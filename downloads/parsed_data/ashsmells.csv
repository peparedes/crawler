"event","i've had an interesting day.&nbsp; not feeling upset just bored.&nbsp; heres my day: i woke up late, went for a walk with the dog and we played outside for a bit (my&nbsp;garlic is still trying desperatly to grow) then came in and read the paper, ignored the jehovas witness that came to the door (not only because im an asshole but because i dont like answering the door to strangers when im home alone) ,&nbsp;took out the trash,got the mail, cooked some&nbsp;lunch (lovely leftover pork loin)and listened to sports talk, &nbsp;then i went online(now).&nbsp; this part time student thing isnt working out for me.&nbsp; i dont know what to do with my time.&nbsp; later ill probably play civilization III and attempt to finish a comic im drawing.&nbsp;or maybe ill make bread. &nbsp;this is pretty much how my days are + alittle bit of work and a little bit of school and homework.&nbsp; I wish i didnt always sleep so late.&nbsp;&nbsp;

anyways, it wouldnt be an&nbsp;entry without alittle bit of a rant.&nbsp; the paper this morning had an article i regretably started to read.&nbsp; im pretty selective about what i read.&nbsp; i check the picture, the title, the section of the paper its in and the first line.&nbsp; this article was in the supplement which is one of the sections im willing to read (automotive and buisness are the 2 sections i look through last if at all) and it looked like it was about a scientific study from the picture, a lady holding a test tube, so they had me.&nbsp; after the first paragraph not only did i realize i had read the article before but that i thought it was stupid the first time i saw it.&nbsp; i dont know why this same article keeps appearing.&nbsp; it was the same old premise, the ""debate"" women face of whether to dedicate thier time to a career or children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

the article grossed me out suggesting women ""need to direct career drive toward mating"".&nbsp;&nbsp;just as icky ""women who want to have children should make it a priority in thier twenties to find a partner"".&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks penelope trunk(the author),&nbsp; i was gonna start looking in my 60's.&nbsp; She goes on ""your ovaries will not last longer than your career"".&nbsp;&nbsp;not only is that statement&nbsp;gross its patronizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;ive seen a similar article in Time and i know ive seen it in other places.&nbsp; there are much better things to write about.&nbsp;&nbsp;
so what is it trying to achieve? to inform women thier biological clock is ticking? to nudge career girls back towards the home?&nbsp;is it to comfort stay at home moms who chose to have kids over a career?
&nbsp;what kills me is the article fails to mention that the average person can handle both, and usually has&nbsp;to.&nbsp; i say person because men also have children they want to spend time with and care for as well as wanting to excell at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
there are sooo many dumb things about this article.&nbsp; the stereotypes it presents, for one, are idiotic.&nbsp; who is so driven to have a career that they neglect sex/relationships and more importantly does someone like that even want kids??
who can even afford to have this debate?&nbsp;&nbsp;
If taken in a vacume, the article is easy to read. maybe if i were a guy i wouldn't give it a second thought.&nbsp; but im stuck relating it back to myself a person who intends&nbsp;to work&nbsp;untill retirement age (i think ill go crazy if i dont. all this free time is making me nuts) and who plans on having kids.&nbsp; &nbsp;ill have to do what a majority of women in this country do, balance."

They played a phenominal season bending not breaking until the final minute of the final game.&nbsp;<br />Lots of people were gloating after the super bowl.&nbsp; What kills me is they are people who don't watch football (aside from the super bowl).&nbsp; Its like walking in on the last act of a play.

"event","Sooo, its been a real long time since ive written anything. odds are no one reads this anymore sooooooo im gonna think outloud/vent/rant.

i just watched thelma and louis for the first time. it was kinda funny, kinda good but also had some kinda crappy parts.  i liked the whole desert redneck trucker feel, and really how can you go wrong with a movie where the main characters go crazy and do whatever they want. quite good, quite good.  

tv land was running it and the dialog was extremely censored.  this was ironic cause it was only the dialog that was censored. they still showed all the sex and violence(i think, it was the first time).  one bit that killed me was them replaceing the explative 'jesus christ' with 'judas priest' .  it was really annoying.  like its ok to show gena davis get raped but they cant drop any j-bombs.  who are they censoring this movie for??? christians? i like to believe that if a christian can handle watching murder and rape and adultery and drunk driving they can handle hearing christs name in vain.  

i considered writing tv land a letter, but im not that kind of person.  and then like i always do i started playing devils advocate(no pun intended).  there are lots of times people have said things that offend me.  usually they are using the beautiful words gay and fag incorrectly.  for the first time the other day i took a stand on it.  i was working with another student on a project which he kept saying was 'gay'.  long story short i told him that i would like it if he stopped saying that while we were working on the project.  i tried to be casual about it i didnt want to be an angry lesbian.  he felt extremly bad about it.  i didnt mean to humilliate him or anything, i just like for people to be aware that they are saying 'thats gay ' to someone who actually is gay.

anyways, i started thinking, what if a christian told me not to say 'jesus christ' because it hurt thier feelings.  and then i realized i honestly wouldnt feel bad.  i felt alittle guilty, like maybe im insesative.  i think its different though.  when someone says 'thats gay'  they are actually saying 'thats stupid' and that things that are stupid are also gay.  when i say 'jesus christ'  what im really saying is 'shit' or 'crap' or 'ouch' or 'woops' or 'god im such a dope'.  im not saying anything negative about christianity or christians or jesus.  im not denouncing anyone.  

im not sure why people say 'jesus christ'  when they drop something on thier foot or forget something important or any of the other reasons they say it.  somehow it found its way into vernacular.  the reason christians dont like it is because the bible says its wrong to take the lords name in vain.  i dont think there is anything else thats offensive about it and because im not into the bible i dont feel guilty or bad about saying it.  even if i were into the bible, i'd still say it because im on my way to hell anyway.  

i dont mean to hurt anyones feelings.  and i know i would censor myself if i had to work with someone who cared.  aside from that im gonna drop some j-bombs, its a great way to express my self as an atheist.  
Jesus Christ!! God Damnit!!!!! 

p.s. if you work for tv land i think you guys are idiots.  you are soo clearly pandering to religious viewer, because there is no consistency to what you have decided to censor.  i dont need cable tv try to shove religion in my face anymore than it already does.  Lets confine that shit to Daystar people!!!"

"event","Thats right i celebrate the holiday and not what it stands for.&nbsp; i feel no guilt&nbsp;over being hypocritical in this situation.&nbsp; Lots of non christians celebrate these holidays and make them thier own.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its all riendeer and eggs, chocolate and beer and ham and turkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sorry if i offend but i had to let that out. i just saw jesus camp and i am thoroughly shaken.&nbsp; It would be amazing if a tv network would broadcast this film, cause its important to see.&nbsp; religious fundamentalism is always hard to watch but its especial scary when the&nbsp;fundamentalists are american and vote.&nbsp; Jihad/crusade all over the middle east but stay the hell away from americas voting booths.&nbsp; i think this country needs more muslims. we need very badly not to have a christian religious majority.

an interesting quote used in the film: india is the most religious country in the world, sweden is the least.&nbsp; we are a nation of indians ruled by swedes. i gues we should start governing with faith! fundamentalists lead on!!. . .&nbsp;

if you are a thinking person all of thier arguements crumble as they are processed by your brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine india: certainly not better than the usa, lots of disease and a caste system almost (if not ) a third world country. Yummy. Now sweden:&nbsp; one of the highest standards of living in the world,&nbsp; one of the lowest crime rates in the world.&nbsp; those goddamn godless bastards.&nbsp;&nbsp;this is just one small peice of rhotoric that was used that is deeply&nbsp;flawed.&nbsp; all the idiocies that they preach can be recognised by a person with a highschool education.&nbsp; in the film i love the tiny plastic fetuses they use durring one of the sermons especially the 7 week old one with clerly defined fingers and toes. give me a fucking break.

i could go on. its like im as inspired as the fundamentalists. ive been touched! i need to get the word out!!&nbsp; they see people ""sinning"" and they are inspired to intervene.&nbsp; i see people preaching ignorance and i am inspired to intervene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

religion is &nbsp;soo hollow and thinking is soo satisfying.&nbsp; its like comparing counting to real math.&nbsp; the brutal truth is more beautiful than anything anyone ever made up.&nbsp; to feel hate and pain and not to fear it but to control it and understand it is real strength.&nbsp; to feel something in your heart that was not delivered to you by any human being, something that is purely an interaction between you and the world is real spirituality.&nbsp; i probably sound like a nut.&nbsp; religion has never inspired me.&nbsp; to me it always seemed like part of culture.&nbsp; my people dont walk around naked my people dont eat with thier hands my people believe in god and jesus.&nbsp; christianity is as inspirational as using a fork to eat your food.&nbsp; a real spiritual awakening came for me when i realized that god may not exist. it came slowly over about&nbsp;1 months somewhere between being rejected by someone i loved deeply and driving in the dark with my sister telling me about her thoughts on death.&nbsp;(mallory is surprisingly dark.&nbsp; the world is too ugly and&nbsp;cruel for her, if there is a god im angry at it for not making this world kind enough for her/ for making her feel so much of the suffering which isnt her own.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
anywho, i have found that faceing the void left by god is more inspiring than having god there.&nbsp; the world is a different place if there is no entity with all the answers.&nbsp; if there is no god that only makes this planet a more&nbsp;rare and magical place. No entity thought this place up. it cant be explained away with a ""god made it that way"".&nbsp; its all small and fleeting and precious and you through something you dont understand you are able&nbsp;to experiance it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
with out a god or church limiting your thoughts you can follow them wherever they lead (yeah i sound fruity i know im just thinking outloud online).&nbsp; you dont have to try and understand job or sodom and gomorah you can wonder ""do trees know that they are taller than flowers or do all plants feel the same?"" or ""i wonder whats happening 1 million miles from this very spot"".&nbsp; my thoughts may seem stupid but if you really think about it so is job and sodom and gamorah.&nbsp; the real benefit is you can think blasphemous things like "" i wonder if medical science&nbsp;has saved as many people as christianity has killed"" it would be fascinating if they broke even.&nbsp; people should give thier thoughts value, they shouldnt&nbsp;supress them&nbsp;to follow a specifically dictated 2000 year old path.&nbsp; if you dig around in your mind enough you may find something worthwhile to society. &nbsp;feminism, psychology and astonomy all arose from ideas that challenged common religious beliefs.

Shit i could go on and on (i kno swearing makes me less credible but im writing this for me, so fuck credebility that dirty fucking cunt) but i will only go on alittle bit more.&nbsp; the punch that knocked god out came to me in the shower.&nbsp; i was thinking about anatomy. my friend laura saw some of devincis original anatomical drawings and she told me that a couple of them were incorrect.&nbsp; medical science 1000 years ago was pretty weak.&nbsp;i continue thinking about mideival medacine, about&nbsp;bloodletting and trepanning. people were crazy back then. how strange that people spent thier whole lives trapped in these bodies that they didnt understand.&nbsp;it seems like you should know your body better than anything in the worl but up until 100ish years ago humans were lost.&nbsp; imagine if medical science were the same now as it was when the bible was written.&nbsp; (life expectancie's in the 40s)&nbsp;

&nbsp;it is not acceptable for us to treat our bodies the way we did 2000+ years ago&nbsp;so why is it acceptable for us to treat or minds that way? there was only one answer in the shower that day and for all days since. it came to me like the singing of angels : ITS NOT."

"event","one of the most poignant moment of last summer came while riding the van from Stanislaus reservior back to camp.  me, two other councellors and 7 campers were heading back after a 2 day canoe trip. i really missed Kat.  

durring the trip i had begun to realize how young the cits were. we had made french toast for breakfast the day before and one of the girls scrambled the leftover egg for me.  she asked me how it was and then told me she had never made scrambled eggs before.  that seemed so odd to me.  i could scramble an egg in my sleep i probably have them at least once a week.  i kno most people arent like me but to have never made them before didnt seem right. things like that make you notice someone is young. i also remember noticing how young they were in how they treated me.  they gave me the sort of respect that i felt i hadnt earned.  to me there didnt seem to be any real reason for them to treat me that way, listening carefully to the things i said and wanting my acceptance.  it seemed odd and unnecessary.
 i was happy when the trip was over. i couldnt wait to see Kat again and to tell her about my canoeing adventures.  it was also isolating to be away from all the rest of the camp staff. on the ride home we listened to a cd one of the girls burned.  lots of bubble gum pop and stuff from musicals.  

ever listen to a song that made you understand a situation better? ever know something but not really understadn it? confused? this is better if i just finish the entry instead of trying to describe what i felt. one of the songs on the cd was 5 for fightings 100 years.  i was missing Kat so one line in the song really struck me 
""I'm 22 for a moment
She feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars"" (well all of it except the mars part im not quite sure what that means)
at the time i was 22 and she did feel that good, and we are on fire(in a good way;D).  ok so the song had me, that guy was talking about me and love and how great it was.  
""15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
15, there's never a wish better than this""  my mind follows the story teller and i try to remember 15. hmm 15.
i start thinking about 15 and how different it was.  when i was 15 i had never kissed anyone, i didnt know how to drive i hadnt had a job. at 15 i was terribly akward. the cits were all about 15.  they werent just kinda young they were really young, of course they thought i knew stuff. i did know stuff. stuff like how to quit a job and how to handle a breakup, how to file an accident report and how to avoid hangovers, how to apply to a college and how to open a bank account. 
 all of a sudden i understood this group of kids. they werent odd peers they were 15 and trying to figure stuff out and i felt wonderful for being part of that. in that moment i cared deeply for each of them and wanted nothing but good things to happen to them.  i hope they all find thier way. 

at least now they could make scrambled eggs. . . 

anyways i could go on but its getting late. i just heard that song and it reminded me of the campers i worked with all summer . . . and good times with one of the most beautiful people ive ever known * * *."

"event","ok so i have been putting off viewing my grades because ive been scared of what id see.  at the end of every semester its like this. part of me expects to be kicked out of school. this is why i havent bought myself any umass lowell bumper stickers or sweatshirts. its kinda supersticious but i feel like the semester i buy something will be my last.

 if/when i do graduate i will be totally blown away. if/when it happens expect massive merry making from me. itll be all parties and smiles if/when i make it.
 
i talked to mallory about my fears while we were driving to my aunts house on christmas day. i talked about how i feel like im always struggling and how ive always felt like that in school. we tried to figure out if there was any part of my major i was passionate about.  I like how my classes make me think in a way i wouldnt normally think and i like drafting using auto cad.  she laughed at how the thing i enjoyed most was also the most artistic thing that i get to do, the drafting. im not as passionate about school as i am about other things, and i think thats been a huge disadvantage.  knowing that was kind of comforting.  but i have come so far, i am so close to the part where i actually get to go to work.  ive always felt bellow average at school but i have never felt bellow average working. i think thats why i like really enjoy the labs that accompany my classes.  anyways im rambling.  me and mal drove and listened to little orphan annie on her ipod.  i felt better knowing id be ok no matter what happened."

"event","yeah well lj this is akward, im here and youre here and im not upset. its wierd bumping into you, my little live journal, when im not feeling emotionally unstable. well as long as we are here together i should tell you why im not upset. . . <br />this summer kicked ass, working at camp in california was chalenging but also awsome. for one month i got to shower infrequently and play the role of ""Puck"" the councelor. yeah puck was my camp name . . . camp names are kinda goofy and kinda awsome. it sounds like you are in a cult or something when you talk about your friends Rain and Shamrock but as far as you know thats thier names. i met so many great people, i miss them. it really wasnt like work it was like going away to camp myself. it was the first time i rode a horse or a canoe. i could write this whole entry on camp alone but there was more awsomeness to the summer. i went to ireland for a wedding and got to party with all my irish relatives.&nbsp; they r all really cool people and i miss them.&nbsp; when we go to ireland we always go to the same place, inish moor, because thats were&nbsp;they all&nbsp;live.&nbsp; most nights&nbsp;we would go to&nbsp;a pub and it would be like a party. like a family reunion or something.&nbsp; i miss them.&nbsp; i got to know a bunch of wonderful people this summer and i miss them all. . .&nbsp; <br /><br />now fall is shaping up to be amazing too,&nbsp; in two weeks it will be me and Kats 1 year aniversary.&nbsp; ive never had a one year aniversary and im very excited.&nbsp; we have had alot of really good times.&nbsp; i think shes the reason i havent been spending much time with you lj . anyways i wanna do something really special for it.&nbsp; im excited like its a holiday, like its thanksgiving or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; yes a one year aniversary is really special but can autum be a double&nbsp;great like summer was? . . . possibly.&nbsp; i got a random call this week.&nbsp; it was amanda. initially having her call scared the crap out of me.&nbsp; i think it would take me a long time to type out why it scared me and id probably end up crying on the keyboard somewhere in the process.&nbsp; you can look at past entries and figure out why i might be scared.&nbsp; we hurt eachother alot.&nbsp; but i answered the phone and it wasnt <div class=""ljcut"" text=""scary"">hmm i could say we had a good conversation and that it was nice to hear from her.&nbsp; its a true statement a very true statement but its like saying 'it was wierd when terrorist flew into the twin towers' or like saying 'it was neat when the redsox won the world serries'&nbsp;.&nbsp; 911 was wierd and that was a neat world serries but SHIT theres so much more to it than that.&nbsp; that leaves out the&nbsp;feelings that were present.&nbsp; the emotions that you could feel in your entire body.&nbsp; and yeah it was a phone call not the world serries,&nbsp; but it meant alot to me. i dont even know how to explain why it meant so much to me.&nbsp; we talked for a long time, shes still the same and talking to her makes me realize that im still the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i dont kno if this means things will be ok, but i hope it does.&nbsp; its wierd how believing in a few really good memories can make you forget a TON of bad ones. or maybe its&nbsp;just a subconcious reverence for someone thats taught me so much about myself.</div>"

"event","haha someone at work actually said this. there is no 'if' when you are talking about yesterday. clearly this customer had problems with the concept of time. i thought it was funny. 

but anyways had a crazy good friday night. i actually got to hang out with laura. i missed her.   
yes but tonight is a special night, tonight im going to do something ive been putting off for at least a year now. for the longest time everyones been telling me i have to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless mind and ive been avoiding it because its a love story. poeple say its not sappy. but it wasnt sappy that bothered me, i just didnt want to see something that made me think about love in a positive way. co-dependant foolishnes. after things ended with liza i was angry at that emotion. yeah im childish. it is pretty stupid tho, it can make you believe obvious lies and spend crazy amounts of money and drive crazy distances and well you get so wrapped up in that other person you forget that you are the most amazing person ever(i know you cant imagine me forgetting that but love is crazy). ahh yes its crazy beyond crazy because when you have no faith in it, when you expect the pain, when you think you understand it it surprises you. when you have total faith in it it drops you on your ass and when you have given up on it it works.  its like those girls that only date jerks. 

how about an example.  i had a wiered night with kat 2 weeks ago. she had her friend and sister visiting from california. we went out to a club and it was a wierd night. basically what happened was she was stressed out i noticed her acting wierd and assumed she was giving me 'signals'. that upset me alot, it reminded me of other situations, i know there is a psychological term for this but i dont remember it. re-something maybe? anyways i called her the next day and told her how lousy i felt that night (i even wrote a n lj entry on it). i was all ready to get in a fight.  i expected she would get mad at me for being upset. i was a real ass on the phone to her.  she wasnt an ass back.  her reaction was the sort of thing that would make you believe in love. the thought of making me upset hurt her.  im not sure how to describe her reaction. it was a sad patient loving reaction when i was all ready to argue. i was a bastard and she just listened and tried to address and understand everything i said.  hmm im rambling the point is i need to reconcile the 'love is crap' philosophy with the feelings im having for my Kat.  i think maybe watching this movie will help me  better understand things."

Kat drew me. then kat and her friend irene had this girl dress them up like geisha for a photo shoot thing. and they wandered through the common and got all sorts of attention. and i got a giesha kiss :D which leaves a big red lip mark accompanied by a little bit of white bellow it. i wish kats friend could dress me up like a horny japanese guy so i could chase her around the common. still it was a good time. 

i think my major is starting to really mess with my head. it seems that lately when someone presents a problem to me i feel the intense need to solve it. this semmester i am taking a class in sustainable development (its like economics only you think about the enviornment as well as money) and we have been discussing problems with the way people abuse the enviornment and i got really annoyed when the class ended and the professor proposed no solution. i felt like we had wasted the whole class, like something was missing. like i hadnt learned anything cause he didnt tell us how to stop global warming. then a couple days ago kat called me. we were just talking and she mentioned a project she had. she had to design a prop (shes a technical theater major) that would ooz on command. she only mentioned it in passing but i found myself thinking about it later that night. like how i would handle that challenge. im not sure if im hooked on that feeling of satisfaction you get from solving problems or if ive learned need to eliminate them.

. . . ohh yeah, Team America World Police should NEVER manifest itself in political discussions. dicks fuck pussies but also fuck assholes is a fucking weak arguement . . . maybe i just think that way cause im a lesbian and im not into dicks fucking anything. Argh. so yeah i was thinking about an arguement(lime vodka=political discussion) i had with this kid about democrats and republcans and why he is an independant. talking to him made me realize that there are some people i kno who dont really kno the difference. Heres why i am a democrat: when my father was 3 his father died. him and his 4 sisters were raised on welfare without it they would have been totally screwed. he got through college on low interest government loans and now i (and my sister) are both in state schools funded by tax money. how could i not be a member of a political party thats done so much for me? democrats are the pro-social programs party the republican idealogy is that people will take care of themselves through capitalism. ha and thats not even mentioning gay rights. the point is all the positive interaction ive had with government has come from programs put in place by the democratic party. so yeah im a democrat cause i am descended from poor people i gues. That and dicks fucking anything just doesnt do it for me."

"event","yeah so California was wonderful. I went to the aquarium and a strip club, a japanese garden and the beach, some awsome restaurants and shops and i saw two movies. I did all of this with Kat. It was a great 5 days. and yesterday i came home to all the crap i left behind. school crap and car insurance stuff that needs to be sorted out.  thats an over simplified description of the stuff i came home to. i think im too good at ignoring problems. things that would stress other people out fade easily from my mind. i wish i were better at describing stuff. 

anyways i figured id get sick of Kat after spending five days with her.  i kno laura and i started getting on eachothers nerves after just one day when we went to new york (but then again i wasnt dating laura). but i didnt get sick of Kat. i figured we'd argue alittle but we didnt. actually i miss her. its like 5 days wasnt enough. i get to see her again monday, maybe that when we'll fight. things are just so good i feel like something bads gotta happen eventually. its like shes too good to be true."

"event","<P>ohh yes dont u love relizing the morning after uve been drinking that uve made a total ass of yourself? i appologize for this not making sense the room is still spinning alittle. yeah im a shithead. its a classic cause and effect relationship. cause: your employer holds a christmas party effect: you must get drunk and turn into a big douche. ok maybe im being alittle dramatic i dont think i was a total douche but i got pretty stupid. <lj-cut text=""i woke up this moring feeling like i had a head full of glass, then i started to remember stuff. . . ""> </P>
<P>the night started off inocently enough. i planned on making an appearance cause christa really wanted me to go. i was gonna have a drink say high to everyone and then go home. so i head down to the tewksbury country club at 730ish planning on leaving at 930ish. i however didnt have a clearly planned exit strategy and that may have been my problem, that and of course alcohol. i came in said hi to nicole andrew dave and little meagan. little meagan doesnt work at mahoneys anymore so it was a real treat seeing her again. she was always my favorite person to work with. we goofed around alot and i always felt really comfortable talking to her about stuff. after saying hi i went and got a rum and coke and went over and talked to cathy. cathys been working there forever. if u want an idea of what shes like just imagine if jan brady were in her late 50s and had a personality like that pissed off old lady from those greating cards. u kno shes always saying something funny about how life sucks. anyways, yeah rum and coke got me talking to people more than i usually do. im usually so nervous around nicole because shes cute and shes probably one of the sweetest people ive ever met. shes sweet to a fault and its not the kind of sweet that comes from insecurity. its a silly kind of sweet that comes from a person wholeheartedly believeing other people r good. when we first started working together shed always say hi to me and smile alot when she talked to me. i thought she was flirting like she was into me but she does it to everyone. </P>
<P>it was cool to be chill enough to talk to her. then christa and boby came. we were all standing around talking and every once and a while christa would just randomly go 'ashley drink up'. haha yeah classic christa.&nbsp; not sure how to describe her. classy is not a word id use. i gues if u could imagine taking a sailor and trapping him in the body of a 19year old vegan you would have something close to christa. shes like my sister in a way only much louder and angrier. boby is a good guy. hes pretty smart and mellow. then mike came. ohh yeah mike the life of the party. boby was buying drinks for mike and christa. so we were all on our way to getting inebriated. its so strange partying with coworkers. after my second drink i had nicole giving me random numbers and id tell her what department they were. she was laughing her ass off. </P>
<P>later on i went over to the lesbian table to see tricia. a bunch of the older ladys went without thier husbands so they joked around about how thiers was ""the lesbian table"". anyways tricia works at the sevens on charles street and we talked about how my father used to work at the beacon hill pub.&nbsp; she talked for a while about the two bars u can tell she really likes working there. i talked to my father about it today and he thinks he remembers her. how fucked up. but yeah i gotta go down there sometime on like a thursday or friday cause thats when she works. shes a pretty cool lady. </P>
<P>but yeah i went back up to the bar for my 3rd drink and i realized i only brought 10$ with me and id already spent it. damn. so i hung around and talked with little meagan and dave. dave is going to school for engineering so we talked alittle about that. he took calc 2 and hated it so i warned him about calc 3 and fluid mechanic (god fucking damn u fluid mechanics!). also i told him how easy and wonderful differential equations was when u understood it. wow maybe i am a nerd. anyways it was a good convo and it was really cool to talk engineering with someone.&nbsp; i also talked to big meagan (who is shorter than little meagan but shes older and thats why shes big) she kept calling me baggins. she was pretty drunk but she looked really good for having just had a baby. meagan and laura r could be twins (for those of u who know laura r) both delicate looking irish girls who are in fact not that delicate at all. she was really happy to see me which made me feel good. yeah ok i used to have a crush on her&nbsp;way back&nbsp;when&nbsp;but then she started dating jay the pestecide guy and they got married and had a baby. </P>
<P>so while i was talking to meagan jay came over and offered to buy me a drink. another rum and coke we did a little cheers and i went back over to christa and boby and them.&nbsp; everyone was dressed so nice, there were people in suits and coctail dresses and stuff. everyone was all made up. i showed up in jeans and a sweatshirt cause i didnt realize it was so fancy. i didnt really have any makeup on but that was done intentionally cause i kinda wanted people to realize i wasnt at this party to ' meet people '. yeah cause no one at my work knows im gay. its a huge pain in the ass but this entry is already really long and if i start talking about how much it sucks itll be another couple page. by the way i think pot makes me really chatty hence the long stupid entry. i think its the pot anyways.</P>
<P>so yeah its about midway through the 3rd drink that stuff gets hazy and i assume my perceptions were pretty off. i end up talking to nicole again this time about her finger which she cut off at work a month ago. tell her shes gotta show it off more so i show it to everyone that comes over and she laughs and goes along with it. i show it to brandon barrys son. barry is the bastard manager that hates everyone. hes kind of a meathead and a sexist. so yeah his sons alittle like that too. they are both wearing suits. branons is a black suit with a black tie. its like one of the suits from men in black. so i show him nicoles busted finger and he reminds me that hes the one that drove her to the hospital. then nicole asks him to name any number from one to one hundred he does and i tell him what department it corresponds to. we do a couple numbers then hes like ok 54 and my mind goes blank. that bothered me all night. right now i think its decorated wreaths but im not positive. it might be artificial wreaths. Anyways i feel bad for anyone thats read this far. so much writing about nothing and its probably full of typos.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>so brandon nicole and i talk for a bit and brondon asks me if i wanna do a shot of tequila with him. i instantly turn him down cause i hate tequila. so he asks me if ill do a shot of whisky. . . great cause whiskey is much better(sarcasm). but he tells me its his christmas wish for me to do a shot with him then nicole says ' thats funny it was my christmas wish that ashley would do a shot with u too'. so i had a shot of whiskey which i hate. 5 min later my head is just floating. brandons telling me how impressed he is that i kno the departments so well. personally i think its kinda sad that i know them so well. he asks me to dance i turn him down cause i cant dance and hes starting to wierd me out. so i go over and talk to boby and christa. christa goes out to the dancefloor and im there talking to boby. fucking whiskey. i remember telling him something about 'keeping an eye on his woman' (boby is christas boyfriend) which is funny if you kno im a lesbain but i think it probably just came off as creepy. maybe he was too drunk to notice. i showed boby how to do the handshake where you knock shoulders and he thought it was really cool. he had me do it for christa. see boby wasnt creepy brandon was creepy. guys r great when they treat u like a person and u can just be chill. but yeah christa was out on the dance floor shaking her ass and stuff and i said something like 'ohh she wants it bad' in my sleezy guy voice. mallory knows what thats all about. its just me trying to be funny i think bobby thought it was funny but christa didnt and she actually slapped me. then 3 seconds later it was like 'oh my god i cant believe i did that '. fucking whiskey. and thats the stupidity i do remember. im sure there was more that i dont. or more that i didnt even recognise.&nbsp; midnight came and everyone left. i goofed around in the hall with nicole waiting for mike and christa and boby and anyone else that was going to jays house afterwards.&nbsp; i got to ask her something ive been wondering for a long time. whats so damn funny in the florist dept? ill be working up at the cash register and ill just hear her laughing like crazy about something denise has said. laughing like someones tickling her like that kind of uncontrolable laughter. and her reply was she didnt kno and we laughed about it. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>omg this is what happens when i get no sleep. i have to process the days events somehow. cause: no sleep effect: longest lj entry ever.&nbsp; jays was ok i was just really dizzy i just wanted to sober up. and then someone passed a pipe to me. it looked like kats pipe and i started to miss her. i think i texted her after i took a hit but i dont really remember. i kno i talked to mal, she called me. i burnt my thumb taking my second hit and i think i took one or two after that. i think its important to keep track of how many drink or hits of something u take which i did. how responsible ! but then i realized i didnt kno what exactly i was smoking. not so responsible. someone asked me what it was but i dont remember who. god i talked to everybody. i talked to this guy in a suit about hockey later i find out he is peter mahoney he&nbsp;owns the winchester store. i talked to this one lady about how expensive it is to live in tewksbury. i met this kid from the ukraine. i watched mike rego get really high i talked to herbie about dali and i saw nicoles tattoo. brendon and i talked alittle about the hebrew hammer which is probably one of my favorite xmas movies of all time. then for some reason i told him hes gotta see i heart huccabees and nicole got all excited and started quoting the movie. it made me so happy. god damn my childish nature shes a cool chick and we probably could be good friends but because she happens to be pretty i am totally freaked out by talking to her . . . well except when im drunk. yes so nicole and i are both laughing about i heart huccabees and talking about how kick ass jason schwartzman is brandon kinda randomly interrupts with something like 'i wanna ask you to be my girlfriend'. ive said alot of fucked up things to girls but damn he might have me beat. then he started laying on a guilt trip saying stuff like 'u wont even respond' but nicole kicks ass and changes the subject to how crazy it was hearing about how rick held up a bank. the night went on there was alot less talking some people fell asleep and i made one more stupid ass move. i let brandon drive me back to my car. ok it wasnt totaly stupid cause hes not a big guy and he was creepy but u could also tell he prides himself on being a gentlemen u kno holding doors and trying to be charming and all that.&nbsp; so yeah everything went ok. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i went home and couldnt sleep. i wanted to talk to someone. the last half of the night all i wanted was for kat to be there. the part at jays house. i probably would have spent half the night outside making out with her. it was pretty warm out and there were no clouds so you could see all the stars and jay has a beautiful pond. it sucks spending the night with a bunch of people doing lots of talking and then realizing the next day that ur either never gonna see them again or that they dont understand u half as well as you think they do. it was so good to call kat when i got home. it would have been even more wonderful to come home to her but what r u gonna do : P i dont really remember what was said but i remember how it felt. i love her so much. when im drunk the part of my head that thinks in words turns off and the part that feels things and sees&nbsp;things is left on. i remember feeling really good. like a peaceful warm sensation. its not the kind of good feeling u can get at a party. its too pure. i want her to come home. last night was fun but not half as fun as just laying in bed together talking. and theres no hangover when i spend the night with Kat in fact theres usually the exact opposite, which is a good breakfast. shes such a beautiful person i love talking to her and learning about her. yeah but this is getting cheezy. i just wish shed come home.</P>"

. . . ahh yes and y is it i am talking so much about work ? because i fucked up my fluid mechanics test and i dont want to think about school. i am fucking up that class and its really really bothering me. it sucks when you stress out about something that you cant do anything about. eh im meeting with the prof on wed . . . i think he scales his grades so theres something to feel happy about. so yeah my money problems will be fixed on thursday my school problems who knows when. :("

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ok so we've got the rich girl, the nerd, the jock, the trouble makerand the wierd chick. we've got some other characters they should have included. like the kambodian war refugee or the washed up musician or the illegal alien marine or the know it all construction worker(its good to have someone that knows all the answers in a class full of rhetorical questions). its not even a class really its pure entertainment, well its entertainment as long as the professor doesnt try to teach. and i always leave that class feeling like the world is so fucked up. today we were talking about social classes. one of the philosophers from this weeks reading was carl marx so part of the discussion was on classes and whether the wealthy are responsible for caring for the poor. </P>
<P><lj-cut text=""class-ist""> </P>
<P>yeah so Jiaro was telling us why the wealthy should feel responsible for taking care of the poor. he was telling stories about what its like for poor people in columbia and how alot of rich people throw thier money away on things like fancy cars.&nbsp;annie is from concord so she has alot of wealthy friends and she starts talking about what they r like but she doesnt condem them the way jairo does. she tells us about her friend who failed out of college and her friends father called the university and got her enrolled again right away. so jairo stared talking about how unfair it is that some people have to work so hard for everything while others have it handed to them.&nbsp; he was really bitter and it was kinda sad.&nbsp;</P>
<P>its so much easier to be class-ist than racist. its easy to assume that someone wealthy is spoiled and has had an easy life and its just as easy to assume that someone thats poor has no class and is ignorant. thats why u gotta love being middle class. u can do&nbsp;cheap&nbsp;poor people stuff and fancy rich folk stuff.&nbsp; i gues the ideal situation would be to not have a social class, to just be so that everyone feels like they can relate to u. but i like were i am. i think there was one day last summer when i left lizas cottage on the cape to go into work at mahoneys. i went from mrs. littenberg-brown asking me to try the mahi mahi to mary mcphee telling me about the fire in the trailer next to hers. <STRONG>gotta love the contrast</STRONG>. its important to be in touch with it all cause if u get absorbed into one community u really lose out. haha example: highschool . . . kids get so absorbed in highschool and they think thats what the world is like. and folks get absorbed into thier country club or trailer park and they forget that theres more to the world than that.&nbsp; my recomendation to those people take a philosophy class, if you have the means : ( </P>"

"event","yup its that time of year again time for me to write an entry praising Thanksgiving, my favorite holiday.  could it be the food? the family? the food? the pie? the food?? who knows but i love it. when i was a kid thanksgiving was always at my grandparents house. now that they live with us its at our house. so i have relatives from maine and virginia and vermont that come and stay here. its like the Cosby show for a few days every year. you know how there were always so many people in the cosby house and cliff was always trying to get everyone to move out. 

im sorry ive had a glass and a half of wine so this might sound stupid. another bonus of it being thanksgiving, the house is filled with all sorts of food and alcohol :D.  

but yeah life in the cosby house. its all that cute family stuff. like every 4 years or so theres a new cute kid. mallory is rudy and now that mallory isnt cute anymore they had to bring in macenzie, who would be olivia(because sandras kids really werent that cute).  and theres all that corny family stuff like adults telling stories about thier kids when they were babys and remanising about what not. cute and funny and always something going on like the cosby show.

yes and i have my cliff huxtable moments. i was sitting down talking to machenzie, my 3 year old cousin from virginia, and i said something to her about brushing her teeth and she paused and looked at me like i was from another planet. she says ""speak english"". my dad and my aunt laugh i was a little offended and my aunt goes ""she doesnt like your accent"". yeah so my boston accent is so bad 3 year olds notice it. kids say the darndest things!"

"event","<P>should be doing fluid mechanics homework, or engineering materials homework or studying for structural analysis but im not in the mood for that. my head is not working right now. <BR>friday night was kinda busy. i posted an item on ebay because im freaking broke and figured i could get alittle money for it. . . if there are any lord of the rings fans out there you should <A href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/4-maps-of-Tolkiens-middle-earth-and-companion-book_W0QQitemZ6578448852QQcategoryZ73518QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"">check it out</A> its high quality. probably gonna try selling some other stuff because my stupid car needs stupid insurance also im gonna see if they need help in the nursery dept at work maybe theyll throw me some of that overtime pay.</P>
<P>&nbsp;after posting that thing on ebay i went to lauras house for cake and finally after years of speculation had actual proof that laura does in fact have a brother.&nbsp; it was cute bring there with her family and this year just like last year there were stories about what she was like as a baby.&nbsp; and the cake was kick ass the crawfords know good food.&nbsp; i left there house at like 830 and headed over to the tsongas arena for my first game thing. it was really more of a schrimage. it was so much fun i got two goals and it felt good to finally score in some form.</P>
<P>&nbsp;yeah not much else going on. still feeling very distracted and playful. its awful my mind is such a&nbsp;lovely thing and its getting all fogged up.&nbsp;im so lost. i think about kat so much.&nbsp;i cant wait till i can see her again maybe then ill be able to think clearly. the more i talk to her the more i realize i have unresolved issues with myself, things that are still fucked up from what happened with amanda.&nbsp;thats why im lost. im not used to likeing someone this much and having them like me back. i get scared of saying sweet things because i feel like they will just make her angry which is really fucked up.&nbsp; and then theres love. i understand that love is this insane intense scary thing but im not sure of much else about it.&nbsp; i thought i was in love with amanda but stepping back from it i realize it was all madness.&nbsp; </P>
<P><lj-cut text=""so how is love different from madness?""> </P>
<P>sooo lost. yeah this thing is gonna get long so ill be kind and use one of these lj cut things. amanda, i could write a book about the shit that happened. i told her that a long time ago and she didnt like the idea but its true.&nbsp; a few days ago i had an hour to write a 4 page paper for my hippy philosophy prof. on something life changing so i wrote about what happened between us. it was so easy the words just flowed. so basically im saying im never going to be able to sort out all the shit that hapened. it is so dense layers apon layers of madness. i thought it was love and now i have no idea what love is. mallory says love is when u dont care about cleaning up the other persons puke, when they seem beautiful in the worst situations. that definition doesnt really help me much. it seems like that definition could work for how you feel about a really good friend. im so lost. the way it felt with amanda was like she knew me in a way no one could ever know me and in a way i could never describe.&nbsp;there was even something there the first time we talked.&nbsp;a crazy deep understanding. . . or so i thought. </P>
<P>so yeah i was a dopey high school kid who had never had many friends and was into girls way before d ever admit it.&nbsp;i think me liking girls got in the way of me being friends with alot of people because i would get bashful. i think pretty girls will always make me shy. i had never had a boyfriend or girlfriend and had wondered&nbsp;if i ever would.&nbsp; then i meet the girl next door and we become best friends. i become so unbelievably close to her. one night we are driving around with our other friends and we r talking about how much we will miss eachother when we go away to college. we go thru the whole im gonna miss u so much and she told me i was the best. theres almost no way to one up being called the best so i told her 'i love u'. yeah im not sure how often friends say that to eachother but im sure it happens. i have never cried tears of joy but i gues i got her to do that. later that year i wrote her a note telling how much i loved her and how much she meant to me.&nbsp; madness. </P>
<P>yeah when it comes to this stuff i have alot to say . . . i think it will be good to get it all out </P>
<P>anyways all im trying to say is all the stuff that goes along with insane intense scary love happened between us. and it seemed so real. it looks so different now.&nbsp; i wasnt the only one who praised amanda.&nbsp; she was so sweet and always looking to please everyone.&nbsp; she was just one of those people who is good at making other people happy.&nbsp; shed be a great salesman. teachers were always saying she was a gem.&nbsp; she wanted to please everyone.&nbsp; i was confused i thought there was something special about me but it had nothing to do with me.&nbsp; it turns out i was just another person to please. things went on way longer than they should have becuase she didnt want to hurt me by dumping me.&nbsp; see if she dumped me then id be unhappy and if she makes me unhappy thats means shes a terrible and worthless human being.&nbsp; so she stays with me and treats me wierd hoping ill lose interest.&nbsp; shes an ass to me but whenever i confront her on it she makes up some excuse for why shes not herself. and i believe it because i think im in love and i think shes in love with me. madness.&nbsp; things continue like this for way too long and i begin to accept that this is what relationships are like.&nbsp;all the shit makes u feel undesireable.&nbsp; shes not into sex and shes not into me but i can accept it because she loves me. riight. and i do everything i can to win her over to cheer her up and make her happy and when im not successful well damn maybe i should try harder. cause im a niave highschool kid and shes a pretty girl.&nbsp; im ashamed of how lost in it all i got. but affection clouds your mind.&nbsp; we argue and fuck around until she cant take it anymore and we break up.&nbsp; but that doesnt stop the argueing and fucking around.&nbsp; it was all madness even the sweet part at the begining what i thought was some profound understanding was really just her need to be praised. i was a tool.&nbsp; we went from her telling me she'd marry me to her literally spitting in my face over the course of a year. we were both so lost and so naive we had no idea what we were doing and as a result things got beyond fucked up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;i was awful she was awful and the whole was just a giant lesson.&nbsp; the lesson didnt end when the fucking around stopped and i cant be 100% sure its over.&nbsp; now im just thinking about amanda and what id say to her if she were here.</P>
<P>&nbsp;my head was severely fucked with.&nbsp; i wasnt sure thered be a girl after amanda. . . there was and that was a bit of a mess too but not a big mess. it seems like relationships are always a mess.&nbsp; the more i think about love the more upset i am by it. its either plain old crazyness or its some boring form of the love we all like to believe in.&nbsp; no one does it right which leaves me wondering whats the point? im pretty sure ive written this on here before but ill write it again because i like it and i dont think anyones reading this far. its crap for any person to think they are incomplete. i dont think its healthy to believe that you need god or love to be a&nbsp;complete person.&nbsp; i think it makes a person more complete to be able to stand without god or love as a crutch and just be whatever you are.&nbsp;at the time i believed that what i had with amanda made me better but in reality it didnt it just fucked me up. it turned me into someone different.&nbsp; umm yeah if im not arriving at a point im sorry i have one im just getting tired.&nbsp; </P>
<P>i gues the real point is that things with kat scare me. everything happened so fast but it felt so naturual . . . like some sort of unspoken understanding. i feel so good when im with her. it reminds me of things with amanda and it scares me.&nbsp; shes&nbsp;could hurt me alot.&nbsp; i kno love is crap that it just distracts people from thier individual lives. its why couples are so annoying (haha which is funny cause im a couple :P)but my god as jaded as i am theres something about that girl thats just so nice that seems worth the risk. its so strange.&nbsp; what the hell is love anyways? no one will ever come up with a decent definition cause the mind has so little to do with it.&nbsp;so what do u call it when u think of someone and u feel it in ur chest ? is that just affection or lust or attraction? is it love or&nbsp;is love just a fancy word for insanity? . . . this much i am sure of i love the way i feel when i think of Kat. </P>
<P>fuck ive got work to do . . . </P>"

"event","ahh yes kathy gould taken out of context.  its wierd sometimes i like my work and the people i work with other times i despise it and them.  right now im liking it.  the other day there was nothing to do so i wandered thru the place looking for halloween decorations to take down.  there were no halloween decorations but i took my time and found little things to occupy myself with. i poked around the storage pond to see if i could find frogs or leeches. i wandered the green houses and took my time, stopping to smell the flowers.  its a really pretty place when u have time to wander thru it.  after that i got to cover the florist dept so regina could leave early and i just sat around talking with christa, linda and barrys son.  i got to hear all the gossip. i gues karen the bug spray lady used to beat her husband. hehe its probably wrong that i find that funny. it will be fun when christmas rolls around and we get the fire going and the popcorn machine set up.  who knows maybe by then i will dislike it again. 

i saw Kat today. we went for a walk and then had some lunch. after that we went back to her room and . . . hung out for a while until her room mate walked in on us hanging out. then we talked till it was time for her class. so yeah shes a hockey fan, shes a good cook, she likes video games and knives, she eats fire, shes really smart, shes not a vegitarian and shes sweet and funny. i kno i fall fast but how could i help it? ive been in the best mood lately im not sure if its because of her or because im finally getting some exercise with hockey.  i just feel happier.  the other day i was watching the matrix reloaded and the dog was bugging me to play with him like he always does when i wanna just sit down and instead of ignoring him or picking him up i chased him. i chased him around and jumped up on the couch then he chased me and i actually got into it. its very wierd. its a playful mood. its probably a combo of Kat and hockey and a bit o sexual tension."

I showed my friend your profile... and she wasn't too nice about it... but the first thing I said to her was that you seemed like you had a really awesome personality...""<BR>yeah i feel like an asshole. i gues its all a big learning experience. *Dont block someone ur not into it only makes things bad and wierd.&nbsp; its awful when people ur not into are into u and&nbsp;then when u r really into someone u dont kno if they r really into you . confused? this is my journal u people dont have to understand my stupid sentences&nbsp;: P&nbsp;<BR>but thats not the point of this entry. </P>

<P>so yeah that little thing that girl said to me, i think it was meant to hurt me in some way or make me ""feel ugly"" (good word choice by kelly).&nbsp; but actually it did the opposite.&nbsp;maybe my profile sucks, maybe i look like crap in my photo but this girl thought my personality was awsome enough to go against the advice of a friend.&nbsp; thats a huge compliment.&nbsp;maybe im ugly and maybe my profile looks boring and maybe her friend thinks i suck but my personality is good enough that she doesnt feel like shes wasting her time talking to me.&nbsp; Yeah i kick ass.&nbsp;and if im boring i don't care, the only person i need to keep entertained is myself.&nbsp; and i kno im not ugly.&nbsp; ive been compared to a statue by 2 different people (hey this is my journal im allowed to be&nbsp;narcasistic).&nbsp; i gues all this pride can be traced back to this weekend.&nbsp; i make out with a gorgeous funny and bright&nbsp;girl and instantly i get a fat head. right now i am feeling pretty damn good.&nbsp;im sure something&nbsp;will soon&nbsp;knock me down from this high, but its not going to be this thing.&nbsp; </P>"

"event","the title is a sentence from a kid in my philosophy class' paper. the professor read it out loud. the title was 'the best sexual experience ive ever had'.  what a wierd class.  the professor is an old hippy and a writer. and i think he only teaches the class to get ideas for his writing because hes always having us tell stories that relate to philosophy.  anyways just came from that class so i thought id share.
what a busy weekend its been and what a busy week its going to be.  i have work on wednesday and thursday and i have a test on friday.  
last friday night instead of studying for my engineering materials test i went to lauras dorm and hung out with her and her friends.  i got to meet her boy dan who looks just like my cousin cassidy and his friends.  i also got to meet lauras room mate and her friend Kat.  it was definatly a better use of my time than studying because the test was easy and i had such a good time.  i fell asleep on lauras friend Kat while we were watching the wall(not an actual wall the pink floyd movie ""the wall""). spent the night there. i went to bed at 2 and woke up at 6 so i could get to work at 8.  right after work i went back into boston to meet a girl i met online.  we had been talking for about a week and decided to get together for lunch.  we ate at veggie planet because she is vegan. it was an ok time but i wasnt feeling any chemistry.  after that i went to good time emporium with allison and her friend garry.  garry is really into pool and he taught me a few tricks.  after that we went to denny's in nashua. i got sunday off work so i could study all day but i ended up sleeping in till 1130.  i did a fair amount of studying and turned out being over prepared for the test.  so after the test instead of going back to my car to listen to howard stern between classes i sit in one of the couches outside the classroom and finish my fluid mechanics homework. after that i do 2 classes and go to work to train jessica.  jessica has been working for a week but everyone else has avoided teaching her how to cash out the draw so i have to stay late and teach her.  when i got home from work i had to work on a lab report for my engineering materials lab. this morning i woke up at 930ish and started writing a paper for my philosophy class.  at 12ish i went to the library to make coppies of the papers i needed for my dual citizenship.  at 1ish i went into boston with my dad to get my dual citizenship. we take the t in and get off at the boylston shop right in front of lauras dorm. i looked to see if any of the kids smoking out front looked familiar. maybe id bump into Kat.  230 i had my appointment at the irish consolate and by 3 im a citizen, sort of. i have a packet of some kind coming in six months after they have reviewed all my papers.  dad and i got burger king on the way home and stopped at a car wash to get his truck cleaned.  i was home by 430 to finish my philosophy paper. at 7 i had class.  the class is so small now there are like 15 people left.  we talked about descartes and love and how to keep a marriage together and then sex. the professor read one students paper out loud, the one about sex and it steadily got raunchier and raunchier.  hearing about this kids threesome made me laugh but it also made me feel kinda akward so i doodled in my note book while the professor read. as i doodled i thought about the weekend. after reading the paper prof. Koran noticed that i was doodling and really liked it. the guy is such a goof he told me it was wonderful and that i should pass it around for the class to see (pass it around cause its one of those classes where you sit in a circle). so after class i went home and here i am.  
i have to go do laundry now."

"event","yeah so ive said this a million times im not sure if this time it will stick but im finished with getting headfucked by a certain person. drove out to amherst wed evening we were supposed to go into northampton to drink and hang out. she gave me directions and said ""call me before u hit the center of town and ill give u directions to my appartment"". i called, like 15 times w/ no answer before i decided to go into the center of town and goof around for a while hoping to get a call back. hoping that i didnt waste 2 hrs driving for nothing. so i went to a cafe and had a gaspacho went to a bookstore went to newbury comics and then cvs. i saw this huge rainbow on the way back to my car. it was like 1 1/2 hrs before i said screw it but before i left i called mal. i wanted her to check and see if this persons car was in the driveway next door. i wouldnt have been surprised if it was, but it wasnt. i dont kno y she didnt call, but it doesnt matter. there arent many situations i can imagine that would prevent someone from giving a quick call. i came home and went out to eat with mal. 

note to reader: i am not posting this with hopes that i will get responses telling me how much of a jerk this girl is. (if u want to leave those responses u r welcome to :P) its more of a reminder to myself not to get into this situation again. because this is not the first time something like this has happened with this girl and its my own fault."

"event","its been a nice weekend so far. went to the liberty tree mall with allison yesterday. ive been meaning to see her since her accident. she looks surprisingly ok for someone thats been thru what she has. we saw 4 brothers then went back to her house and played monopoly. i didnt plan on being there very long but we had a couple drinks and i lost track of the time. her friend garry came over and we talked and drank. we played a card game called asshole and then a couple drinks later got to talking about sex. asking eachother favorite positions etc. garrys room mates are lesbians so he knows a bit about that kinda stuff and hes convinced that because i like certain things(not getting specific cause my little sister reads this) id probably like sex with a guy more than a girl. i gues one of his lesbian friends is like that and she just hooks up with guys every once and a while to get off. i tried to explain why i doubt thats the case for me but by this time we r all kinda drunk and its hard to make a point when ur drunk. then i get into my whole thing about how gender shouldnt be a huge deal and if u meet an amazing person and u fall for em u shouldnt let gender limit u from experiencing something great. whenever i say that it comes off like im bi but its more like i dont wanna be afriad to let myself feel something. i dont wanna be afraid of straightness the way so many straight people are afraid of gayness. anyways we r all drunk and talking about stuff and garry starts bitching about women and his ex and stuff. and i feel for him cause i kno how much girls can suck. we talked more and he got flirty. he gave me a neck massage and it was really nice. nice not arrousing. i kno he wanted me to get into it and i was still trying to get him to understand that im not into guys. i told him it would have felt just as nice if a little old lady had done it. probably a rude thing to say but i didnt want to lead him on. 
anyways its wierd how i get to see stuff from both sides of the fence. i kno what its like to have a girl not into me and i kno what its like being the girl not into someone. i kno how he felt touching my neck. when someone makes u feel all fuzzy and then u get to touch them its better than being touched urself.ive felt that for alot of girls and i kno how nice it wouldve been for him if something had happened. i dont kno if me understanding would have been any consolation to him. prob not. ahh yes and thats the insight i draw from a drunken night at allisons. i drove home at like 2 with no tension in my neck and sholders. got home realized i was locked out and i had to crawl in a window and right away i pull a muscle in my shoulder. 
worked today 1-6. there were 2 cashiers up front me and andrew. we played cards for a good 2 hours. rummy 500. lindas 8 year old son corey was there watching us. she brings him to work sometimes and he ends up finding someone to follow and annoy. the subject is something he said today after i said the f word about the card game. i caught myself after i said it but he said its ok cause he swears sometimes. he told me i should put money in the swear jar."

"event","but ive got alot on my mind. the last few days have been very wierd. ive been feeling really detatched, im not sure how else to describe it. its a kind of nice free empty feeling. yeah im crappy at describing stuff. its probably because of the heat or all the time ive been spending by myself. not sure.

had a great time at my aunt peggys on thursday. i went to the beach with her and my uncle and thier 3 kids. i went snorkling (is that how u spell it?) for the first time. they live in rockport so we went to a beach near them where there were rocks and stuff and swimming down there with the goggles u can see everything. it was really really cool. ive gotta do that again sometime. i also played in the sand with patrick, kyle and maggie my 3 cousins. its funny how much fun u can have w/a 2year old a 6 year old and an 8 year old. lots of running and swimming. 
had another dream about amanda last night. this time her and my friend ariana were room mates in a dorm and i went by to visit them and they were having celary w/cream cheese only the cream cheese had cocaine in it and they were getting high. they kept offering it to me so i left but instead of walking out into a hallway i walked into a locker room full of guys half dressed in hockey equipment.  i think i keep dreaming of her because im worried something bad will happen to her. i dont think about it durring the day maybe thats y its in my dreams. im not sure y ariana was there. i have been meaning to see her before she goes back to PA. oh well i better go, Strength of Materials is a demanding mistress."

ive been having wierd dreams lately. 3 nights in a row ive dreamt about amanda. not sure what thats all about. in the 1st one i was visiting her in the hospital and she told me that i was a bad person. in the one i had last night she was working at walmart dressed in an army uniform handing out free umbrellas. she told me to leave her alone and that she was ok now. also last night my sister heard me yelling in my room  for my mom so she came in to ask if i was ok and i told her there were guts in my room. i remember doing it too, i remember seeing dog and bird guts on my walls and floor and being scared and just yelling. its wierd, i dont usually remember my dreams.

i gues rob is pretty cool. i dont mind him in my house as much as i did at the begining of the summer. also im kinda excited he might take me to this abandoned assylum. he and his friends go alot. they like exploring. mal told me she saw pictures they took of the place and it looks just like silent hill :D so that means i must go. the beach was great nice weather lots of walking and climbing rocks and playing with my Black Jack. my feet r all cut up from the rocks & shells(fucking barnicles)."

he's a good guy and hes going thru alot of the same shit i remember when i broke up with amanda. part of me is still mad at her. not for leaving me but for not returning my calls. especially when im looking for someone to enjoy art with. it sucks when the people u like dont call back.

"event","holy crap what a busy weekend. redsocks game, freedom cruise and 15 hours of mahoneys goodness. yes should be thinking about maybe studying for class but i want to write in this thing while stuffs fresh in my mind. the baseball game was great. They won, i got to catch up with someone who's really important to me and i also got to get kinda drunk. got home at like midnight-ish maybe later i dont remember and was up at 8, alittle hung over to head into work at mahoneys. there really is nothing like feeling hung over and working in a greenhouse on a 90degree day. got home at 4 slept till like 6 and then got showered and ready for the freedom cruise where there was more drinking. there was also dancing and an irish chick from ireland who sounded just like my dads cousin maryann.  after that was ihop and cheese steak. (im just keeping it brief so i can get to studiying). this time home at 4 and at work at 9. they put me in the greenhouse for a shortwhile then it was up front to deal with hot irritated customers. there was one point near the middle of the day i just felt really crappy. not sick just kinda depressed. i felt really lonely. looking back it probably has something to do with the alcohol, lack of sleep and lack of food.  But i dont think the cruise or game helped either.  a boat full of couples and a baseball game with the first person you ever loved kinda got my mind leaning toward that lonely feeling.  i dont miss sex, i miss that feeling you get from someone that really understands u and still loves u .  haha yeah im a fucking nerd for writing that but whatever this a journal im gonna be personal and just hope people dont read this far.  maybe there r so many typos everyone just quit. i kno im tired there must be tons of them. anyways yeah i think im gonna hate this entry when i read it over. i got home from work at 4 (dave stayed late so i could leave early) and slept till 8. . . or more half slept and thought about stuff. i gues im just feeling blah but it will pass."

"event","thats right and if u want to meet him he'll be at mals graduation party this weekend! yeah im excited, id be more excited if the weather didnt blow tho. im sick of the cold, im sick of class im sick of standing around at work when there r no customers. u kno now that i think of it this week has kinda sucked. the high point was when i saw the new star wars and i still dont really kno what i think of it. there were a couple of things i wouldve changed if i was george lucas.  it was still better than the others and dark which is usually a plus. i saw it with amanda. how wierd is that? i also saw a movie with liza this week, mad hot ballroom. yeah so its been a crappy cold blah week of catching up with people home for the summer. everytime im out with someone its either cut off short cause of class or its so late at night (and the persons so underage :p) i hardly get to enjoy myself. and soon everyone go off in thier seperate directions for the summer and ill be doing the same old shit wondering y i didnt enjoy myself more when they were around. blah. . . maybe im just being pesemistic, yeah thats it ill make my own fun.  next time im in statics class ill imagine im on a spaceship where im the captain and we're on our way to planet birthday where summer is held sacred, once there i'll . . . go over the example problems and study the law of sines and cosines :/  or at mahoneys ill imagine im lost in the jungle and am discovered by a stunning young native girl. . . who hands me a florist order smiles and then walks away. eh i gues things could be worse. at least its not snowing."

<br><br>
Over the course of 3 years John Wayne Gacy, a part time children's party clown, would go on to sodomize, torture and murder over 30 young men, burying most of the bodies under the floor boards of his home.
<br><br>
Gacy would use a chloroform soaked rag to render his victims unconscious, then take them home and tie them up in his basement. He would then proceed to torture them sexually, using a varying range of dildos and sexual toys, eventually strangling them to death with a 2x4 while raping them.

<P>Bitchin good times-my 21st birthday(the family part and the friends part),&nbsp;the NY trip ,&nbsp; boston with cassidy and laura, cape cod with liza and her family, my cottage with liza</P>
<P>Skank ass bad times-&nbsp;those times i couldnt&nbsp;sleep at lizas house,&nbsp;being around bush suporting relatives at patric and kyles birthday, the three weeks i had mono</P>
<P>Things that made me feel good- talking with aron at thanksgiving and my birthday, getting to know kelly, finding out im related to katlyn, gay marriage is legalized in massachussetts, working with little megan,&nbsp;meeting all of kellys friends</P>
<P>Things that made me feel lousy- kerry losing the election, being dumped by liza,&nbsp;that time amanda&nbsp;and i were supposed&nbsp;to hang out and she just never showed up and never answered any of my calls,&nbsp;that night mal and laura and i went to see the new harry potter movie, wine in a box at lizas friend larissas party, the feeling i got everytime one of lizas friends asked me where i go to school</P>
<P>more to write but im freaking starving, so im off. much love to all of you that made my year</P>"

<P>yeah so ive found something i like more than goofing around in boston.&nbsp; its goofing around in new york.&nbsp; laura and i had a really kick ass time there on fri and sat.&nbsp; we started fri morning at my house jumped onto a plane at like 9ish for a comically short flight to newark.&nbsp; they were handing out drinks right after we took off and collecting them quickly before we landed.&nbsp; after that we rode a monorail thru the airport to the train that would take us into manhattan.&nbsp; yeah but this is just the boring part it gets better dont worry.&nbsp; we got into the city at like 1030 and went to our hotel.&nbsp; the guy at the counter was really nice he let us check in way early(check in was at 3).&nbsp; he reminded me of a highschool teacher cause he was kind of old and asked us this trivia question while we were checking in.&nbsp; if you know the name of mrs. bouquets neighbors brother please post it and prove how into dorky british sitcoms you are :p.&nbsp; the room was really small but we didnt stay there long.&nbsp; so we went to little italy for lunch(amazing food and service surprisingly cheap) went chopping in china town and just goofed around that general area for a while.&nbsp; we made it up to soho were we went shopping at this cool little clothing store. i got mallory a great christmas present that i will tell you about later(its not a fun story).&nbsp; we caught a cab back to the room at like 5 and hung around there till like 7ish. we went to time sq and did the touristy thing for about an hour untill we realized everything was insanely expensive and kinda stupid.&nbsp; laura realized this way before i did i was just blown away that they had a hershey store and a resuarant called bubba gump shimp company (haha just like the movie!), yeah those bright lights will make anything seem really cool. so we hopped a cab to grenwich village and ate there.&nbsp; it was a good meal that was about half the price we wouldve paid at bubba gumps or planet hollywood.&nbsp; and we were within walking distance of nyu where lauras friend taylor goes to school and this comedy club lauras friend taylor recommended.&nbsp; it was getting late so we skipped the comedy club and went to taylors dorm to visit him.&nbsp; im usually not so good at meeting knew people but when they started talking about movies i felt comfortable. i think taylor reminded me so much of laura in his taste in movies and tht made me comfortable.&nbsp; that and i just like talking about movies because im a nerd.&nbsp; anyways hanging out with taylor and his room mate turned out being a really good time and a nice change of pace, we werent cold or looking at a map or searching for an atm.&nbsp; it was just us 4 goofing around on the computer telling dirty jokes and talking about the kids in the hall sideways and other movies and tvshows that are great.&nbsp; laura taylor and taylors room mate carl were all kinda stoned so that also added to the relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp; yeah so we left his dorm at midnight, grabbed a cab and were back at the hotel by 1.&nbsp; we watched alittle bit of connan i showered and then we went to bed.&nbsp; the next day we left the hotel at like 10ish to go to the sex museum.&nbsp; it wasnt open when we got there so we goofed around the area until it was.&nbsp; we walked by this dog park which reminded me of nelson and i missed him.&nbsp; the dog park was a fenced off area of madison park where we were walking and the squirels there would let you get really close to them. laura thouhgt it would be great if one of them just jumped at me and attacked.&nbsp; the sex museum was cool.&nbsp; we saw dirty pictures taken between 1890 and 1960.&nbsp; the girls in the 1890s pictures all had really small breasts and kinda chubby bodies.&nbsp; upstairs there was this exibit on china and the chinese attitude towards sex. it was very philosophical and beautiful.&nbsp; the chinse word for sex is the same as thier word for nature, xing, and they believed sex got you closer to nature and your true self. i thought they were very progressive thinkers till i got to the second half of the exibit.&nbsp; foot binding. ick.&nbsp; the exibit was cool tho very different from the first half, the first half seemed like a real museum the second felt like a ripleys believe it or not.&nbsp; still it was cool in a sad sick way.&nbsp; they had an actual preserved bound foot in a case there.&nbsp; what ended foot binding in china was westernization which left me and laura wondering what would end the fucked up 21st century beauty practices, u kno stuff like breast implants.&nbsp; we were wondering that as we had our last NY meal at this little deli right up the street from the museum.&nbsp; ill stop there though i could go on, and tell you about how i was a terrorist for 5 min.&nbsp;lets just say airport security will not be happy with you if you try to bring a belt with a revolver shaped belt buckle home in your carry on.&nbsp; omg i thought i was going to be strip searched.&nbsp; mallory will have to wait a week or 2 for her christmas present to come in the mail.</P>"

"event","ohh fuck me i just had this long entry but comp got fucked so im gonna rewrite it breifly.&nbsp; allisons wedding was sat at focaccias in wilmington. it was small and cute.&nbsp;i dont like her boyfriend.&nbsp;they originally had me seated at the 1st table with people i knew but something got screwed up and i&nbsp; had to sit at table 2 with ruth, her mothers, family and friends. it wasnt bad though i got to kno this one woman named claire who pointed out the people she knew and told me how they were related to allison. after the ceremony allison insisted i sit at the 1st table and squashed me in between her bridesmaids, anna and katlin. i tlked to the groomsmen, 3 goofy 20 something boys, and to anna and allison but spent most of the evening talking to katlin.&nbsp; katlin told me about how before the ceremony allison went to walmart then burger king in her gown. lol i love allison.&nbsp; katlin is a very pretty girl and while i was talking to her i was nervously twisting this ring i was wearing, cause talking to pretty girls makes me nervous(talking to knew people in general makes me nervous but pretty girls r the worst). she asked if it was a cladaugh ring which it was and if i was irish which i am.&nbsp; this got us talking about ireland and she told me about this recent trip she had taken with her father to ireland.&nbsp; it was a funny coincidence that she flew free cause her father works for the airline but it was an even bigger coincidence where they had gone in search of thier roots. a little place called INIS MORE which is the same tiny island my granmother is from and she is related to a woman named BRIDGET DIRRANE which is my grandmothers aunt.&nbsp; so we talked about that for a while she got all excited.&nbsp; it was cool i got a big hug and her number.&nbsp; it would be a total score for me if we werent related. yeah then there was all the customary wedding stuff done allison style. after cutting the cake instead of feeding it to her boyfriend(ok hes her husband now but i dont like calling him that cause i dont like him) she mash it into his face and then he threw a piece at her and got it on her dress.&nbsp; allison had a special dance with her fathers best friend because her father died like 6ish years ago. they played the saddest sonng while they danced katlin and ruth both started crying alot. i thought about allisons father, and what he wouldve thought of this wedding.&nbsp; he was always trying to keep allison and david out of trouble, more so than ruth .&nbsp; he had a&nbsp;rough quiet honest way of dealing with allisons decisions.&nbsp; i dont kno whether or not hed be for this wedding, she did just 3ish months ago breakup with her boyfriend of 5 years.&nbsp; herb wouldve supported her through anything but he wouldve let her kno how he felt about it. she needs someone like that to look out for her.&nbsp; so i think ill stop there ive got stuff ive got to do."

haha yeah im a dumbass, i love the band one cause its soooooo me! anyways long day at work hangin out with my dawg little Meaghan and wondering whats wrong with me . why do i act like a total douche to certain people? i seriously wish i could erase this morning and stay in bed instead of going online. :( .  theres a certain level of comfort i think friends must never reach. each friendship is different. ive discovered the limit with laura is when she starts telling me about her ideal relationship and sexual fantasies. when u find that limit its not necessarily bad. u know what it is so u can avoid it and its a sign that you are really close to someone."

"event","how could i not make this the tittle of my entry? i like the ""my own little spin"" part, makes me feel evil like anne coulter. does the person who wrote this think im a total shit like coulter? i really dont kno, i dont feel like ill ever kno, but here on the ASHsmells factor we like to examine the facts, fair and balanced. blah typing those words makes me feel dirty :P . Fair and balanced what shit the other day i saw them talking about how new evidence shows mathew shephard was killed over drugs, i hate those fucks.
 i prefer opinion over spin, it is MY FUCKING JOURNAL, a record of MY thoughts.  its not an unbiased record of things that happen to me. perhaps a disclamer is needed. yeah but im mad right now and i havent had breakfast and my shoulders still hurt from helping kelly drywall a ceiling(im soo out of shape:( ) and i have to work at two, i fucking hate the christmas rush and i spent 9$ last night that i shouldve saved for the NY trip on a movie about two old fucking assholes running around Nappa Valley and stealing from thier Mothers(Sideways blew!) and i have to take a fucking short story class over winter break and someone i like thinks im a total shit :( . 
enough of that. this has been a really wierd week, not because anything particularly wierd has happened its just been wierd cause ive been thinking alot about things i dont usually think about. God was chosen as the Cocksucker of the Month(http://ruthlessreviews.com/cocksucker/cocksuckerindex.html) on one of my favorite websites (yeah im a fucking nerd i have favorite websites). i thought it was alittle extreme but i still read it and it got me thinking in a way i never really had. this along with listening to alot of bright eyes and modest mouse has had me thinking about god and life and love and trying to ""figure it all out"" (i think being single has alot to do with this too).  lately ive been thinking about how the idea of God and having 1 true love is detrimental because if u buy into either of those things than you accept that you are not complete on your own, that a lover or belief in something bigger makes u whole. which is crap because who is to say what a whole person is ? how can you judge that?i think id like to kno more about phylosophy.  yeah but i gtg eat sorry if this doesnt make sense. im tired and cold and hungry and feeling surprisingly crappy over nothing."

anywho thursday is thanksgiving! thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. my CAD prof calls it 'killing the idian'. ""ohh we are going to be behind the other class 'cause we get a day off for killing the idian"".  thats just the sort of depressing thing i need to think about durring my fav time of the year. blah. but hopefully the holiday will brighten my mood. cause damn am i feelin blah.
 reasons i love thanksgiving:
close to christmas (i find christmas itself anticlimactic - woohoo big word!)
pie/lots of good food(pie kicks ass and damn do i love eating)
lots of good movies on tv 
family comes and stays at my house (we got to knew babies who will be staying at my house along with everyone else. lots of people around means u never get bored)
presents from my moms side of the family(i get a present from my grandma and one from one of my moms siblings, depending on who drew my name)

"event","hey now! so for the last few days ive been feeling kinda crazy. not crazy like wild or wacky, crazy like anti-social sad lonely and confused. i call it crazy because i dont really kno why i feel this way. things arent bad , i got into Umass amherst, i did really well on my calculus quiz and this weekend i made bread and it was really really good. 
i think what started me feeling this way was a movie we watched in ethics class. we've been dicsusing legal punishment and my prof thought that watching a documentry on the patriot act would be a good supplement to the lesson. i havent followed politics after the election at all. after kerry lost i got really sad and decided to take a break because i dont want to be emotionally envolved in politics. but this fuckin movie,like i needed another reason not to like the bush administration. its almost never that something is all bad, even if the redsox lost the world series, it would be one more interesting chapter in thier losing legacy. like every cloud has a silver lining or god never closes a door without opening a window but damn when it comes to this administration i cant see anything good. if anyones got anything good on bush post it as a comment please. thinking about the situation gets me sad and irritated. 
irritated and sad are a dangerous combination. if im irritated i tend to take it out on other people so they dont want to be around me and then theres no one to cheer me up from being sad.  so i mope. i sit feeling lonely and thinking about y i feel lonely. 
its times like these when i think about ex girlfriends. y r they gone entirely from my life? im not an asshole, right?? i would love for amanda and i to be friends again. its screwed up that i feel this way because shes been really rude to me.  we were so close why dont we ever talk? i was thinking about these things on the way home from school. when i think about her its like i stumble into a programing error in my brain, an endless loop, and i feel like im crazy for even caring.  
when i got home from school i found a letter from her,well not really from her but from st. judes childrens hospital.  shes doing a fundraiser and wants me to donate. the letter made me happy like woohoo she thought of me. my god am i a dope. like her needing money from me is some sign that she thinks about me. im sending her a chck, i recognise that im being a sucker but at least this time its for a good cause."

""No the word you're thinking of is nympho a nymph is something different.""~Haney on Shakespeare.
""Think of katharsis as cleaning out your emotional small intestine""~Haney 
""cocaine is a girls drug real men use chrystal meth.""~guy in my calculus class
""like all things that are cool its dangerous""~savage

ahh yes its been a year to remember. 
but back to dreams ive been sleeping alot more(taking naps and stuff ) and lately ive been remembering my dreams when i wake up. its wierd i dont usually dream about people on television and if i do its usually a one time thing but the last few dreams ive had john kerry ahs been in. no they arent kinky dreams, you sicko. its like ill be at a relatives house with my family and he'll just be there and it will seem normal. he usually just makes a cameo. its very strange. 
im cool with it as long as he doesnt start messing with my megan dreams. ahh megan. when ur single those dreams become more important. id prefer having a good sensual dream to masturbation or porn any day. ok ive got to go i have stuff to do, ill do a better entry next time."

"event","all ive got to do is get my grandmothers marriage certificate and death certificate and come up  with the cash and im on my way to becoming a genuine irish citizen, more importantly a citizen of the EU. no im not turning my back on america but its always good to have a backup plan. especially when u realize how powerful the crazy christians in ur country are. god damn them. constitiutional amendment fuckers at least as a dual citizen i can get married in amsterdam.   
i got called by a recruiter yesterday this is the second time theyve called this month. 
they must really want me. maybe i have super killing powers that they are aware of but i havent discovered yet. thats probably it. i am the ultimate soldier i just dont know it yet. i alone have the super speed and sharpshooting ability and kung fu skills to eliminate worldwide terrorism.i am the key to singlehandedly destroying our enemys and bring about world peace. thats probably it. 
but anyways, the last time they called they wouldnt let me go. i told them i wasnt interested but the guy was so persistent that i hung up on him. after i did i felt really guilty like an ungrateful person who disrespects the army that protects them.  so this time i didnt want to hang up on him but i wanted a way out.  ""have you ever thought about joining the army?"" he asks, i have but it wasnt the right choice for me i say which is true.  when he asked well why not i thought of the best answer. ""it doesnt agree with my lifestyle, im a lesbian"" i say back and damn did he let me go right away.  now there was one time that i was glad being gay is percieved as wierd. i should start doing that to telemarketers. ""no im not interested in a new credit card im a lesbian!"" i dont think it would work the same.  
with bush back in the whitehouse i dont think the calls from recruiters will stop but at least i have the perfect answer. damn him. him and all his creepy christian shit soon im gonna have to pay to be able to listen to howard thanks to his conservative moral agenda.  he better make up for all this shit in tax cuts that satelite radio is expensive. if hes gonna take away my rights to make shithead midwest jesus lovers happy the least he can do is pay me. yeah now im just rambling because im upset. i dont usually talk politics cause i know i dont have a really strong understanding of whats going on besides its impossible to look at things in politics for what they are everything is so baised and its soo easy to screw around with numbers. i got into the election like it was a sport. all the numbers and statistics are kind of like baseball. but in baseball if ur guys lose the world is still the same. in the election if ur guy loses u lose. u have to deal with the other guy being in charge.  i wanted kerry to win for his stance on gay rights,the war and free speech. besides im a registered democrat(thank u mal). i lost. but its only 4 years i gues and im young who knows maybe bush wont be a giant shithead."

"event","yesterday i had some halloween fun, ghosts and graveyards tour then a get together at laura bs place.  the whole sleezy 70s guy costume worked better than i thought. laura found the perfect pants and now mallory wants them.  the tour was cool and it taught me that the puritains were a really creepy group of people. sometimes i think the fundamentalists today are creepy but the puritains were the ultimate creepy christians. it was really nice of laura to have us all over after the tour. she had candy and vodka punch :D.  it was all a really good time.  good craic.  but since i spent all of saturday out and getting my costume ready to go out i didnt have a chance to do any studying or reading.  so today i get to stay home and get all caught up.
its funny how everything can be going well life can be good u can have hobbies and friends and lots of different things that make you really happy but u still feel pain because u miss being in love.  before i just missed sex and i thought of love as something stupid that causes you to allow urself to get fucked over. i am upset about how things have ended with the girls ive dated. i feel like i always give more then i should and get left in the end.  the two girls ive been with were both really important to me and now theyve both almost entirely disappeared from my life. to me they exist only in thier profiles on aim. im not the type of person that gets to know alot of people so the ones i get close are important to me. i dont understand why this is how things have to be and it sucks. 
and thru all this i dont think ive learned anything. im still a total sucker for a pretty girl even when i kno i have no chance with them. at work im always really careful when i cash out a draw because i kno if i fuck up megan has to fix it also i band every five twenties which is annoying as hell but i kno thats how she likes it. i gues it makes me a better worker but i kno if mike asked me to do it id do it for a week then slack off. its just being in the presence of a girl i like makes me happy and i have a really imature way of dealing with it. ill use megan as another example because i know megan doesnt read my journal. im usually pretty quiet but i warm up to people after im around them alittle and ive worked with her for a year and a half and im still obscenely shy with her.  wow this rant went in a direction i didnt plan on its turning into me talking about my super hott boss when i really wanted to talk about how i miss having a girlfriend even tho i always end up burned.  but i think im a better person when im single that little bit of sadness makes me more interesting and angsty. angsty/horny/frustated is always more interesting than content and in love especailly when in love just ends up being crap."

"event","hm never did finish that last entry, ohh well. i just saw i heart huckabees with laura and that was some wierd shit. the whole philosophical side of it was very interesting and it made the movie even wierder for me because laura and i were talking about that same stuff before we got into the theater. sweatshops, problems in africa, socialism, the hypocrisy of christianity and how we relate to other people. we even talked about how groups break apart and form conflicting factions( thats what i predict will happen to the GSA at her school because there are two different groups of people who feel responsible for forming it, also very much like the movie). and this, what we talked about being essential to what the movie was about, is all one big coincidence and one of the big things in the movie was a coincidence the main character wanted to figure out. freaky shit. at this point my aunt judy would say ""uncle peter"". its something the relatives on my dads side say whenever something strange and coincidental happens because my my great uncle was schizophranic and when ur schizophrenic you become convinced that the patterns and coincidences that just happen actually mean something. it was the perfect movie for the moment. 
it was good to spend some time with laura too. i havent seen her much lately. we r gonna hang out again tomorow gonna go to salvation army and look for stuff for my costume.  i think for my halloween costume ill just dress in drag. ill be a sleezy 70's guy. i think itll be really cool. at first i thought it would be stupid because i kno my dad will goof on me for it and itll be like surprise(sarcasm) lesbain girl dresses like dude.i couldnt think of anything else to be and itll be fun, ill be just like Peaches.  theres soo much more to write, like the fun time i had at laura(different laura)s show and stuff at work like mikes one legged dog and alvaros new baby and megan ahh yes megan but theres no time i need sleep or else ill be a zombie like i was this morning and that wouldnt be cool unless i found a way to turn that into a costume. who needs haloween makeup when u have bags under your eyes? yes but i have to go im sorry if this doesnt make sense i need sleep. the computer says its 10;46 but i kno its later than that.  good night."

"event","yeah what a night. according to the clock on my computer its 10:42 but im pretty sure its much later than that.  tonight i went out with kelly and jeanette and a bunch of other people to freidns to celebrate margots birthday. it was fitting that kelly and i found an old packman game in the bar to play because kelly and i have been playing videogames alot lately. (im sorry if this entry doesnt make alot of sense, i am still alittle tipsy).  anyways yesterday kelly and i finished resident evil 2 and now we r trying to figure out what should be our next project.
earlier today i had dinner with some relatives who were in the area to visit my cousins school. they had a big political discussion which i enjoyed because most of the family on my moms side is for kerry. yeah but im finally starting to get tired so i should get ot bed. ill write again tomorow, the important thing is that i had a good time tonight. if it happened in ireland i would definetly say it was good craic."

"event","this week has actually been alright but yeah i got outta school early today and we have aims testing this week ah man i hate aims so much! 

wake up and waste a day
chase away
a day at a time
and waste away
clean-faced today
clean taste today
toothpaste makes my
orange juice sour
waste a hour
or so
my shower
is slow
the flowers
that grow 
outside of my window
are blooming
I'm assuming 
that you're coming over soon
it's almost half past four
and you called here at noon
'cause there's a picture
that you wanna see
now I'm not even good at
being me
anymore

she got nicotine-pasted 
lungs
wasted thumbs
and one of them asphalt
tastin' tongues
she wakes up
to alarm
her make-up
is still on
and she can't remember
why she set the damn thing
her heart is a machine
art is meant to be seen
not felt
not heard
it's just paint
they're just words
and fingers are for feeling
fists are for beating 
scabs are for healing
and blood is for bleeding
that just how
I used to be
but I'm not even good at 
being me
anymore

I wake up and waste an hour
pace and glower
at the TV set wasting power
and the aching in my head
I'm baking in the red
and compulsively charging cd's to my account


so come out Jenny
its getting late
you Jersey girls like to make boys wait

now it's too late
in the day
for a matinee
and I ain't got the
money to pay
for you anyway
what should I say?
I know it ain't how it
used to be
but I'm not good
at being me
anymore"

Gavi and i went to the upstairs 7th grade building and we had to grade some of mrs.boyers papers and on the wall it said ""7A has good character"" or something like that and i cracked up cause all of the seventh graders upstairs were being jerks to us.  They kept kicking our papers and crap like that.  then we had a talk about buisness day then went to lunch (finally) we found out that leannas been talking crap about us lol thats a suprise (joke) then we went to band and robert left early then we went to an auction in peckins class and my dad picked me up early cause i asked him to and it was friekin awsome so now im here listening to music lol how fun ill probably make another entry later but im just bored right now later"

Where I almost made out with the Homecoming Queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut, with much bigger breastes
I almost dropped out to move to LA
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wished you would've loved me too

I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
Cause I almost got bopped for a fight with a thug
Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it

You kept me guessin' and now I'm destined
I've spent my time missing you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

Here I go, thinking 'bout all the things I could've done
I'm gonna need a forklift, cause all the baggage weighs a ton
(baggage weighs a ton)
I know we've had our problems, I can't remember one

I almost forgot to say something else
So if I can't fit it in, I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and I threw it away

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it

You kept me guessin' and now I'm destined
To spent my time missing you
And I almost had you (almost had you)
Almost had you

I almost wish you would've loved me too"

I was at camerons talking to his neighbor so then i looked on my cell phone and it said that annie had called i called her and her mom said she went to my house so i went over to a quarner near my house and called my dad and he said they told her to go to the house we were at so i scootered over there as fast as i could (i fell three times) and i finally saw her it was a wild goose chase... anyway cameron was gone and annie and i went to her house and her mom got us McDonalds!  We played video games for like 2 or 3 hours then kristen and jennifer came over and took us to ice cream and it was funny as hell!  annie ordered a chocalate milkshake but kristen was like ""we dont get milkshakes we get cones"" so then annie was like ""fine then a vanilla cone"" and kristen said ""why would u want a chocalate milkshake but a vanilla cone"" and annie said ""oh i dont know"" in the most confused was ever.  but yeah i called my mom when we were in the car and i was like ""kristen and jennifer took us to ice cream but its more like a kidnapping"" because kristen called annies brother chris and kyle picked up and she said she wasnt going to return us until they watched a movie with us so when i was on the phone with my mom kristen was yelling ""no talking in the backseat! but that apple back in ur mouth!"" and my mom got confused and hung up on me lol but yeah yesterday was pretty funny i got maria this i luv u wrist band cause shes awsome!  im probably gonnna hang out with her and allison today and tommorow maria allison and i are seeing hitch cause we're just cool like that

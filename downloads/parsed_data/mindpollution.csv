yeah, this username was better, but i felt like the journal was litterally polluted.  so i got a paid account with the_fallout which means i'm required to keep that journal for a year.  so don't worry, no more changes!

add me and i'll add you back."

"event","the past few days have been so weird for me.
i've been depressed, but happy.  ""sane but overwhelmed"".
on sunday i'm returning home for the first time in a few weeks, and i'm so nervous about it.  my dad didn't get any better since i've been gone, only worse, i don't know how i'm going to deal with that.
i just hope james is there to get me through it.

james isn't here right now, but he's supposed to be.

today at noon i'm going on a vacation, on a vacation.  my aunt and cousin are taking me up near rochester and then on saturday or sunday i'll be home in binghamton.
i won't be around much the next few days, which sucks cause i'll have james-withdrawal symptoms.
symptoms that come from being without someone i rely on to get me through my days.

i love you."

"event","the alanis concert was yummy except for the opening act.  it was res and the most exciting part of her set was when the band got toliet-papered.
after the concert i got an 'under rug swept' tour shirt, just for memories, and i'm wearing it today.  it's tight and pretty.
my dorkiness snuck a digital camera into the amphitheater, by telling the security guard that it was a pair of binoculars.  yes, i know i rock.  i took video clips of my favourite songs.

soon i might go see 'spiderman' for the second time.  
that movie was so bitching.

i'm so worried about my heart."

"event","Countdown to Alanis Morissette is six hours.
(well, if damn rock concerts started on time)
I wonder who is opening for her, Ticketmaster insists on not revealing this information.

After the concert, we're all having a sleepover and watching some Madonna video.  I wanted to keep Hayden in 'Life As A House' but he was due back at Blockbuster today.

I am going to enjoy tonight muchly.
Minus the fact that James isn't going to the concert.
It will feel like an empty void without him.

Everybody who hasn't heard Tinfed, download 'Way Thru'."

"event","it's scary that four years ended in what seemed like a few seconds.
but, i never ever have to go back to that horrid place called high school again, and it feels absolutely wonderful.  sure, i'll miss things like lunches with yogi, tarik and siury.  but i'm still glad it's over.

after graduation my cousin took me to the palisades mall.  i went to best buy and bought three cds: the weakerthans - fallow, garbage - garbage, and depeche mode - black celebration.
the stupid buggers won't have bright eyes in until monday, so i might have to reside to borders.

the weakerthans cd booklet smells yummy. mm."

"event","my graduation is in less than an hour.
i'm in boxers, a t-shirt, my teeth aren't brushed, my hair is a mess, and it takes twenty-five minutes to get to the school.
let me emphasize this: <b>OH SHIT</b>!

oh yeah, happy birthday kat."

"event","today i observed that the tired emoticons under this mood theme look more like head-givers than yawners.

i woke up today and i felt like i wasn't here.
i hate questioning, <i>""do i really exist?""</i>
it's so strange to come out of sleep, feeling like an illusion.

i'm supposed to invite yogi to the alanis morisette concert on sunday but i'm nervous about calling him.  attack of social anxiety again.
it's just that i'll feel stupid if he can't go.  or if he doesn't want to.

tell me, why do sandwiches have to be so filling?
thanks to tuna fish, i feel like i'm going to spontaneously explode."

exams are over.  what a relief.
and, all my free time has allowed me to determine that the woodstock 94 cd kicks ass, and everybody lacking it is DEPRIVED.
that means everyone should go buy it, to prevent this deprived-ness.
yes, yes.

in a pathetic attempt to get free phone cards, i ended up just getting tons of junk mail.
compuserve, why don't you filter spam?  lazy bastard.

i wish metallica would stop cursing.
not that i have anything against it.
it's just <strike>going</strike> gone to my head."

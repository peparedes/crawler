"event","does anyone else think that jessica simpson should die. and not just die but be brutally murdered. i mean seriously this girl has ruined more songs with her horrible non-singing ass. lets make a list off the songs shes ruined so far
<center> take my breath away
angels
she took the background music from that one john mellencamp song... oh and it sucked 
and most recently... these boots are made for walkin.

and i wont even mention the numerous christmas songs she murdered.</center>

so yeah i hate her. my new musical obsession has been bright eyes lately. ive always liked him but now im in the phase where i listen to him all the time and i listen to a few songs several times a day. oh and i also have a secret obsession. i <b> absolutely love</b> the phantom planet song, california. i hate the o.c. with all my heart, but i really love this song. and i have really been into this one song off the new white stripes cd, as ugly as i seem. it really is awesome and the sound is great. 

not much else is going on. ive been feeling sick like everyday, which sucks.... my last day at subway is next wednesday. caleb gets back this sunday.we leave next friday for rome. hopefully i get sick before then cause i do not want whatever this is to go full blast when my mom isnt around. i know how that sounds... but come one total strangers... and caleb. i usually take care of myself anyway but its just nice when my mom checks in on me and stuff. yeah. i got my guitar out the other day... its been awhile, but she still looks as beautiful as ever. i looked up the tabs for jolene and hypnotize so i think i might try one out. well see. ok well i gotta go. later."

"event","its been feeling like summer again. it doesnt hurt so much that caleb is away. i guess just the first week is the worst, but now im used to not being able to talk with him. so yeah things have been fun. ive been partying. or at least hanging out. its been a lot of fun. it reminds me of the good ol days when sara and i hung out all the time. those were seriously the best times of my life. it was so awesome cause i was just starting to really figure out who i am and we just had the best time and talked about everything. and you really know that someones your best friend when you can piss on yourself in front of them.either because your drunk ... or you cant hold it at a strokes concert.lol. yeah i heard that bryan adams song the other day, summer of 69, and it reminded me of those times."

"event","ok since its been forever and im actually in the mood i figured that id update this. ok so first off... new layout. <center> i hate photobucket</center> i couldnt get my picture as big as it was cause photobucket automatically resizes your pics.. which completely sucks. but anywho.. back to updating

we must go back all the way to april 17th. caleb and i and mr. smeeth take a driving trip to koln,germany to see a little band known as <i> the arcade fire</i>. the opening band was final fantasy.. and the best ever. it was the violin guy (owen pallet) from arcade fire, but it was a seperate one-man band. it was seriously the all time master. it was just him and his violin. he had a pedal that he used to record and he would make layers with the music and sing. it was the all time master, i love him. oh and i think he shall be my new husband. arcade fire was <b> the best live band i have ever seen</b>. seriously. i went to this concert honestly not expecting much at all. but it was so amazing. well the place that it was at was just this little venue, smaller than what a bar would be, so that was nice. and we were very close to the stage. the show was amazing and very intense, every single person was rocking as hard as they could and it was just so amazing to see. and every person (except for the violin people) played at least three different instruments during the show. there were all kinds of instruments being played. yes, definately the best live show/band ever. towards the end of the concert the lead guy, i have no clue what his name is, but you know who im talking about. yeah so he gets off the stage and walks throught the audience to the back of the room and then back to the stage. it was the best and of course he walked right next to where caleb and i were, but caleb was on the outside so he touched him. and not me. so yeah. it was awesome

ok and schools out. but this year is coming fast. and it will be busy too. i was elected student council president. im so excited. ive wanted to do this since freshman year. but we have homecoming soon and this year we have split lunches so im going to have to work around those setbacks. which sucks. 

all ive done the summer is mostly work. ugh it sucks. but my last day is the 3rd of aug. then to rome with caleb's family. i quit so i can focus on school and do more volunteer work. im going to sign up for the boys and girls club. and they give scholarships out.. which rocks. and i will also have a whole month before school starts to spend with caleb and make up for lost time. i miss him so much. i think about him like every second of every day. i love him and i cant wait till he gets home. 

ok so i think i covered all areas of my life. later"

<center> I won't mistake you for problems with me
I won't let my moods ruin this, you'll see
I won't take everything good adn move it away
I won't be left dancing alone to songs from the past
would you stay home and keep our memories warm with me
would you give all your love for a run at the past with me
I know you're sad even though you say that you're not
I know you're scared even though you say that you're not
I won't get mad when you say things are getting too hard
I won't make all of your love so scared to come through our yard
I won't scream in my head and let it isolate me
I won't be left dancing alone to songs from the past.</center>"

"event","its been awhile since ive updated, and i know i havent emailed anyone in forever. so yeah this week was ap exams week. aplac was a piece of cake. apus.. not far behind. it was a little stressful cause i know that ap chem is looming around the corner. so yeah. busy week. then this morning i had to rise at 5:30 again to make it to ktown for the SAT. not to bad, except the test now is 3hrs adn like 45 min. the procter didnt have their shit together, so we started late. like an hour late so we didnt get done til almost 2. then i came home and went braindead for a few hours. i called jamie. we were supposed to go to a movie tonight so i called him to see what time and he said that he was having some guys spend the night at his house and they were thinkin about battle of the bands. he said theyd be on base all night. so i was like ok he said he didnt know his cell number to give to me so he said hed call me when he got off at 6. so 7 rolls around and jamie's faggot ass still hasnt called so im just like whatever ill go and maybe ill see him adn if not ill just see whose there. get there and no jamie. i already paid 5 bucks so i just decided that i might as well stay. found lindsey manley and hung out with her. this was the worst showing ive ever seen. seriously no one was there and it might as well have been called the brian stevenson show cause he was in all 3 bands. and 2 out of the 3 bands were fuckin shit metal. although i slightly enjoyed the second. mostly we just made fun of people and took smoke breaks. well mine was second-hand. trust me i wanted one but i was too embarassed to bum. so yeah. speaking of which,court its been almost a year since my last one. trust me it has been hard and i dont think it will last much longer. not that thats good. anywho. after i left i called caleb and talked for a bit. then i headed over to the shopette and bought my madre some flowers. it was nice. i actually spent money on her this year. 

oh yes i almost forgot. in addition to ap exams ive also had a shitty week at work. new boss is there adn wants to change everything but doesnt know what the fuck hes doing. i hate him; i love subway and he made me hate it. am seriously considering finding a new job. my parents offered me a chance to stay at home with jessica and shelbi over the summer, but staying home all summer= fat allison. so yeah, no es bueno. i might transfer to landstuhl, but its hard. i dont think ill be able to get a job because my dad is like ""youre not working past six"" which i know i couldnt handle doing homework after working til nine. but i dont know. maybe to like 7 or8. i dont know but im still thinking about it. i looked up the coffee shop in the bx. they have an opening but its for a part time job. i dont know what ill do. ok well im off now. am tired."

"event","ok its been forever and a day since i updated. ive been busy adn a little lazy. so lets start with the saturday after i last updated. when i was going to work and backed out of the driveway i pulled into the driveway behind us too close to the fence adn ended up hitting it. it was just a little, so turned the wheel all the way in the other direction, but i pulled out at normal speed so i dented the van. i have to pay a 500 dollar deductible. im almost done cause i paid with my taxes adn prom adn sat money. so yeah. went to euro disney and paris. it was fun. i love disney. i really enjoyed it. paris was alright. i ate a tuna sandwich at the eifel tower, but i was having a heart attack cause all these fuckin pidgeons were surrounding us adn i have this intense fear of pidgeons. my dad threw a fry right next to my feet so they would come over to me and i was pissed and he wa like ""oh... i was trying to get it on your lap"" i seriously would have died and/or shat myself. the city was cool.it jsut didnt have the same essence as italy or london, you know? we didnt get to do much shopping cause we came back the next day to go to the louvre and the only shops around there were tourist shops. i saw the louis vuitton store and it was awesome. i never saw the h&m though, i just kept seeing people with bags. so yeah. i got caleb a purple paris baret. my plan was to give it to him adn be like ""isnt it great, i knew youd love it.. try it on"" but i started laughing a little bit. but he liked his light saber. lol. and his family liked the glasses i got for them. which is good. this past weekend caleb came over and we hung out. it was great fun. i also got invited to go study at cambridge college (yes the one in england) for 2 weeks this summer. i really want to go more than anything. but its almost 6000 dollars so i dont know. theres no way we can afford it, but my dad talked to his squadron and some other places, adn he said that if we can ger half the money i can go. i tried to talk to my counselor and also my career counselor, but they are both out, i think for the whole week. that sucks. but i want to go more than anything. it would be so amazing. but i can understand if i cant go cause were going to the states this summer to look at colleges. so thats cool. ap exams are coming up. next week i will probably we crying and pulling my hair out. actually im not too worried about my ap chem exam cause i know that im not going to do good. i feel pretty good about apus adn aplac, so i just need to study some. so yeah. thats whats going on.... i have no homework, thats why i was able to update adn i plan to be a good girl and try to start my history paper. he gave it to us like a month ago and its due may3. so yeah im gonna try to do it. later.

"event","well today has been a wonderful birthday. i got up early to go take my drivers test. i failed. i missed it by two, but make up days are on friday so im going back tomorrow. but i had to rush back to catch my cp bus. then at my job site i got to package pills instead of doing birth control the whole time. it was cool then i come back. the bus was late so i dash to my locker so i can go to aplac. when i open it, caleb had taped garden state to the back of my locker adn put my card in there. it was the best i was so happy. i read his card and the card his mom got me. it was nice. i read his card like 3 times in aplac. i love him so much. so yeah then i go to lunch and tell him thanks and i love you adn all that jazz. then we go to seminar and all the juniors had to make course selections. so yeah. then my dad checks me out cause i have to go sign for my passport. we are halfway to the street adn he hands me a fancy box, one that like a very expensive necklace or bracelet would go in so i set my stuff down cause i realize that he has the camera out. so i open it up only to find... <b> the key to the audi!</b> yep, its mine. awesome. so yeah then i run out and theres a balloon hangin from windsheild wipers and a bow on top of the car. <big> heck yes.</big> i was so excited. ( and i didnt really need to get my passport, Jason was tricking me) if i had passed i would have driven home. but oh well. that car is mine now and im so excited. so i want to decorate it and everything. it might be a week or two before i drive it cause i still am not 100% with a stick. but i was so excited. then we come home and the house is dark adn i come in adn see my cake with the candles lit and my mom jessie and shelb jump out. it was cool. so i blow out my candles and open my presents. shelbi got me this lovely little silver rose bracelet, jessica got me a hair straightener (i asked for it), and my parents got me some vera wang perfume (that i asked for also). so yeah it was cool and shelbi helped me put on the bracelet adn then my dad comes out adn hands me a laptop. i was shocked. so yes. this birthday has been awesome. im so happy and excited about all the things i got. this has been the best ever. 
on saturday caleb, my family, and i are going to dinner then back to la casa and caleb and i will hang out. his mom got <i> the grudge</i> and <i> saw</i> so that is cool i cant wait. i have to work on saturday but i get off at 11. so it will be fun. i may go get my cartiliage pierced, but probably not. ok well gotta finish la tarea. 
later

oh yeah and on my card that shelbi made me it was so thoughtful but i was crackin up cause she told me that she wanted all my birthday wishes to come true and that she was going to help make them come true. i was crackin up cause it reminded me of a little Pedro <i><center> ...and if you vote for me, all your wildest dreams will come true</i></center>"

"event","ok i know its been a while. i have pics of the concert and amazing stories to tell, but i dont have time right now. im writing right now cause my parents and i just got into the hugest fight. we were talking about spring break and i guess were going to paris and so i asked if we were going to go anywhere else during the summer, cause weve been here 5 years and have not gone many places, all i was saying was that you know we live in europe and we have an opportunity so why not take it. so then my dad was asking me when i was planning to do it during this summer since i was doing other stuff this summer. adn then we got into my summer plans and then my dad was like i told you there was no way you were going to new york with caleb this summer. and i started crying like mad. i was ballin. i know for a fact that he never said that casue if he had i wouldnt have gotten my hopes up. and last week i told them that i really wanted to go with caleb to see his family so i might jsut tell my maw maw that i wasnt going to work at the hospital. and no one said that i couldnt go. i didnt hear about this at all. i know that a few weeks ago i was talking to my dad in the car and he was like well i dont want you to go anywhere that you dont have family near by and all that and i told him that we werent talking about college, that i was talking about a trip. so now my parents are making make and itinerary of my summer, what i want to do when  and how im going to pay for it. so i emailed eric asking if they have an opening at the bowling alley. im testing for my liscence on thursday so i should be driving soon and i can work two jobs. its not so much about going now, its more about proving to my parents that im not a fuckin idiot like they think. i dont know why either cause im alot better and i dont know they just fuckin piss me off. ugh."

fuck you, for trying to manipulate and use me.

37 +- 1 or 2 days until Indy.&nbsp; I can't wait.

Apparently I don't have to take Physics208 this summer after all...so moving away for the summer could still be a possibility after all.&nbsp; I don't think I can afford it, nor do I know what that would do for my living situation here.. but how awesome would it be to get the fuck out of North Carolina for 3 months.

Now, to write a 5 page history paper before 6pm tomorrow....

"event","I have developed a sudden urge to write.  To be creative . To be original.  To be artistic.  To be productive.  The more I think about it, the more excited I get about switching majors.  I feel like it is a much needed fresh start for me after all that has happened in the past year.

My life is nothing like I had envisioned it would be at this point.  I can't say that I am dissapointed with that either.  For the very first time in my life, I am living for me.  While I have a long way to go, the important thing is I feel like I am moving in the direction of being the person I want to be.  So much has changed over the past year.  So much has changed in the past two months.  Change is something I never used to feel comfortable with...at all.  However, it's something I am learning to appreciate.

I feel like I have grown up a lot in the past year.  And again, even moreso in the past two months.  I also feel like I have alot of growing up left to do.  It is really amazing to think about how much of a life changing experience going to college is.  The direction my life is currently moving is so far off track from what I imagined I always wanted.  Thank you college.  No really, thank you.  I feel perfectly fine with that.  With the decisions I have made lately, I am excited about my future.  I no longer have it all planned out.  I have a general goal and direction as far as my education and career is concerned, but in general I do not have a ""life plan"" which I always had growing up.  While I do believe it is important to keep your future in mind, I have learned through experience that having a plan more often than not will lead to disappointment and will rarely be followed through as intended.  It all goes back to the fact that things change.  That's what makes life interesting..

I am thankful for the new perspective I have recently obtained on life."

"event","i love not being in class today.  i say that like i went yesterday, but it feels nice to not be in class and not know in the back of your mind the reason being is that you are skipping it.  i'm sitting in cup-a-joe right now (which has a really fucking awesome chai tea drink) doing some contract work for my old job.  my aunt emailed me this week and said she has taken over the position of director for the health sciences academy and has asked me to come back to help them out with the website again.  so hopefully i can do that and make some quick cash to maybe go to new york on new years! :)  but it's doubtful..i don't have the money saved up already and i know my parents won't give it to me..that trip idea was too spontaneous.

the more i think about it the more i like the idea of switching majors to communication media.  i plan on minoring in journalism if so.  i would really love to transfer to photography school somewhere, but that's just not possible right now.  i think that my best bet as of now is to continue school with com. media, do some internships and whatnot, and use it to get a job after college.  then i can put myself through a photography program somewhere if that's what i still want to do.  i feel that if i can just find a mentor here in raleigh to work under for the next few years as i'm in school then i would learn more than i would in a school anyway.  i would love to find someone to help out in their studio doing anything really for a few hours a week..most of what i know of photography right now i credit to my mentor from my senior project in high school.

jason and i are going to take some sunset pics tonight on this place he found off of edwards mill rd. that is really awesome.  myles suggested we do a shoot off with him and one other model at two different locations..which sounds like it could be pretty fun.  i'm also gonna do another shoot with meagan as soon as we both get some free time and same with jeffrey.  the state fair will be here tomorrow for the next week which we also plan on shooting.  brandon also wants me to take some pics of him.  so much stuff to shoot coming up, i'm exited. :)"

"event","i'm sitting in port city java in greenville right now, trying to write the code for my csc216 programming project that is due on tuesday.&nbsp; i should be excited to work on that project considering it's a class directly related to my major -- but i'm not.&nbsp; and i'm really not sure why either.&nbsp; this semester has gone to shit already and i haven't had anything major due yet.&nbsp; but i will get plenty of that this week.&nbsp; let's see why my schedule looks like for the first half of this week:

Monday:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calc 3 test (which will be bad, bad news..)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrete Math for CSC Homework 3 Due - shouldn't be too bad if i can find the time between studying to work on it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physics webassign due - those always suck.

Tuesday:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java 2 - Programming project 1 due (big project, that is sure to cause lot's of stress between now and then)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physics prelab due
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  ** but tuesday night = awesome =&gt; nip/tuck party at my place with meghan josh chris and sarah.&nbsp; and that means i will have to talk jeffrey into coming too if meghan hasn't already.

Wednesday:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physics test
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrete math test
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 tests + 3 other classes, one of which is a 2 hour physics lab at night.

Basically, that shit sucks.&nbsp; I love how each professor thinks their class is most important, and all of them plan to give tests this week because it's the week before the drop deadline or something.

I have totally lost my motivation and I don't know what to do to get it back.&nbsp; I'm hoping that after this week is over, next weekend will be fun and relaxing and things will start to get better.&nbsp; I have no doubt that I will most likely bomb most of these assignments/exams this week, but I'm going to try to manage my time better next week after these things are out of the way.&nbsp; If not, I do not know what will happen.. I really really wish I had started college at wake tech and transferred over this year or next..in the long run i think that it would have been cheaper and better for me.&nbsp; I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my parents' money on school right now&nbsp; Maybe I just need some adderol or something.&nbsp; I think that I worked so hard in high school for so long that it just burnt me out.&nbsp; Not only that but as i have grown up some over the past year, some things that back then i saw in my future and were important to me are of less&nbsp; importance.&nbsp; And now I'm just rambling so I'm going to get back to work."

"event","hate school.<br /><br />alot.<br /><br />
<div text=""also, i found this amusing."" class=""ljcut"">""Dear President Bush,<br /><br />Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have learned a great deal from you and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Laws and how to follow them:<br /><br />1. Leviticus 25:44 states that I may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not to Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?<br /><br />2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br /><br />3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br /><br />4. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br />5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states that he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself, or should I ask the police to do it?<br /><br />6. A friend of mine feels that, even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there ""degrees"" of abomination?<br /><br />7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?<br /><br />8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?<br /><br />9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br /><br />10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them (Lev. 24:10-16)? Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws (Lev. 20:14)?<br /><br />I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help.<br /><br />Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.""</div>"

i overslept and missed class.

it took me 30 minutes to get to work this morning when i live 5 minutes away thanks to road work and construction on and off campus.&nbsp; my campus looks like a war zone currently.

all the parking spots were full when i finally got to work and i don't have a campus parking pass to park anywhere else on campus.&nbsp; so i had to go get a vistor's pass illegally upstairs.

when i got downstairs and turned my car on the battery light was on.&nbsp; that battery is only a year old.&nbsp; went to advanced auto parts to get it tested and they said i need a new alternator..so there goes another $200 i have to pay next week.&nbsp;&nbsp; that totals it to over $800 that i have to pay next week between tuition and car repairs.&nbsp; fucking great.&nbsp; i was already broke.&nbsp; i get paid on friday so i'll pay my tuition late and have absolutely no money left.

"event","this time of year -- and life -- brings with it a lot of transition in many ways.  i am in the process of transitioning to greenville for a week and a half or so, and then moving into my summer apartment in raleigh.  less than week after that i will start summer session and full-time work.  i have just finished the second semester of my freshman year [which has turned out to be a nightmare].  in only 3 months i will be moving again, to another apartment in raleigh.

being in college, i have discovered you go through other types of transitions as well.  being exposed to many new ideas, experiences, lifestyles, people, and environments all lead to mental transitions.  it is how you handle all of the different kinds of transitions that defines your future and the person you will become.  kind of scary to think about if sit back and look at the bigger picture of things.

although i've only been in college for one year i've already changed my outlook on a lot of things.  i'm sure in the next 3-4 years that process will continue to occur as i am faced with even more new things.  some things are easier to adjust to than other.  to say the least, i can say that i have a lot of work to do on various levels to become well-adjusted.

after looking over this post, i realize it is not the easiest to understand...but as meghan said, ""i have all these ideas and don't know how to put them into words.""



on a side note, i have many things i would like to accomplish this summer.  therefore i see it as a benefit to myself to start compiling a list.  so here's a few things for starters:

- retake CH101 successfully
- possibly retake MA241..successfully.  [although i pray that is not necessary]
- make new friends in raleigh
- train and shoot for the Technician
- start designing and developing an online photography portfolio for myself in freetime at the Technician
- work with Tanner on our raleigh photography community website
- work with Tanner on reorganizing our business and completing the website"

"event","as i was eating breakfast before my psychology exam this morning, it hit me.  i have decided to stay in raleigh this summer and for the most part i made that decision on my own (aside from me having to retake a class for summer school).  but as i was saying, it just hit me today that this summer would be nothing like the previous one at all..nor will it ever be that way again..and that saddens me to think about.  i saw my best friends literally almost every day last summer that i possibly could unless i or they were out of town.  i realized today that tanner won't be a phonecall away from hanging out, lq won't be a call away from going to lunch together on our lunchbreaks from work or going to get coffee every night or best buy or b&n etc.. christie wont be call away from all of the above, meghan wont' be there to go out and pick on people hahah, jeffrey won't be there to party (well he will be there technically but i'm sure i'll never see him), etc... even though i have been in raleigh all year with intentions of trying to stay here for the summer, it still saddens me.  and at the same time, i don't plan on going home every weekend and such either, unless people start visiting me..including my parents.  i'm really excited about the summer and my new roommates as they seem to be awesome and i'm sure we will have a lot of fun, but nothing will compare to last summer or those people who i miss dearly.  :-/"

<div style=""text-align: center;"">So what would you say if I told you,
We weren't so different after all?
And if I told you that I loved you,
Would you go hide behind that wall?

The radiator's banging
A strange rhythm in my ear,
And wisps of breath pouring out my lungs,
tell me never to fear.

I know you're out there sleeping,
curled up under your sheets,
If I asked if I could join you,
would you share with me all of your...heats?

Cuase I'm just dying to be with you,
And I know you're not that type of girl,
But I'll share with you all my secrets,
Maybe...I can make your slight legs curl.</div>

Alright, terrible, I'm sure.  But I'd love some feedback...anybody?"

"event","Last night my friend Ann took me to this african dance performance at Naropa, the alterternative-hippie university that's here in Boulder, then we went to this crazy after-party for it.  I knew nobody there except her, so it was kind of awkward since everyone was dancing and I'm too self-concious to dance most of the time.  But it was still fun and I met a whole bunch of people.  I ended up crashing at her house in one of her roomate's beds.  A pretty crazy night, overall.

I'm going home for Thanksgiving for about a week starting tomorrow, which should be fun and hopefully I'll have a chance to catch up with some old friends.

I've started dating Annie (different girl than above).  She's really awesome, creative, funny and wonderful to spend time with,and I like her a lot.  We see the world a little differently, but there is something about her that really amazes me...

That's about all from here.  Oh, and I bought Bruce Springsteen's <i> Born to Run </i> because I felt guilty being from New Jersey and not owning it.  As it turns out, its an increadable album.  

Also went to a show last week at the Fox; Minus the Bear (good) These Arms are Snakes(awesome!), Big Business (bizzare and stupid), and this local Denver band, The Photo Atlas, which you should all check out.

Peace, Love, and Happiness,
Andrew"

Like the morning dew
Still linger like us lovers
after the night is through

Remember when-
You told me your life story-
Start to...that moment in time...
You put it all down so that I would know everything-
Will I be just another line?  A few words?

Well, baby, I got to tell you,
In my life story,

There are volumes, Shelves,
With your name on it in gold, cursive print 
On the spines of every one.

And I wouldn't even have it any other way.

Someone once told me to burn all your pictures, your letters, your gifts to me.

But honey, I don't believe in burning books."

"event","So- Its about time I finally update this thing.  Things are going pretty well.  I'm starting to get into the groove at work, and my buddy Thomas started working today, which means I get to teach him how things run around there, and boss him around until he gets the jist of things.

Alas, as pathetic as it sounds, I have done more social activities in the past month due to my purchase of a cellular phone (and thus newfound contactability) than I have in the previous few months put together.  I've been to a bunch of cool concerts.  Everything from jam bands at Red Rocks to hardcore shows in Lo-Do (That's the sketchy-ish part of Denver).  I've also been getting to know this girl Annie whom I met at a concert a few months back really well.  We might date, or we might just stay friends, but either way its really nice to have someone outside of this wierd community that I'm a part of to talk to and relate to.  (Speaking of which, I'm trying to start the moving out proccess.  As far as I know right now, I'm planning on staying in Boulder.)

Oh!  I met my long-lost cousin the other day.  She came into the store I work at and was like ""Andrew Cohn?  Hi, I'm your cousin...Robyn Mate.  We havn't seen each other in probably over ten years but my mom told me to look you up when I was passing through Boulder.""  (Turns out she's taking a cross-country trip with her friends-- New Jersey to California.)  So we went out for dinner that night and watched the sun go down behind the mountains and had some amazing conversations.  The strangest part though, is how similar we are.  She's a few years older than me (she's 23) and she had very similar experiences growing up.  We feel the same way towards our families and well, towards just about everything else.  Its like we've been living parallel lives all these years and never knew it.  Its crazy, and somehow I think it was very important that I meet her and talk to her about what's going in my life.  She had lots of good advice and kind words for me.  She's back on the road, but brought me lunch the next day at work and wrote me a beautiful note that she gave me before she left.  It nearly brought me to tears.  She was so generous, she gave me her friends phone number who lives in Boulder, who might help me find an apartment, and she even gave me an open invitation to go stay with her in New Jersey, the only condition being that I take a class while I live with her."

I want everything to just stop because I just forget trying to make anything out of myself.  I can't handle anything anymore.  This is beyond Elizabeth, beyond school, beyond work, beyond moving out.  Beyond all this bullshit that I've piled up in my life.  I want to take so many pills I can't see straight.  I want to be done.  I want it to stop.  I wasn't cut out to live.  I shouldn't be, and I should just stop trying to fight everything.  The days have been bad for so long I can't remember.  And there's just no end in sight.  No matter what I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and I'm so so tired of trying to find it and failing.  I've said it for years but if my life got a grade it would be an F.  And I have no intention of studying for the next exam.  Its just too much work.  I'm lazy and I don't feel like worrying and sweating and griping and bitching and moaning and crying every single day.  I don't feel like smiling or laughing either.  I don't feel like being.  When are things going to get better?  I just want to be babied so I don't have to care about life anymore.  I want to go back to the hospital and stay there forever, where I'm safe and cared for and don't have anything to worry about."

plastic phallus that the lead singer is wearing.&nbsp; At the end of

"event","Life is just so messy right now.  I have no direction, no idea where I'm headed at the moment.  If things stay the way they are right now, even if I get into college, there's no way that I could succeed there.  I guess I have to step things up but I really don't want to. Another thing that bothers me is that if I were to simply get a job and live on my own, I'd be all alone.  I'd find it really hard to make friends without a common activity such as school, or a common living space such as a dorm.  I feel like I would be really alone an miserable.  I wish there was a way where I could just make everything right and fix all the things I've messed up.  I don't know what to do, but somehow I fear that I'm headed for disaster.  I'm sort of curious what it would be like to be sort of a vagabond.  Sort of wandering around with no real purpose.  Hitchhiking and so forth.  I think my problem is is that no matter what I could possibly make my future.  Whether it would be work right away or college or whatever it may be, I cannot see myself being happy.  I cannot envision which path would be the rewarding for me.

sorry for the lame entry.  I havn't updated in a while.  This update was really bad and uniformative too."

"event","Walking down street last night at 2 in the morning brings strange thoughts.  I watched a young man throw concrete blocks from a nearby garden in the middle of the street, shattering and sending rubble sliding down the sloped road.   I saw people whooping and hollering in Saturday Night joy; and I heard murmurs of conflict.  An upset young woman crying on the shoulder of a young man.  The street lights casting their empty light on the ground in this paradise.  Whats going on around me I don't even know.  Such confusion.  Why do we do this to ourselves?  I feel the tension around me.  I feel the burn of chemicals, of urges, of wants and needs.  Nicotine and Caffiene and Alcohol.  And Estrogen and Testosterone.  And who knows what the fuck else.  People struggling like atoms fighting for space.  Bonds broken and created.  My dim understanding matches the dim flames of cigarrettes.  Take the smoke in and feel the pressure in your lungs.  Fuck all this.  Forget this life.  Act in; Act out; Don't act.  So much pain we inherit and breed.

Where am I going with all this?"

Okay so I did this and immediatly tried this chord out on my guitar.  Works pretty well for me.  By the way,(Elizabeth) this chord is in <i> Alison. </i>

"event","So, I don't update this very often anymore.  Got a problem with that, buddy?  Huh? Huh?  That's what I thought.  

The best news lately is that I got an awesome deal on a gently used pair of skis (with kick-ass bindings) along with boots. I went out Friday and today and I had a blast.  I had the skis sharpened and waxed last night and they're really zipping along quite nicely.  Skiing, by the way, (if you didn't know this about me) is one of the only things I am really pretty good at.  Nobody except this one kid, Ben, can keep up with me.  Once he gets his skis tuned up he'll definatly beat me down the hill, and with much greater form, but I like a little competion now and again.

In 10 days (the 14th) I get to come home again, and I'm very excited.  I insisted on a long vacation this time around, so I'm going to get it.  It should be fun.  I'm curious if anyone has any plans or ideas about New Years, because it would be wonderful to spend it with all the people I miss back home, and maybe some new people too.

That's about all from here.  Questions?  Comments?  You know what to do.

Peace, Love, Happiness,  ( I know, I know, its corny...)

I am definatly somewhat scary.  Not much going on really at the moment.  Its very late and I'm bored and I havn't updated in an extremely long time.  I finally get to come home soon and see Elizabeth who I miss so so so so so much!!  I'm so excited!!!!!  <3 <3 <3!!!   That's really all I'm thinking about.  I'm trying to do a bit more schoolwork which is good.  Other than that things are pretty quiet.  I don't really fit in so well here, but I'm dealing the best I can.  I'm kind of lonely but that's the way it goes I suppose.   I should probably write more but they'res really nothing else to say.  Mainly I'm just really excited to see Elizabeth!

It was increably  funny,  I was so impressed!  I don't really know what else to say.  I just miss Elizabeth.  I just need to see her so badly; she's everything to me.  
Brian, my friend from boarding school last year, is in town so we hung out yesterday, which was quite fun.  Hopefully I'll see him again before he leaves and he'll introduce me to some of his friends in Boulder so I'll have someone to hang out with.  Other than that things are pretty quiet.

She's so lovely.  -siiiighh- I love and miss her so much."

I hurt Elizabeth so badly unintentionally and I'm just such a jerk, thank God its all under control now and  everythings okay.  I love her so much, I couldn't bear to lose her."

"event","I saw a really messed up movie the other night -- <i> Eraserhead </i>.    It was crazy weird but very very good and artsy, which is the way I like things.  In a way, the movie was a warning about premarital sex, in other ways it was other things.  But it was awesome and amazingly well-done nonetheless.  

Don't really know what else to say.  Again, I don't really fit in here so well, but its okay because its certantly not the first time I havn't fit in somewhere.  John just went back to Woodhall, I havn't heard from him but I hope he's doing alright and surviving the best he can.

I miss Elizabeth a lot a lot.  She just got a solo in a play I'm super duper proud of her, I hope I will be home to see it!  I'm so amazingly grateful she's in my life right now, and it sucks so much that we have to be separated.  -sigh-

"event","Wellers here I am in Boulder, CO, writing cause I'm bored and also because I havn't updated since I've been here.  This place is okay.  There is even more freedom that I imagined.  If i wanted to I could stay out all night, and they won't stop you.  I can sleep all day, and they really can't/won't do anything about it.  But I won't do either of those things.  I really have to get my school stuff together.  Those are just things I could do.  Its interesting though.  I don't really fit in so well since many of kids.  Interest-wise I do but activity-wise not really so much.  Its cool if you listen to Led Zeppelin, but if you stay out all night every night drinking then I don't know if I'm really going to get along with you as well as I'd like.  I don't have a problem if people want to do those things, the way I see it, people have a right to choose what they want to do with their bodies and minds, and though they make a different choice than I do, who am I to stop them?
In the meantime, I miss my lovely Elizabeth so much.  Its going to be a very long couple of months away from her.  Luckily I have internet access here so we're able to talk on AIM and send e-mails and stuff.  Its so much better than last year where I had to struggle with people over control for the damn payphone in the dorm.

I'm going to try to make some friends now.  Maybe.  Maybe not.

Peace, Love, Happiness,

"event","Time for me to update this.  Elizabeth finally came back from babysitting at the Jewish summercamp after two long long weeks of waiting for her, we had a wonderful day yesterday, which was very special indeed...   :)

In other news, I'm leaving on Thursday for my new 'school', though its more like a program type deal than anything else.  Hopefully I'll be able to grow from the experience but I'm pretty worried about it.  I hope the other guys there are nice and will be friendly with me, but I'm sure, seeing how everyone's in the same boat and everything, there will be a fair amount of comradery between us.  Here's the website: (which in my opinion makes the place sound worse than it actually is, but maybe I just have no idea what I'm in for) http://www.aimhouse.com/  Take a look if you're interested and if you're not that's OK too.  I will still have my computer and internet access, so I'll be contactable (did I just make up a word)...as if anyone cares anyway.  But yeap, that's about it really.

This summer has been really really great in general.  I got job experience working at Alphagraphics (and I  may try to get a job working for one in Boulder if I get my act together), spent lots and lots of time with Elizabeth who I love so so so so so much, and spent lots of time with my friends who I missed a lot over the school year.

Anyway, wish me all luck because I'm sure I'll need it!!!

"event","I suppose it is time for me to update.  I went to go see that school in Colorado.  It looks okay I guess.  Its really hard to say.  I just hate the fact that it is so far away.  My plan will probably be to save as much money as possible and maybe fly Elizabeth out to come visit me every once in a while.   Or maybe my parents would be generous enough to take her with them when they come visit.  It just really sucks because she's away now for 3 weeks, and I may not even be here when she returns.    :("

"event","Well today was overall a good day, with some ups and downs.  I got to see John for probably the last time and it was fun because I got to take them to Joe's Shanghai and Venero's which are two awesome places and I got to show off the NYC-know-how.  The other side of this was I had to cancel my plans with Stacie...except I pretty much forgot to cancel them and really messed her day up I'm sure.  I feel extremely guilty and helpless at the same time.  It would have been so easy for me to have just called her and let her know I couldn't make it, or I should have just not gone to the city altogether.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I wasn't really thinking at all.  If you are reading this, Stacie, I am really sorry. 

On another topic altogether, I finised that testing with the therapist, and its like he did not tell me anything about myself I did not really know already.  I felt kind of cheated and almost said 'thanks for nothing' as a I walked out.  Maybe my parents and the education consultants and whoever else got more out of it than is known to me.  I still don't know anything  about what school I am going to in the fall.  Right now I'm just cherishing this summer.  The way I see it, its pretty much the last summer of my childhood proper, so making the most of it is extremely important.

"event","Its time to update.  Its been so long.  I'm in love, and its a wonderful thing to be in.  Every day is just a zillion times better knowing Elizabeth is there.  All the other things don't seems so bad because she is around.  I'd been wanting to tell her for so long how much I love her, and thankfully she asked me so I could tell her, I was so afraid of telling her, and she was afraid too.  Now I can't stop telling her.  It was her birthday a few days ago  (she passed her driving test today!! yay) and I got her a nice necklace with a blue Topaz in it, to match her beautiful eyes.  I think (I hope) she likes it.  She wore it today.   I thought it suited her very very very well, but I'm partial.  I'm so afraid of leaving her.  She promised to wait for me when I go away to school and everything, but its going to be so difficult leaving her.  Thing are so good right now.  Some friends have told me I've been spending less time around them.  Its true, but every time I come home from work its like...I want to see her so badly--I've been thinking about her ALL DAY, after all.

So they want to send me to a 'transitional school' which I'm told mean that its a mixture of work, community service, school, and possibly some therapy.  I'm leaving the type of school and all that up to the experts, because they'll do whatever they think is best.  Maybe I'll have some say  in the location but I doubt it.  I don't know how many of these schools there are.  I don't feel like talking about it at the moment though.  Later.

Do you ever feel like going up to people and asking them who they are and what they care about and what they are living for and where they are going and why they are bothering and what makes them tick?

Do you ever worry that others can read your thoughts?
Do you ever feel people are out to get you?
Do you ever feel that life is an illusion?
Do you ever wonder what it is to be alive?
Do you ever feel like the entire world is on your shoulders?
Do you ever feel that, even in a moment of happiness, that life is awful?
Do you ever look at a corner, or underneith a desk or behind something and wish you could run there and hide forever?
Do you ever thoughts big thoughts?
Have you ever had a thought like you were seeing through a window in time and space and everything comes together for  the briefest of moments and then you lose it all to oblivion and you can't even remember what you were thinking but it was big big big and you could just barely get your mind around.

I'm hiding and I'm running and I don't know for what or from what and I don't know where I'm going at all and I just feel like I can see myself in my head and I'm in a corner and somehow running at the sametime and the world is flowing past me and I don't understand any of it and I feel like a baby in the fetal position and the world is mine and all around me but I can't have any of it and its out of reach and far away and abstract.

Work has been hard but overall its been okay.  The people there are fairly nice and take the fact that I'm retarded and mess up things a lot in stride.  I hope I can keep the job despite my retardness because it would suck to be fired like 3 weeks from now and have to find another job.

I saw that therapist dude yesterday and I have two testing session to do to find out why I'm so unmotivated in school in stuff.  Hopefully it will help.  Hopefull they won't send me away for the summer.  Hopefully I can still graduate next year.  I need to get my shit together.

Lauren got really scary the other night and it bothered me a lot.  I'm really worried about her and I totally don't know what to do about it.  I tried all my vast 'communication skills' (its amazing they've actually helped me a lot, I guess I've learned something at Woodhall)  to try to help her but I couldn't and it got really really really really out of control.  I hope she's okay."

"event","I have just a little, random thing I felt like writing about today.  I don't understand other guys at all.  They just amaze and confuse me so much.  I'll give you a for-instance so you'll see what I'm talking about.  Yesterday I went to this house where children whos parents had been abusive or neglectful.  Anyway, this was the yearly reunion for everyone whos lived in the house at some point in the past two years.   (I guess afterwards they go to foster parents or something)  and so its a fairly big event and they had a DJ there and such.  Well, there were some other people who were volinteering to play with the kids and organize games and things like that, among them 4 or 5 girls probably around 14-16, I would guess.  The DJ played that damned Cotton-eyed Joe song that they always used to play at Bar Mitzvahs and stuff and these girls were dancing so I went up and danced with them.  Immediatly thereafter this kid Mike who goes to my school said something to the effect of 'Dude, what the hell are you doing, those girls are so young, and they're ugly as hell.  Besides, its not like you're gonna get any or anything""  Now...can someone explain this to me?  Maybe its just me...but the last time I checked LINE DANCING with a group of people  is about the farthest thing from flirtatious.  I was just being friendly and nice!!  I wasn't trying to 'get with' any of them.  (First of all, I have a girlfriend and Mike knows this).  Why is it that men don't seem to find it worthwhile to even talk with a girl unless they're planning on getting some action?!  Its ridiculous.  
You want to hear an even sadder story?  When I took the SATs I sat next to a girl that went to a boarding school in the area and so I struck up a friendly conversation before the test started.  Stuff like 'Where do you go to school, have you taken the SATs before, what year are you, etc.'  I was just making conversation.  I was just curious.  I finally looked back at Tyrone who was sitting behind and he mouthed 'What the Fuck??' to me.  As if talking to a girl is wrong or something.  Later on, he more or less repremanded me.  He was like 'That girl was so butt-ugly, why the hell you were you even /talking/ to her?'  I don't understand this kind of thinking at all.  Does a girl have to be a supermodel for a guy to talk to her?  Is it not okay make friendly conversation with a girl?  First of all, she really wasn't all that bad-looking, I thought.  Its not like had to marry her either.
What is up with this?!?!  Someone explain it to me because I have no clue.

That was my main rant for the day.  I saw Troy on Saturday.  It was tolerable.  All the girls went ga-ga for whats-his-name or all-their-names I'm sure.  Then again, all the guys were going nuts for whoever it is that played Helen and that other girl.  Achille's  girl.  They all thought he was the man because he got to have sex with a virgin.  Someone needs to remind these guys that its a MOVIE.

So that's all I've got for now.  Nothing really personal or interesting.

Peace, Love, Happiness,

"event","Well, I wrote this whole big long thing yesterday and forgot to actually post the darn thing before I turned off my computer, and its impossible for me to get it back.  So, I'll just give y'all the quick the quick run-down on things.  I need to start doing my schoolwork or else my parents are literally going to kick me out of the house.  I feel badly,  I desperatly don't want them to give up on my but at the same time I deserve it.  I've turned out to be the worst investment of time and money ever.  Anyway, so yea...I have to do that.  I also have to get a job this summer.  Its a shame, the last two summers of my formal childhood have been wasted on my Wilderness Program and now this.  I should expect this.  Why can't I just stop fucking up?  Its not that hard.  Its not that hard to just do the shit you're supposed to do.  At this rate I'm going to have a to take a post-graduate year at this or another boarding school because its doubtful I'll get into a decent college next year unless I can really pick it up for finals this year and start really strong next year.

Also, this place is not right for me at all I think sometimes.  I'm so much more...hostile than I was when I came here I never would jump on people for say something I didn't like.  Sure, I'm more 'accountable' (that's the buzzword around here) but it hasn't helped things any yet.  The people here always tell parents it takes two years for this place to 'sink in' so perhaps there is hope yet, I just hope my parents don't kick me out of the house or something.  I've really set myself up for a shitty, shitty life.  Its such a shame, for all my gifts, talents and intellegence, and despite all the advantages I've had (perhaps too many), I am still the world's biggest screw up.

In my post last night I talked about how John's all mad at me but I don't feel like getting into it.  I'm feeling pretty apathetic about it at the moment.  I've been hanging out more with Derrick and Tyrone and the other seniors, and they're fairly good company though sometimes they do give me shit, which I don't like.  I can handle it though.

Between all of this the best thing I've got going for me at the moment is Elizabeth.  I really miss her, but I talk to her almost every night, and it makes the day that much nicer.  She's just so great and I really like her a lot.  Its so strange for me to actually like a girl as much as much as they like you....but I'm very very happy about it.

And um....I guess that's it.  I don't really expect ya'll to read it but I havn't posted in so long that I needed to get all update-a-riffic.

I miss you guys!!!

It was totally great to spend time with Liz, she's AMAZING!!!  I wish i could spend more time with her!!  Its so sad...I won't get to see her again for a while, and I can't go to the junior prom with her (though she says she dosn't care, its still depressing that we can't even if we wanted to)....augh

Anyway, i'm out cause i don't feel like writing about stuff."

"event","Augh, I feel pretty much shitty.  I just sometimes can't deal with this place and its just...bad.  Unless I can get my grades up like...immediatly, I'm destined for another summer doing things I really don't want to be doing.  The last summer of my childhood.  Its a scary, scary thought. What happened?  Where did all the time go?  I'll be 18 in less than 8 months...that's...nothing....at all.  Its not as if my parents will abandon me when I turn 18, but...its just really scary.  All these things are going to change and I'm not ready for that to happen at all.  My grades need to get up, but I can't make it happen.  I sit at my desk and I just cannot do the homework.   I am able, I just cannot bring myself to actually do it.  Its terrible and the time is just ticking away.  They'res no way I'm coming home next year and if I don't start doing things better than it'll be someplace worse.  Belive me, it can get lots, lots, lots worse for Andrew.  

Augh, in the meantime I miss Elizabeth sooo badly.  I've called her every night, but yea...its not quite the same.  Its really a bummer.  Its such a travesty that once I actually have a girlfriend, I can't spend time with her.  I totally couldn't blame her if she just dumped me, I'm not worth the trouble.  I like her so much though.  I hope that dosn't happen, but it could.

Things are kind of out of control.  I keep finding myself in conflicts with the faculty.  Okay:  get this...I'm on dinner crew so I have to get to dinner <b>10</b> minutes early, even though the stuff we have to do before dinner takes about 2 minutes to do...and they yell at you if you're late...Its just little stuff...I don't understand why things are the way they are and I just want to rebel against it so badly but its just not worth going to Committee, and the other stupid ways they deal with people here.  Augh.  I have to keep in line the best I know how.

I can feel myself just snapping, and I'm trying really hard to stop it before it becomes more than I can handle."

"event","Ahhh.  Such a cool concert.  They played so well, it was so much fun.  It was great seeing Zack again for the first time in over two years.  It was awesome of him to give me like a 75 dollar ticket for more or less nothing, i took care of dinner and the cab, it was still really nice of him though.  I smell like fucking pot...it was that sort of concert....it was quite a scene.

I can't belive I have to go back tomorrow.  I'm going to miss Elizabeth so ridiculously much, it was really really sad leaving her today.  -sigh-  I'm going to call her often, but its not the same.

What I should really be focusing on is the bright side of this vacation.  I've done a lot of new and interesting and fun things!!!  <B><I><U>I got a girlfriend, an awesome one at that,</B></I></U> I got my driver's licence, I got to go to an awesome concert, I saw my old friend from camp, I ran across Route 10...a lot of good things...

Parting is such sweet sorrow...It might be a while until my next entry, or perhaps not, I do not know.

So anyway, yep.  Things are going very well for me.   I got my liscence today so congratulate me because I was sure I was not going to get it!  It was surprizingly easy.  I was all wowed and such.

Augh, I've been so confused lately.  Someone descided she'd drop a bomb on me and tell me that she likes me...someone I definatly did not expect to tell me that...exactly a week (almost to the hour, in fact) after I started going out with Elizabeth...augh...Its really upsetting... first of all, girls never like me so its so weird that she should, and its even weirder that someone would after I have a girlfriend for once in my life, and she knew about that, too.  The worst part about it was, she really though I was going to pick her and dump Liz without hesisation.  Honestly, if I didn't have a girlfriend I would probably go out with this person but...a wasn't prepared to change the way things are, espcially because I really really really like Elizabeth.  It must have been really painful for her for me to regect her like that, I feel really badly but I maintain my descision.  Augh, it was awful, just as she was telling me this this Beatles song came on my CD play that fit so well with the situation it just made me want to cry.  ARGS.  I don't understand it when things like this happen.  It was a real test for me, I'm not sure how or for what it just felt like one.

Anyway, its pretty much settled, and it happened a while ago by LJ standards but I wanted to write it down anyway.
I really don't want to go back to school.  This vacation has been so so nice, many good and interesting things have happened!

Peace, Love, Happiness,

I made a good amount of money working for my dad so I am pleased with that.  I need a good case for my guitar, so I won't keep screwing it up.  Now its finally the weekend!!!  Man, I wish life was like this all the time, no school, then fun on the weekends...I'm getting too used to sitting around all day.  I'll never be able to handle working every day.  I'm almost 18 but I'm still sooo far away from feeling like I'm ready to do all the things I'm going to have to do.  So sad.  

ohhh my mind is so messed up, going round and round.  must there be all these colors, without names, without sounds??

"event","Elizabeth and I finally are together...or very very close to it.  I'm like....wow...freaking out about it.  Last night when we went bowling were held hands and stuff, she put her head on my shoulder, and ahhh it was all just too nice.  i know it seems corny, and it is, but it was just like, a great great night for me.  We cuddled and stuff in the car on the way home and it was just...man...i was still shaking I was so nervous for like an hour afterwards and I couldn't get to bed till like 2.  Then I woke up early and actually felt like...awake.  I wish I could have seen her today but it didn't work out, but i'm going to see her again tomorrow night.  I can't wait.  Even though actions speak louder than words, I need to ask her out officially.  I WILL do that.
Its just YEEEEE!!!  Life is actually getting better!  Things are looking up (for the short-term anyway, I still have school to worry about) for Andrew!
WOW!!!  I cannot wait to see her!!!!  She soooo awesome!!!!

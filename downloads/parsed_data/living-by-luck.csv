"event","Okay. So this story is Completely True, and I think it's really funny, but in actuality it's probably not that funny.

Anyway, there's two things you should know first:

1. My neighbor has some foreign students from the local University. One of them is from China, and the other one my mom says might be from Korea.

2. There's this whole huge drama thing going on called 'Northern Pass'. It has to do with hydroelectricity, and a mew set of power lines. It'll make energy cheaper, create new jobs, etc., blah blah blah.

So my neighbor had to leave the other day to go to Delaware to pick up a horse to bring it to Pennsylvania, so she wanted my mom to feed the horses, and to watch the 'Boys' (basically drop them off at the Uni in the morning, and pick them up in the afternoon, and make sure they eat). And last night, when my mom got home, she said that one of the Boys, Fitzwilliam (the one from China; mom said it was his Americanized name, and I asked my mom if he was an Austen fan. She said that she didn't know), had been walking down the street when he saw a sign saying ""Stop Northern Pass"". (Seriously, it's a Big Deal.)

And poor Fitzy thought that that meant that he couldn't walk any further down the road. :(

But my mom said that one of them had been out at the time, and from the way my mom explained it, I assume that the neighbor explained to Fitzy that he could go past. (I'm hoping she just said it was something to get a message across, and not the whole background of it.)

But then my mom killed the funny by saying that in other countries, you could get shot for not listening to signs like that. :/

(Though today, my mom's boyfriend and I were driving home from splitting/stacking/and bringing in more wood for his friend & getting our own wood, and on one of the roads, there was a ""Stop Northern Pass"" sign. So my mom's boyfriend was like, 'Oh no, we can't go past it!'... and then like, 300 feet down the road, there was another, so he was like, 'We're trapped!')"

"event","&bull;&bull;<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Happy new year, everyone!</strong></span> (there's still a little over two hours left to go here.)<br /><br />&bull;I&nbsp;didn't manage to read 20 YA/10 Adult books this past month. I&nbsp;managed to read like eleven YA books and one Adult book. So here's what I read:<br /><br />Great/Glad I Read This books: <em>The Lost Hero</em>, <em>The Maze Runner</em>, <em>The Children of Men</em>, (<em>The Scorch Trials</em>)<br />Meh/No Opinion books: <em>White Cat</em>, <em>The Last Olympian</em>, <em>The Battle of the Labyrinth</em>, <em>The Ask and the Answer, Forbidden</em>, <em>The Cardturner</em>, <em>Siren</em><br />Not Great/Why Did I&nbsp;Read This books: <em>Virals</em>, <em>Elixir</em><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""book spoilers"">So right off, all but one disutopian novel is in the 'great' section. I think that the only reason why <em>The Ask and The Answer</em> isn't there is because I&nbsp;didn't have any emotional attachments to any characters like I did in <em>The Knife of Never Letting Go</em>. Because there's always that one person who annoys you all the time because they're always around, but when they prove their worth and end up dying, it hurts like hell (Manchee, <em>The Knife of Never Letting Go</em>; Chuck, <em>The Maze Runner</em>). <em>The Lost Hero</em> is also in there because after reading the Percy Jackson series, I just like this new trio of Jason-Piper-Leo better than Percy-Annabeth-Grover. Plus Hedge is awesome.<br /><br />The 'meh' books... The Percy Jackson books are there because even though I&nbsp;didn't really care for them that much, they were better than the first couple of books in the series and they really didn't belong in the &quot;why did I read this?&quot; section. Some parts were cute, like the end of The Battle of the Labyrinth when Nico visited Percy on his birthday, and Percy asked if he wanted some cake. :3 Though what I&nbsp;<em>didn't</em> like from <em>The Last Olympian</em> was the bickering between Persephone and Demeter. <span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">Also, considering that Persephone is only in the underworld for four months of the year for winter, </span><strong><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">why is she with Hades during the summer?</span></strong><br /><br />But again, the other books are there because I&nbsp;just didn't have that emotional connection. None were really that spectacular, and none of them really made me feel like crying. Though if you want to read a book that teaches you a little about the game of Bridge, I&nbsp;suggest <em>The Cardturner</em> by Louis Sachar. (Basically, Alton is hired to be a cardturner for his great-uncle who plays Bridge because he is blind <span style=""font-size: x-small;"">(his last cardturner broke the rule of never asking, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;)</span> and while being with him learns the secrets of his family <span style=""font-size: x-small;"">(like, supposedly his great-uncle's Bridge partner went crazy, but turns out that when she went into the asylum, she wasn't crazy - her senator husband was jealous that she was closer to the president than he was, and she kept on playing Bridge even after he told her to stop)</span> and helps his great-uncle to become a life master or whatever, even after he dies.<br /><br />And as for the &quot;why did I&nbsp;read this?&quot; books... when I&nbsp;heard that Kathy Reichs had a YA novel out, I was a bit skeptical. I&nbsp;mean, she was a good Adult writer (if her books are your thing), but I&nbsp;wasn't sure if she could pull it off. And it turns out...that I think that she can't. Tori Brennan is a little clone of Tempe. Down to drinking the diet coke. There's also a lot of it was exposition - explaining how the machine would get the dirt off the dog tags, explaining the Parvovirus, etc. Anyone who is interested in this stuff <em>can</em> use Google for this stuff.<br /><br />Also? Clearly obvious that the iFollow was going to be used to track them. i<em>FOLLOW</em>. I mean, <em>clearly</em>.</lj-cut><br /><br />&bull;&bull;In five days, my mom is getting surgery done on her ear. In ten days,<em> hopefully</em> my braces come off - I'm going to be pissed if I&nbsp;have to move this appointment.<br /><br />&bull;&bull;I also finally watched <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>. Though it figures that right after I&nbsp;buy the movie, it shows up within a week on TCM.<br /><br />&bull;&bull;I'm also trying to get <em>The Tudors</em>. I&nbsp;was hoping to get to Borders, as they had a two-day 50% off CD/boxed-set DVD sale (and <em>The Tudors </em>was on the list) but I couldn't and the sale ends today. :( However, I&nbsp;will keep after it. (And walmart only seems to have season 3. boo.)<br /><br />Oh, and I also want to watch <em>Misfits</em>, but I can't find that anywhere. :(<br /><br />ALSO, I'm super-excited for <em>Skins</em>. Both the US and UK shows. I already have a favorite for the US <em>Skins</em>: Abbud &lt;3."

And right before the link to the new board was posted, one of the frequent players/hosters said that we should be more careful because he got a warning for the game. He reposted on the new board, while adding that he was sure that the same person that reported him also reported dorkydexter.<br /><br />So basically, until further notice, Mafia games were off.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""anger!"">Then, after he left, this moron came on the board. One saying that &quot;mafia&quot; is only the Italian mafia and other bullshit.<br /><br />I&nbsp;told her that, no, there's other mafias:&nbsp;Russian Mafia, Irish Mafia, etc.<br /><br />And then she was like, &quot;Russians refer to themselves as the mob, and Irish call themselves the Family&quot; and more bullshit. (She later admitted that I&nbsp;was right.) Then this other moron showed up, one who I'm <em>sure</em> played before and started badmouthing Mafia. And after people left the Mafia board, she started a new one called something like, &quot;Long Live Avatar Games&quot;.<br /><br />She was continuing to badmouth Mafia, saying that it was &quot;off-topic&quot; (true) and that it was all this other stuff.<br /><br />One of their arguments (either the first moron or the second) was either, &quot;KIDS MAY SEE MAFIA AND ONCE THEY GET OFFLINE THEY MAY JOIN ONE&quot;. What the fuck, seriously? There's a goddamn game where YOU&nbsp;SHOOT&nbsp;CLOWNS. Hey, maybe a kid will play that and decide to go off and shoot clowns once they get offline.<br /><br />I made a post saying, &quot;Mafia was no more off-topic than &quot;OMG&nbsp;LINDSAY&nbsp;WENT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;JAIL!!!1!&quot; and they replied, &quot;At least it wasn't disgusting&quot; or something. (It was a few hours ago.)<br /><br />But another user said that they played it offline. And someone else was like, &quot;that's fine, you play it with cards and such&quot;. Well how are you supposed to play online? And another user said that their sister, who was in fourth grade, played it too.<br /><br />And you know what?&nbsp;When I&nbsp;was in fourth grade, I&nbsp;was 10. That's three years younger than the age of which you need to be without parental permission to be on the chat boards. Tell me, what's the real harm of playing online when people play it in school all the time?<br /><br />(And besides, we toned it down. By the game which we ended early, it was no worse than the stuff that you'd see TNT say in the editorial or plots, or what users would say in their NT stories.)</lj-cut><br /><br />This whole thing is STUPID."

I'm pretty sure my cats wouldn't care one way or the other what I call them, as long as they got fed and loved and treated like royalty.

We should attend to more important issues, like renaming fish to SEA KITTENZ*!!!! :D



*sea kittens may be the wrong name."

"event","I'm pissed that Sylaire fans are still in denial. And I'm definitely not talking about the river in Egypt.<br /><br />Because so many of these theories they're coming up with are so fucking ridiculous.<br /><br /><strong>Theory #1:</strong> Eric Doyle raped Meredith (because, y'know he definitely could. He's, like, the king of creepy) and then because she was ashamed of it, she lied and said that Nathan was the father. So since Nathan isn't the father, therefore Claire and Sylar aren't related and Claire can have the adorable baby Noah.<br /><br /><strong>What Logic says:</strong> Angela would have known sometime that Nathan wouldn't be the father of Claire. If she knew before, then she would have kept Nathan <em>somehow</em> away from Meredith. Also, if she was raped before being with Nathan, then she probably wouldn't have wanted to get close enough to Nathan to have sex with him. Plus, Tim K. wanted P&amp;C&nbsp;to be related in the first season.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Theory #2:</strong> Sylar had sex with Claire before now...and when HRG found out, he tortured and Haitian-ed Sylar, and then Haitian-ed Claire after she gave birth to baby Noah, as well as Lyle and Sandra. So the only people who know about baby Noah is Elle, HRG, and the Haitian. And Sylar is so mad at HRG&nbsp;that he pisses him off all the time (because by this time, he only knows that he had his mind erased and he's missing something important).<br /><br /><strong>What Logic says:</strong> What are you smoking? <lj-cut text=""canon-talk"">There is no period of time within CANON that Sylar could be with Claire. Because before <em>Homecoming</em>, he was pretty much busy killing Molly's parents, scaring Matt and Audrey, killing Charlie...and after, he was in Primatech, then with Momo (all over the country) and killing Dale, and then in NYC getting drugged by Momo, and then trying to kill Peter, then visiting his lovely <strike>Darling Mermaid Darling</strike> mother Virginia, and killing Ted, and then fighting in Kirby plaza that night (I&nbsp;believe) before being stabbed and being sent to Somewhere In South America to meet up with the Wonder Siblings. And besides, the first time that they meet up after K.P. was in Claire's place. So there'd be <em>no</em> time for any of that to happen to let Sylar be mad enough to piss HRG&nbsp;off.</lj-cut> And if they met before the series started?&nbsp;Claire lived in <em>Texas</em>, and Sylar lived in <em>New York</em>. He was just the adorkable watch-fixer before Papa&nbsp;Suresh found him. Claire wouldn't have been stupid enough to sleep with him. Also, <em>HRG&nbsp;WOULD&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;JUST&nbsp;KILLED&nbsp;HIM</em>. He wouldn't have stopped at torturing and Haitianing Sylar (because remember: <em>people don't kill people, daddies with pretty daughters do</em>). And just how exactly would Sylar have found out that his mind was wiped if only those three knew? Elle wouldn't risk making Noah mad at her, HRG would definitely not tell him, and the Haitian doesn't talk (canonly) to anyone but Claire, HRG, and Matt (only when he's with HRG though).<br /><br /><strong>Logic's final words:</strong> If Claire and Sylar were to ever become un-related again, it would have to be though Angela saying that she just manipulated everyone into believing that Sylar was her son. Because remember, Tim Kring had always wanted Peter and Claire to be related.<br />"

"event","from <lj user=""coffee_mill""> :<br /><i><br />Leave me a comment saying &quot;interview me.&quot; <br />I will ask you five questions. <br />Post the answers on your lj and then interview your friends!</i> <br /><br />1. If you had to choose only one DVD/CD/book to take with you on a <span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1224656192_2"">desert island</span>, what would they be?<br />DVD: <em>Children of Men</em>, because it's an amazing story about what could happen if the world suddenly became infertile.<br />CD: Adele's <em>19</em>, because there's an extra CD in the case, plus she's amazing live. I loved her when she was on SNL.<br />Book: Kathy Reich's <em>Monday Mourning</em>. If I were stuck on a desert island and wanted to get a book stuck in my head, it'd be that one.<br /><br />2. Do you believe in ghosts/supernatural?<br />I do, but I'm in denial. Because whenever I see something on tv about ghosts and stuff, or see something I don't want to see, my habits change or I stay up all night with some light on and don't go to bed until it's light out.<br /><br />3. What would be worse for you: no more music or no more computer?<br />No more computer, because it gives me something to do. I tend to play FreeCell a lot, or Hearts. Minesweeper's good too.<br /><br />4. Do you curse often?<br />Not often, but I curse more when I'm alone.<br /><br />5. What is your biggest dream?<br />Just to find something to do with my life and move away from here.<br /><br /><br />from <lj user=""ziggystarduzt""> :<br /><br /><i>shuffle your music player<br />using song titles, answer the following --</i><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""you were a child who was made of glass"">1.

He's supposed to be an escapee, and so when the people are leaving, they look over to the left and see a hole in the wall...but he's not in there, and he jumps out from the right and scares everyone toward the exit.<br /><br />My room is after you go up the stairs...the first room is three teenage girls eating &quot;people&quot; and when the group gets into the middle of the room, a mother of one of the girls jumps out and moves them into the next room, which is the &quot;Michael Meyers&quot;&nbsp;room. Katie said that it was a scene from the latest <em>Halloween</em> movie, when he kills his father while he's watching television or whatever. From there, people get pushed through a bookcase into my room, which was called the &quot;wax room&quot;...there's a bunch of mannequins in the room and you're not supposed to know which one's real or not. It's my job to move them into the next room.<br /><br />What's funny is that the room after mine, the guys building everything think it's haunted. Which...I don't know what to say about that. It's kinda funny, but not at the same time.<br /><br />Anyway, I have to watch the last two episodes of PB, plus download tonight's episode sometime.<br /><br />"

"event","<i>Comment on this post. I will choose seven interests from your profile and you will explain what they mean and why you are interested in them. Post this along with your answers in your own journal so others can play along.<br /><br /></i><b>Boston Red Sox.</b><br />My family is full of Red Sox fans. Everyone I know of is a Red Sox fan. (I'm sure if they're a Yankee fan, they're shunned, for being a non-believer. <font size=""1"">You probably didn't get that. If you didn't, don't try to figure it out.</font>) Because a long time ago, one was raised to be a Red Sox fan. And when they got married (to another Red Sox fan) they passed it onto their children. And so on, and so forth. I was raised around people who would curse if the Red Sox didn't get in, but they would also say, ""Hey, there's always next year."" And then one time, they did it. :) (<a href=""http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3/9dots4lines/131fc468.jpg"">Oh, and me at my only Red Sox game.</a>)<br /><br /><b>Crime Fiction.</b><br />Well, really, it's mainly Kathy Reichs, but I guess Max Allan Collins can count too, because he wrote the <i>CSI</i> books. I read the <i>CSI</i> books because in GSRville, <i>Cold Burn</i> is a big one. So I read that, and got all the others up to <i>Grave Matters</i>, minus the graphic novel. And because of<i> CSI</i>, I watched <i>Bones</i>. And when I learned that <i>Bones</i> was based off books by Kathy Reichs, I got myself to the library and picked up <i>Monday Mourning </i>(which isn't the first in the series.). Sometimes I read my crime novels to get rid of the SPARKLEY VAMPIRES <strike><font size=""1"">OF DOOM</font></strike>. I have 18.<br /><br /><b>Fanfiction.</b><br />I like fanfiction because it's a continuation. It's what people get from imagining, ""What if X went with Y to ____ instead of to ____ with Z?"" Or, ""What if Michael came out and told Sara the truth instead of having Nika steal the keys?""<br /><br /><b>Mogget.</b><br />I love Mogget. He is a white cat from Garth Nix's <i>Abhorsen </i>trilogy. He has a red collar and is bound to serve the Abhorsen. He talks. He's sarcastic, rude, and he sleeps a lot. He's pretty much my favorite character from the trilogy. Just remember: <i>don't remove his collar</i>.<br /><br /><b>Shawn Spencer.</b><br />What's not to love about a fake psychic? He's awesome, really. He's funny. And I loved him in <i>Lights, Camera ... Homicidio</i>. And <i>Black and Tan: A Crime of Fashion</i>. There was also that season 1 episode with George Takei (<i>Shawn vs The Red Phantom</i>?) and he just mentions ""The San Antonio Incident"" like it's real...and then it turns out in the end that it was...at least in <i>Psych</i>-dom. Oh, and he's kinda hot.<br /><br /><b>The Virgin Suicides.</b><br />The first I ever heard of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> was the movie, when it was on Lifetime or whatever. So a couple years ago, I got it. And was a little upset that the whole thing was pretty much focused on LUX.(<i>Really</i>?) Cecilia, my fave, got barely any screen time. And I wanted to get the book, but I never did because it's like $14, and I didn't have enough before, and I could now, but I never remember. (Though I just found a PDF.)&nbsp; But when I got the movie from Borders, everyone started to worry about me a little...<br /><br /><b>Wicked.</b><br />I had to read the book for the summer extra credit deal. Turns out that my teacher wasn't going to take the papers, but it's not like I did it anyway. But I had heard my Freshman English teacher mention it, and so when I saw it on the list, I bought it. And I loved it. And I fell in love with Elphie. And Galinda was a little weird at first, but she was good in the end. (And isn't it great how at the end, Maguire said that the broom was burned beyond recognition, so Dorthy had to take the green bottle, and after the Wizard saw it, he left? And then in <i>Son of a Witch</i>, the bottle was never mentioned?) Also, I shipped Nor/Liir. (And it kinda makes me mad that Liir never found Nor in <i>Son of a Witch</i>. Grr.)"

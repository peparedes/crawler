"event","Told ya my happiness was only brief. Negativity finally sat in. I started thinking and still am thinking, she's not ever going to actually use my number. I think she just to it, being friendly. I don't know for sure or anything, but that's what I think/feel. Oh well, at least I was heppy for a little while."

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMETHING MILDLY GOOD HAPPENED TO ME. Sadly it was cause of a bad incident in someone else's life, but I was there for her when she needed someone. Ok, let me start from the beginning.

This beautiful girl walks in the store, I just happen to be closing manager tonight, and she asks if we had a phone she could use. Julie pulls out her cell and lets her use it. After a few moments of talking to her boyfriend, he hangs up on her. Sad, I know. Well, she goes to wait outside of the store, thinking of what to do. ((She's from the Elk Grove area. Entirely different from DPH. Her area nice and everything. My area, Ghetto with a capital ""G"")). I decide to step outside and talk with her, try and cheer her up and everything. Remember, she's not from around here so we don't know each other. Hell, for all she knows I'm some psycho. But we start talking and it turns out her and her boyfriend are having problems and she's in some sort of ""program"" that's trying to help her out and what not. I'm not going to go too deep into what we talked about, but she did feel open with me though. I let her use my phone again and her boyfriend just continued to hang up on her. All she was doing was asking him to come pick her up. So, I ask if he's even willing to meet her somewhere. She calls him back and asks. He throws a fit again. So I suggest, Arden Fair. I told her I'll take her there. Yes I said I would. Hehe. So, once again she calls him and he ends up sending his sister to come get her. We had a nice little conversation in the car on the way there. I LOVE HAVING A CAR!!! Once she got there she asked for my number, and I was like sure, it you're ever in this area or whatever just give me a call. Then she called me sweet and a life saver, etc... God she made my night! Well I gotta run for now and live in the moment. My happiness may only be brief but it's enough to satisfy me for a bit. lol"

"event","Well, here's another post. Don't really have anything else to add, except for something that's been plagueing me for the past couple days. I know I probably should have said something to one of my close friends first, but I know of at least one whom will read this. The other I'm not too sure if I can call a friend any longer. What's the thing that has me plagued? Suicide. It's constantly on my mind. It's an answer for a shitty life. It's not a real solution, this I know. However, it's a solution to finally bring an end to the drama, the pain, the suffering that I've been experiancing.

Will I actually go through with it? I don't know. I've tried before. I have the scars to show, emotionally and physically. This life has nothing to offer to me any longer and I have nothing to offer it. I'm just taking up space and wasting oxygen and food.  Tell me one reason why the world would be better WITH me here than without. There isn't one. 

I MISS MY DAD!!!"

I'd like to think that a few are actually hearing his/her voice. that can prove so many things. 1) there's a power greater than man. 2) we're not alone and there's more, but i don't want to get into it. personal beliefs, i guess you'll say."

"event","2nd update in a short time. anyways since my last post in december, i have 2 tattoos now. one on my right shoulder/arm and the other on my right inner forearm. i'll try and have pix of them up shortly. my plan is to have my right arm sleeved. and then i'm covering my entire back. and after taht i'll probablly won't get any more. my sleeve is going to be seen as a heated discussion. people ARE going to give me shit for it, including the one that's going on my back. it's going to have some strong images and symbolism. i'm not going to rightly say what's going on my back, cause i want it to be unique. at least until after i get it. i know i'll be the only one to have it until someone sees it and might want something like it too. the sleeve, however, is going to be religious in nature. the one on my shoulder is a cross wrapped in like ribbon and it says ""RIP DAD"". it's in memory of my father whom past away december 28, 2004. the one on my forearm is kinda hard to describe. it's a ""empty"" man standing infront of a stone cross and being executed by a firing squad, but the firing squad missed. the bullets never touched him. just went around him. it's a work in progress still tho. that's it for now."

"event","ok, i'm going to post something i read in the paper today, hopefully someone else will read this too, cause this situation is far too familar. i would say i know who wrote this, but the truth of the matter is i don't know, but it could be a person i'm thinking of tho.

DEAR CAROLYN: I am stuck in an on and off romance hat has left my heart broken on numerous occasions. The perpetrator of my heartache is a wonderful man who treats me like a queen. That is, until he gets too clos, at which point he always decides that he is not in love with me and could never marry me. I know I should move on, but it's not that simple.
     The problem is twofold. Firstly, I have been madly in love with this man for over four years. Secondly, he never really vanishes. When we are not lovers, he remains in my life as my best friend. The loving acts he has bestowed upon me, coupled with the common intellectual and spiritual ground that we have discovered since meeting, have only made me love him more. I would like to break the cycle, but although I know that I cannot force him to commit, my heart will not let me look elsewhere.
                                        - Hopelessly Devoted

DEAR HOPELESS: No, the problem is onefold: You think it's OK to be treated like dirt. Actually, you thrive on the drama.
      <i>He is abusing you.</i> He is using the certainty that you won't leave him, and he is toying with you. Think cat (him). Think mouse innards (you).
      Think about living a life that isn't in the passive voice. The romance ""left your heart broken"": he ""made me love him"": you heart ""will not let me."" Being controlled isn't romantic. Where are you in all this? Other than feeding the cycle.
      Wherever you are, you need to find yourself, because your self needs to break up with a jerk. Quickly. Maybe look for yourself in counseling, perferably with a therapist who specializes in treating emotional abuse. For more information: (800) 799-SAFE"

"event","hello all.

ya know what? i'm going to take a lesson from one of my favorite group of people. they're a ka-tet, a fated group. Ka in not so many words means fate. and that's all life is. what ever is planned for us if by the power of Ka. i'm also going to, maybe, get the symbol for Ka tattooed on my left hand. i drew it there last night, and redrew it today before work. it looks good. lol and besides it'll match the other tats i want too.

but anyways. i'm not going to let life get me down anymore. or at least i'm going to try to. yeah, life has screwed me over, not as much as others, but still. then again i do have quite a few dark secrets. i've only told one other person the majority of them and i'm sure ya can figure out who. but she still knows what respect is and whatnot. i mean she hasn't said one word to anyone about them. so i guess there's hope for her still, but after recent events/months i don't know anymore.

well i better get going it's 30 til midnight and i wanna get a good night's rest.

pleasant days and pleasant nights, may we be well met next time."

"event","Well, I got plenty of ideas for my book. Too many in fact. I know I can't incorporate them all, even if I did it in a series like The Dark Tower or those annoying Harry Potter books. There's only so much I can put into it before it becomes trash. If I put too much into it then it just becomes nonsense. If I don't put enough in it, it'll be boring and not worth the time to write or read it.

I got several Ideas for the base of the plot, but I can't tell any of ya that yet. I've got a few twists and turns planned. MUAHAHAHA!!

A few things I can tell you though.....
They'll be several main characters ((BTW the character's name and/or likeness is already Copywrited, thank you very much))

<font color=""yellow"">Caliber Creed:</font> Anti-Hero  <i>((well I'm thinking bout it. He may just turn out to be no hero and a villian of some sort. Or possibly neither.))</i>
<font color=""yellow"">Azibeth Mortez:</font> Ancient Princess; Mother to Heaven
<font color=""yellow"">Heaven Muerte:</font> Daughter to Azibeth
<font color=""yellow"">Incognys Defoe:</font> Old friend to Caliber; Mystical
<font color=""yellow"">Reinfyre:</font> Vampire Prince
<font color=""yellow"">Camilla Dischain:</font> UNKNOWN

Those are the main players I have so far. They'll be a few more, but they'll be secret 'til then. Anyways I gotta get ready to go back to work. I'm on my lunch break.

Adios Y'all"

Die, Bitch, Die!!

You hit me when my back was turned
Now it's time for your mother fuckin' soul to burn

On your knees
You cry and plea
As the knife buries deeper in your skull
Blood flows from that ever so deep hole

Maggots crawl through your eyes
As I say my final goodbyes

You're buried six feet deep
As your bitch does nothing but weep

A stone tombstone stands at your head
As you lay alone in that cold dirt bed

When you reach hell,
I'll be waiting
And Satan's minions,
I'll be aiding

You shall burn for eternity
In this forever burning city

I just watch and laugh,
As you walk that unholy path"

Mirage

Looking into her eyes
Is like looking into a mirage
Nothing is as it seems
It's just a dream

A dream turned nightmare
A life shattering tear
Bring forth the pain
When the evil begins it's reign

Conquering hearts and souls
Lying in a six foot deep hole
Watching the sky turn red
As I lay alone in dread

God comes forth
And turns his back
As we begin to crack

Satan rises from his fiery lair
And laughs at our lives
Going into a downward spiral

I lay back and bein to relax
Watching Hell become reality
I remember nothing is as it seems
It's still just a dream
A dream I can't awake from"

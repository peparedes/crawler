"event","I've discovered my new favorite video game! Guitar Hero was invented by geniuses. I'm soooooo tempted to buy it. The only thing holding me back is the fact that it's $80 :( But I want it... (that's what she said)
AND they're making a new game with a drummer and a lead singer!!!! http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/_a/rock-band-impressions/20070705200109990001
Needless to say, I'm wicked psyched!"

"event","My job is officially a nazi! They keep giving me a shitload of hours. I'm so sleepdeprived and I have sooooo much homework! I work everyday except today and thursday. I'm getting payed 7.50/hr though. I work on Saturday from 2-10 and I get to choose when I get my half hour break. So if someone who works at the mall (cough-melody-coughcough)has the same hours, she should let me know when her break is.
I hate the word cough. -ough make the oo sound like through. Not the off sound. It should be coff not coo. That word goes on the list with crayon, cotton, button, leg, egg, and orange. DAMN THOSE WORDS!!!
So besides work I haven't done too much this week. I had my first day last Saturday then I went to a party with Brittany. It was fun, I wish I'd stayed longer. I went to see Little Miss Sunshine with Casey last sunday. It was pretty good. On Tuesday I saw The Last Kiss with Cassandra and Liz. It was good but the Italian version was better. After we went to Buger King and tried to go into the Army Barracks but it was closed. We must've looked retarded cause we had crowns on and we stood at the door laughing for a few minutes. Good times! Yesterday I watched Premonition with Felix. 
That's about it."

"event","I got a job. I start working at FYE on saturday.

I don't think I'm gonna do that yahoo thing melody was talking about because she can leave me messages here and I'd only know her on that.

I tried to go donate blood today but I didn't have a picture id. I'm not mad though cause I'm underweight anyways and it would've been lame to sit there for about an hour alone. I don't know how i'm gonna gain these few more pounds quickly besides eating like a fatass, aka melody. Next time I go I definately need to eat before the appointment and I need someone to go with me. Any offers? 

That busta rhyme thing finally worked. Wicked funny stuff."

"event","One of the most frustrating feelings in the world must be waiting for the phone to ring.

Brittany told me that FYE fired to people so they would call me to hire me. I stayed home ALL DAY and they NEVER called!I definately could've gone somewhere and done something today but no, I had to wait for the phone to never ring. 

Well it's been a year since my tattoo and now I can donate blood. Did you know you have to make an appointment to do that? I didn't... And there's a blood drive at hcc on friday but it's during school hours and i'm 5 pounds underweight! LAAAAAAAAAAAME!!!!! I guess I'll call the hospital tomorrow and see if they let me donate there.

Felix has been having weird dreams about being chased by a wolf. And another one where he's on a plane and the bottom breaks off and everyone's skin rips off... not cool. I wonder if it means anything. I kinda hope not.

Stars sounds wicked pretty!!!!!!!"

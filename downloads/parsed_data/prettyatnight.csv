Anyway, here are some pictures taken over Christmas Eve and Christmas. If there's a * next to it, that means I took it with the new AWESOME camera. :) Enjoy.

<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/home/shay/xmas/attack.jpg"">
I didn't actually take this picture, I was decorating the tree at the time. As you can see, the neighbor's dogs are attacking...I mean <i>playing</i> with my dad, who has a sticker on his head.

<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/home/shay/xmas/dumbdog.jpg"">
Oh my god, he's the dumbest dog...I love him. That's Curly, the neighbor's dog we take care of. On his left paw he is sporting a lovley green bandage. He broke his foot, but is too stupid to realize it and insists on moving constantly and playing tennis ball. He is defenetly not the brightest bulb in the crayon box. He also smells like shit.

<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/home/shay/xmas/playing.jpg"">
My sister actually took this picture, but that's okay. The ugly one, besides Curly, is me. Like my hat? I didn't exactly dress up that night...

*Here's an ordimant on our tree. Awww, that's me when I was four years old! I was so cute...whatever happened?

<img src=""http://www.angelfire.com/home/shay/xmas/ktree.jpg"">
*Another ordimant. My sister was probably about two or three years old. What a cutie.

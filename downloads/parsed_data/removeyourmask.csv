"event","i cant make up my mind. i wanted to not be in a dorm room college setting because i felt like i was missing out on things that i wanted to be around for. now i feel like all my efforts were wasted and that i should have just stuck with school like normal people do. but i know i didnt fit in. i dont like partying. i can only hold a relatively small amount of liquor in my system. its not that i even throw up. i dont know. it lost all its appeal to me. except a few weeks ago. grace had a gig and we were hit on by a cute guitar player who bought us drinks. whatever. so whats my problem. so my plan for now is to get the hell out of school as soon as possible. im going for my aa degree since i only have about a year left. i will be out before any other person in my class. i dont even feel like that is an accomplishment. 


ive also had this terrible headache for the past two days. i dont know what thats about. i do believe it has to do with the fact that ive been eating badly again. i didnt have a headache for over a month. now they are back. 

stop the world, i want off."

You got my heart and your daddy's boat
We got all night to make it float
We could sit on the shore, we could just be friends
Or we could jump in

Whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop this spinning
We could think it through
But I don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came, with nothing to lose
But I don't want to, if you don't want to

I got your ring around my neck
And a couple of nights I don't regret
You got a dream of a degree
And a shirt that smells like me
Yeah we both got dreams, we could chase alone
Or we could make our own

Wonderin' what you threw away
Holdin me, holdin you

I can't wait to get out of here for multiple reasons, including having been here since June, missing Shoreline, and being done dealing with unnecessary issues. Perhaps when I go home I will visit SW and maybe watch some basketball or go to the woodshop. I will need to pick up some new buddies since Brady won't see me, so my access to my friends last time I was home will be more limited.

Boys can be stupid, but for the most part they make good friends. I'll have to write about my random, spur-of-the-moment trip to Moneterey with Shawn on Friday night. It was fun, many wild adventures were had. 

I am ready to go back, and linguistics better be easy cause its getting increasinly hard to be motivated. Luckily my nice friend who works at Milano gives me the occasional discount which makes me motivated to study there!

But seriously though, Freshmen (and Steve cause you didn't know any better) the FINALS backronym really isn't that funny. I like to make up fresher versions like ""Finally I Now Ascend the Ladder to Sonambulence"" or ""Frustratingly Intense New Analyses Lead to Slumber"".

I'm not doing poem of the week anymore. That's what happens when you can't write. Another conundrum: no cello. I can't play now because i'll disturb the housemates. I can't play during break because I won't have her. 

Today was Spanish 135 and I finished with an hour and a half to go, ka-ching. Steve asked if he needed to call the cops to report a rape....i said the test consented, it had just never seen the likes of me before! (har har) so it wasn't THAT easy of a test, I'm just that good of a writer. (again, har har)

So these days I've learned that if I don't like someone, all I have to do is not invite them to my birthday party. Everything you need to know you learned in kindergarten!

Hanukkah party on friday. All the cool people are going. I have one more test tomorrow, and one on monday, but in the meantime i'll be working for Sher a few last times to make some money. He's now on the fence about trying to decide whether or not to keep the store. Speaking of on the fence, if you know my sister, tell her to stay in school. No boyfriend is smart enough to know what his girlfriend should do with her life.

"event","OK.....Take a deep breath, here is my break:

Saturday: flight back, I managed to make friends with some guys from the 104th instructor brigade and sat by them on the plane. I crocheted this cute little teddy bear in blue and gold which spc warren kept playing with and *sniff* I accidentally left on the plane. I got home, ate delicious chicken, and hung out with Brady. 

Sunday: Church, it was nice to see everyone even if I stayed downstairs the whole time making my Ukranian egg. The process is really cool and I've done it enough that I finished the whole process in an hour. I'm awesome! I don't have a picture tho, sad sad. I was a dork and thought ""oh, its break, I wont need anything fancy to wear"" without realizing I would. DUR! I met lauren's new boyfriend, he's nice, much better than kevin, penisboy as I liked to call him. I managed to somehow get sick in the middle of this day somehow, a nice fever, and that kinda put a damper on my movie night, but not really. Brady and I rented Pride and Prejudice, and I was apparently pretty goofy on meds in the car and I was singing about how hot Kiera Knightley was. We went to QFC so I could be a lentbreaker because I really wanted soda and was being really whiny. Good movie though! I liked it.

Monday: Brady invited me to go to the symphony on wednesday, so I had to remedy the no-dressy-clothes by going to platos closet, my favorite thrift store. I got a skirt (which I am now wearing) for $12 and a dress for $6 and they are damn sexy! I hung out with Brady a little also. Afterwards I hung out with Joefoe at his frat--Phi Tau at UW--and met some of his bros, they were really nice. It was fun, I wished I had more time to do it!

Tuesday: Went running, which was nice. Nice easy shoreline run, ignored the hills, but it felt good anyhow. I was supposed to go to tea with my mom this day, but we had to postpone it to the next day. We also had dinner with grandma, and I hung out with Brady more. 

Wednesday: went to tea with my mom at the Queen Mary teahouse. It was awesome, we had formal high tea which was teapots of tea of our choice (I had Yerba Mate!) and all the cute little finger foods that you might imagine the Queen having. It was really nice, down in the nice suburban area north of Seattle. Today was also the symphony. Brady took me downtown, and after a short stint of being lost we found ourselves (literally, he didn't know where he was) in front of Benaroya hall. It's a nice place, we saw the Russian National Symphony play Tchaikovsky and Shastakovitch, which wasn't as good as you thought it would be. I guess they were better under the commies. It was a huge group, but we noticed arhythmic playing and a wierd disconnect between the strings and the winds and brass. 

Thursday: walked the doggie after sleeping in really late! Brady and I started to watching Saving Private Ryan but didn't finish. We didn't end up being able to finish it the entire time!

Friday: I woke up with this insane earache. Went running with the doggie again, down to Syre and then up the hill. On my way back I did a snot rocket and heard this voice saying ""theres a girl after my own heart!"" and this random guy complemented me on my snot ejection. Funny huh! Later I made dinner for the RJJs and had them over, Brady came eventually and we hung out and such. Rich and Dad are either getting senile or just need to argue. Rich is especially bad, I put solid evidence of my points in front of his face, timelines from my history class, and he just kept blustering. 

Saturday: This day was the apartment part at Melissa and Jeremy's new apartment! Their apartnemt was really nice and I am really jealous. The drive up was really nice and I have funny video of Brady being silly. We ate food and such, and played games. I sucked at Kings, stupid Brady was so mean to me with waterfall! However, I WON pyramids, hooah! (that's another thing, I picked up a lot of bradyisms) and was a champ in battle of the sexes until I got a headache. 

Sunday: Went to grandma's for a big dinner thing with a bunch of the family but only got to stay for a little bit. Brady came too, and I showed him all the cool things in grandma's house. They are so much cooler now that I appreciate them more, I hope I have time to go explore her house more now that I understand. Then Brady took me to the airport and I was on my way back to Berkeley.

"event","I was just looking at my ""friends from other schools"" section on facebook, aka people I knew from high school, and damn. Everyone looks really good. I know they are just facebook pictures and thats why people pick them, but everyone looks really different. At least, the girls do. Make up and hair and clothes and stuff. They look the same, but just, a lot like college students I guess, in the way that another student would expect someone attractive to look. The guys look mostly the same, just hotter (for the most part). Where are the people I used to know? That's a multiple part question in that none of us ever talk. Partially my fault because I don't do my half, but I've been over this, it was due to a lack of effort on both sides that I largely gave up. I came to the conclusion no one was really close enough to me for it to really matter to them or me. That and I look the same as I did in high school,or very nearly so. I'm still wearing the same clothes. Damn internet. 

That being said, the other day someone referred to facebook as ""fb"". That means 2 things; that its in current enough use and has become normalized enough to get an acroynm for aim; and that process is more for efficiency than in-group distinction. Calling it fb right away would have been a move to try and be cool, use lingo, all that. Hooray for the internet. 

Brady came and visited me this weekend. We went to San Fran and a St. Patty's day party at my house; if you want pictures just holler because I have given up on trying to lj them. Melissa, you almost gave it away but I didn't realize until after. It was a nice suprise but very hard to get used to the idea of him being there, just because the worlds are so completely separate. Damn distance. 

I'm going home next week, some of my friends on the quarter system just had their spring break, so I'm sad that I'm going to be missing my favorite form of encountering those people that I just bitched about not being able to talk to anymore: The QFC encounter. It's awesome, because theres nothing more expected than pleasentries, and sometimes people genuinely mean it (thank you Erika Leeland!). I'm not sure at this point how excited I am, because the break looks to be really more structured than I'd like. Hopefully I'll get a lot done. Oh, also, I'm staying in Bezerk over the summer, and taking Arabic 10. Hooray for distance."

Don't know what to say next

Things that people pay attention to when they should be doing something productive like study or make friends! (winkwink) So, two weeks to go till break. In the meantime, a paper, a midterm, and a presentation are rearing their ugly, densely-toothed mugs into my peripheral vision. Spring break means Shoreline, whixh will be nice. I swear, I will go partake in the spring mating ritual that is vacation in Mexico one day, I just don't know when.

This weekend there be a day-late St. Patty's day celebration at my house on Saturday night at 11 pm. It'll go on 'till the wee hours, so wear your green. I fancy the drunken revelry in this city will be supreme this weekend.

The weather was beautiful today when I was out running errands. I took some pictures. I also have been eating large amounts of orange food. Cheddar, doritos, and popsicles to name a few. I hope the stains come off. In other news, the earth shattering feat of Megan winning at pool occurred not once but THREE TIMES on friday night. Thanks Steve for playing with me :-)

I joined a college bball pool on facebook, despite no real knowledge of it. Should be fun!

"event","Because he complained about me not posting. Well, boy do I have a story for you guys!

Today, I met Dan Rather. 

He was by Barrows, apparently having done some segment on environmentally friendly cars (which Cal campus has a multitude of, I swear they are like little slugs or something) and my friend poined him out to me. Jessie and I walked by, and sure enough, there he was. Amaris brought a Patriot magazine over to give to him, and talked about the articles Jessie and Amaris had written, and got our photo taken. I called my dad to tell him about it, because it's not every day you meet someone famous, and he thought it was cool and told me to call mom, which I couldn't because of class. 

Apparently he called her and made the fatal mistake of only saying ""Megan has good news for you"". For everyone else's edification, my mom LOVES conjecture stuff like that. She immediately went to first hope number one when asked what had happened. I told her, etc, and she sounded disappoitned, and said ""well, I thought because Brady was down there. . . well. . "" and I knew exactly what she meant. ""Something good"" automatically = Brady proposing to me. He will get a good laugh out of this one! I just thought it was hilarious, my mom really wants me to get engaged! 

In other news, my roomies are making Team Chilton Drinking shirts!! Mine says Drunken Irishman on the back, which aside from being my favorite drink, sorta could describe me. . . :-). The other ladies are:
Melissa   Screwdriver
Andrea    Mojito
Melanie   Tequila Sunrise

Soon you'll see us in our drinking finery. Also, as mentioned before, Brady was here this weekend and we had a good time! We toured Berkeley in the rain (which we are blaming him for) and went to Fisherman's Wharf, which was lovely and fun, if very cold. He thought this little town was neat, if a bit scary and infested with hippies. He thought it was especially funny when someone asked him to go to a peace rally (cause he's a soldier, in case someone didn't know). 

I had an exam today, IAS, and I think it went pretty well. Unfortunately my body was storing up cold symptoms ready to unleash the night before I had to take the test. I was studying with James, and closed my eyes just for a bit and fell asleep. He tried to wake me up like a half hour later, like ""Megan, you need to study, wake up"" and I told him ""NO!"" and went back to sleep. In retrospect, that was pretty funny."

"event","it all started due to a video sent to me by Rob about the contraceptive effects of World of Warcraft. It led to this poll in my profile (which you gentlemen haven't given me clear answers to yet) which reads:

Question for guys: would you rather
1) Play addicting, cool games like WoW, DoD, EQ. . . 
or
2) have sex with your girlfriend?

which has elicited the following funny responses. I hope to add more as they start happenin

meglet116: Magic Fishcow 2: WoW is really addicting megan

Magic Fishcow 2: i dont think you understand it
Magic Fishcow 2: the need to get more stuff
Magic Fishcow 2: and make the my gnome dance
Magic Fishcow 2: and kill things
Magic Fishcow 2: and dont even get me started on PvP games
Magic Fishcow 2: now THATS a rush
Magic Fishcow 2: woo
Magic Fishcow 2: i choose sex tho
Magic Fishcow 2: most of the time
Magic Fishcow 2: unless im close to lvling
Magic Fishcow 2: and i have rested exp built up

and in response:
omG liek kewl: Leveling up is very important.  A vagina is constant while a level in a game only comes once.
omG liek kewl: I understand this man's logic.

Other guys have given me vague responses like ""it really depends"". Come on guys! 

In other news, does anyone want to be my valentine?"

"event","So, today I'm sitting behind the artist formerly known as ""cute linguistics guy""( who is in my section) during lecture. (I say formerly because I know his name now) We both have computers, so I facebook him. The email pops up, he sees and looks over his shoulder kinda funny. We chat via aim, etc. I thought it was cute, the new form of passing notes. I love technology :-)

I don't really know how to report on the rest of the day. Mainly it was neutral. Spanish was awesome, even if I hardly spoke all class. Poesia desarraigada is even cooler in spanish. The weather was kinda confused too. I think the defining point was when the UPS guy called me beautiful; I made sure I told him thanks, that it made my day.

I got all my classes except 102A, which I have to replace with something else, I'm thinking this Cervantes class. I'm also kinda toying with the idea of studying linguistics more, its very interesting. Humanties make me feel like I can actually learn things, and tell people about them. Before it was a never ending struggle just to understand. This weekend was fun, lots of socialization. I played basketball without destroying my feet, but destroyed the rest of me playing broomball, which was also great. January is almost over. I get to flip all three of my calendars. I happened to have three last year, and on replacing them, decided that 3 was a good number. Excessive, but good. I wish I could handle more units, then I could take another class and perhaps ease my chances of being a junior on time. 

I'm still seething. I'm going to remember this."

"event","The kind of rain that doesn't just fall, but throws itself at you. That is fun to walk in. Today I had 2 cancelled sections, so I attended a grand total of a half our of class, where I listened to professor Ross make fun of nerdy students and football players. Podcast.

You know I've heard about people like me
but I never made the connection
they walk one road to set them free
and find they've gone the wrong direction
But theres no need for turning back
cause all roads lead to where I stand
and I believe I've walked them all
no matter what I may have planned.

A nice song, ""crossroads"", by Don Maclean. Yesterday I went to IAS, Spanish 135, and Linguistics 55AC. They all seemed interesting. IAS will be fun, a fiesty prof, interesting subject, etc. Linguistics seems interesting, but the professor is a woman and a bit of a liberal apologist. Logic may or may not be present in that class. Spanish is the same prof from last semester, so I might fall asleep a lot, but its poetry, which will be cool. However, I'm one of the only white girls in that class, and I feel <i>SOOO</i> gringa. The nice thing about humanities, you have 15 units and hardly any class time. And so far, not too much work. 

I don't really like going to school. There's somewhere else I'd rather be. I have no idea if it will ever happen, but these days I can't think of anything else. School used to be a venerated institution. Now its a housing for propaganda, personal adgendas, and fluffy majors given more credit than they deserve. Students used to have fun, before the university became the next nanny state. People still do learn (valuble and relevant things) and have fun, but I can't help but feel that something has been lost. And, as Ben and I might say, this makes me a romantic. 

There's gotta be something more to this life."

"event","These last few days have marked many momentous occasions. Harken, all, and hear that last night I won money in poker for the FIRST TIME!! I made 7 dollars. Four of those were Sarah's and my buy-ins which came from my dad's quarter jar and were returned to it, for a net gain of 3$, aka Brady's buy-ins. I actually beat Bryan too!! The women also beat the men in Taboo, it was a triumphant win to a close game. 

Another momentous occasion was today, eating the best roast beef sandwich of my life. I think nothing more can even be said about its loveliness. 

Tonight is the last I get to see of Brady for some time. We don't know how long, but I have a feeling that it will be a small obstacle. I love you :-)

Friday is my departure for Berkeley. I may solicit some of your help with baggage, if you are so inclined, I may reimburse you for BART fare or something of that nature, perhaps cheesy sticks. . . I'll tell ya my flight time when I'm motivated to look it up (aka not now). 

My Cal scarf is nearing completion, it needs but a fringe to be whole. It's beautiful even now, and I feel like a very skilled craftsman in the knitting biz."

"event","Yesterday I was out to lunch with Melissa (Jeremy is back in Georgia and she misses him badly so she needs company!) and we were having a swell time being gossipy girls in Mr. Bills, when a man stands up. Being from Berkeley, my first thoughts are ""oh great, hes going to announce some crackpot theory or ask us for money"". Boy, was I wrong. He says ""Excuse me, I'd like your attention for a moment. See this young couple right here? This young man is just back from Iraq, and they are so in love. I can see it in her eyes, in his eyes, heck, I can see it in my wife's eyes. For their sake, I'd like to say thank you and let you know what a good, noble thing this is"". That's not a direct quote, but it's near enough as I remember it. We all gave him a little applause, and I said ""God bless you, sir"". That meant something to both of us, even if we didn't say it. Both Jeremy and Brady are in for 5 or 6 years(I forget which) and Brady's first tour is already set for Germany in August. It's really nice to see people who care about servicemembers, even in this liberal nightmare of a city. 

Today I woke up much too late. It was kind upsetting, because I'd had so many strange dreams I didn't know WHAT was going on. I was very disconnected to reality this morning. I'd been woken up by some really shrill alarm sounds that aggravated me to no end, but I had no idea if it was night or morning so i covered my ears. Turns out it was the fire alarm. My mom had a candle in the bathroom and instructed my dad to blow it out, which he duly forgot. Turns out my sister walked by it without extinguishing it either. And yes, you guessed it, I got yelled at for not getting up and seeing what was going on. Granted, it's kinda stupid to sleep through a fire alarm, but I had no idea thats what it was. I also thought people were home, because I had no idea what time it was. I've never actually heard ours go off in maybe....a few years. I hear the chilton one all the time (ahem, thanks david, for putting one in the KITCHEN lol). I guess I'm lucky it wasn't a real fire and I didn't die. 

It's wonderfully rainy here. I guess I should go to sleep now if I ever want to please my mother by getting up at 5 am and being perky. Darnit all.  

I will write about the wonderful wedding soon. I don't have my cord so, no pictures yet."

"event","Whatever that means! I'm going to do the typical (at least, based on what my assumptions of you all will write, aka, ben, phil, and rob) and write a few parting (I wrote partying there, Freud anyone?) words to 2005. I've done most of the heavy lifting in my paper journal, so this will be a recap. 

Some unhappy things that happened this year:
-I didn't like my classes fall semester, it was very hard on me. I eventually failed 2 pretty badly.
-Spring semester was spent aching to leave the dorms and my former yucky roomies and foothill in general.
-I was turned down by the sororities I rushed, the Golden Overtones, and club soccer.
-I wasn't able to keep in shape or in practice of music or gymnastics.
-Worked a yucky summer job, but at least I got to sing while I worked. 
-Fall semester was really depressing and I had some of the worst lonliness and sadness I've ever dealt with.
-3 words: Massive BCR drama.

Some wonderful things that happened this year:
-Did poem of the week during spring semester, it was really beneficial to me and I hope to start it up this next semester.
-Published by the Berkeley Poetry Review, much to my suprise. 
-On the topic of writing, discovered that I have 12 journals full of memories and poetry, which is something to be proud of, I guess. 
-Kept in better touch with people. I got to visit KC, Evan, and keep in touch with other friends like Chris Zigler. I'd like not to lose you all again. This was aided by lovely AIM and facebook!
-Was chosen secretary of BCR which I love. I love my job and my club! BCR friends are wonderful friends.
-Was asked to live in Chilton, my current abode, with my awesome roomates and friends, Melanie, Melissa, and Andrea. 
-Managed to stay with Brady for a year and a half, and we are happy together. 
-I made lots of new friends.

This new year's, more than others, feels rather pivotal for me, because I have quite a few weighty decisions to make in the near future that I have absolutely no clue how to handle. However, going to Melissa and Jeremy's wedding last night helped me see things a bit more positively and be more optimistic. 

I think it meet that Jimmy Buffet be mentioned, since my journal is named after him. 

""Yesterdays are over my shoulder
So I can't look back for too long;
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me
And I know that I just can't go wrong"""

"event","So, got an F in calc and organic. Sucks ass, no clue what to do, but most likely dropping MCB and never looking at it ever again. Oh, and I just remembered, we get to declare this semester. Joy!

Yesterday we had family over which involved me eating lots of carrots and dip, and breadsticks and brie. Good stuff. We had dinner on the boat with the Jablonskis and Sarah and Jesse, which was fun because we watched Serenity and no Lauren is always nice. They are great because we're all intellectual equals (except perhaps my mom) so discussions are lively and fun, but my dad can't handle me because he's used to talking all the time. It's also pretty funny to listen to types like Jesse and my dad go on about how the world is a mathematical model. 

Christmas day was at my grandmothers, and also nice. We were missing a large part of the family, as my cousin Barret and his wife Heather (and new baby Jewel!) were in Spokane, the Posts (my mom's brothers family) were on Bainbridge, and the Speckhardts (moms little sister) live in Germany. Christmas eve was also nice, we had the pagent at church and I got drafted to sing in the kids choir, but it wasn't too bad, I got to hide behind tall people. We had dinner with some relatives, which was also nice. 

So far, break has been going well. Lauren is a pain, as usual, and my family's pretty normal, for us. Since it's kinda large, I'll do a little diagram or something.

Grandma Post + Grandpa Post(dead)
=
Laurienne (Bob, David, Triscia); Marjie (Dennis); Maureen (no husband, Barret+ Heather=Jewel); Gordon (Roberta, Cameron, Allison, Jack); Madeline (Dan, Megan, Lauren); Bernice (Tomas, Anja, Erika, Christiane, Lukas)

And that's my mom's family. Make sense?

Today we are going to Bainbridge for game day. I'm also going to a bridal shower for Melissa tonight. So far I've read A Farewell to Arms, and I'm reading this book Rains all the Time about our fabled NW weather. Farewell to Arms was pretty good, but you can tell Hemmingway is a romanticist because he gets tired of the story and bam, just kills the characters off and ends the book. I'm going to go now."

Also, if you feel the need to debate/discuss these things, do so elsewhere because I'm only posting for humor/insight's sake. I debate enough with the people that logic forgot on this campus.


irishman227:  21 WAYS TO BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT
 
 1. You have to be against capital punishment, but support abortion on
 demand
 2. You have to believe that businesses create oppression and governments
 create prosperity.
 3. You have to believe that guns in the hands of law-abiding Americans
 are more of a threat than U.S. nuclear weapons technology in the hands
 of Chinese and North Korean communists.
 4. You have to believe that there was no art before Federal funding.
 5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by
 cyclical documented changes in the earth's climate and more affected by
 soccer moms driving SUV's.
 6. You have to believe that gender roles are artificial but being
 homosexual is natural.
 7. You have to believe that the AIDS virus is spread by a lack of
 federal funding.
 8. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th-graders
 how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids about sex.
 9. You have to believe that hunters don't care about nature, but loony
 activists who have never been outside of San Francisco do.
 10. You have to believe that self-esteem is more important than actually
 doing something to earn it.
 11. You have to believe that Mel Gibson spent $25 million of his own
 money to make The Passion of the Christ for financial gain only.
 12. You have to believe the NRA is bad because it supports certain parts
 of the Constitution, while the ACLU is good because it supports certain
 parts of the Constitution.
 13. You have to believe that taxes are too low, but ATM fees are too
 high.
 14. You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and Gloria Steinem are more
 important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, Gen. Robert E. Lee,
 and Thomas Edison & A.G. Bell.
 15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but racial
 quotas and set-asides are not.
 16. You have to believe that Hillary Clinton is normal and is a very
 nice person.
 17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't worked
 anywhere it's been tried is because the right people haven't been in
 charge.
 18. **
 19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag,
 transvestites, and bestiality should be constitutionally protected, and
 manger scenes at Christmas should be illegal.
 20. You have to believe that illegal Democratic Party funding by the
 Chinese Government is somehow in the best interest to the United States.
 21. You have to believe that this message is a part of a vast, right
 wing conspiracy.

I'll post more interesting things later. Right now I feel like death by studying, and thats enough of that! I'll be home in Shoreline on the 18th in the afternoon."

"event","Late night studying can bring interesting things to light. For instance, I love Ghostbusters, the original fabulous movie. Here's a line:

Egon: ""Oh, and one more thing, don't ever cross the streams""
Venkman: ""And why don't we cross the streams?""
Egon: ""could be bad""
Venkman: ""I'm sorta fuzzy on this whole good-bad thing""

and other classics: ""I've been slimed!""; "". . .And the flowers are still standing!""; ""Dogs and cats, living together, MASS HYSTERIA!""

I could go on, but imagining the 80's haircuts makes me laugh too much. A great movie though. 

Other things: I have lyrics from the Micael Buble song ""home"" stuck in my head. I have posted it before so here's a piece: 
""And I feel like I've been living someone else's life
like I just stepped outside
when everything was going right""

Tonight I'm studying for a chemistry quiz tomorrow at 2. Those who thought I was being motivated/productive and getting a jump on finals were wrong, I'm just procrastinating as usual. I've made some progress, and I'm kinda up for a late(r) night study session to get some things done. It will be a good test of my hypothesis that brains really shut down after 3 am. Well, thats in one minute.
 
In general, classes are going pretty poorly. That's the response you're going to get from me if you come up to me at nearly any point in the day. My mood will vary based on if I've eaten (something nice, or at all, really) and how my social interactions have gone, but school maintains its suckiness. (Insert Phil's obligatory black-hole comment here). Math is not lookin good for the record books, but the final is a good chance to get my grade to passing, in fact I'm optimistic. Now if I can just remember how to integrate.....Physics is alright also. I have 100% in labs (thanks to my aweseome GSI who doesn't read this, thankfully, because all the ""My GSI is so hot"" comments would go over a little funny) and should have around 75-80% in homework (too bad I don't have more but oh well). I'm hoping to pass that class with maybe a little higher than a C, that would be awesome. I'm not super hopeful though. Spanish is the predictably easy class. Although. . . Iarocci is supposedly collecting an essay he has yet to assign on thursday, coupled with a takehome essay final, makes me kinda wonder what we're going to have to be working with. Predictably, I've also not done my spanish reading, although I printed it all out. It's sad that that class has to suffer at the hands of my other classes. I am failing chemistry (like....abject failure, and it looks bad) but I'm hoping to pull and Andrea and pass with a C after a stellar final. That means serious effort on my part though. 

And that is the status report for school as it stands, at 3:04 am on (technically) Tuesday morning. Pike has their Christmas date party Tuesday night, I'm going with Shawn, my best/oldest friend at Cal. It should be an awesome time, it certainly was last year, so I expect great things. The layout for this week is as follows:
Tues: math/spanish/ochem; Quiz, Date party, (need to start spanish paper)
Wed: math/physics; (need to do physics homework and math, make BCR evals)
Thurs: math/spanish/ochem; math quiz, BCR, prep for the party
Fri: math/physics/extra review with hot gsi; BCR end of the year party

Start studying for finals amidst all this (and more, which I'm leaving out because its too mundane or boring or whatever) and such. 

12 days. I miss you."

2) people who have no conception of the space (and people) around them

3) groups walking excrutiatingly slowly

4) when everything looks the same in every store but I STILL can't find anything I like

5) there seem to be no hot guys left in my hometown on a post-holiday saturday. oh well.

6) nobody sells dresses anymore!!

So, from the above checklist its fairly simple to gather than I just went to the mall and luck was not with me, so no red dress for Megan. I found one that was lovely, but it was $98.00, which was rather high for a dress I wasn't 100% crazy about. It wasn't a total flop though, at least I got Shawn a belated birthday present. I also proved that I can beat the system TWO TIMES by parking in Lynwood highschool parking lot instead of the mall, and parking behind famous footwear instead of trying to brave the mess that is the Old Navy parking lot. I also pwned the mall by walking Alderwood Mall and browsing every store I wanted to see in about an hour and a half. Oh yeah, I'm good."

I did make some progress, but I fear it won't be in time. So, the schedule goes tuesday midterm, wednesday night flight to Shoreline for Thanksgiving weekend. I am mixed on returning for various reasons. The outlook so far (I asked my parents but they have yet to respond) is a poker party in my basement on friday, so call me for more info. 

Today I took some HP sorting quizzes, and although I got mixed results, the conclusion is that I'm in Hufflepuff. Odd huh. I guess I like it. So that gave me the idea to dress up for the movie. Now I'm kinda stuck on it, its a cute idea. :-)

This week was Big Game week, and Cal retained the coveted axe for hte 4th year in a row. The Big Freeze was a 13-1 blowout where hte most outstanding players were the CalBand in all their innapropriately-chanting glory. I sat with BCR and friends, it was amazing. I traveled to my first away game on saturday to see Cal beat Stanfurd on their own turf. The best part was that Blue FAR outnumbered Red in their own staduim as well. Steve Levy came through for a great 27-3 game, Tedford should have put him in much sooner in the season, cause he really performs in running and passing situations. 

I've been doing pretty well lately. The Bart ride and caltrain rides to and from Shallow Alto were awesome, especially on the way home, teaching the freshman/junior transfers/Chris Page the words to a bunch of cal songs, and having alums sing the drinking song along with us. We also sang boyband and old school songs and acted silly. We also got lost looking for caltrain. Next time, Chris dosen't get to lead :-)

Until next post, go bears!"

I had a wonderful weekend, lots of fun and some progress for school. Tuesday we made cards for soldiers. Brady got his orders and will be Ft. Lewis, which is what he wanted. Soon I'll be home for a nice weekend and good food. I'm in love with the weather; the nights and sunsets here, the ambiance is lovely. It's big game week, and trouncing Stanfurd is eminent, despite shitty quarter-back-ness. I went to an awesome invite and met awesome new friends. 

I'm reluctant to attribute this to anything more than my irrationality as a woman (thats for you Ben, you know I don't actually believe that). It's just on the edge of something more, maybe even level jumping, which would be totally cool. Just wanted to say that I love you all, thanks for dealing with my crap when things weren't this good.

"event","The week from hell is over! Since tomorrow we honor our veterans, today is my friday! Here's an update, I know I've been absent from nearly everyone's lives, but studying and stressing are two good excuses for why. 

Physics wasn't NEARLY as bad as I thought it would be. I made my cheat sheet really comprehensive with examples, which turned out to REALLY help. I skipped the first problem (they warned us it was long) and did 2 and 3 with relative easy (much to my suprise) and 4 and 5 fairly well. One was hard, as predicted, and I did about half. Most of my answers seemed correct, but some were definetly off by some orders of magnitude. Ok, done talking like Phil :-)

Calc quiz was like normal, I probably got a 5. Spanish presentation was ok, it turns out I probably could have bullshitted more than I did and got away with it, but my speaking skills weren't great. I definetly need to work on that. Ochem was a disaster, but I expected that. I'll take the F and study more for the next quiz and midterm. That damn class is so much work!

Speaking of Phil, I have a berkeley science review for you once I finish it. Here are my weekend plans: Tonight, I'm going to get pretty, go to BCR, then go party with my gentlemen friends from AEPi. Tomorrow I will sleep, some form of working out, play cello, and do sign-waving in Emeryville to honor our veterans. At some point I hope to go to the city with shawn. Saturday is the USC game, baby!! GO BEARS!! After this, it will be big game week, so don't be suprised if I start having more school spirit outbursts. 

In unrelated news, Brady dropped his airborne training (didn't want to sit in holdover for months) and so will be going to a unit soon. That means going overseas soon, to Iraq, which leaves me with lots of things to think about."

We were at the Arnold rally (basically a bunch of placid supporters and rather lame opponents) and someone from Telemundo (yes, the spanish channel) interviewed me. I was so nervous that my spanish sounded like a freakin first graders. Oh well, I'm famous. 

I love the rain. I walked in it today and got completely soaked. Rain means a lot, maybe it will mean the start of something new. I changed my facebook profile, by the way. Not a big change, but I figure these days its now or never for new experiences, so I should let things flow instead of trying to restrict everything. 

I dislike how people come strongly into favor in ""friendships"" made from who knows what, and the conveniently fade into obscurity by their lack of interest. I love maintaing friendships, but you stupid boys, when you don't get what you want. . .grrr. Its really only one or two people, but still interesting for someone who knows as many people as I do to look around and think....theres another person who no longer talks to me. For a dumb reason too. I also dislike maintaining lies. I'd love to tell all the friends of a certain person what a liar they are, hopefully I can justify that. Yay for cryptic livejournal talk! I feel like a high school student again!

In other news, CalBand great! Especially cal band freshmen great. Lol. Our football team on the other hand. . that's a painful pill to swallow, especially when Tedford can achieve SUCH greatness. What the freaking heck is he still doing with Ayoob in the game?!?! What does he have to prove? Just freakin put in Levy already and lets try and salvage this season!

Finally, physics is going to kick my butt. It's been decided, the only unknown (besides V, P, rho, omega, alpha, theta, etcetera) is how badly I will fail. Pretty pessimistic? I think SO! Know what I also think is funny? Not many of you california kids will be able to tell me what a bumbershoot is. Yay Seattle! It's alright, I don't need one! Bring ont he rain! It's like Coach Jackson always said, ""embrace the rain and you've already beaten the other team"". I miss Coach Jackson. Shorewood won't ever have another coach like him."

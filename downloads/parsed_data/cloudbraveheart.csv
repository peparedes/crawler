"event","darkness creeps faster faster 
light fade dimly into&nbsp; coners
people hustle paper tussle 
noise gets louder louder
i hear my voices&nbsp; singing 
songs of star dust agent timings
long before my times arrival
no time awaits this febel body 
sadness follows crys of timing 
holding onto you forgotten 
songs of sadness never forgotten"

"event","me im happy sad and undecided 
my music lives me and randomises
my hope and dream still dieing
but today i feel a smile 
a friend will call and poke 
a friendship will be guided 
through a life as it will live 
this will happen and may fizz

sorry gys i like to write it just comes out some times"

"event","Amazon (both Canadian & American sites) are offering the kindle version of <i>TheVery Best of Charles de Lint</I> free, today and tomorrow.  If you're somehow unfamiliar with the name, deLint is one of the originators of the urban fantasy genre, and his Newford stories are some of the best examples of the genre even now.  (And if you like the free anthology, there are lots of other short stories available singly at the moment, but I'd suggest<i> Memory and Dream</i>, a novel about magic and danger and art.)

And if you don't have an e-reader, you can download the desktop version for your computer, and if you do have an e-reader but not a Kindle, the author says that the file is DRM-free and can be converted to other formats."

Thus I walk from fete to fete, 
From anniversary to anniversary, 
From grape harvest to grape harvest, 
As I walked, yet a child, 
From the Council Chamber to the chamber of rest . . . 
In the depths of my father's palace, 
Where every footstep has a meaning.

"event","So the shortest day came, and the year died,
And everywhere down the centuries of the snow-white world
Came people singing, dancing,
To drive the dark away.
They lighted candles in the winter trees;
They hung their homes with evergreen;
They burned beseeching fires all night long
To keep the year alive,
And when the new year's sunshine blazed awake
They shouted, reveling.
Through all the frosty ages you can hear them
Echoing behind us - Listen!!
All the long echoes sing the same delight,
This shortest day,
As promise wakens in the sleeping land:
They carol, feast, give thanks,
And dearly love their friends,
And hope for peace.
And so do we, here, now,
This year and every year.
Welcome Yule!!
               -- Susan Cooper"

"event","&nbsp; &nbsp;  <lj-cut text=""It would be pretty out there if one didn't have to go out in it.  Haven't yet worked out how of the day's plans I'll be cancelling."">Ice storm in Toronto last night.&nbsp; Power went out just before midnight, and came back at 7:45 this morning.&nbsp; My mother&#39;s place, just down the road (but across a major street), never lost power at all.&nbsp; I am thankful that this little place heats back up quite quickly.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It had been mild but very rainy most of yesterday - not a day for being out much, so I curled up in warm PJs &amp; invited my mom over, and we watched the O&#39;Toole/Hepburn version of <i>The Lion in Winter</i>. &nbsp; Felt quite decadent in my cozy new basement, eating goodies and reveling in Katherine Hepburn&#39;s delivery of brilliant lines.&nbsp; (Incidentally, Hepburn at 62 was pretty much the only actor in the film playing her own age; Peter O&#39;Toole was 37 when he played England&#39;s 50-year-old Henry II, Anthony Hopkins was five years younger than the man playing his father, and Timothy Dalton at 23 was playing the 17-year-old King Phillip of France.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christmas prep is really and truly done: my wrapping&#39;s been finished for days, the part of the Christmas Day meal that can be made ahead got done on Friday, and my sister has decreed that we are not allowed to even think about adding things to her kids stocking.&nbsp; (I scaled back with the kids: I often find myself going overboard because I keep seeing little things they&#39;d enjoy, and this year found myself returning a couple of things last week.&nbsp; Beans is getting a card game, and Little Wisdom The Book of Why, and then they&#39;ll share a small cardboard castle that they put together and colour/decorate themselves.&nbsp; That&#39;s plenty.&nbsp; The nephews in BC and the niece near Guelph all got books by Neil Gaiman.) It was <i>really </i>not an evening for the Solstice Parade in Kensington Market: still raining, and the temperature dropping rapidly.&nbsp; I cooked some Manitoulin rainbow trout, egg noodles, and belgian endive, and watched the third of my seasonal DVDs: Sting&#39;s <i>A Winter&#39;s Night</i>, recorded in Durham Cathedral.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today is full of social visits: sunday brunch with my mom and sister-et-al, afternoon out on the Danforth at a colleague&#39;s place, and then my friend J coming to my place for post-Solstice treats and wine.&nbsp; But the trees are covered in ice, the lights are still flickering occasionally, and the roads are treacherous.&nbsp; J &amp; I both travel by public transit, which may be wonky today.&nbsp; Will have to see how it progresses.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow was supposed to be a trip to Hamilton to take my 98-year-old grandmother out for holiday lunch, but she called yesterday to cancel, even before the weather got bad.&nbsp; She has a chest infection, and is on antibiotics, so feels lousy and intends to stay in.&nbsp; She&#39;s quite frail this year - finally, I suppose, but it&#39;s odd to see: tires easily, worries about her memory, has shaky hands, and isn&#39;t as steady on her feet as she was at 97.&nbsp; She&#39;s the last of my grandparents - the last of that generation among my extended family and most of my friends, too.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow evening is supposed to be the rescheduled get-together with my friend H, who&#39;s in Ontario for the holidays with her and her husband&#39;s families.&nbsp; We had planned for this past Friday, but the weather forecast was lousy and they didn&#39;t want to drive in from Burlington.&nbsp; It ended up being damp, but mild, whereas tomorrow is now looking to be much worse for traveling.&nbsp; So that may not happen either.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of plans up in the air, and that&#39;s just fine. If I see people, it will be great; if not, we&#39;ll chat on the phone and I will snuggle down in my cozy little home. </lj-cut>"

<li><i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> is <i>Othello</i>, with a happier ending.&nbsp; It&#39;s not really a nice story: jealousy, deceit, girls ending up dead for things they didn&#39;t do.&nbsp; I&#39;ve been saying this for years.&nbsp; (Possibly here in LJ, even.)</li>
<li>I like the play anyway.&nbsp; Probably unsurprisingly, I loved Branagh&#39;s <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/?ref_=sr_2"" target=""_blank"">1993 film</a> version.</li>
<li>Joss Whedon, Amy Acker, Alexis Denisof, Nathan Fillion, Tom Lenke, Clark Gregg, Reed Diamond, and Sean Maher: WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.</li>
</ol>  &nbsp; For my money, the new <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2094064/?ref_=sr_1"" target=""_blank"">film</a> works: using a contemporary setting and Shakespeare&#39;s script (with one word changed), it&#39;s well-paced and well-acted, and uses many of Whedon&#39;s standard directorial moves (such as following a very dark moment quickly with humour; mostly visual in this case).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Whedon fan in me was happy to see Fred &amp; Wesley finally get a happy ending, and the Shakespeare fan was pleased to only rarely catch myself comparing it to Branagh&#39;s movie.&nbsp; The Watch is lovely understated, Agent Coulson is grand as Don Pedro, and Sean Maher does a nice job with the stiff character of Don John.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Had brunch after class with <lj user=""littlehoudini"" /> yesterday, and then spent the rest of the day being virtuously productive.&nbsp; Today was similar: a nice long skype conversation with <lj user=""amadanbeag"" />, and between then and now I&#39;ve been working, and working well.&nbsp; It was a day for accomplishing things that had been hanging over my head.&nbsp; More than I knew, apparently, because the little outbreak of eczema I&#39;ve been dealing with for a couple of months cleared up in the middle of the afternoon. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now it&#39;s the weekend, and<i> I have no plans</i>, and I am glorying in that.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to burrow in: not call people, not get together, not grade papers or work on the conference paper for Orlando.&nbsp; There&#39;s time for all of that - there really is; I&#39;m not just avoiding - but for a day or two I want to cook nice meals and have long baths and read for pleasure.

   The weather change in Toronto overnight - a temperature drop from nearly 18 at the height yesterday to minus 9 at the moment, combined with white-out blizzard coditions on the roads (I'm riding home on the bus right now, at less than haf speed because the driver can't see and we're fishtailing slighty at stops) - meant the campus is deserted this morning.  Like, silent and empty, even in the main areas.

In an S1 episode, he&#39;s driving in his truck, listening to the Dukes of Hazzard theme song on the radio. Which means that when he guested on <i>Leverage</i>, and the character&#39;s cell-phone ring tone was the theme song for the General Lee, you get two references for the price of one...

&nbsp; &nbsp; People just didn&#39;t text all that much...
&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;m used to it in shows I watched at the time: I can&#39;t imagine Buffy texting.&nbsp; But starting something that&#39;s new to me, and I feel as if they should have the tech.&nbsp; (Especially because it&#39;s 1989 when the Kents find Clark and his spaceship, but the high-school first season is just listed as &quot;today&quot;...)"

"event","&nbsp; &nbsp; I use To-Do lists a lot.&nbsp; I love scratching things off, but the list gets longer and the number of scratches is small compared to whatever needs doing in a day.&nbsp; I need to get back to &quot;attempting a reasonable number&quot; of tasks, rather than &quot;never getting it all done&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp; Plus, at some point something happens that needs to go near the top of the list, but there isn&#39;t room, and then do you re-write or draw arrows or use numbers to indicate priority...?&nbsp; (No: I&#39;m not really asking advice.&nbsp; Just noting my own particular weirdness.)
&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, I wrote out the things I needed to get done today onto individual post-it notes.&nbsp; Four - and then one extra, so five - items.&nbsp; I stuck the notes on my fridge.&nbsp; And I kept seeing them, as I went back and forth, as I did other things.&nbsp; And over the afternoon, four of the five tasks got done and notes got taken off the fridge.&nbsp; Maybe the fifth tonight?&nbsp; Probably not, but it&#39;ll be there looking at me while I make tea in the morning, and I think that will be useful.
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#39;t like things stuck to my fridge, see. And I <i>do </i>like scrunching up paper and putting it in the recycling.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; We&#39;ll see whether this works for more than a day...&nbsp; But I have hopes.&nbsp; I may keep a Master-list of To-Dos somewhere, that can get longer and longer and doesn&#39;t have to be in order, and then choose the X number of tasks to post on the fridge on a day.&nbsp;

&nbsp; Today, I&#39;m painting at my mom&#39;s place: she&#39;s had her basement renovated by the same contractor who did much of my place, and while it was a very slow process, it&#39;s done and it looks great.&nbsp; She and I will paint walls and ceilings and trim, and then move furniture, over the next week.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Other than that, this week for me is the time to finish up shopping for gifts.&nbsp; I&#39;m about half-done, but because I have a list, I often think more is actually paid for than is accurate...&nbsp; I&#39;ll probably start getting out decorations at my place next week."

"event","&nbsp; I saw the new <i>Alex Cross</i> a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I like movies with action and explosions, and I needed distracting.&nbsp; It was fine, I thought, but two weeks later it hasn&#39;t really stuck with me.&nbsp; Last night, I saw <i>Skyfall</i>.&nbsp; Which will definitely stick: as I told<lj user=""amadanbeag"" />earlier today, this movie is really fun.&nbsp; It is, of course, an extended fight-and-chase scene, but it&#39;s well-paced and well-scripted and well-acted.&nbsp; There are a bunch of post-modern nods to classic Bond tropes that had the audience in surprised laughter (the bit near the end where he finally loses his cool is marvelously shot-&amp;-scored), and though there&#39;s a bit that is so like a bit in the Avengers that I thought they&#39;d borrowed the set, the &quot;Bond girls&quot; had such small parts as to make them barely there, the supporting cast (Dame Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris &amp; Ben Wishaw) was uniformly grand.&nbsp; And Javier Bardem&#39;s Silva is officially my favourite Bond villain, like, ever.&nbsp; He&#39;s evil, he&#39;s twisted, he&#39;s sometimes funny, and his opening scene is keyed perfectly.&nbsp; That scene will, in fact, stick with me all by itself.
&nbsp; There&#39;s also an argument to be made that this is a post-911 Bond.&nbsp; Sure, America&#39;s ten years from those attacks, and Bond is technically British, but in one way, the entire film is just a set-up for M&#39;s speech at Westminster.&nbsp; You&#39;ll see what I mean, I think, when you see it.
&nbsp; Go see it."

"event","Torchwood 5 is on hold - like ""ten or twenty years"", says Russell T Davies. And John Barrowman just joined Arrow - I haven't seen those episodes yet, but I think I'm going to like the show after all.  At the third one, it suddenly gets some quite good writing and starts playing with its potential. From ""Batman lite"" (though with killing) to something with a bit of bite.

And yes, I watch 'cause I'm a nerd.  But because I can't just shut my cultural-studies-brain off, I'm also watching to see what this show - about a rich, white-boy vigilante cleaning up his town by taking out the people preying on the poor - is doing politically.  Unsurprisingly problematic, it's nonetheless got some neat moments of self-reflective awareness."

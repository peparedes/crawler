"event","As I begin a new story of indeterminant length (the first couple paragraphs of which you can read in the previous post), I am reminded of the last story I started writing.  I didn't get any further than this (don't confuse this John with the one in Fire): 

As the morning sun streamed through the open window, John awoke to the sound of a lawnmower somewhere down the street. Turning to kiss his wife, he found that she was already awake. As he put on his pants, this became evident to him when he heard the whistle of the kettle boiling. He walked down the sunlit stairway and turned to see his wife drinking tea in the living room, gazing through the shades at the warm summer day outside. John walked up behind her and kissed her on the neck. Startled, she let out a timid laugh. Together they leaned toward the window and John reached at the string to raise the blinds. The skyline of the city was a sillhouette against the morning sun above it. Suddenly, a bird struck the window. John looked up and saw flocks of birds flying in all directions. He began to say ""thats odd"" when there was a blinding flash of light and the wind was knocked out of him. As his skin erupted into fire, John reached toward his wife. She did the same, and they held each other as the shockwave ripped apart their house, leaving their blackened corpses splayed on the ground amongst the rubble, just two bits of carrion rotting in the desert that had once been a suburb. As the smoke cleared, the gentle summer breeze returned and swept their ashes away.

In the dark basement of an abandoned school, John awoke in a cold sweat. The dream had returned as it had almost every night since that day. He heard the sound of helicopters overhead. A woman screamed and gunshots rang out in the distance. When they stopped, all that was left was the sound of a child crying. Gloria burst into the room screaming, ""They're coming! Let's run!"" John sprung up and searched for his equipment. ""Where's my pistol?"" he asked, concern and urgency growing in his voice. ""You're holding it, John. You always fall asleep with a gun in your hand."" John holstered his beretta and grabbed his backpack. Gloria handed him his rifle and they ran upstairs and outside. In front of the school, the elevated highway had been blasted off of its supports and lay before them as an impenetrable concrete wall. Behind them, they could hear the soldiers shouting and dogs barking. A line of burned telephone poles stood like willow trees along the access road, their broken wires swinging in the breeze. John took Gloria's arm and they ran down the line, between the rows of burned out cars, ghosts ships piloted by the dusty corpses of those lucky enough to have died in the blast. ""Get down!"" John yellled as a man burst from a house and ran across the street to the highway-wall. John and Gloria took shelter behind a rusted minivan as the man began his futile climb. He jumped and grabbed the first ledge and struggled to pull himself up. Just then, a helicopter rose from behind the row of houses. It steadied itself, aimed it's cannon, and the man dissapeared in a fiery conflagration. Gloria began to cry, and John slid himself next to her and leaned against the rusted wheel of the van. They waited there for what seemed like hours."

"event","John was a frail man, and at first the gasoline can had been almost too heavy for him to lift.  It was getting alot lighter now, though, which was a good thing because he was probably going to have to run the ten blocks back to the warehouse and he couldn't just leave something like that behind, not with his fingerprints all over it.  Fuck, John thought.  I should have worn rubber gloves.  ""Heh,"" he snickered as he realized that in a few minutes there wouldn't be any surfaces remaining on which fingerprints could be left.  John poured the last few drops of the gasoline out and set the can down at his feet.  She began to whimper again behind the duct tape which kept her from pleading for her life.  John said nothing.  He just stared into her eyes, waiting for the look, just one look that would make him stop everything.  In her eyes, though, he saw no guilt, no sadness, no remorse.  Nothing but fear.  The vain, shallow, selfish fear that one feels when they know that their life is about to end.  ""You ended my life a long time ago,"" John whispered.  John opened the oven and peered inside.  The points at which the charred remnants of what was once the soft supple flesh of a newborn child had cracked and fallen away revealed smooth, pearl white bone.  John could hear her sniffing and sobbing in her corner.  ""You don't get to cry,"" John said as an anger he hadn't felt since childhood overcame him.  ""You thought you could pretend it was mine?"" he asked, lifting the axe off the floor and raising it above his head.  ""You arrogant WHORE!"" he screamed as he brought the axe down onto the stove.  The hiss of natural gas grew apparent as he continuted swinging.  ""I hope you're proud,"" he said, turning, ""of..."" He stopped as his eyes met hers.  There was the look.  The look that, three days ago, might have ended this whole episode.  The look that, just yesteday, would have saved her child from eighteen hours at five hundred degrees.  The look of someone who has betrayed their only love, someone who feels such guilt, such remorse, that they no longer care whether they live or die.  Someone who, in a way, has already died inside, just as John died when he learned of her betrayal.  John saw this look and collapsed, crying, onto the floor.  He took a cigarette out of the crushed pack in his jacket pocket and rested it between his lips.  ""I love you,"" he said as he flicked open the cap of a red cigarette lighter.  He stared into her eyes as together they drew their final breath."

"event","I. As a young lad, in my travels, I once witnessed a peculiar ritual for drinking tequila.  Before swallowing a dram of the burning liquid the locals would lick salt from their hands, and afterwords would suck a slice of lime.  Recently, bored with my usual Gin I bought a bottle of tequila in the hope of better understanding this strange custom.  I opened the bottle and poured some of the pale gold spirit into a shot glass.  It smelled of barbecue sauce.  I quickly lifted the glass to my face and transfered the fluid to my mouth.  It burned and I swallowed quickly.  I repeated this again, displeased with the flavor of the beverage and wishing I had purchased a bottle of gin instead.  
II. Concluding that the spirit on its own was undrinkable, I poured: a shot of tequila into the glass and a small pile of salt into my hand.  I cut: a slice of lime.  I licked: the salt from my hand.  I drank: the tequila from the glass.  I sucked: the juice from the lime.  The result was smooth, easy drinking, and, in the end, rather flavorful.  I repeated: this several times and began to grow inebriated.  I poured another shot, another pile of salt, and began to cut another lime.  The knife was serrated and I should have anticipated that in sawing through the lime, in my drunken state, i would also saw into my hand.  I could not prevent this and winced in pain as the lime juice and salt seeped into the gash on my palm.  Streams of blood ran across my palm and between my fingers.  I licked them and the pain in my hand was numbed as my thoughts moved to the wonderfully rich flavor of my own blood.  
III. I poured: a shot of tequila into the glass, a generous serving of my blood into the tequila, and a pile of salt onto the wound on my hand.  I licked the sticky red salt from my burning hand and drank the tequila.  I don't know if it was the blood in the drink or the pain in my hand, whatever the cause, that shot of tequila tasted sweeter than any fruit I have had the opportunity to sample.  I continued this until the bottle and my veins were empty.  Utterly exhausted and thoroughly intoxicated from the liquor and the loss of blood, I drifted into sleep.  I never awoke."

"event","amid her verdant splendor i sit,
deliberating the course of my life,
in search of respite
some sort of repose, not from storm or strife
but from uncertainty
from aimlessness
from boredom
from great expenditures of energy
leading not to grand achievements
but delivering me, ulitmately, 
to the point from which I began this journey
upon the discovery of what seemed to me
the solution to life's uncertainty
I reflect and I begin to see
no more solutions than quandaries
this remedy which I so casually imbibe
this elixer, this tonic, this poison, this wine
at times allows me 
to escape the fetters of my insecurities
but alas, it proves to be
no more than a day pass 
which gives me leave 
to wander beyond the walls
of the prison of sobriety
but when I awake to face a new day,
I find my fears once more 
laying in bed next to me

i took a trip into the forest
to try to look for myself
my friend asked if he could come along
he said that he wanted to help
i told him that I had to go alone
for the man that I am seeking is unknown
even to myself, although I think I met him
in a dream last week
he said if i wanted to find him i should speak
to her, but the phone didn't work
and all the letters i sent went unanswered
and now I'm left at a four way intersection
trying to decide which direction would be best
but reflection fails to bring decision,
and now i've been standing here for a whole week
i don't sleep anymore, my vision blurred
and thoughts disturbed by doubt
i guess i found out one thing

"event","sometimes you feel like a nut sometimes you don't. right now i feel like a cashew. some guy in tampa is trying to ask me out. i dunno, tampa guys are weird. and i like someone else so that might be one of those things i should say not to. sucks cause the clickers says it's been 4 months and i'm starting to feel testy. ever noticed how easy it is to get pissed when you're not getting laid?  i got honked at today. that was nice. reminds me that i do look like a human and not a um dog sometimes. oh and the guy that works arcoss the street from me got my #. he's cute. he was leaning against my car and i was looking at him thinking hmmm he'd be fun to nibble on. but there again. i like someone else so where does that leave me?  hehe i was wondering why horny wasn't a current mood you could pick on here then i found out it was so i was like yes let's be horny tonight. i might be but it's been so long since i got any that i'm not sure what it feels like anymore. but one thought keeps running thru my brain. i need to get laid i need to get laid oh dear god i need to get laid. isn't getting laid a weird term? i mean does it mean you should just lay there? hmm who is doing all this laying? you know indiana jones and the lost ark? i could be dianna jones and the lost sex. yep it's been 2,000 years and  i need to get laid i need to get laid. no it's not that bad. you go numb after a while but then you see a cute sexy nighty and think if i were getting laid i could wear that. but i could wear it if i wasn't getting laid but then i'd be wearing it for me and when you need to wear cute stuff to keep your sex life w/ yourself interesting i think it takes a whole new disturbing turn. woody allen said don't knock masturbation, it's sex w/ someone i love. how true is that? i really do love me. i'm great. i don't get on my nerves too often, i don't talk when i don't feel like talking i don't have conflicting views w/ myself. wow i'm my perfect mate. where is this going? hmmmm james i miss you. and getting drunk w/ you and telling you weird things. do you know it's 4:30 in the morning? i should go to bed. thanks for reading this. goodnight."

"event","So the past few days have been pretty boring. remember the entry i wrote on how guys suck? well, this guy i've been talking to saw it and got all jealous. he's really cool and everything, but he lives so far away that i dunno if it's even worth trying cause what if we ruin a perfectly good friendship by fighting about distance? eh, this goes back to my whole point of relationships not being worth it right now. i mean, i see my friends that have them and on the surface they look great and i think gee i want that but then i think about it and really it's one big sacrafice. they give up friends and alone time and shit they want to do in consideration for this other person. they become their significant other and you can't seperate the identities. can't you be w/ someone and still be who you are or is the definition of love the total loss of self? eh now this is getting depressing. 
Things i want in a guy
1. someone who can make me laugh (and i don't mean just a goofy person. i mean someone who has the perfect balance of wit and sarcasm)
2. someone who gets my jokes and doesn't just think they're insults.
3. someone who reads (for fun) really just someone who is politically and socially aware (that doesn't mean knowing who camren diaz is dating this week)
4. someone who has a job and a car. i mean, i'm 20, guys my age SHOULD have these things right?
5. someone who doesn't need to be the stereotypical bad ass guy. if i wanted to date an asshole i could have done that a long time ago. on the same hand i don't want a pansy. i want someone who is emotionally strong enough to be independant but also strong enough to confide in me and let their guard down.

is this all too much to ask? am i fooling myself? maybe i should be a lesbian....if only i could get around the sex w/ a girl thing"

"event","I hate men (and if you are a male friend of mine that was not directed at you because obviously you're not a goddamn idiot). it seems that in the ""modern times"" of the internet male (and female) inteligence has dropped by of let's give a round about estimate of 75%. now it's ok for girls to have sex before marriage. you're not a slut if you've had sex so girls don't have the ""omg what if he tells his friends we had sex and people think badly of me"" mentality. so now we can fuck and there are girls who just want friends w/ benefits. ok fine let them be who they want to be. but now guys are used to these girls who want no strings attached sex so they want all girls to fuck w/o any real commitment. and there are these girls who thing gee if i fuck him maybe he'll see what a great person i am and how agreeable i am and stay around. so bam they have sex and he thinks it was a booty call and she's picking out wedding invitations and somewhere along the way communication was lost so he's a prick and she's a stalker. ok fine. so now the internet comes along and this is happening a lot more because we're meeting 500 people everytime we go into a chatroom and let's face it shy people are no longer shy on here and guys are willing to say things they wouldn't normally be willing to say because it's just a box full of words not a real person. so you IM someone (someone w/ the screen name like.......20forlando) and you go asl because it's the first thing that comes naturally. so the girl is like...you goddamn moron (because that's the 50th guy to say that in the last 5 mins) read my profile. so the guy thinks well what a bitch and what the hell is a profile? they've heard of this thing but if it involves reading something w/o the key words sex ass anal i'm willing to have a threesome w/ you and any girl you choose he's not interested. i understand that guys want to get laid. i really do. i'm not a guy and i want to get laid but i also want other things. like someone to sit next to me and watch tv or play some video games w/. and i'm not even asking the guy to accept me right when i get out of bed w/ my hair sticking up and no make up on because hey i've looked in the mirror in the morning and it ain't pretty but i want a guy who will call me up and i'll go hey i'm sick and he'll run over w/ a can of chicken noodle soup a few hours later (until that guy decides to play mind games then date the girl that has fucked at least two of his friends over) but really i'm not even asking him to heat it up in the microwave or hold my hand and take my temp. i'm just asking for a goddamn can of chicken noodle soup here. anyway i'm sure you're all calling the cops and telling them there's a crazy girl w/ a keyboard saying dangerous things so i'm going to give you a senario of what really pisses me off.
there's a guy...let's call him....oh....dick. and he IMs a girl let's call her....violet. he seems normal...doesn't even ask her asl or if she has a web cam or nude pics. so she thinks hey he might not be scum. she gives him her #. he calls. now let's remember that they've talked on the internet for like 3 hours before this. the fist thing out of dick's mouth is ""why don't you come over and spend the night, we won't do anything we'll just hang out"". now, i'd like to take a time out to point out WHY this is wrong. 
1. why the fuck can't you drive here asshole? what? too much WORK? why don't you say hey why don't i come see you?
2. what ever happened to the 1st date? you know, dinner, movie, akward conversation?
3. if a guy and a girl sleep in the same bed and they are attracted to each other physically when does sex or sex like acts not occur? 
ok so the girl says no let me get to know you a little better 1st...now at this point there is NO rejection just a rain check for a later date. acceptable answers from the guy would be
1. ok
2. i understand
3. ok
unacceptable answeres include
1. what you don't trust me?
uh no i don't i've known of your existance for a grand total of 3 GODDAMN HOURS!
2. oh come on are you scared?
yes, i don't know you, you're inviting me to the easiest place you can kill me and trying to antagonize me into doing something that makes me uncomfortable makes me see that you're not really worried about my comfort but my gain so now i'm thinking that if i did go spend the night w/ you i'd wake up naked and strapped to a cross w/ my lips sewn shut (that is a reference to a movie not something i pulled out of my ass)
3. basically anything besides ok.
so the girl, like an idiot keeps talking to this guy. and one night he tells her about a shitty relationship he had. she thinks ""great we're talking"" he thinks ""maybe she'll have pity on me and do me"" so she tells him about this bad relationship she had because GIRLS LIKE TO CONFIDE...IT'S WHY WE HAVE FRIENDS. she says ""i tried to stay on good terms"" he hears ""i'm trying to get back w/ him"" w/ equals no sex for said guy so he starts yelling about how dumb she is to want to stay w/ a loser. guys, just a tip IF YOU WANT TO FUCK US DON'T CALL US DUMB! and she goes "" i didn't say that"" at this point his brain has shut off because all he sees is a lost opportunity to get laid so he just keeps yelling. she hangs up because a. he's hurting her ear w/ all the yelling and b. he's yelling at a complete stranger for wanting to stay on good terms w/ someone. see, i used to be a firm believe in the good in everyone. now i'm beginning to wonder because the only guys this senario hasn't happened w/ are either just friends or gay. and damnit lesbianism isn't the way to go either because girls are just as fucked up. in general people suck and i'm really sick of this let down everytime i meet a guy. so meet a guy in real life you say? oh well then i get such comments as ""can i pee on you?"" or losers who want to mooch off me like i'm their mom. so i'm really ready to give up on people all together. blah i'm out of steam so i'm going to end it."

"event","i have finally learned trust. and, i am now willing to admit that i love daryn. for the past 62 hours i have gone thru the most hell i have in a long time. the last time i talked to daryn was 11 am tuesday morning. the convo goes:
me: hey i just took my drug test.
him: you're not going to have a prob passing are you?
me: nope haven't smoked weed in a long time. 
him: i'm trying to score.
me: what?
him: trying to score
me: drugs?
him: yeah
me: oh...
him: don't get mad at me i'm sick i need them to get thru the week
me: i'm not mad, it's you're decision i'm just hurt
him: i know, it's hard, i gtg call me in an hour

this was our last convo....now, i don't know what the readers in live journal land know about dealers but when your loved one is hunting for one and they don't call you and don't answer there phone start freaking out after the 1st 24 hours. so i did this. and today i started thinking, ok, realisticly maybe he just doesn't want to talk to me, and before i've been able to move on from a guy who was ignoring me, but w/ daryn that just HURT. i mean, i felt like...i don't want anyone else i'm not interested, even guy i used to flirt w/ i'm just like eh. i think, this is love. like marge simpson said ""there will be many crushes in your life that will let you down, but one day you'll love someone so much, it actually hurts"". she was so right. so, 1am on friday morning, my phone is in my room, im in the computer room. my phone starts ringing, and there was some kind of background noise so i didn't realize it at 1st but then it's like omg daryn. i go in to get it and it's him. over the weekend he was supposed to DT, he didn't. he told me he couldn't find any dealers so he's been DTing, and he sounds...horrible. but, not like sick, just defeated. he signed up for counseling....i can't even describe how it felt to talk to him. it's amazing. i dianna looney, the incurable flirt, has fallen in love. may god have mercy on us all"

"event","i debated about writing about this in here. but, since it's a major part of my life and if i don't write about it, it's gonna just be rambling crap so here we go. 2 weeks ago my whole ""allergic reaction"" thing started. i've been missing work shuffling around feeling like a zombie. not a pretty thing especially coupled w/ my face swelling and the moodiness from the meds. so all in all for 2 or 3 weeks now i've been feeling....shitty. 
then, wednesday night i get this call. it's from a 321 area code so i was like ""wft is someone calling me from a 321 area code"" then i answer. the voice on the other end asks if it's me so of course i say yeah who's this? ""daryn"". anyone remember in the ring where all that static is coming at you and then it's just silent. that's what it was like. static then BAM! it's daryn and everything is silent. 
now, i know some people (james) are going who the hell is daryn. and some people (amy) can't believe that have to hear this crap again. sorry amy, gotta let it all out or james will go crazy from the not knowing. 
last year i met daryn online. he was 23, gorgeous (ex model), and i absoulutly hated him. he was this jumpy bitchy person who thought he knew everything and tried to make me feel dumb. then i found out the real kicker, this guys an adict. and we're not just talking go to NA meetings once a week got the white keychain (i think that's the one you get when you've been sober for 5 years, yes i've been to the meetings, no not for me) recovering but pretty much ok adict. oh no i came into his life just as he decides to get serious about quiting. 
ok so i'm talking to him, we're friends nothing serious. he gets sick we talk, he throws up, we talk. and oddly enough, i begin to like him. i mean yeah he's bitchy and feelin yucky all the time. but the real him starts to shine thru. he's so sweet and funny and he does this little head shake and rolls his eyes and pouts then smiles...it's...amazing how little things like that make you feel like your heart just stopped. so one night i'm hanging out w/ dawn and i get this call. it's daryn and he's telling me how he might go back to england and how this will be the best thing for him and i feel like someone has put a huge stone on my chest and it's broken my chest cavity and i can't breathe and my heart is like all not beating and i get mad and go ""damnit you can't leave"" and he's going on about how he should and i'm sitting in the parking lot of a publix in oveido freezing my ass off and i just go ""no, i'm in love w/ you."" so everything goes dead silent. then he goes ""come stay the night"" just in this calm sweet way. and i'm still pissed off so i'm like why should i go there? and he sounds all hurt and goes ""i'll make you dinner"" and i realize that this guy doesn't want to fight me and he's doing his best to apologize w/o saying he's sorry. so i go ok and i go over there the next day. we just kinda chill and everything, his son was there (he's so cute!). and later on we go to bed and it's so cool. i try to roll away and he's like no you're too far (in a full size bed) and just... everything that night was so amazing. (side note: i've come to realize that the majority of my friends think i've been around the block quite a few times. i haven't, the number of guys i've been w/ i could count on 1 hand and the number of guys i've dated i could count on 2. i'm outgoing, took me a long time to get that way, but outgoingness doesn't equal slutiness) anyway! so the next morning i'm like....on cloud 9. the birds are singing the trees are green, the sun is shining and for once i appreciate that fact. then, 2 weeks go by. we talk on the phone, but he's acting all shady. then he calls me one night and he's relapsed, so we fight. and this has pretty much been the cycle. he calls, everything is ok, he relapses, we fight. the last time we just kinda stopped talking because he was going thru dts and felt pretty shitty so we never got to talk. then, 4 months later i get this call. so i'm like, why are you calling me? and he goes, i'm like a stray dog. i keep coming back. so i say ""well stray dogs always want something when they come around be it food shelter or just affection"" and he says ""well, i have food and shelter"". and we talk for hours. i love him. i don't say that about a lot of people. i may think it, but i don't go around broadcasting that i'm in love. too much hurt just waiting to happen. but, he's locked in a room right now, going thru w/drawals, and....i do love him. i feel like crying now, i felt like crying 2 days ago when he called."

"event","last night i went and saw underworld which rocked a donkeys butt so hard the donkey got a lil excited. so if i do the gothy thing for the next 7-14 business days please understand, i'm not sane and i live in america where we young children are very impressionable to the movies we see. but look on the bright side, at least i havent decided to copy the texas chainsaw massacres ....yet.....hehehehe oh you're still here? annnnnnnnnnnnyway! i went shopping w/ my mom and aunt today. i got a spiffy new outfit that i now need somewhere to wear. i got home and no one was here so i decided that i was cold and tired so i took a nap. i had a creepy dream about my house and how it was dawn's grandparents and they left it to her when they moved to colorado. it was sooooooo pretty. it was 3 stories and it had a huge porch on the front and you walked in the front door into the foyer (i had a foyer!) and the sitting room was off to the left and you went down the hall to the right and there was the kitchen. there were two hallways along the front part of the house (so combined the three looked like a capital T) if you went to the left you would find dawns's room on the left side of that hallway and a storage room on the right and if you turned to the right you would find my room on the right and an alternate route to the kitchen on the left. in the main hallway there were stairs to the second floor and on the left was the dining room. anyway, the house was really neat but it was creepy as hell. the grounds were huge so we weren't near any road but, one night i heard someone walking around so i got up the nerve to sneak a peak out the window and saw a guy walking a dog. not just any dog, a big ass pit bull. so of course being the logical person i went to dawn's room, woke her up, and asked if her grandparents hired a security person to watch the house. she was like wtf and the scene switched. it was raining and my family came to visit. we were standing in the kitchen and i told them about the guy w/ the dog. they told me i was just dreaming. they kept leaving the back door open which freaked me out for some reason. i walked into my room and my window was open and all this rain was pouring in so i started freaking out, ran back to the kitchen of course everyone had left and left the damn back door open so i closed and locked it and ran to wake dawn up again (poor girl) i ran into her room and said her name and she looked behind me and screamed. then i woke up. needless to say, after that i wasn't going back to sleep lol. oh! skylar (dawn's cat) is in heat! isn't it amazing that a 2 month old cat is in heat. of course she's probably not really cause she acts nothing like a dog when they're in heat. because we all know how much dogs and cats are alike. they have.....four legs.....and fur....and uh noses and eyes! (for those of you who do not understand sarcasm, dianna has taken a moment to make fun of someone near and dear to her. please do not send her informative pamphlets or links to the vetinary digest website, she knows when a damn cat is in heat, it's when the boy cats start doing the girl cat. thank you). so i'm thinking it's all bad cause my cats are doing it on the kitchen floor, but then i think of amy...well, not when i see the cats doing it.....well actually i do because she has to listen to ally whine and have the cat flirt w/ her everytime she tried to feed her and i think ""cats are evil. what moron decided to domesticate them"" i mean, sit back and think of this hypothetical situation. bob has just buried the newly dead king in the sand to bake for a few days and he's taking a break under a palm tree when this little fuzzy creature runs by. he thinks ""wow that thing embodies the essence of the gods"" . so he grabs the thing, takes it to the new king, tells him his theory and the king thinks wow, bob is pretty smart, i'll promote him from dead king burier to sacrafice at the dead kings burial (for those of you that don't understand what i'm talking about, please visit your local library and look up mumification and ancient egyptian religion). so bob is having mixed feelings because 1. he'd been standing in the sun for 4 hours when he got this bright idea about the cat and 2. he's gonna die now. see, and there again is my point. cats are bad, cats kill. and this didn't just end in ancient egypt. around the world today millions of people own cats, and some not just one. oh no some people have to own 3 of the little bastards. 3 cats that climb curtians and pee on the floor in front of the littler box, i mean RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT! WHAT THE HELL? ARE YOU TOO DAMN LAZY TO TAKE ONE MORE STEP?! AND HOW THE HELL DO THEY KEEP GETTING IN MY ROOM? THE DOOR IS CLOSED THEY MUST BE GODS...WAIT...BOB WAS RIGHT! MAN AND HERE I WAS THINKING BOB WAS CRAZY....I'M GOING TO EGYPT RIGHT NOW TO TALK TO HIM....ONLY HE HOLDS THE KEY TO GETTING RID OF THE DEMON CATS. AHHHHHHHH(beeeeeeeeeeeep....we're sorry dianna has temporarily lost her sanity and has been given a niiiiice shot to make her all happy and sleepy, don't worry folks a few days in the nuthou...i mean w/ a few days rest dianna will be assimilated...uh .....normal again, thank you.)"

"event","Flames of green 
sweep over the night sky
when the stars look at your future
they kneel down and cry

lying dead in a puddle
blood washes over stone
you finally got your wish
of just being left alone

a maze never ending
this life seems to me 
all you ever look for
nothing you want to be

forever is a lonely word
when all you have is this
all you ever wanted
was for it to make a little sense

ocean of time sweep you away
and there is nothing of earth
your dreams only disappear
like driftwood in the surf"

"event","Friday night i went to this local concert thing at hard rock live in the exciting citywalk located at univeral. please visit our snazzy night club the groove to dance the night away then go get drunk at margaritaville where the clocks are always set at 5. have a couple of rounds w/ jose quirvo (sp?) then head over to the boat ride to get sea sick and throw up over every part of universals amazing (man made) lake front property. Then, take the 10 mile senic hike back to the parking and finally play bumper cars on the way out. ok i'm over it. we were in the club right and i was standing next to the pit and this big strong sexy omg omg omg guy was standing in front of me taking all the blows from people who got knocked out of the pit so everything was chill right? till some guy like 400 times his size trips over his shoe and comes careening towards us so bam hot guy steps on my foot bangs my hip and takes out dawns left boob. i grab my shoe and run off to the bathroom cause now i need water and i have to pee in a serious way (hey 500 pounds of flesh comes at you you get a little scared) anyway as i'm walking down the stairs to the bathroom this group of guys is coming up and the last one in the line just grabs my crotch! i was like in shock. all these thoughts go through my mind (was he drunk? can he get me alcohol? was he cute?) anyway we decide to leave and head for home cause well we couldn't take anymore screaming.
     so i met this guy online and in my quest to find a normal guy on the internet i invited him over to watch a movie. omg he's so sweet. we WATCHED the movie and he gave me a sweet back massage (id recommend him) and aw he kept rubbing my back and hugging me and he kissed me when he left. BIG SMILES. he's a keeper lol. 
     ok so i could use some really thoughtful advice on a matter. i know everyone is going to say that ""a college education is so important"" but look at this from my point of view. I HATE going to school. i HATE all my classes. i mean, i like what i'm learning in them but i HATE being at school. you guys have no idea. when i come home i want to be able to chill and have my time to myself not study and do homework. i don't even want to BE anything professional. i want to be a housewife or work somewhere where i don't have to think about it when i go home. i found my old journal from back in like 9th grade. do you know what i wanted then? ""I don't want anything great in life. just a husband, two or three kids, a house in a middle class neighborhood, a reliable car or two (they don't have to be new) and a dog"" you know, i still want the same thing now. even a year after i've been out of highschool a year to find myself that's STILL what i want. i'm so sick of people asking why i bough a chevy and not a toyota, why i don't do this or that. i mean. i'm not out to look good to other people. if i wanted friends i'd be nice. i went to school to get everyone off my back. i know that they're trying to help me and they want me to have a better life. i mean my mom didn't even graduate high school. she got married at 15 had a kid by 16 and she hasn't been free since. i'm stronger than her. i graduated high school i got a job and am buying my own car. i won't marry a guy because he's cute i'll always do things my own way. but, i'm sick of making myself miserable to make everyone else happy. i think about school and i want to cry. i was never happier than the year i was out of school. did any of you know me to be that happy in high school? so i guess i'm seriously thinking about dropping out and paying my parents back for all my stuff. i can't be like this anymore. it's not the classes. i'm not a slacker or whatever. the work isn't like a problem. i just feel like there's this weight on my chest and i hate it."

"event","I told you I'd put my autobiography on here but I left the disk in the car so I guess your sol til I get time at home to put it on. hmmm so this guy i was talking to a few months back emailed me like a month ago and told me he wanted to talk again so I was like whatever and called him. I asked if he has a gf now and he goes yeah........kinda. so wtf right? you kinda have a gf? what does that mean? anyway so I was all nice and he goes call me tomorrow. so  I called him again last night and he goes ""well, let's talk but I'm not breaking up w/ this girl yet"". so, is he trying to punish me? break me down and make me feel really guilty for sleeping w/ someone else when we weren't even officially going out? The thing is I kinda did feel bad about sleeping w/ someone else (key word did) but after he started this crap about ""let's talk"" I'm beginning to see the whole punishment thing. hmmm anyway I would appreciate some guy reading this and translating the guy speak so I can figure out what is going on w/ kris. anything else? Dawn's sister got tickets to a concert tonight and I've been cordially invited. I'm so tired I'm falling asleep at the school computer (dude it's a dell) but I'm going to go tonight rock out and sleep the rest of the weekend. Amy do you read this thing? and what about you Cindy? you two need to write in here fer sher. we need to know all your problems too! 
ok off to kill time til class."

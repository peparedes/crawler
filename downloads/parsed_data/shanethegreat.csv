"event","<small>you think everything is cool shit.
then you find something out.
and BAM! you're life is a mess.
how it happens? who knows.
but i dont know what i'm going to do.
it makes me mad.
and i love how i'm always the last person to find out everything.

i'm just blah.
maybe i'll lay down.
rummage through my thoughts and see where it gets me. 
i guess its hard when everything is so cluttered.
sometimes i dont know where to start.
and i dont know where i left off.

later.

Shane Kippel here.
Checking out this whole livejournal deal.
Its quite interesting.
Dea was like 'OMG SHANE YOU SHOULD GET ONE!!!!1111oneoneone' 
All fan girl like. So I gave in!
What can I say. She's a powerful young woman.
RAWR. LOL.
I dont have much to say about myself.
But I'm thinking about getting another tattoo.
I've got my TV on mute.
And its the GRILLZ song. HAHAHA.
Its great to just watch the videos on mute.
My AIM is <b>DrumThis86</b>
IM me sometime, I'm always up for a good chat. 
If I'm on.
Well tonight I'm going out with a few of my friends.
And we'll see what happens.

Catch You Later.
Shane."

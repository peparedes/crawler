"event","It is so weird to think that my first year has already past by. It seems like it was only recently when I walked into my dorm room and absolutely despised it, that feeling never changed, I will have to say I will not miss that dorm again! Lol. The loud noises, lack of sleep, people singing in the hall all the time, only girls, and not to mention the whole slamming of the door every five seconds. Yep I will not miss that place ever again, but I will miss my roommate and suitemate. They are one of the reasons I did not go stir crazy while in Huntsville. 

 

Of course the main reason I didnt go crazy was Devin. Although, first semester did offer our relationship quite a roller coaster I should say, but in the long run I believe it made our relationship only stronger and I could not be happier with anyone else. Actually, I couldnt imagine being with anyone else but him, and I know he loves me the same. I cant wait until we can start our lives together and look forward to planning a wedding and life with him.

 

I use to think that friendship was stronger than family bonds. I guess it went along with that saying you can pick your friends but you cant pick your family. It was this year I realized that my family will always be there for me, and my friends, well, just wont. Of course there are those few friendships that you know will always be there, but to me I think of them like family and those people should know who they are. It was hard to realize that many of my friends in high school, whether they are still there or have graduated, werent in any way shape or form there for me this year. I tried to keep in touch with some, but they would only brush me off as if I was nothing, but its not too important to me anymore. Besides half of the people I used to hang out with in high school I dont talk to so in the long run Ill save money on wedding invites! Lol. 

 

There was also so much that happened between some of my friends and my family. A lot of people I know have gotten engaged, had a kid (i.e. my sister), or have gotten married. Granted a lot of these things just made me jealous mostly due to the fact I want to be with Devin so much and we have put more time and energy into our relationship than some of my friends so obviously I would have a twinge of jealousy.still do! Lol but its all good. It will all work out in time! Hopefully sometime within the next year!

 

In all this year has been alright, yes I wish I couldve done better in some classes but Nicole told me that I did relatively good compared to most freshman which makes me fill alright. But this post is getting a bit long and it is very doubtful anyone will read it except a few so later yall!"

"event","well I was going through some of my notebooks and came across my theory on the elves and leperchauns, some of you may be aware of this already. SO here it is....

Elves and leperchauns are both highly advanced beings who at one point could, in fact, have been relatives. My esteemed collegue (aka my boyfriend, Devin) and I have different viewpoints on this matter. I for one believe they could have lived together as a family but the leperchauns had gotten tired of a particular leperchaun, Weeve, who, instead of teaching of mishap and evil magic, he was teaching kindness and using their magic for the greater good. Many leperchauns began believing Weeve and tried to start a union, but the king of leperchauns, King Leper, was angry about this and forced all the leperchauns who were a part of this union out. These leperchauns left the colony with nothing. There were approx. 100 of them who left. 

Weeves tried to calm the outcasts of the colony but many were frightened by not knowing what they were going to do. Weeves then went out to think by himself for a couple of days. It was during this time when he met a jolly old man who, at first, was shocked by seeing a leperchaun. He talked with Weeves for a while and was amazed with his personality. St. Nick had never met a nice, giving leperchaun before. He had met his relatives before, and thought they were the worst possible creatures on the entire planet. When Weeve told his of his 100 followers, St. Nick began to formulate his plan. He asked that Weeve and his followers come with him to help him make toys for good children in the North Pole. Weeves was extremely happy about his offer and he went right away to tell the others they had a great place to go. All of them were estatic about their good fortune. After years of living in the North Pole the leperchauns changed their name to Elves this way they would never be associated with them in any way ever again. Not only did their name change, but they also began to develope their own style in clothes. Lastly their general look began to change. 

In conclusion elves and leperchauns were in fact related to each other. You can see the facts at www.elvechauns.edu/history."

Well all I know is if the adjustment to everything in life is going to take this long I don't want to be part of anything else. Also people keep telling me to get involved. It's hard to have the motivation to get involved when you are so freakin tired because you don't get any sleep at all because people in your dorm don't know how to NOT slam doors every five seconds and don't know how to SHUT UP! It's sad when the only way to get sleep is to go over to your bf dorm after class to take a nap. And that is precisly what I have to do. It's rediculous to have to put up with this. I am spending a thousand something dollars on a dorm so I can't get sleep, have no peace and quiet, and be treated like a five year old. On weekdays we are only allowed to have guys in our rooms until 11:00. This is dumb. I guess the people who decided this rule thought people can only have sex during the day. Right, whatever. I'm sure there are millions of people who don't. So this serves as no purpose. Perhaps they believe by enforcing this the noise would not be that loud. Hmmmmm, nope. Of course I have already established that. So it is with all this and so much more I hate it. What more you ask. Well my grades suck, I still don't know anyone (and if ANYONE tells me it's because I'm not getting involved...bite me). Because I already established that too. I guess the friend thing isn't all that different than in Katy. It's not like a had a load crap of friends there either. All in all I just hate it here. There is absolutly nothing to do in huntsville. The only thing I hear is about parties and getting ""wasted"". And anyone who knows me, know I believe alcohol is the most vile grotsque thing on the planet and wish never to be apart of that lifestyle. Oh did i mention my grades. Yeah they suck BIG time. I've never gotten a C before in my life, and look here I got 20! Yay me! Maybe I should just drop out get a job at McDonalds and call it a day. Lord knows I'd do better there then here. Well maybe not. I could just be that stupid. Who knows. Maybe if I actually changed my majopr to something I love it would be better. Oh to sing again....but yeah I don't want to work my butt of for something I know I won't have a future in. So why bother. I was never that great at it anyways, so I guess I need to just let it go. Besides there's no point."

But what was cool was Victor said Devin could work seasonal with me. Yay!!! It was actually kinda sad when I left. I got along with retty much everyone there and in the most part liked working there. But I suppose I'll still see some of them in December. I doubt everyone will still be there, but some will. 

Now I only have 10 day to move to college. I'm excited! A little nervous now too. I'm glad Nicole will be there. Now I might actually see her more than once a couple of months. lol. I suppose I'll see her everyday and follow her around and ask her a million questions and.... jk Nicole. I promise I won't to do that and you now have that in writing. or typing or whatever. As for a job there.... My Dad nows someone who is opening a linin store so he says he will try to pull some strings and let me work there. Now a linin store doesn't seem that great but hey if it pays I'm game! He's also going to see if Devin can work there too. It should be interesting.

"event","Well I've been thinking alot lately about mainly just college and Krystal and her good for nothing, pain in the neck, soon to be my brother-in-law, fiance. First I shall start with the college things in which I have been contemplating on.

Well first off I chose my major to be psychology just for the fact I find that the most facinating subject. Ok not the most facinating but I'm really interested in that subject. The only thing is I have to take soooo many freaking science classes. And lets face it I'm no where near a genious in fact I would qualify me as an idiot before anything else. Yeah sure I did alright in hs, but not that great. Being number 222 doesn't seem great to me anyway. I think that's what I was neways. Not only that but I enjoy singing a heck of alot more than pych. So why not do that you ask....I just don't think I'm good enough! I know ppl say I am, but who would really tell their family member/friend that they suck at singing and that theyy have no future in it what-so-ever. Nobody I know(if I did I would find them rude and wouldn't really want to their friend). But seriously who would tell someone that?!?! But not only that about the whole singing thing, but how many ppl love to sing and try to go for and how many people actually suceed? Not very many I'll tell you that. Not only do I enjoy singing more than pych. but I also looooove to write. So why not be a english major you ask. Well frankly I like to write fictional stuff and poetry. I could probably do journalism, but Nicole told me that department totally blows. Besides I'm not sure I would that great of a writer for the news. Sounds kinda dull. But as for writing other stuff....so much fun. On top of that I still have no idea what my minor is going to be. 

The second topic on my mind is Krystal and Justing (the bafoon!). So I call Krystal today and she is crying off the wazoo. So of course I figured it had to do with Justin so I ask her what was wrong. And boy was I right. Firstly she was mad because if Krystal is tired and wants to rest freakazoid gets mad at her and screams at her. I mean come on she pregnant of course she's going to need to rest. Then I guess he is saying he is picking up after her all the time now. I seen their apt. I highly doubt that he picks up anything. Then he isn't there for Krystal at all with all her medical stuff. Lately she has been getting nosebleeds alot. So she had to go to the doc yesterday and they actually burnt the inside of her nose. I don't know about yall but that's gotta hurt! And Justin didn't help her out at all. He didn't even go to the doc with her. Then she had to go again today and Justing wasn't working but did he go. Noooooooo. He's a freak and I want to hit him. Oh and that's not even the end of it. Another thing he did which pissed both me and my mom off was Justin actually asked that their kid gets a DNA test that way he knows it's his! I mean honestly. Who's else would it be?!?! I swear if I was alone with him for one sec he wouldn't be able to hear now more for a month! arg! I feel so bad for Krystal I told her she should come stay over here for a little bit. All I know is if she is already sick of him now how on earth are they going to make it? And yes Nicole I know you thought it is a bad idea if they got married and you know what I'm not ashamed to say it, you're right! 

Well I'm glad I got all that off my chest. Feel a little better. Till next year. lol jk. Hasta."

"event","Well I decided to update once again. Not that anything really exciting has happened. I still work at Tommy and yes I still don't find it all that enjoyable. The only thing good about it is the fact that I like almost all the people there. I went up to huntsville today to straighten everything out with my financial aid and do you wanna know what they needed. My mom freaken name to be added to the people who I live with. I mean why in tarnations did they make us go up there just to add that. So dumb. Anyways we also gave Nicole's b-day present to her. In case everyone isn't aware her birthday was the 27. We got her a dvd player. She also wore a sticker which said ""I am the sister of a wonderful and thoughtful person"" of course meaning moi! jk lol.Well that's about it for now. Later"

"event","Well I had to go to work today from 5-close. I finally learned how to use the freakin cash register. I've only been working there for four monthes but oh well. At least it was in my lifetime that they finally decided to train me on the stupid thing. Now for other news on work. The manager that does the scheduling hates me I swear! She scheduled me to work today- sunday. Ok now that's good right? Well it would be if she didn't have me close every freakin day! So I decided I'm not going in on friday because that's my entire spring break wasted. I know I know the whole money thing. Well I want a life too. And that is rediculous.  

My mom said she wants to try to go to Keema for easter weekend. It sounds good to me. I don't mind it. I just think she may be going overboard. I mean between the NY trip and all my other senior things I don't want her to waste all her money on me. I'd rather just wait till this summer to do something. I really want to rent a cabin at a lake for a week. If we do that hopefully Devin could come. Hopefully! Well that's about it for today. Adios."

"event","Well I got it yall, and it didn't even take a whole day to find it. I'm excited. It's a very nice elegant dress. Simple but pretty. I love it. Not to mention it didn't cost an arm and a leg. The place I got this from the lady who worked there was very fixated on me tanning. I tell you I was a little affended. JK. But I do think I'm going to take her advice for doing that and maybe attempt to tan. Yes it's very odd for me to do that, but hey it could be fun (gags). Lauren wasn't able to go because her softball game didn't get canceled like we thought it was and neither did Sarah's cousin so it was just us and our mothers. It was fun though. 

I went over to my dad's house later. It was fun. Krystal and Justin were there. I like how my song is turning out. It's very cool. I can't wait till it's all done. Maybe if I'm lucky I can perform it for Night of Stars. Hey Nicole you think you're going to be able to go? It's on a thursday night. I know weird right? I don't know the exact date though. I'll have to get it later. I'd figured maybe if I ask on this you might get back to me. lol. You know one thing that sucks about night of stars this year.....you can only do one act! I hate it. It sucks. Cause some of my friends want me to do an act with them but I'd rather do a solo. But oh well what can you do? Well I guess I'll type more later. Hasta Luego."

"event","Well Spring Break has finally come. Yay!!!!!!!!! Sarah came on Saturday but then she left on Sunday. She was supposed to come back monday but she decided she didn't like me that much so she stayed at her aunts house...figures. I'm the one who invited her here and then she leaves after one day. Oh well. We are supposed to meet back up again tomorrow to look at prom dresses. Fun stuff. I'm excited. Lauren is also going to go with us. Me and her hyaven't hung out since....dang I can't even remember. lol. Oh how the world turns....

Well I finally looked at my music for today. I gotta tell you Mr. D is on crack if he thinks we can learn those two 10 min. pieces in a week. One of them is in German. Not to mention the cd he gave us to learn off of doesn't really help us learn the song. It sucks. He said if we didn't learn those pieces by mon. then we won't be going on the trip. All I have to say about that is yeah right. He has no authority to do that. And I know he can't do that or else parents will go postal and strangle him. Not literally but I know he can't do that. 

The trip to NYC looks like it's actually going to be a blast. I'm soooo excited. Not about the whole flying thing though. The flying thing kinda sucks. I hate flying. My mom said to get some tylenal because it will help me sleep on the plane. Shoot I want a tranquilizer. Knock me out please!!!!!!! lol. Well that's about it for now. Peace!"

I just so happened to get chosen, but did I actually get to enjoy the fact that I actually got some recognition? Of course not! Why on earth would I get to do that when everyone seemed to give me such grief about the thing. Honestly it pissed me off. What really angered me though was my supposed ""be friend"" Abbie got the worst freakin attitude with me when she found out about the ensemble. She didn't find out until the day we rehearsed in class because she's always absent and she gave me a look to kill. Then she said when I went back to the risers ""Yeah and he doesn't choose favorites"". Whyat a.....I'm not going to say it. But then he picked another ensemble to sing a verse in Away in a Manger and while he was saying people's names Abbie said ""Melody"" in a very degrading way. Oh it pissed me of so much. I wanty=ed to smack her so hard! Then I was like did you say my name and she was just like Oh I thought he was going to pick you. Jerk! He didn't pick me just for the fact I was already in a ensemble that was singing a couple of songs. He did chose her though. When she went up there I was like good maybe now you can stop griping about me getting something for once! Arg people irritate me. Can't stand her anymore that's for sure. Dumb blond. Well what else has been going on. Oh I got a job at Tommy Hilfigure. I get 7.00 a hour and a 50% discount. Which is cool. I like that. Then I found out my sat score. I got a 1090. I wasn't too happy about it, but Nicole said that was good so I guess I'll take her word for it. My mom and I went shopping for food for Thanksgiving. Which Nicole is coming to. If she doesn't I will kidnap her. So just make it easier on yourself and me and come on your own please. Well that's about it for now. It's been real. Later."

"event","Well as usual the first week is very boring for school. The majority of my teachers seem pretty cool. Everyone that I know said I got the best physics teacher which is good. As for the new choir directors. The girl doesn't say too much but she isn't directing the choir I'm in, but she seems ok. Not very talkative though. The guy on the other hand.....hmmmmm. I don't like him. He seems to think that we are stupid and are in some sort of anatomy class instead of choir. On Thursday we spent like 30 minutes learning how to do something we all know how to. HOW TO STAND WHEN WE SING! 30 minutes. Arg! Then on firday we spent the entire class period warming up to go to our next period class. His warm ups by the way are dumb. They don't warm my voice up in the slightest. Thank God Devins going to be in that class starting Monday. Hopefully we stat to actually warm up to sing a song then too! Imagine that. Here are my other classes I'm taking besides physics and choir.

Sociology: The teacher is really cool and I think it's going to be a really fun class.

Pre-Cal- teachers nice but she tends to over explain certain things which I guess will be ok when we get to harder stuff.

English- least favorite teacher. Mrs. Obrien. She seems very stricted.

Speech- Hate speaking in front of classes, but I think the teacher is cool. 

lastly Eco- Can;t say I'm going to like the class. The teacher is actually kinda annoying. The people in the class should make it interesting though

Those are all my classes for this semester, Next semester I won't have as many unless I decide to go into creative writing like I want to. Hopefully the teachers I don't like will loosen up or something as the year goes on. As for choir I'll just have to see."

"event","Well as you can probably guess I am bored out of my mind. I may be going crazy from it, only time will tell. Today I didn't do much. Around 1 I went to my church with my mom to see what was going on there. They were giving free school supplies out to people who needed it. They had alot going on there too for kids such as: face painting, hair cuts, a moon walk, the youth room had a pool table, basketball, some other game (not sure what it was), there was food, and a bunch of other stuff. When we got there they said that they gave out over 200 things of school supplis and still counting. So it was really good. After that I went to wal mart to bring back a pair of jeans I got there so I can get another pair somewhere else that I liked alot better. Then we went home. On that was different was Nicole came over on a spurr of the moment type of thing. It was cool. I got to listen to he and my mom debate on some stuff. Although at some parts I just wanted to throw something at them. I swear them too could've went on all night, but Nicole left at 8 so they were unable to. But that weas about all that happened today."

"event","Today was good. I couldn't sleep for anything in the world so I was tired the majority of the day. My mom woke me up at 5:30 am! Oh so mad I had finally gotten to sleep then she had to go in the living room and make coffee. I know if I could sleep in my room it could solve some problems, but that's out of the question. it would be really nice to actually be able to sleep in my own bed. It would be ALOT more comfortable that's for sure. 

I had to take my mom to work at 9 because her van is still dead. Luckily, it's getting picked up tomorrow to get fixed. A couple of people from her work are going to pay for it to get fixed. So glad. One bad thing though, now MY car is acting up. Arg!I talked to my dad today about it and he said it's probably the battery.So, he's going to look at it Saturday. Lordy! When will it end?!?!?!?! Hopefully it's nothing really bad that can;t be fixed for a while cause school starts wednesday. 

At 9:30 I went to pick up Devin to go to school for choir council. Which was ok. Kinda boring. We did alot of refiling and moving things around in the back room. We went to eat lunch at Katy mills at 12. I had a strawberry-banana smoothie. Gotta love it! Except Devin didn't like it. Odd person. We went back to finish up some things in the choir room. Then we also had a little meeting. We talked mainly about how to get choir unity this year. Also about the first party for choir which is on the 20th.

After council me and Devin went to hang out at my apt. Today is exactly 6 monthes that we've been going out. Yay!!! And still counting. Yay!!!Hopefully it lasts for many many many many many more monthes as Devin puts it. lol. We pretty much just watched tv and ordered pizza. It was fun. Love ya Joe. 

My mom had some good news today. My dad is finally moving stuff out of the shop. The trailer is off the property. This helps alot. Also she has two people who want to look at the house she has listed. There is something else but I forgot. So it's going pretty good right now (knock on wood). I guess this concludes everything. Later everyone!!!!"

"event","Today was boring for the most part. I woke up around 10 and noticed a little gray cat that decided to chill at our apt till about 4. She was a sweat cat. I named her smokie. Alot nicer than the devil cat I have. That darn cat attacked my feet about 30 minues ago! I threw that thing outside. Stupid thing. Arg! 

My dad's birthday was Fri. He was a little upset at the fact only 2 ppl called him which were me and one of his friends Mark. I felt a little sorry for him. But I went over there today and I even baked a cake. Yes I baked the cake. Thank you very much. I didn't even burn down the apt or nething. Amazing. But I have no idea how it tasted. Oh well. I got my dad the Borne Identity movie. It also came with a pass to see the new one which he wants to see so I thought it was a good gift. We watched it when I was over there. A very good movie.

Well that's about it for now. Peace."

We went to Casadores. It was actually pretty fun really. After that me and Devin went to the mall and walked around it. A blast always.......let me tell ya!lol.jk. It was alright. We didn't see anybody we knew. Except Devin, he saw someone. Never seen the guy myself but that's usually how it goes. Then we went to my house and chilled. Watched tv mostly. My mom got home not too long after we got back and then I had to go take Devin home. I rented Butterfly Effect on the way back. It was alright me and my mom watched it. But that's about it for today.

"event","Well today started out very boring. I got up at about 12 and the maintenance guy was here fixing our hot water heater. It took them forever. Then they finally left so I was actually able to take a shower and get ready for the rest of the day. Me and my mom left around 7:00 to the mall so I could get Krystal some presents. I decided to get her a bunch of little things. So far I got her some bath stuff, a frame thing-a-ma-jig, a card, and some other little things. That's about all I did today. Tomorrow will be more exciting."

"event","Today was in one word long. Having to wake up early on summer vacation so you can go to school is a bummer. Darn Choir Council! I had to wake up at 8 got ready then I checked my oil before I left. Which was a really good idea because my engine would've went kapoowee if I wouldn't have. Then I went to pick up Devin, and then I forgot to pick up Rachel. Whoops! Luckily her mom took off work so she had a way to get there. Note to self:pick up Rachel tomorrow! Then we went to school so we have a blast organizing everything in the choir room. We first have to take all the costumes (like more than 100) and reorganize them by what musical they were in. That took a loooooong time. It probably would have went faster if it wasn't for the fact that everyone had no idea what costume went with which musical. Everyone had to ask Mrs. Yunker about every piece of clothing there was. I don't see how on earth she remembers. Then we went to lunch at Cici's around 11:30. Mr. Nance and Mrs. Yunker payed which was nice of them. I didn't get to play checkers though. That would've made things more fun there. When we got back we had to empty all the slots and throw away all the copied music. That took a while too. Me, Devin, Neely, and Rachel took a little break to go down to Devin's pre-cal teacher to see if he passed. He did! Very happy he was. I would be too if I were him. Then we went back to the choir room. At one point I think I scared Devin a little. He and James were talking about football and some different teams. Then I shouted No it's all about the Rockets. The face he made was priceless. For the record everyone I am fully aware of the fact that the Rockets are in fact a basketball team. We finially got to leave around 2:30 which was only 30 minutes before we were scheduled to work till. I think council will be ok. Some very interesting new people are in it. Hopefully it will be fun."

"event","Alright today was ok, kinda boring. I had to wake up at like 5:30 to get ready to sing at graduation. I had to be up at the school at 7:30, and I went to pick up Devin before I went to the school. We got to the school a little early. Then we practiced the song we had to sing a few times. At eight we left for graduation. When we got there we had to check the sound and stuff. Then we got to sit there for an hour for the stupid thing to start. Alex decided to build a little box for himself out of the folders we were using with our music in them. That kept him occupied for a while. Everyone else just sat in the lobby and talked. We sang after the salutatorian did her speech. The speech was not that great, actually it was really bad, but oh well. After we sang we left to go to Fudruckers. I didn't have lunch there I don't really like that place. But I kept myself occupied there. The tableclothes on the tables were checkered, so me and Mary-Beth played checkers. We used the pepper and salt shakers along with other people's drinks for game pieces. It was a good game, but I lost. Oh well there's always next time. After we got back to the school me and Devin went to Jake in the Box to eat. Then I took him home.When I got back home I went to sleep for a little bit. It was a very good nap. Later on I went to my dad's house and we rented Lord of the Rings Return of the King. But he fell asleep after watching 5 minutes of it, so I left. Well I think I'm going to go watch the middle of it now. So, later."

"event","Well yesterday was kinda boring until later on that night. I went and hung out with Danielle at the mall. We tried to get a hold of Abbie when we were there to see if she wanted to come but she is really sick. Which isn't good at all. She said it hurt to talk, but hopefully she will be better by Wednesday because we are suppose to sing. Well after we found out she couldn't come we just walked around the mall. We ran into Kevin and Trenton and we talked to them for a little bit, but then we left them and then we seen Kelli and Micheal and we hung out with them. We were going to see a movie, but we decided against it due to the fact I had only 9 dollars and I needed to get gas. At one point this one guy called me over and asked me my name and number. I gave him my name and a number only  I don't know whose number it was I gave I just know it wasn't mine. I don't give my number out to guys who all I know about them is their first name. And I can't even recall what his name is. But he said he was going to call me to see if maybe I would want to go to a party. Already there is a personality clash. So that about all that hapened yesterday. This morning I finally got to go to church now that I have a car. It was fine. Trenton was asking why I never go to youth and was tryiong to get me to go tonight to cell groups, I probably won't. Also Sunshine talked to me about fine arts. She asked if I wanted to do a vocal solo. I'm not sure if I am or not. I'm still debating. Last year was a nightmare. But if I don't do it I'm going to have to hear it from everyone and there mom. Apparently people believe I have a great voice and think I don't do enough with it. What can I say, some people are just weird."

"event","Well we tried out yesterday and did ok for singing valentines. Only I guess our harmony for the chorus wasn't the best. So Mrs. Yunker is gonna have us try out again on Wednesday. The other people who did the same song are going to pick another song from what I hear. Hopefully that's the case. Anyway nothing else is really going on at the moment. I finally got to watch American Idol last night. Houston ""singer's"" are perhaps the most awful sounding people in the US. And boy do they have attitude! Me and some of my friends are going to try out next time if they have another season. I could pobably get to hollywood, but that's about it. But if it means that other people's ears will be saved from hearing people that sound as if they are mocking some sort of wild animal, I'm in! Well peace out."

"event","Wow....I guess I'll get everyone up to date on everything since the last time I actually put something on here. Well the most exiting thing in my life at the moment is the accident I was in last Friday. So I guess I wil start with that. On the glorious Friday I decided to go to my dad's house to chill with Nicole and her buddies Robert and Jeremy. I left at around 12:45 am to go home. I was going to just stay there and now I really wish I would have. That would've made my life soooo much easier now. Well anyway, when I was going down morton rd. there were these idiots who decided it would be smart to have their brights on so I wouldn't be able to see the F150 who decided to be just as smart and park directly in my lane, facing me, without having any form of lights on what-so-ever. So needless to say I hit the truck head-on. The guy in the F150 apologized for not having his lights on and said he had no idea why he didn't. Then he went on about how he was in an accident the previous year and couldn't afford this accident because his insurance was already extremely high. Now this guy seemed ok, but man it made me angry when he was like I'm sorry if my dad makes this go to court. I was thinking why would you take this to court when you can't win due to the fact you were in the WRONG LANE, PARKED, WITH NO LIGHTS ON! Then his dad came and he was just a jerk. Thank God I called Nicole so she, Robert, and Jeremy heard all he had to say and seen how he acted. Well anyways I guess since I'm only 17 he thought he could try to make the accident my fault. He asked me ""What's the first thing you arn in drivers education."" He said that in a kinda baby-talk way which really irritated me. Nicole said to have your lights on at night when you are out. Jeremy said to be on the right side of the rode. Then he said when bright lights were coming at you you are supposed to slow down and go to the side. Which was EXACTLY what I did. I told him that's what I did and Nicole was like there is no ways she was going the speed limit or faster because she wouldn't be standing here if she was. Which is most likely true due to the fact at going probably somewhere between 20-30 mph my car is totalled. If I was going 45 I would have gotten hurt. Well after we got to listen to the clown the cops finally got there about an hour after we called to report it. But of course this cop wasn't the one who was taking the report, but he did get statements from me and the clowns son. He was pretty cool the cop I mean. Then another cop came from Waller county, the favorite of the McKinley clan!!!!! Not! this was the same one who threatened to put me in jail after a little incident with my dad. Me and Nicole were like great. But he left as soon as he came thank God. I was already dealing with enough morons, I really didn't feel like dealing with another one. Then finally a State Trooper came who was really cool. He took the report and we finally we got to go dare I say it? Home. I was glad he took the report and he was really cool. He joked around with us. I don't think he liked the other people too much though. But that was a great night. Well now that that happened I have to go through all the other stuff. The person who I was got in the wreck with is now stating he was off to the side of the road. Which I think is funny considering if he was on the side of the road he would have had to have been in the ditch. I swear that guy really isn't the brightest crayon in the box! 

Well, aside from that I am getting ready for singing valentine auditions. This is where you go to classes throughout the day and sing to someone in front of the class! It's sooooo much fun. I did it my freshman year and had a blast only this year I won't have to wear shoes that will give me blisters all day. Me and a couple of my other friends decided to do Ain't No Mountain High Enough. It's going to be sooo much fun. Hopefully we make it. Wish us luck."

"event","Well today started as a usual Sunday. I went to church in the morning, got home around 1:00. Then I went to sleep for a while. I got up at about 6. Later on Krystal called me up to invite me to go see a movie with some of her friends, Kyle, Victor, Donald, and Trevor. We were all goin to go to eat first but if we would've done that we would have been late to go see the movie. We went to go see Bad Santa it was pretty funny. If I could have changed anything about the movie it would be I wouldn't have sat next to Donald. At one point during the movie he decided to hold my hand, nothing more than that. I tried to pull my hand away, but he wouldn't let go! So yeah no, that will NEVER happen again. I really do not like the guy like that. He's nice and all but no. First off I think he is like 21??? Or something like that. Then he just no. But after the movie was over me Krystal and Kyle went to Wendy's, then we drove around a little bit. It was fun."

"event","Well this is my first entry on this thing. I got an account last week but I never have time to write anything. Christmas vacation started Sat. thank God. I though it was never going to happen. I passed all my classes with C's and above which I'm not too happy about it, but come next semester I'll do better. 

Today I went shopping in the morning with my dad and Nicole. That well.... it went. I didn't really feel too great when we went. Of course, I have to get sick once the break starts. I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping I only have 2 more presents to get. I'm supposed to go later on tonight with Krystal. Well that's about it for now."

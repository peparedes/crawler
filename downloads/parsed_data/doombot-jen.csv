"event","Another piece of Las Vegas history is about to be destroyed. So we decided to check out the Sahara Casino and Hotel one last time.

We ate at House of Lords. Great place! Unfortunately they were out of most food since they were closing in four days. Still the steaks available were awesome and the staff was very professional. At that point what can they do to you? Fire you? Still they were very nice but you can feel the sadness in the place.

As we left with full bellies, we played a few games of slots. I don't really gamble. What I do is spend about 10 dollars every 2 months on the dollar machines. Once they money's gone, I walk away. I don't try to win back my money. I don't find the lucky streak I'm sure is coming. I don't apply illogical assumptions. ""I haven't won in a while... that means I'll win tonight."" I've written enough gambling articles to know how much the odds are against you.

Well tonight... tonight we won $304 dollars. I went from happy to Whipdee doo as the machine kept clinging. Free dinner and extra cash! We walked around the casino but at this point there just isn't much to see. The buffet is gone, the arcade is empty, and sections of the casino are closed off.

So we turned around and said goodbye to the Sahara. We may come back on Sunday to try to X pound burrito.

So while saying goodbye is sad, we did it with a great meal and a winning night at the casino. You can't beat that.

Now to find something fun for us to spend the money on."

"event","Started off Christmas 2010 sick with some sort of flu or super cold. It's been over 10 days and I'm just starting to feel the effects starting to leave.

During all this, we've had our holiday festivities (and glad to have them by the way). This year was the first time we were able to have what we both considered a ""real"" Holiday party. While we've had parties in the past, there's just something more special when it's in a home you both own instead of a tiny apartment.

Overall December was fairly busy. In no particular order.

Kristen and Robert's wedding. We drove to San Diego to see two friends get marries. The smiles on both of their faces was something great to see. Those two love each other and it makes me smile just to think about it. =)

Guy introduced me to Ren and Stimpy. I'd never seen it before. Unfortunately it was one of the revival series and not as good as the one's he knew and loved. We then watched one of the real ones and it was far better. No deers eating _______________.

Got a day off on Friday and a Christmas bonus. Both welcomed. It's been a while since I've gotten a bonus. Although I do have one client that pays more than I ask sometimes. =)

Saw our friend Brooke in San Diego. It's been too long since we've seen her. We all had dinner at the Creole Restaurant where Guy used to work. I'm glad the restaurant is still in business. When we left I offered to make them a website and just get (some) publicity as they were complaining about the lack of customers. They just didn't seem to want to advertise. Thankfully they were still there and doing very well. Yelp gives them a lot of business which is great because they just seem so anti advertisement. But they're around and doing well so that's great. =)

Saw Tron Legacy. A great continuation of the story. Went to Steak and Shake. Guy loves it. To me it's ""merely good"". It's probably a reversal of the IN-N-OUT situation. I love IN-N-OUT. Guy can't see why people go crazy for it.

Had Christmas. Got a nice loose open sweater. Thus proving Guy listens because I don't like a lot of clothes. Clothing just bothers me. The fabric scratches and I twitch. Hence a loose tank top and a wrap around is my daily wear. Got a cast iron skillet that I've been wanting. Some Dino Poop, a nice purse from Judith, cookbooks so I don't get bored with what I cook, and some other things I can't seem to remember right now.

Got Guy a Kinect. I took the step of putting the box within a box so he couldn't guess the gift based on dimensions. He's loving it. =)

I guess that's it. A very nice December and Christmas with weddings, seeing old friends, people doing well in their business, a surprised fiance, house parties, bonuses, and a lack of drama from bad people. =)

Here's to more Christmas times together Love! =)"

Had some friends (new friends to me) come over and watched Guy dazzle use with his Michael Jackson moved from Michael Jackson the experience.

Put up our tree in our first home. Guy got a nice ornament that said Our First Home that looks like a bird house. Which is awesome because I love birds. I think I'm turning into my Mexican aunts in relation to birds.

Then saw Bill Cosby. That man can talk about anything and still make it funny. =)

Finishing my Nanowrimo novel. I'm about 400 works ahead of schedule. It's fun but I'm looking forward to it being over. =)"

"event","One of the things I've been looking forward to is coming full circle with Halloween. As a child I used to love the holiday. Candy was awesome but just dressing up was great. Then as I got older I celebrated it less and I figured it was now my turn to hand out the candy and have a cool decorated house.

So I (we in a way) handed out candy. Guy's working at the Bonnie Screams attraction (hearing great things about it) so he wasn't able to hand out candy with me. 

Nice to see the kids are still jazzed about Halloween. 90% of the kids said Thank You while the others were too shy or scared. We have bowl with a skeleton hand that slams town and scares the kids.

Learned a few tricks. Don't have a full bowl of candy as kids tend to grab more. Having a 1/4 full bowl results in most 1 piece kids.

Having a sensor more down the walkway would be better so I know for sure kids on coming up.

The Pacman ghost was a big hit. Glad to see kids know what Pacman is so I don't feel too old.

Just nice to see really respectful kids having fun and now being on the other end of the candy process.

ps. Yes, We're the nice house that gives out A list Candy and not Pennies, Chick Tracts, or packages of Carrots."

As a temp fix, I installed the operating system on the second hard drive so I can get online. I also have a CPU fan error where the fan just seems to work 1/2 the time. I'm monitoring the temp and it stays around 35 - 40 C. I have it set to shut down if it goes over 55 C.

So recommendations for a harddrive with at least 500 Gigs and ideal for program and operating system installation. eg. Great access speed.

I had left my ex by about a year or so when we met but that year was still pretty miserable. Not because the idiot wasn't around but the people around were just so miserable to be around. One roommate was emotionally dead while the other was angry at the world. 

But then I met someone wonderful and together things got better. From sharing a burrito to eating at a high end sushi/Japanese restaurant. From taking the bus to having my own car. From horrible small living arrangements to having our own house. From no pets to two Cairns. From no vacations to multiple trips including an awesome time at Disneyworld. And then all the little things I just can't think about right now.

There's been bad times of course. Deaths, accidents but those things were either going to happen anyway or unforeseen and they would have been harder to deal with solo.

So thanks for all you do Love. I Love you a bunch!"

Learned a few things already:
 
Apply epoxy on both the wall AND the matting. Did this halfway though so it's not a total loss.
A drill is invaluable.
Finishing/Brad (or whatever) nails aren't good at holding trim against matting. I need thin screws with at least 2 inch length.
Drilling trimming first and then using a finishing/brad nail helps prevent bent nails.
Razor Knives are awesome.

I woke up and saw a plethora of cars and police around the Chihuahua ladies house. (She's the one who presumably owned the Chihuahua that came into our yard but didn't care when I found it.)

So far it's about 7ish unmarked vehicles (or at least subtle about the markings), a S.W.A.T. wagon, a S.W.A.T Battle Wagon, a K-9 Unit, cops with clothing that looks to protect against explosions, cops with what looked to be gas grenade launchers, and just loads of cops.

So far they've taken 5 people out of the house and it took them 30 minutes to do so.

This part is just pure speculation but I wonder if the large numbers of cops, reluctance to storm the house, and blast proof clothing indicates a meth lab.

<p>Life appears to be going well.
</p>
<p> 
  I'm continuing to work at my at home job. There's no bosses with unrealistic expectations. I'm not made to feel I should know how to work with SQL databases or other things I never claimed to know how to do. Nor am I asked to work extra hours when I've already said I don't feel well enough to work. Nor am I being ignored when I ask to reduce my hours and find someone else.
</p>
<p>
  So working at home is great. If I hurt, I lay on the floor for a while and continue in a bit. The duties are well within my abilities and if I'm asked to do something extra it's not unreasonable.
</p>
<p>  
  Finished my car shopping. I was going to get a Jeep but I only had so much money in savings. I could get a Jeep with a questionable history for the money I had or get something else that was more dependable. So after researching (especially cars for tall people), I went with the VW New Beetle. Amazingly, it's very roomy inside. I get about 3 extra inches of space and sometimes those extra inches really make the difference. <img src=""http://img838.imageshack.us/i/40280125982811496318074.jpg/"" align=""right"" />I almost went with a Orange 2002 VW Beetle from Car Max. Amazingly I was approved for a loan but after my final payment it would have been double the price of the other car.  </p>
<p> 
  <img src=""http://yfrog.com/e438936125983063502618074j"" />The green car is from a private seller and about 1/2 the price of the other one. I'm saving about 1000 dollars in taxes alone. There's that risk of getting a lemon but I ran a CarFax report, drove it around, checked it out, and both Guy and I got a good feeling. And if something is wrong the difference can be applied to what ever is broken (if anything). Also this one has more options that I would have had to buy with the other one. The orange one had this strange device that plays music cassettes... the green one plays from the iPod. </p>
<p>
Danny from Texas came by to stay with us during the weekend of the Classic Gaming Expo. That was fun and I'm still in awe of the Tiki Room Gift I got for my birthday. It's going to look awesome when the rooms completed but the gift looks awesome now. It's a art piece that spells out Tiki Room.</p>
<p>
Well I guess that's it. Guy and Ryan and a unnamed friend are shooting a movie about a time traveler looking for fried chicken.

Got my birth certificate mailed by Mom so I got my Driver's license all taken care off. Never got around to it since I was dealing with back and therapy issues.

Searching for a car. It's either the Toyota Yaris or the VW New Beetle. I'm leaning toward the Bug since seeing the Guy's eyes light up when I wend the Autobot symbol on it would be so worth it.<img src=""http://home.comcast.net/~mathewignash/images/csbumblebee2.jpg""/>

About two weeks back we went to Disneyland. One of our friends Gina and Alex were nice enough to let us stay at their awesome home in LA. Awesome because it's cute. You can tell it's from a time when the homes had some style. The drive over there was typical. Delays with the traffic. This is the reason I can't live in LA anymore. It took forever to do anything.

Anyway, I still had my California ID so we were able to save using their Local Residents special. First stop at Disneyland? Captain EO. Yes, Captain EO was back in it's Pre White Michael Jackson splendor. 

It was almost a gentle ribbing of sorts with Guy and I. I saw Captain EO when it first ran but he never did. When ask to describe it... ""Oh Love... how can I? There are no words to convey the splendor. It's like looking at the face of God and trying to describe it."" I guess I was right since we saw it 4 or 5 times over the weekend.

For some reason, even though the anniversary of the TIKI, TIKI, TIKI, TIKI, TIKI room was two years ago, they still had new Merchandise. I spent more than I wanted to but that stuff ends up on ebay at 3 times the price so I got some Tiki Babies, A Tiki Statue, A Tiki Letterbox, Tiki ornaments and such. Another friend of ours, Kristen, was nice enough to use her discount. Thanks! =)

We continued to have a nice time with Kristen and Gina and their fiances (not the same person), and walked around California Adventure. Looks like they're going to install some things that didn't have before... fun rides. At least most fun rides. I wonder if that means the tortilla making exhibit will be gone.

Spent some time at the California Hotel (and the fireplace) where Guy and I had our first date. Rested for a bit and started the long drive back. Guy was tired so I drove for a bit. I scared him accidentally. My legs are longer so after a hour of driving, I decided to just click the seat back. At that moment on the other side (in the opposite direction) a Semi or something came and filled the car with Midnight light. Guy hears a thump from the seat, a shift in speed (when the seat went back) and a bright light wakes him out of a deep sleep.

Poor thing.

But all in all, a good trip. Saw some old friends, met some new ones, got to see Captain EO, and I have new items for my office when I convert it into a TIKI style room.

Now off to watch Dr. Who."

The good this is most people there know what to do. We even had a Tsunami test every month. A EXTREMELY loud horn would wail for one minute every month. I always got scared for a few seconds at the beginning and then got used to it. We even had a Tsunami kit with food and fresh water that we never had to use.

Then there's another thing to consider. I hope they'll be ok with supplies after. I don't know if it's better now but any ""hickup"" would cause shortages. A strike on the mainland would result in empty shelves for a few weeks. Toilet paper was always the first to go, hence I stocked up on it. even had reserves in the closet!

Nearly everything has to be boated/flown in. Here if a store is out you can just go to another one. That's true in some ways in Kauai but many times if one store was out, they were all out. Since people went down the list. But there's only so many choices there.

Just hope everything's ok there (and anywhere else that might be hit)."

"event","Basically providing marketing and some tech support for Wordpress blogs and installation for certain plugins. It's for a position that's 3 hours out of my time zone.

I send them a e-mail that basically said: ""Well... I'm three hours outside of your timezome, I don't know if that'll work for you since that'll be 6:00 AM my time. Maybe we can discuss other job opportunities if you're still interested.""

It would be nice to just work from home. I could have the American dream of going to work dress like a slob all day in a tanktop and a Hawaiian wrap around.

Dare I dream?

So I have three stumbling blocks.

They want someone at 9:00 New York time. I don't want to get up before 6:00 AM.
They want someone right away. I have to give two-weeks notice to my current job (although I could probably still do freelance). I have my Plasma Disc (not Disco) Decompression. So I wouldn't be able to start until the following Monday. I wonder how to phrase that.

""Well I can't start on that day... I'm having surgery. How about five days later?""

Oh well... go ahead and try. If they want me, I'm sure something can be worked out.

More money would be nice..."

"event","The house is continuing to be awesome. We didn't get to do the things we wanted such as re-sod the lawn, add the Roman bathtub as a present to Guy, or get a few other additions done but they'll get done soon enough. Those things are just extras and the house and the lack of the realtor/lender team are enough.

I'm reading more thanks to the Kindle. I don't know what makes me read more but I do! Just finished Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone, reading the rest of Skeleton Crew, starting on Book 3 of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, and then I may give the Discworld series a try or move on to the send in the Dexter series.

Had what might have been my final doctor's appointment. I'm still in the quasi-grey area with my pain. I'm just hovering outside (I presume) of where they'd be willing to close out the case. Since the procedure for my back worked well, they're going to do another one for my neck. Basically a needle into my neck and they'll eradicate some of the tissue that's swelled.

I guess that's it... just continue to open boxes and put away items. Guy and I took a bit of a break. I guess we were running on reserves and just needed a rest.

It's been about 7 days of less craziness at the new house. One week since we had to get up early in the morning and stay up into the wee hours of the night making sure that EVERYTHING was out of the house. We still need to put things away, there's no doggie door yet, there's a few MINOR things that need to be done but it's just awesome over here.

Nobody is stomping overhead and keeping us awake and the dog agitated.
We don't have to go over 10 - 12 speed bumps to get into our place.
There's storage EVERYWHERE. Room in the kitchen, multiple closets, space in the garage, an attic, and outdoor shed, cabinets, overhead shelves, etc.
It's faster to get to work. 10 minutes vs 20 minutes at the old place.
There's no chicken bones and dog poop everywhere.
I don't have to hear cell phone conversations near our door.
There's nobody to accuse us of stealing rocks.
The dogs are more relaxed. They stay out longer and don't do their business indoors anymore. They don't even go crazy when we leave!
We both even feel better. Guy looks healthier and he's got his appetite back. My skin isn't as oily and patchy. Jeez... if you live in Vegas, make sure to find out our Realtor so you know who NOT to get.

So yeah, Guy's awesome for getting the house. =)

Back to reading Book 3 of the Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries and re-reading Harry Potter."

"event","Well I've had the Kindle DX for a while. Here's my random collection of thoughts.

It's heavier than the Kindle 2 but it doesn't bother me. I have a bad hand and reduced strength but I'm still able to hold it somewhat easily in my hand. Holding it's a moot point since it usually just rests on my leg or on my stomach. Guy has the smaller one but I'd rather have the bigger version.

PDF viewing is usually fine. This depends on how the PDF was rendered. There's no real zoom on the PDF viewer on the Kindle so you're somewhat stuck at the default size. You can rotate it and cut the page in half. This increases the text and image size but that's about it. If someone decided to put two pages on a single PDF page, you're stuck reading very small print.

I don't use the text to speech option. It's like having a book read to me by Steven Hawking. It's jarring to imagine Sookie Stackhouse (a young blond waitress from the South) speaking like this: 

""I...wa...ted...for...my...fiiiiiirssst....vam....pi...re....to....shooow....up.""

I haven't used the mp3 playback yet.

Battery charging is pretty decent. I charge it about every four days even though I could charge it less if I wanted.

The clip on light works fine. The only issue is you can't have the light directly over the Kindle. You'll get a bright area that washes out the text. As long as you put it at an angle you're fine. The light adds to the weight but not that much. Sometimes I just clip the light to the lamp and use it that way. The light is somewhat concentrated so I can read while Guy's in bed next to me.

The web browser is VERY BASIC but it's better than no browser at all. Most of the side links you tend to ignore show up first on the kindle so you have to scroll though links before you get to the meat of a page. For example, TVtropes.org has about 4 pages of links (The Kindle renders those first and then the ""real content""). I usually just click Next Page 3 times and I'm there. If you're viewing text centric sites you'll be fine. Anything more pretty becomes semi frustrating. It's not like you're seeing a small version of your favorite website but rather a row of content. Image a three column table. Instead of seeing them side by side sometimes it'll render like a long list.

The internet connection is free so I can access my favorite sites. It's somewhat slow (or it's taking time to render). Either way it's not as fast as surfing on my desktop.

Ordering books is easy. I ordered Skeleton Crew from Stephen King and I was able to read it by the time I walked to the back bedroom.

<i>""There's just something about holding a old book in your hand""</i>. There probably is but I seem to be reading MORE with the Kindle. Despite it being heavier, I find the Kindle is easier on my arm muscles since I can just put it on my abdomen. I don't seem to miss the old paper books too much.

So if you like reading... get a Kindle DX. =)"

"event","Just when we're trying to deal with the stress of closing on the house... Junie gets her eye bitten by Sophie.

Junie started it (as far as I could tell) but Sophie finished it. When those two dogs fight it's nearly impossible to get them away from each other quickly. We have to pick one up and hold it up and away from our face.

This time, there was an eye injury. Junie has a fighter's cut (just like in the movies) over her right eye. We put her in her old cone that we kept around, cut the hair around the eye (to prevent dirt and dust), cleaned it with antibiotics and took her to the vet. The vet said we were lucky. Any lower and she would have lost her eye.

Sigh..."

So far it's been a nice one. I got a Kindle DX, some assorted candies, a tiny Nintendog that looks like Sophie, Scribblenauts, and a full stomach from the Qualducant we had. That's Quail, Duck, and Pheasant. Oh and a house (assuming nothing bad happens).

I got Guy a Kindle 2, assorted Kindle accessories, and a Vampire hunter kit.

We're watching the Dr. Who Christmas special right now.

"event","Thanksgiving was awesome. We were hoping to enjoy it at our new house which APPEARS to be a certainty but hey with our realtor, who knows. I'm the cynical one and Guy's more optimistic but it'll probably happen.

Guy made a Turducken and Mac and Cheese with Cajun Sausage. Again. Awesome.

We saw Bill Cosby yesterday. That man is so comfortable in his role. Just strolled out in loose pants, maybe gym pants and a top the said: ""Hello Friend"" and chatted for two hours. Definitely something you should go see if you ever get the chance.

Taking the dogs over to the new house tomorrow so they'll get used to it, have a bit of a run, and hopefully that'll minimize the stress on them when they move. I think they'll be so happy to have a yard that it won't be an issue.

Almost finished with National Novel Writing Month. Just 4,700 more words to go.

Happy Love? =P I posted."

"event","I'll probably be making low key updates since Guy's on vacation and it's a good way to keep us updated on all the little things.

So taking the dogs out isn't a really interesting thing that I should blog about but I'll do it for this week or so.

Speaking of the dogs, they tore out the green oasis area the dogs use for pooing at the complex. This is a great idea. I can't tell you how sick and tired I am of lush green grass in the desert. They replaced it with sand and rock. This is another great idea. If there's one thing I really miss from living in the desert is access to rock and gravel.

As a plus, they added plants with thorns. They plants fan out to a dog's eye level thus increasing the changes of poking a dog in the eye. Since this used to be the dog's pooping area (and for other dogs as well) they want to go into the thorn area. However after Junie's eye got poked with a bush, I try to stay away.

The people here are pretty mad. We're known for being dog owners (Since Junie throws herself at the window) so we had a few people already knock on the door and ask: ""Can you believe this?"" One guy even told us he's going to just let his dogs **** over the entire complex.

And speaking of the complex... my word it's ghetto now. This used to be a nice place (burned out lights, and a pass the buck mentality are the exception). Trash and litter started showing up around the area, and a sense of no upkeep crept into the place. People started leaving and rents were lowered to bring in more people. Trash isn't equal to the money you make. I remember plenty of people growing up in Arkansas and Missouri that were dirt poor but still took pride in how they acted and what they had. Yet, the thugged out and drugged out groups started showing up after the rents went down. They cut back on security so that doesn't help. So at any rate, I hope we get to leave soon. Too many bad memories here.

Still no update on the last house we offered to buy. It's a house that I didn't get to look at from the inside but I trust Guy enough to know if I would like it. I looked for more houses but I didn't see anything spectacular and for us. The spectacular ones tend to be HOA and I don't want to get a fine for parking in our driveway or for having the wrong color door.

Guess that's it!"

"event","Junie (The thin one) tends to be the more happy go lucky yet sometimes reverts into a Chihuahua like nervous dog. She'll play and then bark with such nervousness and whineyness that you'd think she had Chihuahua in her history.

"event","I got my Plasma Spinal Decompression performed at 7:00 in the morning after going to sleep at 3:30. So I woke up at 5:45. Fortunately, I slept after I got back.

In a nutshell, I was injected with a needle and had some of the material in my spine blasted away with radio waves. The pressure in my spine goes down and the leakage from the pressure stops as well. In case anyone was wondering, I really wasn't in a nutshell when this happened.

I'm sore from the procedure but my back feels different. Like there's more mobility. Before I felt like I walked like a 1970's action figure. Now I just seem a bit more loose but sore.

So here's to hoping that everything is fine. This procedure is sort of a last chance option for me. Anything more is just too invasive and my pain is just hovering out of the ""We think you should live with it"" range. I have a 4.5 level or so and they want to get me down to a 3. I may get a similar procedure done on my neck. It all depends on what the doctor thinks and if fixing the back will fix the pain in the neck.

Guy's leaving on his vacation soon (a vacation that I insisted he take). Figured I should say something since I'm segueing from me in the hospital to him leaving. It's just the best time for him to go that still manages to fit well with my medical issues / work / doctor's appointments and such. I'm more than capable of doing stuff I need to do at home on my own so there's no reason for him not to go. I gave him the thumbs up again today and after taking care of me for over a year while sick (not to say he hasn't before), he deserves this.

The worst part will be dealing with two Cairn Terriers. Junie likes to woof and bark at everything and Sophie likes to pee. This should be <i>fun</i>. Sophie really does nothing wrong. If she has to pee, the options are few. She won't pee out on the patio with the gravel since it smells like Junie. She has to go outside. Junie is just nervous and therefore loud when people are nearby. We not have people living upstairs so there's noise as they Frankenstein Walk up and down the rooms.

"event","Looks like we're not getting yet another house. Seriously, how hard should it be? We got the loan, we got two separate letters from banks saying that we're good.

Yet we will miss a house by one hour, the bank pulls out at the last minute (thinking that they can get a higher offer), or we just underbid when compared to the other offers(even though we add to the asking price). We added $10,000 to the last one and we were still underbidded! We added $8,000 to another one and still lost that one.

Well... we have one more possible house. So far we're the only people bidding on it so here's hoping.

In other news, my back operation/injection (Plasma Discharge for the technical) is this Wednesday. Turns out my back is a little worse than initially thought. Instead of two vertebra out on the top and on the bottom it's more like two vertebra and one more that's slightly out. Same situation on the bottom vertebra as well.

So here's to hoping the pain will go away. I had to take today off just because it's hurting so bad.

Finished reading Thinner by Steven King.

"event","So far it's been a hot week. The temperature's been about 108 with peaks in the teens. It's times like this that I miss the nice temperature in Kauai. Still there's more things to do here. =)

The house issue is still chugging along with the speed of the world's fastest snail. Supposedly, all we're waiting for is the underwriter and for the bank to fix the heater and plumbing. This is an assumption because the appraisal could have other items that are related to health and safety. Honestly, I'm not expecting this to be done soon. The papers have to be signed, I still expect to see some fighting with the bank over who fixes what, get the people to come over to fix it, have another inspection, wait for more paperwork, fight again with the realtor over items in the paperwork, and then finally we'll get the keys. I hope.

A friend of mine has a kid with a possible brain tumor. While serious, the chances of it being malignant are small and the doctor is supposed to be excellent. So here's to hoping everything will be fine.

We've been watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. There's a show that'll turn on the waterworks. Today's episode was about a family who lost everything in a fire, then had to go live in a tent, then they ""moved up"" to a trailer, then the father went for a swim with his daughter and died, the oldest son died trying to save them both, then the daughter thought she killed her daddy by causing him to drown. Seeing little kids cry is hard. However it's a good show and it's nice to see reality tv that doesn't reward bad behavior.

I have an appointment this week for an evaluation for another back procedure. It's just to discuss the feasibility of a more invasive procedure. Basically it's more than a spinal injection but less than a surgery... sorta. They wouldn't cut me open as oppose to injecting a needle and removing biomass. 

I guess that's it. Going to work on a audio edit and watch True Blood later tonight."

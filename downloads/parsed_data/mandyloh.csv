Sorry I haven't been updating this blog, but that's just coz I wasn't travelling anymore and there wasn't much to talk about, besides the fact that I was sleeping in and being a total bum!!!

But NOW! I'm in Hong Kong! And best of all, I'll be home TOMORROW!!!

Gosh, its such a strange feeling, coming home after almost 9 months away! I really really miss home, but it feels strange too, kinda like a bittersweet emotion. I think its a feeling everyone gets at the end of a trip, a sadness that its over. So I'm really happy to be coming home, but I'm also rather sad that my adventures have come to an end...

But enough about musing and introspection, lemme rave about HONG KONG!

I used to hate HK with a vengeance, because the last time I was here, I was 12, and it was the middle of summer, and I had just come from San Francisco, where it was cold! So it was hot, humid and dirty! And everyone was rude! Plus, I wasn't interested in shopping then, so I was just a grumpy girl feeling hot and frustrated.

But NOW! Wow!!! Its such a vibrant place, and now that its cleaned up (after SARS) its really very happening! I'm not even talking about the clubs, which I haven't been to, but just the whole atmosphere and the buildings and the shops!

My goodness, you could spend months here and not get bored! There are like, TONS of different shops selling extremely cool stuff! And the streets are so bright and colourful with all the neon signboards, kinda like NY Times Square, only much more crowded!

Ok ok, enough gushing for now. On to important stuff (IF anyone even reads this before tomorrow!) I'll be arriving in Changi Airport at 7.45pm, 4 Feb, Fri, Terminal 2. Whoever wants to join the welcome party please feel free! ;)"

"event","Yes, I finally tried snowboarding for the first time, and MAN! It is SOOOOO AMAZINGLY FUN!!!! :D

Everybody's gotta try this sport! Its absolutely fantastic! I was whizzing down the bunny slopes and it felt sooo good! 

Yes yes, bunny slopes...but I'm only a beginner! And I managed to maneouvre myself down the slopes pretty well, I think! Could zip left and right, and EVEN avoid some obstacles! (ie other fallen snowboarders/ skiiers)

I took a 2hr beginner lesson, and it was really worth it! (although it was very expensive!) Because before the lesson, I was trying to snowboard but couldn't get anywhere, and after the lesson, I was really zipping around! Its sooo cool!!!!

I LOVE IT!!!! WOOOHOOOO!!!! WHEEEEEEEE!!!!!! :)"

"event","I'm in Vancouver, Canada!

Yep, after 3 months of hectic travelling, I've finally come to a point of total rest and relaxation! Ahhh...feels good!

I planned Vancouver to be my last stop, because I really wanted to experience life here for a longer period of time. So I'm planning to stay 1-2 months here with my aunt and uncle. 

Its been wonderful ever since I reached here. This morning, I saw snow falling from my bedroom window! Unfortunately, the ground temperature's still too high, so it melted instantly on the ground. Oh well, it was still very pretty!

My uncle also drove me up to Mount Seymour (very near where we stay) to see the view. It was absolutely spectacular! And this isn't even a very high mountain! I can't imagine what the view must be like from the Rockies!

Well, I think I'm really tempted to migrate here now! :P Yep, I can't think of a reason why not!

By the way, here's a link to lots of photos. I didn't have time/ resources to put them online previously. Sorry for the delay, folks! Enjoy!!!

Actually, I've only got a day here, but I went for this ""Seattle Underground"" tour which was EXCELLENT and helped give me a good overview of the history of Seattle. Did you know that Seattle was totally razed in a great fire in 1889, and then they totally rebuilt the city ABOVE the original one? The underground tour brought us to the city underneath, and that was really neat!

Also went to the Space Needle, that very famous landmark of Seattle. Refused to pay US$12 to go up though! So just admired it from ground level. :P hehehe, ok, I'm cheapo! I know!

Tomorrow I'll be going up to Canada, and that's ADIOS USA!!! It was fun while it lasted!"

"event","Just a quick update: After Sweden, we went back to Frankfurt to catch our departing flight out of Europe and end our Europe Adventure...sigh! So sad! Didn't ever want it to end!!!

While in Frankfurt, we stayed with Michelle, Ravi's girlfriend, a really really lovely girl! Very hospitable and friendly and fun to hang out with! We went clubbing twice for the 2 nights that we were there! Lotsa fun! :)

Oh, there were Christmas markets in Frankfurt too, so pretty and fun! Very festive, sure puts you in a Christmas mood! I love just walking around and looking at all the pretty ornaments and stuff, and if I had a million bucks I'm sure I could finish using all the money up in those markets! :P

So anyway, now I'm back in New York, and in a funny way, I feel like I know it already! Not overwhelmed or anything, and its really nice to just take my time and stroll around Central Park and all that coz I've already done all the touristy things the last time!

Staying in a hostel, which is really fun coz you get to make lotsa friends! So tonight I'm going with some new found friends to watch the Christmas tree Light-Up at Rockefeller! Its gonna be so cool!"

"event","ITS SNOWING!!!

Woke up this morning and saw the glorious sight of SNOWFALL!!!

We quickly sprang up and piled on our layers and layers of clothes, then ran outside to play with the snow! WOOHOO!!! First time I've experienced snowfall! SOOO COOL!!!

It was so awesome!!! I just ran out and started squealing and jumping around in the snow! It was so cool to just stand there and feel the snow fall on our faces and our hands, and I turned my face upwards to catch the soft snowflakes with my tongue. SOOO FUN!!! Felt like a little kid! Hehehee!!!

And the fresh snow is so nice and white and fluffy, perfect for scooping up and having a little snowball fight! Hehehe! I LOVE SNOW!!!

But the snow started to melt sometime in the afternoon because the temperature is actually not that cold yet, so now there's slush on the ground. A little yuckky...

Oh yeah, and tonight we had Swedish meatballs for dinner! Yummy!!! And last night we had salmon!! Mmmm...my tummy's happy!!! :P"

"event","Yep, I'm in vice-central!

This place is really interesting! Generally, Holland has an amazing philosophy, which I think is rather refreshing, coming from stifling S'pore...

Basically, you can do almost anything you want! And the best thing is, the crime rates here aren't alot higher than anywhere else in the world. Which just means one thing: Treat people as rational individuals and they'll know how to take care of themselves! No raving lunatics run around here, and except for the Theo van Gogh incident, I think its a very safe country! 

I love how they explain the drugs situation: Drugs are illegal, but are tolerated for personal use. How cool is that???

And the government is so liberal, although ecstasy is illegal, they set up little booths to test the quality of the ecstasy pills people have, so that they don't die because of bad quality drugs. Amazing!

The red light district is also really cool! Its instant gratification for these guys. The girls stand at the glass doors strutting their stuff, and if you're interested, just pop in for a quickie! Kinda like those microwavable meals...quick and easy!

Oh yeah, one other interesting thing to mention: it got so cold today there was HAIL!!! My goodness, that's an experience! I've never even experienced snow yet, and I get hit by hail! Rather painful, I must say! It was very fun though, seeing these little pellets of ice raining down on everyone. Reminded me of Solero shots.

Hey, I keep thinking of food...I must be hungry! :P"

Its not just the old buildings and the sculptures and the gardens, its the whole AIR about it! You just have to walk along the street and look at the gorgeous sunset and your heart will melt at the stunning beauty of it all...

Its getting really cold though! Walking around after sunset (which in winter now, is just about 5pm!) is quite challenging, so we go home quite early nowadays. Which makes our days really REALLY short because I wake up so late all the time! :P

Still love travelling though!"

"event","Damn shiok!

Arrived in Paris early on Monday morning, and checked into our posh Park Hyatt hotel room right in the heart of Paris! It was walking distance from the Opera House and Place Vendome, along the Rue de la Paix. Awesome!

Whoa, the luxury of this one night in a 5 star hotel is indescribable! After more than a month of roughing it out in lousy hostels and other assorted accomodations, we finally had this AWESOME deluxe room with artful finishings and a limestone bathroom that opens directly into the room. GLORIOUS!! 

I mean, you really won't be able to understand just how happy I was in that room! We refused to do any sightseeing whatsoever! Just relaxed and lazed the whole day on the ultra comfy queen size bed. Ahh...

And, because I'm a diamond member of Hyatt (Hyuk hyuk), they allowed a late check-out at 4pm!!! Woohoohoo!!
So we had like 2 full days of pure bliss! (can you tell I'm almost delirious with joy?)

Oh well, now we're back to being backpackers...sigh. But it was really fun while it lasted!"

The weather here is a really nice change from the blistering cold of Austria and Switzerland, and we could actually get a suntan again! :) It also made Tim and I alot more cheerful and energetic. So its true! Sunshine is good for you! I'll appreciate Singapore's sun more when I go back home!

Nice is also relatively less expensive, and we managed to find a 2-star hotel with an attached kitchenette in the room! So we've been cooking all our meals, and here's the shocker! I actually ENJOY cooking!!! :P

(Mom, are you happy?)

Anyway, Nice is nice! (I really didn't mean to pun so much) But I think Switzerland still takes the cake as my favourite place for now. Let's see how it goes. (Tim loves Monaco though...yawn)"

We were on our way to the train station to catch our train to Vienna, when we were stopped by Inspection Officers at the Metro station to check our tickets. We showed them our tickets, and it turns out we bought the wrong ones. We REALLY thought they were valid for 2 hours, but they were only actually valid for 30 minutes. Argh...stupid signs that are not in English...

We tried explaining to them that it was an honest mistake, but they didn't care. So we were fined 400 Kr per person. AAAAAARRRRGGGHHH.....

To make matters worse, because we didn't have any more cash with us (in Czech currency), we had to draw the money out of the ATM. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE MISSED OUR TRAIN TO VIENNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So that was a bad day...sigh. And now we have a bad aftertaste to Prague. Shucks."

Yes, its true what they all say. This place is BEAUTIFUL!!!

Its just amazing how beautiful Europe is! I love it here! The language barrier is always a little difficult, and so is getting orientated with a new place. But its really awesome just seeing new places and stuff. And the things here are cheaper than the rest of Western Europe because its not in the EU yet. Phew!

So everyone, I'm totally enjoying myself, and taking care of myself as well, so don't worry! :)
I'm also travelling with Tim, which is great because its so much easier having a travel buddy to just rely on and talk to. I think it would have been very tough travelling alone in Europe because its alot harder with the different languages. I would probably have been able to travel alone in US but not here!

As for pictures...hmm, its going to be tough to upload them because now I've gotta use internet cafes. So its gonna be very expensive to do so. I'll try to figure out a way.

The weather here has been rather unpredictable. It was really cold in Berlin, but here in Prague we've been having rather warm days. I'm sure its going to get a lot colder as the days progress though!

Well, that's all for now. And as a parting note, things are just wonderful now!!! :)"

"event","Its the stuff movies are made of.

Met a stranger on the subway (well, how it happened was he came up to me and told me I was beautiful. Hehe...)

The thing about him was that he did it in a very sincere way, and he just left it at that. So naturally I was intrigued (and complimented). It so happened that we also alighted at the same stop, and walked the same way towards the exit. So he started a conversation with me. Turns out he's a sculptor (how cool is that??) and he also teaches that in a college in New Jersey. So I went out with him for a day. 

Hahaha...ok, nobody freak out. It was a totally innocent thing, we just walked around Central Park and chatted. He's a very interesting guy, and because he's 35, a lot more mature too. It was just nice to talk to him and learn about life in general. He said that when he was 25, he also travelled around Europe, and that it was an amazing thing to do because you learn so much about the world, and ultimately about yourself.

I'd like to be where he is at 35. He's figured out what he loves to do and he does it for a living. He's decided that life is not all about money and its better to be happy. (and he actually lives his beliefs)

Isn't that what travelling is really about? Meeting someone from halfway around the world, spending a day with them, finding out the way they view life and the world, and learning. It was a beautiful day. :)"

"event","Yes, the fun packed 3 days we had from Sun-Tues was a road trip!!!

Rented a car and drove up to Boston, first thing we did after we arrived was look for lobsters to eat! YUMMY!!! And that was the first of many! Haha...

The lobsters are legendary! They just need to boil it, and it tastes SOOO good!!! Mmmm...

Boston is such a pretty place! Lots of old buildings and lovely architecture. Nice.

The next day, we drove up to Vermont (Tugk, you were there!) and went to the 
BEN & JERRY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY!!!! (Tugk, did you go???)

It was really cute! Its my happy place! I wanna work there!!! Did you know that every employee gets to take home not one, not two, but THREE pints of ice cream DAILY!?!?!? What more can a girl ask for?

Decided to drive up to Maine after the factory tour coz there was quite alot of time, so off we went! To have lobsters again! YUMMY!!! :) Had to have Maine lobsters! They were good!

Went back to Boston that night, and the next day was a relaxed walk around Boston just shopping basically. Sis bought me a really REALLY nice Banana Republic dress (my early christmas present!) and it was actually really cheap! (so I got cheated of a better christmas present...hahaha just kidding sis!)

The highlight of the trip really worth mentioning though, was the final lobster dinner. We decided to up the stakes and order a 2 1/4 lb lobster as well as a Durgin steak (shared between 3 of us).

             WHOA!!!

             AWESOME!!!

That's all we can say. It was THE MOST WONDERFUL lobster of all! It was the BEST lobster dinner in the history of lobster dinners! Even Paul and my sis felt it was the best they've had, and they've had lots!

The steak too, was amazing! All in all, that dinner was worth the trip up to Boston! (And trust me, that trip really busted my wallet!)"

There's been lots happening the past week or so! First of all, I met up with my SISTER and her husband in NY!!! Haven't seen my sis for 3 months, so it was very nice! :)

Very blessed to be able to stay in my sis' friend's apartment, so we don't have to pay for lodging (phew!) 

New York is such an amazing place! Its HUGE, and so vibrant, and so exciting! So many things happening all at the same time, you just don't know what to do first!

Haven't actually done much of the actual sightseeing, but will be here for another few days so I can take my time! Will be staying with Liwen from tonight! Long time NCC friend! :) Yeah! Can't wait to meet and catch up!!!

We had so much fun the past few days its not right to put them all in one journal entry, so I'll separate it! Hehehe...

Oh yeah, I've changed my travel plans now, since I've almost covered all that I wanna see in US, I've decided to go to Europe instead! (Also coz Tim can't get his US visa approved, and he's joining me to travel for the next 2 months.)

Yep, so things are looking very exciting! :D"

"event","Although it probably didn't make the news back home, over here in the US, Hurricane Frances was a pretty big deal. So as we were in Orlando watching the weather channel each day, the forecast of Hurricane Frances grew more and more ominous. It seemed almost certain that the storm was going to hit Florida.

So we decided we should try to leave Orlando for Atlanta earlier than planned. We had booked our bus tickets for Saturday morning, which meant that we would be on the bus during the hurricane. Not a good idea! Instead, we took our chances and went to the Greyhound station early on Friday morning (5.30am to be exact) and managed to get our tickets changed to a day earlier. I think they were more flexible because of the hurricane.

It was really quite an experience! There were all these people lining up for the bus, and we had to wait 2 hours, so we just sat on the floor of the station doing nothing! But praise the Lord, we managed to get seats on the bus and got out of the hurricane's path in time!

We watched the news about the hurricane, and it looked quite bad! So glad we left when we did!

Anyway, now I'm in Atlanta with Theresa, Tanya has split from the group (no more Charlie's Angels...sob!) and we're staying with a friend from camp. Atlanta's a pretty nice city, very friendly people, and its home to Coca Cola! We're going to the factory today! :) Yeah!"

""KEY LARGO, Montego...oooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo...""

So anyway, we went to Key Largo! It was stunning! I was lazing on a deck chair at the waterfront, just staring out into the horizon, and it was soooo good. Totally chill-out! I love it!

AND I went diving!!! It was soooo cool! We saw this beautiful (and huge) Spotted Eagle Ray! Whoa, it was awesome! And this huge snapper fish, and the corals there were beautiful! Wow...

The awful thing was I got so seasick after my first dive I couldn't do the 2nd dive...sheesh, dumb of me not to have taken my Dramamine before going out to sea. Oh well...

So now, I'm in Orlando, and we're going to Universal Studios tomorrow! Its gonna be so much fun too! Yeah yeah yeah!!!"

We've been just bumming around on the beach, walking around and shopping. This place is a chick's paradise! There are SOOO many shops with cheap clothes, and there are tons of clubs as well! The nightlife here is legendary! We went to this place called ""Reserved"" on Mon night, and as we were walking back to the hostel, we got hassled by lots of people asking us to go into their clubs for free. Which was a bummer because we had to pay $10 for cover at the club we were at...sheesh!

Anyway, guess where I am now? At an Apple store, using the internet for free! Hehehe...we came to this gigantulous mall called Aventura Mall, and we're planning on going to a salsa club later tonight. 

Talking about salsa, yesterday we went to Biscayne Bay and there was this free open air concert, and they were playing salsa music!!! So naturally I was very excited, and was teaching Theresa (one of my travelling buddies) the basic step, when this salsa instructor saw me and asked to dance with me. And I did. Right in front of everyone else! It was fun but also rather embarrassing because I hate dancing in front of people when nobody else is dancing. Its just weird!

Oh, we've been staying at this hostel with like 8 beds in the room, and its cool because we made friends with this guy, Matt. Matt's got a car and we're going to go scuba diving at Key Largo (Florida Keys) tomorrow till Sat! Ain't that cool?!? I love this kind of holiday, where we just make plans as we go along! :)

So tomorrow, Matt will drive us all down to Key Largo in the evening, and we'll go diving on Friday. On Sat, we'll drive all the way down to Key West, before heading back up here to go to Orlando for Disneyworld!

I love my life!!! :D"

Everybody was just letting loose, and all the counsellors really didn't care very much about being on time and all that! Hahaha...our attitude wasn't fantastic, but well, nobody bothered anyway!

So, guess where I'm typing this update? In FLORIDA!!!! Just reached Fort Lauderdale about 1 1/2 hours ago, checked into our hostel and now, the adventure begins! The SERIOUS one!!! Wow! Its so exciting!!! All this time I've been looking forward to travelling, and now its finally happening!!! :D

I can't wait!!! Tomorrow, we'll be going to Miami Beach, so we won't really be seeing much of Fort Lauderdale. But nevermind! Probably we'll walk around for a couple of hours in the afternoon before catching our Greyhound ride. My gosh!!! I'M IN FLORIDA!!!!!!!! EHEHEHEHEHHEHE!!!!!

Its HOT here, by the way! Kinda reminds me of home...in fact, it is probably the same weather here...sigh, go halfway around the world to get just as hot and sticky as I would back in Singapore...

And oh, I got a package from my dearest sister!!!! THANKS JIE!!!! I LOVE YOU!!! The jacket is cool! I'm gonna use it! :)
I got the card from church friends as well! :) So cool!!! I love you all!!! Thanks so much! 

Ok, that's all for now, its too hot here! I gotta go shower and sleep and get ready for the great adventure tomorrow!!!

Its over!!! Camp is officially over!!! Yesterday we had our last camp day, and just now we had a farewell/ appreciation breakfast. :(

Its so sad! Everyone's leaving and going back home, and I'll probably never see most of them again! *TEAR*

I've still got a week of camp though, so I'm really excited about that, but the 2 closest friends that I've made (my ""Only-oners"" or ""Singulars"" group)ie Magnus (Sweden) and Sarah (Germany) are both leaving today. *BAWL*
Hopefully I'll get to visit them in their countries one day.

The last week of camp was rather emotionally draining. My best camper started getting really difficult, because she's the type who wants her way, otherwise she gets this attitude. So sometimes she's still nice, but sometimes she just tries her best to make a nuisance of herself. Which is such a pity because all throughout the other 5 weeks of camp prior to this, she had been a real darling. Oh well.

My last day of camp was less emotional that I thought it would be. I didn't even cry, and surprisingly I didn't even cry today as well when I said goodbye to all the other counsellors who were leaving. I feel really sad though...some tugging feeling in my tummy...

I DID cry at this Jesus play the skit team put up yesterday, it was really powerful and I just pray that the campers were touched by it and would know more about God's love for them. That's what I feel most emotional about.  

Well, I'm just looking forward to next week of camp. Its going to be so fun because its much more relaxed and scaled down, and in a way it'll help with the transition between camp and the start of my travelling again. :)

Take care everyone! I miss you all!!!"

I'm so happy because only a very small number of people who apply for it actually get selected, so its a huge pat on the back for me to know that I'm doing a good job! :) And also, I wanted to earn extra money, so I'm glad I got another week of camp! YEAH!!! Thank you God!!!

So right after we got confirmation on the extra week of camp, we got down to discussing travel plans after camp. Now I'll be going to Florida with 2 girls: Tanya (mentioned previously) and Theresa (from New Zealand). We just booked our flights tonight on Jet blue for an incredibly low price of US$69!!! Too blessed!!! :D

I'm so happy! Things are going great for me! Besides the fact that I've got the sniffles (sniff sniff!), camp is going wonderfully!

This session has been great so far. One of my campers who used to ignore me and dislike me has started to warm up to me. (yes, after 6 weeks of camp!) I used to get SOOO bothered by her because I just couldn't figure out why she wasn't happy! But suddenly, she's decided that she'll be friends with me after all! So yeah, its making camp days ALOT easier! Phew!! Thank you Jesus!!!

I'm really enjoying myself so much now! Camp is ending and everyone's a little sad, but we're trying to make the best of the time we have left. So everyone's really giving everything they've got to make this the best session ever. Cool eh? I love this camp! Its amazing!!!"

Weekends are the best part of camp because we work so hard during the week, so we totally treasure the time we have to go out and have fun. On Friday night, we went to watch The Bourne Supremacy. (which I heard has not opened in S'pore yet! Haha! I beat ya!) It was alright, although I much preferred the first one. This sequel went quite slowly, and after you've had a tiring camp day, its hard to concentrate on plot developments.

Yesterday we had a staff trip to Baltimore Inner Harbour, and well, it was nice but there wasn't really much to see. We just went shopping at the mall and took a little boat ride around the harbour. It was a nice relaxing day. :) 

We're already starting to make plans for travel after camp, and that's sooo exciting! I'm thinking of going to Florida and Miami (SALSA!!!) and also to the Bahamas (if my pockets don't protest too much). Then after that, go up to New York and Boston. I'm so hyped up now! Yeah yeah yeah! Can't wait to travel!!!
At this point, I've found one travel buddy, Tanya, from South Africa. Its so cool because she was thinking of going to the exact same places as I want to go, and also we both want to do an extra 2 weeks of work after camp officially ends. Divine isn't it?"

Hahaha...for those of you who've been irritated by my hyper-happiness of having an amazing experience, yes, the bubble is starting to deflate...not really by anything bad, but just by the sheer exhaustion of it all!

Its more than halfway through camp now, and i've got 3 weeks more to go. Its been really awesome and totally unforgettable, but the toll is finally being felt. I guess its just because I'm the type of person who doesn't know how to rest properly! I just keep doing stuff and going out even though I should be resting during the weekends! Oh well! (here's when mommy would go ""that girl never learns!"" hehe)

So things have been falling into a rather boring routine, because we have the same programme every session, and there are 4 sessions. I guess the challenge now is trying to be enthusiastic about each day even if I find it boring and difficult. That's where the endurance comes in. I need the grace of God!!!

Well, nothing much interesting has happened this week, so yeah, just a short note to let you guys know I'm still here!

My hall friend, Teguh, came to Washington DC to visit!!! It was soooo fabulous!!!! I had so much fun!!!

There's nothing like meeting up with a good friend in a foreign country! There's this nice tingly feeling that feels so good, and actually, now that he's left again, I miss home even more!!! :(

I so appreciate Tugk coming by DC because he had to take a detour specially for me. But yeah, it was sooo fun and soooo great!!! And because he was on a business trip, we had meals and accom taken care of! (Thanks, Tugk's company!)

The cool thing was we went to a really cool club on Sat night, its called ""Air"" and it is an open air dance floor, located in this enclave of really nice buildings. Seriously cool!

On Sunday, we managed a comprehensive walking tour of almost all the important sights of DC including the White House, Lincoln and Jefferson Memorial, and Washington Monument.

I was so psyched that I could be in the capital of the US on Independence Day! So I was determined to go to DC on Sunday, even though it was raining.

It was like a United Nations outing - our group of 4 consisted of a white Swedish guy called Magnus, a white South African girl, Liz, a black American guy, Ivory, and myself! Hahaha...

We went to Chinatown for lunch, and walked around a bit. But the day was rather gloomy because it was cloudy and it kept raining. So we got really wet and cold, coz there was like only one umbrella between the 4 of us. We went to see the Lincoln Memorial, which is really cool and reminded me of Logan' Run! (remember that show, Daddy?) Also saw some other memorials and stuff, but it was so cloudy and dreary the pictures didn't turn out too nicely. (oh yeah, I still haven't uploaded more pictures. Too lazy!)

Walked to the Washington Monument to get a good spot for the fireworks, and just lay on a poncho on the wet grass field until fireworks started. But wow!!! The fireworks were definitely worth it! They went on for like 20 minutes and it was just wild! We were like just sitting there open mouthed, and clapping and cheering when the really nice ones came up. It was cool!!!

Its also really nice to see how patriotic Americans are! Everyone was wearing their national colours and all the ridiculous hats and hair accessories with the US flags. It was really fun!

Yeah, so now I've seen the 4th of July, Independence Day, in the capital of the nation! I'm sooo pleased with myself! Hehehe...:)"

Last weekend was also rather tiring because we had an overnighter from Friday night to Saturday morning, and then after that the counsellors all went to Washington DC for a day trip. So at the end of that I was totally exhausted!

Well, anyway, as I was saying, its the end of the first session! I have 4 sessions of camp, and we're done with the first! So 3 more to go! Wow, time really flies! I can't believe we're 1/4 way through already! Kinda fast!

It was such an incredible first session! I had so much fun and I loved the kids! And its so nice to see them respond affectionately too! There are some girls that are SOOO lovable I just wanna bring them home!! Hahaha...

Yesterday was the last day of the session, and some of the campers in my group were not going to return for another session, so it was rather sad. :( We had a farewell party at our ""fort"", which is like a little house we built in the woods with branches and stuff. Its really cool! 

I love weekends! Its the only time we get to relax and do our personal stuff. Just went to open a bank account and roam around the dollar store near our dorm, which was really fun! 

Tomorrow I'm planning to go up to Washington DC (yes, again!) to celebrate the 4th of July! Its gonna be so awesome!

The girls in my group are such darlings! And some of them are sooo cute I just wanna hug them all day long! But of course, there are also some rather more difficult ones, so its going to be a challenge for me as camp goes on.

The biggest test, I think, is endurance. The camp job lasts for 8 weeks, and I'm barely done with my first week and I'm SOOOO tired already! The thought ""How on earth am I going to get through the rest of the summer??"" keeps running through my mind...but hey, the answer from God is simple: ""One day at a time!"" Hahaha...cool!

The really best part of this camp is how focused it is on God! Every morning, before we start the day, there is morning devotion, where we sing one or two christian songs, and someone shares a simple message. Its a great way to start the day, and I'm really growing so much spiritually! Love it!

Tomorrow will be an EXTREMELY long day as we have overnighter, where the campers stay overnight. Well, it'll be fun! (hopefully!) I'm so incredibly blessed that I'm not working in a camp where campers stay EVERY night! :D

On Saturday, we'll be going to Washington DC for a day trip! Yeah! Looking forward to that too!!

After all the anticipation and training, we finally started camp today! Kids started coming in at 8.45am and we waited till 9.30 for all the campers to arrive. Meeting the girls for the first time was so exciting, and getting to know them today was sooo enjoyable!

I've never really done a camp where I have to be in charge of 10 girls at the same time, so it was quite a novel experience! I guess one thing I realised is that Asians are more ""worrisome"" than Americans. So I was like more naturally cautious about safety and stuff. But I want the girls to have fun, so I didn't really nag too much. 

I think alot of things slipped out of my mind, but alot of things were also natural to me. So the day went really well, without much trouble. 

The part where I was a little freaked out was when we went to the public pool, and there were lots of groups there, as well as outsiders (non-campers) and it was IMPOSSIBLE to keep track of the girls in my group. But in the end, all went well, no missing campers! (Praise the Lord!)

By the end of the day, I was really exhausted! But very happy! :) I really like this camp! I think the girls in my group are all darlings, and real sweeties!

Shirley? Vanessa?) please email me! Hehehe...

Ok, I'm a little incoherent in this entry, because I'm really tired! Gotta sleep soon..."

I'm staying in a dorm called Columbia Union! :) I'm really excited because at first, I was supposed to be staying at a host home, which had only 2 other girls there, so I was thinking it'll be rather boring! But now I've got like 50 other girls here to make friends with! :) 

And dorms are so much more fun!!! :) I missed hall so much after graduation, and now its like hall again! HOORAY!!!

I've got 2 roommates, one from South Africa, and the other from US. The coolest thing is that Sabrina, the US girl, has ALL these stuff from home, coz she drove and she could dump like her whole room in there. So now we've got a CAR, a PHONE, and a LAPTOP with INTERNET CONNECTION!!!! in our room!!! :D 

That's soooo cool!!! I'm so incredibly blessed!!!! hehehe...

Yep, so I can keep updating my blog and stuff! Ain't that superb??? :) Things are just looking great from here!"

"event","Its welcome weekend, which means ALL the counsellors report for camp today. Its pretty cool! Lotsa lotsa new people to meet and make friends with. 

Well, the past 2 days have been rather slow, nothing much going on, but we watched Shrek 2 yesterday!!! It was soooo funny! Loved the movie!!! The camp kinda treated us to the movie. So nice of them! :)

Funny thing was, last night, I suddenly felt really lonely, and kinda homesick, and rather sad. I didn't even understand why I was feeling that way because its been really fun and all the people here are so nice and friendly. But well, yeah, I did. I guess that's kinda like homesickness + culture shock together, because for the first time in my life, I'm the ONLY Asian in the whole group. I mean, not just Singapore, but none from Korea, Japan, Thailand, whatever! So this is total cultural immersion! Whoa...

Well, I'm ok today, there's a foosball table in the hall where we're sleeping in, and its been awesome! hehehe...I love playing table soccer! Kinda missed it when I left hall. I'm kicking some serious ass! hehehe..

Okies, its dinner time now (really early huh?) so I've gotta go. Next update would probably be about training week. Hope everyone back home is doing fine!!!"

"event","Ok, after getting the Madonna madness out of the system, here's the actual update for the day.

Checked in to my flight at 5am today in San Jose (crazy hour to be up, but well...) Many many thanks to Uncle Andrew, Auntie Alice and their 2 wonderful kids, Elaine and Nicholas, for an awesome time at their place. :) Also a shout of thanks to Terence for sending me to the airport at that ungodly hour.

First time on a budget airline, so it was quite an experience! Had to queue up at the boarding area 1/2 hour before boarding, and then the good thing was I managed to get an aisle seat.(not a middle one, phew!)

Promptly fell asleep, which was a good thing in a plane like that! (Hehe, yes yes, I'm spoilt by SQ business class!) 
When I arrived, I was slightly anxious that I wouldn't be able to find the camp representative that would meet me at the airport. But praise Jesus, as I was looking for my checked bag, this guy behind me was on the phone and he mentioned my name! So I turned around and voila! Camp Sonshine staff!! :D truly divine timing!

Rest of the day was spent picking up other girls arriving by train and stuff, then going to the camp and meeting lotsa other international counsellors. Turns out I'm like the only Asian here for now, and the first Singaporean the camp has ever hired! So its pretty exciting!

Not much happening now because the camp is just letting everyone get over jetlag. And since I've already done that 2 weeks ago, I'm just having a good time relaxing! :D

Tune in for more adventures soon!!!"

"event","This post is a little late, but I had to put one specially to let everybody know that 

I WENT TO A MADONNA CONCERT IN SAN JOSE!!!!!!!!!!!

Its the single most exciting thing that's happened on my trip so far! I mean, I found out abt the concert like on Mon, then on Tues, I just decided to try my luck at the ticket office just before the concert, and GOODNESS, they STILL had tickets!!!

I bought the cheapest seat in the house, US$45 for a behind the stage seat (well, not directly behind, but it was angled behind). But it was so cool already, just being at the concert! And there were these big screens anyway, so I could see what was happening. 

Best part was that halfway through, I noticed how people were leaving and not coming back, so I figured they had sneaked into another sector, and so I went and sneaked into a better area too! It was sooo much better, I could actually SEE her!!!

HOORAY!!! I'm so happy!!! Hehehe...well, its just that I've always liked Madonna and Singapore didn't let her in last time for her concert, so I'm just really excited that I got to see her. She was FANTASTIC!!! Sang alot of her old songs, and some new ones, and the cool ones like Music, and Die Another Day. It was just AWESOME!!!"

"event","Took a day trip to San Francisco today. It was quite an event in itself, managing to get lost a total of 4 times today!

First of all, the Caltrain station that I was supposed to get off at was called ""4th and King Street"". How is ANYONE to know that that's the station to get to downtown San Francisco???

Secondly, the public transportation system is so confusing that even after staring at the map for forever, I still could not figure it out! And directions from people were so vague as well. Oh well, not like I had much to do anyway!

In any case, even with getting lost and stuff, I still managed to see Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Alcatraz. Not too bad for a day!

Alcatraz was kinda gloomy! Could imagine how the inmates must have felt in that little cell, with no freedom at all! I think it almost comes close to being stuck in the office! (not quite though) Reminds me of this little book I read last time about prison vs the office. At least prison is better - you get free meals! Haha!!

And man, San Francisco is WINDY!!! It was so cold it wasn't funny. Couldn't tell its summer at all! 

Will be going again tomorrow to walk around more of San Francisco, and maybe see the slightly less touristy places. I love exploring! :D Woohoo!!!"

"event","Today was train travelling day...gosh, I spent TWELVE hours on the train! No joke!

Well, it was really fun at first, we went by the ocean road and the view was fantastic! There was the Pacific on the left, and rolling hills on the right. Awesome!!!

But after about say, 6 hours, it kinda got boring.

The next interesting thing was the dinner coach. Its just like in the movies!!! It was pricey, but i guess I'd only be doing this once, so can splurge lah! Not extravagent food, but just a nice experience.

Well, nothing much else happened today, so this will be a short entry. 

I'm in San Jose now, staying with my parents' friends. Yep, I'm glad I've got somewhere to bunk for a few days! :)"

"event","So as it turns out, I decided to stay in LA on Venice beach till Friday, and boy has it been fun!!!

I checked myself into this really cool hostel right along the fun and excitement. Its called ""Venice Beach Costel"" with a great view of the beach and attached bathroom. (but its a little pricier than other hostels...oh well!!!)

Anyway, today was a really fun day!!!

Woke up in my hostel room to a glorious view of Venice beach, it was sooo amazing it was rather surreal!

Went for a brunch (what I usually do nowadays to save money) and then walked around and found the Venice beach canals. The story goes that some crazy marketing guy had built these canals in the past! Well, it kinda worked, Venice beach IS a tourist attraction now, but not coz of the canals! Hahaha...the houses flanking the canals were beautiful though!

After walking around, this friend I met from the hostel, Kev, and I decided to go boogie boarding!!! It was SOOO FUN!!!!
The water was FREEZING at first, but once I got over that, it was awesome!!! So much fun!!! :D

Anyway, so that's all that's happened for now. Will update again!!!

Hope everyone back home is doing great!! :D"

"event","Reported for my CCUSA orientation yesterday. Feel like a kid again! Hehehe...played a few games and acted silly...but wait.. then again, i feel OLD coz everybody here is so young!!!

Stayed a night at the Furama, which is actually pretty decent and much better for a budget traveller like moi. There were public telephones at the ground floor, and even washing machines!!! AND no need to tip!!! (HOORAY!!!)

Well, today after settling social security, I'm pretty much free till camp starts. Hmm...but I have no plans!!! Eeeks!!!
So here I am at the public library using the free internet access, wondering what I should do for the next 8 days!! But I guess that's what my trip is all about..going with the flow! 

Tune in for the next update to see how things turn out! I'm as clueless as you are!!!"

The very very sad fact is that he's leaving today...sniff! This would probably be my last update for a while. Unless I'm resourceful enough to find an internet cafe somewhere...

So anyhow, yesterday, we went to Venice beach. It was waaaay cool!!! There's this free-spiritedness and beauty about it that's hard to describe, but yeah, its also kinda tacky in ways, but I think it adds to the charm!

I love this place! It rocks!!!"

Well, this WAS the whole point of coming to LA first instead of going directly to the east coast for my summer camp! I'm glad it was worth all the trouble!!

Performances were dazzling, the atmosphere fantastic, and the live music and dancing, incredible! wow!!! But sadly, I'm freaking broke now...thanks to US$40 per night entrance fee! Goodness, that's like a BIIIIG hole in my pocket!

The other thing about dancing into the night is that we kinda lose the days! hahaha...end up sleeping in and not doing much, but hey, that's the way, uh huh uh huh, i like my holidays!!!

So hehe, dun ask me what I've seen of LA! :P but I've been to the cool shopping areas like Rodeo Dr and Melrose Ave, and also Santa Monica beach! Planning to see Venice beach later, hopefully...:)"

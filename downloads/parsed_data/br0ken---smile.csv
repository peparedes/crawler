But it's time to get back to the basics.  I never have actually gone off the program, but I stopped being so perfect about journaling, and I'm letting myself slip.  So before it gets too far, I need to re-commit!  And that also means doing a better job reading/commenting/updating in this journal!

But it never fit, it wouldn't come close to wrapping all the way around my waist.  Yesterday, I was wearing a pink and green striped shirt and thought to myself ""that alligator belt would look so cute, maybe I'll see if I'm anywhere near to being able to wear it yet...""  So I tried it on, and the belt fit!  Not only did it fit, it had like 2-3 inches to spare!  I was soooo pumped.

I was sooooo worried all week because I'm a compulsive weigher, and it appeared that although I hadn't really cheated or done anything wrong, I had gained about 3 pounds this week... but when I woke up yesterday morning (my weigh-in day), somehow all that weight had disappeared and by the time I went to my weigh-in last night, I was actually down a pound from last week, so woo hoo!  Down to 233.5-- only 8.5 pounds left to go until I reach my birthday goal (april 6)!!!

Recipe Request:
I would like to eat more fish, but I live with my parents and right now all my mom cooks is frozen salmon in the oven--- she says she's willing to cook me anything I want, but she just doesn't know how to cook any other fish that isn't too expensive or too complex.  Sooooo if any of you have *simple* fish recipes, I would really appreciate it if you'd pass them along!!!!!!"

It's with a law firm, to be a clerk for the summer... however, apparently they want the person to start asap... so that kinda sucks because I don't want to be working at a firm *and* going to school, but if that's what it takes to get a job for the summer, I guess I'll have to be happy doing it.  

The new *size 18 regular* suit worked very well-- I felt great in it!  So hopefully they thought I looked great too!

"event","So here's my non-scale victory of the week:

kinda long-winded, so I'll put it behind a cut

<lj-cut>

On Tuesday I said to myself, ""well self, it looks like no one is going to come knocking on your door and offer you a job for the summer, so you better start applying for some on your own.""  Sooooo, I found the addresses of 10 firms in my area that specialize in estate planning (because that's what I want to do) and sent off my cover letter and resume on Tuesday evening.  Well, Thursday the secretary from one of the firms called and set up an interview with me for this coming Thursday.  Well, this is great and all-- but I didn't really think people would respond to my random solicitations for employment, and had NOTHING to wear to said interview.

So today, I went into the little ""downtown"" area near my house to try to find some clothes.  There's a Talbot's Women's store that I figured would have a suit.... or at least there USED to be a Talbot's Women's store (up until a few days ago) but it is now closed.  So I went down the block to their regular store.... and low and behold, I fit into their size 18 suit!  Are you freaking kidding me?  I fit into clothing from a regular sized store, and it isn't like a stretchy t-shirt or sweater!  It's a SUIT!  Go me!!!  It made me want to walk around the store and buy everything they had to offer just because it would fit--- but I don't want to buy a lot at this size because it's not my ultimate goal, so paying $350 for a suit was enough money wasting for the day.  

</lj-cut>

Yeah, so I am elated to say the least!

I did 10 minutes on the treadmill to warm up, then 35 minutes lifting, then 45 minutes on the elliptical (3.35 miles, pyramid resistance)... and doing weights first certainly made some sort of change in the workout because by the end, I honestly thought I was either going to pass out or throw up (thankfully neither of the two <i>actually</i> happened)-- but in a good way, if that's even possible.  Sooooo hopefully this new change to the workout will bring with it positive results!!

I never thought the day would arrive when someone in the gym was impressed by something I was able to do.  That just made me smile so much-- in fact, I am still smiling about it!!

So what if I was the fattest person in the room?  At least I'm taking positive steps to do something about it :-)

"event","Well, I missed week 10 because I was in Jamaica for the week between Christmas and New Years, but here I am back in the U.S. and back on track.  I was so worried about going to weigh in tonight because I had missed last week, so since my last weigh-in there was Christmas parties and a whole week of vacation including new years, so the potential for gain was pretty high, but the good news is that I lost a pound and a half, earning me my 25 pound magnet!  The bad news is that I was still 1 pound shy of making it to my new years goal-- but one pound isn't SO bad, therefore I am overall pleased with myself.

It was amazing how differently I behaved on vacation than the pre-Weight Watchers me would have behaved.  In the whole week I was gone I only had two glasses of wine and no other alcohol--- and this was while staying at an all-inclusive resort with free booze!  The old me would have had about 10 strawberry daquiris each day, but the new me is finding it easier and easier to say no to temptation.  I'm not going to lie, I did use up and go over all my flex points, but it could have been waaaaaay worse.  I was making much better decisions about what I put in my mouth than I ever have before, AND I made sure to journal everything, even the points that went over!

The dissapointment set in when I stepped on the scale and had gained a pound.... might be because I was wearing shoes (since I didn't have socks on I couldn't take them off)... might be because I'm retaining water... might be because I only ate 14 points yesterday and my body went into starvation mode... might be a lot of things, but I don't want to make excuses-- I gained the pound, and now it's time to loose it and make up for it at next week's weigh-in.

"event","So I've been doing weight watchers for six weeks now, and today I came across my first major non-scale victory :-)

My parents and I are taking SCUBA diving classes, which require us to wear a lot of crazy equipment.  One of the pieces is a buoyancy control device, which is like a vest that you wear that can blow up with air to help you float... well, the best thing ever happened today when I put mine on, I could get the velcro that goes around my stomach to go about two or three inches farther than I could when we started these classes!  Hooray!

I'm refusing to invest in a wetsuit until my thin body comes out-- no need to buy one that will fit me at this stage of the game, this body will be leaving us and a new one will be here eventually at the end of the weight loss journey!!!

Hope you're all having positive days :-)"

"event","Well I made it through Thanksgiving successfully-- Yahoooo!  I was sure I was going to see a gain on that scale last night when I went to the meeting, so I convinced myself I'd be happy with maintainging-- however, I managed to lose two more pounds!!!  What an amazing program-- it really works when you do what you're told to do :-)

Just wanted to drop in a quick update... I had my weigh-in last night marking my first month with the program and we discussed how to get through thanksgiving without totally ruining everything we've worked for, so I feel like tomorrow will be fine.  The main thing that I'm worried about is that my parents are planning a SCUBA-diving trip to Jamaica for us to go on between Christmas and New Years at an all-inclusive place that gives you FREE DRINKS all day.  I could live off of yummy fruity drinks, but I know they're hella bad.  Guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there...

"event","I have found a great way to stop myself from unnecessary snacking-- any time I feel like putting something in my mouth, I brush my teeth instead!  I hate eating right after I brush because then I lose the ""so fresh and so clean"" feeling inside my mouth.  It's a quick fix, and great for the dental health too!!

"event","A few random thoughts:

1. So I have finally gotten really good about drinking tons and tons of water every day-- but the only problem is that two days a week I am an intern for a federal judge... so having to go to the bathroom really badly in the middle of a hearing is never a comfortable thing!

2. Lately I've been finding myself getting to the end of the day with points leftover-- mainly because I have breakfast, then pack a lunch then am not home until dinner time so I don't have a chance to snack or anything-- and if I'm just eating what I pack for lunch in the morning, there's not much room for error. I know I'm SUPPOSED to eat all my points each day so my body doesn't think I'm starving it--- but I always feel like it's so counter-productive to mow down on food in the evening just to finish up some leftover daily points.

3. I went and got my hair trimmed yesterday and my hair dresser told me that I was looking thinner to her! I mean, it's kinda their job to try to butter up the customers so we keep coming back-- but there must have been *some* basis for her to think to mention it!!

Okay, those are enough random ramblings for the time being.... Hope this week is going well for everyone!!!"

Washcloth is smaller version of baby blanket I posted a while back; scrubbie is sewn in parallelegram shape, then short ends sewn, then long ends gathered.  (Left one unfunished so you could get the idea.)

That cast on 5 and knit in the round is a BITCH!  The only other time I've done that before has been on felted stuff and it usually doesn't matter how it looks so I didn't sweat it so much but I've spent the whole morning casting on, knitting, and ripping this out, lol.  I think I've finally got it the first two rounds and am ready to do the first row of increases and hope I don't screw it up because I don't think I can bear restarting again.  Ugh.

Just getting around to putting this one up.  Double-strand of Homespun (beige and ""Tudor"") on *I think* size 11 needles?  Maybe 13s.  It's a great pattern off the Lion Brand site that's essentially knit 3, yo, knit to last 3, yo, knit to end until it's half as big as you want, then you reverse it.  I ran out of tudor about 6 inches away from the end, so that part is purple and conveniently not shown in the picture, heh.

On the needles: a sleeveless turtleneck for my mom.  About 3/4 done; just have to finish up the neck shaping, make the neck and seam the sides."

"event","<b>Trixie Belden & the mysterious upside-down cat bed/Trixie Belden and the mysteriously small slippers</b>
<lj-cut>The first project was the ""Kitty Pi"" bed from this link: http://wendyknits.net/knit/kittybed.htm  It's supposed to be one of those beds that's like a big fluffy bowl for the cats to lay in (As you can see by the picture).  MINE however turned out really narrow at the top and I was too impatient to block it into shape so I just left it on the floor and it dried into a flat sort of beret shape.  My cats both turned their noses up at it so I flipped it over so the opening was at the bottom and it made a sort of giant concave beret.  NOW you can't get Garfunkel out of the thing - he loves it!  I still have a buttload of wool left that's too scratchy for anything else, so I'll probably make another one for upstairs on the bed.
<img src=""http://tinypic.com/f0rshz.jpg"">

Next we have the slippers made from this pattern:  http://knitting.about.com/library/blslippers6.htm  As you can see by the author's notes, these should fit an ""average woman's foot.""  However, unless the average woman is 7 years-old, I don't think that's the case.  They turned out totally small so I'll have to give them to one of my friends with kids or something. 

<img src=""http://tinypic.com/f0rsl5.jpg"">

I figured ""Well, that was double worsted on size 9 needles, lets try size 13 needles and some heavier yarn.""  So I ended up with this, which ended up just about perfect:

<img src=""http://tinypic.com/f0rsro.jpg"">

That's made of a double strand of the yarn from my Coronet hat last year; it's what I'd consider heavy worsted or light bulky,  About the weight of Lion Brand Thick & Quick bulky yarn.  I didn't make the bottom as wide (I think 8 rows instead of the 12 rows suggested) and I only knitted a few rows of ribbing for the cuff, because I figured more was overkill.  Very toasty for sitting around the house!</lj-cut>

I have ONE SEAM left on my nephew's sweater.  Hopefully it'll be up soon."

This is loosely based on the Kittyville Hat from Stitch & Bitch (among other various places.)  It's for a 3-year-old so I made it on size six needles with worsted weight yarn and used the same number of cast-on stitches as the original pattern, which is for thicker yarn/bigger needles.  I didn't want to make the earflaps/cords, so I just made a ribbed edge, and I shortened up the length some so it wouldn't be so long on the child's head. I also changed the ears because seed-stitch sucks.  I knocked this out in a few hours - yay for tiny projects!

This yarn is courtesy of <lj user=""joeythegirl"">'s basement stash!

This is for my neice who will be *I think* around 12 this Xmas.  It's a combination of two patterns: the bottom is a feather and fan pattern I got the idea from a sweater in the latest Vogue Knitting, and the capelet itself is slightly modified from the basic caplet pattern in one of the recent Interweave Knits issues.  (I think Spring or Summer.)  Instead of binding off at the neckline, I added a double-strand of Fun Fur and knit in garter-stitch for a few inches to make the collar.  I managed to bang this out in a week, and best of all?  NO SEAMING!  Second best - it only took a skein and a half of Homespun.  CHEAP!  I had bought 3 skeins because I was thinking of making a sweater, so now I have enough left over to make one for another neice.  Yay!

I have a sweater I recently finished for nephew, but it still has to be seamed.  Ugh.  It's been mocking me for like 3 weeks now.</lj-cut>

This was originally supposed to be for my brother's daughter, who is 6.  It turned out CRAZY small though, like baby-sized.  (I tried to use an adult pattern and just use smaller yarn & needles.  Didn't quite work!)  I will probably give it to my friend Shirley who has a 2-year-old.  If it doesn't fit HER then they can use it on their dolls or something.

I ended up using a variation of the same pattern to knit a capelet for my sister-in-law's daughter, who is I think 12 or 13.  It turned out great and I'll post a pic as soon as I get the button & loop put on."

I don't know if it's just my monitor or what, but I can never see the stitches in dark knitted stuff, so I turned the brightness way up in my photo editor so you can see it better.  I was too lazy to learn the weavey seam for the toe, so I just did 3-needle bindoff and it looks craptacular, but who sees the toe anyway?

This pattern was for a full length sock where you fold the top over, but after like 3 hours of tiny ribbing I declared ""these are going to be anklets!""  I dropped a stitch in the heel gusset on the other side, but it doesn't really show *that* much - you get to see the side I didn't screw up.

This is knit with triple stranded super fine alpaca yarn.  It should be super warm, but I'm not sure how it will wear.  (I'm hearing reports that it doesn't have much memory, so it might get all stretched out - oh well.)"

I confess I left out the last two neck decreases because I wanted it to look less like a tank top, but I wasn't expecting it to look like an ACTUAL tank!  (More like a bulletproof vest, lol.)  I might actually make this pattern again.  If I do, I'll bind off less stitches for the neck, and cast off a couple more stitches in the armpits so the shoulders aren't so dang broad!  Also I'll do the bottom part in the round because I think one side is longer and it just looks crappy.  Oh, and I'll add a couple ribs around the waist.  And maybe make it a little longer.  

Do you recognize the yarn?  Farewell Enormous Poncho of Doom!  (I acutally still have the half with the cable, which makes a nice scarf/wrap.)  Very warm vest, though.  Maybe it won't look so wonky over like a knit shirt or something?  Hmm."

First I had the trauma of finding out the ribs didn't line up (which is luckily not THAT noticible - like you can see it if you're looking for it, but if you didn't know, you probably couldn't tell.)  But I come to find out that I'd been doing mattress stitch wrong for my last dozen or so projects so I had to re-learn it after about 20 failed seaming attempts.  Bleah.  It's kind of stretched-out from the blocking, but hopefully after she (mom) washes it the ribs will scrunch back up some and the stitches will fluff out.  (I tried it on and it's a bit loose, and the collar sticks up over the shoulders because the sleeves were so flattened out blocking it to size!)

"event","I'm getting my ass kicked by knitting lately.  I bound off the vest I was making for my mom and it looked horrible.  I just shoved it aside and didn't seam it or try to block it or anything.  Blech.  I decided to knit her the Bob sweater from Knitty instead, ( http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEspring03/PATTbob.html )because I was going to knit it as practice for fancy yarn anyway.  I decided it would look better in all ribs, instead of some at the bottom and some at the top so I knit them all the way up.  Turns out -- they don't line up!  I continued the ribbing in pattern but now it's going to be off center at the top, and the ribs won't look right around the neck.  GRR!  I'm thinking there's a way to adjust the pattern, so I can still do it for the next project I plan to make, but I'm so annoyed at myself for not checking that first.  (I actually did juggle the numbers in my head, but I must've done it wrong, or not accounted for the bound-off stitches in the armpits.)  Did I mention ""Grr""?  The whole thing is taking forever and my hands are killing me.  I cannot wait for it to be finished!

Haven't done any more on Bruce's slippers - still waiting for Thick & Quick to go on sale.  I was going to break down and buy it at Hancock Fabrics, but they don't carry WHITE!  What is up with that?  I would think white would be one of the more frequently used colors!

Also on the back burner is a knit-a-long project for the crafty bunch on Disgruntled Housewife boards.  The category is ""neckwear"" so I'm planning to use the leftover yarn from my Coronet project to make a button-up gaiter loosely based on a pattern in Knit.1 magazine.  Won't be for a while though, because of the dreaded gift sweater."

I've been winding balls of yarn for days and have a monsterous pile next to my LaZBoy, lol.  I actually need to finish a vest I started for my mom a couple months ago.  It's sort of a pattern I made up in my head by combining two patterns into what she described she wanted, but will probably turn out nothing like it, and too small to boot -- drat!  I'm like 3/4 of the way done, and just need to finish the top front but it's been so long since I picked it up, I'm worried about if I can remember what part of the cable I'm on, etc.  Annoying.

I'm also right in the middle of a UPS Brown skirt that is taking forever, because of the giant size it needs to be to cover my butt without being grotesquely stretched, and a pair of bootie-type slippers for Bruce I'm trying to make look like Chuck Taylor high tops.  I need to buy another skein of Wool Ease Thick & Quick in white, but I refuse to pay full price so I have to wait for it to go on sale somewhere.

When the needles get here I need to start a ribbed sweater.  I'm making it out of some wool-ease I got on eBay as a sort of test pattern.  If it turns out nice, and I can make it out of a certain amount of yarn, then I will be able to make the same pattern out of the super-nice yarn I got for Xmas.  I also have some alpaca on a cone I got off eBay, which I want to use to make a sweater from one of my mom's vintage pattern books.  ALSO I got some bright red wool, so I want to make a rolled brim felted hat.  And possibly some felted pads for the cats to lay on/shred to death with their kneading.

THEN after all that, I need to get the yarn and get started on that sweater/jacket for my dad.

Jo-Anns is having a ""free shipping on any orders over $25"" promotion through Amazon, so I put three sets of bamboo circular needles in my shopping cart and they came to $24.97.  :rolleyes:  I decided to spend another $4 to save $8 in shipping so I threw in a set of DPNs.

The bag is a Lion Brand pattern from one of those free tear-away sheets.  You're supposed to knit the outside of the bag in just fun fur, then knit a lining out of microspun on smaller needles.  Forget that!  I'm far too lazy.  The handles were tedious enough.  I still have to weave in some ends and fluff the fur more on the scarf, but I think it turned out fairly good.

"event","I was excited to see a NEW KNITTING MAGAZINE at the grocery store yesterday: Quick & Easy Knitting & Crocheting by Women's Day.  I can't quite put my finger on why, but it's just striking me as the WORST. MAGAZINE. EVER!  There's like 50000 scarf patterns - hello?  Who needs a pattern to make a scarf?  Then there are hideous afghan patterns - who doesn't have 10 ugly afghans from their grandma already?  It was like half crochet patterns too, which I really hate.  I think knit and crochet magazines should be entirely separate!  ;) I'm not sure who the target audience is for this magazine.  Everything either seemed super-dowdy and old-ladyish, or super in-your-face-extreme trendy.  All the ads and yarns used are the same company, too (Coats & Clark/Red Heart/TLC/modadea) so it's just one big advertisement, really.  I'm going to fill out the little comment page in the back and tell them they're WEAK.

In other news, I finished the knit portion of the one bag I'm making, but I think I'm going to make the other bag and then felt them at the same time (so they will be equally ruined when I screw it up, maybe?)  I had yesterday off so I started my husband's Xmas sweater.  It'll be based on a hooded knit sweatshirt pattern from Lion Brand (not the free one on their site...this one was in a booklet and looks a lot nicer somehow.)  I'm leaving the front pocket off and putting rugby stripes on it, because the only way he'll wear anything is if it already looks like all the other stuff he already has.  I'm about halfway through the first sleeve and it looks AWESOME.  Going to take a long time though, glad I started early.  This will be my first project where I will be doing a placket and picking up stitches for the hood, so I hope I don't screw it up horribly, but I'll worry about that later.

When my mom was here I ended up giving her the blue cardigan I was going to give to my neice.  I figured she'd appreciate it a lot more (and was the original intended recipient anyway - I just wasn't sure about the size.)  I told her she could open it early and try it on and it fit and she loved it.  So I'm midway through making neice a fun fur bag and super-long scarf instead.  That's what I'm working on in the evening when Bruce is home, then I'll get started on that second wool bag, I guess.  I didn't really enjoy the circular knitting because it was really tedious, so I'm putting it off as long as possible."

"event","FINALLY finished my ""adopt-a-sniper"" hat.  Mom is modeling it and does not have the man-sized head it's made for, but if recipient man is small headed he can pull it down and flip the bottom up.  Next one will be ON BIGGER NEEDLES and have less stitches so it won't take so long.  This was ""HotHead"" from the book ""Stitch & Bitch.""

While mom was here she wanted me to re-learn her on knitting, so I grabbed this free pattern from Lion Brand while I was at Michaels and had her make this purse from my leftover shawlcho yarn.  It turned out really good - go mom!

I had shown her all my stuff so far, and she LOVED the fuzzy keyhole scarf, so I made her one with red Fun Fur and a skein of black worsted weight Wool-Ease.  The skein of Wool Ease was nearly exactly long enough to use the skein of fun-fur and make the keyhole and have about 3 or 4 feet leftover.  Nice!  Didn't have time to take a picture, but you can scroll down a few posts if you missed the first one (purple.)"

"event","So I FINALLY finished the ""shawlcho"" I've been working on for what seems like ages (though, it's probably only a couple weeks.)  This is loosely based on this design:   http://www.helloyarn.com/onebaaadponcho.htm  but I didn't have circular needles, so I modified it so I could make two equal-sized strips on straight needles and join them into one large one.  As you can see I forgot to take into account that the cable would draw in the sides of its strip, making it narrower, and as a result looks like sort of a sloppy afterthought.  The flat piece, conversely, is too big, and I ended up with a really small neck-hole, so I folded some of the excess over & stitched it down into a pretty decent-looking shawl collar.  I'm not really happy with this for reasons I can't quite put my finger on.  It looks weird on, but I'm not sure if that's because I just don't really like the look of ponchos, or if I'm too small to pull off something this massive.  Or maybe it just looks so different from the original I can't really groove on it.

Anyways: Size 17 straight needles/Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick & Quick in Navy...Approx 6 skeins

"event","Ok, the first boa scarf went so fast I decided to make two.  Then I got some Fisherman's Wool to dye to match because I want to make matching felted bags for my sister's in law for Xmas.  (Based on this pattern: http://www.helloyarn.com/lopitote.htm )

Anyways, there was an ""adventure"" with the dying (of course!)  The green (lemon-lime) went fine, but according to the knitty.com article on Kool-Aid dying, Lemonade was supposed to produce a lightish neon yellow color.  When I poured my packets into the pot I realised it was just that cloudy white color I remembered it being from my childhood.  I put the wool in hoping ""maybe it will change?"" but of course it didn't.  I furiously rummaged through my cupboards until I found an ancient multipack of Flav-o-ade or some cheap generic knockoff.  There were two Strawberrys and a Cherry left (I was hoping for orange!) so I tossed them in and crossed my fingers.  Not sure if you can tell from the picture but the sort of citrus-y scarf does have some pink in it, so it all worked out in the end, I think.

(Sorry about the bewitching background of my utility room.)

These were made with about a third skein of Lion Brand Homespun and one skein of Bernat Boa.  They took MAYBE 4 hours, probably less, in straight garter stitch on size 13 needles.  A great beginner project.  (Hint - <lj user=""joeythegirl"">)"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Veronica's Sweater""><img src=""http://tinypic.com/accwy""></lj-cut>, which was my first ever major project, the one I was talking about MONTHS ago, I think.  I'd finished all but the trim, then did the trim in a whipstitch and hated it.  Ripped out the whipstitch and set it aside to be ignored.  I bought some purple FunFur for it and finally sat down to learn the crochet stitch to add it, and it looked horrible.  (I think it requires many, many rounds of crochet to look like actual fur.)  I dragged out the white yarn again and tried the crochet, hated it, ripped it out and FINALLY settled on the blanket stitch.  Steam pressed it flat and am pretty happy with it.  Not sure if it's too ""middle-aged lady"" for a 12 year-old girl though.  I think it'll be ok with jeans or something.  Hmm.

<lj-cut text=""Ava's Dress""><img src=""http://tinypic.com/accqc""></lj-cut> This is for my brother's little girl, who is 5.  It seems REALLY short, but it fits with all the measurements so it will hopefully fit.  After the first few rows I realised my gauge was WAY too large, so I started decreasing over a few rows, hoping it would look like an intentional ruffle when worn.  Eh, don't think so, lol.  I did a pretty good job of adjusting the pattern in my head as I went along though so everything came out right.  The stripe pattern was mine, and this was my first ""knit each side at the same time"" neckline, which was not too tough.

<lj-cut text=""Keyhole Scarf""><img src=""http://tinypic.com/accw4""></lj-cut>  For this I took the leftover purple from Ava's Dress and the Fun Fur from Veronica's sweater and ended up with this crazy thing.  There wasn't enough Fun Fur to make it full length, so I made a ""keyhole"" to pull the long end through to make a sort of wrap/cravat/dickie-looking thing to be worn under a coat.  I just bought a skein (on sale!) of Bernat Boa, which is similar to the Fun Fur in a tropical shade to use to make something similar with the leftover blue Homespun from Ava's dress.  Overall I'm pretty happy with my creative uses of leftovers, heh."

Note - Lion Brand Wool-Ease Thick & Quick is on sale at Michaels for $4.99.  That's the NORMAL price at Hancock Fabrics (which often has it on sale for - gasp! - $3.99) but Michaels has about twice as large a selection of colors.  I've been wanting Cranberry to make Bruce a sweater for ages and ages and the only place that has it it Michaels.

Other projects I'm working on:  

After trying to edge my neice's jacket with funfur and deciding it looked like ASS I read about someone using a strand of Homespun and a strand of FunFur to make a fluffy scarf.  Since the Fun Fur was purple and I had a half skein of Homespun leftover from my other neice's dress I gave it a try.  It actually looks really cute and ""Muppet-y"" and is going really quickly.  This will make a cute xmas gift for one of my girlfriends.  I was thinking I might make felted purses for them as well...we'll see.

I'm about halfway through a shawl/poncho for my mom, based ever-so-loosely on this design: http://www.helloyarn.com/onebaaadponcho.htm

The original requires a long circular needle, which I don't have (YET!) so I'm making two long scarves on straight needles, one with a cable, and will attach them lengthwise before attaching them poncho-style.  So the cable, rather than running through the middle, will be either up near the collar or along the bottom half, like trim.  Haven't decided yet.

I'm also working on a knit hat (Hot Head, from Stitch 'n' Bitch) for Adopt-a-sniper: http://www.adoptasniper.org/items.html

It's going SLOOOOWLY because it's ribbed, and I think I used too-small needles for it.  (I used a double-strand of Lion Brand Chunky USA because I couldn't find a decent sand/desert color in a thicker yarn - feh.)  I suspect when this is done it will be waaaay too small for a grown man-sized head, and scratchy to boot.  Hmmph.  My next will be better, I swear!"

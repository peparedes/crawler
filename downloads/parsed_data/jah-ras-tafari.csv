"event","I'm still floating from last night. Some good shit. So I was sitting here stoned and I forgot my hand was hurt so I popped my knuckles and it cracked really loudly and I looked at my knuckle and it was fine, so I guess it was just dislocated so bad that it displaced my knuckle. And you know what I'm gonna go smoke again.;-)"

"event","Well today was an interesting day. Woke up, worked school, weed, some more school, some more weed, and then my dogs got into a fight. I get them outside, still fighting, spray em with the hose, still fighting, try to rip them apart, can't, so i start punching them in the head, still fucking fighting, i finally get them apart. One runs away, the other one gets out my hand and chases it. About this time my neighbor jumps over the fence and kicks the aggressor in the chest. This makes the dog lose its grip, the dog runs away. We get them separated by a fence. It's about this time a notice my knuckle is destroyed, i mean fucked up. Looks like jello pudding that was placed under my skin in place of my knuckle too close to my pinkie, just sagging there."

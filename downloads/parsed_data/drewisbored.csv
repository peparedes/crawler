"event","Not to get into specifics, but I find it funny when someone (I'll say person A) gets frustrated with someone else (person B) because person A misses the way person b was prior to persuing power and becoming an angry power-hungry tyrant that sold his soul and sold out his friends in the name of a job. Fast-forward 4 monthes, person A, being the hypocritical piece of trash she has become, has taken it upon herself to do the same thing.

Hopefully, it will be worth it when I graduate in December, if I pass my classes, if I don't fuck up.

This summer class has robbed me of things, I wanted to do so much this summer, but I have done none of it. I guess budgeting does not always work when you are spending money on silly things.

"event","Hello, livejournal. I missed you, okay, so maybe it was more I forgot you. Anyhoo, I wanted to talk about the world cup, and soccer in general, and how flipping stupid it is.  I do not want to watch people chase around a ball for hours and get tossed out if they come into contact with someone.  I do not want to see these folks flailing on the ground, carted off in a strectcher, and then returning 5 minutes later as though nothing happened. All this to draw a penalty. And these dumb-ass soccer refs buy it. What a joke. And spare me this argument about the ""theatrics of soccer."" If I wanted to see some pansy fake injury for the sake of theater, I would see a Shakespare play, not watch soccer. Also, I do not want to hear about how the rest of the world loves soccer and the U.S.A. is the only country where soccer has not caught on. Soccer has not caught on because most Americans don't buy this fake injury bull-shit.  We also have more to do, and more money to do it with. I do not think that there are many folks in Niger who can afford to play American football. Soccer is the only option. We, in the USA, have more options that most of the world does not.

You may be asking yourself, what is the purpose of this entry. It is just an entry into this journal that I rarely update that reflects what I have been thinking about. At this time, it is soccer. Come back later, maybe I will talk about something more relevant than soccer."

Only two more semesters of school at USI, and then it is off to Nashville.  Nashville, Tennessee is where I want to go afte college.  I went down there yesterday (New Year's Eve) and I just love the city more every time I go down there. Myself and a few of us from Target are planning on going to a Preds game in February. Oh, if you are reading this, you can come too if you want to go see a Preds hockey game.  We are having a party at Joe's house Tuesday. Hooray.  I have started hanging out with folks ar Target more often recently.  Seems (with the exception of Jimmy who I do not hang out with much) my Henderson friends are a bunch of apathetic lame-asses.  I am not going tosay my new friends are cooler than my old friends, because they are all my friends, but, people in Evansville seem more interested in socializing and doing things. We had a Halo party last month, and now this, I guess going back to Target wasn't so bad. Thank you Arby's for not taking me back.  Substitute teaching is an adventure, that pays well.  I really enjoy the teaching element of it. I have given serious thought into taking some education classes and perhaps attempting to become a teacher post-college.  My dad is coming to town this week. I hate Henderson, I do not understand why anyone would volunteeraly choose to live here, never have, never will."

This is why, despite repated attempts, I just can not bring myself to support the St. Louis Cardinals.  Your team f***ing lost!! GET OVER IT!! Ever since the Cards were bounced, I have had to listen to these whiny Cardinal fans drone on and on and on about terrible umpiring. Christ, that was a month ago, get over it! It is just a f***ing game.  I guess I just do not understand why so many Cardinals fans are so whiny (now, that is not a blanket statement accusing all CArds fans of being whiny a-holes, my girlfriend is a Cards fan, so is everyone in her family, I do not uniformally hate Cards fans, some of them are the best baseball fans I know).  I just do not understand why the fans in St. Louis are ALWAYS whining about something.  When I went to see the Reds-Cards game last year in Cincy, the Cards fans in my section were whining the whole game, and after the Reds lit them up for 8 runs in the 7th inning to take an 8-3 lead, they left, grumbling about how the Reds got lucky.  Um, last time I checked it takes more than luck to score 8 runs in an inning. So to all the whiny (not all cards fans, just the whiny ones)cards fans out there and idiot state legislators, a big giant f*** you for USI.

"event","Well, got back from Cincy last night, had a blast.  We went to Newport on the Levee, which, I will honest, was not as fun as I thought, but cool none-the-less.  There was a band called Longfellow playing there, I listened to it for a little bit, then we walked across the Purple People Bridge that connects pedestrains traffic between Cincy and Newport, KY.  We wanted to go to the Aquarium, but squandered too much time during the day to get there in time. We also wanted to go to the comedy club that is at the levee, but forgot. We went to Tower place mall in downtown Cincinnati for a little while, but could not go to the top of Carew Tower, I guess we were to late for that too.  WE walked around downtown for a while before heading out to the suburbs in search of a Target.  We ended up in Mason, Ohio, which is a quaint, pleasant suburb about 20 miles outside of Downtown Cincinnati.  We found a Target, and ate at Fudruckers, which was dissapointing to say the least. 

Then, the main event. Sunday we went to Paul Brown Stadium to see the Bengals battle the Houston Texans.  First of all, Paul Brown Stadium is easily the best stadium I have ever been too.  The concourses were wide, the bathrooms clean, and there were concession stands everywhere with fast lines.  There are even Bengal helmet designs on the back of each chair. 

After doing some last minute walking and waiting for the traffic to clear up a little bit, we left Cincy. I can wait wait to go back up there, I rather enjoy Cincinnati and hope to move there after college.

In other news unrelated to that, I had orientation this morning at Arby's and will be going in for a shift at 11.  October 12 is my final day at Target, and can not come soon enough.  What a miserable place Target is."

"event","Well, I am trying to do my homework in the Orr center, but instead, I am just planning my trip to Cincinnati in a couple of weeks.  I am going to see the Cincinnati Bengals dismantle the Houston Texans on October 2! I am very excited about this.  Lisa and I will be sitting in the lower level behind one of the endzones!! I can not wait. Also, on October 16, the Bengals are playing the Titans in Nashville.  We have discussed taking a big group down to watch this. I want to wear my Rudi Johnson(#32 owns all, by the way) jersey and start a fight with some titans fans. I am not sure if that is in the budget though, I really want to go see Weezer and the Foo Fighters, and, I also am getting ready to move out. When I say getting ready, I mean scouring for places and prepping financially. The goal is to be moved out before my 23rd birthday for a couple of reasons:

1) I do not like where I am at now.
2) I plan to graduate in December of next year, and then moving to (unnamed location that is 90% allready picked), I do not want to be stuck in a lease until the March after I graduate, I wanna move away ASAP!
3) Did I mention how much I hate living at home?

I got my brakes fixed yesterday, now my car stops without making loud noises and feeling like it is sliding.  

I also want to go play frisbee golf. There is a course at USI, it sounds fun.  Anyone care to join me sometime, I will have to go check out the special frisbees from the rec center, and we have to play during the day, unless you want to bring some flashlights for night playing."

Unfortunatly, it is thursday, and still no word from the New Orleans bretheren.

Anyhoo, I do not think I have ever been so worried about anyone before like this in my life. It is pretty scary. It is one thing to sit back and feel bad for the people of New Orleans and Mississippi, but it is a whole other story when you have people who are like family to you that live there and you do not know what they are doing or where they even are.  If, no, when I hear from them, I will certainly feel a whole lot better."

But enough about that. I just, miss my family.  I mean, for the most part, I do not really hang out with a lot of the same people I used too, and the people I do hang out with, want to move away too.  What reason is there for me to stay here when I finish college? None that I can think of.  I have spent the past few days thinking about that, and I have come up with nothing. My mom plans on moving to Findlay, Ohio next summer, so there goes the only real reason I would have had to stay here.  I hate USI. I hate Evansville. I hate Target. I hate Henderson. I hate the humidity. I hate the string of 90 degree temperateres (it was 77 degrees in Detroit yesterday).  I hate the pathetic news stations around here (except for News 25!) I hate the shitty newspaper that doesnt even bother to come on mondays.  I could continue, but what is the point of that.  I am just feeling rather depressed about my situation.  I hate this place I am at. I wish USI either didn't suck or was more expensive. If USI did not suck, I could at least enjoy being so far from my family.

Well, easy may not be the word, Calculus probably will not be easy, lets just say taking fewer than 15 hours will be a welcome change.  I only have three more semesters left before I graduate, then, perhaps it is off to graduate school for a master's, or, becoming a manager at Target. You realize that as an STL (store team leader) at Target you can make $84,000 a year? I certainly did not, I am glad I am getting involved in Target's management trainging program. I am gonna be rich (3 years after I graduate at least). You have to have a degree though, a four year degree, which I will have soon. Then, I will have money, something I have not had much of in a long time.

Also, this is my last day off before heading up to Michigan next Thursday.  We are renting a car. We are taking my dad to a Detroit Tigers game, a surprise Detroit Tigers game. He won't know until we get there. Literally.  We told him we were going to Pontiac to celebrate Lisa's birthday, but once we get into Detroit, we are going to tell him we are going to stop at the Hard Rock Cafe to get a T-shirt. We might actually do that. Anyway, after that or instead of, we are heading to Comerica Park on Friday night August 5th to see the Tigers take on the Cleveland Indians.  It will be fun.
We are also going to go to Grand Rapids, just to see what it is like. And before you ask, no, I am not going to Canada. Folks at TArget always ask my that. NO! I am most definitly not going to Canada, crossing the border is not worth the hassle just to hit up Windsor. We will, however, hit up Greektown one night, and perhaps head on over to Ann Arbor. So, if this is in fact my final update before going to Michigan next week, I wish you all well, and I will see you when I return."

When some Evansville fool whines about having driven all the way to target only to find that we were out of stock, I say ""I am sorry, where did you come from?"" 80 percent of the time I ask that is within 5 miles of the store! WTF!! In Monroe, people thought nothing of driving half an hour to another store, but people here bitch about it as though Evansville is some type of metropolis and driving 15 minutes to the other Target is a big deal! IT IS NOT! WHY DON'T YOU FUCKING WHINY ASS EVANSVILLE BITCHES SPEND SOME TIME IN A REAL CITY AND SEE WHAT PAIN IN THE ASS TRAFFIC IS ALL ABOUT!! 

Ok, so I could continue ripping on the shit-hole that is Evansville, but I will stop for now. I did not plan on that rant, but good gravy sakes alive!! FUCK YOU EVANSVILLE!"

"event","An actual infportant update. Wow! I interviewed for a promotion at Target today, and will be interveiwing for a TPS (Target Protection Specialist, or a security guy in non-target terms) tommorow night. I also talked to my store manager Jim Hook about becoming an executive at Target after I finish my degree. I may soon be training to be able to take Target over after college. I also won $150 Tuesday night at Casino Aztar. That was great. Also went to St. louis this past weekend to take in a Cards game. They won on the bottom of the 9th on an RBI single by Abraham Nunez ( i think that is who hit it).  We then went to St. Louis Union Station. Pretty cool."

Indianapolis seems to be the front runner for reasons I will not go into right now, but if Lisa and I part ways, Cleveland, Detroit, Arizona, and Las Vegas become more serious contenders.

I also convinced Jacob it would be ok to see Batman Begins at the IMAX, so we saw it yesterday. It was awesome.  During the action scenes it was great to see it on the IMAX, but it was nothing special during non-action scenes. The action scenes certainly made it worth it. The only complaint I had about my visit was, well, I have two complaints.  First of all, the girl at the concession stand was sooooooo sloooooow and kept messing up orders.  It was getting on my nerves. Then some old guy tried to cut in front of me, needless to say I took care of that.  My second complaint, and maybe it is just me, I guess I just remember IMAX screens being bigger. Maybe I have distorted memories, maybe Evansville just has a cheap IMAX screen. I just remember the ones in Detroit and Indianapolis being bigger. Oh well."

We drove it Around the checklanes, and we squealed the tires.  Pretty sweet, thing can go quite fast. So I said, almost jokingly, I wonder how fast I could do a lap around Target. Ray's reply: ""Ok, I will come back at 3 when you get off, take as many laps as you want,"" or something to that effect.  Anyway, he forgot, but yesterday said that if I come in during his normal evening time after I get off work, I could take a lap or two or three.  Well, I came in to see RAy and drive his scooter. I must say, it was a blast. After completing a lap around Target, I went joyriding through the parking lot for about 10 minutes. I was weaving in and out of parked cars and topping at least 20-30mph on the thing. What a great experience that was. Now I have something to look forward to when I get old, joyriding on an old person scooter. It was great."

Your mind is good at deep mental analysis and complicated reasoning. 

You are very psychic and sensitive, and you should usually follow your hunches.

Ok, here is the deal. I have been accumulating all of my spare change and keeping it in a cup since Christmas. So, here is the deal, you have to guess how much change I have in my cup.  Whoever gets the CLOSEST WITHOUT GOING OVER will recieve a prize. Seriously.  In the spirit of competition, the is a required minimum numbers of entires, meaning, if only two people guess, than it does not count, and the contest is cancelled.  This way, I can see how many people actually visit this thing, or even care to comment.  So, make you guess in a reply and good luck.  Contest will close in a few days. To give you some idea, the cup is a large Taco Bell cup, and is filled about 1/3 full.  

Rules summed up:
1) If a minimum of entries do not guess, the contest is cancelled. That number is pre-determined but not released to contestants.

2) If your guess is over the actual total of change in my cup, you lose. This is a CLOSEST WITHOUT GOING OVER contest.

3) The prize will be rewarded depending on who wins and what they want. Perhaps a burned CD, some prize huh?

4) Any references to Al Mason during this contest will lead to an automatic disqualification."

I am wanting off the sales floor and out of the back room. Only bad part, I have to wear an apron. But, I do get to take it home with me, my own apron. Woot Woot!

In other realms of life, I am planning a trip to cincinnati and louisville to see how liveable they are. I have been to both places, but, this gives me an excuse to go.  Eric has agreed to tag along on one journey to take in a Cincinnati Reds game or a Louisville Bats game.  As silly as it may seem to some of you for me to go and scope out these cities, but I think I need o have some type of plan.  I think the reason I am having to stay in school so long right now is because I never had a clear plan of what I should be doing, or what I should pursue. I am trying to formulate a post-college plan, so I can get my feet on the ground and get a job when I finish school. If nothing else, I can decide where to look for jobs after college, which, also would include Evansville. After looking over some data, there is no way I can get a decent job in Henderson that will pay good, which is fine, I loathe Henderson.  After giving it careful thought, and reviewing some info I compiled on Indianapolis, is not the place I thought it was, which is fine, it is more India-crap-olis than I ever imagined.  I apologize for the confusion.

"event","well, yesterday was v-day. I do not know many males who truly enjoy this holiday. single guys i know(i am mostly refering the folks at target i intersact with) feel lonely and anti v-day because it makes them feel bad. The non-single guys (myself and a couple of others) are not big fans of the holiday wither. We are forced to plop down money on candy and a card AND we have to pay for dinner. I guess the only plus was that it was warm so Lisa wore this short skirt that I like as ""my reward"" for taking her out. Yeah, actully i guess there are some perks...

ANYWAY, i think i might transfer to NKU. Lisa might come with me. So might a couple folks from Target."

"event","I really love my job, but we are closed Monday yay and I have Tuesday off, 4 whole days off. I worked 48 hours this week between Damariscotta and Belfast, so I am looking to 4 days off, time to catch up on housework and college class work. My house is going to be sparkling by the time I go back to work on Wednesday of next week. The kids are so funny, one of them said last week, ""My dad has a tape of Irish drinking songs and we really like it."" Yeah they're a laugh a minute. Well gotta run, gotta go to work, bye."

"event","That's how often I update my journal. I went to Walmart with Sally today. I bought the new Tracy Chapman CD with the song Change on it which I love. If you knew that you would die today and see the face of God and love would you change, etc. sung to a very catchy tune. Anyway, my college class was canceled for lack of students. How great is that, I have 2,000 free friggin dollars this year to pay for classes and no classes to go to. Damnit I can't stay poor for the rest of my life just to get free college tuition. This sucks. Oh well as I'm reminded on a daily basis I have it alot better than the people in New Orleans. By the way while we are on the subject, me and the free air out there in cyberspace, somebody out to hang Ray Nagin up by his feet and leave him hanging, he's truly an idiot. First he neglects to evacuate people with the many means he has at his disposal, and as Megan would say, and he does (have means at his disposal), then he gets on the air whining and complaining about the federal govt. not jumping right on down there. Now that the feds are there he's on the news whining about the sound of too many helicopters in the air, give me a break, he has to be a damn Democrat. That's their MO, bitch when you don't do something, then bitch when you do, they sure have the right campaign symbol, the jackass, hee haw.I say hang him upside down for awhile, maybe some of the brains in his ass will run into his head, nope guess not, that's just crap down there, he's already full of it from his head to his toes."

I've got some old apples and I'm going to make apple crisp, yummy, I'll put some of my oat fiber in with the rolled oats and make it healthier, and use less sugar, maybe maple syrup instead of sugar. I bought myself The Passion and a Third Day cd with one of my very favorite songs on it, Love Song. One of the grandmothers of the kids in the program gave me 3 bags of free clothes. I picked them over and wow,found 2 brand new dresses with the tags still on and matching jackets that went with them. I wore one of them to church today and got complimented. I would have even bought these clothes if I had seen them on a rack, how lucky am I. They are bohemian hippie chic, just my style. Made in India, too. Yup those Buddhists sure know how to sew in those sweatshops. Good clothes for us rich Americans, whoops I'm not rich. Oh well it's off to work I go, but not until Tuesday this week since Monday is a paid holiday, yay for paid holidays. Well I guess I'll just have to go make some black bean hummus and garlic herb feta cheese. See you all later with another exciting update on my life,as I know it."

"event","It is a beautiful day outside, it was perfect weather for walking this morning, slightly cool, but still warm enough not to have to wear a coat. I stopped at the farm stand and bought zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, parm cheese, fresh basil and some nectarines. I grilled the zucchini after I sliced it into circles and brushed it with extra virgin olive oil, garlic and chopped fresh basil. It was yummy on a whole grain tortilla with grilled chicken, peppers, onions,mushrooms and cheese. I heard
 someone say mom when I was outside and looked, but of course even though it sounded like my daughter I knew it wasn't. They have returned to Virginia and I must say I do miss them and I miss the swimming pool on a day like today. I love to swim and Sundays in Virginia were fun because we would usually swim and have a barbeque. Oh well there's always next summer. Time does fly when you're having fun and I guess I had alot of fun over the past 5 weeks cause it flew by like a jet plane on rocket fuel."

"event","A fresh new snowfall, looks quite pretty, but this time of year has me longing for spring and even though we haven't had that much snow winter seems to be dragging along. I dug a book out to read, it seems that everything on t.v. is quite boring and all the same. I had an idea for a mystery book today, but where to start. I have never written a book before, although I have made up a couple of spooky children's stories that the kids where I work absolutely adore. I know they would sell if I could afford to put them in book form, because the target market loves them and begs me to tell these stories again and again. I read an article last week about a man who wrote a children's book but was constantly turned down by publishers he submitted it to, so he went ahead and published it himself and it sold 118,000 copies which made him quite wealthy. Well I guess I will never know if I don't get off my can and make it happen. Oh to be debt free and have a nice bank balance. That would be quite lovely."

"event","December 20th my dad passed away. It all seemed a blur at the time. You go through all the necessary motions applicable for the moment, details that later you might forget and details you forgot at the moment, because no matter what you try to sort out, you will forget, which relative have you failed to inform, the most important and closest ones you call first and try to remember the ones you haven't seen or talked to in months. Details slip by as you occupy yourself with them. Then later when your mind is allowed to wander on its own course you try to grasp the reality of the loss. Your mind can't quite wrap itself around the fact that someone you have known and loved your whole life is no longer in this world. As hard as you try to comprehend it you just can't seem to get a grasp on it. Practically you know it's true, but in the depths it keeps washing over you like an unrelenting ocean of sadness. Not all the time, just at the moments you try to grasp it. I guess most people refer to that as grief, because inside your spirit is grieved. I cannot begin to comprehend my mother's grief, married to daddy for 56 years, having had 4 children together, I know that it is overwhelming for her, not all the time, but more so than for me because she is confronted with it more. It makes me sad for her."

"event","nothing like sitting in front of a giant screen with surround sound and watching violence and other things. I went to 2 movies this week Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Johnny Depp is hot as is Antonio Banderas, but even they couldn't rescue this movie( sounds like a critic) well glad it was bargain night, then I went to see Under the Tuscan Sun which was o.k.. When I got up I noticed the entire audience consisted of old people,scary. But today Dragonfly was on encore on the boob tube and it was a pretty darn good movie, had enough action to keep it interesting, so if you get a chance to watch it you probably will like it, especially if you liked The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes, or otherworldly type movies. That is my movie review. Have a nice weekend and remember it's nice to escape once in awhile."

"event","I went to the lumber yard today to see about getting some plastic for my greenhouse. I pulled into the parking lot grooving to Tori Amos. The door was wide open to the store and I could smell the testosterone. A manly man poked his head out of the door as if to say female invading male territory. I waltzed on in and the manly man waiting on me of course had to make a joke, but when he quoted the price of 100 feet I said to myself, I may be of the female persuasion, but I ain't that dumb, and out loud told him I would check the price at Home Depot. It turned out to be $31.00 cheaper at the Home Depot, glad I waited and bought it there instead. Lovely weekend we are having, isn't it?"

I finished our fall developmental continuums on the kids enrolled in our program, no small feat, 50 questions each for 17 children. The sense of accomplishment is overwhelming, plus I have one hell of a headache. I think I need my back cracked. Calgon take me away, far far away, to a sunny beach. Oh well, the only alternative is home, my 2 mile afternoon walk and getting a jump on my housework so I won't have to spend all weekend doing it. Adios amigos, have a nice weekend."

"event","my favorite time of the year is here, fall,and even though I know winter is coming I can't help but love these fall days, 70 degrees, fresh crisp morning air. I went for my 2 mile walk today and a squirrel was scampering up the road ahead of me probably busy storing winter's bounty which reminds me I need to check my own garden and pick green peppers and tomatoes. Tortilla soup for supper tonight, yum yum,healthy and delicious. I have to hit the health food store this afternoon for almond butter, honey and brown rice syrup. Laundry is drying on the line and will smell quite wonderful when I fold it up later today. I miss my mudgie and Erica. The little tot down the street, Malena, and I'm sure I did not spell her name right, was out walking with her grammy today, her little ponytail swinging pushing a baby stroller with a doll in it, how cute. Makes me miss my girls, I can't wait to see them in November. Hope everyone is enjoying these wonderful days."

"event","The end of summer is quickly arriving. Tonight I went out and picked tomatoes from my garden, sometimes I wish summer could go on forever, what's better than going outside when you want a cucumber or tomato and picking it from the vine, much better than going to a grocery store and cheaper too. As I bent down to pick the tomatoes I could smell the sweetness of the earth and the vine. I inhaled the fragrance of the summer evening, just being and enjoying the moment.The chill in the air was starting to settle as the sun was sinking below the horizon and I know fall is not far behind, nipping at the heels of summer, ready to begin its own cycle of changing leaves and ripening apples as the smoke from the chimneys of wood fires already burning wind their way up towards the sky. Summer is nearly gone, but one consolation is that it will come again and there will be more tomatoes to grow and more moments to enjoy their sweet fragrance."

"event","Workshop today,getting ready for a new school year. I am excited about a new school year but I am more excited about the prospect of going to Virginia for Thanksgiving and Christmas. My husband hates to go very long without seeing 2 of his favorite girls, of course he sees me every day. That's one of the things I love about him, the fact that he loves his family and I know he would die for them or kill for them, if he had to to protect them. Yes I am feeling like a fortunate woman, I have been married for almost 30 years and when I look at my husband my heart beats faster. have there been times I wanted to strangle him, absolutely, divorce him, sometimes. But it's all worth it in the long run to hang in there. Because what started out as attraction has turned into deep abiding love. I was listening to a song by Gary Chapman last night and the words go, with God adding it all up He does something that only God can do He makes one of two. That's Fred and me, we are one. i will never forget the first time he said I love you. We were at the litlle grocery store in Cherryfield, Maine. We were shopping for necessary canned goods (living in a camp in the woods). He was standing in the canned bean aisle with his denim jacket on and a leather beanie hat with stars on it and he looked at me and said I love you.  Silly and trite to everyone but me. Such is life."

I could not sleep early this morning so I resorted to the boob tube as I washed 2 loads of laundry, hoping the washer wouldn't take off through the roof on the spin cycle, I think I need to jam a piece of wood underneath it to balance it out.Anyway I watched a sort of documentary film on robert crumb, what I used to find quite humorous during druggie days I don't find quite so funny anymore, but I must say the man is an extremely talented artist. He has quite an obsession with T&A, overall sexually obsessed and some of it is pretty gross. Which brings me to my last and final post for today,how do women with implants get mammograms, I intend to ask the lab technologist the next time I have one, just weird curiosity, guess I've been watching too much robert crumb."

"event","time moves on and so do we all. my daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter were here visiting this week from virginia. I came upstairs after they left and pressed meggie's sleeping blanket to my face so that I could inhale her fragrance, looked at the empty beds and felt sadness washing over me as the ocean tide had done only 2 days before. Sometimes I miss them so much, but I know they are where they are supposed to be. Yesterday my sister got married, she has been a widow for 5 years (having previously been  married for 30 years to her deceased husband,Chuck). I am glad she has moved on. Today when I came upstairs I saw a picture of Chuck on the bureau. Even in my happiness for my sister, there is melancholy sadness for what our family misses, his presence within our family.Time moves on and so do we."

"event","isn't it rather odd that people who are prochoice are anti war. So it's o.k. to kill another human as long as they are in the womb, but it's not o.k. to kill another person if they are born. where does that leave pro choice when it comes to the partially born nee partial birth abortion. somehow this just does not jive. I personally am pro life, am against crazy people who blow up abortion clinics because it is not up to them to make someone pay. I am against war, but I do believe in fighting when there is a just cause such as freeing people from tyranny, such as the civil war, world war II, and sadly the iraqui war, as one man said, and I paraphrase, as I am not sure of the exact wording, evil prospers when good men stand back and do nothing, but sometimes I think as long as it does not touch us we do not care and we turn our heads away."

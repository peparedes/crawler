I went off on Erin, sorry dude, but I was getting fucked with all day long and I went off. Anyway you need to chill out, you took it all to seriously. I was joking most way through it. I disagree with Bush less than Kerry, but I know Bush is fucked, I've told you that before dude. Most of what I said was a joke, but I did get irritated that you were painting Kerry as a fucking saint, the man is as radical and fucked as Bush, he just hasn't been in the public eye long enough for people to recognize it. He is from Mass, and how fucked is this state?

On a lighter note, I made some icons yesterday, I'll post 'em when I get home. If anyone has a word only icons they want made, ask me and I'll do it for ya.

I bought a new cd Tearing Down Your Blue Skies by Diecast. Fucking awesome cd.

I'm out for now.

Next update will be friends only, so be nice to me."

"event","Got a whole lotta needless bullshit on my mind... But... Umm, here is a song I wrote called ""Late October""
::Note:: The caps denote screaming smart ones

I HATE THE WAY YOU MADE ME FEEL
LIKE I WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL
Now I know I'm nothing new
I HATE THE TRUTHS YOU TOLD ME
And the lies that I found out
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT YOU?

THE URGES IN MY SKIN PULSING ME TO HARM MYSELF OR YOU
The urges in my skin pulsing me to just reject you
THE FEELINGS FROM MY THROAT BIND UP AND CHOKE OUT ALL CARE
The feelings from my throat tell me that you were never there
FOR ME

SOMETHING IN MY BONES TELLS ME
THAT YOU KNEW THAT SOMEDAY I WOULD KNOW
ALL THESE THINGS YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT
BUT I GUESSED BY THE WAY YOU FLINCHED
THAT YOU KNEW MY REACTION WAS GOING TO BE HARSH
Somehow I don't think that you knew I was throwing you away
Deep down in the dirt they'll find clawing your way out
But you'll never get out, they will find you
Dead... Dead... DEAD!

THE URGES IN MY SKIN PULSING ME TO HARM MYSELF OR YOU
The urges in my skin pulsing me to just reject you
THE FEELINGS FROM MY THROAT BIND UP AND CHOKE OUT ALL CARE
The feelings from my throat tell me that you were never there
FOR YOURSELF

SOMETHING IN MY CHEST NOTIFIES ME
THAT I AM NOT ALRIGHT
WHAT A SURPRISE THIS WAS TO ME
WHAT A GODDAMN SURPRISE
I'M AFRAID THAT WITH YOU GONE
I'LL ACTUALLY BE HAPPY AGAIN
SOMETHING IN MY STOMACH TELLS ME
THIS PAIN OR CARE WILL NEVER GO AWAY AGAIN
And I blame you for the fact that I can't
Stem this bleeding anymore, it's just gotten worse
My arm spells on your name on the floor
Followed by the words ""NO MORE""

THE URGES IN MY SKIN PULSING ME TO HARM MYSELF OR YOU
The urges in my skin pulsing me to just reject you
THE FEELINGS FROM MY THROAT BIND UP AND CHOKE OUT ALL CARE
The feelings from my throat tell me that you were never there
FOR ANYONE AT ALL!

And here is another called ""Silence"" which isn't quite done but I'm working.

Somewhere, on this plain of existence I creep
Too loud to every be heard, too quiet! TOO QUIET!
SOMEHOW I KNOW THIS REPORT OF YOU WILL BE
FALSIFIED MY SOME WHO KNOW TO MUCH TO BE
YOUR-TRUE-SELF-DESTROYED-NEVER FOUND AMONG THE DEAD
Why did the world turn quiet?
Why did my heart beat again for you?
Somehow I know, this was right
ISN'T THIS RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

The world was quiet as the sky fell down
And you knew it didn't you?
I guessed as much, your answer was silence

Look at a picture at my younger self
Look at how all of these years passed me by
WITHOUT ANYTHING TANGIBLE OR WORTHWHILE
IS WORTHWHILE always tangible
I want something I can hold, but can I hold these
FEELINGS ARE DESTROYING ME INSIDE OUT
YOU ARE ALL TO BLAME I BLAME YOU!

The world was quiet as the sky fell down
And you knew it didn't you?
I guessed as much, your answer was silence

Somewhere, on this plain of existence I crawl
Steadily to you, crawling too you
YOU WERE FURTHER AWAY THAN I COULD HAVE IMAGINED


And no I won't explain either at all nor will I explain what I meant by ""changes"" in an earlier journal entry. SO DEAL WITH IT!

I WANT SO BADLY TO KILL JAKOB!!! I AM SO FUCKING PISSED AND I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYONE!! FUCK THIS BULLSHIT!!! KRISTEN IS GOING TO DIE TOO!!!! FUCK THIS ASSHOLE BULLSHIT!!!!

Done... I hope I never see you around again.

Song, MY SONG!

well, it's not fair, it's not even close.
you tied me down,
where i'm forced to watch as you poke holes in every part of me
containing something secretly.
something sacred to me.
i lied my face off when i said that i would be okay,
it's never fine when you go away.
these cuts run deep, these scars are permanent, and always on display.
this makes things difficult for me.

it's not fair, it's not even close.
you fed me the sun,
burned me up inside and watched me choke on everything we did.
on everything we lived.
let's see if i can live again.
i lied my face off when i said that i would be okay,
it's never fine when you go away.
these cuts run deep, these scars are permanent, and always on display.
this makes things difficult for me.

head like an empty, sterile room.
somehow i made a mess.
like watching newborn babies crack from work-related stress.

I saw my friend Jeff while trick or treating (yes i did that, and what) and looks at me and goes ""Let me guess, a disgruntled teen?""

a simple sound a heavy sigh
you'll win the whole world over
you'll live in fear of being someone that you didn't want to
i realize your insecurities will get the best of you

"event","""What the fuck am I running from?""

There is so much shit going on. Too much of it to post here actually...

Alot of it involves a person or people (I'll let you guess) that mean a very lot to me. There are alot of decisions I have made and will make that will shape the way I am and the way you all (meaning Brandon, cuz as we all know he is the only one who reads this) see me. The only thing I really hope for is that no one hates me for this, although I honestly don't see why anyone would... But with the way this group runs, who the fuck knows... Although, I do have ""ammo"" just in case any of this shit does go south.

I hung out with Kat a bit today, she got kind of pissed at me... She still seems to think I called her a whore I FUCKING DIDN'T WILL SOMEONE PLEASE FUCKING TELL HER THAT GODDAMNIT!!!!!!  <~EXTRA FUCKING EXCLAMATION POINTS WOOT FUCKER!

Umm... I'm talking to ...people? Erika is here, hanging out with her is always so much fun!

SONG YOU BITCHES! GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO HALLOWEEN!

Take everything left from me. (All to blame)
How can we still succeed, taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed.
Supersize our tragedy!
Bought in the land of the free!
(The free!)

And we're all too blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are,
We want it all with no sacrifice!

Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear.
Stand to salute; say thanks to the man of the year.
How did we all come to this?
It's greed that we just can't resist!
(Resist!)

And we're all too blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are,
We want it all.
Everyone wants it all with no sacrifice!

Tell me now, what have we done? We don't know.
I can't allow what is being done to tear it down,
Believe me now, we don't know just what
With our backs against the wall.

And now we're all too blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true
I do believe,
Don't we all?
Everyone, everyone,
We will fall.

'Cause we're all to blame
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We want it all,
Everyone, don't we all?"

Yesterday I went to my allergist appointment where they stuck a shitload of needles in me and now I'm sore as all fuck and feel like shit too.

I talked to Meagan last night and she said she'd try to hook me up with who she thinks the girl I like is lol. I never actually pointed her out to anyone except Sam, but hey, this is Sam we are talking about people, would she likely remember? lol

Umm... I'm out. ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTIONS!!!!

So I'm looking at this bottle, and this bottle, it speaks to me.
It says get off the fucking train, so I jumped down.
These metaphors are for assholes, and I'm not different. I'll get to what I mean, but slowly.
Roses and poetry; that's all you want to be?
It's not alive, and not dead. It's looking for a reason to be.
Not alive, and not dead. You give me goals impossible and I get further from my own.
If these were lies then I wouldn't be leaving. You had to need me.
I tried this once before. It's just as insulting. What for?
It's not alive, and not dead. Looking for a reason to be?
Can we find a balance, a medium?
My anger was a heavy weight you bore. Now I'm balancing meteors. I want to see you.

But not alive, and not dead. Show me what you used to be.
I was looking at this bottle and the words made sense to me, because it was all a fucking dream.
A lie.
I'm not alive, and I'm not dead.
I just see my goals are impossible and I get further from them all.
These mocking words. We buried both.
What a world without you holds, I had to know"

Catch me. I'm a wreck who let my conscience down.
I bet the animals sleep well after they hunt.

Someone open up a fucking window.
Something just fucking died in here.
It's been breathing fucking heavy for a long fucking time now
and it's lost its fucking will to survive.
Oh no!
And what's so sick, so wrong that you don't want to believe
that such a massacre is capable of coming from me?
You're gonna lose your lunch. It's gonna blow your mind.
But hold it down. Hold it down.
Catch me if you can but don't fall for what you've found.
I bet the animals don't think of what they've done.
Flip the fucking lever on the light switch.
Turn that fucking fan all the way up.
I'm gonna get first fucking place for the worst fucking attitude and I don't give a fuck at all.
Oh no!!
I don't feel so old. I'm smiling again.
If you don't feel sorrow, then I've already failed.
I don't feel so old. Warm blood's pumping in.
You don't feel sorrow, but I'm already there, 'cos tonight I've taken nothing but insults.
Tonight I'm gonna go for the middle.
Tonight I've taken all of the insults.
Tonight I'm gonna fire them back...
You ignore my resolve while my conscience clings to life.
But I stomped the heart out of it, hoping that it dies"

Not like it matters much... I wrote this so I could post this song...

Nevermind that song... here's another.

please don't ask me how
I ended up at my wits end and beaking down
pages torn from books we never read
because we're plugged into this grid
don't pull this plug right now or then we'dreally have to live

when i die will they remember not what i did but what i haven't done?
it's not the end that i fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to death

when we build these dreams on sand
how they all slip through our hands
this might be our only chance 

let's take this one day at a time
i'll hold your hand if you hold mine
the time that we kill keeps us alive

your words won't save me now
i'm at the edge feeling the sweat drop from my brow
get a grip on yourself is what they say
every hour every day
hands over my ears, i've been screaming all these years

when i die will they remember not what i did but what i haven't done?
it's not the end i fear with each breath, it's life that scares me to death

when we build these dreams on sand
how they all slip through our hands
this might be our only chance 

let's take this one day at a time
i'll hold your hand if you hold mine
the time that we kill keeps us alive

we came in search of answers 
we left empty handed again
shots fired into the sky are now returning 
where the fuck will you hide?

hiding from the laughter in the closet of our lives
but the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light
and now a hand's extending outward, quiet comfort they invite
do we dare take what they offer, do we step into the light?"

Umm, other than I am lonely. So umm... later.

My, my what a mess we've made of our pretty little heads these days.
It appears a heavy wind's blown through here recently.
Best wishes have been made for you, you never had no say it's true.
You have to be the cutest gravedigger I've ever seen.
And all your lonely nights in the city of lights are much like 
all these crowded bars I so often find my stupid self stumbling through.

My, my what a mess was made of my head 
when I heard what you'd been through that day
It appears a violent storm's passed through you recently.
Letters meant to be sent have been torn.
The phone lies off the hook, on the floor.
All these ""I'm sorry""s and ""I miss you""s are useless,
I fucked this one up long ago.
And all your lonely nights in the city of lights are much like 
all these crowded bars I so often find my stupid self stumbling through.

Fuck you Aurora,
You took my only friend.
And although it's all my fault,
the blaming myself had to come to an end

Fuck you Aurora,
You took my only friend.
You wont catch me behind the wheel of a Chrysler ever again.

It appears a big fucking tornado has twisted us up recently. 
Best wishes have been made for you, you never had no say it's true.
You have to be the cutest gravedigger I've ever seen.
And all your lonely nights in the city of lights are much like 
all these crowded bars I so often find my stupid self stumbling through.

Fuck you Aurora,
You took my only friend.
And although it's all my fault,
the blaming myself had to come to an end
so I say:
Fuck you Aurora,
You took my only friend.
You won't catch me behind the wheel of a Chrysler ever again"

That is a line from my new favorite movie: Bad(der) Santa
Holy shit that movie is fucking hilarious. ""I beat the shit out of some kids today, but it was for a purpose. It made me feel good about myself.""

""Where is your sleigh?""
""In the shop.""
""Where are the reindeer?""
""I stabled them.""
""Where?""
""Next to the shop.""
""How do they sleep?""
""Standing up""
""No, how do they sleep with the noise?""
""What noise?""
""From the shop.""
""They only work during the day.""
""But I thought it was always night at the north pole.""
""No, now its always day.""
""Then how do they sleep?""
""What? wha-- Did someone drop you on your fucking head?""
""How can they drop me onto my own head?""
""No, not onto your... I meant... ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME?!?""
[After a pause]
""Is it cold up there?""

""Hey Santa, I brought you some orange juice.""
""What's in it?""
""Oranges""

""What's their names?""
""Who?""
""The elves.""
""Iunno kid, I think there is a Sleepy and a Doopey...""
""That's the seven dwarves.""
""Fuck kid I don't know I just call them bub of chief... WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE A FUCKING TEST WITH YOU?""
[Pause]
""How old are they?""

[Kid tugs at his beard and it comes off]
""It's not real.""
""No fucking shit kid.""
""Why?""
""All my real hair fell out.""
""Why?""
""Because I loved a woman who wasn't clean.""
""Mrs. Santa?""
""No, it was Mrs. Santa's sister.""

[""Santa"" and a girl are about to fuck]
""I want to give you you're present santa.""
""What the fuck is it?""
""A wooden pickle, I cut my hand when I was carving it for you.""
""I don't know kid... Thanks""
""You're welcome. Goodnight Santa, goodnight Mrs. Santa's Sister.""

Enough of that. Anymore and you may never want to see the movie. Which would be bad. I recommend this film for anyone who likes dark humor or early Tarantino stuff, this flick has both.

On to the more important part of this... ME *hears crowd moan and/or shot themselves* ...thanks

I'm in a good mood so far but I feel fucking lonely as all hell... Iunno just seems like the people who onced cared... Well I just no longer exist to them it seems.

The other day I remembered something that sounds good now but I doubt is possible anymore. Nikki and Mike where trying to get me to go out with some girl named Sara... I think... But eh, I don't think that is even a glimmer of an option anymore, is it Steph?

Hmm... brb, have to do something really quick.

AHA, done. WHO THE FUCK IS THE CEMETARY PERSON???

Oh well, umm, bored, alone, confused... Fucking headache... Life sucks lol.

Umm... Song and then nothingness.

I've been waiting 
For a sign to lead the way
And to take me there someday
Even maybe 
I will not return again
Deep inside I'm feeling blue

Let us all go to this land that's far away
Don' be frightened - You're not alone

Children of the night
Searching for the light 
Far away
Children of the night
Searching for the light 
Far away

I'm still waiting 
For a call to lead me there
I've been living in despair
Night is falling
Feel the darkness closing in
There is no way out of here

Let us all go to this land that's far away
Don' be frightened - You're not alone

Children of the night
Searching for the light 
Far away
Children of the night
Searching for the light 
Far away

In a night - In a dream
You have always seemed to be
Take my hand - Don't be scared
One can never be prepared

"event","I told Brandon that I was pretty sure Carol wanted to break up or at least was discontented with the way things were. As it turns out... IMMA FUCKING GENIOUS! I really don't know how things are going right now but the only way I see it working right now (because i read her journal and she seems to really like someone else and not me, at least that way anymore) is us splitting and just remaining friends. I doubt it would ever happen, but I always say ""Maybe someday down the road..."". Meh, who the fuck knows.
Which reminds me... I need to talk to Mike about something, I hope he shows up after school today... Or I'll call him.
Alot of what I will do and how I will act hangs in the balance right now, but Iunno, maybe being single wouldn't kill me. Breh...

As some of you may have guessed, I am keeping this journal, for a little while longer at least.

Umm... I'm out. ""Are we alive or just breathing?""

(faded) This is my last serenade (2X)

This revelation is the death of ignorance
tangled in a state of suffocation
slave to self righteousness
damnation is on your lips

from sorrow to serenity, the truth is absolution
from sorrow to serenity, it's on your head
this is my last serenade
I feel you as you fall away
this is my last serenade
from yourself you can't run away

it's your choice, point the finger
but it's on your head
your destination is a choice within yourself
will you rise or become a slave
to self righteousness
open up your heart and gaze within

from sorrow to serenity, the truth is absolution
from sorrow to serenity, it's on your head
this is my last serenade
I feel you as you fall away

"event","Allrighty then, it is so good to know I have true friends! Oh goodness yes!

In other words, with certain exceptions, FUCK YOU ALL!

I'm not decided yet but I may be dropping this journal and moving to a new site. Oh well, like you fucking care right.

Things are still good with Carol and I hope it will stay that way.

Honestly now, there are only a few I am afraid to lose, but all of you know me and you know I would not do the kind of shit that Kat is saying I did. NOR DID ANYONE ELSE!!! It was a fucking observation assholes! And almost all of you FUCKING AGREED WITH ME! So, while you are trying to cut ties with me, remember what you did say too.

Oh yeah, Brandon I thought of a song you could post in your journal. Smashed Into Peices by Silverstein

This may be the last entry so, Good bye!


Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb

No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through:

You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears
(and taste the blood she cries
and taste the blood she cries)

No:This gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

I'll watch you call, calling for me,
you can't bring back time...
Close your eyes and look away,
fate exposed won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
descending entity in me

My voice has been taken from me.
The more I listen, the more I have to say"

Uggh, do you know how fucking is to write things like that?

CAROL BLEW ME A KISS ON THE WEBCAM! *runs around in idiotic circles* I love her lol.
She grabbed her arse too lol.

Imma go. MY 30 MINUTE SONG!

Cold and misty morning, I heard a warning borne in the air
About an age of power where no one had an hour to spare,
Where the seeds have withered, silent children shivered, in the cold
Now their faces captured in the lenses of the jackals for gold.
I'll be there
I'll be there
I will be there.

Suffering in silence, they've all been betrayed.
They hurt them and they beat them, in a terrible way,
Praying for survival at the end of the day.
There is no compassion for those who stay.
I'll be there
I'll be there
I will be there.

There must be someone who can set them free:
To take their sorrow from this odyssey
To help the helpless and the refugee
To protect what's left of humanity.
Can't you see
Can't you see
Can't you see.

I'll be there
I'll be there
I will be there;
To heal their sorrow
To beg and borrow
Fight tommorow.

All our own. All our own.
Come and see the show! Come and see the show! Come and see the show!
See the show!


Man alone; born of stone; 
Will stamp the dust of time 
His hands strike the flame of his soul; 
Ties a rope to a tree and hangs the Universe 
Until the winds of laughter blows cold. 

Fear that rattles in men's ears 
And rears it's hideous head 
Dread .... Death .... in the wind .... 

Man of steel pray and kneel 
With fever's blazing torch 
Thrust in the face of the night; 
Draws a blade if compassion 
Kissed by countless Kings 
Whose jewelled trumpet words blind his sight. 

Walls that no man thought would fall 
The altars of the just 
Crushed .... Dust .... in the wind .... 

No man yields who flies in my ship 
DANGER! 
Let the bridge computer speak 
STRANGER! 
LOAD YOUR PROGRAM. I AM YOURSELF. 

No computer stands in my way 
Only blood can cancel my pain 
Guardians of a new clear dawn 
Let the maps of war be drawn. 

Rejoice! Glory is ours! 
Our young men have not died in vain, 
Their graves need no flowers 
The tapes have recorded their names. 

I am all there is 
NEGATIVE! PRIMITIVE! LIMITED! I LET YOU LIVE! 
But I gave you life 
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO? 
To do what was right 
I'M PERFECT! ARE YOU?"

Carol was supposed to be on but I don't see her *looks* nope still not there... I'm worried a little, she seems like she would be happier if I didn't call her or something... Iunno.
I hope she comes online soon... It is awesome to talk to her. I'm going to get kicked the hell off soon too.

Imma sing *sings along to song listed below*

I have a horrible voice. I... am just... I just have... I feel horrible about myself... Shut up Ethan you're bitching *shuts up*

Later

Believe it or not the following is a 4 minute song

Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown
Cause everyone around's so hollow
I'm alone
Sometimes I think I'm going down
But no one makes a sound
They follow
And I'm alone
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed
Just to find tomorrow
One more day and I'd be amazed
Just to see it waiting
And if I make it I'm still alone
No more hope for better days
But if I could change
Then I'd really be amazed
And when you know you can't relate
To one more shiny face
Your heart breaks
No one cares
And when you know you can't go on
Cause everything is wrong
Your heart breaks
But no one's there"

The Sky, for lack of light, she shunned
For me, her smile is the brightest thing I need
Her warm loving heart brings in the light
Wear my heart as a jacket, its cold tonight

Take this heart and remember my words
They were meant for you forever
You don't think you're perfect, not to others
Know you are perfection to me
Your beauty is unsurpassed and will be so for years
One thing I promise you is no more tears

These are my feelings for you my siren goddess
My goddess, her name is Carol
Hold my heart, it is yours now
I hope it keeps you happy
With the thought that there is naught
That I would ever do to hurt you

With this hymn you fall asleep
I hope you'll dream of me
I will still be here when you awake
Every nightmare you will have
I will kiss away forever
Every sweet dream you will have
I will make a reality

These are my promises to you my goddess Carol
I love you more by the passing of each day
There is no way this will cease
She is my siren and I am the boat
Blessfully wrecked at her feet
My goddess, her name is Carol"

I hope I have and can make you smile.

I love her... its very bad when she's upset. I wish I could see her and/or do something for her.

""It was a quiet night... Didn't I die?""
from one of my songs...

Later...

Never Again.
I'll slit my throat with the knife I pulled out of my spine. 
Maybe when you find out that I'm dead, 
you'll realize what you did to me.

[Chorus]
And if my lungs still let me breathe, 
would you be there for me. 
If I can make myself believe, 
I'll give you back what you took away.

No, I won't let it go. 
Douse myself in gasoline. 
So don't save me when you come into the fire. 
I'd rather die than have to see your smile.

You made me swear <i>[x2]</i>. 
I can't sleep. 
Realize all the things that you took from me. 
Smash my heart (you made me swear) 
into dust.(you made me swear) 
Suffocate my mind.(you made me swear)
Tear at me from inside.(you made me swear)
Smash apart what you created. 
How can i ever stop you from crushing my soul? 
It was yours to begin with"

part of a song i'm working on

It's over
You cut my throat with your lips

Where would you run with me gone?
It's over

Hey there,
I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all.
Where you are and how you feel.
Put these lights off as these wheels
keep rolling on and on. (and on and on and on...)
Slow things down or speed them up.
Not enough or way too much. (and on and on and on...)
Are you and I gone?

And I can't make it on my own.
(And I can't make it on my own.)
Because my heart is in Ohio.

So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight or die.
Because you kill me.
You know you do, you kill me well.
You like it too, and I can tell.
You never stop until my final breath is gone.

Spare me just three last words.
""I love you"" is all she heard.
I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever."

Talked to Carol for a bit last night. It was cool... although it seems almost as if she's not happy with me anymore, that or I'm not making her happy like I used to... I'm sorry Carol... I'll try harder. I want you to be the happiest person on the planet, and I'll do anything to make you feel that way.

Too many people... are doing this... and I'm falling down with them. Sam is going to commit suicide, or so her journal says. David is pissed and depressed. I don't know what is going on with everyone else... because no one every tells me. I'm just *deep breath* I hope this will go away... It must just be the fucked up shit already happening in school.

Carol,
I don't know if I've done or said anything wrong... But I want you to know I still think (and always will) you are the most gorgeous and sweet person on the planet. You are perfect.

This place rings with echoes of
Lives once lived, but now are lost
Times spent wondering about tomorrow

I dont care, if we lose it all tonight
Up in flames, burning bright
Warming the air of the world

""I dont love you anymore"", is all
I remember you telling me, never have I felt so cold
But I've no more blood to bleed
'cause my heart has been drained into the sea

Steps I take in your footsteps
Are getting me closer to what is left
Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know

Within my bones this resinates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?

""I dont love you anymore"", is all
I remember you telling me, never have I felt so cold
But I've no more blood to bleed

But still I wait untill again we meet, untill again we meet

"event","Nick was only 16, but he had given up on life a while ago. It really wasn't too much that 

finally pushed him off the edge. Nick was, regretibly single. His last girlfriend broke his 

heart into a million little peices, but she was kind enough to lend him super-glue to fix it 

afterward.
Like was said, it wasn't much to set Nick off a final and possibly fatal time.

""Nick, guess what?"" His best friend Sara asked with her usual preppy/hyper disposition.
Nick rolled his eyes slightly, merely meaning it as a joke... Honestly, Nick half expected, 

half wanted, Sara to say she liked him, because he liked her for a long time. ""What is it, 

queen gumdrops? Break a nail?""
Sara giggled, that was what she did. ""No... Me and Greg are going out!""
Nick stared for a moment.
""Nick? Nick where are you going? Are you okay?"" Her voiced trailed off as he left her 

behind.

Nick layed down on his bed and turned his radio on, some love song came on... He threw his 

chair at it and broke it and the chair. He reached into his mattress and pulled back a set 

of bloody fingers. He swore a bit and tried again. This time he pulled out a very large and 

very sharp razor blade. He put it to his wrist...

The phone rang and out of sheer terror, since no one ever calls his phoneline and everyone 

just calls the main one, he dropped the razor. Nick dove for the phone and answered it with 

a shaky hand.
""Hello?""
""Hey hun,"" said the soothing voice on the other end. ""It's Marie...""
Nick shook slightly. ""I know."" he really didn't.
""Oh okay, so what's up babe?""
""Umm, nothing much... How about with you?""
""Umm..."" He pushed the razors under his bed. ""Nothing really just hanging out. How's life?""
You could hear her smiling as she thought of a cheerful line. ""Great... now.""
Nick couldn't believe how happy this simple call made him, then a thought struck him... ""I 

like her,"" He said aloud.
""Who now?""
""Uh, umm?""
""Aww, come on tell me who.""
""You.""
That is what started it.

SIX MONTHS LATER

""Haha, I can't believe you did that!"" Marie said laughing like a madly drunk woman.
""Heh, well you did ask me to slap your ass."" Nick replied.
""I never meant you to hike up my skirt first, everone saw my thong.""
Nick grabbed her tight and kissed her passionately. ""And now, they're all insanely jealous 

that I'm the only one you'll let do that.""
She giggled and blushed slightly, he kissed her warm cheek.
""And that too.""

SEVEN YEARS LATER

The Bride's March filled the chaple as the glowing gorgeous Marie stepped down the eisle in 

her dad's arms. She stepped up to Nick and they shared a deep meaningful glance.

""I hear they have written their own vows...""
""This is correct father.""
""Proceed.""
""I,"" Nick started, ""promise to do more for Marie then any other man on the world has ever 

done for anyone, much less anyone they loved as much as I love her. I promise to make her 

cry... with happiness, until her eyes dry up, then I shall drench her in love. Forever, I am 

yours.""
Marie cryed so hard her friend told the pastor she would read her vows later.

TEN YEARS LATER

""I always promised I would do this one day... I promise to love this man and give him 

whatever he desires that I can deliver. I will do whatever for him, because I love him more 

than he will ever know."" Marie smiled as tears ran from her eyes.

Decades passed and now, they were the kindly old couple that everyone knows. They proved 

that love could really work.
One day, while holding Marie's hand, Nick had to tell her something.
""You know Marie? That day you called me and we started going out, I was about to kill myself 

that day. You saved my life.""
""NICK!"" She screamed, ""What's happening to your arms?""
Nick looked down at his arms and they were gushing blood all over. His life fell backwards 

and suddenly he was a teenager again, except this time he was bleeding all over his sheets. 

The phone started to ring.
With his last breath he read out the name from the caller id.
""guuup, guuup, Marieeee..."""

*singing* I talked to Carol... but I shot the deputy. *shakes head* What the fuck was that?
I love talking to Carol, she has such a great voice and she is so lovely *grins* my siren goddess. ""She is my siren and I'm the boat blessfully wrecked at her feet.""
Someday soon, I really hope I will get to see her in the flesh and hang out with her. She deserves flowers and chocolates, but what will she get? I'll figure something out.

I've been hanging out with Dave and Erika a lot. Just in case you don't know, they are going out. It has been pretty much fun... Cept Jake has been a jerk sometimes, Erika too, but not as much.

I've been so stressed man, it would be awesome if I could hang out with Carol. I wanna give her a huge hug and a soft kiss.
I'm out.

Run fast and move quick
It's our time well thats it
With tail spins and backwinds
Pass go now play again
With handshakes and friendships
The sales pitch, well thats it

We gotta find a way
To get the hell out
We gotta find a way
To get the hell out of town

I'll take a bet on a train wreck
Even though it hasn't happened yet
Guardrails and safe bails
Nice and easy well oh well
Hear a name or an echo
Talk is cheap, just let it go

We gotta find a way
To get the hell out
We gotta find a way
To get the hell out of town

Can you feel it up the back of your neck?
Hold your breath don't let go
This town has so many ghosts
That it scares the hell out of me
Who's the sucker now, look around
I still don't believe
Hold tight, deep breath, best part ain't over yet
Clenched fist, your chest, pounding heart, it ain't over yet

This place has so many echoes
Let's go let's go let's go
This place has so many ghosts
Let's go let's go let's go
This place has so many echoes
Let's go let's go let's go

I went to Brandon's yesterday, it was alot of fun all day with the exception of my brother turning into the biggest fag on the planet and bad-mouthing Carol. I wanted to fucking strangle him. Brandon was the only one who remained quiet. I'm not sure what Kat's opinion really is but you know what? I DON'T FUCKING CARE! I like her and I think she's gorgeous, and that is enough for me, and I hope for her.

PRINGLES CANNON!

I talked to Carol when I got home. Wow, just hearing her voice helps me to calm down. I talked to her about some cool ideas I had and she seems to be happy to try one of them. If it works, it'll be fucking awesome! By the way, I need about $40, can anyone loan me money?

I told Carol that I'd like to know things she likes to get, you know little gifts... She says she has no idea because no one has ever done that for her. Anyone who knew me during my relationship with Erika knows, when I have money, this is an area in which I excel.

I had a lot of nightmares last night. And according to my OWN FUCKING religion, that is a really bad thing. If one of those things come true... I will be on the news, as well as the pavement lol. Some of them were really fucking bad... But I feel better today.
I'm going to try and get a phone card today so I can call Carol and talk to her more about my plan. I hope she talked to her dad yesterday, that woud help the plan along quite well. I'd love just to see her and walk with her.

Well I've got to get going. Someone call me or something I am so fucking bored.

One last thing I beg you please, just before you go
I've watched you fly on paper wings half way round the world until they 
Burned up in the atmosphere and sent you spiraling down
Landed somewhere far from here with no one else around
To catch you falling down and i'm looking at you now

And I cant tell if you're laughing
Between each smile theres a tear in your eye
Theres a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I

Swing for the fences son, He must have told you once
That was a conversation you took nothing from so raise your 
Glass now and celebrate excatly what you've done
Just put off another day of knowing where your from
Catch up with yourself if you run

And I cant tell if you're laughing
Between each smile theres a tear in your eye
Theres a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I

Is this the life that you lead?
Or the life thats left for you?
Will you take the road thats been laid out before you
Will we cross paths somewhere else tonight? somewhere else tonight

And I cant tell if you're laughing
Between each smile theres a tear in your eye
Theres a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I
And I cant tell if you're laughing
Between each smile theres a tear in your eye
Theres a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I"

I talked to her last night *smiles* but only for a short time *frowns* but I wil hopefully talk to her today *smiles again*
She is really really cool, and I love talking to her. *counting under breath* alluring eyes, sweet voice, gorgeousness all over the place... and an absoluely flawless personality.

Kat revived the dying and slightly underused nickname of puppy for me. If you want the explination, ask her.

*dances around* I'm going to the hu ke lau later I think. If anyone wants to hang out with me call and see if I'm home, I'd love the company.

Carol goes to school 2morrow which sucks cause that means I'll see and hear from her less. BUT I WILL SURVIVE! I can't wait til I get my car on the road so I could go see her. I thought of something that would be wicked cool, if me and her were together for sci-techs junior prom, I could go pick her up, but we'd both have to ditch school for two days, I bring her here and go, then she'd prolly have to stay at my house.
I know someone will think thats odd, but it was just a dream people, calm down.
She really is gorgeous, did I mention that?

I said something insightful today.
I told Robyn I was going out with Carol and she said ""having a relationship is overrated but whatever makes you happy""
I said ""it isn't the relationship that makes me happy, robyn, it is her that makes me happy""

those quotes may not be accurate but i like them.

Here's a song that fits really well.

I know it's dark here, you know that I'm scared too
For some reason right now, of everything but you
Right now you're all that I recognize
You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I wait here, and sometimes I get one

It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing 
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on

You know it starts here, outside waiting in the cold
Kiss me once in the snow, I swear it never gets old
But I will promise you I can make it warmer next year
You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I stay here, and everyday I get one

It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing 
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on

We can stay in 'till our southern summer wedding day
Go plug in your electric blanket
We can stay here"

She sent me a great pic of her i thought i saved but i can't find it. She was so pretty in that.
I did a cheesy thing too. I got a pic of flowers and sent it to her.
She has a great voice and I hope to talk to her later.

""Don't forget to let your life rot you inside out."" -Matt Skiba

Suffering from something we're not sure of
In a world there is no cure for
These lives we live test negative for happiness
Flat line, no pulse, but eyes open
Single file like soldiers on a mission
If theres no war outside our heads
Why are we losing?

I don't ask for much
The truth betold i'd settle
for a life less frightening, a life less frightening
I don't ask for much
The truth betold i'd settle
for a life less frightening, a life less frightening

Hang me out to dry Im soaking
With the sense of knowing
Whats gone wrong but doing nothing I still run
Time again I have found myself stuttering
Foundations pulled out from under me
This breath is wasted on them all
Will someone answer me?

I don't ask for much
The truth betold i'd settle
for a life less frightening, a life less frightening
I don't ask for much
The truth betold i'd settle
for a life less frightening, a life less frightening

Is there a God tonight?
up in the sky or is it empty just like me (Just like me)
A place where we can hide out from the night
Where you are all I need (Where you are all I need)
So all he says, Goodbye and close your eyes
Tell me what you see (Tell me what you see)
A life I sit inside this dream of mine
Where you are all I see

I don't ask for much
The truth betold i'd settle
for a life less frightening, a life less frightening
I don't ask for much
The truth betold i'd settle
for a life less frightening, a life less frightening"

Hey, I am alive! *hears crickets* Thanks for the enthusiasm... lol

I had a fucking weird dream of dream, in the dream I told Kat I liked Christine and she said ""Oh really"" then I woke up. I told Kat about that dream and she said ""Mmm"" I asked her why and she said ""Because I couldn't say 'oh really'"" Then I woke up for real.

For the record, I actually do like Christine... It'll go nowhere though, I think, fucking dreams.

Perfect timing eh? Umm... I guess I'm done so umm, song time.


they turn the lights down low,
in shadows hiding from the world,
only coming out when it gets cold

the seas part when they hit the floor,
the voices carry on and out the door
and everything you touch turns into gold

like the angel you are laugh creating a lightness in my chest,
your eyes they penetrate me,
(your answer's always 'maybe')
that's when I got up and left

a beating heart and a microphone,
a ticking clock in an empty home
still tells of these times so long ago,
and even though I've come so far, I know
I've got so far to go and any day now I'll explode

like the angel you are laugh creating a lightness in my chest,
your eyes they penetrate me,
(your answer's always 'maybe')
that's when I got up and left

and each and everyday, will lead into tomorrow,
tomorrow brings one less day without you
but don't wait up just leave the light on
cause all the roads that I might take will all one day lead back to you

and like the angel you are laugh creating a lightness in my chest,
your eyes they penetrate me,
(now this is too amazing)
that's when I got up and left"

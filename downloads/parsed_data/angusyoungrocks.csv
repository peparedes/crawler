"event","i was just thinking...
what if our entire universe is just one atom in an infinitly bigger universe and what if every one of our atoms is just another infinitly smaller universe with its own sentient beings that can think and feel just like us but they are too small for us too ever find out about. that would be crazy. but if you think about it, it is entirely possible. Human's ability to comprehend things like a universe within an atom is almost non-existent.  Just like infinity. No human can comprehend the idea of something not ending, everything in our world, everything that any human has experienced has a definite beginning and end so how could we possible comprehend something as small or big as a universe within a single atom.  And what if there is life out there that can comprehend something like infinity that doesn't end. i wonder if that will ever happen. that would be cool if aliens came to earth in my lifetime, kinda scary too.  It's kinda funny too that humans have the inquisitive mind to cross oceans on ships made of wood powered by wind and fly to the moon and back, but we are still all cowards at heart.  As long as we are in control of the situation we would be fine but if some other force enters it then we become terrified and try to find something to destroy so that we are the higher being, but when we find nothing we only hurt ourselves.... wow some of that makes absolutely no sense.... well i got nothing better to do at 11:30 on a friday night when no one else is online. i suppose i could practice guitar or play zelda but i don't think i will. oh well i am lonely i think i will got to bed now and listen to radiohead, i stole one of their cd's from ted's house. well actually i asked him if i could have it and he said sure. well i am gonna split hope you all are enjoying life right now."

"event","Well i just finished listening to Beethoven's violin concerto in D major and writing an essay comparing the poetic works of Emily Dickinson to those of Walt Whitman.  I personally believe that their very different lives had a profound effect on the poetry affect not only their style but also the subject matter.  I also believe that their works were drawn together through common ground that is basic transcendentalist beliefs, although both poets had their own beliefs. Dickinson for example agreed with the idea that the human mind is the most powerful entity in the universe. This is evident in ""The brain is wider than the sky"" and the last two lines of ""There is a solitude of space"" but she clearly has some inner conflict going on in that the first two stanzas she claims the brain is larger than the sky and the sea, but in the last stanza she says that the brain is equal to that of God. So clearly there is conflict between her religious beliefs and transcendentalist beliefs because if she knew what she truly believed in there would be no doubt in her mind and one would be above the other. BUt since there is that equality she clearly knows not which to pick.
... ok that's enough talk like that i alread wrote about this in my essay i don't want to do it again. although i did sound pretty smart and sophisticated i gotta admit. I bet chicks dig sophisticated guys. if any girls read this tell me if my assumptions prove to be correct."

"event","i got a haircut today, i think it looks alright. i know everyone will hate it though and rip on me the entire fucking day. but whatever they can all go to hell. I have been thinking alot lately( i have nothing to do with my time) and i wonder why girls (particularly Jen and Carly) don't like me. So i thought of all the reasons why. My personality is one, and attraction is the main other one i am guessing. And then i got to thinking, am i attractive or ugly. and if i am ugly why won't someone tell me so that at least i know why girls don't like. But then also i got to thinking that beauty is in the eye of the beholder so beauty really depends on the person who is looking at something. And if it depends on the other person then really beauty doesn't exist, it is all just in someone elses head so no one is good looking or ugly it all just depends. and i guess that made me feel a bit better about my life, but ultimately it is still pointless. I keep waiting for something to happen to give me a reason to wake up in the morning but it never happens. I wonder why man as a being always hopes for things. i guess it's cause humans have the ability to desire things for more than just survival needs and such so they hope for something that would make them happy. But then i got to thinking what would really make me happy. I guess just feeling appreciated by people. i don't really feel appreciated though. but whatever at least i still have jethro tull to listen to. They're pretty sweet. oh well life goes on. maybe something cool will happen tomorrow, most likely not but just maybe."

"event","The last two days were some of the worst days of my life. I am always pissed off. Nothing makes me happy anymore, except driving around with ted that was fun. I honestly can't think of any conceivable reason for getting up in the morning, apart from my parents make me. I am so sick of waking up every morning knowing that this day will be the exact same as the day before which was the same as the day before, which was the same as the day before and so on and so forth. I just wish someone or something would break the cycle. I probably should but i don't think I have the courage. I feel like a fucking cow cause my life has had nothing different for a really long time. I wish Carly or Jen would notice me. They are both babes, but they never do notice me. I guess I just sort of blend in with the surrounding cause i don't really stand out or anything. It's kinda hard to when you are forced to do wear the same clothes as everyone else and expected to act like everyone else. I wish I was more confident about myself. Self-confidence is really hard to get though. I used to actually be pretty confident or maybe just so apathetic that i didnt' care what people though so i would do whatever. Maybe i just care too much about what people think. I shouldn't really worry about stuff. i always tell myself to just say hi to jen but i never can gain the courage. i don't know why women are so intimidating but i just can't gain the confidence to make two simple sounds in my vocal chords and mouth making the word ""hi"" i really hope teenagers are supposed to be this confused cause if not I am in big trouble. I always seem to know the answer to other peoples problems, at least i think i do, but i can never apply that to my own so i just recede back to solitude. I guess i just don't like alot of people. Well i am rambling now if you wanna comment go for it, it would be pretty sweet of you. well catch you all later. Enjoy life for what it is, a chance to do something great, and not what you think it should be. ( did that make any sense? i have been trying to come up with philosophical quotes that make me sound cool, if you have any comments on that as well it would be greatly appreciated)"

I mean people are starving and being slaughtered across the world, but do people care? know they are two worried about their fucking hummers and lexus's. all we want is the quick fix, if you have a problem put it in the back of your mind and go for immediate gratification that keep your mind busy enough to not have to worry about problems. and then if you do it enough you will never have to worry about any problems again. i don't understand how humans can go thousands of year's improving themselves only to destroy themselves within a century. just look at how many fat people there are due to marketing and greed, while in ethiopia a fucking mcdonalds cheeseburger would be enough to sustain someone for a week cause there bodies are used to getting nothing but a couple handfuls of rice a week.  And america is sitting on fucking silos of grain afraid to share it incase they become dependant on it.

"event","God dammit, those fuckers at the bank are such fuckers. ok here is what happened: i went to the bank to take out some money cause i have been broke for like the past month and a half. so then i go in and fill out the little form to get the money. i got up and give them my school i.d. and they say it invalid. that pissed me off enough so i went outside and got my mom to come in and she said ""my son has an account here and he needs his money"" (or something like that) and then they don't even ask her for an id. they didn't even know it was my mom. it could have been some crack head i found off the street. and they say it's to protect my money. honestly they said i needed a drivers license. i can't get a drivers license!!! so that means any guy with my bank account number and a fake drivers license could steal my money!! would they even check to see if i could even have a drivers license?!?!? no they wouldn't but my school id is not valid. god that really pisses me off just because i am not a legal adult means i can't do anything for myself. i know at least a dozen legal adults that i am much more mature and intelligent than ( i doubt i actually know them but i am sure they exist) god those sluts."

"event","man i was looking through my dad's records and i found alot of cool ones. like there is jimi hendrix live at the monterey pop festival, which was his first performance in the US. then i found a lou reed album. i have no idea what it will sound like but he is my hero (along with angus young of course) so i want to listen to it. i also found led zeppillin one which was i lost for a while. it is scratched to hell but i will listen to it anyway. i think it was there best album because it was them at their simplest. i think that's the same with a lot of bands. like ac/dc there earlier stuff with bon scott is better than with brian johnson (both era's are incredible no doubt about it). man i love music. i would probably have nothin without it. i don't understand how people cannot listen to music. oh well those crazy fool. so yah my dad has a lot of cool records, and that is the moral of this update. i hope you can all go away with something from this."

"event","hmmm my weekend has been pretty bittersweet. Friday night i gotta admit,was pretty sweet. i was so high i was hallucinating. It was so weird cause like my friend matt was sitting there on the couch. I looked down and then back up and he was like a giant. he looked like he was really close and about eight feet tall. then, you know how when on a movie someone is on a green screen there is this little like white line surround him, well there was one like that around matt, only he had a completely different face. and like the shadows on his face were fuckin purple and green. it was pretty righteous. then ted's brother talked to us about drugs and stuff. i don't remember much. shayla also met billy corgan which is sweet for her, but it kinda made me sad cause i know i will probably never meet angus young.... oh well. and if she gives all her love to billy there is none left for me, which is kinda sad but oh well it's still sweet she met him. then today i didn't do much except sleep and try to do homework. i went to anna's party which was super awkward cause i didn't know anyone. then they played spin the bottle which i chose not to take part in cause my sister was playing and i am not the kinda guy to take risks like that. then my sister and i drove home and we ended up in wisconsin which was kinda weird but we got home alright. we talked about alot of stuff like drugs and such. yah she isn't particularly for them but she won't like rat me out or anything which is good. yah so that's my weekend if any of you really care. and i still have one more day to do crazy stuff. it should be fun."

nothin to live for
but no reason to die
you always want more
and all you do is lie
honestly i have no idea why i wrote that. it means nothing but whatever. but then again maybe it does. oh well hmmm maybe i can play megaman. i kinda don't want to though. hmmm i hate it when my sister has to call someone and i can't be online. it seems like when i am not with people the internet is what keeps me from getting super depressed. i don't really want to be addicted to the internet though. oh well i got time to fix it."

"event","i had one of the greatest days ever. honestly it rivals the times that i have gotten wasted off my ass (which is really only twice). first i had co choir which kinda sucked but oh well. then i went to bundy's and we hung out and stuff. then we went to garomoni's house when the real fun began. we just looked around his house and garage at first which was fucking amazing cause he has so much sweet stuff, like a frikkin fire truck. then we went to crossroads and he called me a yuppie repeatedly for ordering a rueben sandwhich. it was quite good however. then we went back and we brought out greg's mini bike. let me tell you that thing was fucking amazing!!! we took it to this construction site with this track that went around it and such. then when i was going up the hill the chain feel off and got completely tangled up and it took us like an hour and a half to finally fix it after we jammed a stick in it and hit it with a rock. it was sweet cause we did it. then i rode it around some and we went back to gregs house. then we just sat around and such. then i went home at about 5:00 or and i ate dinner. then i went to ted's and we tried to get cigarettes but it didn't work. then we went to ted's and played a sweet game of risk. for the first five turns it was anyone's game except matt's cause he didn't really have much. then at turn five i made an alliance with doug and ted made an alliance with matt. well alot happened but the important part is that matt and i had basically put everyone of our armies on these two territories but neither of us would attack eachother so then finally he attacked me and it was like thirty armies against thirty and i put up a good fight but in the end he beat me which was pretty amazing. and then i left and it was fun. yah that's my day."

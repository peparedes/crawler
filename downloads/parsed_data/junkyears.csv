"event","i work way to hard for my age. i should be in school with a bunch of friends and nothing to worry about, but instead i work all the time. i only get one day a week off (which is usually friday). i have like fifty different sores all over my body and i'm pretty sure most of them are from work. but i love it most of the time cause i don't have to deal with a bunch of shit like home work or getting kicked out for beating the shit out of people or getting in trouble for swearing or all that stuff. there is one thing i have to remember is that i just got a raise and that my boss loves me."

"event","so i've been working with ashley alot lately and she keeps me calm with all of our stories! like the time ashley, keisha, and i got in a drinking contest (it seems i was the only one not completely trashed that night) and keisha throw up all over my couch. funny but gross! and the story of fluff bunny to make a long story short we both lagh our asses off and then keisha yelled at us(this was before ashley could bet her up) so after 20 minutes of laughuing we both finally shut up. and then she just had to pick on me all day (this included a wet comet rag and lots of talking.  then she showed me a pic of her wedding dress (which is completely beautiful!) and she told me how jackie was excepting to be one of the brides maids and that she pissed ashley off by talking about something that would upset any girl(i would tell but it's none of your business) and that she fells a little bad but with what she said it just makes it bad. i can't wait  for their wedding though it's gonna be so cool!

                                              I got told another funny story about keisha!(i can't tell all of it though) well onfe night she wanted some (i cant call it by it's real name so i'll use nosehair)nosehair and she said she would sleep with this one dude to get it and when he heard he freaked and ran!hten these dudes dared her to sleep with this butt ugly guy and she said yes of course (what they didn't tell her was that the guy had paid them ato dare her and it was totally funny)and then me and ashley were watched for about an hour after lunch which didn't suprise me cause every day i work that happens. today we had to do high low which means we have to clean our rooms from top to bottom  and there was one part of the bathroom that i happened to forget to do and that was the bottms of the toliets, after we got the bottom of the 22 finished i had to go back and wash all to bottoms of the toilets. it's sad but true!

                                                  i find it sad how many drinking stories me and ashley have with each other, like the time she was so plastered that she ran into a wall and hit her head really hard and i couldn't let her got o sleep until i was sure she didn't have any head injurys (the whole time i was checking she laughed cause i was freaking out)and then the other time when we were so drunk we stood on the side of the street trying oto get some guys to notice us ( and just so you know it worked)and then the time both me and her out drank paul it was really sad cause he loves wild turkey and yet we could drink so much moree of it then him it wasn't funny ok it was funny.and then the first time we did nosehair(well it wasn't my first time) that was weird but we never did it agian cause we didn't want to be like keisha and suck cock for and i'm not joking she really did buit hten again she was a retard.

                                       the other day ashley told me a story about how this guy was goimg out with keisha and how she was telling this other guy and he said he would never go out with her and then, cause she left herself open there i told her i wouldn'y go out with her sister either! it was so funny at the time. today at lunch me and kristen were dancing to the music in my head it was chutes and ladders by korn and it was so fun!

                   well that includes all the details of today and well i have nothing else really to say so bye for now!

"event","i have a really good idea, ok the guy i like wants me to do something to his hair and i should invite him over and then just get on him then (it will take a long time for me to do his hair anyways, so why not get some while he's here)and it was my brother who said i would and i told him ok but it will take about 3 hours and he said it was ok.and of course he wants to do me. so i think i will just be a slut like i normally am.

                       ao any way i have a new man toy (i was gonna say boy but that would be a lie cause he's about 24) and i want to ""fool around"" with him and his married ass(well thats what i've been told) and he wants my cute ass in the back seat of his car. lissy if you read this call me!so my new man flesh works at the chevron(which is part of the thunder bird) so i see him about every day at least 2 times, and every time we see each other all we can do is hit on each other and flirt none stop, he even gives me ""the look"" and i love it, it just gets me going. and his ass is so hot i could just eat it for lunch, very edible.i want his little man in me. well thats enough about him and his man flesh. well i got to go. pleaz post

"event","i don't like some people. they are stupid, ugly, fat, no breasted butt ugly girls that suck cock for crack. i just think  that  chic should be kicked off the face of the planet cause nobody likes her because shes a dirty whore. i would have said slut but i get called that and i am a whole lot hotter than she is cause i have boobs and they are really big. i don't like this girl cause she has her eye on the guy that i've been trying to get with and if she doesn't back off i will personally kick her in the butt. i do not like her, but i'm too nice to hate her. i just think she should go for some one more her type. then again she doesn't have a type, she just sleeps around and i can't wait till the one day when she has a std and she is all broken and she regets what she did when she was younger.and then i will laugh at her. but any way that guy i like is going to be at my house on saturday to party with ny oldest brother cause he graduated. and then i will have my chance to ""get to know him"" and i will ""get to know him"" all night long. and maybe again in the morning. but i have to work sunday, so i can't party to hard. but i'm going to get with him no matter what it takes. and then if i do ""get to know him"" on saturday i will rub it in to that chics face and then laugh at her. but then when i think about me and what i would really do, i'd end up keeping it to myself and only tell ashley and maybe sandera too. but i really like him and he is so my type and no one can see that but me. so i told my oldest brother and he told his friend and they said that if i went out with him they would both kick his ass even though they are both his friends and they both are my friends  but i will talk them into letting me go out with him without them kicking his ass. i can't wait till saturday i will wear my new thong (it's black leather w/two straps going around and they have two buckles) and i will do my makeup and put myself out there in the open. and he will get there about ten-thirty to elevn and then i will put myself out and get him to talk to me. and then what ever happens after then should be ""fun"" hopefully! i just really hope he likes me, cause i really like him. well i got to go and think about weither or not to go to class.

"event","i'm in Moose Jaw! and it's FREEZING!
we landed in -47 and it's -30 today.

i have two new jobs: working at a francophone school, Ecole Ducharme, and the Western Development Museum.
i'm house manager this week with Anna, so i haven't done anything exciting yet.

we go to the Y quite regularly. they have a biking game set up where you chase dragons. this is my new exercise regimen.

my bipolar is acting up again a bit; cycles are being disruptive and i spent a good part of yesterday just laying in bed. here's hoping it's just the weather and adjustments to Saskatchewan.

my new cluster is pretty awesome. they were in Halifax and Bridgewater previously, so i had some good chats about my greatly missed city.

my head is being pulled in two directions, the West Coast and Montreal. i don't know what to do except wait.

my work gave me a very sweet goodbye. one gift i received was Gifts of Unknown Things by Lyall Watson. it's extremely interesting and makes me think (always a good thing).

give me courage to work in French next week! i'm terrified!"

"event","i miss writing.
i used to sit in coffeeshops or the library with my laptop and write for hours about anything and everything that was on my mind, the people around me, any inspiration that sparked connections between words in my mind.


one of my favourite writing activities:
go into a coffeeshop or restaurant. 
have your laptop open in front of you.
get a big cup of something delicious.
adopt a look of preoccupation.
open a blank word or notepad document.
eavesdrop on neighbouring tables and write down what you hear.


i miss my laptop and i miss all my writing files. :(
i'm trying to keep up with writing and keep the sparkplugs going but it is difficulttttttt."

"event","Once upon a time, a girl named Enid came home from conversing with the goddesses to find a small package laying in front of her door. Inside was a small bulb which she placed into a pot of soil and watered and tended to daily. One day the plant began to flower and a small blonde child emerged. Enid begat her the name von Blondie and from that day forth, they were an inseparable creative force beyond measure. They are known as The Snowbabies and they do as they please.

i adore my coworkers! they take me for drives in the country and shopping at the thrift store across the street and they make me herbal tea for when i arrive at work and again for after lunch.



a housemate asked me to sing him soft tunes, so i sang and a voice came from between my lips that i've never heard from before. i don't know what brought this voice into being, but i would like this voice to stay.
i would like to believe that BC is making my voice beautiful again (but to be honest it's most likely because i'm not smoking anymore).

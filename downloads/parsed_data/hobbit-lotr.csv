MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

FRIDAY THE 13TH FACTS... 
DID YOU KNOW !?!?? 

According to Smithsonian Magazine ""fear of the #13 costs American a billion dollars per year in absenteeism, train and plane cancellations,  and reduced commerce on the 13th of the month."" 
* 
Fear of Friday the 13th dates back to Nordic Mythology.  Many of their thirteenth Gods met with violent deaths, such as Loki, the trickster. 
* 
Ancient Romans regarded the number 13 as a symbol of death, destruction and misfortune. 
* 
Lizzy Borden uttered a total of 13 words at her trial. 
* 
There were 13 original colonies. 
* 
A witches coven consists of 13 members. 
* 
Tarot Card number 13 is the Death Card, depicting the Grim Reaper 
(although it is read as transition or change and not literal death). 
* 
Hotels rarely have a room number 13.  Usually it is called 12a or 14.  Same with floors of buildings and the elevators without a #13 button.  Highways sometimes will skip exit 13 altogether also. 
* 
There are 13 steps leading to the gallows. 
* 
13 knots in a hangman's noose. 
* 
13 feet which the guillotine blade falls. 
* 
The driver of Princess Diana hit pillar #13 at Place de l'Alma when she was killed in Paris, France. 
* 
13 people, Christ and his 12 disciples, were in attendance at the last supper.  This is where the Christian belief ties in, making Friday a believed unlucky day, as the crucifixion occurred on a Friday. 
* 
Certain ocean liners will be held in dock until after midnight to appease passenger's fears on Friday the 13th. 
* 
British study concluded that even though there were less cars on the road on Friday the 13th 
(as compared with other Fridays) more accidents were reported. 
* 
Trisadekaphobia is the technical name for fear of Friday the 13th. 
* 
Apollo 13, 1970, the 13th mission launched from pad #39 (13 x 3), mission was aborted, after an explosion occurred in the fuel cell of their service module.  The rocket had left launcing pad at 13:13 CST and the date was April 13th. 
* 
Epluribus Unum has 13 letters. 
* 
The US Seal has 13 stars, bars, feathers in the eagle's tail, 13 bars in one claw, 13 olive branches in the other. 
* 
A ""quatrorzieme"" is a professional 14th guest hired by the French who had only 13 guests in attendance for dinner, who felt that was unlucky. 
* 
A baker's dozen consists of 13 for a reason! So the story goes a witch near Albany, NY demanded 13 items every time she came in to a particular bakery, and one day the old baker could not afford her extra biscuit. She sneered some strange words at the man, and he suffered terrible luck from then on, until he brought her another 13 rolls. After that life was once again easy for the baker and word spread around town.  The custom is still sometimes practiced today. 

Have a great EVIL day!! MWAHAHAHA!

I wont say how much it cost because I have to pay it back to my step mom ^_^ but I will say that it is worth it! I just need to get some telephoto lenses and stuff so I can take better pictures. This camera is so complicated, it has 6.3 mega pix, the resolution is amazing. Lighting is the thing I am having a hard time with. I have to learn how to use natural light and stuff blah! I'm now a photographer in training. YAY!</P>

<P>Today I went out and took some pictures at this park in Frisco on my way home from school. ""It face"" went with me, I took lots of pretty pictures of waterfalls and stuff. The most amazing thing happened though, I was clicking away and Christa found this Hawk that was eating something just around this wall thing. I don't have a good lens, but I still got some awesome pictures of it. Check them out. The one of the butterfly and hawk were cropped. The waterfall one is in its normal format. Sorry there are so many pictures, I am just so excited that I finally got my camera!</P>

"event","I just read this story for English called The Perfect Picture by James Alexander Thom. I will give you a little summery of what it was about. The author talks about what happened when he went to get a story, he is a newspaper reporter. He goes to this house and sees this guy looking shocked standing in his driveway surrounded by news reporters sticking their microphones in his face. He just backed over his 3-year-old granddaughter and her body was in their kitchen, with the police. As the reporter came towards the shocked man the other reporters left so they could examine the body because the grandfather wasn't answering their questions. The reporter stood by him and the grandfather is staring at the spot where the little girl died saying in disbelief that he wanted to put some dirt in his flower garden and didn't even know the little girl was outside. The reporter leaves him to give him a moment alone, and goes to find a picture of the girl to put in the newspaper. After he finds a picture he goes to see the body and sees this perfect picture that completely captures the moment. The grandfather is sitting at the table with his arms around the tiny body wrapped in a white sheet. Through the window behind him the reporter sees the truck that hit her and next to it the parents of the little girl struck with grief because they just found out their daughter was dead. The reporter wants to take a picture but cant bring himself to do it because it would disturb the grandfather in his grief. That's about the end.

This really made me think because I watch the news all the time and never really take it in that all these people are in their most painful moments of their lives. Their whole lives are about to change, the loss is so great. I feel bad to think of how many news reports I have watched of people just in total grief. I wonder if they were being treated like the grandfather, and if anyone actually stopped to think oh look someone's grieving lets give them a moment. We just watch these people cry out in pain... someday it might happen to us. But you cant think of this stuff all the time or else it will make you crazy. I think there is a deeper message, in that by seeing all that people lose that we should appreciate what we have. In a moment we could lose everything and only then would we really see all that we have. Maybe that's what we should realize when we see bad things happen, not just feel sorry for that person but let it teach us to be happy with what we have. I have a lot to lose which means I have a lot. I am very lucky for all that I have. I hope you all realize this too, it's a good reason to be happy."

"event","Hey everyone! I am really starting to stress out with all my classes. I thought I was only taking 12 hours but it turns out I am taking 14 hours, 2 of my classes are 4 hours long. Argg! Oh well at least one of them is my computer class that I enjoy. I learned how to use dream weaver the other day, its just like front page only cooler! While my teacher explained how it worked I figured most of it out because I used front page for the last 3 years. Lol I'm a dork, all I had to do was try it and I would have figured out how it works. I'm only talking about the basics by the way, when you get into php and the flash, I still have a lot to learn. ^_^ The classes I am having a hard time in are philosophy and Algebra because of the homework. I have a test this week and 2 more tests next week and a major paper due at the end of this week, I am done with the paper but I still have to review for those tests... grrr. My days are pretty packed and its hard go get used to all this homework. I have no free time! I wish I could go to school without working, that would give me 4 more hours a day to spend either on school or for fun. I enjoy my job though so it's not too bad, I am still going to be a photographer, but I will update you on that laters. :) I got a little digital voice recorder! It's awesome! I can take any thing I record and turn it into a wave and then turn it into an mp3 and burn it on a cd. I haven't turned them into mp3's yet but I have burned them on a cd as a wave, it works the same. Well it is now 2 am I'm off to bed I got to get up at 7am!&nbsp; : / Night!"

"event","&nbsp;Wee, almost Friday! I love Fridays its the only day of the week I don't feel guilty for playing on the computer all night :) Its the only day I don't feel I need to do all my homework. Anyway, I had a good week even though I missed one class and one day of work because I was still a little sick. Its good to be able to breath through your nose again trust me.&nbsp; 
<P>I am really into starting my own business again, with the professional photographer thing. I have been looking at cameras. I know, I know, I just got a new camera, but well I its not good enough for what&nbsp;I am needing to do. the one I like the most is right here:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://possibleuniverse.com/colege/camera.gif""><A href=""http://host115.ipowerweb.com:8080/panel/host/filemanager?func=dl&amp;p=%2Fpublic_html%2Fcolege%2Fcamera.gif""></A></P>
<P>Well thats not really the camera but, its the closest I have found. I cant seem to find the one I saw at the store on any of the Wolf camera websites. I think tomorrow after English I will go check it out and see if I had the wrong name or something. I am really looking forwards to getting this little thing going, mainly because I enjoy it. I have never used a camera so high tech before, but once I get it and start experimenting I bet I will figure it out. ^_^ This way when any of you peoples get married I can be the photographer, however I wont be professional I am still an amateur. hehe</P>
<P>I am also in this really cool Multi Media class, I hope it will give me a little help with flash and dream weaver. I have no clue how to use those because I don't have them. However if I can get the basics then I can decide on if I should get them and build awesomely cool websites with it. Right now I am still stuck in HTML. Hope everyone is having a good Fall semester! ^_^ Well I better go to bed, night!!!</P>"

"event","<P>Yeah, I feel really sick... my head hurts, my throat is sore, my nose is running, and I keep coughing! It started Thursday, but it wasn't as bad as it was today. At least I have a few days to get better so I dont have to miss school. Anyways I am not sure what to write about so I am randomly going to pick from Desiderata, a thing with 12 sayings to live by... and that is really how&nbsp;I try to live my life. </P>
<P>Desiderata - #3, Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome disciplhine, be gentle with yourself. You are a childe of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</P>
<P>True dat, this is my second favorite out of the 12. Because all of us have fears, and we are all pretty tough on ourselfs. Also there is just something about trees that bring peace to our minds. I love trees, there is so much life in them. I love the sound of rain hitting the leaves and watching the wind blow the top branches. They are so beautiful, I feel like&nbsp;I take them for granted.</P>
<P>Stars are so awesome, its so weird when you look up at them. It takes light so many years to travel to&nbsp;us because they are so far away. You are&nbsp;really seeing&nbsp;a moment of that stars past like a photo of the star 100s of years ago. The star could have gone out already but we dont know that because of the light years it takes for that little bit of energy to travel into our eyes. I love how the universe is so wondrous, it reminds me of how magical life is and that we hardly know anything. Lets me look forward to learning more and wonder about what tomorrow will bring. Im so glad I have a chance to experience and be apart of this universe. </P>
<P>We do have a right to be here, its hard to remember that when you feel out of place. All of us are here to experience life, for the better and worse. Its about falling down and getting back up, its about being happy and sad and mad and scared. And through all the stuff we go through, a tree is growing, a flower is blooming and a beautiful world is all around us always. Its like we forget because we only know how to focus on one thing at a time. Life is a wonderful gift, dont waist it on dwelling over things that dont make you happy. Look up at the stars, smell the roses, listen to the rain, because life is short and the more you live, the more you will have.</P>
<P>Desiderata- #12- Be careful. Strive to be happy. (thats my favorite one) </P>"

Lets see what else is going on? Oh! They put me at Castle Hills elem. for my job, and I really like it there. Great kids and great staff. 

Guess what? Im doing my homework, for english we have to write in a live journal 3 times a week, and respond to someone else's once. Sooo yeah, its all good. :) 

I saw IROBOT the other week, I thought it was really good and the graphics rocked! Made me wonder if robots had souls or not. How do you tell if something has a soul? I think its more complicated then a heart beat or a thought. If we are all made of energy, and energy is never created or destroyed do they leave their shells once they shut down like us? I wonder if the 21 grams effect works for robots too... I mean if a robot created a robot, is that like a human giving birth to another human. I dont think that because we programed them to do stuff means they arnt capable of being more.

I love my phylosophy class!!! Its sooo awesome, its like debate in high school all over again only this time we are aloud to actualy debate the values and morals! Why didnt anyone tell me that phylosophy would be such a cool class! I think my teacher wrote my text book because his name is on the cover and its an intresting name. 

Did i mention that It face (aka Christa) is in all my classes exept my multi media class. This way we split the caust of books and gas. Also, we will make good grades, because we are always compeating in grades and stuff. lol I remember my algebra 1 class in highschool, we had algebra 1 at the same time only with different teachers she was in 8th grade I was in 9th. We were placing bets on who would score higher on the E.O.C. Hehe we ended up with the exact same score. Gtg to work! Laters!"

You could tell me the world will end tomorrow and I wouldn't feel a bit of worry. Weird feeling this one. Anyway I hope it lasts because I like it.

Stuff going on in my life:

I'm still working at the day camp for kidos. I love this job! It over pays me and I get to have fun all day! All my money goes to rent and bills but, my mom is giving it back when she gets her income tax. I have to watch what I spend and its teaching me to save. My dad is being the nicest he has ever been before. He is going to pay for my college this semester, which is a big help. I finally understand how people make all those good grades... they study their butts off!  I am still looking for a job after this summer, no clue of what I want to do... (other then weddings if I can get a good camera)

My step mother was in the hospital for 6 days last week. For the past 2 months she has been having off and on fevers and the docs didn't know what was wrong with her. Turns out her appendix had busted... yeah very deadly! But the shocking part is that she has had it for the last 2 months... 2 MONTHS!!! Most people die within 3 days! The doc said it was a miracle! They took what was left of her appendix out and now she is recovering. We arn't in the clear yet... if she gets an infection there isn't much they can do to help. My half bro's are handling it very well (they are 15 and 13 years old), my aunt went to stay there a while and take care of things so my step mom can recover. I am trying to help out by taking my brothers places where we mow lawns on my dads properties. I hope she makes it threw this.... 

Yesterday I got DDR... THAT GAME IS AWESOME! Very hard but FUN! My bro's got it first on xbox and I tried it hehe and decided I wanted it too. I got DDRMAX2 On play station 2 and my pad is for both x box and PS2. I hope our neighbors (down stairs) don't hate us ^_^ anyway thats what is going on right now.

"event","Hey people! *reads friends list* sorry so many of you are having rough times :( Wish I could do more then just comment. This is my fav poem, maybe it will help.

Even This Shall Pass Away 

Once in Persia reigned a King
Who upon his signet ring
Graved a maxim true and wise,
Which, if held before the eyes,
Gave him counsel at a glance,
Fit for every change and chance.
Solemn words, and these are they:
""Even this shall pass away."" 

Trains of camels through the sand
Brought his gems from Samarcand;
Fleets of galleys through the seas
Brought him pearls to match with these.
But he counted not his gain
Treasures of the mine or main;
""What is wealth?"" the king would say;
""Even this shall pass away."" 

In the revels of his court
At the zenith of the sport,
When the palms of all his guests
Burned with clapping at his jests;
He amid his figs and wine,
Cried: ""Oh loving friends of mine!
Pleasure comes but not to stay;
Even this shall pass away."" 

Fighting on a furious field,
Once a javelin pierced his shield;
Soldiers with a loud lament
Bore him bleeding to his tent;
Groaning from his tortured side,
""Pain is hard to bear,"" he cried,
""But with patience, day by day,
Even this shall pass away."" 

Towering in the public square,
Twenty cubits in the air,
Rose his statue, carved in stone,
Then, the king, disguised, unknown,
Stood before his sculptured name
Musing meekly, ""What is fame?
Fame is but a slow decay
Even this shall pass away."" 

Struck with palsy, sere and old,
Waiting at the gates of gold,
Said he with his dying breath;
""Life is done, but what is death?""
Then, in answer to the King,
Fell a sunbeam on his ring,
Showing by a heavenly ray,
""Even this shall pass away."" 


Nothing lasts forever including bad times."

"event","<P>Yay Summer!!! Everything has gotten much better ^_^ . I started my summer day camp job and am having a blast and so far have lost 13 lbs in 4 weeks :) I found out they pay me one dollar more then they did last year so I am making $11 an hour!!! For playing with kids and going swimming and going skating and going to the movies and playing games!!! It's the best job ever! Next Thur. we take the kids to the rangers game all day, never been to a base ball game before ^_^ but it sounds fun! (and i still get paid for it) </P>
<P>I miss you all! I should hang out with you all more, Diana, Sarah, Monica, Alicia, Jenny... all you peoples. Its just hard to find time to do anything other then camp.<BR>I have to find another job for the school year... I cant work at ESD again... that place really put me down, mentally. I hated going there every day and working with people *cough* I didnt like *cough* because *cough* they were moraly *cough* messed up and *cough* cant say more *cough* Lets just say that they think women are the reason for the worlds problems... Yeah once school was over and ""the job"" was over for summer my out look on life got a lot better.</P>
<P>I also learned some stuff about life from that crappy job. You cant always be happy go lucky, sometimes your sad and you just dont know how appreciate stuff... thats how i felt and i couldnt understand why. I never understood why people were unhappy with their lives when they had so much. When something is pulling you down you get tired of fighting and you start to give in. I didnt want to give up, I wanted to be a good person and still be able to stand up for what i thought was right, but its so hard when others (""the job"") are trying to pull you down everyday! Its funny because now its been almost 4 weeks and I have already forgotten most of the stuff they did that bothered me the most, and im glad! I used to think about it all day 24/7 trying to figure out how to help the situation and coming out all frustrated! Its NOT WORTH IT! LIFE IS TOO SHORT! I spent at least 4 months being miserable in that place! I can never get that time back and im not going to give any more! Sorry I know this is confusing. My point is, if your not happy somewhere and you feel like your losing yourself (hopes, dreams, morals) GET OUT! Do what ever you can, you only have one life and your worth being treated with respect! </P>
<P>I am thinking of getting into photography now! I love my new camera soo much! lol and now im looking for a better one now that I know how to do more :). About 2 weeks ago i was the photographer for my friends wedding. I took over 600 pictures and put them on dvd's for her so she could watch them whenever she wanted. I wanted to do it for free but she gave me $120. I am looking into it&nbsp;professionaly... it is a lot of work but its something i might be able to do.</P>

<DIV>About 2 weeks ago while at work at stewarts creek elementry some of the kids in my program came up telling me there were eggs under the slide. I went to check it out and sure enough 2 eggs were under there. Parents abanded them because kids play on the slide all day. So I took them home, keeping them under a light. Through out the last 2 weeks I looked up the eggs, and found they are called killdeer bird eggs. The bird is very pretty and is a kinda water bird. The eggs would take about 30 days to hatch. And it says they are very strong eggs.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>Picture of killdeer bird.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>There is only one way to see if there is a bird inside the eggs... and its called candling. I read how to do it and i made it out of a tissue box. I cut the top out and put a 1 in hole in the bottem. Put the light in the top so i can put the egg over the hole and it kinda lights up the egg. You cant see much but I could see the yuke of the eggs. I wrote on the egges every 3 days to look at their progress.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For the last 6 days I didnt see any progress... yuke hadnt gotten any bigger.. however today one egg when i turned it the yoke moved and i could tell it was floating to the top. The other egg didnt have any sign of changing, I knew it was dead. I didnt know about the second one though and i had this feeling about it.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>The problem was when I found them they were cold... and i didnt know if they had survived or if i had been keeping them at the right temp under my light. Well anyway today was my frist day of work at my full time summer job (day camp) and I had a hard day because I have had a light on to keep the eggs warm all night. I decided that it would be a real hassle to sleep with a light on every night for 2 dead eggs so my mom said to crack the dead one open....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My sister watched and i cracked the first egg (knowing it didnt develop) and sure enough the inside was like a chicken egg, just a youk. It was dead when i found it. I looked at the second one and held it, I said to my sister ""I dont know about this one, it could be alive i cant tell."" I put it back and thought I better wait... but then I though of the light being on for another 3 days right in my eyes. I said I guess this one is dead too and my sister said go ahead you know they were both dead.</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I cracked it and blood squrted out... I couldnt belive it. I started to cry and my mom came in saying no no it just developed faster and she took the shell apart to reveal a little embryo looking creature. She picked it up and I could see a little head with eyes devoloping and little body with wings and little legs. I KILLED IT! My mom said that it was dead and had already been like that when I found it.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>She told me to look it up and I did. I found that eggs that are about 11 days old develop embryo's and the diagrams looked just like the one&amp;nbsp;I killed. I wish I could go back in time and just trust my gut feeling. I KNEW IT WAS ALIVE I KNEW IT AND I KILLED IT!!! All that time of taking care of eggs! 14 nights of sleeping with a light in my eyes and today i give up! WHY!?!?!?! I could have saved a baby bird BUT NO! I THOUGHT OF MYSELF!!! Oh I am mad am so mad at me!</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I know the odds of it living are very slim even after it hatches... but it had hope as long as&amp;nbsp;I had faith. I learned a valuble lesson from this little egg, dont give up on life no matter how hopeless it seems. If there is even the smallest chance, help it grow and never give up.<BR>I used to say I have no regrets... but now i do, I regret not trusting myself. I am sorry little bird.<BR></DIV>"

"event","Hey cool DUDES!!! Hehehe im a dork. Anyway I sprained my ankle yesterday at work by falling down some stairs. WEEEE It was so puffy last night my mom took me to the ER to get it x rayed we left at 10 and got back at 2am! We just wanted to make sure it wasn't fractured or something, but its all puffy and swollen and it hurts to move it. Other then that I'm all good! Looking forward to the weekend! hehe The doc gave me a absent from school thing for the next 3 days hehe. To bad I don't have school for the next 3 days fri, sat, sun. Oh well I still get to miss work for a day WOO HOO!

Hey you guys ever play RUNESCAPE!!! Its an awesome game, made of java. And guess what!?!?! ITS FREE!!! I like it because you get to be knits running around and you get armor and there are tons of quests to do. I have been playing for the last 3 years so my character is really good. I can help anyone out if they wanna start playing. The graphics aren't bad, they used to be but they did this HUGE update that took 2 years to do and now its all cool looking. Hehe. Warning though, if you start its hard to stop, very easy to get obsessed. I play it and so does my evil sister and my 2 half brothers. Let me know if anyone wants to play!

HAVE A GOOD DAY!!!! LORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS!"

So much to look forward to, hehe I know that I have lots to do also, but it doesn't bother me. Harry Potter movie coming out, Lord of the rings coming to dvd. They wanted me back at my summer camp job.  Why is life so wonderful?"

During the first part of the party we watched this very funny yet stupid show called Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter. Oh, and Diana, I'm sorry I didn't spend much time with you there :( your NOT worthless no mater what you say! NO ONE IS WORTHLESS!!! Your a great friend and you can do anything you put your mind to! Your fun to be around too, I was upstairs laughing with people who were trying to sleep, I didn't mean to not hang with you. Thanks for Friday, I had a great time visiting you at your dorm, I hope to do it again soon... that is if you forgive me ^_^

I had a great time laughing with Jenny, Nick, Ray, Sarah, Drew, and Joel while they all tried to sleep. Especially the ghost stories that was hilarious! Thanks for all the laughs! Wish Monica could have come wasn't the same without you. I will put the pictures up soon... I won't put up any that I think might offend people, if one does offend you let me know and I will edit it alright?
Thanks again for all the fun Logan, Clayton, Tyler, Diana, Sarah, Drew, Joel, Nick, Ray, Steven, Cat, Cosmic, Jenny, Alicia, Sam, Carrie, and anyone I forgot! ^_^"

With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
No, no, no
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot
Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT
I don't care about spots on my apples,
Leave me the birds and the bees
Please

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

Why not?

Listen, late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took my girl away
Don't it always seem to go

Well, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

Why not?

Why you wanna give it
Why you wanna giving it all away
Hey, hey, hey
Now you wanna give it
I should wanna give it
Now you wanna giving it all away

Hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot

You know, this song makes me think. Scary.. I know.. ""thinking"" hehe. The part where it says ""you don't know what you got 'til it's gone"". Its so true, we always look at what we lost, or want, or don't have and hardly ever focus on what actually we have. I mean I know some may think I don't have much, but you know what??? I'm proud of all I have, including myself! I mean we take the smallest things for granted. I don't like my nose, but I have one and I can breath without a machine! I don't like the color of my eyes but, I can see! I think I'm ugly but, at least I have a body that functions, I can walk, I can do things like a normal person! There are people out there who are paralyzed, who have no legs, or arms! I mean I can WALK!!! Do you know how lucky we are to just WALK??? Oh my gosh I'm so happy! What if I couldn't do something I can do now, like hear or see or stand, ""you don't know what you got tell its gone"", its so true! I have friends (yeah YOU!) GREAT FRIENDS!!!! I have a computer!!! I have a family! My mom is my best friend she is always there to listen and care!!! I HAVE LORD OF THE RINGS!!! I'm glad for what I have! There are people out there in the world dieing right now! Car crash, cancer, gunshot, Aids, starvation, old age, suicide... RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND!  As you read this someone is dieing, they are losing their life. I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE! Some kids don't even make it to 10, and I have had 19 wonderful years! I'M THE HAPPIEST PERSON ALIVE JUST TO BE ALIVE!"

"event","I GIVE UP! AHHHH! I was trying to make some South Park sugar cookies for Logan and Clayton's Birthday party however a few things went wrong and I quit! This is how it went.... 

   Ok last new year, I went to my dads house and my 14 year old brother helped me make some south park sugar cookies, wasn't that hard! We shaped them into south park characters and baked them, then with food coloring and cake frosting we would give them color, they looked really good and tasted great! So I thought humm bet it would be great to bring them to Logan and Clayton's B-day party. So today I went to Wal-Mart, and got some ingredients, I remembered in my Co op class in High school we used wax paper so I got some, thinking it would help keep the cookies from sticking... So I got home, DOUBLED the ingredients. The dough looked and tasted just right, after adding almost half a cup of extra sugar. So I started to shape out the characters, you know some Kenny's and some Cartmans, and maybe a Mr. Hanky and so I cooked them, well they weren't cooked enough after 7 min so I put them back and put in another batch waiting for them to cook, wellll.... before the alarm went off I noticed some SMOKE coming from the oven so ran over turned it off and... yeah.. burnt the cookies. My mom tried to make the best of it by saying they aren't THAT bad, lol got to love my mom... So anyway turns out the wax paper did something and like melted or something so, lost two batches of cookies there. *Cough* Lord of the rings ROcKS! *Cough*  

   After getting rid of that stupid wax paper, I started on my third batch, made them smaller so they would cook better, placed them in the oven, 7 min and they looked good, but not cooked all the way, sooo I put them back and checked on them every 2 min... after about 15 min they weren't cooked well enough... My mom came in and went and checked all my ingredients and asked if I added stuff or not and well I did it all right. So I turned up the oven and put in another batch after another 7 min I took them both out and the new batch wasn't even warm!!! That's when I realized... I FORGOT TO TURN THE OVEN BACK ON!!!! I turned off the part where you switch it to bake when I smoked the first batch!!! AHHHH! 
   
   So I laughed with my mom and I started preheating the oven again... Put the cookies back in... cooked for 7 min AND BURNT THEM!!! 2 more batches!!! And these aren't just any sugar cookies, you have to shape and cut each one by hand, and draw in the faces it's allot of work to just burn... AAHHHHHH!!! 4 BATCHES AHHHHH!!! So I QUIT!

When I was working at Morningside Elementary School about a year ago, and the next Harry Potter movie was coming out so I put up a Harry Potter poster on the cafeteria bulletin bored, well the next day the principle told me I had to take it down because parents were complaining it was teaching their children witchcraft. WITCHCRAFT?!?! IT WAS A POSTER!!! AHHHHH! And all the Harry Potter books were in the school library!!! Some teachers were really mad about it too, they were on my side. BUT NOOOO! We can have pictures of Christmas and Easter but, NOOO NOT Harry Potter! GRRRR! Oh well, they will get their come-up-ens KARMA WILL FIND A WAY ... Mwahahahaha! ^_~

"event","I think you should read this. It might help you to find someone to love like... YOURSELF! I'm tired of people afraid to be themselves!

I don't understand why society puts all this emphasis in having a boy friend or girl friend all the time... there is nothing wrong with being on your own. I mean you have only a few years to be single. This is the time in our life to be free, the time where we can explore the world and, figure out who YOU really are. I'm not saying people shouldn't date, I just think that we shouldn't go around thinking we are worthless for not having a boyfriend or girlfriend. Because I can tell you right now, if your only wanting a partner because you don't feel whole without one then your not looking for love. 

You need to love yourself before you can love another! If you cant love yourself you wont have a meaningful relationship. To find yourself you have to learn from living. NO ONE is worthless! What you think about yourself determines your worth, not what someone else thinks about you. You wont be who you want to be until you believe it. You have to know who you are for people to love you for who you are. Am I getting through? If you go around thinking ""I'm a bad person, I am worth more dead then alive, I'm ugly, stupid, fat, worthless!"", your becoming a bitter person. Is that what you see in people when you first meet them? That they are worthless or ugly or stupid? Hope not! Then why do  it to yourself? Your a person too! You have as much a right to be here as anyone! *cough*lord of the rings rocks*cough*

Want to know why I don't read ""teen"" magazines or watch ""teen"" shows? They make you think that to be happy you have to have a sexual relationship. Because sex sells! Its everywhere! There is a big difference between having sex and making love. Sex is only a physical experience, making love is a deeper relationship between two people. You wont have the love making until you know yourself. In other words don't be with someone because of peer pressure, or to keep them happy, do it because you want to. (Yeah, I know normally I wouldn't talk about this stuff but, I grew up and know it's a part of life)

You don't need to be tied in a relationship. It's etched in your brain that your not complete unless you have someone. That's B.S. be yourself, be your own person! And someone will find you, and they will like you for being you. No one is ever perfect for each other, relationships require work or it wont last. You have to know yourself to make it meaningful and keep it that way. Even then your heart has to be in the right place. If you think a relationship is a cure for happiness your wrong, like I said before only you can make yourself happy. The next time someone asks if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend stand up and say ""HELL NO! AND I'M IN NO HURRY!"" Give yourself time to grow. There are plenty of fish in the sea and lots of time to go fishing. When your stuck in a relationship your stuck! EXPERIMENT, LEARN, HAVE FUN, BE SAFE! LIVE LIFE NOW!

Hope this helps you make decisions in your life, I aimed at allot of people. I thank my mom because she raised me this way, and helped me put this into words. Oh and LORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS! Written By: Sophia Sadeghian hobbit_lotr"

"event","<P><FONT size=2>This is my first attempt to actually entering something meaningful that I would write in my diary. Sorry its so long, this is the kinda stuff I think of all the time. Sorry if this bothers anyone, I have allot of ideas that people think are crazy. Hehe maybe&nbsp;I am after all&nbsp;I'm agnostic, which means I believe everything is possible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>On Christmas day we (mother, sis and I) went to see Peter pan, because we had nothing better to do. Well the movie was O.K. could have been better but, I enjoyed it. However the story line obviously had holes in it. So I looked up the novel and read it. I really enjoyed it. To my surprise it had lots of unexpected and hidden meaning. For example, the author based loads of the stories from his own life (I read the afterward) Like the author was born in a large family and was the youngest, they all depended on the oldest brother to bring them money however he died in some sudden accident and that's why in peter pan there are lost boys, its the dead children. His brother died at 13 so he was still a kid. The lost boys were saved by peter, in the novel it said peter would find children's souls and take them half the way to heaven. Interesting .... Did you know that the ticking crocodile that's running after hook symbolizes how time kills. That's why hook fears it, he fears his death coming for him. Peter is not afraid of the croc. Peter Pan represents youth, and when your young you believe anything. Whenever Peter pretends something it becomes real in never land. I find that funny because if you think about it, our realities are just that, what we believe or want to believe. Kinda like Shallow hal the movie. Maybe we have the ability to make our own realities, like in dreams but don't know how to do it quite right. I mean everything we see or feel is made of little impulses of energy in our brains. Tiny little atoms moving really fast. I like the flying part because... when you grow up its not that you cant fly, its because you forgot how, the world of a child is overtaken by reason. You can never be a child again, and its kind of sad now that I think about it. I mean the child your parents and friends once knew is dead, but yet still alive it just evolved into something else. If I ever met a younger me... would it still be me? No, it wouldn't, I would be almost the complete opposite, not any better or worse.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>""Pebbles on the shore- I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a prettier shell or a smother pebble than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."" - Isaac Newton</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Maybe we are some made up dream, from some creature on another planet. Maybe we are all dreaming and they are all just connected. That's another thing I noticed in Peter pan the novel. Dreams were considered actual adventures. Why not? Why do we draw lines between what we consider real or not. If in a dream you travel the world and see all these sights and do all kind of things, how is that any different from acutely doing them in your mental reality. In the end your still left with only memories. You know what I mean? Say I dreamt I sky dived, and woke up with that feeling of falling. How is that different from feeling it in this reality? I get the same feeling in my mind. Dreams do so much for us, its like a reminder that there is allot we don't understand. Especially the shocking dreams, like the ones where you die. Dreams come from a world we haven't found a way to control. Wow, never thought of it before... I'm talking about the state of mind we have made for ourselves. Maybe our dreams didn't just happen in our minds, maybe they happen in another dimension. We try to get logic from our dreams, but our logic was made for this reality. It's almost like trying to imagine what a person who has been blind since birth thinks seeing is. Or what a deaf person thinks of hearing. Could you imagine being able to make sense of vibrations in the air? Guess we have a hard time imagining, we have never felt. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Heh, I could go on forever, but my fingers are starting to hurt... Ever wander why they gave Hook a hook? Its because the author had arthritis in his right hand and it would freeze up, sometimes into the shape of a hook.</FONT></P>"

<P>Written by: <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/stardust_faerie/"">stardust_faerie</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;<EM>I'm getting scared. Adam's constant buying is really making me scared. I know that my dad is already in debt because of the house repairs and rennovations. Adam is much less restrained about it than he used to be. It's now to where nearly every day, he's buying something new. I have no idea what he's buying. Mostly things online. But packages keep coming to the door. UPS people... all the time, all the time. I swear it's going to drive me crazy. My parents can't do anything about it. If they refuse to buy something for him then he argues and argures and argues, he fights them and fights them.....he wouldn't ever stop. They'd eventually have to call the police if they ever let it get that far. Then his parole officer and courts would have to get involved....my parents don't want that. It would lengthen his sentences. So they just give in instead.....I'm not saying that this is better. I'm just saying that there's really nothing that they can do. And it only makes him worse. I just want it to stop. I JUST WANT IT TO STOP. I don't want my dad to go any further into debt. I don't want anything bad to happen. Adam is such a liar, such a manipulator. He'll stop at nothing. He has no friends so he'll do anything for that ""good feeling"" you have when you get something new.</EM></P>
<P> Here is my comment ^_^ :</P>
<P>Wow, that's not fair at all... Here is a quote u might like. I got it from Leaves of gold, its called Over Equipped: </P>
<P>""Parents spend huge sums of money on the clothing of their children, their external manners and appearance and in preparing the positions in life which they are to occupy. But like as not the poor youths will rattle around in it all day like dry peas in a pod. The finest equipment is sometimes only a handicap."" (anonyms) </P>
<P>This was published before the 1930's so you kinda have to switch the proper manners and stuff with video games and stuff. I can see how your parents don't want to mess with all the legal court stuff. However, sometimes that's what it takes. You know what I mean? If they don't fix it now, when they have the control it will only get worse like you fear. Also I think your brother needs to learn more ""good feelings"" for example, the feeling of buying something you have waited on because you had to save up your hard earned money. Or the feeling of appreciation, understanding that there are people less fortunate then himself, and that in less then a second he could be one of them.&nbsp;</P>
<P>My mom told me that if you want to change someone's behavior you must first change yours. Its allot harder said then done. I think if your parents took away his video games and privileges he would eventually straiten up. But, because of all the ""giving in"" in the past they have made a more difficult situation. They will have to want him to change. If they don't see a problem then nothing will ever happen. Your family needs to go to family counseling. I think your the only one who wants the change bad enough to do something about it. Your parents must change their role from being manipulated to manipulating your brother into behaving.</P>
<P>Its obvious you love your parents and want to help them, your parents need to see that they have the control. They also need to realize that they have a loving daughter&nbsp;who is behind them all the way.&nbsp;I guess the only&nbsp;thing you can do is try to&nbsp;convince your parents&nbsp;that they have the power.&nbsp;If they weren't there your brother would not be able to argue until he got his way. If your parents love your brother enough they will ""see"" and do something to help him. Diana, I feel sorry for you, how could someone as wonderful as you have a problem such as this...</P>"

"event","I should be writing something worthwhile right now, but I've written a poem on writer's block in the past, and given that it was crappy then, I hesitate to revisit the subject and find it has not improved.  My writing is virtually non-existent.  I think this is the first time in a few months I have connected three sentences with a unifying idea, aside from a few scribblings of frustration written in longhand.  Why it has become difficult for me is beyond me.  Likely it is because there is nothing that comes of it.  I have little desire to have my work read by others, and have all but abandoned ideas of grandeur in the publishing world.  Life will continue whether I write or not, so I simply am choosing the path of least resistance.  And I've never felt the ""need to write"" that so many people talk about.  Never have I had an idea where I just had to get it on paper or I would explode.  Sure, there's been a couple times when I've written down a bit of inspiration and thought to myself ""right on, that's solid and I feel okay now,"" but nothing comes of those moments, and when I don't put a pen in my hand to catch the idea, there is no consequence.  Well, save for the lack of any progress in the field and fewer and fewer pitches coming my way.
The worst part is that next weekend is my favorite time to read my poetry - Oktoberfest poetry slam.  Just a bunch of family and friends gathered to eat, drink, read poetry, and be merry.  They are always supportive and it is fun to produce a decent poem for the event, but it is tough to face that crowd who believed that I was going to do this for my life, that poetry was my art and passion.  How do you face those people and say, ""Nope, it's not.""  Perhaps I will try to put something together over the course of the week, just to make sure it hasn't escaped me completely.  Maybe it won't even be that cynical.

Remember the words of Eligh, ""Poetry doesn't have to do anything at all."""

"event","The word depression has penetrated the social consciousness to the point that I can no longer empathize with those afflicted by the disease.  Today I feel depressed.  Yesterday and the day before, too.  How long have I been feeling this melancholy?  I know the fixes for moments of loneliness, but won't do them.  They are too hard today and everyday.  When I feel good they're easy, but they are so less necessary.  Now as my torso is tied to a rope and the whirlpool I'm standing in twists my legs in circles, I cannot pickup the phone and talk to someone.  How could I call an old friend and begin a conversation with ""I feel like shit"".  Fuck cliches, too.  I do feel like shit right now, there is no other term for it.  My eyes are welled and burning with a pressure that is waiting to explode, my chest is taut and shaky.  But I can't breakdown, either.  I don't want the fucking pity of anyone, I just want to feel better.  I want to be myself, looking at the world in a way that makes me know it's all going to be okay, or at least it won't be as terrible as the sum of the parts would lead a mind to assume.  Dread hangs around my shoulders as they ache from living, from nothing more than the daily motion of lifting my arms.  I want time off from that, from everything.  Just pause the world for a few timeless days and I'll get better, I swear.  Escape is a promise that dwells just beyond the horizon - there must be something over it that is better than here; anonymity is paradise but loneliness is the daily meal."

"event","A few days without reading a good book and I feel like shit.  I miss that constant intellectual companionship found so rarely in life, and only found consistently, but in ever morphing quality, in books.  My drive to escape the harsh reality of life, not to mention the stark loneliness of the universe, drives me into a book's beginning, but as soon as the author has revealed a few single secrets, I want out.  There must be fifty books with markers fifty pages in on my shelf.  It must be the fear of realizing something that is too true or honest, something that I'd rather not know and only speculate about.

"event","What do they expect from us?  We can't be everywhere at once, make all the right decisions, stay up at their pleasure, cry in our privacy, and still eat a healthy dinner.  Sick of it all.  Box living never felt so confining, but outside the box is only ambiguity and hatred.  Smile at a stranger and get asked for a nickel.  Give it too quickly, and suddenly it's bus fare that's needed.  Stories and lies roll off our tongues to appease the packs we roll with.  Curse this consciousness that plagues existence with despair, scuffs up intent until it becomes a weak jab into a bag of rice.  I don't want to follow through anymore, I like not finishing books.  Fuck the ending, it's the journey that counts.  Happy to harp on that riff but unwilling to accept the practice.  Sunny days make me smile, still, but I'm still too tired to care because it keeps me up and wakes me early.  Imagine Alaskan summers.  What's so great about a picture of someone?  If my hair is messy or straight does that tell you if I beat my dog?  Can you tell my moral stance on murder by the posture I maintain?  I don't have pictures of myself, and those I do have I am ashamed of because I had to take them my damn self.  Any other involves me in uncomfortable social situations trying to avoid a limelight while avoiding the stigma of avoidance.  Because I choose to not take pictures but look at the world not through a momentary framed occurence but as a whole, I am somehow less than others.

Even those of us lonely and looking for a little life in our nothing day will quickly, often gladly, shut the door on a neighbor to retreat to the comfort of routine, of nothing.  The most minute interaction with a passerby may be the one that awakens life.  What if you passed Dr. King on the street and didn't say hello?  How many chances to you think you get to become a nice person?  What we do today, we do the rest of our lives on this day, and to waste it without building or creating is to approach death with the assurance it will be the end of you.  Eternity holds the great markers of great people, people who wrote every day to produce one story that is the staple of childrens' tales everywhere.  A great idea resides beside us all, and combined with our own powers, that idea has the potential to shift the world into an awareness unknown prior.  Imagine the greatest challenge facing the world and solve it, then apply it.  Or, do as they want you to do and do nothing.  That's what I'll be doing, I'm sure.  Coasting through another day, awaiting the end like waiting for the bus.  This life is nothing but a block's walk from the stop - eyes down, don't step on the cracks or outside the lines."

"event","How often I look at myself and say, ""what have you done today?""  The question is powerful, but I still cannot answer with honesty, and it is that that leaves me feeling unfulfilled.  All my goals, my ideals, my visions for the future, are routinely dismissed as I strive to be no more than I was when I awoke some fourteen hours ago.  Still, I cling to a notion that I deserve so much more than I currently have, yet I do nothing to earn the plethora I already possess.  I do not want to be a working stiff.  Avoiding this fate that dangles before me, trying to pull the strings of my life tauter with each passing day, requires that I take some iniative, do something that means something.  Something!  I swallow my frustrations and anxiety into my stomach and focus on simple goods to feel accomplished - do I have something for dinner?  do I have books and a guitar (even if I don't use either enough to justify them)?   Two accomplishments have I completed this week: one, got my car back on the road, two, gave blood.  These are nothing!  I sit inside my dreary box and wonder why my mind is vapid as I read about the terrors happening everywhere in the world, the world outside me.  It's as though if I never bother to expose myself to anything jarring I will be able to forever exist removed from pain.  This mentality is self-defeating, though, as I sit with myself and read the wisdom of ages that directly contradicts my mindset.  Each minute that passes is another minute that I haven't seized control of my life.

I'd like to join the peace corp.  I'm sick of looking at options and deciding against them for some abstract reason or some other person's advice.  While it would be appealing to hunt for a job that involves writing in some way, I simply do not believe enough in myself to accomplish this.  Just read that akward phrasing and say otherwise.  I do not have the knowledge to step out on my own; my drive is not great enough.  The peace corp is tempting because it offers a chance to take some initiative in the world and do good, but it is also a pen and paper commitment - there is no escaping it.  I surely cannot get out of my routines without some outside help at this point.  For too many days in a row I've not accomplished a thing, only wasted hours ducking responsibility in the maze of exaggerated convictions that is the internet or mushed my brain into stew staring at the same television shows repeated endlessly, sucking down food with no intention of cleaning the kitchen or dishes.  My bathroom is messy.  Why didn't I clean it today?  Because I have convinced myself that I didn't want to, that I had other things to do, and look at me now.  Another day is gone and I'm no closer to anything significant - an hour from bed and still no dinner.

When I awoke today, I sprang from bed with vigor, energized because I knew it was Friday, payday, and I had the weekend ahead of me with promises of books and reflection, socializing and smiles.  Today is Thursday.  Will I be able to summon the same energy tomorrow, Friday?  For so many reasons, I doubt it.  But for so many reasons, many the same, I pray that I can.  Tomorrow is another day.  Everyday is a Saturday no more, but everyday is mine still."

"event","It is too easy to sit back and be content.  I hesitate to say happy because it is hard to consider happiness to be prevalent these days, but contentment is abundant.  After 8 hours of work plus an hour or two for communting, who has time to read and comprehend, let alone act?  Thus, when confronted with ideas and facts that completely annihilate everything that is a factor in creating contentment, the average person will shutter at the idea, let it bounce off their minds for fear of having their world threatened.  This seems a normal reaction, but it is also unacceptable.  The corruption in our government is so prevalent and the manipulation so automatic that we cannot be allowed to hold ourselves back.  By succumbing to the world of work and spend, we are tallying another point up for the status quo, and I, for one, would rather steer away from the 300 year course of this nation's past, littered with the corpses of innocent civilians, peaceful nations, and noble ideals.  A simple look at economics should be enough to invigorate any rational person.  We consider ourselves a peaceful, civilized nation yet we feed war machines with billions of dollars a week, creating a false economy that needs constant conflict to survive.  Politicians are able to vote their own pay raises, deeming it unnecessary for them to fight for any sort of fundamental change in health care, food and water supply, adequate housing, etc.  They, in turn, shuffle power to corporations who are able to control the populus via television, creating an image of ""successful"" people made so by their investments and purchases.  There is no motivation for alteration of this trend, except in the people.  This is, of course, why revolution has always and must always begin with the people, not necessarily from the bottom up, but from the informed outward.  But it is absolutely pertinent that the common worker shrug off the imposed needs that our economy is based upon, the need for a new car, the need for a new tv, the need for a bigger house, the need for new clothes.  As a working class, we must stop supporting this false economy and begin saving capital with which it will be possible to support one another as the consumer cultural is halted.  Slowly, companies will die off, but they will be companies founded on outdated principles of a spend-happy consumer class, not based on the needs of a working class.  Slowly, we will build an economy that strives to provide meaningful work to people in exchange for a healthy life.  Slowly, we will take this country from those who now control it, and expand upon the founding principles of pursuing true happiness not through material possession and limitless greed, but through social interaction and beneficial livelihoods.  To begin, we must stop listening to the lies and seize the power we have."

"event","Someone once asked me as I poured a beer into a glass mug, ""why would you remove it from its frosty native environment?""  It's a good question, and one that has stuck with me.  I've often considered it as I sip a delicious import or microbrew from a chilled bottle, wondered to myself how it would taste in a glass.  The main variance that I can think would be a detriment is the temperature.  Thus, it is necessary to have a chilled glass handy and several more in the freezer.  These days, I prefer 8 oz pilsner glasses as they control the head well while still allowing a built to build up.  They also control the portions.  Back to my friend's comment and my rational for the removal.  If drinking a quality beer, sure, it is nice to see the label looking back into your eyes.  But, as is often the case, a Rainier is my beer of choice.  As such, it is nice to pour it into a glass (a tallcan fits nicely into two separate pourings - keep glasses in queue) to lend it a touch of significance.  Once poured, it is difficult to tell the difference between said beer and any reputable pale ale out there, save for the taste.  However, the glass also enhances that aspect, providing a distinguishing touch and an icy refreshment that is always welcome."

The mornings move quicker than they ever have before, and the afternoons are short and sweet.  My time is occupied, even if I dawdle, and slivers hardly slow me down anymore, demanding a wince immediately and more attention later.  I watch as my hands slide within millimeters of the saw blade, so sharp it leaves marks between the base of fingers when its lifted and carried, but I don't fret.  My mind imagines my knuckles slipping from the jigs, colliding with the shaper's head and gnawing away the bone - this is why it doesn't happen.  Before my eyes, lines and measurements form cabinets and counters, fins derivatives of faces.  I can no longer operate touch screen devices with the tips of my fingers as they feature a thin, irremovable layer of poly that slides over everything, there's a film on everything, as though nothing is ever touched but skimmed.  A millimeter is .03937 inches.

There seems to be towers growing from the fog.  I have never noticed the abundance of clocks and steeples protruding from the low-lying concrete of this city.  But with the hillside covered in a sliding cloud with blue glimmering beyond, the dark elongated triangles have appeared, the first to see the rewards of a misty morning.  I've always imagined that the towers in Siena spoke above the other still covered buildings, trading stories of peaceful days where the town stayed shrouded dawn to night and people were only imagined in some other place, out of mind.  Could this happen here, in the midst of freeways' roars and foremen's persistence?  The cranes must envy the established stones, only tasting the life above the cloud for short stints before being disassembled and stored.  In the yards of steel they reminisce of jobs completed that treated them to long stays.  As the rains rust their corners and the young beams complain, the elders smile and remember delays caused by the same water, but you can't share that kind of wisdom so they keep quiet - the young will learn for themselves."

"event","I played my guitar for a few hours today, until I realized what makes a good guitar player.  I am able to do anything that I can read in music, but it's being able to do it well that is challenging.  Practice is all that matters.  I can play a million chords but until I see them arranged in the way Alice in Chains plays them, I stand no chance.  Once I figured out how much talent it takes to write the music, I lost my urge to play.  Hmm, I suppose that's the same justification for the music industry's attack of tablature.  Still ridiculous, but illuminating to understand both sides of argument even if one is preposterous.
How can a Newsweek article contain, in one sentence, the words ""violently,"" ""forcefully,"" and ""aggresively?""  (inside the quotes or out?)  Adverbs mean nothing anyway, and using three that mean the exact same thing (the precise quote would show this) makes a weak point weaker.  I read it a few times trying to figure out how I would change it, but the sentence was just terrible and should never have passed the editor's desk.  That publication has really slipped as of late.  Of course, I'm just bitter because Fareed Zakaria's column appears sporadically and the other, conservative leaning commentators have been given more range.  If I wanted to read a broad sampling of semi-news, I'd pick up Time.  I want NEWS that happened this WEEK.  I do not consider half a paragraph about a new luxury car news.  Nor do celebrities deserve a page in any reputable, fact bearing magazine.  I can handle the 12 page spread on menopause, it's necessary to cover the bases of readership and too much about the war is just boring.  But I found nothing on the senate or house that was below the surface, not a single article about Africa or Southeast Asia, and only a brief tidbit about Iran and Venezuela forging a stronger tie (which was strongly pro-west and gave little more than an opinion on the subject).  Bah.  All news is terrible these days.  Even Al-jazeera's english broadcast resembles the bbc, which more and more is resembling cnn, which more and more is identical to fox news.  Painful.
I like the idea of changing my corner of the earth by changing my life, but these days it doesn't seem like that's enough.

Down a dark hallway, my fingers slide over smooth walls and flush doors without jambs, their brass knobs catching a glint of light that pierces through mist.  Offset, they come on the left, then the right, then left again.  The white lines beneath the doors gleen brighter on the knobs as the angle approaches zero, then fade.  Skip the doors.  Fingertips are calloused, insensitive, they float over the surfaces and cold feels normal, hot feels fine.  Skip the unknown, stick to what's planned ahead.  The mist intensifies as the hall widens, like walking down the neck of an uncorked champagne bottle, a haze floating that is pushed only by carbonation, slinking around my shoulders and down my back.  I can touch only one wall at a time.  I bounce between them, afraid to leave the comfort of confinement.  One more step and they're gone, flared outward into the dark.  The light is gone, the fog kills noise.  Open eyes see no shapes.  No more doors but many more steps."

Well, I suppose that rush is pretty standard as well, so all that's really changed is my bank account balance.  I did get to hang out with Leanna for a bit, which is nice since I tend to shy away from people I don't know too well or feel awkward around.  Which is essentially anyone these days.
Why am I alone tonight?  Let me count the reasons.  My girlfriend lives, for all practical purposes, on the other side of the planet, only gracing me with her presence on the rarest of occasions.  This is largely due to my unbecoming ways, but the isolation is still acute.  In fact, seeing her tomorrow is what my entire week has revolved around-so excited, so anxious, so nervous.  My friends seem to believe that Seattle, Tacoma's big brother, holds the key to happiness in the form of stumbly nights in the freezing Fremont streets and mornings accented by the lumps in couches.  Blah, I've ranted on that before.  My parents would, I'm sure, love to see me, but I simply can't bring myself to show up there.  Not that I'm avoiding it or anything, it's just so depressing to ""hang out"" with my parents, and even there it's a bit weird.  Now that I try to classify myself as moved out, I feel like a third wheel on a bicycle - by definition I should not be there.  My estranged friends, those I only occasionally come across, are likely willing to do something, but again I cannot call them and suggest an endeavor because I've lost (did I ever have?) my interest in being interesting.  I could care less if people are uncomfortable with silence, I enjoy just sitting with people and listening to the world.  Indeed, that is by far my favorite past time in bars, just being in the presence of others.  Is this odd?  I think that a large portion of those I'm in the presence of would argue for the affirmative, and I think that my enjoying the activity does little to impress people with any of my intractable qualities, save my introvertedness.
Well, I guess there's only one other person to blame, but do I dare to put it into words, where it gains the force of generations, eternally mocking me from halfway down a slowly filling page, reminding me that once I recognized a weakness and still chose to ignore it?  Fuck it.  I'd rather sit around and have a few beers, maybe watch something on the idiot box (a fantastic cliche) or strum a few chords.  Who really cares anyway?  Is anyone out there doing something so amazing that I would look and say, ""wow, wish I was doing that""?  I don't think so.  I hope not, at least."

It is a culmination of the great aspects of music, from the intensity in a vibrating high note hit with just the right chest bursting feeling of expectancy and restraint, to the improvisation of many players reading each other and feeling the beat above all else even as they dance around it.

The radio today had commercials, repeatedly, about getting all over that new years resolution to achieve healthy skin via botox or knives or some other superficial crap (the laser hair removal is still one of the announcer's favorites).

The answer may be too long to be any real comfort for me today, but I sure appreciate the question.  Not the question itself (which is painfully cliche and simple) but my ability to ask it, because if I were unable to ask the question it means that whatever I am referring to has already been abandoned.  I'll stick with the indecision for now.
Perhaps the point of life is to avoid asking why we're here and simply enjoying it while it lasts.  I look around me and see friends who strive to fill their time with booze and sitting.  Not just doing it, but actually striving to do it, waking in the morning with the prominent idea being ""do I have any beer left from last night?""  How can this be?  I woke this morning and my mind was dominated with only one thought (beyond the beautiful girl lying beside me) - breakfast.  All I wanted to do was enjoy the day off and cook a substantial breakfast since that is something that I miss out on five days a week.  And, oh, the joy of munching on sausage compared to shredded wheat is truly one for the ages.  If I can pass one idea on to my children it will be a love of food, although loving sausage may not be the best example.  After that, I began to think of ways to fill my day.  I thought of playing the guitar, messing around with linux, taking pictures in the park, napping, watching a movie, and tons of other little things, but I certainly was not fixated on drinking.  Is this only because I have not experienced that many amazing times with alcohol?  Or is it because I can still think of other things to do?  I must admit, though, that it did cross my mind to joke about having a beer with breakfast, and then when I was cooking I thought of how easy it would be to crack one there in the kitchen.  What a slippery slope that could become, though, and how I would hate to slide down that hill.  Dangerous and ugly and so many other things.  It's important to always have juice in the fridge, or milk, or at least a can of pop to kill a craving for refreshment.
Sometimes it's difficult to believe that the universe is real at all.  Right now, there are people all over the world fighting, praying, walking, talking, eating, singing, writing, painting, playing board games, looking into another's eyes, crashing a car, flicking a speck of dirt, and on and on.  It is really tough to look beyond my own sphere to imagine those people.

The workweek is dreadful.  While the morning pasted quickly and I did enjoy the tasks I completed, or at progressed, I can't help but wish it was once again the weekend.  Five days of early rising and dust filled nostrils for two days of exhausted running around.  I peeked through a bit of Animal Farm this morning (on the lookout for a good cat name) and was caught by a speech at the very beginning that defines the enemy as man.  Verbatim: we have all that we could possibly need around us to live in luxury and ease, yet the exploitation of our labor by men has forced us into subservience.  Man is the only creature who adds nothing but takes so, so much.

I now see a large problem with my friend base that has never occurred to me before, and that is that they sleep different hours than I.  Working during the week and rising at 6 has forced me to almost mimic the action on the weekends, sometimes possibly stretching it to 7 at the most.  This leaves me with a plethora of time before I can even think to call friends to play music, tour the city, or play some vids.  I wouldn't dare to call most of my friends before eleven, and most before noon, for fear of waking them.  Not that I am afraid of the repurcussion, but rather that it would reveal my limited activity of the night before, having not stayed up till four and thus not needing to sleep the day away.

"event","How d'you like that, almost exactly a year later and I haven't missed a beat.  Changes come in many forms but I feel like they've only come and gone, and reading over my feelings from a year ago, I get a sense that all that's changed is one number.  5 to a 6, 2 to a 3.

Oh well!

The rain clouds in the forecast are a dreary reminder of the season, and the three day looks no better, only adding more clouds for the addition of a day.  Whoopee.  Payday will be nice, I suppose, at least to beef up the ol' rent-drained checking account.  Be nice to buy a beer or a bottle, too.  Hell, I may even treat myself to a pint at the local bar come Monday.  Can't miss the Seahawks, after all, for if I did who knows what might happen.  North Korea could send a nuke over the water (I guess that's a new thing, too) and I'd have not seen the game, or Bush could be assassinated and the papers would devote their time to covering that, leaving me in the dark as to whether Alexander played well or not.  Woe is me if I miss the game!"

They reach up from down deep in my americanism and just barely nip against the bottom of my brain, mixing in their toxic juice enough to alter a few proteins.  Then I see myself, doing something I don't need to be doing but I'm addicted to - drinking coffee, downloading drivel - and it's painful."

"event","I don't usually enjoy waiting in line at a grocery store.  It's demeaning and uninspiring.  All around are people in a hurry to get all their groceries and get through that seven foot stretch before they lose their minds.  To make it worse, stores have begun to realize that it's not profitable to have a few cashiers waiting for the customers.  Rather, they have one at most that is usually the slowest in the state.  As soon as the line becomes too long, say five customers, a second cashier is called and the line splits momentarily, until the first line is widdled down, then the second person disappears to god knows where.
So there I am, awaiting my turn three deep in a line, just behind two mothers who I suppose had waited until the day shifts ended to get their food.  The four of us were the only ones in sight.  Out of nowhere a woman approaches and pushes her cart to the front and asks, ""Where's the tuna aisle?""  Is there a tuna aisle?  Look for yourself moron!
The cashier gave her an answer, ""Aisle four"", and she turned and, get this, made me move to get by!  I was incredulous.  The line behind me, meanwhile, had grown to a solid six, and I could see the next cashier coming.  He asks the woman directly in front of me to swithc registers, but she declines since her stuff is unloaded.  I jump on the opportunity and am at the next register before he says a thing, beaming.
Transaction complete, I begin to leave the store with a feeling that something hasn't been rectified.  Then the loudspeaker comes on, ""Cleanup aisle four, there's tuna all over"".  My night was complete."

"event","Everyone's pissed off right?  I walk around and am convinced that the general populus surrounding me, wandering from destination to origin, must be just teed-off, exploding from a condensed sense of rage and pain.  We're cheated too much in this world but never to we stand up and say, ""Hey.  This sucks.  Knock it off.""
I'm trying.  God knows I'm trying to change.  I think I'm making a difference by setting an example or some shit like that, but then I see a person asking for change on the street.  I just want to kneel before him and tell him I'm trying, but I can't even give him a dollar because I use my fucking debit card for so much these days.

My favorite part of the day is walking up-traffic on a busy road.  Of course on the sidewalk, but right on the edge so if a big enough breeze came along I'd be whoosed into the grill of a speeding SUV piloted by an oblivious middle-aged woman with all the dead, crumbly leaves that crunch beneath my boots.  I glare at the drivers, especially those driving alone.  If someone looks nice, I'll manage at least a smudgy smile, trying hard to break my mindset to treat them to my grin.  No one wants a stranger to smile at them, anyway."

"event","What's another birthday, really?
I told a few people it was today (only because conversation of weekend plans led there) and they wished me ""Happy Birthday"".  It was nice to hear, I suppose.  Hell, it definitely was nice to hear.  And it's always a pleasure to have a sister or mother call.
In the end, the only thing that changed is the distance to my drivers license expiration date.  It's supposed to be the day of the year where everyone's working for you, the troubles of yesteryear can wash away in a tide of warm greetings.  But tomor-year they are back just the same as before.  

Ah, I'm just jaded I guess, trying to hide from loneliness that doesn't go away no matter the day.  No mistakes, though, I like my time alone and do spend time in company of others, but loneliness happens, right?  And it sure doesn't just wash away worries magically to cure that.

I find consolation for my troubles in my pending journey, to happen momentarily.  A good ol' bus ride with ears full of music, a picture of civilization framed in a tinted emergency window, and a good book of short stories by Sedaris.  And it's my birthday."

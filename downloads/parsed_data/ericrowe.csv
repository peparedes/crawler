"event","There's a reason I've held onto my LJ for nearly a decade. Scrolling back through old posts a couple nights ago, was like reconnecting with those times and events. It was a potent experience... up to the point where my posts just kinda dwindle away to nothing. I have much less recorded here to represent more recent years.

It's not a total blackout; while there's almost nothing on myspace, and facebook just isn't gonna happen, there is stuff elsewhere, entries on flickr and fetlife. There's a ton of secondlife chat and IM logs. But... I like LJ. Really, just that simple.

My time is a lot more rigorously budgeted now than it used to be. I doubt I'll be posting on even a weekly basis, let alone the multiple daily posts I used to enjoy. But when I can, I aim to record my goings-on here, to help me make some coherent sense of the time so rapidly passing.

Namaste.

"event","My friend <lj user=""mphtower""> once worked as a repair tech for a chain of music stores. I figure this was sometime in the early-to-mid '90s. I went with him a few times when he had to drop by the repair shop, and was always fascinated by all the arcane tools and equipment covering the bench. I got more and more interested, and tried to ask what I hoped were relevant questions. Mike was always happy to explain stuff, but the answers didn't always sink in. 

I recall that one night I expressed some frustration with the difficulty I was having at the extreme low end of the learning curve, and eventually resulting in the following exchange:

Mike: &nbsp;&nbsp; ""So, do you know how a toaster works?""

Eric: &nbsp;&nbsp; ""Well, sure.""

Mike: &nbsp;&nbsp; ""No, really - do you know? <i>Have you looked inside to find out</i>?""

It's not often that we're able to point to specific moments as pivotal to our personal evolution, but that was a big one, a cast-iron skillet of satori upside the skull, leaving it permanently dented, but I think more interestingly shaped.

As proof of my sanity, let me first show off the headstock of my former twelve-string acoustic, now - by the power of Science and a #0 Phillips screwdriver - reborn as an eight-string. Behold the beauty of its gap-toothed maw:

More interesting still though, would be the following, a 3/4-size 'student' guitar. Someone at the factory evidently didn't think students would need proper fret placement, with the result that its intonation is completely nonexistent. As a lap steel though, it's fantastic... well, now that I've 'enhanced' it a bit. Here's a closeup of the bridge and tailpiece:

"event","Good morning y'all. I'm sorry to have dropped off the LJ radar for so long - I don't think I've read more than a handful of posts in the last six weeks. Things have been busy, but for the most part I've been doing okay at keeping up with it all.

One week ago, at this very moment, I was standing by the side of Arlington Boulevard, taking down insurance information for the Audi A4 that plowed into the back of my Bronco at 45mph. Simple stop-and-go traffic incident, happens to lots of folks; no injuries, no acrimony. My bumper has already been replaced, and my frame straightened and found healthy. The insurance folks were very pleasant and professional - big ups to Nationwide Mutual.

The weekend before the accident was our annual Beltane campout, which has been written up elsewhere far better than I have time to do here. Suffice to say that it was a ton of work, but totally worth it. Big, big fun.

Last item on the list is one that's been in the works for a while. This summer will see the release of my first real album, a five-song EP called 'The Problem With Romance'. The genre could best be called Acoustic Darkwave, with tendrils extending into more traditional folk music here and there. The mastering is finished, I like how it sounds, and I hope you will too. More details will be posted here as they become available.

Okay, work is starting to heat up, so I'm afraid that's all I've got time for today. Take care folks, I'll catch you on the flipside."

I don't think this is the gears fault, my <a href=""http://line6.com/toneport/"">rig</a> is pretty flexible. The problem is simply that I need to hear the guitar playing in order to set the controls right, but when I'm playing the guitar, I can't also be fussing with the controls. Further complication - when playing, the guitar becomes a physical obstacle to reaching said controls. 

This is why I need a guitar-playing robot.

1. Leave work at 18:00, notice that front left tire on Bronco looks a bit low. Resolve to stop on way home to add more air.
2. Drive one half block down Wilson before rim is scraping ground. Pull into loading zone to change tire. Call <lj user=""fenriss""> to inform that I'll be late getting home.
3. Discover that spare tire bracket plate is broken, preventing removal from spare. Attempt various workarounds, to no avail. Call AAA for assistance.
4. <lj user=""fenriss""> arrives, to keep me company while I wait for AAA. When driver shows up, he is in a pickup, not a tow truck, and is there to help me change the tire. However, the bracket remains stuck, and finally he calls for a tow truck, ETA about an hour.
5. We are expecting guests, so <lj user=""fenriss""> heads home to greet them. Wrecker shows up at about 20:30. Weather is clear but very cold, and I am not dressed for it. By the time I climb up into the cab I'm shivering hard, way down in the solar plexus.
6. Drive home is entertaining. Driver is young, maybe mid-20s, and playing nu-metal on stereo. We are wearing identical <a href=""http://www.redkap.com/product2/objectviewer.aspx?Type=Desc&ObjectID=26374"">Red Kap</a> work jackets, though I doubt he regards his as a fashion statement. We talk about snow and climate change, and what constitutes a really sucky job. It's a little past 21:00 when he finally offloads the Bronco by my house.

<div style='display:inline; font-weight:bold;'>Saturday:</div> 
Procrastinated. Also picked up Gibson from shop, plays much better.

<div style='display:inline; font-weight:bold;'>Sunday:</div>
1. Drag spare tire onto back porch, attack bracket with angle grinder. It doesn't give up easy, but eventually I have a usable spare again. Truck is jacked up, flat is removed, spare bolted in place. 
2. Jack is released. When full weight of truck comes down on spare, it is revealed to also be flat. Evidently it had just enough air to look okay, but not enough to hold up the truck.
3. Go inside. Get warm. Pout for about an hour.
4. Notice that snow has started falling. Rush out to finish before snow or ice become obstacles. Jack up truck again, remove flat spare, put heavy jackstand under axle. Wrap plastic bag around brake disc to keep ice off lug threads. Put both flat tires in back of Scion.

<div style='display:inline; font-weight:bold;'>Monday:</div>
1. At about 08:00, <lj user=""fenriss""> drives me to work in Scion. We stop to drop off tires at local shop for inspection and repair.
2. At 18:00, she picks me up from work. We return to shop. Total charge is $20; the mechanic has inflated and examined both tires, but found no punctures, just dirt around rims. His theory is that the seal around the rims was broken by debris. I think cold-weather contraction of the metal may have also been a problem. Resolve to watch closely for further pressure loss. 
3. Get home, watch tv. 

<div style='display:inline; font-weight:bold;'>Tuesday:</div>
1. At 06:00, put on warm coat and head back outside. Put spare back in truck, bolt original wheel back in place. Remove stand, lower the jack. Pressure seems to be holding. Go back inside, shower and change.
2. Around 07:30, drive around block. Still no pressure loss, so I drive in to work. No problems during commute.
3. Current time is about 10:15, and pressure still looks good. Will continue to monitor, but I'm allowing some guarded optimism..."

She's had a moderately high fever since sunday, which hasn't broken yet. We do have her on antibiotics, prescribed by the ER doc we saw sunday night, so with luck we'll see some improvement soon - assuming, of course, that the doctor is right about it being some type of strep, and not tonsillitis, which is frequently viral. Hopefully the culture will be back today to tell us for sure.

I'll spare everyone the unnecessary details, but I will say that while I've had a few personal losses this year, I've also been unreasonably lucky, all things considered. I've got a fantastic wife, a loving family, wonderful friends... and I've got my music, to help me vent the harder stuff in ways that don't involve patching up the drywall later.

This song has been around for a long time, first recorded by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson"">Blind Lemon Jefferson</a> in 1928. I grew up listening to the Bob Dylan version, which was released in 1962, a decade before I was even born. It's been covered by a lot of other folks, which I guess puts me in pretty good company. Anyway, I do hope you folks will like this one. It's a song I've loved for a long time.

So last night the Wife and I picked up Ms. <lj user=""lilu22""> and headed off to the 9:30, there to see Rollins and X. Ran into <lj user=""joanarkham""> and <lj user=""citizen_ken"">, as well as Slash, who seldom misses a Rollins appearance in DC. Both bands were in 'classic lineup' mode, although HR's bass player was Melvin Gibbs, who is of a slightly more recent vintage. He's a killer bassist though, and a really good guy, if the interview I just read in Tape Op is any indication.

While there, I had the weird realization that I had actually been present at the first post-Black Flag Rollins show at the old 9:30. That would have been the 'Lifetime' tour in 1987. Nineteen years ago. I was too young to drive, so <lj user=""housepig""> and I, along with our friend James, caught a ride with Johnny and <lj user=""djkangal""> in John's old Chevelle. That was my first and only stage-diving experience, and there's a very good chance that the roadie who pushed me off the stage was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cole_%28roadie%29"">Joe Cole</a>. 

Rachel wasn't feeling well, and is still having trouble with a sprained ankle and a bruised toe, so unfortunately we did have to leave before X was done playing. Damn though - they put on a hell of a show. I've never taken the time to get very familiar with their songs, but I guess I'll now have to remedy that..."

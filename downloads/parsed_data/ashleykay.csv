"event","Now that I've come off of my fast I feel sooooo great!! I was a good girl for the last couple of weeks and I stuck to my healthy eating routine for almost the whole time. I say ""almost"" because, there were a couple of nights that the girls and I decided to go out and get a bit wild and I was talked into having a couple of ""healthy"" drinks at the bar. lol. We were at this really great vegetarian restaurant in the city and the bartender there made me something that he called ""healthy"" at the time. It was freshly pressed apple juice, and ginger juice, and gin over ice. It was SOOOOO good!! ....or should I say that THEY were sooooo good!! LOL. Well, I figured that if I was eating healthfully then I could spurge and have a couple of drinks too!! =P  The indulgence was well worth it though I promise! I was so impressed with this bartender's skills and the drinks that he made me, that I decided to take him home with me! hehehe. Although, I really must say that there is always a flip side to everything, and there certainly was one in this case because the dude's skills in other departments were definately lacking!!! Believe me, after a few drinks, giving a lesson on ""how-to-screw"" is the last thing that I want to be doing. CAN YOU FEEL ME LADIES?!! lol. On top of it all, after the deed was done, the guy asked to borrow some gas money just so he could get back home!!!! Can you say: ""FUCKING LOSER!!!""?? Oh my god. I thought to myself, 'I just tipped you at the bar for my drinks, and now I have to pay you again just to get rid of you'?? Perhaps it serves me right for fucking a bartender though. 

I should have known!!!!!

"event","I started another one of my ""cleansing"" routines today. You know, eating right, juicing, working out harder, all of that icky stuff!! I always feel so good afterwards, but it's the initial getting started period that is always the bitch of it all! I figure after about a week of this, I'll be in tip top shape to get right back into the swing of things with my martinis and paries! *teehee* 
Oh, speaking of which, for all of you that didn't already know, you can now find me at ""the fucking party"" but I'll pop back into the bar every so often just to say hi, so I'll still be close by! =)). Yes I know, you miss me already don't you? *blush* haha
I also need to give props to my guy Dave from Nabraska who sent me some GORGEOUS lingerie to wear! I just got it yesterday Dave and I LOVE IT!! Thank you soooo much!! You're a gentleman and a sweetheart, but I'm still horny so you need to call me back asap okay?! LOL. I swear that I've been so lucky with the type of patrons that I've met here at the bar. All of you guys spoil me!!! ...AND I LOVE IT!! However, I'm still waiting for a new bitch to train, so for any of you who might be up for the challenge, call me. It's been quite some time since I've had a subservient piece of shit to boss around, so I'm very much in the mood to take that out on someone. Could that someone be YOU?? hehehehe. 
I'll be here wating.

"event","I LOVE this time of year because the beaches are now wide open!!! YEAH!!. But the best part about it I think, is being a grown up and not having to go back to school at all! haha!! I get to play at the beach all morning if I want to, which is exactly what's going to be on my agenda for today. I'm totally exhausted from an AWSOME weekend. I had some friends in town for a few days, and let me tell you things got pretty wild if I do say so myself!! A whole bunch of us got together and rented a bungalow and had a huge 3 day ""slumber"" party. It was SO incredible that I think that I'm still a bit hung over right now, so please forgive me. lol *ehem* It started out with about 10 people on Friday night and quickly grew to almost 75 at one point on Saturday night. (But that's another story). The girls and I wanted to have an end of summer bash, and to celebrate a friends 6 month trip to europe, so we wanted to make sure that we'd have a party to remember. And we did!! =)) 
Friday night was sort of a ""girlie"" night with 10 of us girls just drinking, gossiping, and getting VERY tipsy. In fact most of us ended up sleeping on either the sofa or on the floor in the livingroom that night. The next day, someone got up at about noon to get us some ""breakfast"" which was later followed by some sun tanning, and then some more margarita's. By about 6:00 pm, a few hotties from the neibourhood who we hardly knew started dropping by, just to ""say hi"", according to them *wink* =)) But it ended up worth our while because they brought some some more really cool people with them. I've always have been of the ""the more the merrier"" school of thought anyway, so it was a great night. I won't tell on anyone here, but for some of us it was a better night than most. ....And you know who you are!! LOL!! Sunday and Monday ended up being beer and BBQ days. It's funny who just 'drops in' when they get a whiff of a good BBQ huh?! I swear I haven't met more ""neighbours"" in my life than I did that day. ...or heard more 'pulled pork' jokes. I swear when you get enough beer and BBQ in someone, ANYTHING becomes funny!! 
I was an awsome time, but I think it's time for another one of my internal cleansing routines. You know, juicing, eating right etc, for the next little while. I always feel good after a nice cleaning out! I love the feeling a a nice bit of ""roughage"" going through me. 

Don't you?! lol

"event","Hi all! I've just come back from an entirely FAB 3 day mini-vacation in Cabo. =))! A few of the girls and I decided to head down there for a little rest and relaxation for a few days, and athough we all had a great time, I got very little ""rest"" while there! lol. We arrived early Friday afternoon where the very first party started in our hotel room. My friend Sheila decided that it would be an appropriate idea to Christen the occasion with a bottle of Cabo Wabo! hehehe! If any of you don't know, ""Cabo Wabo"" is a type of tequila created by Sammy Hagar (...'THE' Sammy Hagar of Van Halen fame!!). Cabo is apparently his second home and so he decided to ""give back"" by creating a tequila dedicated to his favorite vacation spot. It's supposedly some of the best tequila out there, and it certainly didn't disappoint us at all! By about 8 pm, we were ALL quite tipsy and then decided to head down to the local hangout for some more drinks and some good music. It didn't take long before Sheila's top came off and the 'Cayote Ugly' dance on top of the bar began!! OMG, I'm STILL laughing about that one every time i think about it!! After a few more hours of this madness and mayhem, and a false Sammy Hagar sighting, we stumbled back to our hotel rooms to sleep it off. Saturday morning began with champagne and orange juice for some of the girls, but those of us who had over-indulged the night before, refrained from any of the bubbly until later that day. *wink*! The rest of the daylight was dedicated to sun bathing and the beach, but later that night we were invited to go to dinner with a group of gentlemen from Texas. God I'm a sucker for a good accent! LOL. They were a group of financial planners on a ""detour"" from a business vacation who, it seemed, not only wanted to invest our money for us, but to invest some time in our pussies as well!! The thrill was a little to tempting for some of us because there were those who didn't make it back to the hotel that night. But don't worry Sheila, Lisa, and Christie. Your secret's safe with me!!! HAHAHA!!!!! 
This morning began with a little more sand and sun until we had to leave for the airport. I swear I didn't want to leave!! While we were on the plane the girls and I were already planning when we could come back. Perhaps I should plan a 'Fucking Bar' tour to Cabo. All of the girls and a few lucky bar patrons?!! 
I'd TOTALLY be up for that!!! How 'bout you Charlie? lol."

"event","Hi-de-ho everybody!

I'm a little hung over today, but I'll pull through! I'm a trooper!!!! lol. I had an amazing time out with the girls last night, and only lord knows how many bottles of wine we went through, but it was well worth it because we had a SERIOUSLY good time. We went out to this really great Italian restaurant that we all love, and ordered all of the deliciously fattening things that none of us usually allow ourselves to eat. What's funny too though, is that when the wine and the good food started flowing, people started to get REALLY comfortable with their surroundings, so with all of the ""loose lips"" in the room I heard some pretty juicy gossip! hehehe! 
One girlfriend of mine was in a 3-some with her boss and another man who was a friend of his. Her boss is apparently one of those homophobic, macho type of jerks who would never usually be caught dead in a 3-some with another man involved. My girlfriend said that at one point she got up and went to the kitchen for a drink or something, and by the time she came back, her boss and this other guy were going at it together full speed! LOL. I guess things got so wildly good that he lost all of his inhibitions about homosexuality huh??!! What so funny is, is that this guy is constantly priding himself on his ""manhood"", so after all was said and done, he was so embarassed by what happened that he BEGGED my girlfriend to forget about what he had done, and not to tell anybody!! hahaha!! We all laughed hysterically last night about dropping subtle hints to him indicating that the cat was out of the bag, by mysterious telephone calls or notes, or something. lol. 
That's the funny thing though. No one is really immune from a dirty deed or two that a person might not normally engage in, when the mood is right. I mean, I myself have done some pretty freaky things that I thought that I would never ever do. Like the time that I had a 3-some with my sister and her husband!! *BLUSH!!* HAHAHA!!!! 
...Now THAT was a good time!!!

I kind of feel like I should be arrested or something! James from Wisconsin just called and got me off big time! I love it when I'm worshiped, and he didn't disappoint me whatsoever. James decided that he would read dirty stores to ME for a change, but then change the past tense in the story to the present tense, and changed the names so that they were ours, and oh...my....god...... I came 3 times. Need I say more ladies?! James has a REALLY sexy voice that sort of sounds like a combination of Darth Vader, and Brad Pitt. I know, weird huh? But it's enough to make any woman cream her jeans let me tell you!! *wink*!! 
I mean come on ladies, if Darth Vader hadn't crossed over to the dark side, wouldn't YOU like him to read you a bed time story too?!! ....COME ON!! ADMIT IT!! lol!! ...""FUCK ME WITH YOUR LIGHT SABER, YOU EVIL BASTARD! YES, YES!!...OH YESSSS!!!"" hahaha!!! 
I've really been into anal sex alot lately too. I mean, I've always had a ""thing"" for it, but it seems like I've managed to develop a second clit in my rectum recently or something!! I mean it's gotten pretty bad.... vibrators, dildos, carrots... you name it. I fucked myself so hard the other night that I was sore for 2 days afterwards, and that STILL didn't stop me from doing it some more!! *blush* As a matter of fact, I wanna get laid again right now!!!!!

I know, it really sucks but what can you do you know... we all gotta go sometime right?. He had a heart attack in the bathroom of a movie theatre, and by the time they got him to the hospital it was too late. =(( I can surly say that he did have a great life though. He was a very happy and jovial guy that was always the life of the party. I think that some of those same party ""skills"" still run in the family! *wink* I think that it's because of that reason, that the wake was not as sombre of an occasion as it could have been. We all made a toast to him with a Guinness beer (which was his favorite drink), and then exchanged fun stories and memories with some of the non-family members there. I know that he would have been proud!! 
Thanks to all of you guys who knew and send me email messages. I greatly appreciated the kind words. You are all the best!

Athough the names need to remain annonymous to protect the not-so-innocent, but your girl Ashley was bumping elbows (..among other things, ...*oops, was that out loud?*) with a VERY well known person last night, and I'm STILL recovering!! I just got home at about 6:00 this morning, with visions of limos and bling-bling dancing in my head!!! OH-SO-FABULOUS HONEY!!
My ""posse"" (the girls) and I got an invite last week to a private party at a very ritzy hotel which, at the time, none of us thought anything about. We got there at about 10:00 last night, and let me tell you the place was JUMPIN'!! The whole scene kicked some SERIOUS ass! The DJ rocked, nothin' but the ""beautiful people"" were to be seen, and there seemed to be ENDLESS glasses of champange being passed around. We all thought that we were dreaming!!!!! 
Initially, the only person that we recognized at the time was the guy who was hosting the party, and who had invited us to begin with. We knew that the only reason that he invited all of us in the first place was because he wanted some ""filler"" or ""eye-candy"" of one sort or another, but quite franky none of us gave a shit!!! LOL! As each of us grabbed a drink and started scoping out the place, we all gradually started seeing people and faces that looked familiar but that we couldn't quite place. ....That is until we got an up close and personal look. Although I've been sworn to secrecy, let's just say that there were about 6 people there that absolutely ANYONE would have given up their first born to meet!! ( I still can't quite believe it)
One celeb in particular got quite cozy with me in one of the V.I.P booths and proceeded to reveal to me one of his quite famous...or now infamous assets!! *hint,hint!!* I swear to god, I wish that I could have had a video camera or something to document what went on last night, because the National Enquirer would have paid me some BIG ASS BUCKS for this shit let me tell you!!! To make a VERY long story short, the party ended up in the hotel room of this particular celeb, and the people in the neighboring guests called the hotel security on us and threated to call the police too!! HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!! OMG!!
I really wish that I could tell you guys more, but I really need to keep my mouth shut about a lot of it. I know, I know, I'm SUCH a selfish bitch and a tease aren't I?!! Well, sorry, lol! But what can I say, other than the fact that... 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY FUCKIN' LIFE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!

But believe me, you can bet your ass that as soon as the clock strikes twelve, I'm getting out the blender!! LOL!! I swear, there's nothing like a frosty drink when it's hot outside. Now, all I need to make the day absolutely perrrrrfect is a little Bob Marley! *wink!*. 
Right now, I'm wearing the new lingerie that Ted from Ohio has just sent me. It's GORGEOUS TED!!!!! *SMILES WITH A BIG-ASS GRIN!!* teehee! I LOVE lingerie, and this bra and panty combo from Agent Provocateur surely didn't disappoint me!! THANK YOUUUUUUUUU!!!! *KISSES!!* But where the hell's the godiva chocolate that you promised Ted?!!! I NEED MY SUGAR!!! LOL!!! I'll forgive you this time. *wink*. It's pink and black see-through french lace with really elaborate stitching. To die for honey!! TO DIE FOR!! Unfortunately though, I think that he created a monster because now, I want another set!! (Don't worry Ted, the next set's on me! haha!).

It's almost as if everybody's just itching and waiting for the next party, or good time to begin. I've had some exceptionally horny callers lately too. lol. You guys can never get enough is seems, when the weather gets hot and girls like me are constantly running around in tube tops and short shorts!! *teehee* 
My favorite call was from John from Florida who wanted to take his time to watch the beads of sweat build up on my tits, and then gently lick each bead off with the tip of his tongue. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!! ""Mommy you're soooooo salty""!! haha! (Hi John! *wink*) 
You made me cum 3 times John!! Thank you! =)). 
I've been masturbasting a hell of a lot this week too! LOL! ""Mr. Big"",(that's my dildo) has come out to play about 10 times this week already. For some reason, I've been having this new fantasy about my gynocologist, who actually does happen to be a really hot looking guy. I've been having a re-occurring fantasy where he takes advantage of me while I'm just minding my own business in the stirrups! *grin!*

I absolutely love fireworks, and could have stayed there the whole night. I swear, I might even have the nerve to get married on July 4th one day, just so that I can watch the fireworks for each of my anniversaries! Actually, I think that Ozzy & Sharon Osbourne celebrate their anniversary that day too! lol  
Unfortunately though, I was back to my old habits yesterday as well. oops =)) Meaning, that I ate one too many hot dogs, and I had a couple too many Heinekin. ...But IT'S THE 4TH OF JULY DAMNIT!! ..So why the hell not right?! lol. There will be plenty of time hereafter for cleansing my oh-so-delicate system, so no worries there! *grin*. Actually speaking of cleansing, my girlfriend was telling me last night that she's recently gotten into getting a 'colonic' cleansing every now and then. You know, where they shove a tube up your ass and into your colon, and flush out all of the left over stuff that's there even AFTER you've come out of the bathroom?? LOL! I KNOW, I KNOW!! It totally sounds like the grossest thing ever but she SWEARS up and down that she's never felt better!! She said that you feel so light and bouncy afterwards that you almost want to do it everyday!!

I went out this morning to pick up some coffee and bagels from the local cafe, and as I was walking down the street on my way back home, I found a $100 bill in some bushes by the sidewalk!! Initially I was totally excited, but then I thought to myself, ""what if it's fake!"" lol!!. I looked around to see who had dropped it but there was no one to be found, so I picked it up and took it to the bank to check the authenticity, and low and behold it was actually REAL! Waahoooo!! The best part of this is that I just got a speeding ticket the other day and I was sooooooo pissed off about having to fork over so much money for something so completely stupid, but now it's covered. Yea!! =))
I'm also really happy that my headache from my new braids has finally subsided. I really love my hair like this, so I think that I'm going to keep it for the rest of the summer. I never new that men would love it so much either! I keep getting all of these: ""you look SOOOO exotic!"" comments all of the time. Who knew that Alicia Keys was having this much fun huh?! lol!!

On another note, I MUST give a shout out to ""Randy Rob"" from last night. (Hi Rob! *grin*). He's new to The Fucking Bar, but this guy REALLY knows how to rock a girls world let me tell you, so watch out ladies! haha!! You know, it's really nice to have a guy cater to MY desires once in a while, and boy did he ever. I think that I'm getting wet just thinking about it again!! lol. Being the gentleman that he is, he said that it was imperative that he let me cum first before he would even let me satisfy him. He made me use a vibrator on myself and leave it in while he told me all of these nasty little stories about his recent escapades. He brought me right to the edge, and then just left me hanging there for the longest time before he would let me have an orgasm. WOW! It's been a hell of a long time since I've literally BEGGED a man to cum, and man oh man, was I ever begging!! I have to say, that that was probably one of the BEST orgasms that I've had all month long! You're a naughty boy Rob, and I thank you for it! Keep 'em coming and I can't wait to talk to you again! =))

It's been so incredibly hot outside lately, that I decided that it would be nice to have my hair put into braids so that I don't have to bother with it in the heat. (ladies, you know what I'm talking about right?!). There's nothing more annoying than having your long hair stick to your sweaty neck and back and then having to constantly put it up in a ponytail just to get it out of the way. I wanted something kind of funky, so the girl at the salon did these kind of Alicia Keys style corn rows all over my head. They look absolutely amazing, BUT it did take about 4 hours and man, oh man, did it ever KILL!! lol!! What torture us girls go through just to look gorgeous huh?! Right now I have a raving headache and my head is totally throbbing. The hairdresser said that the soreness should subside in about a day or two and that I should be fine. The really cool thing is that I don't need to brush my hair for the next three weeks!! YEA!! I can just roll out of bed, get dressed, and go, without having to deal with a curling iron or a comb or anything at all. I'll take a little pain for that! *grin* I also think that my new braids will look killer with this new bikini that I bought today too. It's a red, green, and yellow, crochet style bikini that kind of looks like those hats that those rastafarians wear if you know what I mean. I REALLY look like an island girl in it and it makes my tits look great! hehe.

By the way, we all had such a great time on Friday night at the club; as usual! Nothing too out of the ordinary occured, other than the fact that a street mime fell in LOVE with my girlfriend Lisa. LOL!! I swear to god! We were walking down the street and this mime stopped her and wouldn't let her leave! This happened on the way there, and he was waiting for us ALL NIGHT LONG to come back ut of the club to catch her again! We were laughing about that one all the way home. I swear, sometimes the things that happen to us are better than television!!

I FINALLY went and saw Kill Bill V.2 today. Practically everyone that I know was absolutely raving about it, and I was soooo disappointed! Was anyone else as disappointed as I was? I mean really, that was definitely NOT some of Quinten Tarantino's best work  I have to say. Some of my girlfriends who'd already seen it came with me to see it again, but I found myself really missing Lucy Liu's character. She was THE BOMB in volume one didn't you think? I just LOVED that ass kicking karate bitch charater of hers and I thought that we'd get a chance to see her again, at LEAST in some flashbacks or something! *sigh* Come on Quinten, get with the program man!! This for the record, is one of my major pet peeves; that is, wasting my money on a shitty movie instead of waiting for it to come out on video, or buying a cd just because someone said that it's ""good"" and then really finding out that it sucks!  So, in honor of Lucy's character we all decided to go out for sushi and sake, which made everything all better!! =). We were all good girls today though. No rowdiness at all! I promise! *she adjusts her halo* hehe!
As for tonight, we've some serious plans to shake our groove thang on the dance floor. Yeah baby! YEAH!!! LOL!! I've been really good lately so I deserve killer night out. I'm still on my ""purification"" thing for the rest of this weekend at least, so only water and Shirley Temples for me, but that's totally cool. We always seem to have a good time no matter where we go or what we do, so I can't wait! ...But what ever shall I wear? haha! It's always such a dilema with me isn't it? I'm feeling quite frisky at the moment I think, so something a little see- through should order I believe! *grin* I have this gorgeous little lacy black dress that I haven't worn in ages that would be PERFECT I think. Perhaps it's time to bring that little darling out again. =)) Yes! The decision has been made! I hope the guys at the club don't have weak knees, because I can seriously stop traffic in that outfit so look out boys!! *wink*

I feel really great today! Since my big hangover last week, I've decided to cleanse my body of all of the toxins that I've been putting into it. I made a pact with myself and told the girls, that there will be absolutely no drinking or rich foods for me for the next 2 weeks. So since then, I've been eating nothing but the most pure and clean foods, and it's seems to be working! It's a predominately Asian cuisine that I've been consuming, like: green teas, clear soups with lots of ginger and garlic, tofu, ginsing, fruit and veggies, etc. I have so much energy right now that it's completely scary!!! I woke up at about 3:00 this morning and was WIDE awake. I had so much energy that I didn't even know what to do with myself, so I started cleaning and organizing my apartment! Can you believe it? Usually at that hour, I'm strolling in from a bar or a club or something with barely enough energy to get myself undressed and into the bed!! lol. Could this be a new me perhaps?! Who knows. But what I can tell you is that I can't remember the last time that I've had bounds and bounds of energy like this. It's nuts!! I feel like I'm walking around with an IV of adrenaline attached to me!! I feel SO great as a matter of fact, that I've decided to spend the day naked!!  HAHA!! Ok, Ok. I've spent the day naked plenty of times before but usually it was because I was just too lazy to get dressed, and not because I had a bounty of energy that I wanted to share with the world as my good deed!! LOL! Right now, I'm on my patio completely naked with my laptop, and I can hear people walking down the path behind the fence that you can easily see though if you're paying attenion. But I don't care! I FEEL FREE! I FEEL DANGEROUS! I FEEL LIGHT AND ETHEREAL! NOTHING CAN STOP ME!!! I AM WOMAN!!! LOL!!!! 
My ferret Kiwi is out here with me right now too. He has his own little playpen that I've set outside next to me and he looks like he's feeling happy and frisky in the sun too. 
Hmmmm. Can anyone figure out a use for a bubbly naked chick and a ferret I wonder? 

Just curious..... LOL

Sorry, *ehem*... It's that damn ginsing talking. haha!! =)

"event","Please forgive me if this entry doesn't make sense today. I am sooooo hung over right now!! OMG! Will someone please tell me why I do the things that I do? lol. Maybe my ferret ""Kiwi"" was boozing it up last night too because he seems to be a bit under the weather today as well. He just seems like he doesn't want to get out of this little bed today. Usually he'll scratch his cage and make a lot of noise to get me to get up and play with him and feed him but this morning he just looked up at me, rolled over and went back to sleep! haha.. He's too cute. (Mommy knows how you're feeling this morning Kiwi!)
The girls and I went to a bar in the city that has nothing but frozen drinks. You know those slurpy machines at your local 7-11? The ones with the clear glass fronts on them and you can see the frozen drinks turning round-and-round inside? Well, picture about 50 of those GIANT machines from floor to ceiling that are filled with different kinds of frozen ALCOHOLIC beverages!! It was like Willie Wonka's factory on acid or something!! LOL ...And talk about brain freezes!! All of their concoctions taste soooo good, but the real danger is that the amount of booze in them which can be VERY deceiving! I was fine for the better part of the night; dancing, sipping a frozen margarita of some sort, socializing, when all of a sudden it all hit me at once! Seemingly out of nowhere. Luckily I wasn't sick at all, but I just got REALLY tipsy, REALLY fast!! It felt like I went from zero to drunk in three seconds flat, without any pit stops in between! 
One of the girls warned me that these drinks were ""creepers"" but I quite honestly didn't take her seriously until it was too late. =( *sigh*  I know, I know. We'll, I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON OK?! 
But on the brighter side, I looked great last night!! LOL!! Do you remember that old Saturday Night Live character that Billy Crystal used to do? That: ""you look marvelous"" guy? Well, remember that his character also used to say that ""it's better to look good than to feel good!"" LOL. Seriously though, it's not that I necessary believe that mantra or anything, but it does seem to help your mood when you're looking great. =)) I had on a beautiful white Prada dress which was strapless, opened toed strappy shoes, and a smile. *wink wink*  I got a lot of compliments, and even a marriage proposal! *blush*  But even with all of the fun that was to be had last night, I'm certainly paying for it now though. I honestly think that for the next week or two, I'm going to eat nothing but fruits and veggies and water just to clean out my system. Every so often I do that anyway, where I'll eat only vegetarian dishes, or I'll fast for a few days with fresh juices just to give my body a boost of raw energy. I find it quite helpful especially when I've been over indulging in a lot of rich foods and booze as I have been lately. 
Well, of I go to shove some produce into my Jack Lallane juicer now!.... lol. Wish me luck!!

I feel like such a lucky girl today! *grin*. I just received a bunch of Victoria's Secret painties in the mail this afternoon from a guy named Gary in Colorado. I ADORE getting suprise presents, and this little suprise surly didn't disappoint me! I've even decided to put a pair on right now to break them in a bit. =P. (Right now I'm wearing the satin and lacey navy blue one's if you're reading this Gary!!) ....And they are sooooooo comfy! There's nothing like the feeling of satin up against your privates huh Gary?!! lol! Thank you!! =))
Right now, I'm indulging in some chocolate truffes that were lingering around from when I was sick last week. I swear to god, I think that I need a chocolate ""intervention"" or something! There's just absolutely NOTHING like dark, bitter, boozy chocolate. MMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!  
And, for those of you who were asking, the Japanese food that my girlfriend Lisa and I had the other night was great!! All of you know that I love gourmet food, and our friend Taka, and his restaurant have never disappointed us whenever we've been there. For those of you who don't eat sushi, I say: ""....try it again!"" I know that it's an acquired taste, but I'm sure that once you get used to the idea that you're eating something raw, you'll be hooked on it for life, just like the rest of us!!  I swear that could eat sushi every night of the week and not be tired of it. Yum. It's one of the few pleasures in my life that I actually DON'T need to feel guilty about!! *teehee*

YEAH!!! *jumps for joy* Thanks to everybody who gave me all of their suggestions to get my precious body back into tip-top shape again =). I was advised of the benefits of everything from Vitamin C, to Ecchinacia (is that how you spell it? lol!), to even having MORE sugar!! (My favorite suggestion of all!).'Sweetguy' actually reminded me that perhaps I shouldn't have worn such skimpy clothing out to the bar the other night. *grin* He's absolutely right, but I just can't help it sometimes Sweetguy!! I girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do! Somtimes it's just more fun to look good, than to feel good! HaHa!! But in general, I'm just glad to be back in action again. While I was under the weather, I couldn't see any of my massage clients either so it feels good to be back there too. My phone was ringing off the hook for the few days I was gone, and a couple of my regulars even said that they didn't realize how much they missed me until I wasn't there. How sweet =) 
On the agenda today? Shopping! LOL. My girlfriend Lisa is even more of a shop-a-holic than I am, and she was waiting for me to get my ass out of bed and get well again, so that we could head over to the malls to shop. She also said something about wanting Japanese food for lunch, so we'll probably head over to her friend Taka's restaurant today too. He's got this absolutely fabulous place in the city with a really great atmosphere, and the best food ever. It's a great place to just hang out and people watch, or go to for drinks and gossip at night. So in general, I think that I'm up for a great day today; shopping and sushi! YUM!!! Can you say, HAPPY?!!! *BIG GRIN* It's absolutely ""fab"" daaaaahling!!! LOL

"event","I think that I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today which is sooooo unlike me! I think part of it has to do with some sort of a cold that I've caught so I havn't been myself. It's totally weird because it FEELS like I have a cold coming on but it doesn't seem to want to really BE a cold. I mean, I have a scratchy throat, and red itchy eyes.. but that's it. I don't have the stuffy nose, or a cough, or anything else. It's like a cold or a flu that just wants to be a complete fucking tease! lol. It doesn't want to DO anything!! It just keeps hanging around, and hanging around, ACTING like it wants to create chaos, yet it doesn't! AAAARrrrrrrrrrggggg!! Well, hang on a minute, maybe it IS doing it's job of disrupting my life after all because I'm talking about it right?! LOL!! What a bitch. 
To console myself, I've spent the day eating ice-cream. =)) I'm such a complete baby that way. The instant I feel under the weather, I use it as an excuse to indulge in one of my favorite past times.... EATING ANYTHING WITH SUGAR!!! Cotton candy, jelly beans, .....GODIVA CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES!!! MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!! All of you guys know that Godiva chocolates are some of the things that are on my ever evolving wish list, so feel free to contribute to the ""Ashley kay-under-the-weather-sugar-rush-fund""!! You know that I'm always ever so grateful, even when I'm not sick!! Speaking of which, I'd like to say thank you to Jeff in Florida for the BEAUTIFUL gift basket that you sent me!! I just got it yesterday and I LOVE IT!! It's absolutely gorgeous! As a matter of fact, it's sitting on my dining room table right now. It's HUGE, and just as pretty to look at as a bunch of flowers so I've just left it there. 
It's full of a whole bunch of gourmet foods that I love, so to me, I'll take that over flowers anyday! You're a total sweetheart Jeff, and I can't wait to talk to you again!! MMMMWWwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaa! *kisses*. 
Yes, it's true people. The way to my heart is through my stomach. 

Um....or is it my vagina?

"event","Hi everybody! 
I hope you're all well. I am. I had such a great weekend! We (the girls)spent the entire weekend in Vegas, and we're all now just coming down from all of the excitement!! 
Picture it, 6 girls, endless free drinks, a sea of chips amongst all of us, and no sleep equals one heck of a good time! teehee =)). 
We left on Friday afternoon for the Palms, and by Friday night I became a ""lucky charm"" for this great guy named 'Reg' at the blackjack tables. He would NOT let me leave his side because he kept telling me what good luck I was for him! As you know when you play, the free drinks are neverending, so that's exactly what I did! ""Margaritas for everybody!!!"" LOL!
As I stood there and ""blessed"" the hand that he was dealt each time by blowing it a kiss, he kept winning.. and BIG! He walked away with $15,000 and was so sweet about me staying with him that he actually gave me $1500. I STILL can't belive it! My girlfriends Lisa, and Kelly also won about $1000.00 each, so it was a great night for all of us. Since most of us were at least $1000.00 richer, we all decided to go out for a really ritzy dinner. It was 3:00 am, and there we were, the 6 of us eating lobster and crab, and then Lisa decided to buy a bottle of Cristal for the table! Cristal is about $500 per bottle but according to her, ""we only live once!"". Besides, we were all spending our winnings and we hadn't even TOUCHED our own money, so what the hell right?! *teehee!* 
We all got back to our hotel rooms by about 6am and only slept for about 2 hours before one of the girls was knocking on all of our doors to get up to head out to the pool. Being the troopers that we all are we thought that we could catch some ""z's"" poolside if we were still tired which is exactly what happened. Later, one of the waiters was kind enough to wake me up to remind me that we'd been out there for quite a while and he didn't want ""us beautys"" to get sunburned. What a sweetheart! Early that evening we saw a show and then headed right back to the casino for some more action! Such a deliciously vicious cycle!! I ran into Reg again that night and became his lucky charm yet again. Why can't I do that for myself?? (things that make you go ""hum?"" lol) I say this because by the time the weekend was done, I was about $300.00 in the red. =(  But that's okay because right now, as I reflect back on all of the fun, it seemed soooooo worth it!!

Wish you were there!

For those of you who were asking,(""Sweetguy"" *grin*)... YES!- I did wear my bikini to the club the other night! *hehe* But to be clear about it, I DID wear a short skirt and a see through blouse over it. =P. My girlfriend Lisa caught her second wind that night and was literally dancing on tables, but the difference is, SHE didn't have on a bikini.... or anything else at all underneath HER skirt! lol! Yes, she's bad! 
I ran into one of my massage clients at the club that night too. It's strange to see someone that you've just had your oily hands on, actually wearing clothes. I hardly recognized him! =)). To his advantage, I was in a ""giving"" mood that night, because I actually gave him a massage at the bar. That lucky bastard. He had a drink in one hand and a girl giving him a shoulder rub! I'M BECOMING WAAAY TO GENEROUS!! lol!!

"event","What a fantastic day it was today! There's just something about waking up in the morning to the bright sun shining on your face and the birds chirping their early morning songs that makes me know that the day is going to be great. And I was right! The birds are never wrong. =)
I thought that it would be a good idea to head down to the beach early today so that I could claim my spot on this beautiful Saturday morning, because I had a feeling that if I didn't, I'd never be able to find a place with enough elbow room to tan properly. You'd think that after a Friday night out with the girls that I would never have the energy that I had today, but somehow I caught my ""second wind"" and I was determined to wake everyone up with me! I called my girlfriend Lisa as soon as I woke up,(..yes she's absolutely gorgeous!) and somehow convinced her that the best thing for a hangover would be some sun. hehe! After grumbling about it for a minute, she quickly came around and saw things my way =)). The two of us got a semi-secluded spot so that we could go topless for a while. (We HATE tan lines!!) But as it turned out, we were abruptly interruped by some unexpected company! Under any other circumstance it would have been fun, except this time it was the police!!! LOL!! OOPS!! After getting a good look and then lightly scolding us, the two officers just gave us a warning about ""indecent exposure"" (with a slight grin of course) and then simply left. There never seems to be a dull moment when I'm around for some reason. It's always just my luck! After getting all of the sun we could, we spent the afternoon eating ice-cream and shoe shopping. I swear I couldn't have planned it any better!! I felt soooo relaxed today that I STILL havn't gotten out of my bikini. Maybe I'll just wear it out to the club tonight?! =P

I just got back up and running after a whole week of being ""incommunicato"" with the rest of on-line world and boy does it feel good! =) *me grinning from ear to ear!* I never realized how important my computer was until I was without one for nearly 7 day straight! But, ASHLEY IS BACK!! ...And horny as ever I might add! lol! Perhaps it's the excitement of having access to all of you again that has done something to my libido! I MISSED ALL OF YOU!!!! 
I'm sitting here completely nude while I'm typing. Well, almost nude. I do have shoes on. I just found these gorgeous new Gucci pumps, and I thought that I would spend the day breaking them in. They're black, open toed, with straps around the ankles. Absolutely stunning with my new pedicure if I do say so myself! I'm sure by now you know about me and my shoe obsession. I just can't help it, and I wouldn't even bother to try at this point! They're like my babies! When I open up my closet and I see them all lined up in a row staring at me, almost begging me to take them out with me, it's so hard to choose. I've even caught myself telling a rejected pair: ""maybe tomorrow sweetheart"". LOL!! I know it's crazy but I love it!! Maybe I'll leave my pumps on when I have sex tonight. What do you think?  Wait a minute. I think I know the answer to that! teehee!

I had a GREAT day on my birtday. A little too much fun perhaps (as usual, lol) but well worth every minute of it! My ""posse"" took me out for sushi and then we went for drinks and clubing all night long. As a matter of fact, it lasted well into the next day. But most importantly, I DO in fact, remember most of it! Teehee! Actually, I think that I'm still hung over lol!
Thank you to all of you that sent me emails and presents. You know that you'll be repaid in orgasms!!!!
Right now I'm just lounging in my ""undies"". White, cotton, thong underwear to be specific. Their brand new so I'm just waiting to have someone help me 'Christen' them. 
I think that YOU should be the one to help me! *smile*
On another note, I've been craving chocolate all day long today and unfortunately my girlfriends have eaten ALL of the Godiva chocolates that I received for my b-day. =(  Did you also know that there's a chemical in chocolate that tricks your body into thinking that it's in love? MMMMMMmmmmmm.

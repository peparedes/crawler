"event","<P>Yay! We won a game tonight :-) I am really really tired and am gonna go to bed soon. Luckily we don't have practice too early tommorow morning because we are taking pictures. Plus we KILLED Hutto tonight so everyone should be in a good mood. I can't wait until district starts next week. Our first game is against Stony Point. Hopefully we can start out 1-0. </P>
<P>So tommorow's the first day that I can apply for UT. I am really nervous. I still need to finish filling out my application and write my two essays. I have to take the SAT again on October 9th too so I have to sign up for that. Everything is so expensive! It's $50 just to apply to UT and then more to retake the SAT. Oh well though, I am gonna finish filling out my application to Rooster's and hopefully start working soon. I need some cash. Alright well I am really tired and don't have much else to say except for tonight something really cool happened and I hope it all works out. It's a secret until it does though :-) Night night! </P>

"event","<P>Wow so I really never thought I would ever get one of these things, but I got really bored so I thought I'd start one. I had to go out to my dad's tonight because my brother's birthday was on Friday and we had his party with my dad and grandparents tonight at his house. After we were done my brother brought me all the way back out to my mom's so I could study for an AP Psychology test that I have tommorow. Alex and I are supposed to study together tonight but he didn't answer his phone when I called so I guess I'll try back here in a little while. School has been going pretty well so far. It's really scary to think that this time next year I have no idea where I am going to be, who I am going to be with, or what I will be doing. Everything has always been so certain in the past and now I have no idea what I will even be doing in two weeks. It seems like everything is changing so fast. Justin left for college yesterday and it made me really jealous cause Leslie was going to visit him today. I miss having someone to miss and have them miss me in return. But in all, I must admit that the second breakup has been much easier than the first one. The first time I could hardly eat without feeling like I was gonna be sick at my stomach, but trust me, that's not a problem now. :-) I guess I miss him sometimes, but it doesn't seem to last long.&nbsp; I'm sure in a few weeks everything will be back to normal and we probably won't even talk anymore.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So last night was REALLY fun.&nbsp; We had to do this Keep Austin Weird 5K run yesterday downtown as a team and it was so hot.&nbsp; There were so many people there all dressed up in weird costumes and stuff though so it kinda took my mind off the running.&nbsp; My shoes weren't all the way broken in though so I have three blisters on my feet :-( But anyways, after we finished running our 3.2 miles, I drove everybody back to their houses so we could get cleaned up and go out.&nbsp; We went to Free Birds and ate some enormous burritos and then went to Amy's for a little ice cream.&nbsp; While we were inside Jared called my cell phone and left me ANOTHER message about this picture that he's been wanting me to get developed for him.&nbsp; His message was kinda rude and annoying so Sami called him back and left a message on his phone and said that he was annoying me and that his picture wasn't even that cool because ""it was only with John Mayer's guitar player and not even John Mayer.""&nbsp; After that I went over to Beth's and started watching a movie with her, Gabby, and Sean.&nbsp; Then I got tired and went home.&nbsp; So then I was sitting around the house about midnight and get a call from Jared asking ""why the fuck did your friends call my phone and leave that message?""&nbsp; I thought it was really funny but he was really pissed off that I ""actually let them call me when he has been nothing but nice to all of my friends and me"" (don't get me started!).&nbsp; So 20 mins. later he's at my house picking up the memory card to my camera so he can go get it developed himself.&nbsp; At least I don't have to worry about it anymore.&nbsp; After that I finally went to bed.&nbsp; It was a crazy night.&nbsp; I love all my friends, they're the greatest.</P>"

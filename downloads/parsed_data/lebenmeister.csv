"event","saw the daily show with Fareed Zakaria(sp?), it was really good. Hes very well spoken and very intelligent. Im anxious to see his PBS show.

True story: went to Subway to eat. While I was there ordering things to be put on my sandwich, an old man burst through the door. He quickly walked up to the counter and yelled at the girl helping me. Except he wasn't mad, just bilegerant. He asked if the facility was T-Mobile, (except he said Mobile like it rhymed with pedophile). 
I felt sorry for him because he was obviously lost. I felt even worse when the girl behind the counter just laughed at him. He then promptly left. It was weird though, because the Subway wasn't inside a mall or anything. So he just blatenly waltzed inside Subway, and asked if it was T-mobile. So sad, yet so funny. Typical retirement-Tucson-shit-hole-occurrance."

"event","i was just thinking about something Carl Bernstein said on the Daily Show the other night. He mentioned that he thought that journalism was like a ""sock that was being unwound"" by the government. The metaphore was in reference to the fact that a journalist is being jailed right now after not disclosing her sources. Soon or later slowly ""unwinding"" the independence the media has, being able to give objective stories.

Another thing I was thinking about was what Karl Rove wrote to that Newsweek journalist about the CIA operative, trying to smear his repution. Exactly doing the same thing throughout the whole road of Bush's journey to the White House. 

It made me think of two things that dictators/those in power tend to do when rising to power/staying in power. They saturate the media with favoring propaganda and suppress the dissidents. Does anyone else see this, or am I blowing it out of proportion?"

Yes and PBS is more biased than Fox, and all liberals get their news from the Daily Show, and Michael Moore is stupid and fat because he made up that footage of Bush and edited interviews with people, and John Kerry didnt earn his purple hearts and hes a flip-flopper, and Ann Coulter makes sense, and Bill O'Reilly never had a sexual harassment charge against him, and theres no such thing as global warming; all those scientists are being paid off, etc etc."

"event","so im fuming a bit about a man named Bernard Goldberg. he formerly worked for CBS and now has a book coming out called Bias. He talks about how he's a liberal but he thinks that the media is all liberal and the conservatives are right about our degrading society. I read an interview in the rightwing news <address>http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/goldberg.php</address> about his books. 

He was asked a question about how the liberals are taking over the media and wether or not he could give examples, this is what he said; 

 <i>I'd say, ""why do you think so"" and he would tell me the following because it's the party line; ""Well, there's talk radio, there's Fox News, and there's the Washington Times."" I'd say, ""OK, you're right, they all tilt to the right and in the world of opinion, conservatives have a lot of clout. I'll give you that."" Then I'd say, ""How come you didn't mention to me that almost every big city newspaper in America has a liberal editorial page and the columnists on the op-ed page who are almost all liberals? Why did you conveniently leave that out?"" Conservatives have a lot of clout in certain places and liberals have a lot of clout in some very, very, important places like the New York Times, the Boston Globe, & the LA Times.</i>

he mentions that conservatives have a lot of clout, isn't that exactly against what hes trying to persuade his audience against. Your damn right they have a lot of clout! thats the fucking point you moron. 
<i>almost every big city newspaper has liberal editorial pages?</i> like what/where/and who? I'de sincerely like to see an abundance of liberal papers, especially in arizona. He also mentions conservatives have a lot of clout in the world of ""opinion"" like some how an op-ed page and opinions are different. then he gives 3 examples of popular moderate-to-liberal papers, all of which have conservative counterparts. This guy is a fuckin nut ball. He thinks the liberals are taking over the media because of 3 newspapers that have moderate-to-left articles. Give me a fucking break.

He was also on the Daily Show trying to promote his book. John gave him a bit of a whipping but I think he was more interested in keeping things calm, and giving his opinion about how the ""real"" issues should be heard.
<address>http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/videos/most_recent/index.jhtml</address>. I thought it was interesting though how John pointed out that the majority of people he complains about are liberal, and that every single one of them are powerless and have multiple conservative variants. In other words, for every liberal you find, you'll find 3 conservatives. Yet he neglects that. 

It was an interesting interview because I think you really see what Goldberg is trying to say. I think Goldberg has more of an issue with the current generational social changes, than with anything else. 

He seems to hate vulgar rap, and thinks everyone is being induced by it. I mean he totally sounds like a senial old grandpa. Its actually quite sad. I dont think hes come to the conclusion thats hes at that age where his ""liberalism"" back in the Kennedy era is actually conservative. Maybe he should find out what conservative means. what a fucking moron."

read the ferret owners manual, i cant wait to get them.

read an interesting ebook, it was something about hypnotising people. It was interesting but very self diluted. I think the author is a little bonkers. He was talking about how pedophiles are part of a secret society that are trying to brainwash people for satan. It was interesting though because he obviously knew his history, he just totally goes off on some bizarre interpretation of it. He went off about how he thinks the CIA is trying to interpret all these studies done on twins at the concentration camps in germany. he says the person that performed them was a satanist trying to figure out genetic behavioral secrets, so he could ultimately build an army of hypnotized slaves. and now the CIA was trying to do that. And that only people with a certain family lineage, reguardless if they are in the CIA, has access to those documents; located in a heavily fortified basement in washington DC. wow, this author is quite interesting.

on another note i also downloaded a bunch of chomsky pieces. got me thinking about the role our media plays and where the placement of power and propaganda tends to come from.

also got the anarchist cookbook, pretty funny stuff in there; and the marajuanja bible."

the only fact that theyre turning out is that the filibuster was used for ill intentions during the civil rights movement. so what? the filibuster goes both ways and is strong tool against a heavely biased senate. Their article simply gives it a negative view. They say it twice that the fillibuster can be used good, bad, or nutural, but they simply emphasis how bad it can be. its like theyre trying to persuade one to join in opposition to it. what a fuckin horribly biased article, especially from them.

Well she thought Gay people were being very immature and needed to start loving themselves and get a girlfriend. Thats right, she thinks being gay is an immature lifestyle.

Cleaned my apartment amongst other art projects i had on hold.

my friend kyle called me to play raquetball then skipped out on me?

the girl i like, Erin, hasnt called about the odd predicament i got her into, or rather myself into. She said she has a boyfriend so doesnt know if i can give her rides to school. which is cool, but she hasnt confirmed anything iwith a call. No only that she  said she wants a ride? whatever...

Ned got some flash drives and is giving one to me... sweetness.

Saw my dad drive by his house when i was there getting my book case, dont know why he didnt stop. I swear sometimes i just want slap  him a good one, he can be so annoying. He didnt know i saw him but he saw my truck there and just kept going like he didnt want to comfront me. As far as a can tell we're on good terms so i have no idea whats on his mind."

at any rate she stopped by late tonight to chat with me. boy i was not in the mood. I mean I was nice but i acted very distant and shy. Shes a nice girl and i wouldnt mind going out with her i guess. maybe ill ask her.

Oh and i got this other girls number at school.

My bio class is so fun. When i came back today everybody was wondering where i was tuesday... Oh it feels so good to be wanted:) 

haha Funny story: So we were talking about air pollution in class. Since i live in Tucson and Im from California I give an example of how different the 2 places are in pollution. After i finshed my discussion another kid raised his hand and said he just went to San Diego and it was very clear there. 
The funny part happened after he said that. Thats when i simply stated ""Your worng"" very directly and loud. It was very out of place and everyone burst into laughter... Im such the comedian."

school sucks ass, I had to drop 2 of my classes because i couldn't keep up with the work.

speaking of work, i came to work an hour early. Man i sure I wished i worked during the day. With-in that hour all these hot chics kept coming in. I never get ""people"" coming in during my shift, attractive people at that.

Oh funny story... i was talking with my manager about the whole pope thing and about how they're going to elect a new one. I mentioned the question about why there aren't any women, and answered myself with a smart ass remark "" oh yeah because they're inferior to men."" well my manager, shes a young lady, just looked at me. I was waiting to get a negative reaction but all she did was agree with me. 
haha. Its funny how people tend to measure themselves up when faced with depreciating decisions in their religion. she's catholic by the way."

"event","hmm... this wilsons crap really sucks ass. Im always breaking out and my legs are always getting swollen. Plus my emotional side is connstantly fluctuating. Im usually not an emotional guy, when my emotions get the best of me im known to go out running or do something sso as to where im able to recollect the situation and put it in proper terms in my life.

lately however, i havent been able to that because im so weak. so i started writing. ive never written a journal before and i dont think i like it. since my emotional side is really flipping out i tend to say a lot of stuff that perhaps i dont really mean. Thats why i dont like writing things down because i feel like they are etched in stone. Its easier to handle things while they are floating around in my head. Its a lot easier to organize. Plus when i write things down Im trying to decribe the emotion, give an excuse for it. When i do that i end up making myself believe my excuse, no matter how irrational it is. So ive always tried not to blurt out my emotions. It has happened to me with girls too . i say things to them that arent true, i make myself feel that way because of the state of lonliness im at.
Like i did that with this one girl. She was all over me. But when i sat back and evaluated the situation, i realized we had nothing in common and no simualrities. I had ignored all her faulubiities and tried to substantuate a relationship. This will probably be my last entry in this journal, for my sake.

I hate reading my past entries in this. Most of the crap i write down isnt really me. Its not my thoughts. I totally give the wrong impression to people. Plus it sounds like i have really low self esteem and that i am constantly feeling sorry for myself. thats not true. Its sounds that way because i only write in the journal when im depressed or frusterated. Before i started writing i would run when i was depressed and when i was frusterated i would talk with someone. So anyways i hate this journal and this is my last entry"

"event","she really pisses me off. not because i bought her gifts for her birthday and christmas and she got me nothing. Not because i took her out to lunch a bazillion times and never seemed to get any true gratification from her. Not because she always tells me im such a cool friend yet never bothers to call or contact me in any way. Not because shes superficial and because of that she doesnt like me in ""that"" way, even though she said she thought i was so cute when she first saw me. But its because shes an addict and she soooo smart. I am literally watching her kill herself and waste away her potentially awesome life. 

Its because she has what i call daddy syndrome. needs something or someone to hold on to, to look forward to. A typical father-figure type of ordeal. I cant do anything for it. 2 reasons. 1) I dont know how and 2)I have no way of getting to her if i did."

"event","Ill tell you what. Mike is a pretty cool guy, i mean our sense of humor is like right on.  So hes really easy to get along with. But the thing is is that we are so different from each other, so we really dont get that bored in each others company.

 It was funny the other day. We went to barnes and noble and stole all the ""monopoly"" stickers promoting micky d's from the time magazines. So all today and yesterday weve just been eating free food. which is really helpful considering im totally broke. I really need a job.

Then today we went looking around for apartments. It was fun being with him because the whole time were like cracking jokes and the managers at the complex think were pretty fun guys.

The thing is though, which i think is interesting is that hes not too bright. All his common sense and maturity can be linked to what he pretty much lives for... music.he likes very hardcore and original stuff. thats another thing we have in common is trying to find good original bands. Well usually people who look for bands like these and originalte themselve with this type of llife style seem to have some intellectual aspect of life, Mike just mingled his way into it. Its fun also that i know more than him. He actually intentivily listens and seems to absorb the things i tell him, and when he doesnt understand he argues. Which is good because it gets me to reilliterafy whatever it is im constituting. You dont find a lot of kids like him in tucson."

"event","lets see what has happened. i went bowling the other night with kyle and Ned and not to mention Mike. Mike decided to stay the night, so he was over talking with his girlfriend when Ned and Kyle showed up. But they showed up at my back window. I thought it was dad outside tending to the dog when they knocked on my window. So i naturally yelled "" what the hell do you want"". Well Ned and kyle decided not to answer and so i just asking what do want, bla bla bla. I made a big cammotion and my dad came out of his room yelling, "" what the fuck, fuck fuck fuck, fuckity fuck fuck"". I apologised and told him to leave, hes so annoying. well anyways, after that i didnt really feel like hanging around the house so went bowling. It was ok, something to do. It kinda made me mad though, Kyle and ned always seem uncomfortable with Mike over. I think they should lighten up and have a little fun. I mean you dont need to be suave and critical every minute of the day. Well i guess Ned was cool about it.. He seemed to be enjoying himself. So we left and kyle seemed to be to good for us, or at least that what it felt like. So he dropped us back off and sped off with Ned. In the mean while Mike and I were pretty bored still and my room is very uncomfortable... stupid dad. So off we went to Coffee etc. Fun time... I cought up with Mike M. and he told me to look at that coke job.I will. I was really tired when i got home. So we went to bed, probably thee best nights sleep ive had in a while."

"event","man oh man... 
i stayed in bed all day yesterday. i was actually up and ready to go early in the morning but then i got tired and lost my motivation. so i ended up in bed the whole day. 
Im also going through another ""episode"" with my disease. I can tell because my ankles got swollen and im really starting to break out with a lot of acne. 
I got really depressed last night and decided to OD on sleeping pills ... i guess i didnt take enough, now i just have a splitting headache. I did get some sleep though and was able to wake up early. I went running around the new track at school... its so cushiony. Its nice on your feet. but the sleeping pills havent worn off yet and im very disorientated. I feel like im very drunk. It was kind of hard to run too. 
I dont think anyone called for me last night. i was suppose to go with mike to look for apartment areas. I havent been able to get a hold of him today but its still pretty early... I have mudvayne stuck in my head. Im not much of a music lover but the chorus is really catchy.

I think ned is the only person that actually calls me anymore, and its rare when he does.

I was looking at colleges on the net the other night. Im trying to find a way out of tucson, with no avail. Its kind of funny , it seems the u of a is the perfect college for everything im looking for in a college. So i guess im staying here after all... I finally did my wash and some little chores ive been meaning to do.
   
I was watching an evangilist this morning on the boob tube. She was talking about not being selfish. As iroy would have it shes already selfish to begin with. Not to mention the reasoning behind her ""rule to abide by"" is also selfish. If you are part of a religion in the first place you obviously think of yourself greater than others (species), especially if you have to work for a specific scenerioed after-life. Plus what really ties me up is that she trys to teach people not to be selfish by helping others out. Of course by helping others out youre helping yourself, thus making the chances of going to heaven greater for you. I , being an atheist, probably do more ""good"" than over 80% of the christians out there. When i go to help somebody out i do it for their benefit not mine. I get nothing out of helping them out. So you ask well why do you do it? Because, Watson, I am simply able to."

"event","im looking anxiously for a job right now. i applied at barnes and noble but i have an idea that itll probaby fall through. Mike wants to look for a around the place we plan to move to. thats another problem.
   The moving thing. I have no money and neither does he. Yet we are looking for apartments? Itll take a while before i scrounge up some good funds. i really want to move out though, so im pretty excited over the whole venture.
   Back to the job thing though. I am going toward the paper for a job now. I want to see how that goes. theres some pretty interesting jobs in here. that reminds me, david's sister told him that they really miss me at safeway. They said i was the only person that actually worked there... talk about a self-esteem booster.
   I went out with ned tonight. just to the coffee shop. we discussed this and that, pretty bland. Thats the thing with ned though, its kinda hard to carry out a good conversation. there always seems to be awkward pauses and such. i think thats why a lot of people think hes kinda weird. or perhaps its his personality.
   I was reminded of my friend johnathan tonight. i remember how johnathan was the same way, personality wise. the difference between them is that i think ned is really insecure. It seems hes try to think about what hes going to say and wether or not your going to like it. Hence the awkward pauses in the conversation. I wish he would open up more so the flow of the conversation could go a liitle more smoother. he's surprisingly down to earth though. Thats why i like to hang out with him.

 I need to go to pima tomorrow and take the assesment test and get some classes outta the way, not to mention figure out if they did my gov. money thing right. the guy seemed a little retarded and my form said summer session, so i dont know...
   have to get car registered.
  Its odd. I had a dream about missy diaz. someone told me she had a crush on me in elementary school. and now i hear she works at the soda fountain. i wish i was in california. i wonder what shes like now, i always thought she was kinda cute. I wish i had a social group to hang out with. it seems i just have a friend from this group and a friend from that.
   I dont really have much in comman with mikes friends, im not a big music lover. and Neds friends are hmmm... just odd i guess. i like ned because hes so logical and open to ideas, joe and isabel just seem to be interested in things i dont care about. but whatever, theryre still pretty nice. except for joe, i think i have a real grudge against him. but not really. i just ignore him. It has to do with the fact i think hes a whiner. Ive always been forced to suck it up and after a while have learnt the fact theat the only person thats every gunna give a rats ass about me is me. and ive always lived by the principle do unto others as you would want them to do unto you. Thats why i try to be very friendly. This motto has been enforced onn me a lot. i have learnt a lot of lessons by this. like being a jerk to somebody because of the way they treat you. then you find out theyre cleaning your car at a car wash, who knows what theyll do to it. thats why i pretty much ignore him anyways. he really needs to grow up. the world doesnt revolve around him.
when i was younger i think i tried to act the same way joe does now. however i got it all shoved in my face. but instead acting worse about it i tried to learn from it. instead of poutting about it i tried to run or something. it doesnt mean that feeling goes aay though, its just easier to deal with."

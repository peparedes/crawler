"event","Alrighty. Let's see. Last week was pretty cool. All I remember is from Wednesday on. Wednesday Toshia had to leave school early because her aunt wasn't going to make it past the day and they had to go see her. Then later that night she called me and told me she passed away. =( I love you Tosh. Thursday she came over. It was funnnn. *Sneeze* Umm.. Then she went home. Friday I went to school and it was a pretty normal day. Kyle came over afterwards. Then Saturday I got up and got in the shower. GOt ready then around 5:30 I went to a wedding with my momma. Got home at about 8:30 and Kyle came over around 9:30. We went to his house. I had to be home at 11:30. So we hung out there and then he came and dropped me off home. =) I had fun. Sunday I woke up and Kyle called. THen he went up to his grandma and grandpa's to eat. Then he got home and called me. THen he eventually came over. We went to Wal-mart and it was fun. We were silly.. sorta.. hes so cute <3 Umm then we came back to my house then we decided to go eat. We went to Fazoli's and this mother f*ing chick gave Kyle a bag of bread for free. I guess she thought he was hott.. I wanted to say somethign to her but Kyle wouldnt let me. So I'll just wait till next time I go =) !! UGH !! LoL Anyways. Then we came home and watched TV. Then he left and I got in the shower. THen this morning I got up and got ready and straightened my hair and everything. Then went to school. Then came home. Kyle stayed for a little bit and then I went to the tanning bed. He was going to mow in Kenova so he stopped and saw me. Aww how cuteee <3. Then me and ma and bethany went to the ballfield to watch my stepdad play softball. I called my daddy today whle my mom was in the tanning bed =) I told him about how I drove on the interstate on Saturday. It was cool. Umm.. then after going to watch my stepdad play ball we went home. Alisha and her momma came over and they talked about the wedding and stuff. =) Well... now Kyle's on the phone so I reckon I'm gona go and talk to him. =) Leave comments. I'm getting a new journal soon. Sarah Beth is gonna make it pretty =) Thanks Sarah!!

I love you Kyle!!*

You tend to be a romantic dreamer and<br>want you and your love to have that kind of<br>perfect love that you hear about in fairytales.<br>However that can be hard to find, but it<br>doesn't mean you are going to stop looking.

Yesterday Kyle came over at like 9:30 in the morning and I had my window open for him to wake me up. He came and got some old shitty lawn mowers to take to the junk yard to get him some money cause mom and okey said he could take them. I woke up by his truck and I went to my window and was like ""hi baby"" and then i went out back and talked to him and stuff. Then we came in and ate a bowl of Cocoa Pebbles. Then he left and took those to the junk yard. Then he came back around 1:30 because I had a doctor's appointment. Then we came back to my house and hten we just hung out and ran aroudn all day. Today I woke up and talked to him. watched TV. He came over again at 1:30 cuase i had to go to the doctor again. Umm.. after the doctor he took me to the riverfront =) aww it was so sweet. I was standing on the ledge by the water and he was behind me holding me.. it was like he didnt' wnat me to fall or something. =) he makes me so happy. so then we came here. mom ordered Gino's. Kyle and I went and paid the truck payment for Okey and then picked up the food. Came home and ate. Then watched a movie. Then we went to the Y and he worked out while I tanned. THen after that we went to Wal-Mart. I got the ""Guinea Rat"" as kyle calls it (the guinea pig) some food, slim-fast, yoo-hoos, baskin robbins candy, and gum. he got gum, circus peanuts and a buncha stuff. silly him. he didnt wanna spend money hehe. we Had a lotta fun.

Got home about 11:30 or so. Then today I went and tanned then we came back here and then we went and took my lil sis to the park then came home. Then we went and played pool with John, Brittany, and Troy. I had fun. So I got home about 11. Now I'm updating my journal and arguing with stupid people. Either way I reckon that's my update.

1) You. We have been through a lot in the last 10 months. We've had some really great and memorable times and some very hard times. No matter what happens I love you more than anything. No one can ever replace you and you will always have a place in my heart. We've been through so much with each other.. and I'm gonna love you forever.

2) You. You have been my friend since 4th grade. We have been through a lot together and then last year we drifted. We're friends again this year but we're still not as close as we used to be. Either way you have been there for me through a lot of things and I love you!

3) You. Wow have you changed. When it's just me and you talking you're still the same sweet girl you were but it's like when you get around other people you have to be all fake and stuff.. I'm kind of worried about you and I think you should settle down some. Either way we've had some damn fun times and I love you! I miss youuuu.

4) You. I just met you this year and you are awesome as crap. I've never hung out with you outside of school or anything but maybe sometime we will. I'm gonna miss you next year. Love ya!

5) You. The more I think about it the more I can't stand you. You think you're so cute and pretty but you're not. You think you can put a charm on anyone you want but you are so wrong. You pretty much suck at life and you're a whore. But of course.. you already know that. Sorry =)

6) You. You are so 2 faced. You talk so much shit about people who are supposed to be your friends more than anyone I know. What kind of friend is that? I bet that by the time you graduate.. you'll not have any friends.

7) You. You are so nice. We talk quite a bit but I've never really gotten to know you and everything. You're an awesome girl and I'm so glad we get to hang out and stuff. You make 2nd period not boring.

8) You. We've had some talks and I understand what you're going through. You are an awesome girl and I hope we become better friends. If you ever need me I'm here. Lylas.

Well that's it for my you entry. =) Sorry if some of them are a bit harsh.. I'm just being honest. Anyways. Today I went to school.. Kyle picked me up. Yay. =) Then we sat here.. then went to the mall and then to my dad's. That's about it for today though. No schoole tomorrow! Leave comments =)

I love you Kyle Gregory Wood!*

Taking your heart and holding it tight
Emotional touch, touching my skin
And asking you to do what you've been doing all over again

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

(Chorus)
It's your love, it just does something to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder about the spell I'm under
Oh,It's your love

Better than I was, more than I am
And all of this HAPPENED by taking your hand
And who I am now is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in (Oh)
And if you ask me why I've changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name

(Chorus)
Oh, Baby

It's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

I laughed today. I was sitting there and someone was talking about someone else. I'm not gonna mention any names. And they were talking about how this person did such and such and how it was immature and all that good stuff.. but the person saying all that does the same thing but only worse. Like I'm talking a lot worse. I'm not the only one that agree's either. I dunno I'm not trying to start anything I guess my point is.. what someone else does is their business.. don't worry about what they do.. if you don't like it then don't hang out with them or anything. Don't sit and complain about it when you do the same thing even worse. Anyways.. I went to the Y today with Kyle. =) I had fun. I think I'm gonna have my stepmom make me some tanning appointments. Yay. Get a tan goin on. But I guess that's my update for today. Leave comments?

Kyle, I love you so much. We'll make it through anything.

"event","I haven't been home since Wednesday. Alright.

Wednesday - Went to school for half a day.. Mom came and picked me up and I went and had to go to the dentist. After the dentist I got Tudor's and came home. Kyle came over when he got out of school and he stayed at my house until we left. Then Me, Momma, Okey, and Bethany headed to Corbin, Kentucky to my mamaw's. We stayed the night there.

Thursday - We got up and headed for Gatlinburg, Tennessee. My mamaw went with us. Got there and got everything unpacked and everything. Just sat around for the rest of the evening. I think we went to Wal-Mart too. 

Friday - Got up and ate. Got ready and everything then went shopping. Got a t-shirt that's it. Came back to the cabin and just watched movies and got in the hot tub.

Saturday - Momma and Okey went across the mountain to Cherokee or something. They stayed over there for a while. Me, Bethany, and my mamaw all stayed at the cabin. My mamaw was sick =(. Um. We ended up having to take her half way and meet my uncle cause she wanted to go home. Which I understand cause when I'm sick I HAVE to be home. So then I got home and talked to Kyle some and went to bed.

Sunday - Got up and got ready. Went horseback riding. Omgosh. Okey (my stepdad) was behind me on his horse and it kept getting up behind mine and my horse would kick at his and I didn't know what it was doing. Well my horse got scared and took off running and i was like ahh what do i do and the leader dude was like ""having problems back there"" and i was like ""um yeah"" cause my horse was like running and stuff. then the guy got my jacket cause it had fallen off and the horse got scared again and took off again and i was like omggg im gonna die. i almost started to cry it scared me so bad. so then i came home from that and my ass is bruised. i called kyle and talked to him. god i missed him so much. then i layed around and then about 4 we left to go to the Black Bear Jamboree. It was dinner and a show and it was really good. I liked it. So we came home from that and me and mom and bethany got in the hot tub. Got out and I took a shower again. THen I talked to Kyle.

It was pretty good. I liked it. Then we came back home and I made him a pizza and I ate a turkey sandwich. Yummy. So he left at like 11. Then Sunday I woke up to Mom asking me if I wanted to go to Wal-Mart again and I was like nooo. They came back with 3 movies. Walking Tall, Open Water, and Princess Diaries 2. Kyle came over and we watched Open Water and hung out. Thennn Monday.. after school I went to Kyle's and sat there while he took a shower. Left there about 4 and came back to my house and watched Walking Tall. Then watched Princess Diaries 2. Then he left. Umm.. this morning woke up got ready went to school. Normal day. Momma picked me up. Came home and ate taco bell. Then talked to Kyle on the phone. Watched some TV. Then I fell asleep for like an hour or so. Then watched some more TV and now I'm talking to Kyle and he didn't get to come over which makes me sad. I have no friends anymore. Blah. =( I'm leaving it at that. Leave comments.

My dad was there helping too =) yay. Then me and Kyle came back to the house after goign to speedway for a cappucino. then he left at about 9 maybe. monday we had a two hour delay so that was cool. school went by pretty fast. i didn't feel too good monday though.. and my mom had came home from work early because she was sick. so today i got up and got ready. went to school. it was pretty normal.. i was kinda tired. heres what we did.

Spanish - Vocabulary
Phys. Ed - ""conditioning"" and hten got to go up to the wrestling place and play on the ropesss yay
Science - Copied the answers to homework from like a week ago
History - Graded a paper and worked on worksheet

SO that was today. Nothing outta the ordinary. Soo after school Kyle gave me a ride home. I came inside and I started to not feel good. My stomach was hurting so bad and it wouldnt' go away no matter what. I layed down but I couldn't fall asleep because it was hurting so bad. Talked to Kyle for a couple minutes on the phone. Then drank some hot chocolate. Mom made food but I didn't eat. =( So I layed there and wathced American Idol. Kyle called me again.. then a couple minutes later we got off the phone. Then he called and then we got off the phone and I got in the shower. Got outta that and got on here. Now I'm waiting on my hair to dry so I can straighten it. I'll probably just sleep on it wet and straighten it in the morning. I'm so tired. I still feel sick too. I hope I get better soon.. I dunno why I've been feeling so sick lately. Well I guess I'll leave this entry as is. Leave comments.

Then got Bethany ready and let her go outside and play in the snow =) Then at about 12:45 or so Kyle and I went riding the four wheeler. It was funnnn.. but oh so cold. Burr. Then we went to his grandparents' house to pump up the intertube. Then went out to the golf course and tried sledding. Didn't work too well cause the snow was melting. So then we came back to my house. I was numb. He stayed for about 10 minutes if even that. Then he went home and changed. That was about 3:30. Then he came back over at 5:45. We sat around and mom built a fire. He left at 9 and went to John's. I just now talked to him on the phone and I am about to go finish doing the dishes.

3rd-Learned how to do this one thing. No clue how to do it. Supposed to do it for hw. Screw it lol.
4th-Did another worksheet continued on from yesterday's.
5th-Did a worksheet. Finished it during 7th.

7th-Sat in the gym and did my math homework.
8th-Mr. Smith wasn't there (thank god) so we just talked to whole time.

After school I had detention..with Ms. Bozeman. It was a living hell. I wrote the front and back of a sheet of paper and then the entire front of another. It was completely stupid. Whatever. I'll skip detention if I get it again lol. Sooo then I came home. Ate shrimp with Kyle. =) He had to leave at 6. Then I watched TV. Mom got me chocolate ice cream. =) Yay. Then my dad called and I talked to him. Then Kyle called. Then me and my momma were looking at cabins online! =) Fun fun. Now I'm sitting here updating this and talking to Kyle. I have to pee though so I'll update later. Much loveeee!

I love you Kyle &hearts;"

3rd-Took a quiz.. didn't do too good on it.
4th-Took a test. Did better than I thought I would.
5th-Some worksheet. No clue how to do it. Nor will I ever need to in life.
6th-Got detention and did a worksheet thing.
7th-Learned how to moon walk. WTF i'm not Michael Jackson.
8th-Read and did an assignment.

     Alright. After school Kyle came over. We sat around here for a while. Then we got online to see what movies were playing. The only place we saw White Noise playing was at the Marquee (pullman's square) and it's like $8 to go there so we just decided to go out and eat. We went to Golden Corral. I had a lot of fun. Got stuffed! Then he dropped me off back home. I watched Fear Factor. I put my pajamas on. And now I'm sitting here. 

     Tomorrow I'm not sure what I'm doing. Sarah Beth is going to stay the night another weekend cause she's busy this one =) I'll probably hang out with Kyle!

     Well I reckon that's about it. I'll update this in a couple days or so. I love ya! Leave me comments!

"event","Well I haven't updated for a while. I've just been going to school and hanging with Kyle like usual. =) Yesterday I got sick so I stayed home and today I left school early because no one was there. It was boring. Got home and watched GothikA and then Kyle came over and stuff. Mom made a buncha sweets. Cinnamon hard candy, spearmint hard candy, potato candy, no bake cookies, and fudge. Sent some home with Kyle. Christmas is in 3 days and I'm so excited. Then Kyle's birthday is the day after so that will be fun. I won't get to see him on Christmas so that's when he'll open all his presents and then I think we're gonna go out to eat. If he will.. i wanna take him. Dunno where. Hope he'll like what I get him. So I still need to get my friend's a present but I have no money =( But I guess I'm gonna go. I gotta tinkle =) lol. Leave me comments please. Later loves.

I love you Kyle"

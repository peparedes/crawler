"event","Well it's been months since I've messed with this so I thought I'd make some changes and start updating a little.  I've been pretty busy with baseball and workin out and tryin to hang out with some of my friends...not a bad busy, though, a fun busy.  I do get to talk to Megan once in a while and have some of the goofiest conversations ever so that's cool!  lol  Saturday I went to a wedding reception and had too much to drink, but it was all good.  Kinda left somebody a drunk voicemail but oh well...I'm sure they got a laugh out of it.  I think I'll keep this one short, though, because I don't feel like postin a big one tonight, so I'll talk to you guys later.

-Oh yeah, on a side note...no more fighting!  Especially because of a f'ing livejournal!  Some things can't be controlled...so nobody should be fighting over things like that.  If you feel somebody is neglecting you, then you should enjoy the times you do have with them, not yelling/arguing.  Everybody misses Megan...but we all need to think about her feelings and situation too.  It's just a thought, so don't get mad at me."

"event","It's been a while buds!  I didn't have the link to livejournal anymore after I moved out, plus I was too lazy to look it up, so yeah.  I had to get up earlier than i could've today because I heard a weird noise and looked over just in time to see the puppy chewin on a DVD.  Yeah, needless to say he got smacked.  But not as bad as he did last night.  I got home, looked around, and saw things torn up all over the house.  Alarm clock cord torn into 4 pieces, a Playstation 2 game I payed $50 for a few weeks ago, one of my memory cards, my brothers homework was shredded, and he chewed the computer monitor cord in half.  Luckily we had another cord or I think I woulda killed that fuckin dog.  I already had to buy a new phone charger cuz he chewed the one I had in half.  It's just really agitating...I like Murphy a lot better, he never chews on anything but his toys.  Is it wrong that the only thing I really miss from home is my dog?  lol

So yeah...I'm gonna be goin to Mott this Winter.  Well, most likely anyways.  If I'm on disability, who knows, maybe I'd rather sit and get payed for being lazy lol  Nah, I think I'd rather be up doin stuff.  You guys know how I am...I'm always up and doin somethin.  It sucks havin back problems, I play like every single sport and love doin it, but there's times like this where I can't do shit.  IT SUCKS!  But, odds are, this surgeon I'm seein at the end of the month will do surgery.  So I'll finally get this shit fixed, and I'll be good by the time I'd start at Mott.  Maybe even a little...baseball?  Oh wait, I don't have any talent anymore, DAMMIT!  lol  Oh well, I can always wonder what coulda happened if I didn't get hurt.  :-/

One good thing, though.  I don't worry bout any girl crap anymore.  I always thought I was the problem in terms of girls, but then I guess I gradually realized the truth.  You are who you are, and you need to find someone that can accept you.  And I know I treat girls right, so I don't need to torture myself over anybody.  There aren't many guys that'll actually treat a girl how she deserves to be treated, so I can sit back and watch girls get hurt over and over til they finally start to realize what's important in forming a future with somebody.  So it's all good!  As for you guys, I know you always wanna know who I like lol  So to answer that, nobody in particular.  I look around ya know, I get ideas on who I wanna be with.  But I'm not approaching anybody.  They can talk to me or call me...I won't play the stupid games anymore.  And I've been pretty happy since I've started thinkin like that.

Here's a quote directly from the psychic and it makes a lot of sense:

** The love that is the most beneficial and always touches others is a selfless love.  Caring about somebody but not expecting anything in return.  Expressing your feelings to make THAT person feel better, and not just yourself. **"

What a day, what a day.  It was fun today, I got to see tons of Aunts, Uncles, and cousins I hardly ever see anymore.  And we got goin on old stories...it makes me feel really old.  Things seem like they just happened yesterday but they happened like 10 years ago.  It's ridiculous.  But it was fun...I love cookouts.  And I love the old stories even more.  I can tell the bad things I did back in school and everybody can laugh about it instead of yellin at me.

My bro Bill was over and brought his new puppy, so that was cool.  I love that lil puppy  : )  He named him Riley.  But after everybody left I was hangin out with him and he asked if I wanted to move into the new house with him out in B-Port.  So I talked about it with my parents...and we decided that when I start workin in the next couple weeks, I'm movin out there!  That's gonna be awesome.  No more Birch Run, and I don't plan on moving back to Birch Run again.  I don't like dealing with the politics around here and I wouldn't want my kids to hafta deal with all the shit here.  Are all of the people bad?  No.  I really like some of the people.  But it's bad enough here to the point it just pisses me off a lot of times.  So I'm gonna be moving...and I'll have an awesome pool in my back yard!

So, yeah, I'll be workin 2nd shift out in Millington and living in Bridgeport.  That'll actually be fun.  : )  I plan on switching to 3rd shift around the end of March for baseball season.  That shouldn't be too bad.  Depending on how I like 3rd shift, I might end up staying on it for a couple years.  Besides, you get payed more for 3rd and 2nd shifts.  Money talks.

I hope everybody had a good Labor Day, cuz I sure did.  Other than my autistic cousin letting my retarded dog off his chain, into my new room, let the dog crap in my room, then stepped in it, then didn't clean it up or tell anybody.  BUT HEY, I'll get over it!  I found all of my old movies down in the basement that I haven't seen in YEARS.  Yeah, that's right, I found my old Batman movies and Lion King and Major League and that stuff.  : )   You've GOTTA love those movies.  Plus like the other 12 movies in the box.  I'm set for the next week or so.  But I'm gonna get goin...got some movies to watch.  It's almost 1:15 and I'm not even tired yet.  I'll talk to everybody later.  I'll show ya'll pics of my house-to-be sometime, too.  TTFN  ta-ta for now  (knew you'd like that Cari)

Another ole Monday.  All the days are the same for me, actually.  My Mondays are the same as my Saturdays lol  Kinda cool...but VERY sad.  But it's only a for a lil bit longer cuz I'll be workin here within the next couple weeks, hopefully.

Well, I got up at 1:30 today.  Which is actually kinda early for me.  But anyways, I got up at 1:30.  Then I went downstairs and saw my mom wanted me to do a few things.  So I took a shower and got set for the day.  I went up to Don's and got cat food, then I went up to Wendy's and ate a Big Bacon Classic meal mmmmmm   But when I was at Don's I got a Bananaberry Jones Soda and some hillbilly told me it tastes good with Vodka lol

After I got done with my Wendy's I decided I wanted to go out drivin again.  So I was headin out there and all the high schoolers were pullin out by then.  So when I got on Birch Run Rd. Ben Sheppard was in front of me and gave me a little smirk and started goin 45 to get me to try to pass him lol  So finally no cars are comin, and I take off.  So, of course, he takes off.  I beat him, though, so I was happy.  : )  I was goin 95 lol

Cari and Kaitlin started school today, so I was excited for my buddies  : )   I know it might start out kinda weird because it's a whole new world...but once you get the weekly routine it's 100% better, trust me.  You guys'll be fine!  Megan started her team practices today, too.  Hope that was fun buddy!  Well, I guess practice can't really be fun, but...you know what I mean!  Saw Brian for a lil bit today too when he was getting out of Cross Country.  And I passed Lisa and Sara up town so that was cool, I hardly ever see those guys!   : )

But I'm gonna get goin and eat some Cheez-Its and watch a lil TV.  I'll talk to everybody later!  Leave one if ya want

Haven't posted in a couple days, but that's okay.  Well...maybe it's not, but there's nothin you can do bout it anyways!  : )  My weekend started out really well, nothin but good things.

Went over to the football game Friday and saw a lotta people for the first time since, like, the beginning of the summer.  Then again I saw some people I could go the rest of my life without seein, too.  But that's ok, the good always outweighs the bad.

Mt. Morris really really sucked.  I mean, they sucked BAD.  I think the freshman team coulda beat them.  But, yeah, since the game got delayed until today, I went and saw the second half of it.  They sucked even worse today than they did yesterday.  Wasn't even fun to watch, it was kinda sad.  But I got to see my Vassar kids!  They were over here scoutin a bit.  They beat MLS 46-6 and they have Birch Run next Thursday in Birch Run.  Come out and watch em play...and keep an eye on Vassar's center.  He's f'n huge!

But yeah I got to talk to Brian n Cari n Megan a bit, that was cool.  Hadn't seen em in a while!  Then I went to Exit with Nate, Sandra, and Todd.  Then Nate and Sandra left so me and Todd went over and bugged April, Katie, Cesilie, and Jess for a while.  Fun, fun  : )

So, yeah, things are lookin good...hopefully everyone else is hangin in there.  Later kids!"

One of those so-so days today.  Started out kinda slow, but that's OK.  It coulda started worse...like having to go to Birch Run High School this morning!  :-P   Thank God I'm 2 years outta that place.  2 years...wow...I feel like an old geezer.  But there's no better feeling than driving by and seeing all those cars at the school and knowing that you don't have to be one of the poor souls locked in that prison!  : )

Burned a new cd today...went to Don's and saw my buddy Cari...played a LOT of basketball out on the ole new and improved court.  Gotta love it.  But I decided I'm gonna start running a few miles every day.  So starting tomorrow I'm hittin at least 3 miles a day.  Not bad, eh?

Drumline was on TV today so now I'm addicted and downloading a bunch of college marching band drumlines.  I've got about 5 and I'd say the best out of the bunch is LSU.  It's so awesome.  That kinda stuff blows my mind...how can you do something so fast?

Talked to my buddy Kaitlin...a lot today, actually.  She just loves me cuz I got that lil pic for her!  :-P   And I'm talkin to Megan right now...hey buddy!  I hope I get that $100,000  lol  That's gonna be so awesome, I can't wait.  Oh, and Cari, for your information that Jones Soda I got today was AWESOME so I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE ""PLAH"" YOU GAVE ME!  lol  :-P    Actually I'm not a big fan of it...but that kind is AMAZING!  Bananaberry.  Try it sometime.  It's banana/strawberry.  Really good.

Well kids, I'm gonna head out on that note.  You all take it easy.  Leave me one if you'd like.  : )   G'Bye!

1.  Don't chase shots of whiskey with oatmeal bars.

2.  Don't drink whiskey AT ALL.

3.  A good friendship is more important than anything.

Gotta love the heart-to-hearts with Kaitlin I seem to have every day now.  lol  But oh well, it's nice to know I have people to go with problems.  No matter what that problem is.

Hey Dave, I busted out the Kenny Chesney icon for you.  Thought you'd like that.  Have fun usin' my joke over at Ferris too.  lol  I think me bein' tipsy last night kept you laughin for a bit...I'm weird.  I do remember one thing, IMing Austin Powers and saying ""fuck you for judging me"" and he said that it was very offensive or something?  lol

But yeah kids...I haven't done a whole lot today.  Took Murphy to the vet to get his rabies shot and a license...then watched Hulk on Starz...then took a nap.  :-P   Nothing wrong with bein a little lazy.  I did talk to my buddy Cari this morning!  That doesn't happen every day, considerin' I'm never even up in the mornings anymore.  I don't remember a whole lot about this morning, though...I was really tired.

Well I'm gonna call this one a day...hey to my buddies Brian n Megan too.  Hope your weeks are goin' good.  I'll be around bein' bored, so I'll talk to ya all later.  : )

I give you the new community! - <lj user=""weekly_poetry"">

(I propose) The guidelines will be thus:
Length - any
Subject - any (though it might be fun to have designated weekly subjects/themes later)
Rating - any
Posting day - Wednesday (since Wednesday's child is full of woe, and the great Mr. Eliot was born on a Wednesday)

If you can't post every week, no worries.

What qualifies as a poem? <s>It MUST rhyme!!!</s> Pretty much anything. Blatant prose might get some narrowing eyes, but if it's pretty, I don't care, and I don't imagine anybody else will either. 

It might be interesting to include a tiny bit on why we chose the poem we shared, but I know that the reason isn't always clear or shareable so this can be optional if we want to do it at all. 

I also (also) propose that we have the first posting date next Wednesday, the 15th, to give everyone a week to choose for a poem. If you know people who might be interested in joining, tell them - the more the merrier!

I just watched the tail end of a show in which someone's heart was restarted by the administration of CPR.

HILARIOUS. 

Not only was the CPR <u>very</u> improperly performed, but unless you have some super special electroshock fingers, you cannot restore electrical activity to the heart with CPR. It doesn't magically generate electricity, lol, that's what defibrillators are for. The purpose of CPR is to mimic the pumping action of the heart to keep blood circulating around the body, allowing gas exchange in the lungs and delivery of oxygen etc. to the cells.

<lj-cut text=""Don't Worry, Be Happy"">

1. Hanging out with friends: Been having lots of friend-time lately due to Kat's swiftly-approaching leave-taking. *sniff* The good part of this is that we've been managing to have some quality hanging out, even though summer is over. I feel more loved than ever by that delegation of my life right now. =)  And though I'm sad Kat's leaving for a few months, I'm setting up my Skype and buying envelopes and looking up postage prices, so I don't think it'll be unbearable. *hugs*

2. Being back in school: Though a little overwhelming the first few days, I'm now really glad to be back in school. I guess that's how I know I've picked the right thing to study - I feel capable, challenged, interested, and looking forward to learning. I also feel like my teachers this semester are amazing; they all seem very knowledgeable, very well-practiced, and easy-going, but not when it comes to patient care/safety (which is how it should be). I think they expect a lot from us, and I <i>love</i> that in a professor. So, school = happy (we'll see if I'm singing the same tune in a few weeks).

3. My thesis: A big part of my past foray into depression was the feeling that I wasn't doing anything important, and that I couldn't get interested in anything. With the start of my thesis project, I've felt exactly the opposite. 

4. My dad: My dad's birthday was about a week ago and my sisters and I got him an iPod shuffle. He has been like the most adorable little kid since then. He's always bouncing around whistling or singing an old '50's song or a song he used to sing me when I was little, and he's so excited, lol. After moving out etc., which I know has not been easy on my parents, I like seeing either of them that happy. 

5. Losing weight: I've been pretty disciplined with the doctor's orders, and I've gotten some good results. I don't anticipate any of a loss this week, what with the going out all the time before Kat leaves, but that's alright. There are more important things. =)  At this point, I'm about 20lbs. down from my heaviest, and though I expect it to slow down during the winter (since my appetite in the summer is practically nothing), if I do what I'm supposed to, I think I can keep losing. 

6. New music: Need I say more? It always makes me happy finding new music I like.

7. Feeling appreciated: I've been doing a lot for the BHC lately, and the woman in charge has practically fallen at my feet thanking me. They've also made an effort to add more Nursing/Medicine related lectures to the schedule because of my <s>demands</s> feedback, so even though they still haven't quite grasped the concept of scheduling them when Nursing students don't have class (*sigh*), it was still nice to hear the Associate Dean tell me my comments had changed something. I know we're a small population of students, but hey, we're still important!

8. Someone: Last Sunday was...brilliant. Don't want to talk about it much more than that, but he hardly left my side, and I remembered all the little reasons why <s>I lo</s> I'll miss him.

9. Lucius naps: I've had several very excellent Lucius naps lately, which has served to lessen the stress of starting school again. I think I've mastered the art of making myself have a Lucius nap versus a regular nap - it's fantastic. 

10. Super secret plan: It's a super secret. You can't know it. One of you does know, one of you will know soon, and the rest of you may know after that. =)


This is a pretty good time for me to do this meme - right now I'm in an almost unbelievably happy mood. Strange to look at entries from two years ago, knowing how I felt at that time, knowing the kinds of thoughts that were going through my head, knowing that I believed I would never be this happy again. It feels so long ago, but not so long ago at all (which doesn't make sense, but eh), and I'm happy with the way things have turned out since then."

If you've been here for other <lj user=""hp_tarot""> fics, you know the drill! This is mainly a re-cap for me, to get perspective on my writing style and try to improve, so it's probably more than a little ridiculous to the outside reader, but if you're interested, please feel free to browse! It is highly recommended that you <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/hp_tarot/48981.html"">read the story first</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Words, Words, Words"">

<b>THE CHARACTERS:</b>

<i>Harry</i> - He finally got his shot at being the focus of an hp_tarot fic of mine, lol. For some reason, I had a lot of trouble writing him here. The tarot fics, for me, have always been more about introspection and internal conflict than external conflict, and I think it was harder to portray that in this story because I don't feel it's in Harry's character to do a whole lot of introspection. He does things without considering <u>all</u> the consequences, which is how things got so out of hand with Teddy. This story, like the others, is supposed to take the main character and play the story out through his eyes only - what he feels about something, what he thinks about something, even if it's not happening to him. This was hard to do for Harry because my mindset is so different than his, even though I love his character and understand his motivations. 

ANYway, Harry's conflict in this story is simple - parenting. As Snape remarks (rather viciously) Harry didn't grow up understanding how real, loving parents were supposed to act towards their children. In a way, he doesn't even understand how ""normal"" childrens' minds function because he never had a chance to be a normal child. For him, suffering is bad, end of story. He doesn't want Teddy, his child for all intents and purposes, to have to suffer through life being a werewolf and he is willing to do <i>anything</i> to ensure that doesn't happen. What he doesn't understand is that there are many different kinds of abuse and suffering, and for Teddy, the emotional and psychological hurts he suffered were worse than the physical. Finally at the end, we see Harry mature enough to where he has learned to completely, unselfishly be Teddy's father, doing what's really best for him instead of what <i>he</i> thinks is best for him.


<i>Teddy</i> - I have been told I write children well, but I always feel like my children don't come out nearly the way they should. In any case, Teddy was fun to write because he's a canon character that we know almost nothing about, especially personality-wise. Of course, my love for Remus always makes me picture them to be very alike in personality (even though a lot of Remus's personality is his Pisces nature and Teds is an Aries), but I wanted to bring that out especially in this story. Teddy is going through that phase in his childhood where he is obsessed with his role models. With Harry telling him stories about his dad, a man who Harry himself obviously admired, I can only see Teddy practically hero-worshiping Remus and trying to set up some sort of relationship with him, even if it is one-sided - thus the letter. The story never tells us whether this is the first letter Teddy has written to Remus or not, and that was done on purpose. In my mind, Teddy has more letters scattered about, and he'll tell Harry about them in time, but for now they're a secret between he and his dad.


<i>Severus</i> - He was probably the easiest character to write in this story, which is why I don't think I got him quite right, lol. In any post-DH universe of mine, Severus is always way more chilled out than he has ever been in canon (with good reason, I think). I really didn't want to dwell on his and Harry's relationship, which is why you don't get any backstory about how/why/when they got together, just that they obviously did. In many ways, Severus is a sort of foil for Harry in this story. As Harry points out, he didn't have very good childhood role models either, but like Severus counters, he has raised many children in his time at Hogwarts. I just don't get the feel from him that he would neglect his duties as Head of Slytherin and not care a whit about the kids or try to help them grow up. After all, the Hogwarts kids are there a majority of the year, and the adults that they have teaching them, disciplining them, and watching out for them are their pseudo-parents. Anyway, Severus really doesn't have much development to do in the way of parenting, like Harry does. Yes, he's strict, and yes, he can be mean, but he still makes it clear that he cares through his actions. One can only guess why he's so sweet on 'lil Teds, 'cause he seems to be nicer to him than to most other kids, but I think it's because Teddy's grown up with him from the time he was small, and I'm sure he knows exactly how to squirm his little way into the man's heart by now (just like Harry).


<b>THE CARDS:</b>

With a new set of rules this round, I got the fun of having three cards instead of one. I've seen lots of creative ways of doing this in other fics in this fest, but for me I chose to have them represent the movement of the story.

<i>Five of Pentacles, meaning ""Drained resources; exhaustion; struggling to stay afloat while searching for relief; fighting to keep morale and energy levels up; temporary hardship."" </i> - This card represents most of the plot for obvious reasons. Harry is trying to cure Teddy, but he isn't really prepared for the emotional burden of doing so. 

<i>Ten of Swords, meaning ""Sudden and unexpected failure or disaster; learning from past mistakes; a power beyond your control that humbles you without warning or mercy.""</i> - This card portrays the climax of the story - Teddy's running away. Harry realizes that what he's done to Teddy has driven the boy away, that he's abused him, and possibly lost him forever. He's been so lost in this pipe dream of finding a cure that he hasn't paid any attention to Teddy the child, only Teddy the werewolf. This time in a child's life (he turns seven over the course of the story) is so important for development of self-esteem, and Harry, inadvertently of course, is slicing away at Teddy's self-esteem very badly. I feel like this happens to many parents, especially parents whose children have physical disabilities, medical problems, or some ""flaw"" that they believe needs to be fixed. Children that age only understand one thing about parents trying to fix them - they're somehow broken, not good enough, too much trouble. So this, I feel, would be a very realistic occurrence even outside the Wizarding world, for us poor little Muggles who mess up our kids, lol.

<i> Eight of Cups, meaning ""Turning away; giving up; abandoning a dream; choosing to sacrifice in order to make a clean break and start afresh elsewhere""</i> - This one is obviously the last segment of the story. It's not exactly a happy card, and it's not exactly a happy ending either. After all, Teddy is still a werewolf, and both he and Harry have to deal with that fact, but it represents a sort of maturity in Harry, whereas before he believed he could conquer anything and didn't have to necessarily adapt to new situations. Now, however, he learns that sometimes it is just best to accept that you can't change something and instead make the situation the best it can be. Originally, I wanted the reunion between he and Severus to occur much later, like when Teddy is in his last year of Hogwarts, and have him literally abandon everything to go back to Severus, but that wasn't very realistic, and I liked the idea of Severus having a part in raising Teddy too much to let that happen.


<b>THE REST:</b>

- This fic went awhile without a title. I looked to poems for inspiration, but couldn't really find anything that jumped out and screamed at me. Tentatively, I chose a part of the poem below that I thought fit - <i>Spared the Darkness</i>. Later that same day, I was writing the scene where Harry is finding the letter and I thought it would be way too simple for him to just find it laying on the desk or little table in Teddy's room, so I needed a place for Teddy to hide it. I immediately had the idea of hiding it in a book, but I couldn't figure out which book he would have chosen. I asked my roommate, <lj user=""kittehkat"">, where Teddy would hide a letter to Remus, and it took about a second for her to suggest <i>Goodnight Moon</i>. Of course, I ""awwed"" and told her how beautifully sad that was, lol, and I wanted to put it in the running for the title. Obviously, Goodnight Moon won (but I added a comma, lol).

<i>What I Believe</i> 

I believe there is no justice,
but that cottongrass and bunchberry
grow on the mountain.

I believe that a scorpion's sting
will kill a man,
but that his wife will remarry.

I believe that, the older we get,
the weaker the body,
but the stronger the soul.

I believe that if you roll over at night
in an empty bed,
the air consoles you.

<b>I believe that no one is spared 
the darkness,
and no one gets all of it.</b>

I believe we all drown eventually
in a sea of our making,
but that the land belongs to someone else.

I believe in destiny.
And I believe in free will.

I believe that, when all
the clocks break,
time goes on without them.

And I believe that whatever 
pulls us under,
will do so gently,

so as not to disturb anyone,
so as not to interfere
with what we believe in.

-- Michael Blumenthal


- <i>""There are more important things.""</i>
There's usually a phrase or something that I don't intend to be a recurring theme but becomes one anyway, and in this story, it was the phrase ""There are more important things"". It really embodies the story in a simple way; the important things for Harry change throughout, which is how we can judge the level to which he has matured. In the beginning, Harry's priorities are in the right place, but they're fairly naive - he wants them to be a family and love each other, because if they do that everything will turn out right. As the story progresses, Harry becomes so obsessed with curing Teddy that he forgets that Teddy is a child, a person, and cannot be defined by one factor of his life. In those days, childrens' lives change on a daily basis, and perhaps the least of their worries are their medical problems - it's not what's important to them. So for Harry to be so obsessed with this side of Teddy...well, it didn't do the child any good. Andromeda's accusation, that Harry sees him as the world will see him - as just another Dark Creature - is accurate; he doesn't bother with Teddy the Child, only with Teddy the Werewolf, and that can have very damaging effects on a child's psyche. In the end, however, we see that Harry has his focus back on family and love, but he's not obsessed with having a perfect, pain-free family, he just wants to build one that can work through pain together through love and come out strong.


- I originally intended for there to be a drug-addiction side-plot in this story, and it was going to be the basis for Harry & Severus's break-up. In this version of the story, Harry is ""friends"" with Draco, if in a slightly antagonistic way. Once Teddy had been diagnosed, Harry needed a way to forget about everything that was going on, and Draco gave him that escape in the form of a drug/potion/whatever. Harry's time is either spent wasted or frantically researching trying to make up for time he's lost while being wasted. This is the reason he loses his job and his other friends, and the reason he has so little time for Teddy, and Severus finally finds out and calls him out on it. The line ""'Sorry, Harry. You may have killed the darkest wizard of our time, but I will always be more afraid of Severus than I am of you.'"" was originally intended to be used when Harry goes to Draco after his break-up to get another fix, and Draco refuses him because Severus has threatened him. 

Unfortunately, I ended up feeling like I couldn't really give that plot the attention it needed in this story, so I cut it. The whole concept of addiction sometimes taking hold of a parent/guardian when they are dealing with a child's chronic disease is a fascinating and incredibly complex topic, and I already had enough I wanted to touch on. In other words, I couldn't force it to be a side-plot - it would <i>have</i> to become the main focus, and that wasn't something I wanted to happen with this story. I'm planning another substance abuse story though, and <a href=""http://lotrwariorgodss.livejournal.com/166356.html#cutid1"">I <s>Love</s> <s>Hate</s> Fuck You</a> already deals with that (though in the larger context of a dysfunctional relationship)."

But seriously. I was extremely worried when I heard they were making a movie of it. But the people doing this movie know what the hell they're doing. Everything I could see was <i>exactly</i> like the GN, and of everything, it's the little details, the little clues, the steady little press of an extra weight to keep the tension rising and rising...that's what makes <i>Watchmen</i>. And Rorschach too, of course. But if a clinically psychotic vigilante doesn't make a story, I don't know what does. =) 

Speaking of vigilantes!

What can I really say about <i>The Dark Knight</i>? It was fantastic, of course, as we all knew it would be. Heath was perfect. You don't really see the dedication it takes to play a role like that in very many actors anymore. 

...

Everything there is to say about it has already been said, I think. I'm sure I'll see it a few more times, and maybe have things to add. Right now my mind is screaming '<i>WATCHMEN</i>!!!' at me too loudly for me to think about much else. 
Except how very very much I'll miss Heath.

I find I need to do another list today, so here goes:

1. Finished <i>Watchmen</i> today, and decided I pretty much loved it. If you're into really intriguing characters and plot, definitely <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Alan-Moore/dp/0930289234/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207193964&sr=8-2"">pick this up</a>. Not as fantastic as <i>Sandman</i>, in my opinion, but I still enjoyed it immensely. Daniel, I think you'd like it best.

2. I am now the proud owner of the entire <i>Sandman</i> series *squee*! You have no idea how excited this makes me! Well...simultaneously depressed too, but you know how the Series Blues goes (okay, maybe only Kayte will understand, but still). Got the Lil' Endless storybook too, which is infinitely adorable, though there's far too little Lil!Dream. The art for <i>The Wake</i> actually looks pretty different from the others...but I think I approve...
I guess this solves the question of what I'm going to read next, lol.

3. Something has been REALLY bugging me lately. It's when dumb people try to console themselves in their dumbness by stating snobbily ""Well, book-smart people don't have any common sense or social sense."" Ummm...no. I know plenty of book-smart people who have more social grace and common sense than anyone. Now me, I consider myself relatively book-smart, but I can also handle myself well in social situations, have a nice group of close friends, and I tend to have as much common sense as anyone. STOP PRETENDING LIKE YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING INTELLIGENT. JUST BECAUSE YOU GET FUCKED AND FUCKED UP 2+ TIMES A WEEK DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE BETTER SOCIAL SENSE THAN THE REST OF US. *sigh* Much better.

4. Sitting here staring at my Roland pictures, I'm thinking a re-read of <i>Dark Tower</i> might be in order soon. Hm."

I read the quote they took from him, and I knew right then that it <i>was</i> him! A professor <i>I</i> had was referenced in something. Cool! I mean, I know he's written a few books, but the fact that other people (besides us) had read it - and quoted it! - just makes him shoot up about 10 points in my mind.

<a href=""http://www.narth.com/docs/teensama.html"">Gay Teens, the Boy Scouts, and A.M.A. Policy: Why AMA Policy is Not in the Best Interest of Children or Families</a>

So you won't be enraged/shocked, however, I also suggest taking a look at the top of the page to see where the article was posted before reading it. 

Frightening? Perhaps. One of my biggest questions is: What is ""aggressive treatment"" for Gender Identity Disorder? 

There are a few problems with the studies she cites, namely, assuming that homosexuality <i>in itself</i> is responsible for the ""problems"" they list; say it with me - correlation DOES NOT EQUAL causation! Also, not providing the HIV related data for heterosexual individuals as well - a HUGE flaw in that following argument, since HIV is severely on the rise in the heterosexual population (and come on, clearly the older you get, the more sex you have, the more likely you are to contract an STD, so that rise in percentages isn't really that compelling on its own).

One thing I do give her kudos for is referencing the studies from different countries where there is ""broad and far-reaching tolerance of many forms of sexual deviation"" (O'Leary, 2007) *snicker*.

What <u>should</u> have been done here is another study questioning GBL teens (and adults, where applicable) as to why they experience suicide ideation, or at least what the driving forces are for them. This article is full of assumptions, far far too many for it to be a convincing argument. Even if I hated gay people with every fiber of my being *shudder*, I sincerely don't believe this would have made it into any sort of scientific publication (and I've read a fair few), even though they are trying to pass it off as such. 


On a more selfish note - I find I really enjoy critiquing articles, even ones I agree with! Who knew my HIV project would turn me into such a nerd, lol (oh wait, I knew).


Since I just had an APA workshop today (*groan*), I'll feel remiss if I don't do a ""proper"" reference for the article (this is as proper as I can make it, okay? don't go all handbook on me)

AAAAHHHHH, THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!!!

Okay, deep breaths...now.

I have been trying, in vain, to find another of my favorite childhood music tapes. Here's what I remember - it was one woman singing all the songs (with possible child accompaniment when appropriate), and they were all silly songs. Play list included: Animal Crackers in My Soup, The Witch Doctor song, probably Supercalifragilistigexpialidocius, a song about Silly Pie (Oh me, oh my, have another slice of silly pie!), a song about you wishing you were something besides what you are (Or would you like to swing on a star/ Carry moonbeams home in a jar/ And be better off than you are?/ something something...there were lyrics about a mule, a fish, and a couple other animals), the song about the monkey and the chimp falling in love even though they can only babble to each other, the Name Game song (Megan megan bo-began, banana-fana-fo-fegan, etc.)...

Does this ring a bell to anyone?! I'm seriously losing my mind over here! I need that tape! Well, preferably I need that tape-turned-CD. Point being - I NEED IT! Please dear God, someone tell me this sounds familiar.

<b>ETA: While searching for these songs on iTunes, I came across <i>The Codfish Ball</i> - a song I loved on one of my ""Follow the bouncing ball!"" Disney videos. There were tears, I won't lie.

<lj-cut text=""Please check it out, even if you have no intention of making resolutions this year"">

So, I never make New Year's Resolutions. Never really saw the point. I mean, I have faults, to be sure, and plenty of them, but making a promise to to work on them just because I have to change my calender never seemed very sincere to me. But, I've been thinking a lot about improving the world lately, and I've come to the conclusion that, though I am one small person, there is something I can do.

Each year for Lent, instead of encouraging us to give up things (gum, candy, smoking, whatever), our priests would make a point of encouraging us to DO things (volunteer, pray more, pay more attention to family, etc.). I always saw this as a much more constructive way of approaching the concept of sacrifice. So, that's what I'm encouraging this year!

My challenge to everybody is not to go out and save the world or save a life or anything like that; it's to do something very small. 

<big><big><b><marquee>RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS</big></big></b></marquee>

If you were ever an itty-bitty Girl Scout, like me, you will remember this tradition well. Random Acts of Kindness were HUGE when I was a part of it, and I'm sure they still are. Being a Catholic, I also think of this as ""The Little Way"" of St. Therese of Lisieux, but in no way do you have to practice a particular religion (or any religion for that matter) to practice being a good person. =)

A Random Act of Kindness is exactly what it sounds like - doing something kind for someone else. It doesn't have to be something huge, it doesn't even have to take up that much of your time or energy! Even the littlest things can make a big difference.

Just pick one random act of kindness that will become not so random to you. Make it a habit, as second-nature as taking care of your own self.

My ""thing"" (as my roommate can attest to) is pushing in carts from the parking lot. You've all had it happen - you find an excellent spot to park in a crowded lot and you think 'YES! I am so clever to have found this space!', and then you go to park in it and your pride is smashed. <i>Your</i> space is occupied. By a fucking cart. Why? Because someone was too lazy to walk 20 feet to the cart return space and put it back. You are deeply enraged. You can't get out and move the cart because there are already 5 people waiting behind you, and that woman in the minivan looks like she's about to take out her son's new bee-bee gun and test it out on you. Ouch. So you sigh morosely and go park a half a mile away.

Having been both a former retail worker who has had to push these carts in after a very long day at work, and the person who can't park in their God given space because of someone else's laziness, I cannot stand to leave carts in the parking lot. If I see an abandoned one? I push it in. Two, three? Push those in? When it hits four, I usually have to ask Kat to help me, lol. But she does it, which is why I heart her.

No, you will probably never meet the people you help. Yes, they could be total jerks. Yes, they could be those people who cut you off on the freeway and rear-end you and flip you off. But they could also be those people who have children in the hospital dying, or people just waiting for life to give them a break, or people who needed that one little kindness to keep them from going overboard.


<b>Examples of Random Acts of Kindness:</b>
-- Pick up fallen items in retail stores. 
-- Get rid of that loose change you hate - give expired parking meters an extra ten minutes or so.
-- See some not completely disgusting trash laying near a trash can? Go on, put it in there. Bonus points if it's gross. Extra bonus points if it's not near a can and you pick it up anyway.
-- In line at the drive-thru? Pay for the person behind you (if you can spare the cash, of course).
-- Leftover food from restaurants can be a great meal for someone who doesn't have anything to eat. But a word of caution: Depending on your situation, this can be dangerous - make sure you are careful when approaching strangers (of ANY kind, not just less fortunate people), and it's better to practice this one with a buddy and a cell phone (and possibly your WOC).
-- Pedestrians - I know you have the right of way, but you don't have to use it. Long line of cars? Step away from the corner and turn your back to the intersection so they'll know you're not going, then walk when you're not so much of a bother. =)
-- If you can, clean up spills. I'm not talkin' vomit or suspicious liquids here, but maybe a melted ice cube. 
-- See someone struggling with items in a store? Offer to get them a basket.


<b>Examples of Things That Are More Just Proper Manners, But Can Be A Good Starting Point:</b>
-- Hold the door open for others. Yes, every time.
-- You learned ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" when you were very little. Use them. Yes, every time, even if it seems redundant (the ""But it's their job"" excuse is deplorable).
-- Clean up after yourself, even at fast food restaurants. Crumbs? No. Scoop them up and put them on your plate.
-- Someone drop something close to you? Help them out.
-- If you like to spit your gum out where other people can step on it, please stop it.

And, of course, you can come up with your own! There are hundreds of things you can do that make other peoples' lives easier, and you don't have to plan it out in advance - if you see someone in need, help out. Every little thing you do has the potential to make someone's day.

Here are some amazing websites that you can also take a look at:
~ <a href=""http://www.actsofkindness.org/index.asp"">The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation</a>
~ <a href=""http://www.forbetterlife.org/"">The Foundation for A Better Life</a> - <i>My new favorite (completely G-rated) website</i>


If anybody decides to participate, I'd love to know about it! Leave me a comment, do whatever you like, and remember, the resolution to be a better person doesn't have to start on January 1 - it can start whenever you make the commitment! Just pick one and make it a habit, and we'll work together!"

It is highly recommended that you <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/hp_tarot/33825.html"">read the story first</a>.****

<lj-cut text=""AUTHOR'S NOTES"">

-- I chose to separate the story into six different parts because of the card number (clever, yeah? *eyeroll*). Each number is a week, though not necessarily at the same time every week (ONE starts with the first day, whereas THREE ends on the last day). I was going to explain this, but it would have taken away from the vague feeling I was trying to go with.

WHY THIS FIC:

-- I <i>needed</i> to write something like this after <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, even if I never put it out into fandom. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, and there's little I would change about it, but I was a bit traumatized by all the Snape revelations. I just felt so so bad for him, imagining him practically forcing isolation on himself, constantly living in a world of guilt and regret, never able to truly forget his past because Harry was the constant reminder that his love chose another man. *mourns*

Anyway, I needed to make myself feel better about it - I needed to give him happiness and hope. I gave him some extra memories of her, to make their friendship seem more real, closer, because after all, they're supposed to be best friends. Why wouldn't they spend their summers together? Snape hated his home and Lily's sister wasn't too keen on her - they were probably the only Hogwarts students for miles and miles, and all they would have had was each other. JKR mentioned in an interview that Lily may have even come to care for Severus romantically, and everyone knows how school-aged crushes go; I'm sure she did think about him that way one time or another. I needed the canon to be deeper, to ""make sense"", to be...well...Snapeish. Hello plot-bunny!

THE PROMPTS:

-- <i>""A card of the past and memories, things that have vanished."":</i> This was what first drew me in to the card. I had really been looking for the sort of fic I could write good gen for, with all sorts of non-relationship related woes - I figured memories would be a good way to accomplish that.

-- <i>Dreams of idealized childhood.:</i> This prompt was where the story began. It was originally both Harry and Snape-centric, because I really wanted to focus on Harry and the way that his ideal childhood would unfold (the original idea for the curse). But alas, with the release of <i>Deathly Hallows</i> and the subsequent dumping in my lap of all sorts of lovely juicy Snape canon, the focus shifted from Harry to Snape. I kept all my original ideas for memories in there, they just end up being the memories viewed by Snape and not from Harry's own point of view.

-- <i>Reversed - Nostalgia, inability to face reality. Reversed, this card warns of the dangers of constantly looking back, living in the past, yearning for all that is gone and never to return. It could indicate hiding in the past to escape facing up to current problems which need attention.:</i> This was a prompt I chose after doing more research on the card. I wanted it to start out this way, reversed, and then gradually move to the understanding of the true nature of the card, which is acceptance of the past and looking (not dwelling) on memories. I knew the fic was going to center more around Snape at this point, and it seemed like this is what he had done all his life - been too focused and guilty about the past that he couldn't move on. I felt so so bad for him after that, I had to give him the ability to move on with his life and <i>live</i>.


THE CHARACTERS:

-- Severus: Obviously, the main character and the focus of the plot. I sobbed through the Prince's Tale in <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Which is why I was incredibly upset to return to fandom and find people bashing on him, saying how pathetic he was, and how this made him all shallow and annoying, and how much they hated JKR for making this the ""Secret of Snape"". Severus and Lily IS the love story of <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, not Harry/Ginny, not Ron/Hermione. He gave up everything he had, his freedom, his happiness, his pride, just to ensure that she would stay safe and happy, even if it meant she wasn't with him. His love wasn't obsessive either; it may have began that way, when he was a little boy who was just starved of affection, but to keep loving her, even after she was gone, for nearly twenty years after she was gone is not obsessive love, it's true love. 

I really wanted to show that with this story. I think JKR did as well as she could with their story in the limited amount of time she had, especially when she was still trying to keep the focus on Harry. Any more of the S/L story in <i>DH</i> would have been dragging people away from the main hero's journey, so I'm glad she didn't do it. But seriously, we need a bit more than that (extra book? yes, please). I struggled with bringing him back to life as well, because it takes away his tragic character status. I mean, sure, he still has had a tragic life, but without a tragic end, he isn't a real tragic character. But it had to be done, for the sake of my muse, lol.

-- Harry: 'Lil Harrykins took a backseat in this fic, which was something that I really never intended to happen. But I think, after <i>DH</i>, he has matured so much, that he really didn't need the same amount of healing that Snape did. He's basically come to terms with the fact that his parents/parental figures are dead, and though he was in the curse for a longer period of time, he doesn't have the deep emotional wounds that Severus has, so it's a bit easier for him to get over everything. What I really wanted to convey most about Harry is what I would feel his new attitude towards Snape would have been, were the man still alive after <i>DH</i>; it's more than just forgiveness, it's also a sense of camaraderie, because they both share grief over the same person, and they both had relatively similar childhoods - they can relate well to one another, now that they've buried the hatchet.  


THE FLOWERS:

-- The typical art on the '6 of Cups' card is of a boy giving flowers to a little girl (there are typically six flowers). I really wanted to incorporate this somehow, and at first I thought of it being Harry out with his little sister in one of his curse-dreams. But that idea got smashed, lol. I was having difficulty in writing the scene where Snape is at Lily's grave, because I really wanted him to convey a lot of emotion in a very Snape-like way (using as few words as possible, lol). So finally I thought, 'What better way than with something symbolic, like flowers?'. Boom. 

Though he pretty much internally states the meanings of all the flowers he chooses, here they are again: Hyacinth (purple) - ""please forgive me""; Carnation (striped) - ""sorry I can't be with you""; Daisy - ""loyal love""; Daffodil - ""unrequited love"". I think the Forget-me-nots are pretty self-explanatory. I know you're thinking 'But that's only five flowers!' - he also gives a lily to James, thus six flowers.


-- There were a few scenes directly inspired by songs, and here's where they get their due**:

<i>The Park Scene & The Window/'American Pie' Scene:

<big>Every Now & Then</i></big> - GB

I walked down to the park last night
Warm breeze stirrin' up a soft moonlight
And my mind started driftin' 
To way back when
Yes, I do think about you
Every now and then

I heard a song on the radio just yesterday
The same one you always asked me to play
And when the song was over 
I wished they'd played it again
Yes, I do think about you
Every now and then

<i>The Graveyard Scene:

<big>Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again</i></big> - Phantom of the Opera

You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered

Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could.

Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?

Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye.
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try

No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye.

**ALL LYRICS ARE PARTIAL

-- These songs didn't really feature in the story, but I took pieces from each to help craft the mood (you'll probably recognize certain phrasing from the fic)**

<i>(This is how I see Severus and Lily's final fight in its emotional terms - I think it fits very well)</i>

<i><big>Make This Go On Forever</i></big> - Snow Patrol

Please don't let this turn into something it's not
I can only give you everything I've got
I can't be as sorry as you  think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinkin' throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
The splintered mast I'm holdin' on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason
To make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time 
That I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you taught me
To look past everything I had ever learned
The final word in the final sentence
You ever uttered to me was 'love'

We have gone through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore?
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes


<i>(Somehow, this song always has a place in my stories that focus on introspection and change - instead of smut, lol. It's a very </i>real<i> song.)</i>

<i><big>I'm Movin' On</i></big>

I've dealt with my ghosts and 
I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I found you find strength 
In your moments of weakness
For once I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame, 
Trapped in the past for too long
I'm movin' on

I'm movin' on
At last I can see
That life has been patiently
Waiting for me
And I know
There's no guarantees
But I'm not alone
There comes a time
In everyone's life
When all you can see
Are the years passin' by
And I have made up my mind
That those days are gone

I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up
On my way outta town
I've loved like I should
But lived like I shouldn't
And I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me 
Somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on


<i>(I think this song sums up their last few years pretty well)</i>

<i><big>I Who Have Nothing</i></big>

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you, and want you so
I'm just a no one
With nothing to give you
But oh, I love you

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear when I say
That he can give you the world
But he'll never love you
The way I love you

He can take you anyplace he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
Where I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the windowpane

I, I who have nothing
I, I who am no one
Must watch you
Go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms
Of somebody else
When, darling, it's I
Who loves you
I love you


<i>(THIS is how love is for Severus - painful and powerful)</i>

<i><big>Hallelujah</i></big>

Maybe there's a god above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone
Who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken
Hallelujah

"event","Hey. Hey guys. Are you close to a bookstore? Or are you close to your computer and have the ability to type in www.amazon.com? Excellent. Because every single person in the entire world should read this book.

It's called <i>Happy Cruelty Day</i> by Bob Powers, and I cannot remember ever laughing so hard in all my life (which is a pretty big deal for me). There's a short entry for each day, detailing the ""holiday"" that that day commemorates. For example:

<i>March 19 - Anybody Remember to Cut Himself a Piece of ""I'm a Filthy Whore"" Cake Day!

Carvel might not have these on display. But trust me, they sell 'em.

Now come on, for God's sake. You work hard all day pawning away all those pieces of yourself into which you might have invested just a little bit of pride. You run the hustle and you skim the till. You lie and you scam and in the end you'd partake in a haggle over the asking price for your baby's asthma pump. When you walk past a church, nuns shout, ""There he is!"" and then they run out to the sidewalk to kick you in the genitals. Whether you're selling the land out from under an assisted-living facility to make way for a parking lot or you're in the truck stop ladies' room from 10:00 P.M. till 2:00 A.M. performing oral sex for crystal meth, you're a filthy whore and you're way fucking good at it. It's time you got some goddamn cake.

Sorry, but I'm sick of this shit. My dad was given a cake last September just because he turned sixty-eight. And here you are sanding away at every characteristic of your person that might designate you a member of the human race as opposed to, well, a ""cunt,"" and do you get a cake? Sure, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association was good enough to put your face on a poster that reads: GOD MAY HAVE TAKEN OUR VISION, SO FUCK GOD. BUT THIS GUY MADE IT SO WE CAN'T BRING OUR DOGS INTO GROCERY STORES, SO DOUBLE-MOTHERFUCK THIS GUY! But did they give you a cake? The blind don't know how to party.

Happy Anybody Remember to Cut Himself a Piece of ""I'm a Filthy Whore"" Cake Day! Now get your hand out of my pocket, shitbag.</i>

Other gems include:
Covet Children at a Playground Day!

Try to Make Shit Happen With Your Mind Day!

Police Chase Past Your Girlfriend's House Day!

Do Laundry Until You Get Fucked Day!

Pornography Makes You a Better Person Day!

When You Overturn the Hyundai at Tonight's Race Riot, Make Sure Chicks Are Watching Day!

Don't Masturbate to the Love Letters You Found in Your Dead Mother's Closet Day!

Come Out of the Closet As Something Society Thinks is Shameful Day!

and...

Empty the Biggest Room in Your House of All Furniture and Decoration, Then You and Your Mate Strip Naked and Scowl at Each Other Day!


There's 400 pages of this gloriousness, guys. It's. Fucking. HYSTERICAL. And depressing. But more hysterical than depressing. READ IT. Also check out the website - <a href=""http://www.happycrueltyday.com/"">here.</a>

(Though this is probably another one of those times when all my friends will give me ""that look"" and scoot a little bit farther away from me, and I know our friendship will never be quite the same again, this book is good enough to take that risk. And if you're one of those friends, you're just boring.)

(Oh, God. This is gonna be just like that time I brought the poster of the abstract, bodiless babies into my English class, isn't it? Damn.)"

"event","Okay, funny story, lol. So Kat's been bugging me for about a month and a half to apply to <lj user=""hogwarts_elite""> since she's had a blast with all her Hufflepuff friends she's made. Finally I relented, got past my fears of being Squibbed, and started working on the extensive application.

I've always been a self-proclaimed Gryffindor, but lately I've been finding more and more in common with the other houses, so I really had no clue where I was going to be sorted. As I started answering the questions, I kept switching back and forth, usually between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and kept listening to Kat's stories about the other houses and how it was hard to get into such and such house, or how everyone in such and such house was a certain way. 

Finally, I started to get the feeling with the way I was answering questions, not necessarily the answers themselves, that I knew where I was going to be sorted. I told Kat so, and she said (quite disdainfully, lol) that she thought she knew too, and that she would never speak to me again if I was sorted into <i>that house</i> (keep in mind, neither of us had yet to mention the house name out loud). 

Some us-typical bickering followed and culminated in me throwing a hairbrush at her from across the room (if you know Kat, this is <b>BAD</b>, lol), then she came at me with a pair of scissors! There was a slight scuffle, which was much less a scuffle than a mutual moment of retardation in which she hit her foot (really hard, she totally has a bruise) on my chair while lunging in at me, and I hit my head on the wall trying to escape her. We both burst into fits of giggles and ""owww!""s after which we both admitted that we were probably too ridiculous to fight each other. Which is why we make the best roommates ever!

*palmface* Go on, tell us how ridiculous we are."

"event","Okay, I just saw The Nativity Story at the movie theater and I must say: Mary/Joseph = my new OTP. Lol, they were SO CUTE, and their little understated love story was the sweetest thing I've seen in a long time. The three magi were hysterical - they all lived together by themselves in this palace and were like three old men bickering with and nagging each other. Awesome. And of course, baby Jesus is the cutest baby ever. And it's very realistic, in terms of ages (Mary being much younger than Joseph) and science and period-clothing and the situations they had to face. All in all, an excellent movie, especially for those of you celebrating Christmas, but even if you're not a Christmas-person, it's still a great movie. Go see it!"

It only took a week, and that makes me extremely excited. Though I did still have internet access over the week, it's not the same. I heart you Lappy. 

And in other exciting news! In 834 days, I will finally see, (on the big screen, not just in my own mind) what I consider to be one of the most melt-worthy scenes in canon ever since my lucious discovery of fight-smut. My second-favorite-pureblood, covered in blood, <i>guh</i> - sounds delicious. I'll probably still be recovering from OotP, so it'll be nice therapy...even though technically it's one of the more angsty/heart-breaking scenes. Whatevs. It's still gonne be hot, and I only have to wait a little over two years to see it!

Now that the morbid turn is over, I'm soo happy to be going back to school next week. Ugh, I never ever want to live at home over the summer again. Finding an apartment downtown, however, is probably going to be quite expensive, so I don't know how that's going to turn out. Hope everyone had a good summer!"

Wow. I haven't sobbed like that over something I've read probably since DT VII. I had to force myself to stop reading it. It was awful. I couldn't even read something else that he was in. I've decided there are pretty much only four people that I'll cry over if they die in book 7 - Harry, Draco, Snape, and Remus. Maybe Neville. Everyone else can kick the bucket for all I care. If I have to read another Draco-suicide like the one I just read, I'll never finish, I'll throw it across the room and burn it the first chance I get. And by that I clearly mean I'll throw it across the room and stalk away only to come back the next day ready for a good cry and start reading again, lol. That's me - sobbing over fictional characters - it might be what I do best!
</lj-cut>

So, apparently the Lappy might be out of commission for a couple weeks. I dunno what I'm gonna do. Probably die. Yes, it's going to suck measles viciously. And believe me, nobody likes sucking measles.

*EDIT*: The last thing on my mind before I went to sleep, the first thing I thought of this morning, and I wouldn't go into a bathroom that had a tub in it. But at least I didn't dream about it! And the forcing myself to stop reading? Yeah, that lasted about 20 minutes. What can I say - I'm a masochist."

"event","Okay, just 'cause I love this show and this made me laugh for like 5 minutes (and I was writing slash at the time) I have to put this quote here.

<b>**Insert friendly disclaimer here about how I don't hate gay people and neither does God**</b>

""It's okay, Shake, 'cause whoever you decide that you are, I still am gonna love you. But just not in a gay way. 'Cause God makes all people different sizes and shapes and problems, but He only makes the people He hate gay. That's you, you it boy, you gay!"" 

A little while later... ""Look, the right thing to do is to accept him for his difference. Or, you could just cut his head off and hide the body in the desert. That'd be different."""

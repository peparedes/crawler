"event","eve 6- inside out
I would swallow my pride I would choke on the
rhines But the lack thereof would leave me
empty inside I would swallow my doubt turn it
inside out find nothing but faith in nothing
Want to put my tender heart it in a blender Watch
it spin round to a beautiful oblivion Rendezvous
then I'm through with you I burn burn like a
wicker cabinet chalk white and oh so frail I see
out time has gotten stale The tick tock of the
clock is painful All sane and logical I want to
tear it off the wall I hear words and clips and
phrases I think sick like ginger ale My stomach
turns and I exhale So Cal is where my mind
states but it's not my state of mind I'm not as
ugly sad as you Or am I origami Folded up and
just pretend demented as the motives in your
head I alone am the one you don't know you
need me take heed feed your ego Make me blind
when your eyes close sink when you get close
tie me to the bedpost. 

""As The World Falls Down""

There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes.
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes.
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes.

There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams.
A love that will last
Within your heart.
I'll place the moon
Within your heart.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down.

Falling.
Falling down.
Falling in love.

I'll paint you mornings of gold.
I'll spin you Valentine evenings.
Though we're strangers 'til now,
We're choosing the path
Between the stars.
I'll leave my love
Between the stars.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down.

Falling
As the world falls down.
Falling
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Makes no sense at all.
Makes no sense to fall.
Falling
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down.

""Good""

Looking around the house.
Hidden behind the window and the door.
Searching for signs of life but there's nobody home.

Well, maybe I'm just too sure.
Maybe I'm just too frightened 
by the sound of it.
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said, 

[CHORUS:]
Aha, it was good living with you. 
Aha, it was good.
Aha, it was good living with you.
Aha, it was good.

Sitting around the house, 
watching the sun trace shadows on the floor.
Searching for signs of life, but there's nobody home.

Well, maybe I'll call 
or write you a letter.
Now, maybe we'll see on the Fourth of July.
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud.
Well, I'm not too sure and I'm not too proud to say.

[CHORUS:]
Aha, it was good living with you. 
Aha, it was good.
Aha, it was good living with you.
Aha, it was good.

[spoken:] 
Yeah, you were so good.yeah you were so good, yeah that's right..."

"event","i came to a incredibly depressing relization just a few moments ago. 
i dont know what has happened. what happened to how it was. its been so long since i've had a conversation like i used to have all the time. so long since i've had a really deep conversation thats a little weird and doesnt exactly make sense but one that i wont forget. like the conversation katie and i once had about stars and eyes and just all this shit where we got so symbolic with every thing. its like the things you think but dont say because you dont always know how. i used to have such amazing conversations with people and i just dont have conversations like that any more. dont get me wrong cause i do love conversations that i have (like with you sam) but its not the same. guys or girls or petty arguments are subjects of so many of my conversations. i've had a lot of coversations about absolutly nothing!!! that used to be one of the biggest annoyances to me. such small talk. why? what has changed so much that i dont do what was once one of my favorite things in the world. what happend to my conversations? is it that i dont talk to the people i used to? is it that katie and i have so much going on that we are no longer apart of? we used to talk forever before she left. i'm close to tears thinking that maybe i won't have a conversation like that with all the new friends i have these days. so much has changed in my life. i remember when i hardly lived in this world. when i walked in dreams and books and i tried so very hard just to escape reality it seems. i dont sketch in my sketch book as often as i did. i cant remeber all my dreams like i used to. i dont...understand where i turned so sharp. i dont write poetry like i used to. i dont cut out eyes from magazines any more. i dont know what happened to my lyric book. i havent gone out into the woods alone in so long. i havent gone out of my way to watch the sun set in so long i cant remember the last time i did! i've changed so much, some are good changes, but these are bad...no...these scare me. these help me flinch at my reflection at night. i dont recognize myself like i once did. i dont get lost in my imagination like i used to. please dont tell me that this is getting older!! please dont tell me this is me growing up!!!! i wanna go back when i could get lost in a book for hours on end and write pages and pages of nonsense i wanna talk to somebody and afterwards feel like ive uncovered secrets about life!!!!!!! i want a really conversation..."

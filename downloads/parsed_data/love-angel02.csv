"event","Hey guys...I know I'm getting really lazy about this journal thing. I haven't had much time lately..of course I've already told you that. 

Umm...my doggies got over their parvo...well Priss did. They sent her home 2 weeks ago and she came home bouncin' off the walls. They sent Squidge home a week later and he wasn't doing so well. He acted like he did from day one. Just laid around...acted like he was starving to death and we'd feed him and he'd throw it back up. Dad got up to go to work and was eating chicken or somethin...he fed him a few pieces later and he threw that up. Well about 9:30 I called the vet and told him what he was doing. He got mad because I made him go back to the office. When we got there he was really hateful. He checked him out and asked what he'd eaten. I told him about the chicken and he bitched at me all the way out the door. He said ""you don't feed a dog human food! You already tried to kill the other dog by feeding it that and I don't want this one to die so I'll keep him here to make sure he stays alive."" I just kinda looked at him. He hurt my feelings. Now I'd like to know who out there doesn't feed their dog scraps?? It won't hurt 'em. He kinda pissed me off but what could I do. He sent him home to die is all I can figure. He kept him about a week and the nurses said he could come home on Monday...which was yesterday.

I tell you what, yesterday was the worst day of my entire life. *sigh* Sunday morning Tim (the vet) called and said Squidge was doing really bad. He had developed an ulcer from the parvo and it had ruptured. That's why they kept him so long. He said he'd see how he was that afternoon but he didn't think he was going to make it. I cried and cried. Well yesterday morning Tim called and said he had to put Squidge down. That started off my great day. When I got to work I had to unload the truck and when I went out to spot the paper, I took a box off of the top and the whole cart fell on top of me. I just sat down and cried and cussed with all I had in me. After that I was putting up the candles and dropped the box and broke 7 out of 12 of them. Yeah that didn't bother me so bad. After I got off work me and Scott went to Gate City and ate. On my way home from Scott's I had noticed there was a car behind me. Well I was minding my own business...going pretty slow because it was foggy and about 4 miles from my house this deer walks out in front of me. I tried to stop but then didn't because the road was wet and I knew I'd kill myself if I tried to stop that fast. I hit it. It went flying over my car and the car behind me ran over top of it. I didn't know who it was or if it hurt them so I turned around...turns out it was my sister. lol she was on her way home with her man....*sigh* thank God. All it did to my car was knock half of my bugflector off the hood...dented the hood pretty bad, bowed it up and scratched off the paint. That's about it. I lost my license plate frame and my tag was hanging by one screw....that was the perfect ending to a perfect day. I'm glad it's over.

On a lighter note...how was everyone else's day? that made me feel better to vent a little so I guess I'll go to bed now...maybe I can sleep tonight."

"event","Hey everybody :) It's me again. I've been really really busy and haven't had a chance to even get online. My puppies are both sick with parvo :( I took them to the vet...one of them is better but the other one doesn't look so good. *sigh* I don't know...I miss him and it really hits me when I walk through the door and don't get my usual greeting. But Priss is home now and hyper as she always was....just hope he gets better.

I finally got my promotion at work. Lots of things have been going on there lately. Money disappearing and reappearing...people setting people up. Can't prove a thing though. The district manager pretty much said that our manager could take money from a cashier and leave for the evening, bring it back the next day and not a thing anybody can do about it. It's the closing manager's fault the money is missing. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. Of course I'm not accusing anybody of anything until I have proof but I  pretty much know who's doing what and why. They just think I'm stupid and can't figure it out. The one being set up knows what's going on too. It's just a matter of timing I guess.

But on a lighter note...how's everyone in livejournal land? I miss everybody and haven't talked to you guys in forever. Leave me some comments and let me know what's going on!"

"event","Well...I sure am slacking on this journal thing. I used to update 3 times a day and now I update 3 times a year. Sorry guys I've been pretty busy with the job and everything. It still sucks but I'm full time now and already qualify for 40 hours vacation...woo hoo. Pretty soon I'll be a keyholder and that'll probably suck more than what I'm doing now. That's life though...gotta do something I suppose.

So how is everyone? Things are good here. Still listening to my parents fight over stupid crap but what else is knew. If they didn't fight, they wouldn't even talk. 

I should be off all weekend and I have no idea what I'm gonna be doing. We thought about renting a cabin on the lake or something. I'm still waiting for my surprise he promised me. :) I don't know what it is but I wish he'd hurry up and get it. It's probably a fishing pole or something..lol my little fisherman. *sigh* I love him. He's my whole world. We haven't spent much time together in a while because of my stupid schedule. I hate to work the evenings and I think he knows it...that's why he makes me work them. Asshole...he pisses me off sometimes. He told me I was in training...I think he thinks I'm stupid. I've worked all evenings going on 2 years...I think  I've had enough training wouldn't ya say?

Well I guess I'll get off of here and get ready for work. Not much to say and when I talk about work I guess it's time to shut up anyways. See you guys later."

Things are going pretty good for me. Still gots my job at the Dollar Store...I really hate that place. Wouldn't be so bad if me and my boss got along. I told him yesterday I hated him because he's an asshole. He looked kinda surprised though I couldn't imagine why considering I never speak to him. *sigh* I don't know...don't care really. As soon as I find a better job I won't be there. But on the plus side, I'm off today. Guess it could be worse.

Me and Scott are still together :) 2 1/2 years and we're still doing great. I love him :) We're still looking for a house and as soon as he pays off his truck we're gonna buy one. I can't wait :)

Well I guess that's about it...Not much else to tell...so leave me some comments and let me know how you guys are!"

Not a whole lot of fun but it'll look good on my paycheck :) Standing for 9 hours straight doesn't feel too great but I suppose I'll get used to it. I was only supposed to work 5 hours but he called me in early. I had a pretty good day. I saw quite a few people I knew...I didn't do anything but talk all day. 

There are some stupid people in this world...just a random thought. I hate people lol they piss me off.

I've learned that you cannot make
someone love you. All you can do is
stalk them and hope they panic and give in.

I've learned that no matter how much I care,
some people are just assholes.

I've learned that it takes years
to build up trust, and it only takes
suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.

I've learned that you can get by
on charm for about fifteen minutes.
After that, you'd better have a big willy
or huge boobs.

I've learned that you shouldn't
compare yourself to others - they are
more screwed up than you think.

I've learned that you can keep vomiting
long after you think you're finished.

I've learned that we are responsible
for what we do, unless we are celebrities.

I've learned that regardless of
how hot and steamy a relationship is at
first, the passion fades, and there had better
be a lot of money to take its place.

I've learned that 99% of the time when something
isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it

I've learned that the people you care most
about in life are taken from you too soon
and all the less important ones just never go away.

I've learned to say ""F--- 'em if they can't take a joke""
in 6 languages."

I really like it though. When it gets busy...it gets busy. All at once but I've finally learned all about the register. Didn't really take me all that long. Not that you care...I just thought I'd share.

Kandice has really had something in her ass all day. I'm convinced she hates me. She's been nothing but a smartass to me all day...when she was done she thought she could use me to take her to Goody's. Nope...i'm not Jacob...she's not gonna use me like she does him most of the time. I get sick of a whole lot of shit with her. I did absolutely nothing to her today.

I don't think I asked for much...I really don't. I'm usually here when she wants me to drive her somewhere and I wait on her while she's at Paul's house ""asleep"" or whatever it is she's doing. But she can't do one little thing I ask her. She bitched at me on the way out the door because I asked for a favor. F*ck It. I do'nt care anymore. I'm just gonna remember that when she wants something. I would do that for her...actually i have before. Oh well...I knew she wouldn't return the favor. Screw it. It's just annoying. I guess it's no big deal but me and Scott  NEVER get any time alone anymore...never. It hurts my feelings that she wouldn't help me out. Oh well...I guess I kinda expected it.

So anyways, I'm still waiting to hear from the Dollar Store...I really need that job. I don't know if I'll get it or not...but I guess your'e tired of hearing about it so I'll shut up.

So how's everyone?? I feel completely anti-social anymore. I never get a chance to talk to anyone. I guess I talk to the ones I want to but some of which I can't. That's one of the reason's I miss high school...my friends. That's life though :) Well I believe I'm gonna get off of here and clean up the house. Bye bye :)"

HOw was everybody's day??? Mine was okay I suppose. I got up this morning and turned my application in. I hope I get the job cuz I really want it. I'm pretty sure I will...I was the only one that turned in an application so yeah...I'm hopin :) I'm broke and need some money. 

I miss my doggie :( I know it seems pretty cruel what happened but there were lots of houses around and I'm sure someone is taking care of her or she'll come back. She always comes back...she's been gone for a week before and came back home. It's better having her with someone else than having the neighbor shoot her for eating cats. I don't really like that woman...she's very odd. She stays in her house all the time with her animals and only comes out to walk her dog that wears a sweater and a cast now because it ""slipped a disk"". Maybe I'm just weird because I don't do that...I don't know.

I talked to Kirb today. I miss her :( She's my bestest friend in the whole wide world and I don't get to talk to her very much anymore.

The neighbor called this morning bitchin' at us because our dog is eating her kittens. So we had to get rid of her. :( I loved that doggie. Me and Scott took her for a ride in his truck this evening and she jumped out of the back...which is what mom wanted her to do...so she did. Scott floored the gas and she was running with all she had trying to catch up to us. All I could do was cry :( IT was so sad. I didn't wanna get rid of her b/c she's the best dog we'd ever had.

They pissed me off then, I'm sure they'd piss me off now.

My entries are kinda depressing lately. Sorry about that. Lots of bad things have happened to me this week. I think it was pick on Kelli week or something. I've been upset everynight for the past 4 nights. I guess it's stupid stuff that bothered me but I can't help being emotional sometimes. I hate fussing with Scott. We don't do it often but when we do I feel so horrible. Nothing that he said or did or anything...well not always...I just feel bad for fighting with him. It's always over something stupid. I dont' know....I love him so much and I don't ever want to have to live life without him. I've FINALLY found my soulmate :) I'm sure of it.

Thought I found it before but lol that was a joke. Things change...people change. I didn't think I would ever find someone that could make me feel the way <i>he</i> did.

If they're not lying to me..they're lying on me. Just gets old. If you dont' want to do something, say so. Do'nt make up a bunch of b.s. to get out of it. It's really not that hard. We're not completely stupid. Yes I do have a tendency to hurt people's feelings, but I'm not gonna sugarcoat things just to spare feelings. That's one thing I""ve learned over the past few years, you have to stand up for yourself because no one else is going to. If it hurts people's feelings then so be it. The truth hurts sometimes. Other's are afraid to express their opinion but I just don't care anymore. I really don't. Why should I? They don't care. Up until my senior year in high school I never once stood up for myself. I would let things build up inside then eventually blow up...sometimes at the wrong people but I'm not ever gonna be that way again. Like it or not. I can't help it.

Nothing's wrong...just kinda...I don't know...worried/scared/depressed all rolled into one. I guess I should'nt be...but I am and I can't help it. But enough about my sappiness...

How was everyone's christmas? Mine was alright...I've definately had better....but it was pretty good. Scott bought me one of those tub spa thingies...I love it :) and he also got me some perfume (Tommy Girl)my favoritest kind...besides candies. I had to buy another DVD player with my christmas money....but that's alright I reckon. I don't even remember all I got...it wasn't much. The older I get the more Christmas sucks...the more everything sucks. It's just not like it was when I was a kid. Everything was so simple then...and I didn't even realize it. Now I miss it so much but there's definately no going back.

I'm glad I do'nt have to worry about college for a while. I'm gonna start work sometime this week...she still has to call me. I'm kinda looking forward to it...but kinda not. I'm not because that means not as much Scott time and less sleep...but I am because that gives me something to do and also lots of money. *sigh* I don't know...I'll survive.

I'm not complaining though because it gets me out of school tomorrow :) The only downfall is I won't get to see Scott tonight :( But that's okay I guess...I need to clean my room anyways and catch up with friends I haven't talked to in forever..if the power doesn't go out that is.

Ya know...there's some really really stupid poeple in this world. People think I do some stupid things....my mistakes are nothing compared to the one <i>she's</i> about to make. Who in the world does that???? I guess I'll leave it at that...wouldn't wanna make anybody mad at me again. My mouth's gonna get me in big trouble one of these days...Although when I did something stupid she was always the first to tell me what an idiot I was. She didn't care to piss me off...do'nt see why I should care if I piss her off. She's gonna ruin her life cuz there's no way love is involved...grrr...people piss me off..lol. STupidness

I promise not to rant and complain this time. That seems like that's all my entries are anymore. Complaining and a bunch of other B.S. I""m sorry about that.

People are so irritating! Well...just one in particular. I guess I shouldn't let things get to me. He thinks he runs my freakin house. Just because he's dating my sister and is in college and only comes in on weekends does NOT give him the right to come in and take over when he's here. He thinks he's allowed to come and go as he pleases and don't have to ask my parents for anything and he's such a smartass. If things don't go his way, he pouts. I mean literally cries sometimes. Geez a freakin meez grow the hell up. Enough about him...how's everyone else? I""m sure you've quit reading my stupid pointless, fussy entries.

I miss my best friend. :( I haven't talked to her in a really long time and everytime we plan to do something together, something happens and we don't get to. That's alright I suppose cuz there's always next time.

I miss my other best friend too. She's changed so much and she doesn't even realize it. Talking to her gets you nowhere. Everyone's talked to her, to try and see waht's up. She just gets mad and defensive. According to her everyone else has changed and what she's doing is right. Maybe I'm wrong...if I am I will more than happily appologize. I do'nt know...all I tried to do is warn her of what's going to happen if she keeps doing what she's doing...tried to be a good friend and she goes and says I'm a bad friend. She knows it too she just do'nt want to admit it. What am I supposed to do? I've gotten to where I can't stand to be around her. OF course I""m not the only one. I don't know how to get through to her. So I""m giving up because she's stubborn and I only waste my breath. She'll see it soon enough I guess. 

Things most definately aren't like high school. High school was so simple but I'm not a kid anymore and I have to be responsible for my own actions and make my own decisions. I am very thankful that I have scott...someone that I can share my life with. I love him so much and he is so sweet to me. I've never been happier. He makes me feel so good and I don't know what I did to deserve him but I'm glad I did whatever I did.

A Tribute to ALL Daughters

Every home should have a daughter,
for there's nothing like a girl
To keep the world around her
in one continuous whirl...
From the moment she arrives on earth,
and on through woman hood,
A daughter is a female
who is seldom understood...
One minute she's laughing,
the next she starts to cry,
Man just can't understand her
and there's just no need to try...
She is soft and sweet and cuddly,
but she's also wise and smart,
She's a wondrous combination
of a mind and brain and heart...
And even in her baby days 
she's just born coquette,
And anything she really wants
she manages to get...
For even at a tender age
she uses all her wiles
And she can melt the hardest heart
with the sunshine of her smiles...
She starts out as a rosebud
with her beauty unrevealed,
Then through a happy childhood
her petals are unsealed...
She's soon a sweet girl graduate,
and then a blushing bride,
And then a lovely woman
as the rosebud opens wide...
And some day in the future,
if it be God's gracious will,
She, too, will be a mother
and know that reverent thrill
That comes to every mother
whose heart is filled with love
when she beholds the ""angel""
that God sent her from above...
And there would be no life at all 
in this world or the other
Without a darling daughter
who, in turn, becomes a mother!"

Not a lot's happened lately...mom's still using my car. She was supposed to get hers back today but the stupids at Advance gave Kevin the wrong parts now he has to get the right ones and start again. I've spent a whole lot of money on that car...lol. NOt that I'm complaining...I know that mom and dad can't really afford it right now and she needs her car. She can have mine for as long as she needs it though. She's kept me up for 19 years...I should help them out a little.

I'm looking forward to my job in a weird kinda way. I like the feeling of having money and I'm not gonna let it be like my graduation money and spend it on worthless shit and have absoultely nothing to show for it. Nopie :) 

I had to take Scott's truck to school this morning...he spent the night with me last night :) I love when we get to stay together....I really cant' wait until we can all the time. I love him so much :) I'm done now..:)

I didn't get to go to school at all last week because I was sick and mom had to have my car for work. As soon as I walked in the door the teacher let me know that I had a test. I asked her what was going to be on it and she was like ""you should've called"" I was like I did...I called and told you I wasn't going to be here. I asked her if I could get a study guide and take it the next time she decides to have class and she was like ""no, you should've called and gotten it"" I was like ""I DID!!"" We fussed for a little while. I did call that woman. I called and told her I wasn't going to be in class and I asked her if I had any homework or anything I had to bring in this week. She said not that I can think of...and I was like are you sure? and she said well I don't know...everything's in my car and I don't want to go see. So I did make an effort to get my homework. :P Don't like her boring ol classes anyhow.

I'm getting ready to have a date with a bottle of nyquil and the bed. I feel pretty crappy. I can't breathe, my tummy hurts and the room is spinning. Wonderful combination wouldnt' ya say?

I do'nt really have any new news or anything...I'm just on here to kill time until I get sleepy....the nyquil should kick in in a few mins. I took alot more than I was supposed to so I'll probably be sleeping until tomorrow evening sometime.

I got a job! The interview went better than I thought it would. I now work for Paul Harris at the tax place. Woo hoo. I'm pretty happy about that....AT least I'm gonna be getting me some more money. I got $1,117 from my financial aid and then yesterday I got a check for $210...not sure why I got that check...but I'm not complaining. I have lots of christmas money now I reckon.

Ya know...I don't miss Lee High anymore. I dont' miss the people and I dont' miss the school. Things have changed...people have changed and none for the better. Don't really know how to explain it and I'm not gonna go into it. I don't want to talk about it so I think I'll just keep it to myself. But I hope that after tonight everything will be better again. I didn't want to piss anyone off and I think that's what I did. But the truth hurts...it's kinda like iodine...it has to hurt before it helps. Someone had to do it...and no one wanted to hurt feelings. A lot of people here have had their feelings hurt so why should we roll out the red carpet for her? I dont' know....

I don't know what's going on with other people either....I don't know...I try my very best and I feel like a loser. I don't succeed when I try to talk to someone about how I feel. It's always about them and my feelings are pushed aside. Do you ever feel like you're in the way? I feel like that a lot lately. Like no one wants anything to do with me...family too. I dont' know...I guess it's just me. I dont' really have anyone to talk to anymore so I kinda keep it all inside. Well...I have Scott and Kirb...but I never getta see her anymore. I never get to talk to my best friend :( I miss her. I know that I can count on her though. and I love you Kirb!!! 

Scott's really great...I love him so much. He always makes me feel so much better. But sometimes things go on between the 2 of us that I can't explain. Nothing bad...just minor things. WE have a lot of ""talks"" lately...not that I'm complaining because I usually feel better when we talk like that...but I feel like i""m not good enough for him. I feel like he deserves so much better than me. I dont know...just things that run through my head.

I guess I should get out of Blackwater before it ""messes my head up"". lol I really dislike her. It's really nice to know who your real friends are though. I can't believe I even considered her a friend...a good friend at that. AT least I have at least 5 people I can depend on...5 people that I know will always be there for me no matter what.

I just watched the Fast and the Furious for the first time. That's a really good movie. I didnt' think I'd like it but I did. Lots of very nice cars...Vin Diesel didn't look too shabby....I think I spelled his name wrong.

Just a couple more hours til I get to see my baby. I miss him so much and I just saw him 11 hours ago. I miss him so much when I'm away from him and I can't wait until we're together all the time. I'm looking very forward to that day. I know he's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with and I will always love him. I dont' care who was in my past...they're gone now. I don't want anything else to do with them or anyone else for that matter. 

How can someone say ""I Love You"" and then take it back and say they didn't mean it? I mean really. If it's there...you know it. If you don't mean it then don't say it. I have never understood that. A lot of people confuse love with lust and others say it to be saying it. I know a lot of people that abuse the word and you shouldnt' do that. That just messes with people's heads. Especially when the person you say it too cares the world about you. *sigh* she just leads him on. She knows what she wants, she just don't want to admit it to anyone...especially him. Not saying anything bad about her because she's one of my best friends in the whole world but there's been a world of change and she's too stubborn to see it. I don't know...craziness...

Everybody was at my house until 4 this morning...Jacob was still here when I got back so we rode around Blackwater all night...stupid stupid stupid. I guess I can understand though...I know if it was Scott then I'd do the same thing. I'm very thankful for him...very very thankful. I treasure our relationship and I am so grateful that he came into my life. I do'nt want to end up like <i>them</i>. Not at all...

She called me a bad friend and said she didn't think I""d tell him that. *sigh* What the hell was I supposed to do? He acted as if he already knew. It wasnt' even me that told him.

I'm really happy with Scott...but I'm just waiting on something to mess that up. That's always the kind of luck I have and I don't plan on letting anything come between us. I love him so much and I guess I get kind of jealous when it comes to other girls but who doesn't? I do'nt want him to think I'm possesive or anything but I want him to know how much I love him. I've just never had anything this great before and I'm scared to death something's going to take it away. *sigh* I dont' know what brought these feelings on...it just kind of hit me all at once right after he left.

After I left class, a friend was sitting in the lobby waiting on me to get out. I didn't know he was gonna be there and I almost passed him up. I was like what are you doin??

You're so quick to judge...why do'nt you take a look in the mirror? I don't recall calling anyone a whore so you should get your facts straight before you say something to someone. You want to call me a whore? Look at yourself! You're the one that...ya know...nevermind..I wo'nt even go there.

I don't know where the hell you get that I'm a ""stupid lying bitch."" Do you get off on blaming someone for <B>YOUR</B> mistakes? I told you a long time ago that I didn't want anything else to do with you but you talked to me as if nothing ever happened. That shit don't fly. 

I knew a long time ago about all of your stupid lies. I never said anything...so you made me out to be the fool. I finally stood up and said something...then you got mad and quit talking to me. But a few weeks later you were right back there to lie to me some more. I don't have to take your shit and I refuse to be manipulated. I didn't say all that shit you said I did. And I certainly haven't said anything about you that I haven't said to your face. That's just a perfect example of you and your lies. You think it hurts my feelings that you ""hate me and wish me and Kirb would die and go to hell""? It doesn't bother me one bit. That just shows me that you are the immature one. 

You want to make me out to be the bad guy? Go ahead. I don't care...but anyone with half of a brain would know better than to believe a lying, decieving little bitch. You're nothing but a drama mama that can't remember to get her stories straight. You change every story 10 times before you're done. Who's the stupid one? 

I know for a fact that you're still with Damon. I have my sources and I don't care if you're with him. What I cared about was the fact that you lied about it. I don't think he ever laid a hand on you either. I bet if he knew half of what you say to people he'd knock the hell out of you. I think I should probably enlighten him on the situation. He was upset because Josh went around telling everybody that he hit you, I wonder how he would feel if he knew that you were the one starting the shit? I bet he wouldnt' be too happy about it. What do you think?

You lie about everything! And you want to go and call us the liars?! I know about how you went and told everyone that me and Kirb went and lied on you. You told everyone you were innocent and you didnt' know what brought that on. You're so freakin stupid! Everybody knows. Look around! It's not all about you. You can leave Kandice and Becky out of the situation too...they have nothing to do with it. If they dislike you..that's their business because i'm sure they have good reason. I do..You're not a very liked person and you have yourself to thank for that. Everything going on is all your fault. You need to wake up and grow up because not everything is about you and your drama living life. You won't get anymore pitty parties from us because we finally wised up and figured out how you really are. Soon everyone else will figure it out. Most people already know, they're just too nice to hurt your feelings. I do'nt care anymore because I've put up with it long enough. And ya know...you can only have so many brain tumors before you actually die. But I guess the doctors found a miraculous cure for that too huh? Just like everything else...you have a quick save. You're a good liar ya know? Very believable...for a while.

I rememeber the time you ""dislocated your shoulder."" You came to school whining because it hurt. Erica barely brushed your shoulder accidentally and you started crying because it ""hurt"". Then here comes Josh Stiltner, the guy you wanted to f*ck, he shook the hell out of you and you just grinned and batted your eyes and never even mentioned pain. The next day I hugged you just to see if you really were in pain. You told me you were better. we knew you were lying.

I can think of a few more lies you told...see? I have proof to back up what I say. Where was your proof when you were ""pregnant"" Oh yeah...miscarriage...another quick save. What about the swelling of your brain? Did that go away too? What about when your tampon ripped you open? You can have sex with 50 people but you cant' wear a tampon? How convenient. People like you need to be in a psych ward...yeah...that's right. I called you psychotic. I'm not the only one that thinks that either. I think I do need to talk to Damon...we can compare notes :) IT's just amazing to me how you're the only one he ever hit. I've talked to all of his other girlfriends and they say he was never anything but nice to them...I guess it's just you he beats. It's just you that everyone wants to beat huh? Wah wah wah...go cry to someone that cares. You amaze me you really do. There's definantly no one quite like you. You need a life. I guess you get off on hurting other people.

I don't care how many comments you leave in my journal...I really don't. You want us to have a ""shitty life""? lol that's cute. You're in college now? I'm glad you think that the way I act is pittiful and childish. Maybe I should be more like you. :)"

Certain people are highly irritating....Just because someone lets you know how they feel...does not mean they want rid of you so they can have someone else. People assume too much. 

Kirb, I'm sorry I made you think that...but that's not what I meant at all. I hope we're okay now that we have that straightned out. I loooovvvveee you! You're my bestest. Bailie, you and I need to talk! lol I miss ya! 

My man gets off at 4:30 today...so I'm kinda killing time until he calls. I don't get to see very many people anymore. Everyone's at school when I'm not...I go Tuesday's and Thursdays whereas everyone else goes Mon. Wed. and Friday. :( I miss seeing everyone so much. I do'nt really miss high school all that much anymore. I like the freedom of college.

Well I suppose I""ll get off of here now and take a shower or something....bye bye :D"

Not saying anyone's talking about me or anything...I just don't know anymore. I do'nt like it...but what can I do? My phone rings just as well as hers so if she wants to talk....she can call me. No biggie...i'm not losing sleep over it...I'm just tired of being the one that has to keep in touch all the freakin time. I'm the only one trying to save the friendship. Who cares? It's really depressing and very irritating. She should at least have the decency to tell me why we haven't talked in a week. We used to talk all the time....who knows? I do'nt care anymore.

Me and Samantha are getting a little closer now...I used to not talk to her cuz I did'nt know what to say but now i talk her ear off...I only have to go from 8-12:05 now :) I used to have to go until 4:05 with a 3 hour break from 12:05-2:50. I hated that. I like it better now....my last class was cancelled so I have to take it on video and only show up to class on test days. I can handle that. 2 days a week isn't bad at all. That's only 8 hours a week :)

I've been getting hit on a lot lately. not sure why. Some guy came up to me in wal-mart the other day adn asked me if we'd met before. I was like no...he was like are you sure? I was like yeah pretty sure why? HE was like something as pretty as you, I'm sure I""ve seen before. I was like nope...never seen you before in my life and I walked away. Then yesterday I had to get some stuff for school and a dude followed me around wal-mart. Everywhere I went...there he was. He never talked to me he just stared and followed me. I finally went down an isle into the crafts and he left. Then on my way out to my car him and 2 of his buddies were sitting on the bench outside the doors and they stared at me and smiled when I walked by. Weirdos....I hate going anywhere by myself anymore. Although I""m getting quite used to it. I""m also getting used to the fact that anytime I need someone they're never there for me but when they need something I""m the first one they run to. I won't mention any names...that wouldn't be very nice...besides...I don't want to be banned from LJ anymore. 

Someone that I don't want anything to do with e-mailed me the other day...grrr...can't get rid of her no matter how hard I try. 

But I suppose I shall get off of here for now...I get to go to Duffield Daze this weekend...woo hoo...lol  goodnight and sweetdreams. :)"

I have to go get my books today. Scott's going with me..at least he loves me. Sometimes I feel like he's the only one that does...aside from my family that is. I wish I'd got them when I went to the college with Pearcy but I forgot my schedule.

I need some new friends. The past few weeks I""ve come to realize that there's 2 people...3 at the most that I could trust with my life. I've also realized that the majority of my friends only come around or call when they want something. I don't do that to them so what gives them the right to do that to me? When I call someone they're always like ""oh I'll call you back"" Yeah...do they ever call? Nope. OH well...whatever. Don't need them anyways. I'll just stick to my 3 trustworthy friends. Screw the rest.

I'm running on like 4 hours of sleep. Me and Scott sat up until 5 talking this morning...I went to bed at 5:30 then got up at 9:30 and went to church. We talked about a lot last night. Mostly about our fight we had Thursday night. It wasn't my fault....I swear I wasn't doing anything wrong. It's a long story so I guess I'll just leave it at that. He told me he was sorry for fussing at me cuz it was him he needed to bitchslap. Sometimes I feel so awful. I dont' know what it is....I know I did nothing wrong yet I'm the one that always winds up feeling like shit. Oh well...that's life I suppose. 

WE worked everything out after our very <B>long</b> discussion. I love him so much and I don't want to do anything to mess it up. I know I made him mad...he just won't admit it. He told me that that was the closest thing to mad he's ever gotten at me....but I can't make him understand that I wasn't the one doing anything. I was just stupid cuz I didn't see what the guy was doing. It's nothing major or anything....but I see where he was upset.

I would've been a lot happier if Scott had went with me...but he didn't want to and I didn't make him. He's not a funeral person and that's understandable. Yesterday was weird not having to go to Pennington after church :( I miss her so much already. but she was gone a long time ago...she just laid there lifeless for the longest time. It's for the better I guess :(

I went school shopping today. I didn't buy much cuz I couldn't find anything I wanted. I got 3 pairs of jeans and that's about it. Today was a very irritating day. My house is like 500 degrees and fans arent' helping. I get a new heat pump Wednesday :) It costs like 5,000 bucks....but that's okay. 

My dad ran over my puppy the other night :( She was breathing really funny like and dad thought he broke her back or damaged something on the inside. I thought she was going to die...she's so little. The car ran right over top of her....she's okay now though. She limps a little but she's just as playful as she was before. I know you guys really care about all this nice stuff...but I thought I'd tell ya anyways. 

Christie has been calling Scott again. I guess I""m gonna have to whoop her ass. She's trying to break us up....and she's pissed cuz he's not falling for it. His mom answered the phone the other day and told her not to call back because it bothered me that she called and Scott doesn't want her to call back. She told her that Scott has a really great girlfriend and she doesn't need to be trying to mess it up. I was so proud :) Then the next day that bitch called him at work...grrr. I dislike her. I'd like to talk to her..just once. I'd let her have it...I'm getting better at telling people what I think. I can't wait to talk to Lindsay again....she really pisses me off....

I got up this morning and took Kandice to get her learner's...she passed...that's a good thing cuz I don't have to drive anymore :) she's probably gonna take over my car now...I got it back by the way :) I missed it a lot. 

I don't know what was wrong w/me tonight though....me and Scott went to Duffield and rented a walk to remember...and I got emotional. We didnt' get to finish it but I did after he left and it was a really good movie. I liked it anyways. I cried when Scott left. I really didn't want him to go for some reason. I felt like I needed him here w/me....but he left..of course I didn't ask him to stay with me because he has to get up at 5...but I would've felt a lot better if he had stayed.  

I took Paul home around 10:30...when I got back from Duffield mom told me that granny had passed away. I kinda expected it...I really don't know what I feel right now. I want to cry but I can't. We went and saw her today and she looked so pittiful. I hated seeing her in the shape she was in. She couldn't open her eyes, talk, move or anything. I know the people in the nursing home had something to do with that...they dont' care about the people that are in there....I've watched them with the older people. If she had came home and had in home care she would probably still be here. Her kidneys had failed and the doctor took out her cathedor...however you spell that...but she's gone now :( I don't know how to react or anything..right now I think I'm just in shock...but I know I need a big hug. There's no one around for me to talk to...all I want to do is cry. *sigh* I don't know what to do...I know she's better off now but it still hurts. All I can think about is how I should've been there more. I used to stay with her and my grandparents all the time. There was no place like papaw's. *sigh* What I would give to have those days back. I should've been more caring...I was a kid..how was I to know though? I know I should've spent more time with her. I'll be alright though...I knew it was going to happen...I was just hoping it wouldn't be this soon.

Let me ask you something....if you were dating someone and someone from your partners past starts calling them again...someone that used to like your partner a whole lot...would you be bothered by that? Maybe it's just me and I shouldn't worry about it. I know he loves me...I know he'd never do anything to harm our relationship...but there's always those what if's. I love him a lot...I care about him more than anything in the world....and I don't know what to do. I'm scared to death old feelings are going to come back...from both ends. I dont' like her. I guess I really have no reason not to like her...but I hate her simply because she likes him :( That's mean...I know. She wanted to hump him at one point too...grr.

Isn't that so sweet????! Scott bought me a card the other day and that's what was on it. *sigh* I love him. That made everything great :) Not that there was anything wrong before...but that definately would've made me forget anything that was wrong. He's my baby :) Nothing or no one could come between us...Not even...<b>her</b>. Grrr on her. That'll be all of that topic....Ima kick her ass...she's calling him again :( But he's only talked to her once and she called to ask why she wasn't invited to the wedding. LOL Good ol Anthony...lied to her to get her off of Scott's back. *sigh* Anthony just wanted a piece I think...Anyways...she's gonna leave my man alone :)

Other than that nothing has happened. I went and watched signs last night in Coeburn. That's a really good movie. It's the best one I've watched in a while actually. We sat in the very back corner and could hear the toilet flush everytime someone used the bathroom. It was kinda funny...yeah probably one of those had to be there things.

"event","Why are men so insecure?  I guess women are too but geez!   What's the point in worrying about anything?  Worrying never changes anything.  All it does is torture you and usually what you worry about is the least likely thing to happen anyways.

I didn't get to see Scott today because he had to help someone hang doors or somethin. I hate not seeing him because I always feel so lonely when he's not around.  He called me as soon as he got home. He was alright at first. He was talking and laughing but then he got quiet and I hate when he gets quiet because I know he's thinking. I asked him what was wrong and he told me that he felt like I deserved better than him. It really bothers me when he says stuff like that. I love him and I tell him that at least 50 times a day. I guess it's not enough or something but I wish he wouldn't be that way. I feel like he doesn't believe me. It's like he's always questioning it. He's afraid I'm gonna find someone else. I don't want anyone else because I love HIM and only  HIM. I do'nt know how to tell him what he means to me anymore than what I do. We do great....all except for the insecurities.

A few weeks ago we had almost the same discussion. He thought I wanted to be with someone else because I talk to other guys. A lot of my friends are guys and it means nothing when I talk to someone else. Gosh....He thought I had a thing for one of my closest guy friends a while back before we started dating. This guy is like my older brother or something and there was no feelings whatsoever toward him but Scott thought differently. *sigh* I don't know what it is....

We were in Movie Starz the other day and I ran into a guy that always talks to me. When we left I noticed he was acting funny. He looked upset but said nothing was wrong. He finally told me that me talking to that other guy bothered him. Okay first of all I barely know the guy. When we talk, it's kinda like a hi, how ya doin, bye conversation. When we went to the counter I let go of Scott's arm. He told me that that bothered him too. The reason I let go of his arm was because I had to give the woman the movie....not because I didn't want Chad to see us together. Also he told me that I was probably wishing that he wasn't anywhere around so that I could talk to Chad. Yeah...that hurt. That really hurt that he actually thought something like that would even cross my mind. I dont' know...maybe it's just me. But he lets a lot of things bother him that shouldn't. I do love him....no one else. There is no one in this world that I'd rather be with. He's my everything and I wish I could make him understand that. He says he believes me but if he does then why does he act that way? gosh....I do'nt know. I don't like Chad...I've never liked Chad. *sigh* I don't know. He told me tonight that he wished he could be more like me and not let anything at all bother me. Lots of things bother me...I just tend to hide it. It's better to focus on the happy things rather than the bad things. I wish he wouldnt' worry so much...

I guess I""ll get off of here for now though and find something to do so I won't think so much. Goodnight and sweetdreams :)"

"event","Hey guys. Could you please actually tell me when something's going down?
I'm kinda sick of hearing about things an hour or whatever before it actually happens.
Or not hearing about it at all. Then I hear about what happened later and I get asked, ""Hey, why didn't you come?""




If you could, that'd be great. Thanks."

That's basically all I wanted to say.
Merry Christmas! Actually now it's Boxing Day.
I'm taking a lifeguarding class during break.
I got a sweet scarf that's soft and comfy from Kelsey. : ) And a wallet cuz she's sick of the alien. : P

Someone update me on my friends page, cuz I haven't read those in a long time either. Just tell me the latest? Haha.
Swimming's started, band's almost done. Practically.
My body hurts. I feel like the summer, except then I could move and everything wasn't in pain. Yay.
I'm contemplating doing a winterline next year. At Central that probably wouldn't work but Western it would work better. There's GLP in Grand Rapids.
I'm going to miss drumming, not band. That's why I want to do a winterline. Hmm.
So how are you all doing? I'm in a good mood. Maybe that's cuz it's the last day before break. What's kicking during break? I'm not guaranteeing that I can attend, but I'd love to know if there are things I'm invited to. I'd like to see the new Harry Potter movie. I might just wait to see it on video though. I'm not so interested in spending 7 bucks. Wow, I sound cheap. But really, I could easily just rent a movie and watch it over and over for much much much less than half that price.
Polaris is so good. Thanks Alex. Hope you're at Thanksgiving. Eh, you don't do Livejournal..
Piggies! ; )
What else?
Oh, I finished Season 3 of Alias. I like that show, I don't care what you people say. David Brent? from the Office was on it for an episode, Quentin Tarantino was in a few episodes, David Carradine was in it too. I'm not going to lie, I didn't really know their names. Thanks imdb. Ha.
I should find a job, but it's kinda useless during swimming.
Oh! I started a bible study thing with Jason, our youth pastor and another couple guys from youth group. It's fun stuff.
Hmm. I think that's it for now.
Hope you have a good day!

Who replied to my last post about state? Hmm. I don't think so, sorry. Aside from the partying, rioting and humongous campus; that place isn't calling me much.
You know what's sweet? Drama. I love drama. Drama is like air for the band. Well for pretty much anybody. There is never enough drama apparantly.
Western next weekend! I hope it's still ok, Nick. :) I think it'll be fun.
I have a buncha bug bites. I think I know what they're from (aside from bugs) but I don't care.
3 days of band this week. We don't have a football game, do we?
This face is ""trippy"" in the infamous word of Brad.
I like drumming right now. Not like I didn't before, but it's fun. And you guys (drumline) make it more fun for me. Thanks. :)

I just (like 3 hours ago) got accepted to Western. :)
This entry is mainly for Nick and Pete and Kevin and Matt.
Sorry my Central buddies (and pretty much my whole family). I've betrayed you. I can be a spy for the enemy though. Both ways! If I had a death wish, I could wear a western shirt to central or a central shirt to western.
I probably sound really stupid now.
But I'm done with my computer science program and now I'm rocking out to JEW.
I'm kinda sad about the decision, but hopefully it'll all work out happy in the end.:)
Kelsey is awesome!
I'm kinda bored.
It's really warm in here and I'm wearing a dress shirt and khakis and stuff. Gosh.
Mary's looking up metalsmithing stuff for college.
I can't wait til this weekend. Homecoming with a bigger group than originally planned. :) Hanging out with Kelsey. Hanging out with the Power Trio(plus other cool guys/girls hopefully. :) 
Have a good day chillin's!

Um.. Yeah.
I asked in my last entry who wanted to hang out. That applied to leavingfriends and stayingherefriends. Haha everybody replied to the Harry Potter stuff though. I'm in the third chapter. I'm usually a fast reader, honest. I just have to work everyday for pretty much the whole day.
So I guess nobody wants to hang out. I'd seriously love to.
So there is a ""Fun House"" in Royal Oak, but it certainly wasn't open when Kelsey and I tried to find it. Then we went into a creepy record store. Flipside scares me. Then we stayed in a park after hours. Then got a shake from Mickey D's. It's that new one. I don't like the Mango but the raspberry is good. Too bad it's a mix..
The music is weird this year. I dunno about that. No synth part?!
I'm bored.
Block party today. 4-8 at the church near Ellen's house. (Glen Oaks Alliance Church.) It'll be fun, Jason promises.
Also, party tomorrow at Kelsey's church. It's in the boonies though.

I need to hang out with leaving friends soon. Like soon. Who's open and when? (This can also include friends that aren't leaving.)
Haha jubilant.
Ok.
Have a good day!"

Work has been hard but fun I guess. Kinda satisfying. I had Wednesday, Thursday and Friday off. :) Oh, Monday too.
I've done.. stuff since I last updated. Summer has been great. Friends and everything.
This weekend we went up north for the 4th. Kelsey came with us too. It was much fun. I don't know what to say about it though..
The temperature was so nice up there. Wow. My farmers tan was not evened out whatsoever, but my arms neck and face are darker. Goodness.
I've been watching a lot of Alias. I like it.
I felt like I haven't seen a lot of you in forever. So let's hang. Too bad I can't make plans cuz I don't know when I work or for how long. So call me when you're free or leave a message on my phone.

"event","Hmm, I left off with last Tuesday.
Wednesday I went to work in the morning. Doing a driveway. They got one section ready for pouring and I did a lot of hauling and cleaning. It wasn't terrible. The next day we poured cement into that section. I liked when they poured, cuz then I could pretty much stand there and watch. It was fun. It's tough and I'm dead everyday, but oh well. Such is life.
Friday we broke the rest of the old driveway. Boy was that hard. My back killed so bad. Oh well again. I'm kinda just getting paid to work out is how Mike put it. My soon to be cousin. As of this Friday.
Now, Wednesday evening I went to percussion. That wasn't too bad. Passed out the cadence. They seemed to like it. Let's see how that turns out.
Thursday and Friday evenings I don't really remember what went down. Remind me?
Saturday was my uncle's wedding. I have four new cousins. Twin 14-year-old girls, a 12 or 11 year old boy, then a 7 year old boy. That'll be interesting. I hope we can actually get to know them or things might be kinda rough. They seem nice. Maybe a little spoiled but oh well. They also have a 9000 square foot house. What should I expect?
I have the worst farmers tan. Framers.
Saturday was some Amy's house watching Ocean's Twelve. That was fun. :)
Sunday was Father's Day. I love my Dad. I hope you love yours too. Kelsey came here. We watched a movie and such then went to Jenna's. That was fun too. Great fun. :)
Monday was another day of work. We poured the finishing part of the driveway. Then we went to the new job. Which is near the other Uncle's house. It's a chimney. I was so freaked out of trying to climb down the ladder or just to walk around on the roof. Today I slipped on a rock and almost fell. Think of how that'd go. Intersting enough. Today we demolished the chimney, tomorrow we put up the new one. The house was actually built by my Opa with the same company like 50 years ago or whatever. That's kinda awesome.
Today I went swimming after work with my cousins. We had a splash ball fight. Those are fun. He kinda won though. Crazy baseball kid. He is 11 or something, maybe even younger. I think he can throw better than I can. He loves baseball.
<lj-cut text = ""dermatologist appointment."">
I went to the dermatologist about my hair. The lady didn't have much to say. And I didn't understand a lot. But she said it was male pattern baldness. Balding? Yeah whatever. She gave me 4 free samples of Rogaine. And then a lot of free samples for my acne. Sweet. Lady, your awesome.
She said I can't use Propecia til next year cuz it hasn't been tested on those less than 18. So I have to use this for a year then see where we go. Sweet. </lj-cut>
I wanna see if Fil would want to go swimming with me after work at my other Uncle's house. That'd be fun. Even though Fil doesn't work with them. I think it'd be fun. And I'd get a chance to talk to Fil.
Wedding Friday for Mike and Andrea!! :) More time with cousins.
This is a really long entry oh well. I don't care.
I think I have a day off this week besides Friday. I really hope so. I'm dead.
Have a good day. Call if you're so inclined.

I played Half Life 2 this morning. It was fun, even though I have no clue what the heck I'm doing.
I got X&Y, the new album by Coldplay from Anth. Yay.
I think I'm gonna start watching Alias, since my sister has the DVD's anyway.
Friday was probably the easiest. Lit was horrible, and I don't expect the grade to be too great. Then again, I don't excel in english classes that much. Kinda ironic cuz that's the classes I got into honors with.
Brad and Kelsey came to my house afterschool. After we went to National. Hmm. It was fun, we watched Willy Wonka. I kinda both want to and not want to see the new one. Depp is one crazy guy. Then we went to Claudia's surprise party. That was fun but I felt kinda weird. I didn't know half the people there (which was like 4 people) and they were all older. Then we went to Michelle's going away party. Could have been better in some parts. But it was fun I guess.
Saturday we had our big Percussion sectional. Kinda stunk cuz I felt like not much got done. Oh well. Joel's was fun. I think people behaved a lot better than we thought they would.
Sunday was Church then Cory's grad party. Then we watched Holes. And the music video. Many times over. Many more times. We also went swimming though. Which was fun. I think one of the first times this year. Ashley's was first though.
Monday we watched Firefly at Nates. That was fun. I saw WOW. Looks fun, but not worth all that money. Then we went to watch movies or segments of movies at Ellens. Finding Neverland then a buncha segments of different movies she had there.
I called my uncle. Let's see how that goes. I might need a crazy massage tomorrow. From anybody. Even the massager thing in our living room if I have to. Goodness.
Um, I dunno what's going on today. Call. :)
Ooh, Carmen Sandiego theme acapella. Fun stuff.

Yeah, it's been a year to the date. I can't say it was horrible, but I can't say it was the best. It's so hard, cuz some of the best things have happened this year, but also some of the worst. I dunno. This may not be something to be publicly talking about?
Yesterday we went to Subway. Then I dropped people off and Kelsey and I went to the scrapbook store. Then I went home. Then I went to band, which was kinda lame. We know how to march. I'm glad the drumline doesn't usually go to these practices.
Practice saturday. Hopefully we'll work on cadences. :) Or something fun.
Then Joel's. Which should be awesome, if it goes well.
Friday is going to be like 3 different shindigs, all kinda going down at the same time.
Kelsey came over and we made EasyMac, since we don't have any good mac and cheese. Also, that's the first thing that came to mind. Then we watched Fivel Goes West. I don't think I know how to spell his name right. But that movie is soo cheesy when you've grown more up. It was so cool when we were little though.
I'm bored.
We're seeing my uncle's 9000 square foot home tonight. That's huge.
Right now we're going to the cemetary.
Have a good day.

So, if there were any day's you (people) would suggest to take off, please tell me. Such as, I know Nate's working weekends, Brad's working weeks, and Cory and Brian aren't working. Well Cory maybe. Well, that goes for any other friends too, but you know.
I was thinking Wednesday Friday something like that. Maybe more, or different days.
When were we planning on D&D?
Or any other ""special"" events.
Yeah.. I'd like your input. If you have any. I almost said imput.

"event","This weekend gave me a taste of summer.

Is summer supposed to be capitalized?


I want the whole pie.

I went to a LAN party; slept; watched Patriot, After the Sunset (Good.), Uptown Girl (A real downer, the beginning was way better than the ending. It looked more upbeat in previews.), EuroTrip (could have been better.), American Pie (I'm not thrilled with these movies, I don't really find them funny. It seems like an excuse to show woman parts.); went swimming already :); played a buncha frisbee; attempted to watch Bob Ross (That was Wednesday but it still counted.).
I think I left a lot out. Just comment it in. :)

My eye is bloodshot, and it has been for the past few days. This isn't good.

It feels like I haven't driven in a week.

We visited Dan at TCBY. I think it annoyed me when people came into Burger King and asked what I thought they should get. But I guess a frozen yogurt parlor is kinda different than a fast food restaurant. Nonetheless I think Dan usually says ""I don't know."" So it doesn't matter anyway.

We watched National Treasure on the way home, people were stupid and wouldn't let us watch Episode II. Oh well, I knew the basic premise when we saw the third one.
Oh man! Episode III! Holy crap it was good. I had a fun time before the movie too. Man, I wanna see it again cuz I was real tired.
I'm dead. I need to take a nap. Maybe I'll do that now. Good idea.

<lj-cut text = ""Let's hit it up."">
ANGER
1. Who did you last get angry with? I really couldn't tell you. I was frustrated but I don't remember what about.
2. What is your weapon of choice? Words? I haven't really ever gotten in any fights.
3. Would you hit a member of the opposite sex? Not seriously.
4. How about of the same sex? But of course.
5. Who was the last person who got really angry at you? I couldn't tell you..?
6. What is your pet peeve? Haven't really thought about it. Some people could probably answer this for me though.
7. Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily? I try to let them go.

SLOTH
1. What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time? Floss. Mitch Hedberg puts it quite nicely. Quitting smoking is like starting flossing. I've never smoked so I don't know how it is giving it up firsthand. But I know it's hard, judging from patches and kits they have out. They should have getting into flossing kits.
2. What is the latest you've ever woken up? Probably 11.30:
3. Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't: Um.. my mom.
4. What is the last lame excuse you made? I don't want to.
5. Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through (one of the long ones...)? But of course. I love them.
6. How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today? Well my dad doesn't have a snooze alarm. But usually, 2 or 3. The clock is fast and I'm ready too early anyways.

GREED
1. How many credit cards do you own? Big fat 0.
2. If you had $1 million, what would you do with it? Probably save most of it. Give some away to different things. Give my dad a bunch. Probably buy the rc car I've been wanting to get for a while. Or a computer.
4. Would you rather be rich, or famous? Being famous seems like it would suck. I'll take a little rich. Not too much.
5. Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks? Nope.
6. Have you ever stolen anything? Matt Kole thinks I am a thief.

FAITH
1. What religion do you follow? Christianity/Catholicism
2. What religion were you raised as? Catholicism
3. Do you believe that forgiveness is a religious property, or a human property? Can I add another question mark?
4. Do you believe in magic? Only in the movies. Which means no.
5. What was the last promise you broke? You tell me?
6. Have you ever said the words to a prayer and not meant it? I try not to.

HOPE
1. Did you get everything you wanted over the last holiday season? Nope, but they didn't matter. One thing did.
2. Do you let yourself get your hopes up for something even if you know that there is a large chance of failure? Of course.
3. Have you ever bought a lottery ticket? I've scratched them before.
4. Do you gamble? No.
5. Have you ever had something called off on account of bad weather, but then gone ahead and done it anyway? What kind of question is this?

FORTITUDE
1. What are you most afraid of? The unknown.
2. What did you do today that was really brave? Um, I don't know?

4. Would you put your life in danger to rescue someone? Sure.
5. Have you ever gotten stage fright? Probably.

TEMPERANCE
1. Do you collect anything? Not really.
3. Are you addicted to anything? Depends.
4. What's your preferred method of paying for things? Money.
5. Tell us one thing you wish you hadn't let yourself do: Done as much as I have. Been not thankful enough. Take things for granted.
6. Do you feel that you obsess over things? I don't think so.

PRUDENCE
1. Do you take advice when it's given? Sometimes. When it sounds like a good idea and it comes from a good person that I trust.
2. Do you drive defensively? Sure? Haha you tell me.

Ten random things you've done today.
1: Dreamt a crazy dream.
2: Took a nap.

"event","The fundraiser dinner was a lot of fun. I can't wait til the missions trip though. I've never been on one. WJ is funny. Haha.
Kelsey and I watched National Treasure. That movie is crazy. It was good though. A little bit far-fetched. Kurtis and my dad liked it though.
Oh, about my dream. Yeah I took a two hour nap, and this is what became of it:<lj-cut text = ""Crazy Horse."">

So it kinda was like Dad was driving me home from something, what it was I don't remember. Then when we get home, he tells me he found a horse or something. He tells me it's in the little playhouse shed thing in the back.
So I go back and I'm a little freaked out. I see it, woah it's a real horse! It's head sticks out the window and I pet it. I was like ""Ah! I'm nice don't bite me!"" And I think it spoke back to me, through it's mind or something. It was all white, I believe. My sisters come home and I yell at them to come around back and they see the horse and everything. They pet it.
So now I noticed that it's not really sitting on the ground. And by the way, it's body is shaped like a doghouse. With little legs. Woah.
So somehow we decide to build a bigger playhouse or something. So I guess the swim team ended up at my house. At least all I remember was working with Jon Kim. Maybe John. I don't know. I don't really remember what we were building cuz it made no sense.
Everything was all painted dark green and it was all shiny paint. And I think there were lace curtains or they were trimmed with lace. And I guess that this house was for the horse.
And somewhere in the middle of all this, there was a sequence of newspaper articles rushing at the camera. Like in movies where the papers just show up and you can read just the headlines. They were about a lost horse, then it was found, then we got to keep it.
Ok, I just remember building the house not much what the whole thing looked like.
Somewhere I was playing a board game at the end of the dream. It might have been Candyland.
</lj-cut>

It was crazy I tell you.
Phew. I'm still tired.
Did that make any sense to you? It didn't really to me.
Friday was rehearsal for the fundraiser dinner. That was fun.
Yetterday Kelsey and I, as I already told you, watched National Treasure.
We also went to Kurtis's soccer game, which got rained out. It was horrible, but we just laughed right through it. Then the dinner, then we watched more of the movie. :o) (Greg sent that face to me in an email once.)(Ellen makes those.)
Today we're going to my grandma's house. So I have to miss youth group. Poo.
So my dad tells me the reason towels make the crack noise when you whip them is cuz it breaks the speed of sound. So my arm has a welt on it cuz Phil broke the speed of sound into my skin. :P
Alright, I'll stop this now.

Friday I.. went to Cory's for a movie. We watched Starship Troopers and then Kelsey came, then we finished that movie and then when more people arrived, we watched Machurian Candidate. I don't think I really got the whole movie, but oh well. It was a fun time.
Saturday we saw A Midsummernight's Dream. I don't know where the space goes. I didn't get that one either. But I don't really enjoy Shakespeare too much. Oh well, I had fun. It ended and we were like, ""Hey, it's only 10 oclock."" So we journied? journeyed? to Jenna's house. We started Phantom but couldn't finish it. I hope we can sometime. That was another fun day.
Sunday was mother's day. Sigh. Oh boy. Kurtis made a book for Mom in school. It was probably the cutest but saddest thing ever. His spelling is lacking, but the content is there. On one of the pages, it said ""If I could make one wish for mom... I wish she wus ulive agen!"" I dunno how accurate that was. It was copied from my sister's journal. What a day.
We went to my uncle's cuz my cousin had his first communion. It was fun. I haven't seen my cousins in a while. Probably Easter, since that's when we celebrated April birthdays I think.
Then I came home and went to Kelsey's to watch a movie. The Jerk, with Steve Martin. About right. It was a good one, I've seen most of it before though. I think my parents skipped over the bad'ns when we watched it when we were little.
Monday Tuesday and Wednesday kinda melded into one. I remember hanging out with Cory and the guys once, twice, a few times. And hanging out with Kelsey afterschool yesterday.
They still haven't set the line yet. Poo.
I stink at Uno and Candyland. Even though Candyland isn't really having to do with any skill. Basically it's who gets the right cards? Uno I'm just horrible at it. I don't have little siblings to play with though. :P
The brownies burned the roof of my mouth.
But they were insanely good. Thin mint yum. !
Tonight bible study. Is bible capitalized?
I dunno what else. Um, then I'll leave it at this.

I hate it when you guys argue. Maybe I'm not much better, but at least I'm trying to stop it. Most of the time things just perpetually get worse.
This song makes me happy(er).
Today I was so incredibly tired. I thought I was ok in lesson. I thought I was going good for some of the time at drums. But now, things aren't looking too hot. Whatever. I'm seriously sick of waiting. I was so mad when they didn't say anything about setting the line this week. It takes them forever.
Then I went to the end of bible study at Kelsey's. It made me feel better. There's bible study with Cory tomorrow. I have a book to make for German. I don't know if I'll be able to do both.

Alright, so some guy was just here. He is somehow related to us, we have yet to decide how. And he knows pretty much my dad's entire family tree. He has it on his computer and everything. It's crazy. I guess he's been spending his whole retirement tracing all of us back to one guy. Woah! He's traveled near and far finding out the details.
I already talked about band.
Orch festival was great. I really really liked out performance.
Then I went to Laura's. She made us dinner and it was yummy. I need to figure out how to get to her house for next time. :P Then we almost didn't find our way to see Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy. Luckily, for both trips, I had Kelsey as a navigator. :) I enjoyed the movie. If anybody has the book, sometime in the future I'd like to read them. Then, cuz our house is so clean, I had the group back here. We played pick up sticks and Apples to Apples. Fun stuff. Jimmy enjoyed his b-ball game too.
And today I had church and then visitors now I'll be heading to youth group soon. Weee. Fun weekend.
And that's that.
Yeah, next weekend's mother's day. Poo.

<P>""Everybody reacts different to something like this- some people cry buckets, other folks store it up inside. When someone you love dies, you get a big bowl of sadness put down in front of you, steaming hot. You can start eating it now, or you can let it get cool and eat it bit by bit later on. Either way, you end up eating the whole thing. There's really no way around it."" </P>
<P>-""Fig Pudding"" by Ralph Fletcher</P>
<P>I like it, and it's so true. I'm kinda worried about when it'll truely get me.&nbsp;I don't know if it has already, so I may still have the hard stuff to get through. I really hope it's not as bad as Mrs. Vansickle says it could be. Ok, I don't like making these, it seems like I may be trying to make you feel bad for me.</P>

I borrowed Twin Snakes and Ocarina of Time from Dan.
Heard a lot of good things about them.
Maybe I'm not in the right mood but,
I died a bajillion times in the first level of Metal Gear.
And I couldn't get to the Deku Tree in Ocarina of Time.
So yeah.
I guess I'm supposed to know how to play Metal Gear and everything.
Help.

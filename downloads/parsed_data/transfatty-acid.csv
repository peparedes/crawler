"event","i have given up on art, and art has given up on me.  i spent the entire weekend trying to paint, the results were very discouraging.  I know forcing one to be creative does not produce great results, but even when i'm not forcing myself i chose to do nothing.  If you were to put a paint brush in my hand i wouldn't know the first thing to do.  

i have always said that art was fundamental to my existence, but now i feel like a fraud, only creating MAYBE one piece of art work per year. i feel even more phony when i am forced to discuss ""my art"" and my opinions on art/culture, i can talk the talk, my creative seems to shine as a con artist. i don't know if this is laziness, depression, or if i even had potential to begin with. My lack of confidence is really getting the worst of me, i have completed one class directed towards my area of study and i don't think i want to be a curator.  i don't know what i want to do, i don't know who i am, i feel like giant anonymous ninny who will die an indecisive raisin face."

friday equals casual day at work, which drives me nuts since i work with my mom and she doesn't like my casual clothes. she made me get changed before we left the house this morning and i cant stand what i am wearing which creates an instant un-confident heinous mood. 

the only boner about friday is i get to see my love nugget, the dry vag to this is that i'm too tired to express how happy and excited i truly am to get to see him.

I'm a little bit stressed out about next year, I won't qualify for a loan, and someone can only save so much.  I'm sure everything will work itself out, but i just keep thinking of expenses. I keep forgetting I have to eat. Maybe it would be cheaper to adopt a monkey and make my way through the streets of toronto like Aladdin and Apoo.

I can feel my body bloating with water and expanding with jelly beans, and chips, and pizza, and wine. I am on a new diet called eat whatever makes you feel good...Just don't expect to feel comfortable when you put on a form fitting skirt. 

Ugh, i feel my shit is hitting the fan....only to hit another, much larger fan.  Well at least it feels that messy and stinky--don't even get me started on the stink factor of my life right either.

"event","i finally made it down town saturday night. the night had great potential until i got my period and became bed ridden with pain and nausea. i felt so awful, that i ruined the evening. matt assured me i didn't, but i wish i could have spent more time with him (consciously).

i have become 50% less stressed about school, i did a painting awhile ago at an art fag that fits my assignment perfectly. i only have one more assignment and a write up to do.

today was full of coffee and danishes; lounging on hills and swinging benches in a sun beam. leaving you is so hard, i miss you so much already. i can't wait to find myself in your arms again tomorrow night <3"

"event","i just arrived at work, no one is here yet...which equals sneaking on the internet for me.

boner: 
i finish work earlier today.
i might be getting my tapered pants back from shelley's room.
saturday is now a day closer! 
i cleaned out my room and have two bags of clothes to give away.
my septum piercing smells enjoyably cheesey today.
i woke up this morning thinking about my love nugget.
i get to listen to my music before people get here.

dry vag: 
i broke my earphone this morning.
my shuffle played all depressing music set my mood today like hot rollers. 
i still feel a bit sick and bloated. 
my farts are also smelly so i don't want to let them sneak out at work. 
i have no more clothing left. 
today will also be a bad day for tips.
i have SO much homework to still do."

"event","well here is round 3...techinally speaking round 2 of the stomach flu.  

i cannot understand how someone can get the stomach flu twice in one month.  i woke up this morning feeling slightly nausiated. Before i knew it smelly runny poop and barf were everywhere/in the toilet!!

i was really looking forward to school, because not only does it mean learning, but it means i get to see matt, who i already miss so much its making the rest of my body hurt. i even attempted to get ready and was moments away from leaving, but i barfed...twice.  It was in that moment that i decided that it wouldn't be nice to vomit in some woman's hair due to the bumpy nature of bus transportation

this flu is making me feel over emotional and now i want to cry. i feel so weak. i think i need to slow down in general. i'm starting to feel like bilbo baggins when he starts blabbing about too much bread and not enough butter (being spread thin and not reaching the crust.)

honestly, just send me to the glue factory."

"event","i should be doing homework right now, but instead i find myself updating livejournal and eating a red popsicle.

i haven't updated in so long that i'm not really sure where to start...damn this popsicle is amazing...but not as amazing as my matty bobbins.

i don't know if life can get any sweeter. 

i think i'm going to go sleep now...well, after writing my teacher a tragic email begging for an extension."

"event","well...i'm pretty sure i just fucked up every good thing that was happening in my life in these past few days. i'm on that road of self destruction again pulling everything that gets in my way down with me.

i am so over whelmed with emotion that my body is physically protesting (or i am having an allergic reaction).  i cant cool down, my heart is racing, and i feel like i'm going to vomit.  my thoughts are whipping through my head so fast....oh god, the tears.

i am full of self doubt again. i feel like a total failure."

"event","i just got to work and took a huge crap which felt great since my stomach hasn't felt normal since i had the stomach flu. i then found a piece of garlic bread in the back room, so i ate it. now i feel sick again, so i snuck on to the internet.

tonight i am going to be seeing kiss me deadly and pony da look...and the culture pyramid. i think i'm the most excited to see pony da look since they naturally rock my socks off and then back on, inside out.

i can't stop thinking about the most incredible kiss i took part in on the weekend. wow. it was just creamy!

have a fabulous day everyone."

"event","<PRE style=""FONT: 12px arial""><EM>Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.

And in between the moon and you
Angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

I walk in the air between the rain,
Through myself and back again.
Where? I don't know

Maria says she's dying.
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house and
Takes her clothes off,
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping though my hands

Oh, Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head.""
She says, ""Shhh...I know it's only in my head.""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?""

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping.
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something.

Round here she's always on my mind
Round here, Hey man, I got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
Round here we stay up very very very very late

I... I can't see nothing, nothing
Round here
Catch me if I'm falling 
Catch me if I'm falling
Will'ya Catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you

I said I'm under the gun
Round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun 
Round here
I can't see nothing, nothing
Round here</EM></PRE><!-- ZoneLabs Popup Blocking Insertion -->

"event","you learn more than one new thing everyday. but lets just say i only learned one. that's 365 things a year x 16.6 years...well i don't have a calculator on me, but i sure know a decent amount of things. i think it would be a good idea to make a list of, pray, perhaps, seven things. seven new things you learn each day. it could be a map equation, it could be a city, it could be having six fingers is a dominated trait, or you can walk like a t-rex. it doesn't matter. but list these seven things daily, and then exchange said list with someone else who has done the exact same thing. then that would be 14 new things a day. doesn't that make you feel intelligent?
i really don't like how everything is rushed and outlined. why we are all molded the same when everyone knows, that 9 out of 10 people's intent is to break the mold. or to control it. whatever floats your boat. i believe those zen buddhists got the right idea when they say you can only truly learn something using intuition. you cannot be taught, you must know. that is important, knowing things, that is. this is why people are stressed and crazy, except they are not really stressed and crazy. their mind is just all cramped up. perhaps i was never meant to learn this, or attend that. we talk and talk about this ""freewill"". freewill is nothing but infinite choices. even your own existence, is a choice. a choice someone else made until you developed your own freewill. now it's your choice. we shouldn't be so anxious, no one ever said that things COULD ever work out in the end."

<P>life, since when are you ruled strictly by politics and religion. life, i thought you were deeper than that. those two things are manmade. why bother arguing, without humans, never would exist. what would exist? what roots us to this coarse ground? i think we all know. life, i do not want to lose those things because of those lesser two i mentioned. when we get to it life, those are our demise. we can't live with them, can't live without them. that must mean we share an equation. once we crack that, we will findyour meaning, life</P>

<P>everyone knows it's a V for Victory, because that's all that matters anymore. fuck pathos vs. ethos, the new revolution is rival vs. revel. get with the program, nothing appeals to our gut. our brain translates itself through our nerves. Since our gut has become more tolerant then the russian nihilists, we do not notice the messages. pain is a warning, we are blind to it. we will all die, everything we do is too late. shall we embrace it? cry out in hysteria and blacken the streets with our vain panic? every mistake has a greater purpose--remember that. we are all mistakes, therefore, we will all rise. Duel one another until there is no rivalry left to rebel. we are going to rise, rise up. a breakdown is a transformation, we cannot forsake this law. let's be liberal-not lawless. one day there will be beauty in being a civilian.
     i'm not scared anymore. is that obvious? i'm not. because i no longer feel compelled to be a shepherd, ashamed to be a sheep, sinister to be a goat. because god lives in me you know. he's not anything like your god, because he's invested in me(and i'm giving god a sex because it's just easier to type that way). he doesn't have to forgive me, because he knows who i am, and i didn't make myself this way. so i'm not scared. it's not my fault, so it's okay to believe. this am what is wanted, i just have to reach deeper. justice is not punishment, it is worth. i've only prayed when i've lost all hope. it might have worked, all i know is my god has no wrath. Respect, not worship. Appreciation, not devotion. i like that, it's comforting. is that immoral to feel that safe?

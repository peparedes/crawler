"event","You fall onto me.
You kiss my arms ever so sweetly.
You caress me and melt away so gently.
Your soul falls into the crevices in the bends of my arms.
Into my pores you pour yourself.
Meshing with my insides.
You beautiful glimmering thing.
You melt away.
You, so beautiful and pure, melt fast away.
Cold and refreshing, I feel you on my skin.
Each moment is sweet.
You magnify this world--
You make every color their true, vivid hue.
Without you, this world is lifeless and unliveable.
Please, kiss me again.
Through the air and puddling on this skin encasing.
You fall away.&nbsp; You plunge to the ground.
You sweetly say goodbye.
Cascading down my arms and running down my legs.
My limbs cry for you, and you sweetly kiss them bye.
Glowing, glorious, beautiful, shimmering.
You are so wondrous, rain drop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cracking through the sky.
You pour your anger down on us.
Your rage is magnified throughout the fermament.
What is your poison?&nbsp; I want to ask.
You continue to grow.
You're fierce.&nbsp; You fight.&nbsp; You growl.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You throw your hands at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Damn you.
Blades of fire cutting through this ice.
Cutting through this smoke of life.
You cut me deeply.
To my soul--through this meek and pitiful dermis.
Breaking through this exterior--you break me down.
You throw your hard, wretched, ferocious anger down upon me.
I glare at you.&nbsp; I take you in.
I drink you down to your backwash essence.
You are nothing,
You are nothing but a little bully.
Growling at me.&nbsp; Still.
I cave.&nbsp; I give in.&nbsp; Stare and think not of you.
I listen to you.&nbsp; I digest you.
I revel in your beauty.
You are amazing.
Your voice is of the deepest timpani;&nbsp;
Your songs rage on in low bass.
You know your rage.&nbsp; You know your power.
You, beast, are nothing but a weak, feeble child.
You pour out your anger and your sadness.
You want to be hollow.&nbsp; I open my soul and let your sadness dig in.
Fall into me, and let me hold you.
I watch you--graceful and poetic.
Your tears fall down on me in streams.
They cover my body and carress my soul.
They run down me and kiss me all over.
I let your tears fal into the meager crevices of my body, soul, and heart.
They fill the spaces that are empty.
I convert your anger and rage into substantial energy.
I breathe you in.
You are beautiful.
You scream loud and forceful.
Let it go.
Let it out.
Pour down onto this earth with your firey passion.
You cut again through the sky.
Blade after blade.
Slicing and ripping and breaking this mold.
I absorb your energy.&nbsp; You are so pure.
Your essence, bold and powerful, ignites inside me.
I watch you, little child."

"event","Turbulent winds toss me. 
They throw me far. 
They break my bones 
And shatter my meager life. 
I cry out in pain. 
I look to the sky: 
It's too hazy. 
The dust is in my eyes. 
The tiny particles burn-- 
I writhe in pain. 
The sun burns my dermis black. 
I peal back the crust. 
The crust that covers me. 
My insides are out-- 
I am exposed. 
My muscles glare back at me in the ripples 
The tiny ripples of the pond. 
This body--this face? 
Who are you?&nbsp; What is your purpose? 
What do you want? 
The tears fall. 
They bounce into the shimmering pool. 
The lake gives me no answer. 
I am alone. 
I&nbsp; reach forward-- 
I reach into the placid, aqueous beauty. 
I reach for her with my broken bones, 
With my fragile muscles, 
WIth my crusty flakes of skin 
The crusty flakes sticking to my exposed. 
She pulls away. 
Or does she?&nbsp; Do I want her to? 
Do I want solitude? 
She winces at my pitiful form. 
This creature--fragile and broken-- 
Is it worth of love? 
Is it worthy of a gentle caress? 
The spew of water onto my face-- 
It teases me. 
I want to jump in. 
I&nbsp;want to cleanse myself, 
Rid myself of the friable flakes stuck in the grooves of my muscles. 
I jump. 
The water becomes my aloe. 
The flakes melt away. 
It rebuilds my bones; 
It gives me new, 
Fresh, soft, 
baby skin. 
I breathe it in. 
I inhale deeply. 
The liquid flows into my lungs. 
It gives me new life. 
It gives me hope. 
It shows me&nbsp; 
That I am alive. 
My heart, 
My soul-- 
They are broken. 
The memories live on; 
They burn inside me. 
The new skin, 
The sweet water, 
They cannot console. 
I am forever tormented 
By these memories. 
They eat away at me. 
I am forever torn down, 
Built up,&nbsp; 
Broken. 
This is my cycle. 
And I will endure. 

Swim."

"event","Cascading across your skin.
You glisten and glow.
You gather the heat from the day.
Your face--bent towards the sun.
Why are you so eager?
What do you have to say?
The world falls down--making you
Breaking you.
Reducing you to ash.&nbsp; Sand.
What have you.
You let me do with you as I please.
Set you in a row.
Build you up or break you down.
You still smile.
You still wait.
You stay there--
Letting your skin
Glisten in the flourescent glow."

"event","""Writing is very easy.&nbsp; All you do is sit in front of a typewriter keyboard until little drops of blood appear on your forehead.""&nbsp; --Walter W. ""Red"" Smith

I love that quote; I'm not sure why, but I absolutely love it.&nbsp; I found this little thing in my ""Writing with Style"" book for English Comp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I have successfully completed my first 4-page paper.&nbsp; Whether or not you think that's a big deal, I'm not sure; however, I was happy with my work.&nbsp; I think I had a great idea; yet, I just needed to break it down to a precise point in order to break my writer's block.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Week two here at GSH is almost over; we're having midterm break this weekend.&nbsp; WOO!&nbsp; I'm excited to eat something other than this horrible cafeteria food.&nbsp; I think we probably need to venture outside of the cafeteria for something to eat; Austen's anyone????&nbsp; Although, if they have the mashed potatoes again, I'm there.&nbsp; heh.&nbsp; A nice tip:&nbsp; don't eat the vegetables.&nbsp; They're bland and they make me sick.&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; And, the broccoli had wayyyy too much pepper in it.&nbsp; I almost gagged.

I think I've gotten into a rhythm finally.&nbsp; After lunch I've been writing poems in this little circle of benches in the quad.&nbsp; It's not as hot there, and the trees are nice.&nbsp; I'm going out on a limb--I'm going to post it.

Falling forward into the water.
The wetness kisses my skin--
Submerged.

Weightless and flying-
The cool water washing&nbsp;
Over my hot skin.
Pulling me down.

Visions of the future
Wipe across my eyes
Swim in my thoughts.
I let go.

I embrace my enw home.
The sea life beam at me.
I wave at the ghosts.
Ghosts of the sea.
They&nbsp;embrace me
And tell me their secrets.

The current wisks me away.
It takes me to far away dreams.
I succumb.
I breath in the salt water.
I let it cleanse my soul.
Burning in my veins.

The octopus smiles at me
And wraps me in its tentacles.

I think I'll stay here and brood awhile.



Well, I'm off to read more of my Writing with Style.&nbsp; I really can relate to a lot of what he has to say.&nbsp; Until later, my friends."

"event","Oh Butch.&nbsp; How I love thee; or not.&nbsp; You're a little too obnoxious for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

ANYHOW.

Governor's school...&nbsp; I've been here for a little over a week; it seems to be enjoyable.&nbsp; The classes are fun (when one does not have writer's block, that is); people are nice; the food is getting better.&nbsp; Overall, I'd say my experience thus far is going well.

I'm taking Masterpieces of Music, and I am now in love with Dr. Kolwinska's teaching style.&nbsp; Our homework is minimal, and the class itself is quite enjoyable.&nbsp; I was, honestly, wishing I had chosen Religious Studies; however, I think this class will prove condusive to my education in ways other than a lack of homework.

English Comp.&nbsp; Oh, you nasty devil, you.&nbsp; I have commenced writing on my first five-page paper.&nbsp; This, indeed, is a task fit for only those who are brave of heart.&nbsp; My writer's block completely kicked me in the ass with this one; I had a steady stream of creative energy going during my music paper.&nbsp; Suddenly, and without warning, it decided to just stop and hate me.&nbsp; I got teenie, tiny spurts of whatever ""creative juice"" there happened to be left.&nbsp; Although, I did have a few nice ideas during class today that I could expound on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I don't have much else to say on the subject of GSH.&nbsp; I suppose I could tell you all about the interesting Club Laundry that came into existence Friday night.&nbsp; I have to say, it was much more enjoyable than Club Basement.

CLUB LAUNDRY &gt; CLUB BASEMENT.

'Nuff said.&nbsp; The people here are interesting.&nbsp; I've met some great kids; I've met some interesting kids; I've met some atypical governor's school kids.&nbsp; I've met lots of people.&nbsp; Although, I will say I like them all.&nbsp; They're pretty good.&nbsp; Yeah, they're good.&nbsp; Ahaha.

Well, I need to write this paper and perhaps do whatever assignment I have to do in Eng.&nbsp; Till later, lovelies.

"event","Congratulations to me for actually moving my blogs--er, journals--to a suitable place.&nbsp; Myspace is a tad bit too pretentious by any means.&nbsp; 

Well, I have one week until Governor's School commences.&nbsp; Hoorah?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; I'm beginning to like the idea of spending five weeks with actually semi-intelligent beings.&nbsp; It'll definitely be a change from the empty-headedness I swim in at school.&nbsp; It'll be a nice thing for me considering it will be semi-close to college.&nbsp; I will be thrown into a sea of people I don't know; I'll be dealing with living amongst people; I will learn to deal with rowdiness; and I'll learn to share.&nbsp; Being an only child does have its perks, and it does have its downsides when it comes to learning to deal with people.&nbsp; 

Geh, I don't have anything great to say, so I'll leave my first journal unsuccessful.&nbsp; Perhaps the next one will be a bit more entertaining.&nbsp; Ciao!"

"event","Feeling sad.
Went to a bbq yesterday for a uni thing, it was held at my ex's house through his housemate.  I havent been in that house in over a year and havent seen him in about six months.  When i got there my ex wasnt there and you see in the last year i have changed in appearance so much that his housemate hasnt even made the connection.  Anyway looking around i spotted his new girlfriend who i found out just by listening that she now lives with them :(  It was when she said that she left her keys upstairs i knew she was his girlfriend because his room is upstairs.  Anyways what is worse is that when my ex finally rocked up he didnt acknowledge me.  I dont think you can NOT recognise someone you were once with and only saw six months ago...BASTARD.  Yes i could have gone up and said hi, but i didnt want to be rude and interrupt his canoodaling with his new girlfriend. I could have also been rude when his girlfriend asked who i was and how i knew people there and said...""well lets just say i know the size of your boyfriend's...""  BUT I DIDNT!  I guess that i am sad because when i was with him i was a baby, just 18, naieve and we definately at that stage were at two different points in our life.  I had just started uni (literally met him in my first month of uni) and he had just finished uni and started a full time job.  I broke up with him believing that i was holding him back from finding someone that would be more suitable.  I know i was but now that he has found someone more suitable some part of me still wishes that i could have been the one.  I guess everytime i see him it just raises doubt about my worth.  I dont see him as any extraordinary person, actually after the way he treated me and made me feel on some occasions, i rate him as pretty average.  Therefore when i think that if i wasnt good enough for him, who does that make me :("

I got ocamp leader so pretty stoked about that and have just started a training program for youth fm at three D radio 93.7fm.  I think that it is a great foot in the door to help build skills since it is looking rather doom and gloom with Student Radio and VSU :(  Anyways three D will be a bonus on top of C31.  Am planning to post fun flood pics on my flickr journal but what do you know...cable to connect camera to computer is in storage, already been there for a month, no doubt will still be there in another.  Another set back is that it is reccommended that you dont lay new floors for at least three months so concrete can dry out!  Yay (please tell me you picked up the sarcasm in my voice)!"

Yes, unfortunately i live on first creek and when it started pouring the creek started rising and rising and rising until we had over half a metre of water through parts of our house!

One week on and the industrial cleaners have managed to suck the inch of mud left throughout the house, but the council, lets just say the council have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to remove the 1/2 foot of rank fermenting sludge that surrounds our house!

NORWOOD, PAYNEHAM and ST PETERS COUNCIL...SHAME ON YOU, YOU SHIT HEADS!

You want to hear a funny story...we were offered by our council an Afgani Refugee to come and shovel the mud and for us to pay him cash in hand.  We rang the council because the job was too mamoth for our who family to shovel.  What's worse is that these poor refugees come all the way out hear on a boat to be exploited more by our motley barge ass council.  Where's his super and health benefits in that under the table transaction that equated to a sum far below any wage i would work for to shovel shit (that's what the mud looks and smells like, therefore i equate it to!)

I rest my case, 
(only because my internet time has run out as i sit at a computer in the library because our insurance man decided to take annual leave in the middle of our claim, so there is no internet, let alone computer, let alone computer desk, let alone keybord to use).

What a whinge but i feel so much better!"

My mum is crying asking what she ever did wrong as a parent, my dad still doent know (he is the type that hates the fact that i work in a pub because of the smoke!) so you can just imagine how he is going to be (not to mention that my sister and dad are at wars any way).  Worste of all my mum found out through the grapevine.  Could it get any worse???!!!

Dont get me wrong, i dont have a problem with tats, actually i quite like the art a lot of my friends have, but when it is impulsively stained on your skin at an age where it will no longer be cool in a year, I have a problem!

I just want to know if it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to get a tat?  I thought if you were under age you had to be accommpanied by an adult?

"event","What an interesting revelation i just was informed of.  One of my close friends at work is going out with my cousin (using the word liberally). Well he's not technically my cousin but his grandmother and my grandfather (were teenage sweethearts when they were young) reconnected when they both became widowed and have been living together for the past 8/9 years.  We have adopted her like a new grandmother but we really havent had much to do with her side of the family.  Her grandson, which i could probably remember meeting 5 times max is now going out with my good friend.  How bizare!!!!

This is so weird because i didnt recognise him the last two times i met him, and it was his grandmother of all people who made the connection.  It also now means that i cant be honest with her, because i know she is going to grill me to find out everything about him and i cant say a thing.  Although we are not blood related or anything remotely close, everything i know is family stuff, the kind of stuff that stays in family confidence.  Life just got a whole lot weirder!

This is not to mention that when i first met him i thought that he was quite a catch.  OMG i feel dirty!"

I love how you throw a whole bunch of people together who dont really know each other, and after a few drinks they are all best friends.  Now we all sit together in lectures, talk afterwards, and only a week ago we didnt even know each others names! 

Also on the pub crawl was a guy i have had a crush on for god knows how long, probably too unhealthily long!  We finally met, shook hands and introduced ourselves (thanks to the help of one of the greatest friends ever).  I have a sneaky suspicion that he already know who i was but to avoid a lil arkwardness we played it like we were two strangers.  I really hope i was a stranger to him.  My heart was beating so fast, and it is so hard to try to keep it all cool when for the first time in almost a year of longing (longing stopped when in a relationship but quickly resumed after) i finally got to the meet the man that had appeared to me in so many of my dreams (dont get dirty on me people).

The only problem is though, is that i have out grown my crush.  Dont get me wrong, i still the the guy is a lil spunk bubble but he just doesnt do it for me the way he used to.  Maybe ive just grown up and grown out of him, but none the less the interaction was just like the dreams. 

Went out sat night. I should have just gone to the cranker but wanted to meet up with people at north adelaide first.  THat didnt pan out so i rock up at the cranker in wanky clothes... if you saw a brushed gold belt and matching shoes then i am unfortunately admitting it was me.  Otherwise i was with the girl with long dark mahogany hair who was making out with some super dooper hotty which she took home and had wild sex with.  So happy for her, such a wasted night for me.  Oh well, at least there are some out there sharin a lil love!"

Have migrated to the Cranker as a fresh new place to hang out, every thurs and sat night...i wonder how long before the novelty wears off :|  

Have absolutely not been clubbing for that long i feel completely removed from the scene (what ever scene that is).  Ha Ha Ha heaven closed down, i laugh in one sence and then cry in another, because all of the heaven nomads have decended on all the other clubs in adelaide leaving them slightly tarnished...cant say i really understand the attraction of rats tail hair do's, kind of looks like they had it done by a blind hairdresser.  

Theivery Cororation, latest CD i bought.  THink i need to get my act together and organise to get involved with student radio.  I just try and think of what kind of show i would have and all that comes out is...blah.  Not much to work with really.

Dark blonde after having the red stripped out of my hair.
For a useless piece of information that no one really needs to know (not likely to be useful in any life threatening situation) is that red hair dye is the quickest colour to fade, but the hardest to get out of your hair.
I found that out the hard way after having to have it stripped.  Five hours later i had a new head of hair.

I called my friend for her birthday (the one i havent spoken to in a year) and it felt like we had nothing to say to each other.  Made it a quick call because she had family over to dinner.

I havent seen her for over a year, none of my old school frinds have (she still exists though!).  

I now dont know whether to call her out of the blue for her birthday?  I mean i am looking at this from two perspectives.  First, she may think why havent i called her in all this time and am only calling for her birthday.  The other is that it takes two to tango.  I havent heard from her, she has made no effort to make contact.  How long do you put effort into things like this?

After a big friday night i had to be up early to meet a couple of people i am doing an assignment with to nut out some stuff.  I thought that since i was going to their house i should stop on my way to get something to take with me...

I gun down to the Parade and while i am driving i noticed that everytime i pressed my accelerator down it didnt seem to be coming back to meet my foot. I noticed it but didnt think much of it as the effects of the night before were more to contend with.  Anyways, as usual the parade is packed and i am driving around like a looney trying to find a park because the coles one was full.  I was driving down the parade and stopped at the lights outside of angus and robertson and when i went to accelerate, i went no where.  My accelerator pedal had sheared off the floor of the car, slipped down the rod, rotated and jammed backwards so i couldnt accelerate!  SHIT!  Lucky it is automatic so it has an automatic propulsion which allowed me to putt putt putt like a dickhead that looks like they are driving in first gear, into a parking space infront of the book store.

My car also has a few leaking problems, whenever it rains, water seems to cascade in from places i can never work out to fill by back seat flooring with a couple of centimeters of water, drip on my driver seat and rot the inside carpet upholstery.  Oh and lets not forget the little pool in my boot, add a few air jets and id have a portable spa.  This car is a friggin' gem...anyone want to buy?"

Although i am not running, i am doing the 'what friends do' thing and supporting one of my closest friends, but hell im stuffed.  

My recent ex wont leave me alone, not in a bad way but not in a good way either.  I will hear from him everyday, without fail.  After being ready to cut me off dry because he thought that it would hurt less, i thought that it would be better to try the friends thing.  I just didnt expect my 'friend' to call or message me everyday for no particular reason other than to say hi.  Oh boy for some reason i think i brought this on myself, but i just saw it as such a waste to throw it all away and then never speak to each other again.

It doesnt feel like he is checking up on me but i definately feel some kind of emotional dependance that i am so not up for or needing, it was one of the reasons i broke up with him, he became clingy.

There are two places in Sydney where my inspiration stems from...The Victoria room and the Establishment (google them to check out what they look like).  I just wish there was a place in Adelaide that everyone could go to an feel comfortable.  I say this because i notice when i go out how segregated Adelaide is and this saddens me because we are already so small...

I was at the Cranker on Sat night and as we were going in, these girls walked past on the way to the exchange in their clubbing outfits and copped a whole heap of derogatory shit from some guys sitting outside.  Although the girls did look a little funny wearing mini skirts in what felt like sub zero temperatures, i dont think that anyone on their night off should have to endure that kind of unwarranted verbal abuse.

Then at the end of the night we were outside the stag waiting for a taxi and there were other people also waiting.  A taxi came around the corner and pulled up infront on my friend and i instead of this other group.  As we got in, one of the guys harped on about us being sluts.  Where the fuck does he get off?!  Does anyone understand what im essentially getting at?  Why is adelaide so damn segregated and nasty?  Are we all just a bunch of inadequate shits that dont want to get along?  I would like to think not, i just think that all our hang out joints are refined to attract one 'type' of person and then strongly exclude another.

Yes there is comfort in being surrounded by members of society that you identify with, but does that mean we shut out everyone else?  Because to me this seems like what we tend to do here."

I regretted it as i stood at the bus stop waiting for my bus, thinking that i could be talking to them right at that moment.  I just dont understand myself sometimes, i really dont.  I dont think that anyone is better than another person, unless you have killed or tortured someone...then my view of you tends to change.  But for some reason i just felt like i could not go up and speak to them.  This strikes me quite strongly because usually i will try and strike up a conversation with anybody and everybody.  WHat is the cause behind this.  Maybe because i feel that one of the persons sitting on that bench is amazing cool and she is unbelievable popular around campus.

Back at uni and loving it, I love doing media now, i love the people that are in it and the style...i think that i have finally found my calling!  Have not however done any of the readings yet, am going to do them later today...promise :|

I have a new relationship that i am happy in even though i know that it will not be forever.  You can call me pessimistic, but i prefer to call it realistic when it comes to the heart.  Somethings you just know...i know that this is not a keeper however i am enjoying every single second of it and will remain optimistic that i will break my three month relationship record with him.

I am trying to build up the courage to tell my parents (my mum at least) that i am staying at his house because i dont want to lie to them.  My little house of cards nearly came crashing down last night when after saying that i spent the night at a friends house (as a cover) we went out out again and when her parents picked me up my dad started talking to them.  I nearly died in the back of the car...i was waiting for my dad to thank them for letting me stay the night.  Oh my god, that was way too close and something i am reading as a sign!

The problem is that when first told my mum about the whole situation (his past, his age) my mum was kind and honest enough to say that although she cant stop me, she would prefer if i kept the relationship as friends and not partners.  I kind of feel like i would be letting her down though if i told her we were together.

So at the moment i am unfortunately lying to them, which makes me feel really bad because usually i tell my mum everything and everything that i dont tell her she usually picks up on and guesses.  In a way then i am also hoping that maybe she already knows and is just not going to bring the issue to a head.

I dont know, i am just a bit confused and a bit tired, so i will tie up this entry having now given sustenance to my starving child (my journal)

Started back at uni yesterday and fell asleep in my first lecture, good start me thinks to the start of another mind boggling semester.  I am however stoked to be doing media now and am absolutely loving it.  I know that it may sound a little too forth coming, but when you work so hard to achieve something and then finally get it...lets just say i havent had that feeling for a long time and the hard work feels worth it.

We shot our pilot on monday for the new show around adelaide.  They're a great group of people that i am working with and so it was really easy and not stressful! 

Have curbed the nightly town dwelling...well almost.  Went to the elephant last night and it was really good.  There is a band comp on at the moment running (i dont know how many weeks - Check out the ad in Rip it Up) but there is $500 up for grabs and there was an awesome 9 piece funk/rock/jazz group playing...these guys would not be much older than 19/20/21 and they fuckin rocked the place.  Its scary to think that if they are this good at this age, what does the future hold...

I am still trying to work out what the definition of love is. I cant say that i have ever experienced it in a relationship (besides family and friends) before, and so when someone tells you that they love you, i am still at a loose end as to how to reply.  I am hoping that it is something that just dawns on you one day...and then you know.

I get scared when partners become really affectionate so early in a relationship. I mean dont get me wrong, it is a wonderful thing, but i think that i am scared of setting myself up to be hurt.  By letting them in and allowing them to mean something to me means that i will definately feel something at the end...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

We should all be very proud that an Adelaide community television show won 'best variety show' at the antenna awards last weekend.  This is a big thing for local community television and new shows may soon be hitting C31, so keep tuned...

Bad luck for local noise...it was a great show and it would be great to have it back on the air...*hint hint* *nudge nudge* boys and girls at student radio...i'll even offer my help to get it back on track.  It was up against some pretty good interstate competition, but if you stay in the game who knows what could happen next year!!!

All for now.

I have tapped into a person that has been hurt, that is scared and that needs love.  I want to prove to him that the world is not a bad place, that you can trust and that you dont need to live in fear because no matter how well you try and avoid it, there is no escaping pain.  He is a rough exterior yet so tender and vulnerable  inside.  

I have never come across a body and mind so broken, and i feel so much empathy.  He opens up, feels safe in my arms and he is.  But i feel that i am not old enough to give him what he wants.  He wants a relationship.  At the moment i am just not ready to dive completely in.  I have told him this.  I also dont want to break him anymore.  I want to help him by being with him, i enjoy being with him, i long for him when he is not with me, yet i dont want to hurt him when i go.

I have to stay realistic, i will not marry him nor have his babies, and then i feel like if i know that i should avoid him to let him find that person.

He writes a lot of things down, he has written a lot about me, he lets me read this, and i feel so sad.  A mind so desperate to escape the darkness of his past and i feel so much pressure to live up to his expectations.  I dont want to fail him, hurt him, damage him...

Am i therefore wrong to stay with him.  I feel that i can help him, get him back on track, help him see that life is a beautiful thing not a nightmare.  I have never had anyone open up to me like he has before, i feel privilaged that he has let me in, i feel privalaged that he will let me help...

Normally i am scared of being hurt, never until now have i felt scared to be the hurter."

Went and saw a band play in the city who my friend&nbsp;is good friends with.&nbsp; After god knows how many pints of pale and vodka lemon limes for the first time in my life i was cut off from the bar!!&nbsp; It was because of&nbsp;our dancing style, most of our moves ended up with&nbsp;us on the floor.&nbsp; I must admit life is pretty cruisy when ""your with the band""...you get drink vounchers!&nbsp; Anyways here's the first revelation of this crazy week, the bass player and i hit it off.&nbsp; It was however not until the end of the night that we realised that we knew jack shit about each other...and to my surprise i found out that he is 31.&nbsp; Looking at him&nbsp;i put him at 24/26 and thought yeah i can deal with that...but 31?&nbsp; Anyways we left it at that, i was pretty done and so i retired home ALONE (calm down).</P>
<P>Wed night went to a friends house, nice to catch up, very late night none the less...</P>
<P>Thurs night went to friends house, planned to be quite movie night but other friends dropped which i havent seen for ages so ended up being a huge catch up till wee hours of morn.</P>
<P>Fri had to work then headed to house party which migrated into town, friend and i didnt feel like hitting the dance floor so went to supermild and chilled to mountain fresh and vodka martini's with four olives from very nice bar tender...tell me what is his name, the short dark haired one?...i have a secret crush on him Shhhhhhh!</P>
<P>Then sat night was a corker...if you were a PJ's you will know what i am talking about...if you were there let me know, i probably have a lot of explaining to do :|&nbsp; stumbled through the door about 6:30 and slept straight through til 1pm got water went back to bed and slept till i had to go to work that night.&nbsp; Blame it on the band!</P>
<P>Then last night would have to be the most insane experience of my life so far.&nbsp; Working in a pub i unfortunately have become accustomed to the old biff between the blokes, however until last night i had never seen someone knocked out cold before.&nbsp; Had finished work and as each of us knocked off we stuck around and threw back a few bevies.&nbsp; One drink, 2,3,4.&nbsp; When this guy was knocked out however, i had to administer first aid (roll on side, maintain a clear airway etc).&nbsp; There was blood on the floor, in his mouth and yeah yuck, and the insane thing is that although i'd had a few and was having a fab time, as soon as this happened its like the alcohol doesnt exist any more because all you are focused on is the situation.</P>
<P>I must admit that i am disappointed how many people dont know simple life saving first aid, kind of common sense stuff.&nbsp; It scares me actually that myself and another guy (both with alcohol pumping through our system) were the only two that knew what to do until the ambos and police came!</P>
<P>Other thing is that person knocked out was prominant and well known member of society...so dont think bad bar fights dont happen in your suburb, because it just happened at mine!</P>
<P>Proceeded to drink further after that (i believe that i had a very valid excuse), came home, talked to mum about it for quite a while because i was kinda shaken from the image of when he came too...his eyes bolted open...i can still see them :(&nbsp; Didnt get to sleep till about 4 (thinking about what had happened that night and what to do with cute ass bass player). Woke up with hell bad hangover :(</P>
<P>Tonight my liver rejoices (i can hear it) because first night in week it has not had to deal with alcohol.&nbsp; God that bad, this sounds like im a 19 year old alco. help me help me !!!!!!</P>
<P>Thankyou lj for letting me vent, i really needed to get that off my chest and out of my head.</P>

<P>Public displays of affection...although i am not comfortable to walk around with some guys hand on my butt or playing tonsil tennis over dinner, i respect that some people are and so i humbly grin and bear it...until last night.</P>
<P>At work we shut the kitchen at 9pm, so at 8:57 a drunk woman around 45 come up to me telling about her night and her indecision on whether or not to order food. Somehow between a rump steak and raviolli she starts telling me about how much she loves Wobbie (i am guessing it is pronounced Robbie), then all of a sudden Robbie appears and they start touching and kissing and all that shit at the couter in front of me!! She is kissing him on the lips and speaking to me at the same time. As i said before usually i grin and bear this shit, but i am not paid to watch two middle aged people have it off like in some cheap porno less than a metre in front of me! </P>
<P>This has been a bad week for whinging. Demanding friends is another thing that has been grating this week too. I have one particular friend that is in a way possessive and i hate it, rings me asking where i am and what i am doing (sorry chicky but most of the time it is really none of your business). Everytime we go out i end up having to baby sit her and it always ends up in tears (her crying). When i go out i dont want nor need that. It is my time off from the world and i like it that way.</P>
<P>I move in many different social groups, depending on how i am feeling and the social connection i feel like at the time (pub friends, club friends, movie friends, relationship problem friends, music friends). You couldnt put them all in the same room and expect them to get along famously or at all. She doesnt understand this or is ignorant to accept this...i dont know but i am getting tired now of both trying to deflect a lot of manipulative moves she is trying to pull...i see straight through, none the less it is still tiring!</P>
<P>Cant be bothered dwelling on the fact, too draining.</P>
<P>My photo blog is up and running, if you want to check it out (just a few pics from my trip to cairns) go to <A href=""http://www.flickr.com/people/blusonic"">www.flickr.com/people/blusonic</A> -let me know what you think!</P></FONT>"

"event","My brain is a mess, i have been exposed to so much this week my head actually hurts reminiscing on the week that was and the weekend that is to be.

Last night i had two horrible dreams (1) Our pigeon got run over twice on out street...why he didn't fly away?  (2) Rocket launch went wrong...i am owing that to seeing the Columbia fire ball through the sky maybe 10 times in the last DAY!

I'm going to have a gripe...first of all to the people that pull out of plans at the 11th friggin hour!  I can deal with it quite well once, even swallow it a second time BUT 3 times and madame here has a problem.  If you broke your leg, no worries. Your grandpa died, i understand.  You dont feel like it, MAJORLY PISSED. I hate when i finish work early, call a friend that i have made prior arrangements with and am informed they are in their pj's after having a change of heart.  I also would like to know why being broke all of a sudden became an excuse, we are all broke, im broke (however not as broke as djcassar initially interpreted), it never stopped us going out before, why now?

I hate people with secret agendas.  To your face they are all airy fairy, all is well but in fact they have a problem with you, see you as a threat.  I hate it when you can see it, they read like a psychology textbook, this is even worse and hurts even more when they are one of your friends :(  I see this now, i see this in one of my friends and i am sad.  I hate competition, to the point where i try and avoid all competitive activities.  I dont want to compete with friends, i dont want a friend to be jealous of a relationship i have with another person, i dont want them to exclude me as a way of competing.  I thought this kind of behaviour was left in the playground. Why are people like this?  The worst part is when it comes from people you would never expect it from.  I am seeing a side of her i never expected and i am sad.

Nuff said on sad stuff, gotta stop whinging.

On a much much much brighter note I GOT INTO B.MEDIA!!!!!!!!!  I am unbelievably over the moon.  The last nightmarish (word i dont think exists) couple of months have paid off :)

Just a question...why dont hickeys hurt?  Think about it, someone sucks hard enough to burst lil blood vessels to the point where blood evidently pools under your skin in the form of a bruise and...i feel nothing?  

oooh, nearly forgot...have also started up a photo blog too!"

"event","I AM BACK!!!  Gosh it feels like such a long time, i read all of the journal entries and i feel so out of the loop.  Just got back from cairns this evening...first thing after i upacked bag was to check email and journal.  Crazy this obsession with technology!  My holiday was beatiful, i hate to rub it in but for the last week i have been walking around in thongs, shorts and singlet tops, and if i want to rub it in further there was also a day spent at the beach swimming, sunbaking and lying on the sand in nothing more than my bikini.  Yes that is right, less than 12 hours ago i was lying under a fan and now it is back to slippers and winter pj's...how can this be!!!

Cairns was full of European backpackers...yes girls and boys if you are interested in a lil Sven or Hilda...head north!  They are everywhere...Irish, English, Swedish, Scotish...

Another interesting thing to note is that there is a Pj O'briens, a Woolshed and a Shenanigans (dont know if i spelt them correctly), the point however being is that i didnt realise that they were a franchise...a very popular one at that (particularly the Woolshed for obvious reasons).

There was a ministry party held at the AJ Hackett Bungy jump grounds...here's the deal but...  AJ Hacket is surrounded by rainforest so you can just imagine the effects of all the fractured lasors and beam lights on the towering trees...it looked insane.  They hung the disco ball from the bungy platform so it looked like it was hovering over the plunge pool at the bottom. 

The turn out...600.  It was hailed by locals as a great event...my verdict...kind of like a night club that is only half full because the space could have easily fit over 1000.  IT was the most beautiful setting though, in the rainforest all lit up by deep purple beam lights and the reflections of the mirror ball...a true rainforest adventure!!! 6/10.  Know it sounds harsh but i just didnt dig it :(

Anyways all for now,
blu!"

"event","COLD!!! Sorry to state the obvious but i just am.  Life is so dull at the moment.  Am eating a chocolate chip muffin right at this moment to try any find some comfort to being holed up.  Last night was my third sat night in a row...my third weekend in a row that i have not been out. That's right, a habitual weekend warrior has been denied for nearly a month the pure pleasure of sipping vodka lemon limes (ok, guzzling them) in town at my favorite clubs.  And for what, well what better than for typing out end of semester majors (All left to the last minute).  Last night (sat) was no different.  Sitting in front of the heater on the recliner, in my pj's, under a blanket reading about asian medical systems.  Yes its a dry read, something i would definately not pusue in my spare time.  Whats worse is i was in bed by 12!!  I usually dont get to town before then!!

I leave for cairns next tues (28th) so stoked...$298 return flight with no accommodation expenses...party on!  Can you believe that in just over a week i will be replacing the scarves and hoodies for nothing more than a bikini and a heater for an airconditioner...not to mention swimming at the beach and soaking up the sun.  But wait there is more...sarah said that there is a Ministry party up there with Mark Dynamix hitting the decks.  Is this true?!?!  Oh i just cant wait..."

"event","Sitting at the desk at the station playing receptionist...oooh what fun!  My sister and i used to play games like this when we were kids...we would draw on a piece of cardboard and use it as a keyboard staring at the blank TV screen pretending in was a computer, use an old unplugged phone to take important calls from important imaginary people and scribble on pads of paper pretending to do doctors signitures (you have to admit they do look like scribble)...ooh and lets not forget the fighting about sharing the 'computer' and the phone.

Its the same at work, i handle thousands of dollars...real dosh this time, not like childhood games with monopoly money!

WE used to play check out chicks as well, open all the cupboards in the kitchen, line up all the cans and packets of food and buy them.  There were so many fights over who was the checkout chick.

Its amazing to think back to how much you wanted to do these things, how exciting you thought they were when you were kids compared to now when you are actually doing it how boring it is.  Taking peoples money, giving them real change...BORING.  Sitting at a receptionist desk, taking phone calls, writing memo's...just doesnt float my boat (Is that a naughty saying, oh well, who cares, even if it is it's true!).  There is one good thing, you do get to meet all these interesting people, with great ideas, busting with energy to share them.  I like that, i like people that look like there brain is going to explode because there are so many ideas swirling around...maybe because they remind me of me."

I also brought up the topic again (which i raised on fri night) that i am just not looking for a serious relationship unlike he who was. I mean don't get me wrong im all happy to have a relationship, but if we were to have one it had the wrong foundations...we know nothing about each other.  I've been down that track before, meet someone in a club...drunken hook up...end up going out...end up not compatible...BAM BAM relationship awkwardly down the drain with festering hostility.

I wasnt expecting a reply, but got one back saying that it was all cool and that he would see me around sometime.  Friend saw him in unibar today and all  is  cool, invited me to his birthday in a few weeks as a friend. All panned out and am so happy to be able to walk away with a friend from it!

D, hope all of your family troubles work out.  Em was so lovely to try to coax me down to see you today.  I am just scared that i wont hold myself properly around you, scared i would blush uncontrollably, salivate all over you with pupils the size of satellite dishes.

All the guys in the camping room...Sorry for the crotch grabbing.  You were the one's posting flyers printed 'boy's are easily excitable'. I was just trying to give credence to your statement.  

To the Indian guys on the balcony.  I apologise if i offended any religious or social standings when i proceeded to educate you in the art of moaning  well to make your partner feel like a sex god or goddess.  You all did so well, your moans were back tingling, lucky girls who get you...they will be elevated to Supreme sex beings! Go sex God: 1a, 2, 3 & 6!

Apologies to the group of girls who were at school a year below me.  I am sorry i took the ribbons out of your hair, but...ribbons are so knee high sock private school girl, NOT UNI BAR!  Burn the ribbons, actually burn your whole collection...Ok maybe save one for the naughty school girl party you will go to.  Then and only then is a ribbon permitted in the hair.  Until then go the bed hair...so hot right now.

But wait there is more...  
   -R, sorry i drank your beer when you went to the toilet.  It was going warm and it just seems like such a waste.  
   -M, sorry i dropped one of the sausages you bought on the floor.  I promise it didnt go to waste.  I simply picked it up, grabbed another piece of bread and ate it.  No worries!
   -A, i think you are lovely, but drunken hook ups are exactly that.  You seem so lovely but i just think its better if we dont...please dont call, its just easier that way.

I hope you can all forgive me?!?!

On another note...D where were you...Just to see you would have been enough?  Maybe it was better that way, maybe loss of inhibitions would have kicked in and i would have made a regrettable move.  (keeping atimetob's words of advice in mind...Thankyou!)

T...I think you are gorgeous.  Seriously considering a move to architecture...I'll make sure i get you to build my house ;)  Thanks for letting me check out your animation! It rocks/no pun intended

Em i am so glad i could help to get you to #4 :) Go girling! Wish you could have stayed out longer :(

D (another one) thankyou for being so hypothetically honest with me.  I didn't realise i drew that attention.  I think it is the hair.  Cut it off, colour it and BOOM :)

"event","Well off to see my gender studies tutor today, work out where the hell i am going wrong.  Has been a pretty non eventful week so far(even though it is only tuesday).  Had a good weekend went into town on sat night.  Went just about everywhere...that includes bar 108 on hindley street *cringe*  a couple of the girls and guys we were with had never been before.  We decided that a form of amusement would be to buy raffle tickets for all of the girls to try to win a lap dance...well we won...L grew the balls and took it, we all couldnt stop laughing, her face was priceless would have taken a picture if photos weren't banned.  Went to Elysium because line for Supermild was soooo long and it was freezing and then headed home at about 4am.

On another front i am in complete lust, with a person i know i shouldn't be.  I lust after everything about him, i love his style, his personality, his direction, his essence...only problem is that he is one of my ex's housemates and i dont even think he knows i exist.  Dont you just hate when you like someone so badly and they will never know how much.  Never ever know how you feel or that you probably even walk this earth.  Although he is 7 years older than me (god i know that sounds so bad, but he is still at uni) we still seem to move in similar circles and cross paths when we go out.  Clubs and bars, i can only shrink into a corner and observe him from a distance, for i know that making i move would be the biggest mistake of my life.  

Friends at uni know him and fill me in on more minor details...I have seen him sick, well, sad, happy, tired, drunk.  He is such a creative person, music, photography, activities...he keeps an amazing photographic journal on flickr.com.

Not hard to find for when you see it you will go W...O...W.

Got another of my ex's a gig at my friends sister's 21st.  He gave them heaps of discount because they dropped my name...but here is the crazy thing, i dont think i am invited becasue i dont really know her sister that well.  Oh well such is life, even though i really want to go, just to see him.  My bad.  Get over him girl, he wasnt worth it then, he isnt worth it now yet the heart still pines...

When your own mother remarks that you look like shit, somethings wrong!  I'm permanently cold, pale and tired...i mean really tired.  Notice that there are no entries in my journal before midday?!!? That would be because i am rarely awake before then.  And for all those crappy 9am lectures and tutes, i simply return home for another cat nap.  I have been dodging extra shifts at work that it is almost becoming a game!

Shapelle has received 20 years and i am also sad about that.  Guilty/innocent i dont find myself in a position to comment, our only insight into the case is through the media...and we all know how RELIABLE that one is [insert sarcastic face here].  There's a lot of holes in all the evidence and Balinese procedure so the only thing i will say is that Bali is not a place i plan on going to any time soon (if ever).  If i want tropical beaches, coconuts, palm trees, culture and cheap trinkets to bring home, i think i will find a place that doesn't have a firing squad.

Had street funk dance class tonight. OMG i didnt realise what a bad dancer i am. I have never participated in dancing classes in my life (actually i lie, when i was ten i joined in with my sister's ballet class for one day...hated the teacher, hated the wedgies from the leotard and HATED the gumby PINK JIFFIES!!! So naturally never returned). My coordination is shot...body rolls...ball chages...pops...digs?! They take a toll on the body, i am finding muscles in places i am questioning should have any! The only reason i head back there each week is because it is so fun.  Yeah we have a few of the wanna be Beyonce's with the lip gloss and head bands, but for the most part we are a mixed bag of girls and guys, mums and sons having a chunk of fun trying...i mean REALLY TRYING to dance!

Got an essay back today and went shit...I dont understand how in my second year subjects i can be doing so well and then in a first year subject i would be just scraping passes.  Bit f***ed up if you ask me (but then again who's asking!).  I appreciate that i'm not the best analytical essay writer in the world, but give me a break it's a first year subject...and gender studies, HELLO!!! Off to see my tutor next week, i bet that it's because i have not paid enough homage to feminist ideals in the essays. Yeah, there are particular social ideals and practices that oppress women, but i dont think that in the name of feminism women should rip off their bras and proceed to beat boys with them down Rundle Mall.

"event","Slightly confused.  Through friends at uni i have been propositioned to attend a political meeting at uni.  I am not sure what to do, i appreciate the role of political groups within the campus but i am also aware of all of the hostility and mudslinging that goes on between opposing groups.  The meeting i am going to represents my political beliefs, but i wonder how much of an active political stance i want to assume.  Some of my friends are so wound up in it all, have so many strong beliefs and the members in the groups are so tight.  Student elections are won and lost depending on the bartering of candidates between groups.  Politics i am realising is a huge part of social and uni life.  I have always been quite content to sit on the side lines, watch the mud slinging from a clean vantage point and then head to the ballots with my private vote.  I just don't know what i am getting myself into, i dont consider myself a member of a pack, i prefer the freedom...but then again is it time i started validating my personal opinions and start to actively stand up for what i believe in ?"

"event","Last night went into town, started at supermild, although quiet it was so nice to go and just chill.  In there was one of my ex's housemates which i am ashamed to say that i think is so cute to the point of munchable.  After guzzling 2 mountain fresh martini's to try and suppress urges to violate him (in a good way) on the dance floor we headed down to the Kava Hut. i had never been before and my curiosity could no longer be contained.  Went in and was ready to be hit with a really exotic cocktail of something...THINK AGAIN PEOPLE!!!  Presented with a huge tupperware container of what looks like muddy water, i asked a couple of guys at the bar what it was like, their reply '...well its a bit gritty, kind of like mud, it's not very nice, actually its quite terrible, that's why you have to skull it and they give you the wedges of orange to get rid of the foul after taste...' I was thinking by this point why the hell people would even try the stuff, let alone position themselves at the bar to down coconut shell after coconut shell!?  As a kava virgin i had to read this laminated print out about the effects i would feel and Blah Blah Blah.  Told the lovely bar lady to hit me with the shit and down it went.  My verdict...tastes like tree bark (or what i would imagine tree bark to taste like!)  It's made from crushed up kava bush roots (a good explanation for the woody flavour).  Did my mouth go numb, well no. Why...because although i live dangerously, i still play safely and opted for the weakest brew available.  Even though the kava fell amazingly short of any culinary delicacy worth serving at a dinner party (although you can buy the powder to make at home) it is an absolute must for everyone to go, have a coconut shell or two or three and experience what it is like to drink liquid weed.  While your there, i would also recommend having a strum on the in house guitars, beat of the bongo's or head out back to relax in the sand under the snake light palm tree!

Don't know whether i can be bothered going into town, so cold, so tired.  I can hear my bed calling me over the vodka lemon limes.  I'm also not in the mood to run into the past at his cd launch at my favorite club...I wonder if his new, beautiful, blonde girlfriend will be there???  You know im blonde too, i just cut it all off and dyed it red...when did that become a crime?"

"event","Aaaaaagh!!!!  Well that is just peachy, i guess i will not be heading into town tomorrow night!  I just got a message from one of my favorite clubs that one of my ex-boyfriends (that special one eyeryone hates to admit they have which you know you are over yet still manages to sting every now and then) is launching one of his new mix cd's.  Oh it's moments like these you need more than f**king Minties but rather a hole in the side of the road to appear, swallow you up for a couple of days and come out when it doesnt hurt so much :'(  I know i shouldn't let it get to me but it does.  Bad enough seeing him around town with his NEW beautiful girlfriend, on the doors and decks with his friends of my favorite watering and shin dig holes as well as on campus.  Oh boy it's turned out to be one of those shit nights...thank god it is only a few hours until i hit town, i can hear the vodka lemon limes calling me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Well after a day of trotting around this site, finally i think my journal is complete.  It isn't as snazzy as i would like but that is mainly due to my lack of technological mastery!  It's nearly friday, which means the weekend is finally upon us people!!!    Organised to go into town fri night, but besides the pubs, where's a good place to break it on down?? Any suggestions for a place that pumps? Sat night's in the bag, am working til around 11pm and then heading to a friends porn party...should be fun ;)!  Am still contemplating a night in town afterwards, god knows i need it, drink to the demise of yet another relationship. Some alcohol and fun loving uni friends should help me weather this storm...saturday night here i come!"

"event","I guess this is the grand opening of my first live blog...oooh how exciting!  I have never considered myself a person to keep a daily journal, but i must admit to keeping a little pink book, you know the one that you keep tucked out of sight, viewed by none and gets your inner most thoughts. I am one of those people that writes out how i am feeling...pieces of paper would litter my floor, stained with ink visualising my thoughts until i got my own computer which until now housed my venting space.  I tend to be a person that over analyses everything, particularly relationships!!!  Oh god, they will be the demise of me.  Boys are such interesting creatures, i love them, yet they play with my brain in the most insane way!  I guess this place is my headspace, since i find it an impossible task to think in a straight line most of the time, seeing my thoughts in words helps the processing for me, i don't know, am i the only one that feels like this?  I guess that is where my strong connection to music stems from...it helps express me, i love when i can find that one lyric or instrumental arrangement that encapsulates exactly how you feel at the time!

Best part of the day so far...finished uni early and have the rest of the day off (rare as hens teeth for me) usually i have a camera operation course that i go to for a couple of hours and then straight to work.  Believe me i shall enjoy this five minutes of sanity, and yes, i promise to use it wisely!

Worst part of day so far...well i guess its the issue that i think one of my closest friends is pissed off with me for my slight lack of enthusiasm for her first notable 'sexual' experience.  The guy's a user, well affiliated within the uni and i see her as vulnerable.  Sometimes in life you have to let people you love make mistakes and learn the hard way.  That's the way i've done it and my oh my have i had some learning curves!"

So while Pete n I were waitin for her to call we got bored n figured Erin couldn't chill cuz it was like 9:30ish, so we went to the Strip Club. The gentlemen's Club to be exact. N no Amanda nasty ass Lacasse or however her last name is spelled doesn't work there anymore, THANK GOD! So we were there for like an hour n a half-ish, I lost track of time lol, n it was GREAT. There was this one Goth-like stripper there that singing along with the Tool n APC songs they were playin while she was on stage both times. So she automatically got extra points for knowing Tool lol. I got like 3 lapdances from her n she smelled SOOOO great. I smell like her now :) I would say how something else smelled but u get the drift...lol....So Good! God it was great. But I didn't have enough to get a private dance from her.........But Pete did! That asshole lol. but after his dance we left n I smell like hot stripper right now. The best smell ever lol. Well one of the best. So in conclusion I'm horny n wish I could make a booty call

I haven't found any recent proof so I hope that's fuckin done with. Matt is being childish and dumb but I'm not even gonna bother gettin into that retarded shit. My mom had surgery on thursday to see if she has breast cancer and we found out today that she does. I don't want to lose my mother. She's the closest thing to me in my life. I love her so much. I don't know how bad her cancer is but she will have to go for Chemo or however u spell it n have more surgery. I hate how my mom has yet another sickness to deal with now. My family and I r making her quit smoking n I honestly can say that there's no way I will be able to anytime soon. I wish I never started but with all this fuckin stress I have I won't have anywhere near the amount of will power to do anything but smoke n drink. I'll have to work of course. but I won't be able to stop smoking that's for god damn sure. I can't stand how shit has to happen all the time to my family. I know everyone has there problems n shit but with all the problems we have right now, this tops it all, and topples everything over. I wish I had help. I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I had someone period. And most of all I wish my Mother wasn't sick at all, I wish she'd jus become completely healed n be abl to do everything she used to. I'd give anyhting for that..............."

"event","Well tonight fuckin blew!!!!!!!! I punched out of work at 12:00 am EXACTLY, and I walk up to the front to leave n come home n try to fall asleep ASAP cuz I have to be in for 10 am so I'd like to be up at 8 so I don't have to rush around to get ready. BUT NO!!!!!!!!! No one is in the store, all the doors r locked and the alarm is going off......so annoying! So I call my ma n tell her what happened n she called the cops so they don't think Imma crazy gun-toting maniac robbing Stop & Shop.....Cuz I wasn't robbing it, I was locked the fuck in! Then 5 mins later, Some guy from a security office or some shit calls the front desk n asks what's goin on. I told him what happened n he told me he was gonna try to get a hold of someone to get me out n shit or get a hold of the manager. So like 15 mins goes by and the cops show up, but they can't really do anything but sit n watch me reading my Maxim magazine through the windows. Then at like 12:30 or 12:40 the security office guy calls n tells me he got a hold of the manager that locked me out, n he's on his way back to the store. So I sit n wait til 12:50 n the police department calls the store n asks if I knew where an emergency exit is n if I could go out it. I said ""I guess"" n asked if I would get in trouble by the store for leaving without the manager bein back. The lady tells me that they talked to the security office guy n he said he didn't know when the manager would get back n she kept tellin me in a round about way that, People were I guess calling and complaining about the alarm goin off n on, cuz it kept goin on n off. So I said ok n wrote a note to one of the managers sayin I got locked in the store for 50 mins. n I wanna get paid for it n walked out the fire exit in back. The first officer drives through the back n stops me n asked what happened exactly n I told him n then I started to walk home n the 2nd officer drove up n turned out to be Glen Felton a family friend n the coolest cop in Meriden. So I told him what happened n we laughed about it a liln he radioed some guy n told him I was out of the store n goin home n they were gonna wait for the manger to get there to turn off the alarm. The guy on the other end said ""We rn't gonna worry about the managment"" n I guess told the officers to leave. So I left n saw Glen n the other cop drive by. So if I get in trouble for not stayin Imma be pissed, If I don't get paid for the time I was locked in for Imma be pissed, N if I in any trouble whatso ever, Imma be fuckin pissed. So that was my shitty night. So great. Go ahead n finish laughing at it. Everyone else was. Well Imma go TRY to fall asleep so I can not feel like extreme shit when I wake up at 8.

When she's happy, it's great. When she's upset, it blows hardcore. I jus want things to be ok for her. Allan n Loryl r back to their Fighting, bitching, ""I love you"" bullshit whatever the fuck. Suprising huh? Haven't hung out with DAn n Matt lately. Been too busy. Work and when I'm not working I'm writting, makin beats, or recording. Pete, Cathlick, and I recorded a song last Saturday. Came out ok but it's jus a rough copy for now. I miss Ashley. I feel like a fuckin asshole tho. I haven't really talked ot her much at all n have kinda been ignoring her. I guess I was running away from gettin hurt. I know I care a lot about her, but things always seem to get so complicated, and she seems to change her mind as to how she feels about me a lot. Ummm I'm pissed at some people right now but not gonna go into it right now. I'll jus say I don't like Allan at all anymore. And it pisses me off cuz I was at Mysti's house this morning from like 130 to 400 n he came out n I saw him out of the corner of my eye n saw his hand out, but I thought it was Tim n I reached my hand up to see what he wanted n it was Allan goin to give me dap so I jus kinda said, ""Oh hi"" n like barely touched his finger at all. Ummm....Works been ok I guess. Real boring tho. Some co-workers r pissin me off tho. ICP pissed me off with their latest release ""The Calm"". It bloes and they r singin all over it. They sound dumb as fuck, n we all know how dumb fuck sounds, lol. Ok i'm tired so I'm goin to bed. I'll try to update more when I wake up.

"event","So tonight I got into a fight with my ""dad"" n punched him in the face :) It all started when, i found out he's still talkin n prolly still seein that cunt lois n so i took his cell and deleted everything off it n changed his wallpaper to me flippin him off lol. So when  i came home from Dan's I gave him his phone back and then he asked me y i did it so i asked him y he lied to me. He of course denied everything n then said i couldn't go on the computer anymore n i was on the phone with ashley whole this was goin on n i told her what he said n then called him a dumb asshole. So he came at me n grabbed my arms n pushed me into the sink so i pushed him off of me n told him to hit me or fuck off so he pushed me into the sink again so i punched him in the face n then in the head cuz he put up his arms to cover his face. Then my ma got in the middle of us n my sister came down so i let the cat out of the bag n told everyone that Mike's (I'm callin him Mike from now on cuz he's not my dad anymore) been cheating on my mom. While I was at Dan's with Mike's cell I called the whore n left 3 messages on her voice mail. After my Sister found out she called n left one n then called again n actually got a hold of her n threatened her a lot lol. So I guess she told Mike that she's bringing the messages to the cops. I dunno if she actually did or not but we'll see. My ma said she pretty much knew but basically didn't have the proof and my sister wanted to believe my dad sooooo much but she's disowned him jus like I have. I dunno if she's gonna call him Mike too but I know it pisses him off that I do lol :). I'm not sure if my parents r staying together or not or what's gonna happen but I know my ma said she needs to pay off some bills first b4 anything's in stone lol. Oi Vei huh? God I wish my ma didn't get in the middle of me n Mike cuz I so wanted to keep goin n kick the shit out of him. But at least I got some punches in lol. It felt good too. Well I suppose that's all for now. Well actually I think I should get this off my chest as well. I'm sick of this whole Greg and Erin drama so right now I'm proclaiming that Greg, back the fuck off n grow the fuck up and, Erin, Start standing up for yourself god damnit! Stop lettin him control you. Seriously u gotta be strong or people like Greg will control you and step all over you. Ok I think that's it for now lol. Toodles.............:0p

I so don't mean to sound like an asshole but they jus shouldn't have been together. The begining was ok n all but shit went downhill. Most likely cuz Mikey moved in like after a week. Not a good move. But I wish em both luck but they shouldn't be together. And I guess Allan is pissed at Dan cuz dan gave Loryl a back rub. How stupid is that? Bottem line Allan's stupid and a crappy bf for her anyway. They should break up but that's all on them. Loryl deserves better. Well some other dumb shit is goin on but I don't feel like creating anymore drama so I'll jus leave that shit alone. That's all for now. Toodles....

My ma already suspects he's cheatin on her with the dumb cunt so I think when I do tell her it won't hurt her as badly. It didn't hurt me as bad as I thought it would n i think it's cuz I suspected shit. It still hurt a lot but not as much. Well wish me luck.

And on top of that my dad jus got a new job at a car dealership and I know we need that money and my mom will need the health insurance. So I'm fucked right now. It jus makes me wanna beat him into a vegetable that much more. I feel like this could all be a bad dream but it isn't. It isn't something I can jus wake up from and everything will be ok. Everything will be ok for me cuz I couldnot careless if my father is in my life or not cuz he's dead in my eyes. But I know it could be the end of my mom's life. It's not my fault that he did this to my family. It's not my mom's fault or my sister's either. It's his own dumb fuckin bitch-ass fault. He couldn't be a man and jus be a loyal father and husband. I am gonna grow up to be better then him. I know I already am but I will be 100x more then what I am now. I won't let this kill me. I won't let this stop me from doing what I want and now I see it as what I need to do with ym life. Because thei will be a day where I will tell my mom and sister. Hopefully we will have a steady income to live on at that time, but if not then it's jus another challenge for us. We've been through alot and all that shit I guess u can say prepared us for this. I know I am pissed at him but I'm not sad. I'm only sad to what it will do to my mother. That's the only reason I care at all. I don't care about my dad. I don't love him anymore. If he dies tomarrow it's jus another bitch dead...........

"event","Well I've found out that my dad is cheating on my mom with someone named Lois. I found this out when I was on the computer and I had the headphones on my head but no music playing and they were only half on and my dad got a phone call on his cell phone at like midnight. I couldn't hear exactly what they were talkin about mostly because I couldn't hear what she was saying obviously and my dad kept sayin ""Whay are u sayin that?"" and ""Why are u being so mean?"" So I listened closer and heard him say ""I wanna be with you as much as possible"" or something along those lines, and ""I'm sorry I upset you"". So when he finally got off the phone with the dumb slut I waited an hour and went upstairs and grabbed my dad's cell phone to see if I could find out who the person was he was talkin to and if their was any evidence of him cheating on my mother. Well I found out Lois called him so I then looked at some text messages and found nothing incriminating and went to his pictre gallery and found out my dad is one of the stupidest mother fuckers on the planet because he took pictures of himself and Lois ( at least I'm assuming it was Lois ) naked and sleeping together and whatnot. So my father is nothing but the scumbag I suspected he was. But now I don't know what to do. I know this will kill my mother but I have to tell her. I will make sure he gets kicked out one way or another but b4 I tell anyone in my family I'm gonna do some ivestigations and get more evidence that he is guilty of Adultery. Adultery is illegal and Liz and shawn suggested that we try to follow him tomarrow because I heard him tryin to make plans with her for tomarrow. Once I get more evidence or after a week goes by, whatever comes first, I will call the cops and have my dad arrested for Adultery. The reason I'm going to try and do that and am leaning towards that is cuz as much as I want to kill him right now, If I do kill him or beat the shit out of him I will goto jail and that will be more pain for my mother. Now I am going to have to be careful about hen I tell my mother and sister about this becaus eI think my mom will want to kill herself and I think my sister will probably attack my dad and/or Lois. So I have to try to be smart and careful unlike my bitch-ass father. Well wih me luck and pray that Everything goes well for me as much as it can considering the current events.

Probably cuz I'm alone alot lately but whatever lol. I FINALLY got a savings account so I can save up for a  car n insurance. I'm on the road to not bein such a loser lol. Umm....Ryan and I r going to try to start a band I guess. I dunno if it's gonna be jus me, him, and his rave equipment or if we r gonna have a full band or whatever but we r gonna try and aim for hardcore industrial I guess. Imma jus see if I like doin it first cuz I'm kinda skeptical on if I'll like it or not. Umm... I met this chick April at work, she's cool n likes me lol. We made out in the cooler a lil the other day. Nothin big tho jus a lil kissin. She's pretty cool but I don't think Imma pursue anything really. She's in college n lives on campus n I have no car blah blah blah and I dunno if I wanna even stress over a relationship right now. I jus wanna chill, relax, have fun, and get back to being me. That's all I'm concerned about at this point in time. I'm not gonna even try to stress anything like a relationship right now. I mean if she or some wants to fool around, maybe, but I highly doubt it. I mean I dunno, certain parts of me wants a relationship with someone still, but I don't see me n her doin anything like that at this point in time, and certain parts of me wants to jus have like some real good sex n have fun like that lol. I dunno what Imma do with all thiat shit but I ain't stressin over it. I've been realizing that people that I used to chill with a lot r pretty much like ""Eh I don't wanna chill with Eric"" jus cuz they call me or somethin like that and r like ""I'll call u when we can chill"" or ""I'll come get u"" on shit like that n never do. I dunno. I'm not really holding a grudge tho seeing as how even if they did try to actually chill I dunno if I could considering my new work schedule n whatnot. I've been reminissing a lot recently too. Jus like all the crews I used to have and how much I miss ALL of those people, or at least who most of them were. Like the old South Meriden Crew, Me, Nick, Cathlick, Collin, Heather and Eric Sayah, Mark, and Joe. That shit was fun as hell. Jus bein kida and doin kid stuff. Ridin bikes, squirt-gun fights, snowball fights, sneaking cigs, and jus having no clue what the real world was like. I miss that. The Tree Crew, Me, Bobby, Lee, Devon, Joe, Craig, Calvin, Matt, Beave, Fran, Amberle, Nichole, Shannon, Scott, Jessamaduh, Sheena, John Arthur, and I think that might have been it.....there was alot of people even tho not all of em got along. And that group was my high school friends with some leaving and some new people coming in like, Mysti, Amber even tho I hated her and still do, Jill, Allison, and Mike Smith. I miss that. The Wallyworld Crew, Me, Mikey, Matt Ballard, Jessamaduh, Ryanne, Mike Dasanti, Ian, Melissa, Brian, Geoff, Robe, Danielle, Tabitha, Erik, Amanda, Joe, and Emily. I miss that too. And then The Boo Koo Crew, Me, Mikey, Ryan, Shawn, Dan, Loryl, Allan, and Alex. I miss that a lot too. But I'm jus wondering what will be next. Who will I be chillin with 6 months from now? A year from now? I dunno but I hope that they r people that care and will be true friends no matter what. Not saying the people listed above in the crews rn't but ISome I don't talk to anymore, am friends with anymore, have or are fighting with, or we jus don't see each other. But I do apprieciate their friendships and the expieriences, good or bad, for making me who I am. Right now is jus a resting period I guess I can say. But I think I'll be back to my old self once again, and maybe with a new crew by my side........That's all for now.

""I am the everything the all knowing
The omnipotent one
I watch the fields I do not feel
I circumnavigate everyone
I am the scarecrow, alone and disconnected
You stare right past me undetected
I am only here when you expect it
And feel a sadness undescribable
I hang emotionless holding a bible
No revival
I died and became apathy
Then married vacancy
Then moved my children to the tundra of complacency
I do not exist in your world
I've burned the bridges, I've cut the life line
Now all I have left is my mind
Which judges all of you
Analyzes your dumb philosophies
Inwonderment of how you all have ruined your ecology
But you do not hear for I am to you only but nothingness
And I can't understand why I'm the only one that feels like this
It's all piss, I flee
Out of all the people that have left me
The one I miss most, is me""

P.S. I miss all of you..........."

WELL NOW I HAVE TO PUT IT ALL IN A QUICK LITTLE NUTSHELL. Ashley i guess is giving up on me n her cuz i guess i can't see her that much. She is everything I'mm looking for in a girl but know I'm not good enough as usual. I would never give up on us because of the potential that we have. I care about her so much and i guess she doesn't feel the same and has found someone else. At least that's what i got from when i saw her tonight cuz she ignored me almost all night n kept talking to matt n shit. So that is upsetting me greatly and pissing me off cuz I've been paranoid about it for a lil while now. I will be depressed n shit for a while now but I WILL Be there for Mysti and Loryl cuz their ubcle jus died and they r hurting from that and I feel so bad for them and Coral and their Mom as well and I hope they can get through this. I am very lucky to have them as friends and I will be there for them whenever they need me. And that goes for all the other friends that have done the same for me, you know who u r. Well I hope that Ashley changes her mind and won't give up on me but I think that's jus a waste of energy wishing for that. Well wish me luck if u want.........bye.

If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin on square one
Tryin to pick myself up,
Where I started from..

[Obie]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like makes ???
Nothing could intervene us especially no hos
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, *****s they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

[Chorus]
{Girl singing}
Spend some time with me...
{Eminem}
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line..
{Girl singing}
Spend some time with me...

[Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
Till' you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my ***elry off
But it through me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's to hard to see
Till' you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That's haunting..

[Chorus]
{Girl singing}
Spend some time with me...
{Eminem}
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line..
{Girl singing}
Spend some time with me...

[Stat Quo]
(Yeah right bitch,
Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a ???
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole nother other shit
Tryin to play slick, thinkin I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss(?)
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? NOPE!

[50 Cent]
Em introduced us
50 this is Tonya, Tonya this is 50
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin, talkin like a oppourtunist too
Why talk when suckin my dick is the real carrer move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit..

[Chorus]
{Girl singing}
Spend some time with me...

I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line..

If I had a car I would have been in so many fights with pussies from a bunch of other towns who wanna talk shit. I so wanna get all this rage and angst out on someone. All this rage in my mind is burning a hole in my brain, and I think literally. In the last month I've been actin weird, I mean I'm always actin weird n crazy, but I've been gettin weirder and weirder by the day and been jus sayin some random ass crazy shit. I dunno y, but I jus am. Seems things r goin good for some people I know like Dan and Aly, and Loryl and Allan. Lucky bastards lol. Hopefully I will be happy with Ashley soon. I really like her alot. If their was a word in between like n love it would prolly be that lol. I think about her a lot. Especially since what happened to her, but she's says she's doin ok. I jus feel soooooooooooo bad that happened to her. She is such a sweet girl so I have no clue why that had to happen to her. Shit like that should happen to assholes who stab their ""best friend"" in the back. (I wonder who I'm talkin about...lol) Well I wish Allan and Loryl happiness because although I still have some feelings for Loryl and am a lil jealous, I still wna ther to be happy. And Allan is a good guy n freind so she's in good hands. And Loryl seems to really mean what she says about how she feels about Allan so I think he's in good hands too. I also wish Dan and Aly happiness. Another couple who r both very good friends. I jus fiind it funny that I went out with Aly back in the day, Then Shawn went out with her, and now Dan is, n the 3 of us chill a lot now. I jus find it a lil comical.I hope Shawn finds someone too tho. I mean he's been in shitty moods all the time so if he had a girl who made him happy in his life I think he'd be better. So it seems like almost everyone has someone that makes them happy, yay! lol well hopefully the rest of us will catch up soon.....Well that's all for now.....

I dunno I mean I've always thought that I really suck at it, but lately it's starting to sound better in my head but that really doesn't mean anything lol.....I can jus project a lot more now.

""And I can see her now 
Dancing around, her drink in hand 
All her baggage in tow 
I just want to forget and let go 
Of all the joy, all of the pain 
I took your guilt and placed it into me 
And now I kiss it goodbye 
Our last chance ended fatally 

Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight? 
Have you ever cried so hard? 
Baby you just died 

And there she goes again 
Another masquerade in false circumstance 
She'll fuck you just for the taste 
I just wish I could replace all the memories 
Of what makes my blood run cold 
And as your blood flows through me 
I say goodbye to what we had 

She came and went 
I gnawed through my lip 
Makeup smeared in her eyes 
Each sob's a reason to say goodbye. 

Sometimes when you're holding on 
You'll never see the light 
With flowers in her hair 
Gazed upon with dead lovers eyes 
She never looked so good 
And I never felt so right 
I felt so wrong""

"event","Well the show kicked ass. I wanted to knock this fruit ball out so bad tho. He kept pushin everyone so mad heads were fallin on me and hittin me in the head n shit so I was gettin pissed the fuck off. Mack 10 wasn't that bad. I got covered in Faygo. It was great. I even kept a bottle as a suvenire or however the fuck you spell it lol. Well I assume that Loryl is pissed at me cuz she didn't get to go but you know what? I don't really care right now. The only thing that would have made my night the best would be if I actually got some Jack Daniels n Coke. I wanted to get drunk so badly. Well November 2nd is the Twiztid show and I'm so fuckin goin to that. I realy wish I saw Ashley, (From Plainville) at the concert but I couldn't find her :(. Well I guess we'll chill sometime later. Hopefully, lol. I want a taco.....a pink one lol. I've been very very extra odd lately. I have no clue y. I'm thinkin it might be from stress or somethin. Oh yea, look on here within the next month for the 1st annual Eric's People Awards lol. I dunno either. lol. Ummmm what else happened today? Oh yea these 2 really hot lettes were crowd surfing and landed right on top of Pete n I. lol. Literally. It was cool. One of the lettes had on really really short spandex shorts on, it was a very nice sight lol. And then The first lette that landed on me, got up on Pete's shoulders and somehow her belt ripped in half so I now have an extra momento from the concert lol. I'm so thirsty right now. Wanna hear something weird? I have the feeling that I will have a gf in the next month. I dunno y or who it will be but I have that feeling. Hmmm..... what else? Imma go get a drink, brb..............................................................................................................................ok I got some water. lol. And yes I put brb in a live journal entry lol. Well hmmmmmm....anything else? Ummmm......I don't think so........ummmm Well I think I'm gonna go now.

"event","This is a plead to everyoe I know.................Never let me door tell me to do whatever I want......If I want something, like a girl, don't let me get into it. If you say I can read your private things that you've wrote, don't let me........I'm so fucking pissed off right now I don't know what to do. All I want to do right now n wish I could is get drunk. I wanna get completely wasted. And I want to scream and let all the rage in me out. I want to go n hunt down Lee Vernon and beat him into a coma. Jus because I have so much fuckin rage towards him. I want someone to tell me to ""Run my pockets"" so I can stab them in the face, pull out their eye balls, pour gasoiline into their skulls n throw my lit cigarette into the fumes. I want to fucking die. I want to live again. I want to beat the shit out of the people who have lied to me. I want to kill myself, figuratively, and become a huge fuckin asshole jusso I won't care about anyone or anything so I will never feel pain again. I want to jus completely demolish the lives of the ones who have made me go insane. It's spelled INSANE not ""INSAINE"" or however you fuckin spell it. I'm on a fuckin rampage right now. I have no compassion. No heart. No grasp of right and wrong. No feelings, but rage. All I see is bloodstains on my soul. I just want to leave this piece of shit life behind and start anew. I want to be someone else. I don't want to run though. I jus will have to deal with my insecurities, even tho I pretty much know I'm right about most of what I think. I will have to deal with the fact that almost nothing will go the way I plan or want it to. I have to deal with not having anyone special in my life. Someone to make me feel whole, someone that will make me feel complete. I had that once and nnow it's gone. And you know what Loryl? Fuck youo, you know god damn well what your fucking doin to me. I'm starting to think that you jus do what you do to me to watch me squirm. I think that you only want me around to give you attention whenever you want it. No more. Fuck it. I am not gonna give you as much attention and I'm going to try to make myself not care.......because everytime I do all I get is played with........What the fuck do you think you are doing? Stop being such a fuckin retard.............You want someone else....and then when you and I talk you start pullin the same shit with him in the next room none the less.....That's fucked up. Well I just hope he comes to his senses soon cuz he's jus in shit's creek. Or maybe you'll be there again. You know how much I fuckin care about you, and you know that I'm probably one of the few people in your life right now that cares what happens to you, and I probably care too much, how much I fuckin LOVE you, how much I would do for you just see you fuckin smile, and all I do is nice things for you and all I get is the brother treatment or you get pissed at me or jus treat me like shit, and after all the shit I do all you do is fuck with me...... When you come to your god damn senses and realize wrong form right, and stop pullin the dumb fuckin bullshit, then come talk to me......That's all I have left to say..............

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ff33>Sup? It's been a grip since I've updated do here's the scoop on what's been goin down. Well let's see.......first off, I'm divin into the dating scene again, tryin to find a gf once again lol. Hopefully this time things go a lil better lol. I still think of her a lot, but it's seems different now. I mean I still have feelings for her n what not, but they aren't as strong, but I know they could grow again if we tried it again lol. But as of now we are actually jus friends, n it's cool. I mean it's been seriously like alomst a year since we've been able to talk on the phone for mad long n jus bullshit with each other n bust on each other n know that we r kidding. It's cool. Ummmm I am interested in a couple of girls right now, who will remain nameless for now, lol. Ummm..........let's see what else?.......On Wednesday I'm goin to the Hell's Pit show. ICP, Ehsam, A.B.K., and Mack 10, I really don't care about Mack 10 at all lol but I'm dyin to see the rest of them&nbsp;again. November 2nd Twiztid is comin round again n I'm so goin to that. Blaze is tourin with them too so i finally get to see his show. Ummmm............Things have been ok with me, I mean I've been up n down a lot but I guess I'm cool. Hopefully I'll get the whole license n car thing situated so I can chill with a bunch of people I've been meaning to like, Ashley from Plainville n a couple other chicks. N it would be cool to chill alone with Loryl, Mysti, or Mikey n do somethin with them cuz I haven't chilled with either of them alone n did somethin in mad long. Not that I'm sick of chillin as a group but I jus think it would be cool to do. Pete and I are starting to be friends again. He says he understands y I was so pissed n stuff so it's cool for now. Craig on the other hand is pissed at me I guess but won't say shit to me about it. He only calls me up when he wants his hair cut or some shit. Whatever. I don't really give a shit. I'll jus be like ""Yea I'll call u"" n never call him like he does to me lol. Work has been goin ok I guess. I jus wish that they could give me some more hours or give me a raise or somethin. And this kid Kevin at work gets on my nerves so fuckin bad I swear I'm bout to break a coffee pot over that fruit ball's head. Wanna hear somethin mad odd? lol. All these chicks r sayin I'm hot n sexy n stuff, n I'm sorry but I don't see it lol. But whatever it's raisin my self-esteem n shit. Well I guess that's all for now. Hopefully 'll update a lil more often soon lol.</FONT></STRONG></P>

"event","Well let's see........Loryl is goin through a rough time cuz she likes someone who i'm pretty sure won't go for her. I told her that she could and will always be able to talk to me about anything but she still refrains from talking to me.....I odn't know hy. I mean I know that when I'm at work she's chillin n by the time I get home she's sleeping, or talking to Shawn. She can call me b4 I go to work and she can e-mail me, but she still doesn't. She says she wants someone to be there for her n try to help n stuff n I'm trying but I can't make her come to me. I dunno I still care about her a great deal but I'm slowy coming to terms that we will never be in an intimate relationship. N that sux a lot but I can't have it. But I am trying to move on n find n meet new people, but the urge to be with her still lingers.....a lot. Well I guess it will go away or I'll be able to bottle it up or something. It's jus so hard to see her, or even a picture of her n not want her in my life like I want. But hopefully we'll still be friends. It's all up to her. I've tried countless numbers of times to ask her what's wrong n she got on my case for it n said it was annoying n stuff like that. But now she wants that. I dunno she's confusing, always has been. Well all I can do is tell her the deal n it's all on her to come to me to talk, n up to her to make sure we chill. At least for now. I mean I dunno. I always feel like she doesn't want me around for like the past 2 months. Even tho she says she does sometimes, I jus still get that vibe. But oh well, hopefully she'll come around. I guess people think I'm changing. I dunno y. I mean jus cuz I've gotten drun 3 times in 2 or 3 weeks, I guess that means I'm changing or something. I dunno but someone explain how I'm acting or being different. It's confusing as well. I don't think I've changed much. the only thing that has is I like to get drunk now. That's it. I jus think that I'm being me n people are getting something different cuz I'm not around as much. I dunno. I'm tryin to look for a girl right now. But for some reason all the girls I meet that like me live far away. It kinda sux ass. But once I get a car n shit I'm gonna be chillin with em or something. I jus hope I find someone that will make me feel good n I will make them feel the same. And I hope I like them n they like me, n that turns to love from both of us. I dunno, sometimes I think I'll find someone n whatnot, but other times I jus think I'll end up alone or get hurt all the time. I'm mixed up. I am happy, yet sad. havin fun, but bored. Pissed but laughin. I dunno it's weird. Well that's all for now I guess. I'll update later......

"event","Well.........the past week has pretty much sucked ass......I'm completely done with Loryl. She doesn't want me........I guess. Fuck it i'm done with it. It jus brings me too much fucking pain. The one thing that hurts a lot still is after all i've givin, shared, and done for her, she still wants someone else n that kills me. I'm not good enough. Well if she wants to be friends then fine, but anything other then that will not happen. Even if I want it it won't jus cuz I want it. Whatever I want I don't get. Whatever. The only thing that was an escape this past week was work, and ghost hunting. Yea, that's right I said work. I guess when I'm workin i don't have time to think about my shitty life. Well whatever, I'll find someone. She's the stupid ass who missed out on love. Well actually she got love, i didn't. Well that's all for now I guess i'm jus bein bored n pissy now.

Then we went to bed and woke up and she got ready for work and Shawn brought her to work n then Sahwn n I went to get Katlin Burns and we went and picked up Loryl and dropped her off n went to the mall. Shawn bought a big ass sword and I bought the new ICP album, Hell's Pit because it finally actually came the fuck out lol. It's pretty good but some songs will take some time to decide if I like em or not. Anyways, after the mall we dropped off Kate and went to Loryl's. We decided not to go in the house because her mom was blowin up n we were like ""Ummmmmm let's drive around for a lil bit first"" lol then as we were pulling away her mom looked outside n either yelled at us or someone else so we were like ""let's jus not go"" lol. So we came to my house n chilled n Mikey came over n me n him practiced for a lil while, then Ben came by n me n him practiced. Mysti came by too. After we practiced we went to Wal-Mart so shawn could get some stuff or something lol. When we got back we were all gonna go to Big R's but I wanted to talk to Mysti for a lil while cuz we haven't really talked in mad long. So Mikey got all pissy n was like ""Whatever"". He's gotta stop gettin mad at dumb shit. It's a waste of energy. Hopefully today I get to chill n have some fun n hopefully chill with a certain someone lol you know who u r, you wanted me to write so god damn badly!!! lol :0D. Well that's all for now.

Loryl and I are now talking about my feelings and the whole me and Lee thing. She thinks she made Lee and I stop being friends. That's not the case. Lee had his chance to redeem himself to me by telling me everything that happened between Loryl and him, but he didn't. That's y I'm not his friend anymore. She is acting kinda strange, can't really put my finger on it tho. She wants Lee and I to be friends again but I don't see that happeneing unless he saves my life or something lol. Anyways last night was kinda scary. Loryl outta nowhere was feeling very sick and I was very worried. I took care of her all night til she finally passed out around 530 am. Shawn brought me home and I fell asleep around 8 or something. I just hope Loryl starts to feel better soon, I know I don't wanna see her like that again. Well that's all for now I guess.

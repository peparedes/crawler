"event","Its close to dawn  now and time to head home. Need sleep and out early, cant fuck up the biggest job I've had in months. This is the interview, the trial, if I shake hands with that fox Domino, I'm dead if I screw up. Havent been more than a few miles outta the city in a while, I wonder what types of monsters are roaming out there these days. I'll bring the babies and the spikes, wear the blades on the way out there so the messenger knows who I am. Its almost like pinning a rose to my blouse... hehe too bad black leather doesnt like pins. The old black leather halter and pants will work just fine for this job, they've already seen enough blood to break em in. What am I forgetting? The bike won't come out till tomorrow when I get it fueled at Dominoes. I should pack along a few snacks, I'm bound to get a good work out and get hungry.

Ah well, can figure out the rest when I get home. I am hearing the damn scrabble of their claws below this roof so its time to go.

"event","It's times like these I wish I still had strings for the old violin daddy left me. For that matter, horse hair for the bow would be a blessing too. Mine's not long enough to provide this, and mama says hers is the only beauty she can still claim so thats out. Perhaps its time to visit the meat farm and ask for what I need. Watching the Inferno's glow and parts of the city burn are the moments a good, tragic, Ode to Death is in order. Ah well, such is life in these times of without. 

Good greif, reading that paragraph, you'd thing I was getting soft and mushy. Nows not the time for it! Come on Fea, get yourself together! The big gig is tomorrow, gonna meet the caravan SE of the command center on the outskirts. That would be over that way. Hm, probably should get to a higher view point and directly locate it with the specs the boss gave me as a gift. Gods I wish I had the cash this Domino does! He's even got fuel for the bike so I don't have to hoof it with all my gear. Something tells me its not all legit buisness with him, but the pay is worth it... I think... In any case its a good thing I kept Kazi maintained while she sat in the basement.

Alright, game plan: get higher view so I can at least set out a route. Work off the last of the stress on the way home. Oops, been discovered here, got to move on..."

"event","Had an extra hour before my big meeting is scheduled, so I'll get rid of some of these jitters before I go. Nothing beats a good work out than writing to cure jitters. 

This one's gonna be big, I won't need to work for another month or more if this gets goes well. He went through all the hoops I set up to avoid military interferience, so this Domino guy must be pretty desperate. I'm almost positive he's asking me to do more than kick a few thug asses or deal with a bothersome horde. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself.  Here I was hoping that someone would help me revive the old ""Big Job Fea"" and now the oppertunity comes. Why the hell does part of my brain scream to run and hide? Can't say for sure, but its probably just that dread of getting back in the saddle after a fall...

Damn, forgot to brush my teeth I'm so jumpy. Calm down girl and get it together. And remember:

"event","Pardon my erratic posting. I've been quite busy preparing, and here we are, the prelude to Kurama's decadence. He'll be quite busy with me, until perhaps tomorrows dawn. And then we'll visit my garden. And I'll lay him at rest in the peace of his greenery.

Really, his death should be filmed. I'll look into it.

You must excuse me, I believe he's waking, and I have some new toys to try out.."

I finally caught you. Finally held you in my arms. Your screams fueling my passion...

Sometimes it feels like an empty victory, and so I beat you harder... Leave gashes along your sweet torso... Giving you my poisonous first aid...

I want you. And I have you. But the life is gone from your eyes. So I guess I don't.

I need to do something about this. His body bleeds... But I want to see his heart break. And so I need him to feel me. God. I'm taking on too many ningen qualities. I am going to kill Kurama within the week I hope, I just can't have him around to wear on me."

Reviewing this journal, I see where I started, and where I am.

Content bliss.

It doesn't appear as if the tantei have any interest in finding Kurama. Maybe I'll feed him? Keep my play a little longer? I would enjoy that. Indeed, it would be pleasurable.

Why even bother with these traps? *yawn*

Kurama has my love bites trailed across his skin. His face is untouched, as of yet. It's decadence shall be the fall of a millenia, I believe.

Duty calls. I must <font color=""blue"">(un)</font color>buckle <strike>up</strike> my pants and tend to my, ahem, chores."

"event","Kurama is fading fast. With the grace of an angel leaving this world... *sigh* I'm trying to get in all the fun I can before it's over. It's taking it's toll on him, for sure.

You know, I thought this would be much more exciting. I went through all the trouble of traos, and nothings happened yet... I did catch a lizard, but that's far below the company I was expecting.

Anyways, I should get back to him, I'm sure he's getting ancy... (by the way, I bought a spiral rack from the Makai Market.. :) Looks like fun.)"

"event","Kurama is getting thinner. I'd feed him something, but he looks so lovely when he's about to break. He is getting a little thin on top. I should stop cutting it so much, but, well. I can't help it.

It appears his friends are too pathetic to even leave. Of course, their no match for me, but seriously, they should have left by now.

Maybe they don't care about Kurama, ne?

It certainly would be suprising. So far their all just running around in circles. (chuckle) I suppose I happen to be expert at finding him.

Well, I'm not sure how much longer he can hold up. Maybe another month or so? I'll have to organize some festivities for the day. I mean, we can't see the death of an angel with out a farewell, now.

I must be off for some supplies... (wicked grin)"

"event","Pardon me for not updating. I have, until recently, been very busy.

Kurama was quite a fighter last night, but eventually, I think he managed to lay back and enjoy the ride.

Let me draw a picture for you.

Kurama was in chains, since I think they compliment him so well. His skin was bruised in a few places from my previous nights' foreplay, and his errection was, to say the least, exquisite. I swear, if I hadn't know better, I would have thought him a kitten rather then a youko.

He was wrapped in a bow of wards, like a present to me, and so I got out my scissors and cut some of the packaging. I cut a lock here, a lock there. Not too much. I want his hair to be beautiful at it's death, but I couldn't help it.

I got my knife out, it was an onyx blade, with slightly serrated edges. I lightly trailed it across his skin, making a small path of blood on his chest. His bloos is the same color as his hair.

I cleaned him up myself, and continued my passion. I asked him if he wanted me, and he dilegently replyed no. Of course, I knew he would say that, but I also knew his body begged for some release.

'Well, surely you'd have no objection to yourself, eh, Kurama?'

He began the process of touching himself, though I must say, he seemed quite reluctant. I enjoyed it though, and by the time he had, well.

I was ready to get him, and so I did. He was so sad, and that made my loving all the better. *sigh* Too bad I can't have him all the time."

"event","Kurama...

I was preparing him for my love, and he wouldn't talk to me.

It was so lovely. He was so pained...

His hair perfectly matches his eyes... I can't wait to see it in graceful wisps on the floor. His locks of hair falling to the ground. I'll wrap it in a ribbon the same color as his eyes...

And his body is so slim... I want to feel it writhing in my embrace. I want him to fight for it's sanctity. His pale skin should be lovingly kissed with bruises.

The beast is caged. My shackles lace his limbs, he's wrapped in my wards.

Does this mean he's mine? But how can I contain his lovlieness?

No. Surely it's spilling across the land as we speak? Of course the others will find him.

But first I will preserve him."

Kurama is in the corner, in shackles. Yet untasted, but I assure you, tonight, my love will be complete.

He is so lovely. And wild. Even with my wards, he radiates strength. I shall go make ready for the festivites. I'll tell you everything."

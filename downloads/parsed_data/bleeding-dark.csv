And second of all...I would like to thank Zach for one of the funnest and also pretty painful night.  The movie was funny. Your ass in my face was not.  Laying together was cool.  The wedgies were not.  Everything else was pretty good, except the vigina kicking, and the neck biting(you tease!!!! GRRR!!!)

overall, it was a good time. It felt like I'd spent forever there. Tomorrow I will probably wake up sore, and I bet my shirt will still smell of you.

I think the best part of the whole night was the backrub...or maybe it was the porn. haha."

1.  We don't talk much anymore.  You're always on in interent though, through your cell phone.  I never even get to see you much anymore either.  You give very good advice.  I wish we were better friends like we were before.

2.  We've been friends for a while.  On and Off you could say. I love our wednesday drives to your place when I take you home.  It's so much fun talking with you, and talking trash about others with you too! We have many memories together.

3.  I hang out with you sometimes.  You think I'm your bitch...whatever!  You kinda taught me how to play the drums...then that stupid cop came!

4.  We used to be closer a while back.  You came to the Grand Canyon with me.  We got lost...kinda. haha.  I remember one time at your house when you totally killed our pasta dinner and you had to make it again.

5.  We used to be friends in Elementry school.  I see you all time time at school, but I don't even think that you recognize me anymore.  I think we had World Studies together sophmore year.

6.  You drank my ranch sauce. asshole.

7.  We goto shows together and dance to the mean reds.  We always have a good time together and talk about people.  I'm jealous of how creative you are.

8.  We used to hang out.  You came with me to see Super Troopers when I went with Kevin because I didn't wanna go alone.  You came over to my house to meet my uncle.  We still say 'hi' to eachother.

9.  I just recently found out you have a journal.  You really never update and we really never talk.  You got me into listening to the Blood Brothers.

10.  I know your half-sister...we really don't talk.  We definately know who eachother are, and you talk with Rae a lot.

11.  You became my friend this year. You sit at the most awesome table and give all of us free shit.  You and Matt are always going at it.

12.  I think we talked once or twice last year.  Now were together in two classes. You help me get answers because your a waaay smart kid.

13.  We had a thing...it went away. You helped with a stupid 'joke'. you wrote a song/poem thing all about me.  I don't know what to do.

14.  Youre in my spanish class. Youre really smart.  You totally have a cocky attitude but youre still totally great.

15.  We just recently became friends about two weeks ago.  Youre really awesome and funny. I love talking to you over the net.  Your hugs are the greatest ever...even the one were you smashed me against the lockers.

16.  We just became friens.  You have cute glasses.  Youre boyfriend is in my psych class and we talk.

17.  You live in CA...I will IM you occasionally.  You have the most awesome hair and I love all the pictures you take.

18.  We hug everytime I see you...but thats not very often.  We were in a class together my freshman year, career pathways. We didn't know eachother then.

19.  We never talk anymore.  I saw you at edgefest twice, when you had those awesome lip piercings!

20.  You are sooo funny. I love love love hanging out with you.  I really love seeing you lay the smack down on some asshole kids at the movies.

21.  You got a LJ had one entry then never did anything with it.  You are a douche, but I still talk to you in Q's class.  You have awesome shoes."

If it makes you less sad, 
I will die by your hand. 
<b>I hope you find out what you want. 
I already know what I am.</b> 

And if it makes you less sad, 
we'll start talking again. 
And you can tell me how vile 
I already know that I am. 

I'll grow old 
and <b>start acting my age.</b> 
I'll be a brand new day 
in a life that you hate. 

A crown of gold. 
A heart that's harder than stone. 
And it hurts a whole lot, 
but <b>it's missed when it's gone.</b> 

<b><i><u>Call me a safe bet. 
I'm betting I'm not.</u></i></b> 
I'm glad that you can forgive. 
I'm only hoping as time goes, 
you can forget... 

If it makes you less sad, 
I'll move out of the state. 
<b>You can keep to yourself. 
I'll keep out of your way.</b> 

And if it makes you less sad, 
<b>I'll take your pictures all down.</b> 
Every picture you paint, 
I will paint myself out. 

<b>It's cold as a tomb, 
and <i><u>it's dark in your room, 
when I sneak to your bed</u></i></b> 
to pour salt in your wounds. 

So call it quits or get a grip. 
Say you wanted a solution. 
You just wanted to be missed. 

<b><i><u>Call me a safe bet. 
I'm betting I'm not.</u></i></b> 
I'm glad that you can forgive. 
I'm only hoping as time goes, 
you can forget... 

You are calm and reposed. 
Let your beauty unfold. 
Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones. 
Spring keeps you ever close. 
<b>You are second hand smoke.</b> 
You are so fragile and thin. 
<b>Standing trial for your sins.</b> 
Holding onto yourself the best you can. 
<b>You are the smell before rain. 
You are the blood in my veins.</b> 

<b><i><u>Call me a safe bet. 
I'm betting I'm not.</u></i></b> 
I'm glad that you can forgive. 
I'm only hoping as time goes, 
you can forget..."

"event","Ok so my mom and I went to go donate our blood today.  I did good, I filled up my whole bag with out feeling dizzy or anything. Yay.  Then came the little viles...half way through the 3rd one I got dizzy, so I told the guy then on the fourth I told him I was going to puke.  Low and behold seconds later I doing it in a trash can, but they were a bit slow getting it to my mouth so LUCKY ME I got some on my Vines shirt. My mom made fun of me. Good job mom.

I went home to change after I drank fluids and stuff. My dad thought it was funny too. Lovely. I changed then we went to Target, and Honey Baked Ham. 

On the way to HBH(honey baked ham) my mom and I saw a guy on the side of the road but we couldn't tell if he was breathing, so we made a U-turn and pulled into someone's driveway.  My mom got out and shook him a bit, no response, so she looked for a pulse he was breathing, so we called 911. Meanwhile two other cars stopped to see what was going on and if we needed help. One pair were a doctor and nurse. They tried to get a reponse from no, no luck.  Two police cars came and one ambulance.  They did there stuff and we left.

On the way back there were two ambulances and one cop car and they had gotten the guy to wake up.

Well that was my exciting day."

It fit perfectly, and you were completely right on saying that Erik is making it seem like it was OUR fault for believing words on a journal, and OUR fault for not doing everything that we could to find out if it was true or not.

<b>TO NICK AND ERIK</b>
Sorry to both of you but I'm afraid that I will never be able to forgive either of you.  I have already lost one friend in my life. RIP Brett. The news coming from a phone call telling me that Nick was dead stunned me.  Everything ran through my mind, everything that I went through with Brett, then I thought now I've lost another friend.  I'm only 17 this shouldn't be happening to me.  Later on to find out that this was a sick joke that both of you didn't think anyone would believe was like a slap in the face.  Knowing that I had lost one friend in my life to hearing from a crying friend over the phone that I'd lost another to ""sorry it was a joke"" was just all to much for me.  I am sorry it has to be this way, but that ""joke"" of yours was to much and went to far.  I hope both of you may someday realize how much pain and hurt you have caused, and I also hope that you both mature and realize that suicide/death is nothing to ever joke about."

well...I'm almost out of work, its 6:45ish, I was like what the hell, i'll just step on the scale and see if anything happened.........144......WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?

I'm wearing the same sweatshirt and the same shoes that I was during the first weighin! is it possible that I really lost like 9 pounds in the past 5 days!?!?!?!?!!  I'm gonna go have a heart attack now (even though I feel great!)"

"event","Holy crap today was awesome! I woke up nice and early, did my salt water flush cleaned for a bit...went to work. The usual happened, except I didn't really crave food all day....I mean I definitely thought about all the stuff i want to eat, but surprisingly all of it was healthy food.  I can't wait to have a salad on tuesday!

The only thing I HATE about this is the tongue thing....its kinda white now and doesn't feel all the great....its supposed to turn pink when your body is done detoxing....Kayla's turned on her 11th day....I unfortunately have to stop on day 7 (maybe 8 if I feel like pushing it).

My super sense of smell has gotten better! the book said that it would...for the firt time since I moved into my apartment last August, I was about to smell what the landlord had for dinner! weird!  and at work I could smell Tom's price chopper chicken from across the store and in the office!


I""m excited though, because today is now day 5 and I'm over the halfway hump, but I feel great!  It's all good timing too cuz I""m moving back home on saturday night and there are usually yummy things in the fridge.

I would really like a cup of nice hot coffee.....and yes, I am still dreaming about that bagel lol."

"event","ok, ouch! today was insanely difficult!  I had off from work today so this morning after the salt water flush, I packed up a bunch of stuff to bring to my mom's house.  What I didn't realize was how long it was going to be before I could make more juice! I ended up going almost 3 hours without getting any juice (only had a small bottle of water on the ride down) and it was killing me!!!  I made a glass when I got to my mom's house, unpacked the car, had a regular glass of water, then hit the road back to my apartment.  

During the ride I seriously considered quitting.  I was so hungry....hunger pains hungry!  I was thinking about just grabbing a salad or something and how it couldn't hurt but I held fast!  I got to my apartment and immediately made some juice and drank it down followed by a glass of water....it took about 20 minutes but my hunger subsided!  I feel so great for not quitting because I was sooooooo close!  It's already 6pm and ""m just looking forward to a couple hours when I drink my night tea and go to bed so then day 3 is over with.

HDTV is nice and distracting since today at Home Depot, my mom and I decided that we are going to make the second floor where my bedroom is a new project.....next week we will be installing hardwood floors by ourselves and painting our butts off!

whew...I'm really glad that I didn't cheat!"

"event","ugh.....today has been tough!  I woke up kinda hungry, but that passed as soon as I chugged the awful salt water....I definitely released some of the described toxins this morning! that was kinda cool....its a good start...

I have been slightly hungry all day.....everything has been smelling good...today was the day I figured I""d probably quit if it got real bad but its 10:15pm and I will not quit now! its too late.  As long as I keep drinking either the juice or just water any hungry feeling goes away.  

as the book says y day 3 you start to get that 'good' feeling, like you want the juice and that its just smooth sailing from here. I just miss the taste of food right now! lol

what has been on my brain all day is: a Mozzarella, tomato, basil panini with balsamic dressing......that is what I want."

"event","ok....well I didn't get to make an official start because I couldn't drink the tea last night before bed cuz I had to drive home from easton.  (Its Lax tea, you drink it every night before bed to encourage your body to expel the waste in your system.  Because I am not eating solid foods, your body needs help making deposits.) I didn't want the tea to kick in while I was driving back home! But I did drink most of the sea salt drink when i got home.  

I had a feeling it was gonna be bad....and it kinda was.  Every morning when I get up I have to drink 1 QUART (!!!) of water with two level teaspoons of sea salt (aids in the ability to make a deposit and works as in interior shower). I made it through almost all of it.  It was pretty gross...but I decided to not drink it with cold water tomorrow because its easier for me to chug warmer liquids then out of the fridge temp.

It's almost 4 now, I have had 2 16oz lasses of the lemon juice mixture and another 16oz glass of just water.  I know I'm not actually hungry but my head knows that something is up.  I think its just the need to chew my nutrition for the day and not drink it.  

Now, I have been at work all day so not casually eating anything hasn't bee a problem....however, I am going home a little early today and the hard part is going to be not casually making coffee or snacking on something.  Luckily, since I am moving back home in a week, I have packed almost all of my food making apparati and any food still left in the house.  Out of sight, out of mind.  

Still, day one is usually pretty easy when starting a diet or doing a cleanse....its two, three, and seven that are supposed to be hard.


p.s. I'm stuck stopping on day 7 anyway because March 3rd is my brothers birthday and we go to Floods every year....well its an every year tradition that we started last year when he turned 21.  It would be a bummer for the two of us to be there and he's the only one eating and drinking....so I'll have to take a break and pick it back up after St. Patricks day."

"event","Ok, here's the scoop....since I arrived in wonderful Matamoras a little over two years ago I gained 20 fucking pounds.  What makes me crazy angry is that i didn't notice until LAST JUNE!!!! How does this happen one might ask?
1. There is NO good gym up here, I went from going to the gym everyday to not really going at all.
2. Cuz it sucks so bad up here the only thing to do is drink.
3. Cuz I've lived with dudes my whole time up here I ate crapy foods more often than I should.

Ok, the reasons are out of the way....what further upsets me is that last September I joined Curves...the closest non-disgusting gym-type place within 30 minutes.  I go about 4 times a week.  Even a little bit of working out is better than not working out at all right?? I have removed a lot of the garbage from my already Vegererian diet and end up gaining weight.....yeah yeah the old saying ""muscle weighs more than fat"" bullshit....but really a pound is a pound wether its fat or muscle.

Now, my BFF and I tried a ghetto version of the Master Cleanse back in the Shawnee days but we just failed miserably.  Well turns out she went and got the book, and followed the rigorous steps that you need to take for this 10-15 day cleanse and she lost 12 pounds on top of what she had started losing.  So Fuck it, my book should arrive any day now and I'm starting on Monday. Good news is that since I am moving back to my moms I can go back to the ESU gym and work my butt back off.

As extra motivation I'm going to post before and after pics for the Cleanse....gross and embarrassing for me, but I'm going to do it anyway.    I wanted to start the Cleanse the day after getting the book but my Bro and I are going to see Kevin Smith on saturday night and with comedy comes beers! so I'm pushing it to Monday.....

I have stocked up on my workout videos so I have something to do in my now empty apartment.  I'm completely adamant about this now because I put on a couple shirts that I hadn't worn since my 130lbs days and adding an extra 20 to shirts that used to look awesome just made me depressed!! It was bad news bears.

MOST OF MY CLOTHES ARE FROM THE OLD WEIGHT DAYS!!!!!! thank goodness for Phantom T-shirts.....


Hopefully I will be blogging this process everyday starting today.  Pictures will be taken the day I start the Cleanse.

For some reason this angered me immensely.  Are people still that stark crazy about saving 2 dollars that they have no decency for people???  I mean c'mon we know that Wal-Mart is still gonna have that 3 pack of lavender body sprays tomorrow.  Who stampedes now-a-days anyway?

If I wasn't so angry about this dude dying from it (and others getting hurt....including an 8 month pregnant woman [side note: thats her own fault for waddling herself out of bed at that hour and that pregnant....no sympathy there]) that I could barely find the humor in this quote: ""Some man lost his life because a VCR was on sale?"" (who uses a VCR and I think if one was on sale it would be like 10 bucks, not worth stampeding soe poor employee who hates life cuz he has to open a wal-mart at 5 am."

On the last flight I finished my book :( but it was crazy good: The Heroin Diaries: a year in the life of a shattered rock star by Nikki Sixx.  I learned a couple things:

1) I'm in love with Nikki Sixx
2) I'm going to download every piece of music he has ever been associated with
3) I will NEVER ever do Heroin....especially if I become a rock star
4) however; it makes me want blow really badly (or should I say Krell?)

When I met Heroin, it was true love.""

Well, I failed to recieve the memo that states:  If you decide to take a plane trip within a week or so of your 'monthly visitor' then the pressure from a flight will enduce an early visitation.......................

So much for not having to worry about anything but partying.

Its so ungodly humid in Key West! Sarah and I got there (after a 7 hour car ride) at 12:30 PM and i instantly started sweating.....and that kept up till we went to sleep at 5!!!  How can it be possible to sweat your skin off when the sun isn't even out.  

Reguardless of the uncomfortableness I really did have a good time.  Ferrets rock, but they smell kinda bad.....which leads up to my 'right now'

I was supposed to catch a flight back home this morning at 6:45 so I can connect in Charlotte by 10: and be home during my moms lunch break so she can pick me up at Allentown.

Well....I get to the airport at 6:10, i'm standing in line to check-in and this dude comes by  says anyone taking these flights (listed a couple and then mine): has to go into this realy long flight and get another one cuz you're late!

Needless to say I waited in 'stand-by' for the only flight that would have gotten me to Charlotte in to connect flights....no dice.....now i'm not expecting to get to Allentown 'till 4:30....and thats only if I make the stand-by cut for the upcoming flight........."

As of September 8th I weigh a sad 145 pounds (only 12 up from last summer), I am posting that because I have a weigh-in every month and I would like you guys to know my progress.....and by posting it and trying not to be embarrassed it will encourage me to lose the poundage.

I have decided that the wii is the last remaining piece of my working out that is going to help me kill the 20 pounds that I gained since last summer.  See, these pounds would NEVER have tacked on if there was a decent gym in a 20 mile radius of my apartment.....but there isn't, so a Wii it is.  

I'm already slightly obsessed with Wii tennis and my right arm is a little achy.  But I'm comtemplating posting my current weight and just hoping for positive ""go-you"" feedback from the few people who can read my posts.  Since I don;t have a scale nearby i'm not going to present you with the ghastly number right now.  maybe tomorrow when I'm at work.  But if anyone has access to a wii fit and would like me to buy it from them or knows anywhere that would have it and put it on reserve til I can come pick it up, that would be spectacular.

A little piece of joy that has happened recently:
1) I moved into a new apartment!  Rock the eff on.  
2) This place is bigger and better.  
3)The landlord doesn't have an asshole significant other that wants to raise our rent to an inappropriate amount.
4) WE CONTOL OUR OWN INTERNET!!!

ok so that last number is not so exciting, but it is when your old landlord is pissed that you are moving out so he decides to be childish and turn the internet off any time he's not using it.  Especially since warcraft controls my life, being off work without the internet makes me want to kill someone IRL.

We were both hungry and if we got there early enough for food they wouldn't charge us covour when the band starts.  So we made the decision to go and try to gather theatre people!  We started with some phone calls and since we dind't have Arial's number yet we decided: heck lets go peruse his dorm and find him!  Well as we found out last year, Arial has this uncanny ability to be found whenever we are looking for him.  No seener then we got out of Kriss' car did we here 'YOOOOOOOOOOOO' from the third floor of Hemlock Hall!  Crazy Arial and his magical tracking device!

So the three of us travelled over to Lenape to go visit Sherman and then we were were off to Kriss' place to have an 'attitude adjustment'.  After that we went to  Sarah street where a good time was held by all.  I played the most wicked 7 games of pool of my life!  After bombing out my half of the team (even though we still won) at that first game, I was unstoppable, I was making rail shot, 3 ball combos...hell I even correctly called my missed when I had no shot and just had to hit something.  We were clearing folks off the table left and right!  The best mini-convo that took place happened with me and Ryan Groff (yes the naked dude) it went as follows:

Ryan: I still don't believe that you are Puerto Rican
Me: Just cuz I'm not a card carrying member???
Ryan: No its cuz you aren't a card carrying member(says these words while circling his face indicating my whiteness) 
Me: Dude you saw my mom, thats proof right there!
Ryan: when did I see your mom?
Me: um...remember that rockin' cast party at my house, and my parents were there???
Ryan: Oh yeah...I thought that was the maid!

Holy shit did I laugh my ass off about that for the rest of the night! Ryan was upset that absolutly noone heard that gem but myself.  So of corse we told the story over and over.  Anyway, ended up staying out wayyyy to late on my first school night of the semester and woke up to super stress, that if I was to talk about in this journal I might get slapped for it being so long.  So you will get it tomorrow."

"event","yeah so I know I haven't said anythign meaningful and interesting on here in a few days so I figured I'd scratch my brain a little bit and see what I can find to indulge you guys with.  Um....yeah I can't wait for school to start in less than 3 weeks!!!  And not just because of theatre and not just because I'm supposed to be graduating this year but I really do like going to school.  So fun.  

Wing night semi-sucked last night because noone came out so we stayed for a couple beers and some wings and then peaced-out but the coolest thing happened on the way to the wings (lol).

I got to Kriss' place and Billy was rushing out because he said that 'the bike was found and had to leave immediately' so we were like um...ok.  So we gathered money and such and started walking to Floods.  On our way there just past the Irish Pub this girl Lisa goes running by, stops and says hi and keeps running, and we were like, poeple are weird today!  So we get to just about Front Row and there is a group of our peeps gathered around a bicycle.  Julian was like we found Jakes bike (which Kate is using, which was apparently stolen about a week ago from their apartment along with a lap top) Kate wa slike I think the guy is in te cigarette store, I was like just steal your stolen bike.  So some of the girls go into the cigarette place and yell for the 'owner' of the bike outside.  To all of our dismays a black dude walked out.  (our inner voices all went 'goddamnit' How freaking classic)  So the guys comes out and Kate's like you stole my bike and he was lik I stole nothin'  so we asked him where he got the bike and he totally skirted around answering the question and he kept telling people to 'give him his three feet' which made me laugh my ass off every time.  This dude was freaking out and noone was saying a word to him.  Billy got in his face but backed down to soon, and Kate called the 'po-po'. 

So of corse because the two of us are standing there minding our own business the black dude started bitching to Kriss not thinking that we were on Billy's side and then he found out that we weren't siding with him and he freaked out even more.  BD (black dude) was like oh I see now you are going to open your mouth cuz you got your girl here or something and Kriss said 'first of all you got your three feet (which made me laugh my ass off so hard that I had to walk away) and then he said well my girl is Puerto Rican and she doesn't need noone to act cool around her she can mouth off if feels the need"" so BD said I dont care if she's fucking Japanese whats that got to do with anything?   So thats when I opened my mouth and said ""At least we Puerto Ricans would know where we stole the bike from and would proudly say so instead of denying it!""  That set him off again and I just laughed and Kriss was like lets get wings. (this was after the BD for some reason called me Kriss' superman so now I'm officially the Puerto rican Superman! ...yes thats right I said superman not superwoman.) 

So we sat in Floods and laughed about that story for a good couple hours, then went back to Billy's and discussed the situation with Billy and Julian and Kate (she did get her bike back).

I kept telling Julian to give me my three feet, and he couldn't get over how classic it was that a black guy was stealing a bike.

I guess that made for a good livejournal story."

Well I found out from my buddy Asian_john that there was a rift in the theatre department at school yesterday.  As those of you know we couldn't do the Metamorphoses revival at the begining of the year for the freshman as planned because of budget issues or whatever.  Well after I had found that out I was sad but what can you do right?  And then after I found out that Susan was going to direct the Laramie project I wa spissed again because that show blows so bad, and I figured that since the children's show script sucks that my final year of theatre was going to suck.  

Well what made it worse was that I just found out that the dean decided to hire the acting group from Bloomsberg university to put on the Laramie project for the incoming seniors!!!!!!!!!!!  What the fuck!!!!!  I'm so pissed that we were concerned about the budget and felt it better to not do Metamorphoses again and he goes and spends extra money!!  So angry, I don't know if the hired troop is still on, but I do know that Susan is now not doing the Laramie project which makes me very happy.  I couldn't believe it when I heard that."

You see, I was speaking to the lovely miss saratravolta the other morning and I was casually talking about my upcoming camping trip...yes I said the word camping again....and yes I'm sober in all aspects of the word.  Well not only is it camping, oh no, there is so much more.  Turns out that Newbie and friends go to this Latvian volleyball tournament thing every year.  There are 'pro' teams and kids teams and drunk teams (yes thats the one we are going for).  This place just so happens to be in Michigan.  We will be leaving wednesday night and returning monday sometime.  Also, upon expressing my interest in possibly going I recieved a hearty answer of: ""Good cuz we kinda signed you up to be our alternate.""  ....yeah.  So anyway, I was telling all of this to Sara and she promptly told me that I have very little chance of making it out of Michigan alive.  Mostly because I was told by the camping king that this would be 'dirty' camping.  yay for me.  

So we thought it would be funny if my last journal entry before my excursion would be a farewell letter which will include my will.  I am telling you this now because those of you that I forget to put in my will I wish for them not to be upset with me.  I merely forgot because my brain seems to be awful clouded these days....I swear its the blonde dye....So yeah let me know which of my belongings you have interest in because it will make my will writing a lot shorter if I just know what people want instead of making it a grab bag....of a free-for-all...wait scratch that idea because I don't want any assassination attempts just so you can raid my stuff!

Yeah so, as Part of the newly created Ultragalactic super friendship alliance club (or the U.S.F.A.) as us indiders call it...I'm able to stay in touch with some of my cool friends down in quakertown!

That and its creator, my friend Nick, is CRAZY!  but we let that slide you know.

Well for those of you who have not found out yet we aren't doing Metamorphoses again!  What is totally dick is that Susan hasn't called any of us to tell us this little piece of info!  I found out from Jason who was in the show who got a call frim Brian Sickels (our TD) that he's taking down the set next week or so and that he will need help!  I was like say whaaaaat!?  Yeah so the few of us whom I have spoken to are rather upset about this situation....especially with Susan.  Oh well.  I'm going to miss it so freaking much!  theatre this year is going to such so bad...as far as shows go so far, the only hope is that the one-acts rock (as they usually do) an dthat this 4 person fall show goes off well.

So yeah it was Poptart Monkeys day yesterday.  I haven't seen those boys since last time they were in Shakers about a month ago.  And PTM shows are always a damn good time!  Especially since its typically a girls-nite sort of deal.  Once again we danced on the stage, had strange boys buy us drinks all night and try to get in our pants but we were like dude girls night back off! lol, it was crazy.  James (the sweet bass player) went in search of pink guitar picks for me and jen on his break cuz I was like 'I have to get a pick before I go cuz I have one for everytime I've seen' (which is 7) and he was like which colours you got? and I said only black and white, and he said that will not do, and he went off in search of different ones.  

'Spoonman' was there and he was shakin it up big time.  He's a dancin fiend!  He forgot his spoons though and the bar dude couldn't find any so we didn't get to see a spoonplayer in the band.  oh well.  Crazy man that spoonman. 

Ok enough of this entry.  Its going to be one hell of a long day!

"event","I have decided to take a little book break from the wonderful world of Harry Potter to rest my eyes a bit and write a journal entry.  Like many other crazy people out there I was at the mall at 9:15 since Walden opened early to get my copy of the new HP book.  So I've been reading that most of the day.

Nothing else has really happened since the last entry, My step dad is still in the same state that he wa sthough the Doc's say that he is taking baby-steps in the right direction.  Johnny (my bro) said that he opened his eyes the other day for a few seconds.  But he hasn't since.  

Well anywho, time to get a sandwich and go back to reading.  talk to y'all later!"

"event","hey out there in soberland....how is it out there?  I might be back soon. lol.  Anywho, yeah so a bunch of us went out after work last night (including the bosses) and they got us all mad tooted!!!!  It was crazy.  I scored mad points from my car bomb chugging cuz I beat out Irish boss by a landslide!  Yum...Car Bomb to the belly.  I definitly was not planning on staying late cuz I was supposed to get home and fix the internet and take a shower and all that fun stuff, and I ended up leaving there at 2am and not making it home.  Thank goodness for friends close by with places for me to crash, because there would have been NO WAY that I was going to make it home.  

Holy crap, I have severe ciggarette voice today and I feel like crap! lol, not hungover of corse because I'm better than that, but just feeling crappy cuz I'm stuck at work and I need a shower. 8 hours and 15 minutes before I get to go home and do that.

yesssss I just found out that me and the ladies from work are going to get thai food for lunch...that just made my life happy.  so yeah, I think I'm going to go make the copies that I have to do and change my pants....cuz I'm still wearing the ones from last night (gross)."

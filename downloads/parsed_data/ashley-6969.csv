"event","Got out of bed at noon since I don't go to school(I am kicked out of school).  Then I went back to bed.  Then I got up at 6 PM, and took a shower.  Went to Ritter's, making myself fatter, went home and watched Radio, about the retard...made me think of Ruth-Ann.  Then Rella called and went to hang out at the great, amazing, coolest fucking place in Shelbyville, the fucking pool hall.  Now I'm at Rella's house, getting a live journal, getting in the in crowd now.  FUCK OFF!"

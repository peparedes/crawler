Got 2 day suspenchion

There, rel short version. anyway i'm gonna say my stance on the war... u relly think i man that war?

i guess the war is all aganst spending 2 mush time with andy... cours it lasted about 2 days. so heres my standing on dis whole thing.

   I guess its no big deal that the nick and andy got g/f's dosnt change NEAt at all, will come up in convo... sept when they r around, take the fair 4 example, andy suddley became 2 cool 2 evn be in the fair, or even enter the kid section, kinda like dis here NET     JA, it messes everything up. probly the same4 shelby and nick, but NAT is never around when dat happens... thank got, shelby is ugly.

  Toast partys rul, if only we didnt hate jessica that much she wouldnt have 2 get so pissed about, w/e

anyway, luck is w/ me i only had 2 see shelby 2times, and jessica once... as for the others, their not in NEAT they r just there.

YEAH, b4 i 4get, wuzzup w/ trob right now? 1 girl from school likes him... hes not trying 2 keep away! i would have said i hate u right off the bat. guess that was torth noting."

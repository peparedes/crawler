"event","Well well, its 2007! wonder if this year is going to be any different, but from the last 23 days im not holding my breath. Hmmmm my birthday next week the big 20 . . quater of my lifespan gone and what have i got to show for it, nothing! Examinations are in full flow too how wonderfull lucky for me the one i'll be doing for a long time is on Thursday, then again i havent a clue what to expect for the exam so im crapping myself, if you have any information regarding how to pass the introduction to B/A Film Studies module MS - 103 i'de be happy to hear from you. Hmm Augusty was the last time i filled this in. Just to inform all my lovely veiwers that I now live in Swansea on the bottom floor of a very cold flat surrounded by people who claim to be friends but constant wispering has led me to believe otherwise in recent weeks. At the moment i think university is turning into a scene from that film loser ( the one with the Wheatus soundtrack ) except he gets a stunnin girl outta the whole equation . . . hmm guess it aint like tha film after all. Well from now on i think i'll start filling in me journal more often. A daily dose of writing should keep me occupied. Events of today include gettin up, driving peps to train station sleping more, cooking food, watching films n onto writing ooooooooooooooo exciting life i lead."

"event","Well well i didnt think i still had this. Im feeling in a creative mood right now, i have just got home from an extremely shit night out and that is why i am on the computer this late. All night i have been getting mood swings but looking back never happy ones :( think i should give up and become a constant depressive ( yes i sound emo, if u have problem kiss my big fat ass). Checking this account out a second ago realised i have not filled anything out since january! its is now late august :s. In that time i have managed to pass my driving test and pass my A levels so i am being shipped off to university away from this hell hole. But as usual there is going 2 be reminders thanks to other ppl going from here n wanting to bug me in my time of relaxtion ( in some aspects anyway ) I really want to get away from it all but i will discover that privilge for as long as i live i reckon. And thanks to tonight of going out to town i feel as though my self esteem has taken a new form of low of the phase but bluntly by a passer by "" uhh ur short aint u, nothing much going for you then"" that was taken to heart, not much ever gets taken to heart by me and that did which basically fucked up my entire night overall congrats to the stupid women in the meze lounge saying that to my face. So right now though to everyone gettin into university and having what looks a happy family aint much believe me, whatever anyone says if u dnt feel good about yourself then ur neva gunna be happy so 4 once im being selfish n going on about me it may sound mean but for once i want too. At the mo, im drowing my sorrows in a bottle of magners chocolate brownies if i was watching sex in the city n had ice cream ide feel gay as well but thats a step too far. . .. yet resorting to being gay may become more handy as women are tending to piss me off currently with well . . everything full stop!!"

It's a kiss without love 
It's the faith that we're losin and the truth that we hide 
It's a tear without cryin 
It's a word with no sound 
It's my heart full of sorrow and a lover left behind 

Keep me from fallin from fallin...(you gotta set me free) 
Keep me from cryin from cryin... (and now its clear to see) 
I'm leavin i'm leavin...(that it's time to let me be) 

Let it slide let it slide 
I know it hurts when i say goodbye 
But the time has come, let me spread my wings 
It's time to let me fly 
Let it slide let it slide 
I know it hurts when i say goodbye ...but the time has come 
Let me spread my wings...it's time to let me fly 

It's a room full of silence 
It's a day without light 
Well anger keeps risin, and theres nothing left to say 
Put your face at the window 
It's the world passing by 
And the life that we shared and the love that belonged 
Turned to pain along the way 

Keep me from fallin from fallin...(you gotta set me free) 
Keep me from cryin from cryin... (and now its clear to see) 
I'm leavin i'm leavin...(that it's time to let me be)

Yeah, yeah

Why are we overcome with fear? 
What if I told you that fear isn't real.
Why are we overcome with death? 
What if I told you my friends your doubt
You could live without!

There is a question I want to understand
Why can't everyone tell the truth and learn to love again

Do you know...what it feels like to be broken and used
Scared and confused
Yes I know

One more question...I know time is dear
Is what the world speaks of love really real?
The answers not of this world but very clear
Look above to find love and you found eternal life

Street corner preachers you've heard before
Friendly advice just gets thrown out the door
There is a question that I want to understand
Why can't everyone tell the truth...and learn to love again

WEDNESDAY night at adonis wasn't the best crowd out of the 3 that we have had so far but i know all of you who didn't come wednesday will be there this week (right?? please do)). I love putting the shows together for them!! 

THURSDAY at Yadda was one of the better shows i have had there. I am not sure if i will be there 2 much longer. I love the club and I have had the best year there ever but things are changing and people are changing. Most of all I am changing. I am not sure when or how soon or truly what will happen but if i put a webpoll on here and my 304 friend of my voted they would say they havn't been to yadda and don't plan to or they would say have been there and don't plan to ever go back. To those who say they love yadda,,,well so do I..but its becoming hard for me to get anyone to come anymore. for a while i thought i just lost it..i lost my touch...but after working at adonis, the dock, masque, i realize its not me..So...anyways lol. 

FRIDAY night i hosted the show at the Dock...I am not the SHOW DIRECTOR!!! I am working with the dock yes, I am all about Cincinnati!! And helping everyone and everplace the best i can! 
But i had a wonderful time... Everyone keep telling me the girls that where there and i was the breath of fresh air it needed!! So..go check it out,,theres nothing wrong with cincinnati supporting more then one club!! Although adonis is a breath if fresh air! 

SATURDAY (2night) I was at adonis ((i will be at adonis every wednesday and saturday performing and putting the shows together)). TONIGHT adonis was packed out the door. The show went pretty fast both times But penny Tration was so funny on the mic! Lady Jetta Gave us a show!!! and jenna jive was very pretty and entertaining. JAZZMEN dane looked HOT!!! as well (lol). 

Well thanks for listening to me Talk About my Week!! 

((i will be at adonis wednesday, thursday yadda, friday @ the dock, and Saturday AT ADONIS!)) see u soon!

I wish I could do all all over again,

I really love christmas you guys! I DO I DO..
its november 10th.. i feel like the past 10 days i have enjoyed the holiday season 2 times so far.. and that makes me very sad.. so its time to get my ass on track.

So tonight i watched my FAVORITE christmas movie of all time ""christmas vacation"" its was really nice watching it. i have seen that movie maybe 30 times in my life and still to this day i laugh and find my favorite parts funny.. i got 3 new xmas movies today at walmart. I love earl and matthew, i love my family...i really do. 
I feel like i have grown up so much this year. its crazy to say that but i really feel that way..its weird reading my journal from like a year ago. i was so weird lol. bitching about crystal and sam, randi and jennifer lol. talking about how much i dislike amber..how much i missed people and hated people, and blah blah blah. don;t get me wrong i still dislike people and i still miss people but its so different. mainly in the way i handel it. we all learn something everyday...
So lets talk about my day.. lets start with saying i really feel my lesson for 2day is to becareful who you trust and when it comes to people who have to always stay cautous and protect your self. thats is not directed to anyone thats just my lesson for the today. 
Well lets just sum this up in the fewest words as possible...well for the past month if have put as much as i could into helping amber..helping her find her way. I think it was because i was a victum of randi with her. so we could just move on together and just have fun and live. well last night at 4am i found myself questioning this whole things because i finaly talked to randi for the first time in forever. Lets just say amber told me something that she new that randi kept from me. and when she told me it was like taking aknife and stabbing me in the heart 12 times. so out of anger i told amber some of randi secrets. so until last night i believed that randi was still lying and playing games with not only amber but with me as well. so i talked to randi and she is now telling me everything amber is saying is just a lie because ambers goal was just to take me from her.. so truthful i am just walking away from this, i do not care who is telling the truth or who is lying. i just don't care.. i really don't. this is the battle and i am not playing apart.. my only part i am playing is just protecting myself and being a friend. so that was 100% the leass possible words i could put that.. so here i am November 10th and just loving christmas.. i am so excited about my thanksgiving dinner (sam u better come). i can not wait to i go to my familys yeeeh!!!.
I LOVE MUSIC...I AM LISTENING TO CHER AND ROSIE CHRISTMAS SONG RIGHT NOW SMILING....I LOVE IT.
SO THATS WAS MY DAY IN A NUTT SHELL..

I love it. I didn't put my tree up just yet but my house is so nice and warm and ready. I can not believe its going to be 2006 already. i feel like it was just 2001 lol. life is flying by and theres no way to slow it down. you can try to just not think about it and enjoy life but when u stop one day and look its like 7 years later. 
so last nights show at purgatory was awesome. sam and julie showed up and suprized me. that was the best suprize ever lol. 
well i just wanted to post a little something something.
You guys need to turn some xmas music on and get ready for the holidays. we have less the 60 days left of the holiday season. once its over you can never get that time back. it will just be a short memorie. so make it last. make it be the best ever.
I keep dreaming the same type if dream ever night. i am not sure why but in ever dream amber and jessica are a couple again. hmm.. that would be amazing. but who knows. i just don;t know why i keep dreaming it.
jessica is coming intown for thanksgiving which makes me excited. i can't wait to see her.

"event","Its Halloween Night.
My plans where to go tricker treating with matthew and earl but that didn't go as planed. So for the first time in 24 years I am home on Halloween.
I am pissed off right now because earl can sometimes be the biggest ASS hole in the world. Other times hes the most amazing man i have ever meet.
He is so high strong and against things I live for. ehhh.
Anyways...
So i had a really good weekend, Friday i went to the mall and stuff with jennifer. We talked things out and had a really good time. My feelings on me and jennifer is the older i get the more me and her become more and more alike and its hard for 2 people who are so much alike to not fight at some points. but it was nice.
Saturday sam and julie came over as well as amber. we went and seen SAW 2.. OMG it was so good. so scarey. after we drove around and yelled at people and laughed more then i think we ever have. it was awesome.
sunday sam and julie came over again as well as amber, wayne and his new boyfriend adam. we sat around and talked, it was fun. me and wayne was so stupid.
i think sasha is coming over 2night.. nt sure
ok well bye for now

"event","Well I just Made the best cd ever for my boyfriend to enjoy in the car.
Nothing to special just some really good songs that i like that i am sure he will enjoy.
So I had 5 shows last week. This week i just have 3 (yeeh).
But I had a meeting today at Purgatory and Wednesday i have to be at the dock at 9 to pratice for this production we are doing or something. So even of my off days I still work some how lol. But drag is fun, I love my Job.I love the career i choose.

So on a Deeper note. I feel like alot of things are crazy in my life but i am so busy i can't stop and fix the things i need to fix. I don't have time. So i kinda forget until moments like this and then i'm like wow.. what happen lol. I am fighting with jennifer for a week or so. i had like 10 mins they other day to chat about it and i ended up hanging up just because i don;t feel its nessasary to fight right now. Theres some many better things to do then fight over bullshit. I Posted a comment on her myspace in a comment box about my show at purgatory (as i do alot of people)..but it pissed her off. then i sent out a next message to everyone on my cell about Last Tuesdays show, and i cost her 10cent..or shall i say i waisted 10cent and treated her like a fan..I just don't understand jennifer sometimes. I just want me and her to be ok and live life and not get all weird. i have spent so much time being so wrapped up in my friends that it depressed the fuck out of me. i would get so sad and write in my journal about how fucked up my friendships are when truly i was just t wrapped up. I didn't do many shows at that point so i guess i was jsut bored and made things bigger then what they was lol..but now i have grown and being wrapped up in fights over comments just seem so lame. i would rather say sorry and just move on.

 I'm fighting with sam as well.. how weird. I feel that me and sam are at a point were if we don't get things together that saddly i don't think we will be friends much longer more so by her choice...Every other fight its me telling her she is selfish or shes telling me i am. it all comes from being fusterated. and missing each other but julie controls me and sams friendship down to the second of every sonversation and movment.. and i don't drive and i am not able to come to a game she has down here wednesday because its at 6.. earl and matthew her home at 5. earl goes to school and i work on tuesdays and thursdays.. the time we spend together is very important to us right now. and then at 9 i have to be at the dock.. so if i went that means i would not see earl all day. i know to some that might sound like not a big deal but it is..with our schedules we only get so much time to spend together so..i just don't know.
She does come to alot of my shows and i have only been to one game of hers but i do not drive, they hardly come down her because julie says gas is so expensive so if i was to go to a game they would have to come get me, take me there, bring meback and then go back home. that would be over $200 in gas.. i realize this is her only game in cincy but i simply can not go. If the tables were turned sam would want to come but julie would not let her. so..i just don;t know what to say or what to do..but i guess just let things happen the way they happen. i love sam to death,,she will never believe that but i do. 

I am under some stress with my shows. Yadda is becoming so hard to get people to come to. even the lesbians. Purgatory is maken changes every week,,,i just wish things would chill and settle. So..we will see.

Randi and amber are going thro a very ruff time and i am just trying to be there the best i can. i have not really talked to randi much. i talked to amber alot more latley.
randi is out running around doing what have u..ilove her but she is so confussed and is just running and running from things but its more like running in cirles then getting anywhere..i wish her luck. Poor amber is just trying to be strong and just sway with the motions. shes one of the strongest people i have meet but at the same time she has more demons then i thought..

like i said a year ago i would have been so wrapped up in all this i would be listening to sad music just going off.. but nowi am just typing whats up and rolling with the ball...

ok well me and earl are doing well. tonight he held me in his arms for about a hour and we just talked about how we never wanna be without eachother and how safe our home feels. and just how lucky we are. I love that man so much. we both are chasing our dreams head on and the best thing is we are makening it..

my family is all doing well. i think i am going out to see my mom and dad this weekend.
i can't wait until the holidays at my grandmals..

(sam u should call me so we can talk everything out).
(jennifer i love u)..
(randi i am her when u stop running).
(amber...i am here for u..remember that).

like yesterday i had a dream about nomi and i missed her alot yesterday. i didn't let myself call her even tho i really wanted to. Strange how things happen.
so i was just cleaning my house and i looked outside and i seen yellow leafs all over the road and i got so excited.. i ran to my computer pulled up the calendar and counted the days until November 1st. Omg my Christmas tree is go going up on November 1st. 
i can not wait. I have the holiday bug running thro me. i was downtown yesterday and all the stores had xmas trees in them. They was so pretty so for xmas this year i want everyone to get me orderments for my tree that represent them. I have a couple that people have got me thro the years but i want more because xmas makes me remember people i have forgotten. like Jessica, her and amber got me a heart orderment a couple years ago. thinking about that makes me sad because she has been in cincy like 3 times and everytime she has been her she hasn;t called me once or seen me which is shitty but i guess i remind her of 2 much but others don't lol? but owell.
I thought about matt nomis x the other day.. i wonder what hes doing? lol random thought? so yeah i am so excited about this cold weather and snow and xmas yeeeeh...
I am going to have a big thanksgiving dinner again this year. gotta start planning that soon.  i WANNA go to us nightmare really bad Lol how random.
So purgatory is going pretty well. we have a big show coming nov 8th, i hope it rocks.
adonis night club and i have talked about me doing shows there so wish me luck.

A true will always stay
A true friend looks out for you 

A true friend will guard your secrets
Like a precious gift
A true friend is there for you
To give you a helpful lift 

A true friend tries to make you smile
Tries to replace that frown
They may not always succeed 
But they rarely let you down 

These arms for you are open
This heart for you does care
And when I think you need me
I'll try to always be there 

I'll listen to your fears
I promise not to laugh
Comfort your falling tears
I'll make this friendship last 

I'll keep you near to my heart
I'll always hold you dear
Even when we're miles apart
Even when you're here

Thursdays show was a flop..i booked 6 dragkings which to me were not that bad but to many people they hated it, alot of people didn;t come because of the theme and alot left when they came and saw the theme. People have there taste so theres nothing i can do. i tryed to book them and see like the owner ask and well we had 30 people show up at 11:45. all together i think it was 70. Plus a big fight broke out. so the night was just a joke. sam and julie came which was awesome. randi and amber was there as well. randi got really drunk and pissed me off at the end. but owell.

friday i spent the day with my two boys and loved it. it was our first week dealing with the new schedule so we made sure friday made up for it. 
friday night i went and seen Emiley Rose.. omg it was scary and very good.
i had a good time with jenn. it was a weird night. but fun.

saturday spent the whole day with earl. we watched alexander. cleaned house, went shopping, had dinner and had a cute night together. around 10 randi and amber picked me up and we went to there house and watched CRASH!! omg i love that movie.
we had a nice night together.

sunday i watched crash again with earl. had lunch.. did the thing couple do for hours lol hahaha.. good day.

it has been in ly life for over 3 years. long then most friends lol. haha

So today was the perfect day for the most part.
Woke up at like 1.. earl didn;t come home for lunch because of work so that sucked.
so i cleaned my house and watched oprah. I love that show. God i am old lol.
So earl and matty came home. I miss matthew during the day now.. Every year when he goes back to school i have to get back to being alone most of the day and night. I get depressed for about a week then i FALL inlove with my alone time. Its nothing to do with anyone its just me being who i am lol.
So i do not really wanna write about whats going on with me and sam but i will say that i think its best our friend takes a break for a while. who knows if we will ever return but a break is needed. Its sad that this has to happen but Lets just say she kinda Made it happen. So i am listening to Tina Turner - i don't really wanna fight anymore.
I don't wanna fight anymore. i don't care who is the blame. i don't care whos wrong or right. But the one thing i do know is I will miss Sam. She showed me what friendships are expost to be like. She showed me the true meaning of loyalty. She had her ups and downs but she was an Amazing friend and I do believe at one point we Was closer then i have ever been with someone. I hated that to be friends with her or to remain friends with her i had to do things i didn't wanna do. I hated that her joulousy controls her But MAINLY i love You Sam. I even care about julie and i will Miss You both.
I have never been treated the way u treated me sunday night..you broke my heart..*sigh*.

Ok so............
Big news.. I talked to The modeling Agency today on the phone after SHE emailed me.
I am going to meet u with her soon and sign some papers and i will be signed with WAM! MODELING/TALENT AGENCY!!! they are already looking for some work for me. I am excited!!!
this is a very big step in my career. I may even travel. Omg this could be the biggest thing yet!

Ok well my birthday party is sunday. Hope it goes well.

All this time is passing by
I think it's time to just move on

When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me
When you come around
I'll be there for you
Don't have to be alone with what you're going through

Start to breathe and fake a smile
It's all the same after a while
I know, that you are tired
Carrying the ones you lost
A picture frame with all the thoughts
I know, you hold inside

I hope that you can find your way back
To the place where you belong

When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me
When you come around
I'll be there for you
Don't have to be alone with what you're going through

You're coming back down
You say you feel lost can I help you find it
When you come around
From time to time we all are blinded
You're coming back down
You don't have to tell me what you're feeling
I know what you're going through
I won't be the one that lets go of you

I think it's time to just move on

When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me
When you come around
I'll be there for you
Don't have to be alone with what you're going through

When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me
When you come around
I'll be there for you
Don't have to be alone with what you're going through"

 Hi Jessica!
 Thank you so much for your photos!  They are awesome!  I saved my favorties for my files for future clients. I am excited to work with you and I hope I will be able to find some events for you where you will be able to fit in comfortably.  I know I have an event in Dayton, OH at Club Masque on September 23 at 11:30pm where you would be great!  Thats a Thursday, though, and it may not be worth the drive and time away from Yadda for your show.  I am searching for other things for you and will let you know as soon as something comes up.

See you Thursday!
WAM!  Wendy 

 (i am not sure that i am going to be able to do the event that she talked about. i can't MISS a thursday @ yadda. but we will see what happens.

love jessica
(((4 days until my Birthday!!!!))))"

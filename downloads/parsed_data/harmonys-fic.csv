"event","So, I've been reading Teen Wolf fic 'cause I started watching Teen Wolf (seriously? The first season's music and such was styled after old B movies!!) and have fallen in love with the characters Stiles and Lydia.  The actor who plays Stiles has amazing physical comedy abilities, he puts me in the mind of John Ritter though for someone his age it was probably Jim Carrey that he grew up watching, and comedic timing.  

I cannot seem to find fic that sounds like Styles dead on.  Forgive me for sounding picky and judgy but none of the fics I've read, except one which was really damned close, have left me with that <i>Stiles</i> feel.  I'm tempted to try to do so myself but my only call is to my 00Q fic."

Still the most amazingly ugly piece of jewelry I have ever seen coveted, or simply ever seen, on TV or in movies.  I really hate to judge anything and by gosh and by golly I get the biggest set of giggles anytime I see that ring.  It's so painful to my eyes.  Brain bleach?  When is that going to be a thing? WHEN????"

"event","While searching for a shower curtain I came upon this review:

Great Curtain! Lava Proof!
By C****** L**** on October 3, 2014
Size Name: 72-Inch by 96-Inch Color Name: Clear Verified Purchase

I love this thing because it is tall and the rings do not tear like on crap shower curtains...assuming you use the thick plastic shower curtain rings and not the thin metal ones.

I also have my shower curtain rod all the way up near the ceiling in order to keep all the steam in the shower area and this curtain is perfect for it.

Last this curtain is great because I am pretty sure that it keeps lava out of your shower. I am no scientist...well actually I am a biochemist...but while I am no lava or curtain scientist I can say that since I have had this curtain up 100% of my shower time has been lava free. So you know...That makes this baby pretty awesome."

However every Evil Overlord I&#39;ve read about in books or seen in movies invariably gets overthrown and destroyed in the end. I&#39;ve noticed that no matter whether they are barbarian lords, deranged wizards, mad scientists or alien invaders, they always seem to make the same basic mistakes every single time. With that in mind, allow me to present...</p><p></p><center><h1 align=""CENTER"">The Top 100 Things I&#39;d Do<br />If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord</h1></center><p></p><ol><li>My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear plexiglass visors, not face-concealing ones.<p></p></li><li>My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.<p></p></li><li>My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.<p></p></li><li>Shooting is <i>not</i> too good for my enemies.<p></p></li><li>The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the Mountain of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of Eternity. It will be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object which is my one weakness.<p></p></li><li>I will not gloat over my enemies&#39; predicament before killing them.<p></p></li><li>When I&#39;ve captured my adversary and he says, &quot;Look, before you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?&quot; I&#39;ll say, &quot;No.&quot; and shoot him. No, on second thought I&#39;ll shoot him then say &quot;No.&quot;<p></p></li><li>After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks&#39; time during which the final phase of my plan will be carried out.<p></p></li><li>I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled &quot;Danger: Do Not Push&quot;. The big red button marked &quot;Do Not Push&quot; will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labelled as such.<p></p></li><li>I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel well outside my borders will work just as well.<p></p></li><li>I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat.<p></p></li><li>One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.<p></p></li><li>All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.<p></p></li><li>The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form of last request.<p></p></li><li>I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.<p></p></li><li>I will never utter the sentence &quot;But before I kill you, there&#39;s just one thing I want to know.&quot;<p></p></li><li>When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.<p></p></li><li>I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction at a crucial point in time.<p></p></li><li>I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one look at the hero&#39;s rugged countenance and she&#39;d betray her own father.<p></p></li><li>Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it&#39;s too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.<p></p></li><li>I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original uniforms for my Legions of Terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make them look like Nazi stormtroopers, Roman footsoldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All were eventually defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive mind-set.<p></p></li><li>No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.<p></p></li><li>I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.<p></p></li><li>I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line &quot;No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!&quot; (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)<p></p></li><li>No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.&quot;</li></ol><br />The list does not end there.&nbsp; Click the link.&nbsp; Feel the love.<br /><br /><a href=""http://http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html"">http://http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html</a><br /><br />Then, if you clex at all, read this: <a href=""http://danceswithgary.dreamwidth.org/283292.html#cutid1"">http://danceswithgary.dreamwidth.org/283292.html#cutid1</a>&nbsp; and laugh your patookis off.&nbsp;"

Yes, she is only a guest star, but the point is, many people don&#39;t like her and feel it was a very poor decision to have this &quot;person&quot; on the show at all. As such, they are expressing their feelings by either temporarily or permanently dropping the show. This is in hopes that it will send a strong message to the creator/writer/producers/etc. that they are not willing to sacrifice their beliefs/feelings at having someone like this be a part of a wonderful show like DDD. Standing up for what you believe is part of what this country has been made of. The fact that too many people today take the attitude of &quot;why bother&quot; is exactly why this country is falling apart, and our freedoms being taken away. If more people would stand up and say &quot;NO!&quot; then people in power would be forced to listen, and maybe rethink the decisions they&#39;re making.<br />&nbsp;<br />Yes, obviously I&#39;m making points that involve more than just this show, but those points still stand in regard to the decision of having Kim Kardashian on.<br />&nbsp;<br />For those of you taking the attitude that you&#39;re going to watch anyway, because &quot;she&#39;s just a guest star,&quot; well, that&#39;s fine, but that tells me that you probably take a similar attitude in other aspects of your life, and that you possibly don&#39;t care about anything.<br />&nbsp;<br />Obviously, there&#39;s many people who do care about things, and just because this is a show, and she&#39;s just a guest star, doesn&#39;t make our feelings any less valid than yours. We&#39;re just not willing to sit back and not have our feelings heard, because we believe that by taking your attitude and watching anyway, sends the message to the creator/producers/writers/etc., that having someone like Kim Kardashian on the show is acceptable and OK., and we just don&#39;t feel that way.&quot;</p></div></div></div>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/drop-dead-diva"">http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/drop-dead-diva</a>"

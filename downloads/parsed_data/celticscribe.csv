""To be nobody-but-yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting.""

TODAY is ELECTION DAY.

Please remember that we have a chance to elect a President today who, for the first time in my lifetime, will be elected by following a different kind of political line.

Is he still a politician.  Of course.

It starts today. As my grandfather said, 
""If you don't vote you don't have a right to complain.""
Feel good about doing your duty as a citizen of this nation.
Then remember there is more work to be done.

It is not enough for the young and disillusioned to elect Obama today.  If we allow him to, he will easily be just another polititian.  We are responsible for changing the course of this country.  When Obama wins it will be on the backs of the young, the liberal, and the jaded who supported him through the primaries and brought him this far with millions of $20.00 donations and grass-roots campaign tactics.  

THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT.  Make it count for something."

I always love the low-key get togethers where you don't have to worry about your kids running around screaming at the top of their lungs.  It was also the first time in a long time we had most of the family together in one room.

A few interesting moments...

At one point Mom saw fit to try and get me to talk to the Johnson's.  The last time I saw them Dr. Johnson was still Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Johnson was still a vaguely terrifing figure in my young life.  

Mrs. Futrel talking to me about SFCC and how Daryl is no longer teaching photography.  It seems sad to picture the art department there without him.  (Side note, I couldn't help but wonder if she remembered that the one class I ever took with her I hated and that we really didn't get along very well when I was going to school there.)

Uncle Willy walking Liam around on his foot.  I'm used to Uncle Daryl and Uncle Brent playing with my boys, but yesterday was the first time Uncle Willy did and for some reason it took me by surprise how much fun he had with my little one."

It was great to spend some time with everyone and it made me want to make the effort more often.  I was tired when I got home but it felt good to be with my cooky family for awhile.

"event","Over the last few days I've thought a lot about two little girls are very different, but both hold special places in my heart.  Alice and Katie are both turning four this month and with birthdays come presents so Dani and I went shopping on Monday to search for the perfect gifts.

Katie is easy.  She's a little bundle of energy, the only person who can wear out my two-year-old boy.  I spend a lot of time with her and she often reminds me of Dani as a little girl.  I knew that a dinosour and a pair of shorts would suit her just fine.  Easy.

And then came Alice, although it makes me sad to say it, I don't really know her that well.  Every experience I've had from her and reports from her Mother tell me that she is a girly-girl who loves dresses and pink.  As I went shopping for her I felt an urge to support this surprising little girl by purchasing the girliest gift I could find: a princess costume.  Dani was horrified.  I demured and went with something a little bit more subdued but it got me thinking.

I've been labeled ""girly"" my whole life.  Most of the women in my life have at one time or another accussed me of being a ""girl"" as if it was a label to be despised.  It makes me wonder, will Alice grow up feeling, like I did, that in order to be respected and valued she must supress the instinct to be feminine?  

A few months ago I read a book called FEMALE CHAUVINIST PIGS that addressed this topic.  The author believes that the Feminist revolution somehow became muddled and now women think that in order to be considered intelligent, successful, and worthwhile they must be like men.  It makes me furious and when I get angry I tend to get mouthy.

Tonight I wrapped Alice's present in fuschia paper and tied it up with a pretty pink bow.  If I have no other impact in my little cousin's life then this, I want to let her know that being a girl, a feminine one, is not something to be ashamed of.  I want her to know that she is strong and intelligent and beautiful because of her femininity, not inspite of it."

Yesterday I found out that not only am I going to be getting a raise, but my position is going back on the clock so there will be no more 60 hour work weeks!

There are some draw backs to the restructuring, but I think the good actually out-weights the bad this time around.

Today we went to the zoo with Mom and Ed.  It was Tristan's first time and we had a lot of fun.  He was scared of the sting-rays and the bearded pigs, but he loved the chemps and the manatees.  I'm sure we will have some great pictures when I get my film developed tomorrow.

I am starting a business.  I've found a completely insane, but lovely woman, to help finance my attempt to become a serious photographer.  As many of you know, I've harbored a love of photographs since middleschool and came very close to doing this once before.  There are only 2 proffessional photographers in Hernando County and one of them is a convicted child molestor so you can guess how well that goes over.  

Right now I'm looking at cameras, filing for an occupational license, and looking for someone to build me a website for practically no compensation.  If I can make this work over the next few months then my crazy silent partner is going to help me finance setting up a small studio to do portrait work.

Possibly due to a severe lack of sleep and an overdose of pucking and pooping 2 year old, I mistakenly called it rhino-virus yesteray which made Dania and Mom crack up.  They came up to help with the baby in the hope that we could keep him from getting sick.  So far he only has diarehia so we'll see. 

I've spent the last four days with Tristan clinging to me almost every second, and I'm exhausted.  He's finally on the uphill stretch, but he still wants to be next to me or on my lap almost constantly.  Although I am happy to be Mommy, it wears you out!

For the past two weeks I've worked close to 70 hours and barely seen my family.  I get home exhausted.  After about 2 hours of cooking, bathing kids, & reading stories I fall on to the couch in front of the TV and go to sleep.  Right now life is speeding by with no stops on the horizon.

I'm searching for a new job, but finding it difficult because I can't afford to take much of a paycut since our mortgage went up last month (damn taxes and insurance).

On the upside, I've done a lot of fun things on the weekends lately.  Tristan and I went with Mom and Dani to the Strawberry Festival last weekend and Saturday we had a St. Patrick's day dinner complete with cornbeef, cabbage, soda bread, & Irish potatoes.  Yum!!!  We also have a lot to look forward to.  Keith and I are going for a spa weekend for our anniversary and Tool will be in Tampa May 22 so we are going to see them.

The only sounds filling my quiet home right now are the rythmnic tapping of keys and the heater running (thankfully because its FREEZING outside).  This time is my therapy.  Every morning I get up and sit writing at my desk (well, today I'm at Keith's desk).  This is the only thing saving my sanity right now.

I've decided to remain with SunTrust at least for a little while.  They've offered me a position I just can't pass up.  Alex said last week that even if I do the job half-assed for a year I've still made a crap-load of money, and although I think he was probably joking, he's right.  If I can suck it up for a year or two we can pay off our credit cards and put a little money aside so that I can get my Master's and thats something I really want.  

On another note, my commitment to more time for fun things this year is actually going pretty well.  I've seen Mistie & Amy more in the past two months then in the past 2 years and we have lots of fun trips coming up soon.  Next weekend is Taryn's wedding, the weekend after that we're going to the Renaissance Festival (dorky but I love it) with Tristan, and then the following weekend to the Strawberry Festival.  Lots of fun!

And one more thing, in April Noam Chompski (I'm probably spelling it wrong) will be speaking at USF.  I know that I'm terribly nerdy, but I'm so excited that Keith and are going to go!  For a linguist proffessor, the man has some pretty groovy political ideas.  Also, I recently discovered that you can download nearly every class that MIT offers for graduate and undergraduate studies on their website for free so I'm going to go check out some of his classes.

She was never one to play dress up so I guess this must be the real thing."

"event","The past couple of weeks have been hectic but fun.  After we did the Christmas and shower thing at Mom's, Keith, the boys and I got to spend some time just hanging out together and playing.  Christmas was a little nuts, but fun.  Shannon and Bob moved into their new house that week so we spent an evening exchanging gifts with them and helping with the unpacking.  Tristan got a superman action figure that is as tall as he is, whenever he plays with it he calls it Daddy which is hilarious but I think might give keith a big head :).  We have more toys all over then I know what to do with and so Keith is really stressing that Tristan has a birthday in three weeks, but oh well.  
   We had a low key New Years, hanging with the kids at Sheila's and then later at Shannon's.  Tristan stayed up until midnight with us which might be irrisponsible, but sure was fun.  Then this morning we met my Mom at cracker barrrell and had lunch.  Tristan went with her for a few days so the house is quiet for the first time since the baby was born.  Right now Liam is sleeping on me and Keith is taking a nap.  Tomorrow is back to work, but for now I think sleep is in order..

This morning Tristan brought out his coloring pad and handed it up to me while I was in the middle of doing dishes saying, ""Mommy pees,"" my first instinct was to say ""later.""  Instead, I stopped what I was doing and got his crayons out and we sat on the floor coloring for almost an hour (a long time for a two year old!).

"event","I always wondered if two kids would make twice the mess, it seemed impossible since Tristan could manage to have every square inch of the house covered in toys, clothes, and diapers.  Over the past week I've discovered that it isn't really that they make twice the mess, its that when you have two little kids you care half as much about cleaning it up so it builds and builds and builds!  I'm trying desperately to ignore the state of my house.  This is the first time in my life that my home would probably qualify as FILTHY!

Other then the dirt everywhere we are getting along fairly well.  I usually have about 15 minutes a day when both kids are sleeping in their own beds and Keith and I can breathe.  Honestly I think thats the hardest part.  Its only been a week and I'm already in serious need of some time to myself.  Thankfully Liam is a much better sleeper then Tristan was so hopefully he will become more cooperative soon.  We've pretty much worked out a system.  Keith takes care of Tristan and I take care of the baby.  Hopefully we will eventually be able to switch rolls, but for right now it works.  I'm a little terrified of Wens. though.  Keith goes back to work that day and I'm seriously scared of having them both all by myself for 8 hours!

Last night I was in a lot of pain and up all night (which for those of you who know me well, is a very rare thing for me).  The one good thing that came of this is that I finished reading a very interesting book.  It's called VOICE OF THE RIVER and is an autobiography of Marjory Stoneman Douglas.  She was a women's rights activist before fiminism and an environmentalist before the term even existed, oh and she was a pretty good writter too.  I'd heard of her in passing during Florida history segments of classes required in high school and college, but had never learned much about her.  Although I don't think the book was particularly well written, her life is fascinating and the humbleness she possessed about it was incredible.  She did more in the last 15 years of her life (she died at 98) then most of us do our whole life.  

What I really appreciate about her is that she worked tirelessly to perserve the Everglades because she understood their importance, without trampsing through them all the time.  She believed you did not have to want to spend your life in nature to understand its importance.  This is interesting to me because it is the way I feel.  I didn't get the ""nature girl"" gene that most of the Watkins family seem to possess.  I perfer cities 95% of the time; however, the importance of maintaining the small patches of the natural world still around us does not escape me.  It makes my point of view seem a little more valid when I learn that one of the most influential conservationists in the history of Florida didn't enjoy spending time in her beloved Everglades.  Apparently, I'm not a freak!"

"event","So yesterday I got another one of Travis's annoying emails claiming that Christianity is being oppressed by ""atheists"" in America.  Of course, I couldn't just press delete, I had to say something (sometimes I think this is my fatal flaw).  Today I received a reply back from him that, to say the least, was pretty scathing.  In it he accused me of having a biased opinion.  I can't help but find this ironic considering the continent of the email that sparked my reply in the first place.  The funny thing is, if I really admit it to myself I probably am somewhat biased because of personal experience.  I have a fairly engrained hatred for organized religion, particularly conservative Christians because of the damage I have felt directly from these close minded people.  In my mind the difference is that I would fight to the death to allow anyone to believe what they want to believe because I want that freedom for myself.  Despite what some people might think, I don't need to convince anyone that I'm right where religion and spirituality are concerned, I don't think I have all the answers.  In fact, I'm fascinated by what different people believe and love to learn about religious experiences.  All I ask, is that if I can walk away allowing you your belief system, could you please extend the same courtesy to me.  And please vote with your brain and not a smoke screen of religious idealism."

In this run up to the elections it is critical to be informed (and not just by corprate America, which is what traditional media is feeding you).  If your own city doesn't have independent media available to you, check out <https://www.wmnf.org> and listen to their programming on streaming audio.  They cover public affairs from 10-2 every day and from 6-7 in the evening.  Enjoy great programs like ""Democracy Now,"" old Allan Watts speeches, ""Exploration"", ""Counter Spin"", ""Fresh Air"" (you art lovers will love this show!).  They also have great music.

Apparently he has ""weak airways"" which means that every time he gets a cold or a runny nose it is likely to turn into bronchitis.  This is apparently usually one of the first signs of asthma.  We are hoping that it he grows out of it because the doctor says a lot of kids do, but for now the doctors words were, ""daycare is really not helping and he will probably have bronchitis a lot while he's going.""  Great huh?  Keith is hoping that his Mom will volunteer to watch him again when she hears this, I guess I hope so too, but I hate the idea.

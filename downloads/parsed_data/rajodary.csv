I am so psyched. I can not wait till school starts tomorrow. i have so much fun there. I have so much i want to do.

I need to move.

Anyone who would like to the ""Raya needs to get the hell out of Agawam"" fund, i am excepting donations. (make checks payable to Raya Mutti) No but really. i have no money and i need to pay for school.

its kinda pathetic actually.

I really am having one of the best summers ever. I know its almost over and most of the time i dont want it to be, but this time.... i cant wait for school.

I have a path. I have somewhere i know i'm going. I love that i have a purpose. 

I have someone who makes me feel like i mean somthing. Not just in looks but in mind.

He makes me feel intellegent. I never had someone who made me feel smart. Who made me feel like my opions and my thoughts are important. That even though i may not have the best vocab or am very good at saying exactly what i mean that the thought behind it is what is important.

Every day he reminds me that i can be me without feeling dumb. I have talent and that i mean something. More than just an object. 

But at the same time i'm not being spoiled. hes not like some of the other guys who get on there knees and do anyhting for me. i hate that.

i want someone who challenges me everyday. and he does that. 

this is the first time in my life that i feel i can just be myslef completely and totally connect with someone on every level. I feel like i've found myself and he happends to be there with open arms.... not like before where i had to find myself in someone else.

For example.... we tlaked for hours last night... and we've been together all summer. No one else have i been able to have the deep real convos with, without gettign into some sort of argument. We have fun and dont fight... theres nothign to fight about.

its the first real MATURE relationship i've had. 

ok i'm done being a sappy dork. Sorry i've put you all through reading this... : )

Until next time~ ON THE WAY DOWN!!!"

~Nov 14 - hot snakes

thats so far.

I just got back from last nights show. The explsion and the Burning Brides... IT ROCKED! 

what rocked more was that simons idol (jeremy Weiss... Photographer) was there shooting. Right next to him. fucking so cool. I went up and said hi to him cause i actually talked to him on aim a few weeks ago about simons work (jeremy lives in la) and he liked it. So I introduced myself and asked him about la. and of course simons a shy one so he didnt go over (PUSSY!!) i think i was more exited than he was. I mean come'on.... if you saw your idol just right next to you doing the some thing as you and just being there... wouldn't you freak. Ya, i would too.

Anyway, I also had warped tour last wen. It was pretty awesome. Nothing like the explsion but awesome nonetheless. It was perfect out. Overcast with light wind. Little sun but not enough to scortch me. I saw every band i wanted to (tinc, tbs, bs) it was cool. Plus i was a new band called the matches. they fucking rocked. Best show of the day. 

I was real exited because at like 9 we got there adn we were standing in like waiting for the gates to open at like 11 and this guy from Samsung came up too us and was like want to help us out with somethign .... you get freee shirts and get to cut to the front for autograph signings of taking back sunday and the bouncing souls. We were like... sure. So we get ot go in the place at 9 and put laminates (SP?) on these necklace things. Its was fun. Then we were already in there and we got to get posters signed and stufff. I would have never waited in line for that either.... haha. 

I also got International noise conspiracy's auto's and the matches and one of the guys from yellow card. they were just standing arounds so iwas like why not ( even thoug i only like one song by YC) 

I guess it was more fun just cause i expected it to be shit. and because it wasnt ahlf bad ( minus the 13 yrs olds asking us for lighters) it wasw fun.

other than that. Summers almost over... cant wait till school. 

i like simon a lot... we have such an awesome time. thats about it for the boys... its cut down... to one. : )

You never really realize it though. Well not right away. And not so much change, just inspire.

YUCKY OCTOPUS ROCKS MY WORLD!!!!!!!!!!

I love my boys. they are so fucking awesome. I was there of course, with ""the wives club"". Amy(tony), Me(simon), Analise(chris), and even though hes really not in the band Jesse(bill). so we Cheered them on front row, center. and sat at the merch table making crude and dirty jokes and forcing people to buy stuff.... all while listening to other shitty bands.

They won too. Which isnt suprising but still awesome. More to come as well.... Skatefest baby, skatefest.

Warped tour, wen.
Explosion, sat.

SO exited for both.

and.... well i'm just happy.

other than finding out from more people how someone is talking shit to more than one person about me. Ya.... so i guess its now said i open my legs to anyone that will have me. I think its just sad because i could have more sex than that kid can even imagine and not once have to even ask for it. I choose to stay extremely clean and anyone who knew me would know that. so.... whatever. 

it just sucks. i really wish that i could have one ended relationship without the animosity. 

i suppose its my fault. i mean i am the one who for some reason just can't be happy with a relationship.

except this one. i am just happy. and every day he never ceases to amaze me.

You are right, i love the 90's. that song is not ironic. I freaking love that show.

I am so happy today. That person i like, well i wanted him to tell his friend that we really like each other and such, and his friend ofund out. and was exited for him. (like i said was going to happen)

i am so happy.

i can finally be open around them about it. 

Not like we would hang all over each other cause we are not like that at all, but. just the option of that and the fact that i dont have to feel like i'm hiding anything.

wow.

Agawam school systems can not teach spelling. I mean come on. Do you see all the misspelled words in just the first sentence?

Its funny how quickly people change. You think you know someone inside and out and then the next minute you see them and you can just see the attitude change, the pompous bastard attitude. Just like they're better than everyone around them, expecially the women. Its sad really.

Not to say that i dont have an attitude. But the most i've changed is just the way i see life. Not how i treat people. Everyone is the same. Age, sex, sexual orientation. It doesnt matter. 

I mean its not just me that sees this change in this person. Everyone who i talk to who is friends with them says the same. Which makes me feel better cause i know that i'm not just making up some bullshit to feel better about myself. (yes i am insecure and i know it) 

I really miss this person and the way they were. I wish i could take a mirror and show them what we see. Then maybe i could talk to the person again. Maybe even hang out.

I'm done with trying to reach out to them. I've done all i can. They know i'm here. and when they need me i will always be here.

I just hope its realized i'm gone in a year. Not just for school... forever. I'm moving. permanently. Off to boston. then to LA. 

well. i think i'm done venting about that. 

Other than that drama i am so happy. And comfy and >>sigh<< i dont know. if you know me and talk to me, you know what i'm talking about.

well kids... off to work i go!

Feel free to correct any spelling areas in this post. Leave a nice little comment with the correction. i will then fix them.!!! haha

1. Ted leo was fucking AWESOME. the show fucking rocked. Radio 4 was awesome too. I bought their cd.

2. Simon and I (we went to ted leo together) also saw John Cusack riding his bike in boston. So cool.

3. GO SEE NAPOLEON DYNAMITE!! I'm telling you. Fucking hystarical. HUHHHHH......

4. like i said above my hair is shorter again. i like it.

5. i really really like someone and i wish that this person cause talk to their friend. 

6. I hate when people talk shit to cause drama. Unnessisary.(even though i cant spell unnessisary, its is still that.)

7. Work is nuts. I love it but things are going down. Lots of people on the brink of losing their jobs over petty stupid shit. Not me though. 

8. my car is now offically not going to break down. I still have 3 more things i need to fix but the radiator, muffler, and brakes, oh and tire rod are fixed. i just need a tire and an alignment. and new shocks i think. But that wont cost much

well boys and girls. i think that is all that is new for now. Stayed tuned for more news 10 to the hour every hour here on Rtv.

We'll see. I have a year to worry about it. 

I am slightly exited though... when i want something to happen really bad, it does. 

I am so happy right now. I didnt know it was possible to feel this good about life. I know i have shit i have to get done but i just am so happy. I have good freinds. My family life is... well as normal as it can possiby be. I'm getting along with the ex boy. I do need to work out but i'm not totally consumed with the fact that i hate my body. I have an interest (who is by the way absolutly amazing and makes me so incredably happy) but i still get to be single. I mean whats better?

I really have nothing witty or clever to write. Not like I'm ever really witty or clever.

I just feel so good. So freakin happy. Everything is just... good. i mean besides the constant problems with money and such.

I guess its the fact that i can be me with out anyone. I dont need a boy to define who i am. or to make me feel comfortable with myself. 

Does that mean i dont have an interest? no. In fact i do have my eye on someone. 

the best part about this someone is that i can be completely and totally myself and i dont feel critizied or ugly, or dumb. We dont agree on stuff and its ok. when we do its not a huge deal. we are just... ourselves. 

the funny thing is... we are so different. but in a good way. not in a ""we have absolutly nothing in common"" way. just different personalitys. its so awesome though...

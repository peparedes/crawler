"event","I'm sorry, I have to rant.<br /><br />I hate 'men' who look too much like females. I hate it so much! ...the ones that LOOK LIKE GIRLS and don't have a lick of testosterone in their bodies, or portraits *is looking at one at the moment and is hating every second of it*. It's ridiculous. I use to really like men who had long hair (and I still do), with long eyelashes (<i>still do</i>), with beautiful features (*ahem* still do!), but they still had <b>testosterone</b> in their bodies! It really bothers me.<br /><br />My Tori (<a href=""http://yaoi.y-gallery.net/view/233817/"">evidence 1</a>, <a href=""http://yaoi.y-gallery.net/view/212414/"">evidence 2</a>, <a href=""http://yaoi.y-gallery.net/view/282207/"">evidence 3</a>) has these qualities and yet, he still has a vague---but not mistaken---'male' feeling to him, doesn't he? There was this picture.. that I saw and I mistook it for a woman. Not only was the 'male' featured wearing a dress but the eyelashes, shape of the face and the evident hips freaked me out. I think what ran through my head was 'er... that's a man?' I didn't know what to think other than the fact that so called 'man' was in fact a woman (minus the breasts). <br /><br />Now I respect people and their fetishes but to be honest with you, if it's suppose to be a man, why not draw it as a man? It's like having 'dick-women' around and we don't see them often. I accept that. Just say so, you know? <br /><br />-------------<br /><b>(X) </b>Men do not have curvaceous bodies like women.<br /><b>(O) </b>They've got straight bodies like 'boards.' <br /><br /><b>(X) </b>Men don't have plush, round cheeks like women. <br /><b>(O) </b>Even the most feminine man has a jawline. <br /><br /><b>(X) </b>Men who wear skirts (in my opinion) should be tasteful and should be recognizable.<br /><b>(O) </b>If they wear a dress, skirt... why not TRY to make them look like men or just call them women? There are women who are FLATCHESTED, but that's how they were genetically formed. Throwing a dick on them doesn't necessarily make them men---they become 'dick-women.'<br /><br /><b>(X) </b>Men with lolita-like hair with long Marie Antoinette curls (any style from the Victorian era), should look vaguely masculine or make some NOTE. Omg.<br /><b>(O) </b>I don't know if there's a plus side to this.... If the style is done correctly, then I approve but.. if not, it's a woman.<br />-------------<br /><br />There is a shitload more that I can rant about this but.. OMG on Y!G, there was this ONE girl/boy that drew this.... 'man/boy/woman/thing' and it was most definitely a freaking woman. If you want to know, just... comment on this journal or something. <br /><br />Is there a trend or something? Are there girls who like men who look like girls with dicks? Or are they just girls who like girls with strap-ons? I honestly don't know. I myself have no problem with this but the reason I joined and contributed to Y!G in the first place was because I wanted to see men and their beautiful gayness, not men who look like women with dicks.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />*bows*<br />This concludes my rant for now."

"event","The moment I got home after attending AnimeBoston, I knew that I wouldn't have a good summer. Not only does my closet space disappear because of my cousin, who is temporarily living with us, using all of my closet, which I had first (and she KEEPS ON BUYING MORE CLOTHES every time I turn around), but my things after college, have been strewn apart, all around the house. Boxes upstairs, downstairs, basement. I can't even find my gameboy that has my favorite gameboy games on it since all my stuff is everywhere. <br /><br />Recently, my mom forced me to work at the restaurant for more than 12 hours a day. Wtf? A normal work day is 8 fucking hours, that I could handle, but not 12. I'm not all that excited to NOT GET PAID for working long, boring days as well. It's fucking annoying. I get tips, but only about 20 bucks. What is this? Child Labor? I can't even leave when there ARE NO PEOPLE TO HELP OUT! When I bring up going home, I get bitched out. <em>""What are you going to do when you get home then? Nothing? Well you have to stay here because I said so."" </em>That's pretty much how the argument between my mother and I go. I had three of those today.&nbsp; I'm so sick and tired of it. <br /><br />This is why I'm looking forward to going back to college---to get away from her and my annoying family... I get the space I need and such. Another thing, everytime my mother talks to me,&nbsp; just want to get a knife and stab my heart. I just don't want to hear it anymore. She's yelling at me about various things a day but she claims it to be ""teaching"" me. Yeah, okay, parents teach their children by bitching them out every second of the day. When my mother knows how angry I am at her, she gets all nice and watches me draw my frustration out. Yeah, like I really want you around for that. <br /><br />I've noticed a current trend of suicidal thoughts I have been having this past week as well, including the knife stabbing heart thing above. I saw a metal skewer today at work, and without asking myself why, I visioned myself plunging it into my chest. I have no idea why and my hand was about to reach for it when someone said my name. Sometimes I don't even want to be alive. <br /><br />Part of the reason why I'm like this is because I need attention, people to talk to me right now; online and IRL. I feel like I've been abandoned; tossed out like an unwanted puppy. No love or anything. I hate my life and I almost wish I wasn't born at all."

"event","I'm so tired of college life. I've adjusted fine since the beginning of first semester but I'm not so sure that my own habits have changed. I believe myself not to be a nice person by nature. When I am brooding I look unhappy, angry and downright mean. I can't put on fake smiles that other people have the ability to. When I am unhappy, it shows on my face and when I'm depressed, it shows on my face. I will not talk about it and I tell you that now. That's just how I am, though I will listen to what you have to say. I am also a very blunt person, if I don't like something, I will downright tell you no matter what the consequenses may be. I don't tiptoe around anyone, not even my parents.

I think that going to China this summer will do me some good. I'm so tired.. I'm just so tired of being here in Massachusetts--the United States.. I'm so tired of people talking one way then doing another. I'm so tired of it. I look forward to going to class in the morning, I look forward to class in general and I look forward to learning, despite the things I really hate... But I'm...just so tired. I need to be alone...

I sometimes wonder if I was born in the right place and sometimes I wonder what would it have been like if I was born in China and not in America. Would it have been better for me? I feel so incomplete because I only know half my language and because work keeps getting in my way, I can't learn as much as I'd like to. 

I am not an obsessive person: I know I act like it but I am not. I'd like to say that I am normal. So in saying this, I don't understand obsession, the disease, the compulsive need to do/buy something just because it's of such and such. I don't understand it. Even my obsession with yaoi has died, I'll admit that. I don't buy as much as I did, I buy regular things, like I always had. I like regular things... I can't and will not obsess about something that is not important. I'm tired of obsessing over things or people. *sighs* 

I'm depressed but not enough to kill myself. I may not show it sometimes, but it's true. Being the oldest in my immediate family, I wasn't as concerned about being the best and I admit that and that is not important now. But now I feel like that has to be the case now, not just because all of us here are competing in the job market, but even amongst the closest of friends. I don't understand why this is so irritating...

I read in a forum that there are caucasians who think of Chinese as second best to the Japanese. What the hell? I don't think so. We're equal, if at all anything, it should be the Chinese to be the better. If it were not the Chinese, Japan would not be Japan as we know it. That little fact is the truth and there really is no arguing it, not that there is any kind of argument since if you look back in history, CHINESE PEOPLE WENT TO THE ISLANDS OF JAPAN. -_- Therefore Chinese people were the root of Japan. I think this has and is the main reason of my irritation lately. WE ARE NOT SECOND BEST, ZOMG! ><!!!"

"event","When I first got my computer, about six or seven years ago, I use to roleplay online all the time and gamble away my life on it because I didn't have a life or much work or interest in drawing as I do now back then. I love to rp, trust me, I really do, but slowly, that inspiration to do so is slipping. The lack of time is contributing to this as well as life is catching up with me. There is so much I want to do that it hurts to decide what I should do with my free time... I want to hang out with my friends, I want to draw, I want to work on my comic, I want to go to work to get money... So much to do with so little time to do it in. *sighs*

Original roleplays are wonderful things, but I'm in need of something unoriginal now. I need to stretch those alternate universe writing skills of mine now.. I'm particularly craving some Hikaru no GO! loving right now and also I want to do a little more YuGiOh rping too.. (JouxKaiba) I miss all of that... but I don't know... *dies* X____x;

"event","Cartoon Network, specifically Adult Swim and anything dealing with
Anime in general, really just loves pissing me off. Not only that but
it probably gets other Anime fans off as well. Just by the way they
fucking <b><i><font size=""+5"">NUKE</font></i></b> original Japanese
anime when they bring it stateside. Although I know many people
appreciate that they get SOMETHING rather than nothing from this
company, and many others, why couldn't they produce something that was
of fucking, at least <b><i><font size=""+3"">GOOD</font></i></b>
quality? Haven't they heard of it!? Oh my goddess, if you get the
licence to a fucking kick-ass anime then you should at least do a good
job on it! Don't just hire RANDOM PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB! Actually LOCATE
FUCKING PEOPLE WHO ARE FANS TO DO IT!!!! GODDESS FORBID IT!<br><br> Below is a
cut to a 'letter,' rather complaint to Cartoon Network. Personally, I
think I was being too nice... -_-<br><br><br>
<lj-cut>
[Addressing Naruto and FMA]
To be quite frank, the english version of Naruto is nothing in
comparison to the original Japanese show. I think it would be better to
use the original Japanese opening with subtitles, R*O*C*K*S, than
this... poor english version... Not only does the english opening
splice the entrances from both the first and second seasons, but there
are parts taken from the latter episodes of the series put in. In
addition, the music going along with this... this new opening is so
obscenely grotesque and has no feeling at all to it, like R*O*C*K*S
does. In additon, it's very hard to listen to. I'd also like to say
that the English Dubbing is horrible... simply horrible. I wouldn't
watch it even if I was paid. When I watched the first episode, after
two minutes, I left the room. I'm sorry but I just wanted to address
these opinions, as I've been keeping track of the series since the very
beginning till now in Japan. However, I'm sure that I'm not the only
one to see how dissapointing this anime has turned out to be in
english.
In the same seat, Fullmetal Alchemist has been ruined. The quality is
just as, or even worse, than Naruto. The first opening song to this
series is 'Melissa,' not 'Ready! Steady! Go!.' Why would you change the
songs? It's unclear to me, and a few acquaintances, why you've done
this... Again, I've had a hard time watching this.. I'm very tired of
being disappointed.</lj-cut><br><br><br>
I'd like to also add that the One Piece anime has greatly disappointed me as well. The shitty voice acting has made me ward off ANYTHING from that author and anime. In addition, 4kidsTV anime quality sucks worse than Cartoon Network. If you don't like what I'm saying, shove it."

"event","Yesterday morning, after I woke up, I began to cry.<br>
<br>
It's been almost a month since I left home and I haven't had the chance
to go home once. I see everyone else able to go home every weekend and
I envy that. I think having my <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">period</span>
start that day contributed to my cry that morning. From the moment I
woke up, I had a sudden flashback of my home back in Palmer, inside my
little house in the Boonies. I remembered little things such as my
room, my bathroom, my former grandparent's room, which is now my
cousin's room, my parents' bedroom, the den, the kitchen, then leading
to the back porch where there is an homegrown garden full of vegetables
and a concave sandpit hill with an ocean of dried tall grass... All the
little things... thinking about it <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">now</span> has me at ropes even now, the tears are coming... <br>
<br>
I miss everyone, my cousins, even the little monster, my parents and my
brother. I miss everyone. I want to go home. So hopefully for this long
weekend, I can. I would love to go home for a few days. I don't enjoy
taking buses with complete strangers to the place of my origin. If I
get go to home, I hope to be able to see my old friends too. I haven't
talk to them in so long... I miss everyone. Boston is so big that I
worry what will become of me. As far as I know, I haven't changed at
all. Not from high school to college. All I know that has changed is my
clothes and my hair. That's all; nothing else.<br>
<br>
Later in the evening, I began to cry again. I was bogged down with
stress about my homework assignments and it's hard. My schedule hardly
allows me to adjust too much. I have things I want to do, and there are
things I need to do... I can't seem to be able to do one or the other
and that makes me go numb with anxiety. I know that there has to be
balance but that's easier said than done. There has to be mental and
physical balance as well as schedule balance between school and social,
or in my case, personal. It's not just homework that is getting to me.
No... <br>
<br>
It's the 'hermit' stuff. Because of homework, I have no social life.
It's do one and sacrifice the other. Being asian doesn't help in this
situation because all my life, I was taught that education is the most
important above all else. Well, I can't exactly do that because I want
to have a life outside of school, outside of school work, outside of
teachers and such. *sigh* All I want to be is a doujinshi manga artist,
then a full fledged yaoi artist, nothing more. All this stuff they
teach here seems to be aimed towards Fine Arts. <br>
<br>
To everyone who likes Fine Arts, I'm sorry, but I don't particularly
have a taste in it. I wouldn't say that I hated it, but it's pretty
darn close. I didn't come here to learn fine arts. I came here to learn
Illustration and Animation... I'm starting to think now that maybe I
should have signed with the Art Institute of New England, then maybe I
would have a better chance at getting to where I wanted to go in the
first place since in that school, the teachers focus on each student's
individual interests.<br>
<br>
How depressing... Well, let's talk about my day <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">today</span>.---&gt; I was talking to MegMeg, and she asked me if I wanted to go to an Arashi Concert in Japan for Winter. I was like: ""<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">O</span>_<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">O</span> Really!? I wanna go!</span>""
And I'll be saving money for that! YAY!!!!!!!!111111oneoneone!!!
However, the only hitch is that I need to wait for MegMeg to get the
word from Tomo, her friend in Japan. I hear the only way to get tickets
to an Arashi Concert is through a Fan that is in an Arashi club there,
which doesn't sound strange.. It sounds practical to me. <br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to winter in Japan then! Hot guys, me.. hot guys, shinjuku, anime, yaoi books... hot guys... *drool*<br>"

"event","Recently, with all the overflowing homework from school, I haven't been
able to spend a lot of time with my friends, or the little that I have.
Aside from yesterday, attending the Anime Club meeting, I've been
feeling depressed and all that sort... And from the other day, being
called anti-social, I'm starting to think so too. Because of school, I
haven't been able to do a lot of fun things. If I wasn't so worried
that I would fail out of school, then I would go out and do something
fun and something that I want to do instead of doing my
responsibilities. I feel that homework, and all this crap, is sucking
away my life force in a way... *sighs* I need time to myself again. I
wouldn't mind going back home and staying there for a day. At least I
would have a few hours to myself to not worry about my life.<br>
<br>
I'm trying my best to balance my school life and my personal life right
now, but currently, it's not working too well. I hope that the teachers
will go easier on me, even a little, over the course of the next few
weeks.. I really need to tend to my other responsibilities too.... Like
planning out my cosplaying costume for next May for AnimeBoston. I'm
hoping that the members of the anime club will help me too. It'll be my
first convention! &lt;3<br>
<br>
Another thing I'd like to work on is my online comic. I haven't worked
on it at all since I moved here at the beginning of September and I
feel that I'm disappointing my fans.. T_T Must. work. on. it!!!!!! X_X
*sighs* I'm so utterly useless...<br>"

"event","Hopefully, this time, I won't waste a good livejournal.
My last one was pretty much dead.. I stopped using it for about two
years now and I wasn't interested in writing about mu life until I
started college. <br>
<br>
It's an interesting school and already I met a lot of people who have
the same interests as me. Molly and Val, awesome people. ^,^ Everyone
is friendly actually, not that I didn't expect that. But I did. I met
up with every one I met at orientation too and everything seems to have
fallen into place. Save for the fact that a creepy guy, nicknamed Goku,
kinda haunts my friends and eye... Assertively plugging himself into
the same table we're sitting at... It's hard looking at him or even
speaking to him... He has that 'Igor,' from Frankenstein, feeling of
him and speaks like him slightly too... <span style=""font-style: italic;"">kowai</span>...... *shivers*<br>
<br>
The only thing I don't like about college is that no matter how much
homework you do, you will always get ten folds more. Teachers really
have no mercy for their students. Not to mention the huge books we are
required to buy and how expensive they are. No wonder college kids are
so poor and are forced to eat Ramen bowls, not that that is too bad. <br>
<br>
In addition, my friends, in the dorm hall I live in, keep on asking me
to hang out with them, calling me anti-social. I don't think that's
true at all. Coming from an asian family, I was taught to put my
education first before all else. I don't believe this, however, I do
believe in the balance of both worlds, socializing and school. I'm not
going to college to pay <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$34,000</span>
just to socialize with people. No way. My education comes first and
when I think I'm ready to stop and go socialize, I will... *sighs*
Honestly.<br>
<br>
Hanging out is fun, yes, but I have another life too. ~_~;;;<br>
<br>
Anywho.. I'm tired. Bed looks mighty seductive. Ashita ja ne!<br>"

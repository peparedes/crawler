wow summer will be amazing...like spring break all over again.&nbsp; which was the time of my life.&nbsp; haha kinda bad cuz i cheated on my ex...but still a good time.&nbsp; it wasnt my fault, i tried really hard to break up with him before i left...but the damn kid started crying and getting WAY too emotional on me.&nbsp; im like damn boy you are acting like a girl would in this situation.&nbsp; that is usually how it works...i always end up with over emotional guys who freak the fuck out when i dont want it anymore.&nbsp; and then they get pissed cuz ""i'm not showing any emotion toward it."" im sorry but im already over you.&nbsp; but i guess i get that fron hanging out with the guys all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
oh yea i forgot about the little choice i made over spring brea too.&nbsp; i was having a hard ass time deciding between grand valley and western for school next year...and finally chose drand valley.&nbsp; i figured that if i went to western i would just party way too much...and probably get myself in trouble...fuck up and not get into med school.&nbsp; i mean i dont doubt that i would of had the time of my life there but i just wouldnt of gotten where i want in life...plus i gotta get through the nezt four years so alayna and i ccan get our apartemnt...which will be AMAZING.&nbsp; god i love that girl to death.&nbsp; dont know what im gunna do with out her right next to me all the time...the two of us are a fucking team.&nbsp; it's gunna suck but we are just gunna have to make up for not seeing one another that much during school, over the summers.&nbsp; how much do i love summer....a whole cock load.&nbsp; yea well kids that is all im writing at the moment cuz i gotta go run and do more shit.&nbsp; i promise ill update sooner than i did this time.&nbsp;"

"event","so this semester is supposed to be a big blow off right!?!?! well damn for me it sure the hell is.  i mean yea it is nice having easy classed cuz then i can actually study for the classes that i need to instead of having to do bull shit owrk for teachers who cant even teach in the first place.  yes i do love p-shot but i'm sorry her class was the biggest waste of my time.  having to write a 12 page paper about listening and how wer plan to improve on our skills was pretty much bull shit.  yea i loved my internship for that class but the actual class pretty much blew.  i mean i have all this free time where i can actually work on stuff for classes that are going to mean something to my gpa...like chem.  yea that 66 on my final kinda killed my grade.  but you know why i didnt get to study...well i was doing all this damn work for youth connections.  so anyways here is my classes: 

first hour: i'm in the library to work on stuff for my lcc class but instead i do my other homework or sit here and update this.  pretty simple.  plus im in here with jim and jason, so it is a good time.  oh and my gum makes me smell like a strawberry blunt they decided.  it isnt even strawberry flavored.  

second hour: self determination.  i thought that this class was going to be pretty stupid...but i really like it.  maybe cuz we dont do anything in there or cuz i am learning stuff that i will actually use in the real world.  it is basically a college prep class...teaching you everything you need to know about life before you move outta the house.  

third hour: possible my favorite class.  independent study photo with price.  i got to go in teh dark room yesterday.  oh my word i missed it in there.  like all i did was play around with mynegative from last year but it was still a blast.  plus the fact that im the only one in there is so nice.  i can just turn the music up and get in my mode. there is just something about the dark room.

fourth hour: well im an aid for snook again so i grade papers or do homework. it is nice.  she is a pretty cool person too.  a total health freak but still cool.  

fifth hour: chem.  yea that pretty much sucks.  the fact that im the ONLY senior in there makes me feel pretty damn smart.  but it is to my advantage cuz i have to take my my first year in college and that is the vclass that most people fail.  but i have leann and joe in there. so we sit in our little corner and talk about drugs. it is a good time.

sixth hour: international issue with mr b.  a pretty sweet class.  we do projects all year long.  i love projects.  and it is always entertaining to hear what emily, jake, or jim are going to say next.  we are going to be learning about the drug trafficing from south america and i was like ooo we should watch blow and jake was like holy shit mr b we HAVE to watch blow when we learn about that.  it made me smile."

<P>so saturday i went to work.&nbsp; that was pretty fun actually.&nbsp; got out of work and went to camilles to get ready for the party.&nbsp; then we went to amanda's...i changed.&nbsp; then we all went.&nbsp; the party was pretty lame.&nbsp; but after a few beers i didnt care much anymore and i just made it fun.&nbsp; i made out blake.&nbsp; probably shouldnt of done that cuz he keeps on calling me now.&nbsp; im like dude leave me alone i was drunk and i just wanted to make out with someone.&nbsp; now everyday nick is like beth you should have sex with him.&nbsp; oh ok nick since i am a whore.&nbsp; after we left the party we went to mcdonalds and got some food.&nbsp; it was fun talking to the guy.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; then amanda dropped us off at camilles.&nbsp; we started watching a moive but both of us fell alseep.&nbsp; i think we both woke up around 7 to some guy preaching on tv.&nbsp; we both looked at eachotehr and tried to find the clicker but couldnt so just went back to sleep.&nbsp; i kept on fantasizing about water.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; </P>
<P>sunday.&nbsp; didnt go to church.&nbsp; went over to my moms to downlaod songs.&nbsp; wow im a loser who has no life.&nbsp; hmmm yea.&nbsp; went to dinner with my grandparents.&nbsp; the left for south africe on tuesday.&nbsp; </P>

i've seen it all too many times
it's the fall from glory
that makes you feel

place your needle to the record, stab it down
it feels good to be the one to break the skin
so run with me now, look at me now
you're face down, tell yourself you're happy once again
right now you need this more than anything
but it's never enough, it's never enough for you

and it's the same old story
i've seen it all too many times
it's the fall from glory
that makes you feel alive

and you know the hardest truth can flow like water now
break down, the moment that it touches your mouth
so place your lips against the bottle, take it down
it feels good to lose control of everything
but i wasn't myself, i wasn't myself she said

i've seen it all too many times
it's the fall from glory

can anyone feel, can anyone see
can anyone taste the poison that we need

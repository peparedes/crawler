"event","My darling picked me up from the airport last night and when we got to the car, there, sitting in the seat was an Alice in Wonderland pop-up book!  It's so beautiful.  It's the best pop up book ever.  It's so detailed and wonderfully fun because you get to be a part of her world.

Then he took me to Marble Slab and got me a giant ice cream cone with extra sprinkles all over and didn't even mind that I only ate a bit of it.

But why do I feel like something is wrong?  We had a talk last night until late into the night and it was scary how much he knew.  He said he could tell when he picked me up that I wasn't fully there.  He knew how I keep things bottled up inside of me until they just come bursting out.  He knew more than I did.  He said he would do anything to make me happy and I said that I needed some time to figure out what I needed.  

But the problem is, I don't know.  I'll never know.  I love him so much.  So why does something feel missing?"

"event","I'm still in Bastrop, Louisiana.  Today I took pictures of the Bastrop town square parade.  At first there wasn't much to photograph and I felt as if I was going out of my mind!  You see, I've been having this problem quite a bit lately.  I feel rushed to get a perfect picture and I feel like there's so many opportunities but I just can't get to them in time.  There's so much I don't know where to start.  And I'm so concerned with this, I can't even look around to find something to photograph.  I feel so much pressure when I have my camera on my neck.  Like it ways me down.  And I know that's so silly.  And as soon as my camera is not with me, I see all the perfect shots in the world.  Everywhere.  All around me.

But today, at the parade, one family changed all that.  They were what I've been looking for.  They made me calm down.  They were perfect.  A young mother, maybe a little older than me, holding a newborn baby squatting beside her young husband in a baseball cap and a tank top.  Their young son beside them squinting in the sun.  And the grandmother, missing several teeth and wearing way too much make-up for the day time.  The young boy looked directly into the camera while the rest pretended I wasn't even there.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.  And in front of them, a pile of spilled sunflower seeds.  It was all too good to be true.  I wanted to take a whole roll.  I wanted to take them home and take pictures of only them for the rest of my life. Of course I only took 5 because I didn't want to bother them too much."

"event","So the picnic basket works wonderfully!  On Sunday, Sean and I had the quaintest little picnic ever.  The menu consisted of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, strawberries, and 7-layer cake.  The tableware was a lovely deep blue.  Oh, and the drinks were Thunder Punch.  All in all, an excellent trial run.  I am greatly looking forward to the real thing.

Bowling was also surprisingly fun.  Unfortunately, Nick couldn't make our little triple date, but, nevertheless, Jennah, John and Ashley, and of course, Sean, showed up.  We bowled til we dropped.  Or at least until Sean's hand nearly fell off.  It was nice hanging out with Jennah and Ashley again.  Hopefully it won't be so long until next time.  In fact, slip-n-sliding was mentioned for one night.

Last night Ann and Pawpaw took Sean and I to La Griglia for my birthday dinner.  It was really good.  We had delicious Concorde cake.  Sean had a wonderful time, I think.  It was a lot of fun having him there.  It made me giddy happy inside.  They gave me my great-grandmother's watch.  It's beautiful.  I absolutely adore it.  It is a thick gold bracelet, almost to the point of a bangle but not so stiff, and when you flip up a piece of the bracelet, there's a cute little watch inside.   You wouldn't even know it's a watch, really, since it just looks like a bracelet.  I love love it.  Also Ann gave me a book on manners written by kate spade.  It's quite fortunate because there's often little instances where I don't quite know what to do."

"event","The past two days have been terribly wonderful.  Too good to be true, really.  On Friday Sean and I went to see Farenheit 9/11.  It was so crowded but we got tickets.  It was very interesting.  I enjoyed it.  Oh and we have made the realization that getting apple juice with popcorn at the movies is delicious.  After stopping by Sean's work to get his paychecks which were slightly higher than mine was, we scurried on home to get ready for (EEE!) Diane Arbus.  Sean looked so handsome.  I love his suit.  We were all dressed up and it was lovely fun.  We went to the lecture about her and I thought it was pretty interesting.  The woman speaking read some of Diane Arbus' letters and talked about how she went about getting her pictures.  She used to start talking to interesting people in Washington Square Park and end up asking if she could go home with them to photograph.  Talk about guts!  I hope one day I could do something like that.  And after the lecture we saw Mrs. Merwin.  It was exciting to talk to her again.  I miss her.  

When we walked into the exhibit, it was overwhelming excitement!  Oh!  It was too beautiful.  White walls covered in beautiful 18' by 24' medium format pictures.  Face to face with the pictures I've oogled over in the book.  And some I hadn't ever seen before!  The newborn baby picture was there!  And the suburban family!  They had it all!  Even her cameras!  And her collage wall!  It was too good to be true.  There was a lovely little one she took of girls at a fat camp.  And a beautiful 35mm one of a man and a wife eating dinner.  I want to go back every day.  Afterwards, Sean took me to Bon Appetito.  I love Bon Appetito.  It's in a house with little red rooms with white trim with plants and pictures everywhere, only lit by lamps.  And they have a cute little man who walks around playing a guitar and singing.  It's so personal and wonderful.  Not to mention, delicious.  It makes you feel so lovey-dovey and there's nothing wrong with that. 

Yesterday was my birthday and when I woke up, Sean came over with a dozen yellow roses and a dozen pink/coral roses.  They're so beautiful.  He also gave me the Japanese photography book with is amazing.  The pictures are beautiful.  So classic and grainy!!  Very inspiring.  AND he brought 7 layer cake and turtle cookies(the kind COATED in frosting)!  Also Mom took me shopping yesterday and we hit up the club Monaco.  Club Monaco is theee best.  It was fun.  Oh and Sean brought me the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Missy Elliot.  Hell yes.  I got my groove on, to Sean's embarassment. haha, I can't believe he gave me those.  I would think he would strongly disapprove. He says we are never to speak of this again.  Haha.  Silly Sean.  Then last night Dad took our family and Sean to Damian's and it was yuuummy.  That Mona Lisa salad never lets me down.  And the Infusione de Chocolate?! UUuuuuuuuuuh.  Heart attack WELL worth it.  

And when we got back, Sean gave me the present from just him (the book was from him and his parents).... A PICNIC BASKET!!! Oh my god, it's so perfect.  It's adorable.  It's like a straw weave on the outside and it's line with blue gingham on the inside.  It's really big and comes with plate and cups and forks and knives and spoons!  And little places to strap them in!  And then inside the basket was a picnic blanket and like a pound of chocolate and the bracelet I had wanted a long time ago!  He had remembered and it was so cute!  We're going to have a picnic today and it's going to be so wonderful!  It was the best present ever.  I can't believe he thought of all that.  Sean's so amazing.  I love him so much. 

And even today's going to be great!  After our picnic, Sean and I are going on a triple date with Jennah and Nick and Ashley and John.  We're going to bowl til we drop!!  I think it's quite possible I'm the happiest person in the world.  And if anyone's happier, than that's just sick!"

First a lecture called ""Two or Three Things I know about Diane Arbus""  then the members party to see the pictures!!!  And Sean will wear a suit and I'll wear a dress and it will be the best day of my life, right beside my wedding day of course.

Tonight Sean and I looked at these beautiful trips online.  They were soooo beautiful.  To Italy and Mexico and uuuuuuuuh.  We looked at the honeymoon trips just for giggles and uuuh got so caught up in it and it was wonderful.  Sean is so funny when he sees something comfortable.  He gets so excited.  I want to go on romantic getaways with him!  Oh Oh!

But I wonder what I'll be able to say is my B._.  What certain thing will change everything so that it is either before ____ or after____ and that's all there is.  Tonight Sean and I watched Disney Weddings on the food network.  It was so exciting.  I want to have a Mad Hatter tea party bridal shower!  Uh huh.  *pouts* and *feels dumb for pouting about a stupid tea party*.  Who the hell wants one of those anyway.  Psh.  Today at the phone store Dad was acting especially silly and pretended to trip over everything.  Ali joked about how funny it would be if out of the blue, she slugged mom in the face.  Mom retaliated with her ""karate kicks"", pointed out a bump on my ear, and exclaimed she would be next door buying more shoes.  Meanwhile, Dad tried to squeeze my ear off while Ali typed the word ""poopoo"" on some high-tech phone called a blackberry.  All this is a dead quiet cingular phone store with 3 employees staring.  We must have appeared to be quite the family.  Indeed.

P.S. For our anniversary, Sean took me to Buon Appetito.  Our waiter was old and when he brought our food he set it down, gestured toward it with his hand, and yelled ""Look at this!  Look at this!""  

P.P.S. Sean and I just had a nice little conversation.  I laid on his tummy so we could be face to face and we talked like best friends.  Because we are, see.  That's the best thing, having your boyfriend be your best friend and all.  Oh, and getting to kiss after having those best friend talks.  Those are the best of the best."

Yesterday, Sean and I saw Coffee and Cigarettes.  We thought we could go without popcorn but, really, who are we kidding?  The movie was showing different people, sitting around talking, while smoking and drinking coffee.  It was original and funny.  Dull at times.  Was disappointed by Meg and Jack White.  But Bill Murray, RZA, GZA scene was wonderful.  And last scene was beautiful. 

Jennah's graduation party was yesterday.  I didn't get to stay long and I was sad because I really wanted to.  But I did have my tarot cards read.  Apparently I have an abnormal amount of feminine and emotional energy tied up in me.  Who would of thought?  And from my name?  Creativity, attempt to keep everything balance, looking at things from different perspective. And baggage.  Hmmph.

"event","Today was the last day of school.  I left the note I wrote for Mrs. Merwin in her box and Sean and I cleaned out our lockers.  It was sad.  Every stupid little thing seems sad.  Then we went to the brunch, but being in the cafeteria is much too intimidating, so we left.

Dear Jesus, 
Get me a job.  
Amen.
P.S. Oh and a Prada dress.
Amen for real.

Sean took Ali and I to see Shrek 2.  Veery funny.  Then tonight Sean's parents took us to Damien's in honor of our graduation.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.  Mona Lisa salad.  *orgasms*  MMMMMMMM.  If I won a billion dollars, I'd buy the chef who makes that salad and keep him forever.  

After dinner, I forced Sean to take a bike ride with me.  It was super fun.  We rode all over the place, and then went to the Condit playground and lay down and looked at the sky.  I thought it was romantic.  He said it felt like he was butt-raped (by the bike, not me).  Still, I had the time of my life.  

P.S.  Coolest movie of all time=Back to the Future.  Psh."

Truly the experience of a lifetime.  

Now my darling is coming home from work.  Perhaps I should have a drink prepared for him when he gets here.  And whatever shall we do tonight?  Oh!  The wonderfulness of summer.  

I said goodbye to Mrs.Merwin yesterday and cried.  I lost it when she teared up.  I know I'm super lame and I didn't think I would, but it was just so sad.  And saying bye to my art table was quite devastating, but I'm all cried out.  I'll miss everything.

"event","On Friday, Sean rescued me from my horribly dull economics class.  He swooped in the door and held up a video camera he had borrowed from someone and heroically exclaimed, ""I need to see Colleen Schultz for an interview.""

Later, Sean was interviewed on why he did not do drugs.  When asked how he had fun without drugs, he proudly stated, ""I have popcorn.""

I feel really funny.  Quite odd indeed.  High school's over.  So...now what?  I was just getting comfortable and know you're throwing me out!?  It's like I don't want to leave but I sure as hell don't want to stay!  I can't walk the streets of NYC by myself!  I'm just a kid!

Sigh, drama.

Last night, Sean and I fought, which was horrible, but afterwards made up for it.  We talked on the phone for two hours and read old diary entries when we had first met each other.  He decoded his entries from December to show how much he had liked me.  It was so cute and it made me giddy.

On another note, who knew graduation gifts were so awesome!  My parents got me a laptop!  Now I can play the Sims everywhere I go!  Hoorah!  Location will no longer stand in the way of being a total dork!  And my grandparents took me to pick out luggage, which was way too exciting(no sarcasm intended).  And yesterday, my other grandparents brought me a sewing machine of my very own!  It's 1950's sky blue and the coolest thing ever.

I have a sudden urge to learn everything that would make me the ultimate housewife.  I want to bake pies!  I want to make quilts!  And learn how to arrange flowers!  And lean which cleaning product can bust that grime!  And pop out baaabies!  And learn to have supper on the table by 6:30!  And power-walk!

And power-walk!"

"event","So, it's quite a good thing that I feel I draw best late late late at night.  Quite good indeed, because I have a feeling, due to the fact that I tend to have a BIT of a procrastinating nature and Pratt's heavy work load, this will be the first of many, MANY late nights of doing artwork.  Hoorah.

But, yeah, so I took a nap for an hour, from like 11:15 to 12:30 or so and now I'm up and at em'!

I'm quite pleased with my progress tonight.  I've only looked at the Diane Arbus book 3 times.  Talk about self-control!  I wish I could keep it.  I have high hopes for that book.  I think I would be a better person if I owned it.  Ha!  Look what a silly little fool I've become!  I am the ultimate consumer.  Beware. 

Tonight Sean met Ann and Paw-Paw and the awkwardness was definately a 10 out of 10. Ha! I had predicted a 5 to poor Sean beforehand, but I think we both knew it'd be a 10.  It was fuuuuuuunny.  I like watching him squirm."

Yesterday I went to Camera Exchange and asked the guy about medium format cameras and the guy looks all confused and says they mostly only carry digital now because that's what photography has become.

Excuse me?  You're telling me I'm too late?!  This isn't fair!  I feel like I just got into this wonderful world of medium formats and other exciting photography things and you're telling me, ""Oops, sorry, you missed out on that fad.""  

Goddamn you stupid digitalness.  I hate you.  I want to do it the old-fashioned way.  I hate you, computer-made art.  In my opinion, that's no art at all.  You make art.  Not the stupid computer.  I realize I may be being closed-minded, but I just don't care.  

If the future of photography is digital, so be it.  I'll just smuggle in the real stuff and sit in my backyard making cyanotypes all day long."

Today was Sean and I's 4-month anniversary and last night he took me to Riva's and it was oh-so-yummy and perfectly wonderful.  I love how completely comfortable I feel with him.  

So then today when I left school, it was starting to rain and I was thinking, ""Ugh this stinks"" when all of the sudden I look up and Sean is walking toward me with an umbrella!  What a splendid surprise!  He usually would be at work by now!  So he walks me to his car and told me to look inside for a surprise.  And there, in the seat, were yellow roses!  My favorite!  And a bag from 3 Brothers Bakery with 2 turtle cookies (one for Ali for a bday present) and 7 layer chocolate cake!  

Oh, and I got a $1000 scholarship for my art portfolio so the day was even better!

Thank you, darling, for an absolutely wonderful past 4 months, and for being my best friend.  I love you!"

There!  I said it!  All I ever want to do is scrapbook.  I feel like everything is right in the world when I scrapbook.  I feel like I have control.  I feel like I'm entering such a huge world, and I've only scratched the surface.  I lie in bed at night thinking of what wonderful scrapbook things I could buy.  I ponder stealing money (temporarily) from my sister to buy beautiful, beautiful scrapbook papers that are 50 cents each.  Hell, I don't even want to go to college anymore!  I want to devote every second of the rest of my life to scrapbooking.

And just before he got up to go, I brought out a warm piece of apple pie.  He's never looked so happy!  But, at the same time, in shock, because, you see, he's always said that the day I bake him a pie, is the day he asks me to marry him.  Whoopsies, Sean, you've gotten yourself in a pickle now, haven't you?!

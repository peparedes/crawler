What's up. It's 8:20 and I have a pitching lesson in 40 min so this prob wont be very long. I had a good and bad day today. The day was going really well until my last period. I went to get a note so that I could get out of class early for my softball game cuz i was starting pitching. Except the whole thing didnt' work out cuz of stupid Mr. Meyers and yea, then Ms. Miranda ended up holding us even later than class and I didn't get out until 3:10, urgh. Then i was hurrying as fast as I could and I saw matt walking down the hill and i told him to wait that I would change really fast, so I did...I changed in like less than a minute...then I came out and he wasn't there. I thought he left and I just felt like crap, i didn't really have time to go searching for him tho so I looked for him while I started walking down...I didn't see him. Then I got to the field and had to warm up my arm and Ill my pitches before the game started, I didn't get to warm up hitting or take any swings so I didn't get to bat at all during the game. Plus I was so flustered from being late and everything seeming to go wrong tha I don't think I was pitching my best. So that frustrated me too. In the end we ended up winning 3-1, but still. And now Lauren is back so I move down to JV tomorrow...so yeah I am both happy but sad about that. And yea...then I saw matt he had come down from his pract to see me and the coach gave me the game ball for pitching us to our first varsity victory. Then I went with Court and Erika to bible study , but on the way I listened to my voice mails and one was from matt saying what  did I think i was doing...he waited for me for 15 min and all this stuff... i felt really bad. then he left another one saying how he was really sorry about the message. And i can totally understand cuz that totally happens to me all the time wher I get mad at him cuz its my first instinct and then i feel bad about it. Bible study was fun except for the end when we kinda felt like a hastle, but court cleared that up a bit. Well, i wrote this whole thing in 10 min while watching the re-run episode of the OC that is on tonight, but now I should get going, feel free to respond to my good and bad day."

"event","Why does it always feel like i never have a break? No time to relax? I always feel like there is something i have or need to do. I always have homework it's so much, I can't wait until school is over. Then it's summer and hannah leaves and i feel like she doesn't care about me as much as her camp friends or whatever and i d k. We're best friends and then she leaves and while she's gone it's like ok so while i was ditching my other friends for her now i have none (even tho i do, and im not ditchin my friends but still i dont wanna lose her). Then I have softball and i feel like i have so much competition and have to work so hard. I have at least 7 different pitches and I have to work so hard to make each one perfect, make it have the right spin, the right location, the right speed. I have to work so hard and i need to work on fielding and batting all at the same time. It's like i have so much competition i cant beat out lauren its like im at this place wher ther is nothing i can do but try my best and it's still not good enough. I want softball to be my career come 2012 I want to be playing with team USA in the olympics I want to be pitching. Ive wanted that ever since I was a little girl and I feel like the people who are playing over me like lauren dont want it half as bad as me. Like she'd rather be playing basketball while I'm trying to fulfill my dream. And there really isn't anything I can do about it except what I am doing...try my best, practice, and work hard. Life is just so confusing, and tiring, and frustrating, and sometimes just makes you feel like giving up, but giving up doesn't accomplish anything. You have to work throught it and give it your best shot and at the end of the day know you worked or tried your hardest. That's the best you can do and that's all anybody can ask of you!"

"event","Hey Everyone I haven't written in here in awhile! It's been a pretty hectic week firday was the formal and that was tons of fun! I had a total blast it was amazing! There I found out that Matt, Mesha, and I all made sweetheart court! Iwas soooo excited! Then after formal Mesha and Hannah spent the night and then Sunday I left for Sacramento for school field trip! It was my first time on a train! yay(Annie...I'm not a virgin anymore! lol) ok yea and then I had tons of fun up there I mean who wouldn't a sleepover fieldtrip how awesome! I wanted to meet Arnold, but he wasn't there when we went to his office! ThenI came home late Monday night and had to wake up early Tuesday morning for the exit exam which i also took wednesday. Those things are the easiest tests I have ever taken. Then yesterday I had the sweetheart rally wher the king and queen were announced! I didn't win and that was really sad, but Mesha and matt won so i'm happy for them...well for matt...I feel like Mesha always wins everything over me and I always have to compete with her, but whatever I guess she's always gonna b better than me...and it'll always be like this,but what ever. Then we had our last soccer game and we lost 2-1 we totally were better then them though but thats ok we won in spirit! Except right in the beggining of the game I landed on my foot wrong and I heard it pop and it hurts like on the balls of my foot and the inside of the arch! I didn't say anything to my coach though cuz I wanted to play in the last game! Then I went to the bball game to watch Matt and Mesh get their awards even though it made me sadder matt wanted me there for him so I went. then I came home hung out with my fam and I have been relaxing in bed all day with my sore foot (which I can't really walk on now) taking a day off jus for myself with no school!"

"event","Hey everyone,
Things are going better. They aren't the best, but they are going better. Things with Matt and I are good. He got to come over last night so we could just hang out and talk. We had dinner and then we watched the Princess Bride! Very funny movie if I do say so myself. I think one of my favorite parts is when Princess Buttercup and Prince Humperdink are getting married and the guy marrying them has a lisp. I love when he says ""marriage"" and ""true, true love"" it's hilarious! so yeah...and I got to go to church this morning, and then I got to work with some of the cutest one and two year olds I've ever seen! I'm sooo excited to be working with the nursery now on Sundays. Then after church and the nursery I had softball ""practice"" or a clinic as they like to say because officially we aren't supposed to be practicing yet, but you can have clinics! Then after that I went to Erika's house for bible study! Yay! Haven't had one of those in a while, but I was glad we did! I'm glad that a certain someone there (u know who you are but ill leave you annonymous) I'm glad that they came upfront with the whole bible study and told us how she was feeling. I feel sorry for her, but all I can do is pray because I know that God has a plan for how he wants things to go, and hopefully the plan will be good. Well it has to be it's God's I just hope it goes the way that makes it easiest to deal with and I know that my friend will turn out okay. I just feel bad for her because as her best friends have left she may be losing her boyfriend too. I hope that everything goes well, and I want her to know that I am praying for her and I'm here for her if she ever wants to talk. Also I want her to remember that rainbow of promise that we both saw on our sad days and remember that with all the rain and gloominess that God brings eventually there will be sun and a beautiful rainbow of God's creations! Then after Bible study I went to Hannah's with Mesha and we worked on planning some top secret stuff for formal! It is going to be sooo awesome! I am so excited! Yay! Well I am in a better mood and I hope the rest of the week goes well for me and my friend!"

"event","Just so you all know lately I have not been having the best nights! I feel like everything is going wrong.  I know that God is here and I pray to him, but I feel kinda like he is letting it happen. I tried to write down how I was feeling last night and tonight in my journal and I am going to put those journal entries in here so that for those of you who care you get a little of what I'm feeling!

Dear Journal,                                                                  1/27/05
     Right now I feel really sad, but I don't really feel like writing it all down, but I am because Matt asked me to so he could read it later and know how I was feeling. I feel like I ave too many emotions/feelings to write down! There is just so much stuff to explain and I feel like I tell the story twice because I cry and I get it all out and then I have to write about it! I'd rather just tell the story while I cry so I get it it all done at once, but I can't cry and write so that doesn't work! And crying makes me tired so now I wanna sleep but if I lay down I wont get back up. O well I guess I'll just write it. Ok so let's start with my mom...my mom means a lot to me! She is one of my best friends, but lately well sometimes I feel like we really dont get along and it makes me upset. Like I'm really emotional now (and no I am not on my period) snf I'll go from being really happy with her to being really mad or upset with her. It's off and on though and I just wish it would always be ok but it's not. Also my sisters will get on my nerves all the time. Sometimes they don't even really do anything and I just overreact. I get really mad and I react in a way that I am not proud of. But right after I yell or whatever when I get in my room I cry because I feel really bad and I know I shouldn't act like that and I don't wanna act like that and I feel even worse if I've hurt them and I know it hurts when I yell at them or whatever. And it makes me sad because I know that God doesn't want me to act like that and I don't wanna act like that. I don't wanna grow up and yell at my kids and treat them like that, but I can't help it... I feel like I just naturally react like that but then I feel worse later. Plus on top of all of that Erika is moving to Arizona and I'm going to miss her soooooo much! I love her and it wont be the same without her. I feel bad for Kayla too because she shares my pain in this area and we feel even if we did get another bible study leader she could never take Erika's place. It's like if Erika was our mom and she and Court are getting divorced if anyone else came in they wouldn't be mom they'd be step mom and it wouldn't be the same. Worst of all though I feel bad for Courtney. Erika is really one of the last real best friends that She has here and now she is leaving. I know that Court is taking this really hard and what makes it even harder is that because she is my mentor and not my friend she can't even open up and tell me her problems. She could be taking this really hard for all I know and I'm worried about her. I want her to be able to share her feelings with me and know that I am here for her. Also I am really worried about her because she tries to act all strong and brave and give me courage, but I know that deep down inside she is hurting too. I'm worried about her because last night her away message was something like ""I wish God would take me now (and tonight hers is ""So if all of these trials, bring me closer to you, then I will go through the fire if you want me to.""-Ginny Owens)"". We don't want Erika to feel bad because this may be what God wants her to do and I know that it will be a good experience and opportunity for her so we have to let her go, but that doesn't mean we aren't gonna feel any better about it. Plus there is kinda stuff going on with Matt and me. We've never gotten in a fight and I don't feel like we are really fighting now just I don't know like I get upset or whatever. And I was really looking forward to seeing him! He came to support me and watch my game and all I did was ignore him! I didn't mean to but somehow I did, maybe I was just upset about the game but I'm not sure. All I know is that I hurt him. When i talked to him tonight he used a metaphore that really got to me he said ""I didn't even make him feel like the 5th wheel, I made him feel worse! The 5th wheel gets used but is ignored I made him feel like the spare tire that you don't pay attention to until you need it or it's always there that you can just fall back on"". That's what he said to me and it made me feel like such crap! I want to know how he feels but I'm sorry I hurt him. And then I feel bad that he's short on money, but he still wants to pay for me for formal and dinner and everything and he wont let me pay for myself. I  mean it's like I mean so much to him (he means a lot to me, that's not what I'm getting at) and I feel so bad when I treat him bad because he never treats me bad, and he always goes out of his way for me! Also, I get kinda jealous when he always gets to hang out with Taylor. I fell like Karen doesn't like me! I mean it's like she'll say that Matt can't do anything with me and then later I find out that he got to do something with Taylor. I feel like she likes him so much better and I'm jealous of him! I mean when Matt goes over the hill and he can't bring me but he get's to bring Taylor, or he can't come over, but he can do something with Taylor! I just get the feeling that she doesn't like me! I mean what am I supposed to think!?! I've never really said anything to Matt about it until tonight and he said that Karen does like me it's just (and this is what she had said when they were talking about it) ""that she know how it feels to be young and in love and who knows this could be the real thing, but if it's not she wants him to have other friends to fall back on"". That's why she tries so hard to get him to see Taylor. And then Matt starts saying that right now all he sees is me and Taylor. That he never sees Parker anymore, and he can't remember the last time he went to Steven's cuz it was so long ago, and the only time he seels Jon is when he shows up randomly at his house. And then that made me feel worse. I mean here I am jealous of the one friend that Matt really gets to hang out with other than me. I feel selfish. I mean I've always felt like I take Matt away from his friends, but he never said it was a problem. I always offered and asked for us to hang out wiht his friends, but he didn't want to. He made sacrifices for me. Here I am all concerned because I'm jealous that he has a friend that he likes and gets to hang out with! I feel bad because I'm selfish and I wanted him to myself, that if we ever did break up, he might not have as many friends, and that's because of me! And it makes me feel so bad and I think of how he always hangs out with me and my friends at school or whatever. He lets me hang out with them and he gives me my space and here I am being selfish because for once he wants to hang out with his friends. And i feel like I can never be as great to and for him as he is to and for me. And then friends remind me of Court again and how I feel so bad for her and I pray for her and I think about all of these things all of the time but I'm so confused and really sad!

Ok sorry that was long, but I had a lot on my mind and the next journal entry is shorter...

Dear Journal,                                                                 1/28/05
     Why do I feel like nothing is going right? I mean here I was the whole day excitingly anticipating for Matt to come over later tonight and we could just eat dinner, watch movies, cuddle, and finally talk, so I could get my feelings out. I cleaned downstairs for him and my room and I got things prepared. It was after his game and my mom went to the store to get stuff for dinner. No one else is home but me and I'm here waitng for Matt thinking maybe he could get here before anyone else got home so that me and him could have some alone time to talk. Everything is ready and still no one is home but me. Then the phone rings and I'm thinkink yay it's probably Matt calling to tell me he is on his way. So I answer the phone and it is him, but instead of him calling to confirm he was coming he had called to cancel. He said he went into his dad's room to ask him when they were leaving and his dad said they weren't that he wasn't coming over tonight. I was speechless, trying to keep my cry silent in the background as Matt kept talking saying that he asked his dad why but his dad said that he didn't want to talk to him and he didn't want to know. So now Matt or me don't know why he can't come over and he can't and I'm crying I'm not even hungry for the winner we were just going to have because it's just going to make me think of him and I'll cry because he's not there. All I wanted to do was be able to have a good time with him, cuddle, talk, get my feelings out, but no, instead I get to sit miserably at home missing him. I'm still all by myself crying in my bed, matt was gonna go home tonight from my house at 10, we would have had four hours together, but now we have none. I keep hoping that the phone will ring and it will be him saying that he can come. Or he'll show up at my house saying he wanted to surprise me. Something, snything I just want to see him. I can't even talk to him right now because after he told me he said he had to go and so i can't even talk to him right now. I need him. I know that I have God and that I can talk to him, but I want an actual hug, a comforting kiss, a reassuring voice, anything. I feel like it was all taken away in two seconds. God is letting this happen and all I can do is cry and pray. I hope that somehow someway he'll show up.

ok sorry that was sooooo long, but I had/have a lot on my mind. It's about 8:30 now and Matt isn't showing up, at least not tonight. I got to talk to him, but that's it. I miss him. I know God is here but I feel like he's letting this happen and lately I just feel sad. I cry and cry and I talk to Kayla, but I still feel crappy."

Head on over there.  That website is courtesy of Kevin, just like I said it would be.  There's not a whole lot of pictures up there yet, but I'm working on a roll of film downtown, so there should be more up soon.  The layout could change here in the coming weeks, but there's at least a skeleton of something we'd like to see, and there's some pictures up as well.

So head on over there and check it out!

"event","As of now, my idiocy to actually use livejournal to its potential is hampering the process of us getting any pictures posted anywhere.  The webhost that I was planning on using is really lame and wouldn't let me post pictures from afar like I needed to do.

So here's the plan.  We're gonna get Kevin to make us a website (since he knows the most html) and we will post all of the pictures there.  This journal will be used for uh...well I'm not sure yet.  But we'll find something to do with it.

Someone will let you know in the near future about our picture site.  I swear, it'll get done.  Promise.

"event","Granted, this is supposed to be a <i>picture</i> livejournal, but as of now, we're still tinkering around with it.  Right now, we have to get any pictures that we already have to a remote site so we can link to them to put them on the journal.

So, for those of you that have actually already stumbled upon this journal, give us a couple of weeks to figure it all out.  You'll get your picture goodness in good time.

"event","Omfg... I haven't been on here in for freaking ever!!! lol... sorry I mhaven't written in here since like, last year, I think? I don't know, w/e... Well, I'm really bored so I decided to get on here... yeah. I'm over at my Uncle John's and Aunt Amy's house right now... Not much to do, really. My cousins aren't clinging to my leg anymore, which is a good thing, I guess, but I kind of miss it. I kind of WANT Ashley to be clinging to my leg liek she always used to, but she hasn't been doing that lately. *sigh* *sob* *cry* *sniffle* *sigh* ugh...I don't know what else to say really... We're going over to my Grandma's house soon. To have ANOTHER dinner, since we've already eaten here... ugh... too full. And I've decided to stop eating as much as I used to. I'm not going to become anorexic or anything... I'm just going to eat less. I'm tired of being so freaking fat. All of my other friends are sticks and we're always talking about fat people and what-not and it makes me really uncomfortable considering I'm not exactly skinny myself. So... yeah. I'm hoping to be skinny before I become a freshman or w/e. Like, before high school. Andy's sitting next to me now... I'm having him hold papers in front of his face so that he can't read what I'm typing. And yet he moves them away ever so slowly thinking I'm not watching him. But I can type without looking you know... lol... w/e ... I just coaxed my litle cousin Ashley into leaving the room so I could continue typing, lol. She's so sweet. I love her. It's the one that I miss that doesn't cling onto my leg anymore, you know. I just talked abpout her a little ways up. Yeah. Andy's in the bathroom too so I don't have to worry about him either. Tonight I think I'm staying the night at my Aunt Joanne, Uncle Jean, and cousin David's house tonight, and my cousins Mitch and Jeanie are coming too. So it'll be k-ool. I love going over to David's place because 1. his house is huge and 2. the reason his house is huge is because he is one of the three parts of our family that are frickin rich... lol... so, yeah. It'll be fun!!! Well, I've g2g... Ashley's wanting to paly Solitare so I have to make this quick and everything else quick so she can get on... CYAS!!!

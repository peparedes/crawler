"event","Talk about three chords and the truth.  I don't think there are two verses in any other song that could put our situation into perspective.  


Him:

If I told you I'd been walking
Out in the dark night thinking
Would you take as truth this alcoholic's word
I can't change what's done is done
But I can tell you this
Not a day goes by that I
Don't curse myself and all my sins
And I need you to hold on to
While this part of me is dying
And though I haven't kicked the demons
That haunt me
I'm Trying

Her:

I want to believe you
Believe what's held you has freed you
And I hate these doubts
That keep on coming back
My parent's think I'm crazy
For staying here this long
But there's nothing more I want for us
Than to prove to them they're wrong
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to think you're lying
And though I haven't found the faith
That I need
I'm Trying"

Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too
I don't know which one's to blame
For almost putting out our flame
But for me it's not the thing for us to do

The way it was, the way we were
Baby, you and me is where it was at
And I want, I want us back

Girl, we've come too far
For us to give up on tomorrow
When we've shared so many good time yesterdays
If I know you like I think I do
I know that you don't want to lose
The me and you, I'm dying to save

The way it was, the way we were
Baby, you and me is where it was at
And I want, I want us back

I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want, I want
I want to feel your love all over me
Wrapped up in us is where I want to be
I want, I want us back

Lately I've been lonely
Lord knows I don't like that feeling
Anymore than you like feeling lonely too"

You know how in the movies when someone gets upset and walks off on their own, someone always follows them to see whats wrong, horseshit doesn't happen, you sit your ass whereever you go by your GD self til you decide i guess i'll go back in.  You know how when you are sitting there trying to drown your misery in alcohol, in the movies someone eitheir tells you to put it down it's not the answer or at least offer to buy you another.  In real life they stumble up to you and say hey man buy me a beer.  Fuck you.  But you know what, im good and damn tired of the world fucking with me, so from now on, if you ask me to be somewhere, i hope your not counting on me, cuz you might be disappointed when i don't show up and don't call.  If you have a problem, I hope you don't need someone to solve it for you because if no GD body can be there for me when i need help, then fuck them when they want mine.  I'm giving things 2 months to turn themselves around and if they don't then im moving to the beach and starting over where no one knows me, except maybe my brother, and everybody is gonna be aware of my ""fuck you"" attitude from the get go, like it or lump it."

"event","This past Sunday was one of the best days I have had in a long time.  I went and had a big dinner, then went and caught crawdads down in the creek.  After that I saddled up our horse, Beauregard, and took a long ride down by the water.  It was awesome, you get so tied up in all of the problems and bullshit of day to day life that you forget that the best things in life are the simple pleasures.  There is something about being up on a horse down by the water soaking up the last moments of summer that makes it impossible to be unhappy.  You can't do it, i'm pretty sure its a law.  I went three days this week without touching any alcohol and still have almost a whole pack of cigarettes left that I got on friday.  I'm about good and damn ready to pick my ass up off the floor, cuz im tired of being down there.

"event","Let me start this first sentence off by saying I have the utmost respect for the men and women in the United States military, I appreciate what they are doing, but the very thing that they are out there protecting is OUR RIGHT to say whatever we want about them. I am sick and tired of people in Washington accusing people of being terrorists and Anti-American just because they say something out of the way, don't support this war, or don't conform to every ridiculous word that comes out of Commander Fuckhead's mouth.

I was reading this article http://newsobserver.com/24hour/politics/story/2423027p-10716195c.html about Comedian Bill Maher's comments:

""Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., takes issue with remarks on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, first aired May 13, in which Maher points out the Army missed its recruiting goal by 42 percent in April.
""More people joined the Michael Jackson fan club,"" Maher said. ""We've done picked all the low-lying Lynndie England fruit, and now we need warm bodies.""

This Senator, actually has the nerve to say this on the record:
""I think it borders on treason,"" Bachus said. ""In treason, one definition is to undermine the effort or national security of our country.""

Webster's dictionary defines treason as:
1 : the betrayal of a trust : TREACHERY
2 : the offense of attempting by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance or to kill or personally injure the sovereign or the sovereign's family

Now perhaps what Bill Maher said was in poor taste, perhaps it upset people, and perhaps he should have thought about the backlash it would get from this fucked up politically correct society we live in today. But it WAS NOT treason by any stretch of the imagination. If you disagree, please look at the definition above that I provided, or even the shortened definition the Senator provided and please tell me how what Bill Maher said in anyway threatens National Security, or betrays anyone's trust. 

The Senator went on to say:
""I don't want (Maher) prosecuted,"" Bachus said. ""I want him off the air.""

Well sorry cocksucker, you don't get to make that call. If you want to invent a reason to get a show taken off of the air, figure out a way that reality shows are undermining National Security, because I would love to see them go. Perhaps Simon Cowell is an Iraqi spy."

"event","For all of you out there who know Nilly, you already know she is a gross gross little girl.  But you don't even know the half of it.  So we (Me, Henny, Deni, and Nilly) are at Benn Benn's Italian Restaurant on Friday night.  Dinner had almost concluded, when Nilly, who was sitting beside me picked up a large piece of bread.  Now I have to pause to let you know that at this particular restaurant, the bread is large and thinly sliced, then covered with butter and garlic, and placed in the oven just long enough for the butter and garlic to melt and soak into the bread.  Now back to the story at hand, at the end of dinner, this bitch is gonna pick up this piece of bread, fold it into a point, and no not eat it, but instead proceed to SUCK the butter and garlic from the bread.  She SUCKED the butter and garlic from the bread.  She FUCKING SUCKED the butter and garlic from the bread.  All the while making slurping noises.  It was quite possibly the most revolting thing I have ever seen her do.  And I have seen her with A1 sauce you guys, so that's saying a lot.  After she returned the uneaten, yet sucked dry piece of bread to the basket, she had a greasy ring around her mouth.  I kid you not that I told her she looked like someone who has just eaten hooker pussy.  SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GROSS you guys.  Just ask Deni, she'll tell you :)"

"event","The Credit Card industry is the biggest load of fucking bullshit I have ever experienced.  I mean they are royally ass raping me.  First off if my payment is even one day late, regardless of whether or not it is my fault or theirs I instantly get a $40 late fee.  Forty fucking dollars you guys.  I mean thats not a penalty fee, thats a fuck you we took you to the cleaners fee.  So here is my dilemma.  I go online to pay my credit card bill but they have decided to change the system by which you make payments, requiring me to sign up for a new username and password.  Which is frustrating but ok, I did it.  So then when I finally get logged in to make my payment it tells me that it is going to be 2 business days before my ""Payment service"" will be setup.  What fucking bullshit, so this means that it will be two fucking days before I can make my payment so that they can then require 3 business days to process my payment, so that they can tell me that my payment was late and charge me GD $40 fucking dollars.  So, I was like well surely I can call my credit card company and make a payment over the phone because in this day and age you can do that sort of thing and they offer it as a good customer service option.  So I call.  After pressing 3000 fucking buttons to get to speak to a freakin human being, I begin telling her my dilemma.  But oh wait, they need a routing number and can't use a bank card, and she felt ""obliged"" to tell me that there is a $15 processing fee to make a payment over the phone.  FIFTEEN dollars, they are charging me FIFTEEN dollars to pay my bill.  Never in the history of fucking mankind did I think I would see the day when you Had to PAY for the option to PAY your bill.  Thats blatant communism is what that is.  So I politely told the woman to go fuck herself and that I thought it was bullshit.  So now I am stuck, I am going to get stuck with a $40 late fee for a payment that should have been on time.  All because they decided to make improvements.  I will not pay the late fee, I will call them when I see it show up and tell them that they can fuck themselves all the way back to Havanna and that if they don't take it off, I will be switching credit card companies.  Not that a new credit card company won't try to fuck me to, but If people are just going to roughly have their way with me, i'm at least going to be a financial whore and be promiscuous.  Cuz i'll be damned if i'm going to be stuck in a monogamous credit card relationship where I keep getting fucked by the same person.  If I want to spend $40 to get fucked, I can use it on wine and dinner, but the idea of getting it sucked from my bank account like some vietnamese whore at a USO show, I can live without.  So quite frankly, I would like Bank of America to know that they (the entire corporation) can collectively kiss my white ass.  And if you see me on the news, perched on the roof of the Bank of America in Deleware with human heads on sticks in true Lord of the Flies style, you will know they didn't remove my late fee.  *Steps off of soap box in a huff*"

"event","Well, the  church burned down and no one knew  
what Penecost Baptist was gonna do  
the Sunday brimstom got so dadgum hot  
it burned up a church bus in the parkin' lot  

In a panic the reverend, Dr. White  
called up an ex-member than hadn't lived right  
he owned Joe's beer joint right across the fence  
it's the same Joe's he'd preached against  
he said I don't really want to be a hipocrit  
I got a Sunday school class about to have a fit
we're all excited about revival week  
and being moved by the spirit so to speak  
with all the souls we saved and the money we spent  
we thought God told us to sell that tent  
I got a famous evangilist supposed to come  
and done run out of chairs, will you loan us some?  
Joe says hell you can just use the whole dang place  
A9 on the jukebox ""Amazing Grace""  
I ain't supposed to be open cause of them blue laws  
but we'll open tonight if it's allright with y'all  
 
Preacher said well I reckon that'd be OK  
the good Lord works in mysterious ways  
I was gonna talk about Joshua, Judges and Ruth  
and I reckon I can do it from the DJ booth  
 
At the First Baptist Bar and Grill  
it's the only church in the bible belt that smells like a whisky still  
when the sinners finish one more round  
we'll have dinner on the ground  
and go inside and hell, pray we don't get killed  
 
The evangilist came with a well-dressed choir  
they showed up around happy hour  
looked around the joint and didn't take it real well  
said the White ministry has gone to hell  
Ms. Mills that taught youth Sunday school  
and two deacons in the back room shootin' pool  
were sharin' the Lord with a Jim Beam rep  
who was teachin' Ms. Mills some line dance steps  
 
Reverend White was readin' from the book of Luke  
to a tall, drunk trucker about to puke  
he had John 3:16 memorized  
tryin' to dry his ass out to get him baptised  
the evangilist yelled about the lights and the beer  
said White you can't save any souls in here  
this place ain't nothin' but a den of sin  
ain't the kind of place Baptists ought to be in  
 
Preacher said well we don't really need y'all here  
You didn't do a very good job last year  
Only saved one sinner, that's Todd McGuire's  
little S.O.B that set my church on fire  
Joe's beer joint has done been revived  
Only been here an hour and I done saved five.  
Sure it's got mirrors and a big dance floor  
but I finally found the flock God called me for.  
 
They're at the First Baptist Bar and Grill  
it's the only church in the bible belt that smells like a whisky still  
not a stained glass window anywhere in site,  
just a blood-stained floor and neon lights,  
and the communion wine in here is always chilled.  
 
We're here every Sunday; We're livin' large;  
The only church with a cover charge.  
And if you don't like our doctrine and think we ain't devout,  
we'll have our bouncer throw your butt out ...  
of the First Baptist Bar and Grill"

"event","I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind. I even object to the implication that I am wasting something valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen. As an admirer of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to reduce my time for enjoying it. At the back of the Daylight Saving scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves."

"event","Kids, I hate to break it to you, but the Easter Bunny isn't real.  I mean the idea of it may be cute and sweet and it may even fly in places like Rhode Island.  But come on people, if there ever WAS and Easter bunny with a plan to visit everyone in one night, trust me he never made it past Shelby, NC.  This is the most redneck, po-dunk, hillbilly town on the face of the planet, chocked full of about 30,000 dip spittin yokels who should never be allowed to own a slingshot but yet have an arsenal of shotguns and rifles just itching to blow something away.  Malnourished deer with down syndrome within the perimeter of a Shelby wildlife preserve wouldn't sway Cletus from making his yearly beef jerky.  A 6'5"" 250 lb gay rabbit doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell.  That fucker would be mounted on the wall of a single wide so fast it would make your head spin.  What's more is if one redneck had a 6'5"" 250 lb gay rabbit on his wall, all of the rednecks would want one, so a nuclear rabbit mutation facility would be opened, probably where the Bi-Lo used to be, to begin manufacturing super rabbits for people to kill and mount.  It would be front page news everyday, the fur industry would flourish, taxidermist would flock to the county, every restaurant in town would serve rabbit meat and they would probably decree a festival in it's honor.  And to top it all off, now that that Donkey fucker is out of jail, the hunting grounds would be his house of ill repute.  So come on, if you ever briefly considered the reality of the Easter Bunny, take a road trip to Shelby and you will truly understand why it could never be true.

(This story was inspired by the statement from a guy from the Broad River Greenway in which he said ""Gastonia is just so much more Redneck that Shelby is"")  Did the Easter Bunny tell you that?

"event","Remember my birthday party last year?  Well it's March, so only 3 more months, time to start planning.  I need everyones help in making this year's party even better than last year.  I think the Hen is going to let me have it by the pool again this year.  So how can you help you may ask?  Simple.  Show up in your bathing suit, bring beer, or liquor, or cigarettes and make sure I can't stand up by the end of the night (and also that I don't drown).  I'm definetly going to bring back the Vodka watermelon, you fuckers loved the hell out of that shit, it was gone before I had more than 1 slice.  That was a big watermelon you guys, seriously.  I ask now for your suggestions on making this years party even better than last year.  More people are definetly going to have to be invited, and more shennanigans are going to have to take place.  And if anyone sits in the driveway and blows a car horn for 15 minutes at 6am the following morning, they will be eliminated.  Seriously, I will walk out side and shove a broom stick directly through your radiator and a ballbat directly up your ass.  Send me ideas for the party, and tell Hen how much you love her for hosting it :)

P.S.  Deni, I fully expect you and brad there, I can't have my party without you guys :)"

"event","Well last night was painful.  Rick and I went to shoot pool at the little redneck biker bar in clover that I always go to.  Evening went fine, I shot pool, drank way to much beer, was able to make 2 incredibly hard trick shots on the first try to the amazement of the bar.  Well everything was fine until around 12:30 when Rob came to designated drive my drunk ass home.  Walking out to the car, my buddy Timmy, bless his stupid drunk heart, decided it would be funny to run up behind me and pick me up.  Well this may have been so, had he actually been able to hold me once he lifted me off of the ground.  But apparently I weigh too much for that to happen so instead, I fall from about 6 feet in the air directly to the asphalt in a shortsleeve shirt, and he trips and falls directly on top of me slamming me into aforementioned asphalt twice as hard.  Jumping up and grabbing my assumed broken leg and arm, and severly bleeding road rashed forearm, I proceeded to curse him for about 10 minutes until Rob got me into the car.  On the ride back I requested a cigarette and that should I bleed to death on the ride home that Rob could have everything I own, as long as he sent my family a ham.  He agreed.  It hurts you guys, seriously.  But I'm sure I'll be right back down there next week, like I always am.  Pool and $1 beer are my addictions, I can't stay away.  The beer just tastes so good and I'm so fucking good at pool.  I think maybe next time I see Timmy I'll run over him with my car, and then say oops, I didn't realize my car weighed that much :)"

"event","Hello, my name is Chad. I am suffering from rare and deadly diseases, severe lisdexia, mild to moderate schizophrenia, extreme bad luck, fear of being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and guilt for not forwarding out 50 billion fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, then that poor 6-year-old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the travelling freak show. 

Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and everyone you send ""his"" email to $1000? How stupid are you? ""Ooooh, looky-here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by every Playboy model in the magazine!"". What a bunch of bullshit. 

So basically, this message is a big FUCK YOU to all the people out there who have nothing better to do than to send me stupid chain mail forwards. Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing the chain which was started by the Romans in 5 A.D. and was brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower and if it makes it to the year 2005, it'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest continuous streak of blatant stupidity. 

If you're going to forward something, at least send me something mildly amusing. I've seen all the ""send this to 50 of your closest friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being"" forwards about 90,000 times. I don't care. Show a little intelligence and think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out forwards. Chances are it's your own unpopularity. 

The point being? If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you sexless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it's funny, send it on. Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, whose only savior is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end up like Miranda. Right? 

Now forward this to everyone you know. Otherwise, tomorrow morning your underwear will turn carnivorous and will consume your genitals."

"event","I would like to dedicate this Christmas song to all of my dearest friends (Henny (your my friend also dammit), Deni, Nilly, Lindsay) but this especially goes out to Deni, who has continued to stand behind me and be my support as well as inspiration for my annual christmas parody that you sick bastards know and love.  The previous one was a quick attempt to tide Deni over, but the following song, is the real deal, I put time and effort into this for you guys.  I love you guys, merry christmas hehe :)

Jolly old Saint Nicholas, 
Lean your ear this way! 
Don't you tell a single soul 
That some of our friends are gay; 
Christmas will be coming soon; 
Now, you fat old fuck
Please procure an abacus 
Just for Linds the Duck


When the clock is striking eight, 
When Henny's fast asleep, 
Down the chimney broad and black, 
With our shit you'll creep; 
Please be sure to wipe you face
Make it white again
Or you'll excite dear Nillifer
With your charcoal skin


Deni wants some whips and chains; 
Nilly wants a sex doll; 
Henny wants a dirty book; 
With pics by Andy Warhol; 
As for me, my superbrain 
Helps me deck the halls; 
If one thing's missing from my list, 
I'm cutting off your balls."

"event","A young girl was left alone at home for the first time with only her dog to protect her, she heard a bulletin on the radio about a Dangerous Lunatic that had escaped from a nearby asylum, she immediately locked all the doors and went to bed. A dripping sound from the bathroom made it difficult to fall asleep, she reached down under her bed to make sure her faithful dog was by her side, he replied by licking her hand enthusiastically. The next morning when she woke up and went to the bathroom room, she found her dog hanging from the shower nozzle, blood dripping from his torn throat, on the mirror written in blood were the words: ""People can lick, too!""


A young couple were parked under a tree on a dirt road one night. When the time came to go home, the car wouldn't start so the boy told the girl to lock the doors and he'd go for help. As time went by, the girl's nervousness about her situation grew worse, and by the time she started to hear a scraping noise on the top of the car she was terrified. The police found her the next day, as they took her away from the car they told her not to look back, but she did. Her boyfriend was hanging from a tree limb, his feet scraping the roof of the car.

A young coed was returning from a night out with her friends and she didn't want to disturb her sleeping roomate, so she crept into the room and found her way in the darkness, undressed and slid into bed. The next morning as she awoke and turned to say something to her friend, she saw her mangled body on the blood-soaked bed, and written in her roomate's blood on the wall were the words: ""AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU DIDN'T TURN ON THE LIGHT?""


A man and his wife were vacationing in Las Vegas and as they arrived in their room they found it was filled with an overpowering stench. They called the front desk to complain, and headed for the casinos for some late-night gambling while the problem was taken care of. When they returned to the room, the stench was replaced with the strong smell of chemical cleaners and deodorizers, annoyed but satisfied that it was better than before they went to bed. Early in the morning the smell had returned so strongly that it awakened them, the man called the manager and angrily demanded another room immediately. While his wife packed up their stuff the man ripped the sheets off the bed, where the smell seemed to be coming from. He found that the mattress had been cut open and a well-dressed corpse had been shoved inside. The couple were given a complimentary suite and free passes to the shows."

"event","Hello everyone, please take your seats.  Today we will be analyzing the sick and twisted mind of Mother Goose.

Hey diddle diddle
the cat and the fiddle
the cow jumped over the moon
The little dog laughed
to see such sport
and the dish
ran away with the spoon.

Anyone would say this is a simple innocent nursey rhyme, but not so.  It is actually gansta slang and I will thus break it down for you.  You see *Hey diddle diddle* is actually the street name for a one eyed pimp named Jerome, *The Cat* and *The Fiddle* are two ghetto drug runners named Maurice and Tysheka.  *The cow* as it is so put actually refers to Molanda who is an asian prostitute who thusly belongs to *Hey diddle diddle*.  *The little Dog* is Jeromes little brother named Kuriowa, he is a pimp in training.  *The dish* is a crack head named Shosheka, and the spoon is the crack pipe.




So now that you know those facts I will break down to you what this ""nursery rhyme"" is actually saying.

A snitch off the street is saying:

Hey Jerome, Maurice, Tysheka,
That Ho Molanda just split wit yaw money!

Kuriowa started laughing at their incompetence
and while they all glared at him
That crack head Shosheka split with they pipe


Our next nursery rhyme is baa, baa black sheep


Baa, baa, black sheep
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes, sir
Three bags full;
One for the master,
And one for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane.

*Baa Baa Black Sheep* is a loose young lady named Veronica in the town of Hillsdale.  The wool obviously refers to her pubic region.  *The Master* is her 2 o'clock client who is into bondage, *the dame* is her girlfriend*  and *the little boy down the lane* is the 15 year old who offered her $20 to turn him into a man.  So basically this nursery rhyme states the following:

Hey Veronica,
You passin out any of that pussy today?
Yes Sir, Yes Sir,
I gots three people im bangin dis evenin
Im fuckin Master Larry @ 2pm
Im munchin on Candy's rug at 5:15pm
and Im makin little Tommy Turner a man at a quarter til 7
So basically this sweet little nursery rhyme introduces in your childs life, Bondage, Homosexuality, and Pedophilia.  And you thought it was about a sheep.  Idiots.

Well thats all the time we have for today class, Next time we will examine the twisted writings such as Hickory Dickory Dock and the Itsy Bitsy Spider.

"event","Saturday began as any other saturday should, i got up went to work for old dude got off about two o' clock but then my friends that's when this particular saturday jumped off of the guided trail and went for a 12 hr. extreme sport slide down the mountainside.  I went over to Rob's to catch a ride up to Charlotte, as we had reserved two rooms at the City Center Marriott for an insane $39.99 associate rate versus the $185 a night normal price.  Upon arrival at the Marriott Rob and I go in an give our name to the receptionist.  Expecting a happy ""we are glad to see you Mr. Thomas here is your room key"" we instead got, your not booked here followed by further assholesims to which we were told to go to the little shitty marriott 2 blocks away because thats where they had booked us.  So we leave and go park down the block where I proceed to call and make reservations for big marriott and cancel reservations from small marriott.  After making the change we go back to big marriott walk in and make small bitchy lady feel like a dumbass telling her that she checked something wrong and she had better look at her system again.  Upon looking she found that now by some miracle we were in the system and began to apologize more than a lifelong sailor in a confessional.  So we arrive in our rooms and proceed to meet more people who had come along for boy's night out.  Rob in his ever present quest to get too drunk to stand decided we would live the evening in style by  procuring a limo for the evening, which we did at a reasonable $400 for 6pm-1am.  After leaving the hotel in said limo we meet our delightfully strange Egyptian driver Ario and then proceed to Bricks Pizza, where we go in and have a few quick beers and a delectable slice of pizza pie. After departing the pizza place we drive down to the ole Circle K, yes friends the Circle K in downtown charlotte in a limo to pick up a 6 pack of beer.  At this point the limo contains myself, Rob, Jon Cain, John, and Nick.  We drink the 6 pack on the 2 minute drive to the comedy zone, we enter the comedy zone, get seated and begin to order beers and liquor filled concoctions 3 and 4 at the time.  Rob at this point is getting rather smashed as am I, so during all three comedic appearances we get loud and yell and were singled out by each comic including police academy actor Bobcat Goldwait a.k.a. Zed.  After leaving the comedy zone in our limo we roll down the window and make fun of people not in the limo.  From here we go to the parking garage to drop John off as he was under the legal age for the rest of the evenings activities, and pick up craig.  Then it was off to Crush, where Ario had said he could get us in for free.  Arriving at Crush we exited the limo and were turned away because nick had on tennis shoes and apparently, tennis shoes are not aloud in such fine establishments as bars in uptown charlotte.  So from there we decided it would probably be best to go back to the Circle K, yes friends two trips in one night, where we proceeded to purchase a case of budlight and a 22 Oz. can of Colt 45 Schlitz Malt Liquor.  So while riding around charlotte we passed around the colt like a bong, while each drinking a bud light of our own.  Ario then tells us he can get us into the liquid lounge.  So upon arrival we have to argue with doorman for 10 minutes to get out of paying a $7 cover.  So we enter the lounge to find no one, absolutely no one other than us and lounge employees in the establishment.  So we decide to stay just long enough for one drink and a cigarette.  I ordered a screwdriver which apparently at this place means orange vodka because im 98% sure my breath was flammable for about 10 minutes after guzzling it.  So we all get split up and Jon Cain and myself go back out to the limo to wait, everyone else comes running out jumping in the limo about 5 minutes later, craig dropping two beers from his shirt sleeves proclaiming, I stole these for you man, and then pulling two glass ashtrays from his trousers claiming i stole these as well.  So from here we drove around charlotte finishing the case of beer, and giving Ario locations such as the giant UFO so that we could jump out and try to push it, and then to Ericson stadium where we jumped out to push the water ball, which my friends after we got back in the limo, Ario jumps out runs over and rolls over top of the ball.  Crazy Egyptians.  So then driving around again, Ario decides it's time to take these fellas to the Gentlemans club.  So we arrive at the Titty bar, for those of you not aware the Gentlemans club is in fact a titty bar, smallest tittys i have ever seen mind you but a titty bar none the less. I guess im just spoiled. (*Winks at Henny*)  So in the titty bar we decide it's time for Rob a birthday lap dance, so half naked girl comes over to rub her butt on his crotch to which he pulls dollars from the back of her G-string and places them in the front making it appear that he is paying her for her service.  Crazy strippers.  So after Rob and Ario have both had lap dances we depart and head back to the hotel.  Nick and I have to hold on to Rob to make it into the building, we made it into the elevator before Rob hits the floor, COLD.  When we got to the 15th floor we tried to pick him up to carry him to his room, however its hard to hold a heavy lad when you can barely stand up yourself, so we decided it was probably the best idea to drag him face down down the carpeted hall to his room, then pick him up and place him in the bed, where he then of course fell out and hit his head.  We all woke up the next morning, went down and had breakfast, coffee and tylenol and went home.  You see girls, this is what happens when you leave us to our own devices, we get into shit!  But oh man how we enjoy it :)"

"event","'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house

The Hen was a screaming, she just saw a mouse;

I wrapped up the presents in paper so blue,

""It better be tiffany's, or no sex for you!""

My plan was to nestle all snug in my bed,

But ""get me a hornsby"" i was warned, ""or your dead""

""Get it yourself, i need me a nap""

This outburst had earned me one firm chicken SLAP

Then out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

The hen hid under the blankets, ""SEE WHAT IS THE MATTER!""

Away to the window I flew with a gas

Due to threats of a shoe being shoved up my ass.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow

Gave the vision of trouble outside the window.

When, what to my stoner glazed eyes should appear,

But a beat up ford pinto, and a man with a beer,

The man all boozed up, so slow and shrill,

I knew who it was, ""Henny, it's Bill!""

More rapid than eagles his curses they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called out some names;

""Now, Dickhead! now, Douchebag! now, Prickface and Gimp!

On, Herpes! on Toe Rot! on, Dildo and Pimp!

Screamed the Hen ""What's he yelling, why's he holding that chain?""

""Henny call the police that fucker's insane""

Out wander Hen's mamma, with a misty in hand

""Whats all this commotion, OH MY GOD, that's my man!""

""Henny don't call the police, he'll calm down and be fine""

""Ok, but stop Chad, he is loading his 9""

He slaggered on up to the door like some ooze

Holding and nursing his bottle of booze

As I locked in the clip and pulled back the slide

He fell through the window, he fell on his side

He was dressed like a wino, bottles attached to each leg

He looked like the homeless, and smelled like a keg

A bundle of goodies he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

His eyes -- so glazed over! his slurred speech so merry!

His cheeks were like chipmunks, his nose like a cherry!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And the beer foam on his chin was as white as the snow;

The stump of a blunt he held tight in his teeth,

And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;

He had a stoned face and a big ole beer belly,

That shook, when he weezed like a bowlful of jelly.

""Where am i"" he said, ""this isn't the bar""

""You missed it by miles, go get back in your car""

Through the beer goggles he saw the gun to his head

""You've got til 5 asshole, im ready for bed""

He jumped up and staggered and ran out the door

Hen's mom ran out screaming ""I don't wanna be alone anymore""

So we locked up the deadbolt and headed to bed

""Im sleepy as fuck, you heard what i said?""

So i dreamed all the dreams that boys often do

About Hot girl on girl sex in the swimming pool

As my slumber deepened, I mumbled out right

Merry Christmas you all, and to all a GOOD NIGHT :)"

"event","Dear Santa Clause (if that is your real name),

If you can draw yourself away from spying on innocent children to see if they are being ""Naughty or Nice"" and from barking commands at mini legions of slave labor you call elves, (Which im pretty sure violates about 30 different State and Federal Laws by the way) then I would like to submit to you not your normal run of the mill ""Wish List"" but rather my list of demands!  You see late on the evening of November 27th while you were indulging in the gluttonous ritual you call Thanksgiving, I caught the redeye Delta Airline Deeply Discounted Coach Flight from Charlotte, NC to the North Pole.  Sure I had to make a 90 minute layover in GD Ohio, but I digress.  I arrived there under a heavy blanket of snow and darkness, which camoflaged me as I snuck into the sweat shop that you call the toy factory and KIDNAPPED your lead elf Franklin.  Franklin was then whisked away at gun point to an undisclosed location.  Thus unless you want him to meet an untimely demise you will meet not some but EVERY ONE of my demands you fat bastard.  To begin with, I want your sleigh, I plan on selling it's secrets to the CIA, i'm sure an aircraft that can travel far faster than the speed of light can make me billions.  Second, fork over the bag old man, with it's unlimited holding compacity technology, I will not only put every toy box maker out of business, but will also sell it to the military.  Think of it, entire armys could be taken overseas via a small one man life raft.  Third I want Rudolph, don't send him over singing Christmas Carols eitheir, i'm sending him to General Electric for scientific study.  Any glowing nose that can cut through fog will make me millions on the light bulb market.  Fourth, I want complete documentation on how you go down chimneys, enter homes with no chimneys, and succeed flawlessly in never setting off a burgular alarm.  This technology will go to the highest bidder be it the Department of Homeland Security or to the Gambino Crime Family.  Fifth, I want samples of whatever drug you are taking that holds the secret to your immortality.  This I intend to horde greedily to myself and live forever.  Seventh I want all deeds and titles to your executive mansion at the Pole, it's time you retired old man, seek residence in Florida.  Eighth, you WILL give me the secret to snow.  Weathermen around the globe will pay buckoos to be able to accuratley forecast blizzards.  Ninth, i want 20 of your elves to do my bidding, you have thousands, you can part with 20.  Finally, you will silently leak to the news media via the North Pole Press that Santa Clause was killed in a tragic snowboarding accident and that Christmas is cancelled until further notice.  You will change your name to Bob Winters and live out the rest of your days in a retirement home of your choice.  If you do not comply with every one of my demands by the 24th of December, I will mail Franklin back to you in 300 delicatly hand wrapped christmas packages, do we understand each other Cringle?  I will be in contact soon, any attempt to notify the authorities or play hero will result in Franklins removal from this world.  

Yours in Christ,

The Grinch"

"event","Henny is truly the luckiest chicken alive.  Her mother and sister are likewise lucky by association.  Let me elaborate on the reason why they are so lucky.  Last saturday I arrived at the Hen's house and spent two hours making the most GD damn hell fabulous meal known to man.  Imagine a hungry you sitting there thinking damn, i'm hungry then being able to parade your happy ass over to a table and sit down to this, 6 luscious beer/wine soaked specially spiced fire grilled chicken breasts, 25+ likewise wine/beer soaked, specially spiced fire grilled steak shishkabobs consisting of a rotating pattern of steak, mushroom,green pepper, onion, then casually returning back to steak.  Wow your thinking to yourself thats a lot of food, but it doesn't stop there no not by a long shot.  Add to this a plethora of finely cube shaped chopped potatoes seasoned, covered in butter, soaked in beer for flavor and then wrapped in aluminum foil to bake at a comfortable 350 degrees while basking in its own godly fermented juices.  Then you add 4 delectable cobs of corn grilled in their shucks  (hehe shucks) locking in the moisture.  Then dare we not forget about the very core of the meal, the best part, the nucleus of its existence.  My friends I bring to the table a bowl of the most succulent sauteed mushrooms and onions in a lightly seasoned butter sauce.  Then I even set the table and poured the drinks.  I do have to give special notice to the Hen however, she was a wonderful assistant who helped in making the bread, the brownies, and meating up the shishkabobs.  Thats right, I cooked her a feast fit for a queen.  Now for the rest of you out there, if your a girl go slap your man for not making you meals and treating you like royalty, if your single go get a man so you can slap him, and if your a guy, then Ha fucking Ha I'm better than you because girls like food, and I can cook up a table full of ""gonnagetlaidtonight a la mode"" and you can't. :-D"

"event","Today marks a triumphant day in my existence and I owe it all, every single solitary goddamn bit to Melissa Curtin.  She stepped up to the plate and provided me with something the rest of you peons failed miserably to do.  She gave me my very own LIVE JOURNAL code.  Now I am part of the truly elite and I did'nt have to sell out and pay the $5 like a sucker to get it.  Sucks to all of you who said I was whiny, bitchy, annoying etc. for wanting a free LJ code.  It is my right as an american to get a free blog on the internet, and not just any free blog, no I HAD a free blog but it was a sell out version, I was ashamed to be part of something with the word DIARY in the name of it.  But no longer now I officially have a journal.  I can be added to friends list, i can HAVE a friends list.  Paying for this service however is UN american and would make me an afghani towel head.  So again in conclusion, sucks to you all, Melissa is my hero from this day forth, so if she ever takes over the world or something coo, you better hope she likes YOU because I formally relinquish myself to be her Evil Minion when such a time arrives.  Be afraid be very afraid.  HOORAY MELISSA!"

"event","House of the Dead...New Movie, Based on a Semi-Decent game. Hmm half naked girls, blowing up zombies, while ""Ya'll gonna make me lose my mind"" plays in the background. It's not a blockbuster obviously, but it at least looks like it would be worthy of a Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street Era 80's horror flick award. So off we go to the movie theater to embark upon the journey that is House of the Dead, and now sitting here 24 hours later, I am planning on suing the Motion Picture Association of America, for 2 hrs of my life back. If some old lady can sue McDonalds because she spilled coffee on herself because she didn't know it was hot, the MPAA will damn hell give me those two hours back, and if all goes according to plan, and extra hour and fifteen minutes toward the next stupid movie they let pass through the cracks. Anyway, I digress. Allow me to list some of the reasons this movie will make you want to stand in front of one of the Matrix style fired firearms.

1.) Dude gives a fisherman $1000 to take them to an island that they have just been warned contains evil spirits
2.) Dude vomits directly on a girls face, to which she just giggles and says eww. This turns out to be just an irrelevant reason for her to take her shirt off. Now don't get me wrong, I love a nice boobie shot as much as the next guy, but her skeeter bites made me want to slap her with her vomit ridden Hello Kitty Shirt.
3.)Girl goes into a building that all that has a sign on it that says Threshold to Hell. Idiot
4.)In classic pre-death sex scene, guy tells girl that they are gonna do the ""Humpity Bumpity, the right before insertion, decides he has to go piss. Its like dumbass, you coulda got layed but you opted to die.
5.) Chinese girl in full length red white and blue leotard whose name is LIBERTY. I swear to god you guys.
6.)BY pure fate the crazy fisherman just happened to have a crate full of Zombie killin weapons aboard.
7.) After Class 3 weapons have been passed out among the highscool children who are likely pushing IQ's of 45, the question is asked ""does everyone know how to use their weapons?"" Of course. Idiots.
8.) Dude kicks a ""dead"" zombie to be a badass in front of his pussy, at which point the zombie vomits on him and it eats his face
9.) People deciding they should make out while 10 feet away Zombies eat their friends.
10.)After seeing close to 40,000 reanimated corpses walking around, everyone of which has come back evil as hell, dude decides its a good idea to reanimate his dead girlfriend and take her back home with him. I hope she turns zombie mid blowjob, bites of his penis and then vomits it back up onto his face, and for the rest of his days he is known as nasty melty penis face boy.

In conclusion the Hen and I have done all of you a service, we have seen this horrid movie so that the rest of you will never have too. Run fast, run far, run away from it you guys, SERIOUSLY. Hooray Chickens :-D"

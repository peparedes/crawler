I have an RSS reader, and I try to keep up with all my friends blogs (often by reading a months worth of blogs in one or two sittings). Today, suddenly, unexpectedly, I was able to read any and all livejournal blogs. This is a surprise because livejournal has been blocked in China since last September, but suddenly it is unblocked. During this long period of blocked-ness, I started a new blog, thinking I would never again see this blog. My new blog is located at:

"event","Wow it has been a long time since I have posted an entry, but I do indeed have many good excuses for being far away from cyber-space for these last few months. For one, I was preparing for my wedding and getting everything ready in our new home. Thereafter occurred said wedding (July 12th). Which, by the way, was the greatest day of my life (pictures to come... eventually... though some people who attended the wedding have already posted some photos on facebook that you can hunt down on facebook under the 'photos of javad taken by others' section). After this was Lily and I's 'honeymoon', two weeks of traveling together with mom, dad, brother, aunt, and uncle, which certainly isn't your traditional honeymoon, but it was nice to spend so much time with the family after not seeing them for such a long time, and it was a great way for Lily to get to know my family more deeply (and visa versa). Then we all ended up back in Guangzhou (after Lily and I did get a couple of days alone in the beautiful paradise that is Yangshuo, China), where we helped my parents get settled in to their new apartment and new life in their new city. And now, I'm back in Macau, waiting for my passport to re-accompany me once it returns from it's current trip to a Chinese embassy in the US, where it is kindly obtaining my work visa for me. I'll be here for about 2 more weeks then will be returning to my wonderful wife and our life of all that is to come."

"event","1) I am moving to Lijiang on Friday! My new home, the place where I will get married (on July 12th), raise a family, and live most of my life. I am exuberant!

2) I will be married in 5 weeks!!!!!! (www.geocities.com/eyeoflayman)

3) I am now officially enrolled in an online 'Masters in Adult Learning & Global Change' through Linkoping University in Sweden (program is run in collaboration with professors from U of British Columbia, a university in South Africe, and another university in Australia). It really looks like an awesome program. And if I haven't mentioned before, it is free, because Sweden rocks and finds ""higher"" education important enough to make it accessible for everyone (I put ""higher"" in quotes because a degree does not necessarily bring one's knowledge ""higher"". I don't like the common term ""higher"" education).

4) One month from today my mom, dad, bro, aunt, and uncle all arrive in China! My aunt and uncle will be here for about 3 weeks, and my mom, dad, and bro are here for, perhaps, ever. 

5) I just signed a contract to teach English at the University of Yunnan in Lijiang starting in September. 

6) I always right about ""I"" on this blog. This needs to change. Eventually I'm gonna be getting a new website for 'Intrinsic Cadence' up and running (first I wanna finish the CD), and I'm gonna get a proper blog on there too I think, and update it with more exciting stuff then simply life's headlines. I like to update you all on life's happenings, but I feel I could get more out of the whole blog experience if I strove to infuse some creative juices into it. Maybe mention the headlines too, but go through more of the internal journeys, etc. Strive to paint more vivid pictures of moments in time and the effect it has on life's spiritual quest, etc. Cuz we've all got all sorts of spiritual pictures etched into the depths of our souls, and the blog-sphere is another one of the many realms of expression in which these pictures can burst from their canvas and become more then an idle image imprinted internally.

"event","1) I can't wait to move to Lijiang! It'll be really soon!!! (more to come...)

2) I'm getting married in less than 2 months!!!!!!!!

3) Anyone know a good web space provider that I should look into. I've been working on making a website for Intrinsic Cadence (probably will be finishing it up right around the time I'm finished with the first CD!). I want to get a something that is inexpensive, but reliable and with plenty of bandwidth and total space. 

4) I now know that on May 29th I'll know whether or not I got accepted to the Master's program I applied for (online program through Linkoping University (in Sweden) called 'Master's in Adult Education and Global Change')

5) I'm getting married in less than 2 months!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6) A year ago the exchange rate from Macau's Patacas into China's Renminbi was almost 1=1. Now, when I exchange 4,000 Patacas I only get 3,500 Renminbi. This ain't cool, since I have to exchange all my money into Renminbi soon. 

7) On May 20th, Lily and I will pay the last portion of the money to the previous owner of the apartment we bought. This means that on May 20th, they will also move out and we can begin to move in anytime after that. This means that as soon as I get to Lijiang I'll be able to move into the new apartment (Lily will remain where she is until after the wedding, then she'll move on over). 

8) We found the person who will replace me as the Project Officer for the Badi Foundation's Junior Youth Empowerment Project (JYEP)! He'll come in August. Some of you Chicago people may know him.

9) One of the schools the JYEP has been working with has decided they want us to run a summer program with their school this summer! We were able to find someone to run the program (since I'll be leaving), and everything is pretty much set up with that. It's really nice to know that we will be able to continue on with this school into the future. This was the first school the project began working with when the project first started last year.  

10) When I go to Lijiang, I'll have about a month before the wedding to prepare clothing, prepare apartment, prepare self, etc. I'm also looking into the possibility of teaching English online for 6-7 hours per week in order to have a little bit of money coming in, since this summer will cost a decent amount of money. 

11) I'll be signing a contract quite soon to teach English at the University of Yunnan in Lijiang. 

12) I am looking forward to sitting down sometime and having a real nice reflection on the past year of my life. It has been just over one year since I first arrived in Macau, and there are a lot of experiences that have changed the whole direction of my life's path. I've always felt day-to-day reflection on one's life is the most important, but year-by-year reflection is also a really important thing in order to get a more wide picture for how one is progressing.

13) I'm so excited that my parents are moving to China! It'll be really nice to have them nearer. 

14) It's almost 3 am, I really should go to bed. Good night..."

"event","Time seems to be moving at a snails pace as I await to leave Macau to move to Lijiang, where my fiancee lives and where we'll be living for many years into the future. It's likely I'll be moving there sometime in June, with just enough time to finish up preparations for the wedding (July 12th), but as far as I'm concerned I'm ready to be there now. 

As the end of the school year gradually approaches, the schools I've been working with have begun to block off their extra curricular and elective class-time solely for the purpose of preparing the students for their year end exams. As such, the junior youth sessions at one of the two schools the Badi Foundation's Junior Youth Empowerment Project has been working with have ended for the semester, and the other school has just a month left, then we'll be done there. As one school wraps up and the other school comes towards an end for the semester, I feel an even deeper yearning to move to Lijiang. It feels like things are wrapping up in Macau and I feel a natural internal pull pulling me towards Lijiang. That pull has been there for quite a while, but now that things are in the wrap-up stage, and since it has been 2 months since I saw Lily last, I feel an even deeper pull.

The specific time when I'll be leaving to move to Lijiang is still up in the air, for the time being. We are waiting to here back from two schools that we have talked to about the possibility of doing a summer program collaboration with. If we are able to arrange something to work with one or two of these schools, then I will be staying until around the end of June so that I can get everything prepared so that my job replacement can swing on in and take over the project in a way that keeps it flowing without any major obstacles impeding it's progress. If, on the other hand, we are not able to arrange something for the summer session, then perhaps I'll move to Lijiang in late May or early June. It's uncertain when we will know for sure, but I'm really hoping we'll get a more clear picture within the next couple of weeks (especially because the timing of my job replacements arrival in Macau is largely determined by whether or not he needs to be here during the summer, if there is no summer session he'll probably come in August, if there is a summer session he'll probably come sometime in June).

I'm tellin ya, I wanna be in Lijiang with Lily with all that I am..."

"event","Okay, the beginning of this entry may sound a bit like an advertisement, but when I discover that Swedish universities are free for everyone, no matter where in the world you are from, I feel a need to spread some information about it.

Anyone wanting to continue their formal eduction should seriously look into the university programmes offered by Swedish universities. Sweden spends a lot of their GDP on education, and has created a system of higher education that is FREE for everyone. Bachelors, Master, PhD, all free, and as far as I can tell they have some really great programmes. They even have a few programmes that are distanced-learning degree programs. I'm applying for one, it's a Masters in Adult Education and Global Change from Linkoping University. It's a two-year part time program that never requires me to actually go to Sweden, I could do it all from China, and it won't cost me a dollar. The focus of this degree is really great, it is focused on enhancing the learning environment in various settings (workplace, school, etc) and aiding in a process of creating unity among people from different cultural backgrounds. A lot of this is done within the realm of adult education. There are a few other online programmes you should look into if you, like me, would like to get a Masters degree but don't want to fork out the ridiculous tuition fees of US universities. In my searching, I found the following online degrees offered by Swedish universities (all free, though a couple of them may require you go to Sweden once or twice for a week or two): Masters of Business Administration, Masters of Social Anthropology, Masters of Child Studies, Masters of Adult Education and Global Change, Masters of African Literature, Masters of Linguistics. If you don't want a degree, many Swedish universities also offer single courses for free in a variety of subjects. 

And to finish off the blog entry, here is the short essay I just wrote for my application to the distanced learning Masters programme at Linkoping Univeristy I've applied to:

        When reflecting on the present state of the world and the path along which history has traveled to arrive at this moment, it becomes evident that humanity is in dire need of true unity and of a deeper understanding of the beauty of the cultural diversity that exists on our planet. In order for society to advance we all need to learn how to build bonds of trust and respect that transcend cultural boundaries and national borders. If we learn to see ourselves as citizens of a global community who are intimately interconnected with all the dwellers of the earth, we can begin to become active participants in the continually unfolding process of community and global progress that is propelling humanity forward into never before explored territories of human development. Then, as we arise to take actions aimed at building an ever-advancing civilization, the new learnings we generate through our efforts can help us to construct a systematically evolving conceptual framework that will determine the nature of what our next endeavors will be.  One of the key elements we must each learn, then, is how to always remain in a learning mode.  This is one of the main reasons I would like to participate in the Intercontinental Master's Programme in Adult Learning and Global Change. I want to enhance my ability to learn how to learn within the various contexts of my life's path. 
	I am also very excited that the framework of this programme is largely centered around adult education. I have spent the last few years trying to help junior youth and youth develop their intellectual capabilities and their desire to be of service to their local community, while at the same time I have been going through processes of reflection and study with their teachers in order to create a learning environment that promotes organic growth and mutual development. I have often times felt that when working with junior youth and youth, they are naturally eager to develop capabilities that are related to the growth of themselves as individuals, as well as with the progress of their community. However, I have often times felt that the teachers and adults I have worked with are more rigid in their perspectives of the purpose of education, and trying to tap into their desire to improve themselves and society is not nearly as easy as it is with junior youth and youth.  Therefore, I feel like learning how to work more effectively with teachers and other adults would also greatly enhance my ability to be a more effective educator of every age level. I feel like in order to truly make progress within the realm of education and learning, whether it be within a school environment or in other settings, there should be just as much focus put into the growth and progress of teachers as their should be put into the growth and progress of the students. I feel that this Intercontinental Master's Programme in Adult Learning and Global Change will help me learn how I may be able to contribute to the growth of teachers, thereby leading to the growth of students, thereby adding a rung to the ladder leading to the development of an ever-advancing civilization."

"event","""What?! Javad, you own an apartment?! Seriously?!""

Yep, Lily just signed the contract Friday night. It's true, I don't actually live in Lijiang yet (I'll be moving there around June; Lily and I will get married on July 12th (p.s. if somehow I missed sending you information about that, you are invited, everyone is invited, go to www.geocities.com/eyeoflayman to see our wedding website)). 

Actually Lily and I will be half-owners of this apartment. My parents (who are moving to China in July!) decided to invest in half of the apartment since they will likely be living with us about 2 months per year (plus they want to spread out any financial investments they make for retirement into a few different places, so this apartment is a good place for them to do that). Since we bought this apartment not just for Lily and I only, we got a large apartment. It is 4 bedroom (1 for Lily and I once we are married, 1 for my parents, 1 for my brother, 1 as a study/office/prayer room/recording studio/guest bedroom), 140 square meters (~1,500 square feet), 2 bathrooms (and the one that is connected to Lily and I's future bedroom already has a sit-down western style toilet in it!), 3 enclosed balconies (enclosed balconies are common in Chinese apartment, it is usually used to hang clothes to dry; we plan on using one of them to have a nice little indoor potted planet garden to grow some herbs, and hopefully some fruits and/or veggies)(and one of these enclosed balconies is connected with the bedroom that will be Lily and I's!), 1 kitchen (good size), 1 living room (quite large), 1 dining room (good size), and a gorgeous view of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain (with no buildings blocking the view!). The location is prime, right in the center of the city, easy access to anywhere from here. All in all it seems to be the perfect place, which is why we bought it now instead of waiting until closer to July when we will be getting married. 

Another thing that I really love is the cost. Lily and I (who half-own the apartment) pay about the same as someone from the States would pay for a relatively inexpensive new Nissan car, but instead of 4 wheels we get 4 bedrooms. 

Now, picture time: (or go here- http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=17197&l=a0f38&id=505602608)

NOTE: None of the stuff in the house is ours, the furniture and everything is all the previous owner's

This is the view from one the bedrooms in the apartment. Yep, that is Jade Dragon Snow Mountain you see clearly without any buildings blocking the view.

There's hidden sweetness in the stomach's emptiness.
We are lutes, no more, no less. If the soundbox
is stuffed full of anything, no music.
If the brain and belly are burning clean
with fasting, every moment a new song comes out of the fire.
The fog clears, and new energy makes you
run up the steps in front of you.
Be emptier and cry like reed instruments cry.
Emptier, write secrets with the reed pen.
When you're full of food and drink, Satan sits
where your spirit should, an ugly metal statue
in place of the Kaaba. When you fast,
good habits gather like friends who want to help.
Fasting is Solomon's ring. Don't give it
to some illusion and lose your power,
but even if you have, if you've lost all will and control,
they come back when you fast, like soldiers appearing
out of the ground, pennants flying above them.
A table descends to your tents,
Jesus' table.
Expect to see it, when you fast, this table
spread with other food, better than the broth of cabbages.

My family is moving to China!!!!!!!!!
My dad just recently shook hands and accepted a job at an international school in Guangzhou, China! My mom, dad, and brother will be moving to China in July or August! 

I am so happy! And they are so happy! And it is so good! China is really good for them. When they lived in China for 5 years from 1998-2003, it was the happiest and most spiritually uplifted I had ever seen them. I am so excited for them to come back here and for that spirit of joyfulness that China seems to rub onto people rubs onto them. This may, possibly, be the move that keeps my parents in China for the rest of their lives. The hope is that after working at this international school for a few years, where my parents will be able to save up a decent amount of money (international schools pay US wages, but there are no taxes taken out and the cost of living in China is significantly cheaper than the US), then after a couple of years there they plan on moving to Lijiang (where I'll be for most of the rest of my life). Wonderful indeed..."

"event","Much has happened since the last time my last entry a month ago. Here are some of the highlights (I wish I had some photos to accompany the highlights, but unfortunately my camera seems to have decided to take a vacation from working for the time being).
On the last set of headlines I wrote on a livejournal entry about, we had made our way up to what had happened until January 11th. So let us start from the following day:

January 12- January 20: Javad is in Macau, doing his thing in the place he currently resides

January 21: Travel to Lijiang!

January 22- January 30: I participate in a<a href=""http://www.badi-foundation.org""> Badi Foundation</a> training session in Lijiang. We studied materials related to consultation, collaborating with like-minded organizations, developing human resources, and other things that helped my understanding of development develop. It was a wonderful training session that I gained a lot from.

January 31: I spend the day wandering around Lijiang with some of his friends who came here for the training session and will be returning to their various homesteads shortly.

February 1- 4: This time, leading up to the Chinese New Year, was largely spent cleaning Lily's family's house. The time just before the Chinese New Year is often a time to do the 'spring cleaning' and get the house beautified to begin the new year fresh. During this time I also had some time to do a few job-related things, such as write up a reflection report to submit to one of the schools I work with. 

February 5: Eat food seemingly all day.

February 6- 15: Remain in Lijiang. Do various things. Sometimes do job-related things, sometimes read (I finished reading ""Memories of Nine Years in Akka"", an AMAZING book!), sometimes eat, sometimes walk, sometimes sleep, sometimes cook... in summary: life. There was one day that consisted of some very memorable and important happenings........

February 13: This memorable and important day is the day Lily and I received our official consent for marriage from her parents. We got this consent in the traditional Naxi way. In order to ask for consent in the Naxi culture, I went to the store and bought four large blocks of brown sugar, two large bags of good quality rice, four different kinds of high quality tea, and four different kinds of high quality cooking oil. I brought all of these in a large basket to her family's house, and also brought along my ""family"" (since my actual family is in the US, I brought along some of my Lijiang friends to be my 'family'). The next step is that one of my family members was to casually bring up the topic of marriage while we are all sitting around talking. From here, since Lily's mother and father approved of our marriage, we commenced to begin consulting about our future goals and plans. It all went off without a hitch (translation= it was all good). 

February 15: Go to Dali (a beautiful city about 3.5 hours away from Lijiang) to visit Lily's aunt and uncle. We spent one night in Dali. 

February 16: Lily goes back to Lijiang. I go to Kunming, where I have a plane ticket for the following day to return to Macau. I stay in Kunming one night.

February 17: I fly back to Macau. I am sad to leave the Lijiang area, but I am happy when I realize that the next time I return to Lijiang will most likely be when I am moving there for the long-term. I can't wait for that time!!! I am so ready to move there!"

"event","Sit back, put your feet up, and get ready to learn some cultural anthropology. I've been reading a lot about the Naxi culture recently, and thought I would share some of the wonderful knowledge I have been gleaning from what I've been reading. The Naxi is a tribe from the southwest corner of China (in Yunnan province). Here is some information about them:

- <b>Population</b>: ~300,000
- <b>Location of tribe</b>: Lijiang city, Yunnan province, China country
- <b>Written Language</b>: The Naxi written language is the only hieroglyphic/pictorial written language still used today. 
<img src=""http://www.yfao.gov.cn/UpLoadFile/2007/09/26/200792611273371.jpg""/>
- <b>Religion</b>: The Naxi's traditionally believed in a religion called Dongba, which had a strong belief in life after death and was largely centered around the worship of Nature. The Naxi written language was created to write the original Dongba scriptures some 1,000 years ago. 
- <b>Cultural Roots</b>: It is believed that the Naxi are descended from a nomadic Tibetan ethnic group (who may have actually originally been descended from a group of Mongolian nomads; who may possibly have been some of the same nomads who came over the the land bridge between Russia and Alaska thousands of years ago who are now the Native Americans)
- <b>Music and Art</b>: One of my favorite things about the Naxi culture is their love for music and art. They especially love singing and dancing. One common form of singing is a kind of freestyle singing, where there is a constant melody and rhythm pattern but the words are improvised by the singer (I love listening to 80 year old women free-styling). The Naxi also have some traditional music that has a sound not dissimilar from some Native American music.
- <b>Clothing</b>: To this day most Naxi women over ~50 years old still wear the traditional style clothing. 
<img src=""http://img2.travelblog.org/Photos/3812/28747/t/142506-Traditional-Clothing-0.jpg"" />
- <b>Family Structure</b>: The Naxi are traditionally a matriarchal society. In the spoken language, when the word for female is added to a noun the word has larger meaning, when the word for male is added to a noun the word has a smaller meaning. The female is traditionally the one who does pretty much everything in the family, from cooking and cleaning to making the decisions to raising the children to carrying heavy items, etc. The men traditionally didn't do much, except sit around drinking and playing mah-jong. The family unit is very important in the Naxi culture, and it is not uncommon for large extended families to live together under the same roof, or at least in the same village.

Hope this inspires you to come visit me in Lijiang someday (once I move there in April, May, or June) and become acquainted with the wonderful world of Naxi."

"event","I have really not been very motivated to accomplish my tasks and goals over the past week or two. It is time for me to unmotivate myself from my unmotivation; to motivate my motivation. Over the past few days I have been riding on waves of laziness, and for whatever reason, have been content with remaining on them. Today, the waves are breaking on the shores of change, and I have thus far been holding strong to motivated ways. Luckily, for the next few days I have things on my schedule that should continue to give me a boost to get back into my normal motivated state of being. 

You know, as I am reflecting here, it isn't even that I have been consistently unmotivated for the past week or two, it is more like whenever I don't have time structured for specific purposes I have been unmotivated to do much, but when I have had time structured for specific purposes, I think I have been motivated enough to strive for excellence. But only when the time calls for me to do such. If the time doesn't feel like it is calling me to be such, then I fade back and ride the waves a bit. Dang waves."

"event","(Fingers snap)""and go...""
I thought perhaps this 'snap' could begin a stream of words that would be motivated by a desire to express something that is relevant to something. As I get one sentence into the writing process I begin to reflect on what it is I would like to say, should I try to make it simple, or perhaps thoughtful and reflective, or perhaps a meditation on life and all therein. Or perhaps I won't aim at such a specific mood, because if I have such an expectation for what I'm going to write, maybe if I hold on too tightly to what I think I should write about, I will actually be masking the deeper down in heart feelings and thoughts. Maybe. Or maybe brainstorming and having a concrete theme before beginning to write actually is a good idea because it gives an initial framework that I can then write within, and if I have that initial framework perhaps it'll be a nice jumping off place for my thoughts and ideas, and in turn what I write will actually be more interesting and thought provoking. I don't know, perhaps writing using the direct to-the-point method is the best, or perhaps writing using the indirect seeking-for-the-point method is best, or perhaps they can both be best when used in the proper context. It's like having a conversation with someone about the importance of justice and being of service to humanity to help it progress. On the one hand I could express very directly to someone that I believe it is everyone's obligation to be of service to humanity and to always seek for true justice, or I could indirectly ask lots of elicitation questions and try to guide the conversation towards this same idea. One is direct, the other is indirect. Both could be good in the proper context. So, in this blog entry I have chosen the indirect method, but the difference between this indirect method and the indirect method I gave an example of above is that in this version of indirect method I am indirectly driving at no particular point with no particular goal and no particular purpose. I am simply going in a direction, driven solely by what keyboard keys my fingers happen to press. No turning back and changing what has already happened, although I could learn from what has already happened and could use that learning to progress to what has not yet come, and then perhaps what will be written next will be better and more meaningful then what came before it. In any case, whether or not the next words will be full of wisdom or will instead be a relatively meaningless void is a mute point because I am not going to write any more words in this blog entry because I have to get going... THE END

"event","How do you establish a habit?
At different times in my life it hasn't been too hard for me to get rid of unhealthy habits, and for certain habits (daily prayer, eating, sleeping, etc) it has also been quite easy to establish daily routines (even if not always done at the same time as the day before, they are still always done everyday). However, I seem to be having trouble bringing in other daily habits, things that would be useful and beneficial to me if I could do them everyday, but things that aren't necessarily essential to my day-to-day well-being. 

These are habits I am trying to establish:
1) Study Chinese everyday
2) Do yoga or other form of exercise almost everyday
3) Have my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)"">spirolina</a> supplements twice per day
4) Going to bed before 1 am and waking up before 9 am (ideally sleeping from like 11 to 7 most days)

I am not meeting my goals in establishing these habits, and I'm not quite sure why. I have a theory that it is because my mind perceives that my stay in Macau is very temporary and thus rebels against establishing any sort of routine, since I am really quite eager to leave Macau and move to Lijiang. I think perhaps subconsciously I feel that establishing a routine means I am settling into living here in Macau, but my whole being resonates a profound yearning to move to Lijiang. 

I think for the rest of the time I do live in Macau I need to make more steadfast efforts to really live in the moment- it would help my service here and help prepare myself more for the road ahead. But how do I develop the capability of living in the moment when I am so eager for it to be 6 months from now when my moments will be spent with Lily in Lijiang?

"event","Dear Live-Journal Text Box, 
I have not written you in quite some time. This certainly does not mean there nothing has been happening, because in actuality many waves of thought have been rippling through my mind, and many activities have been occupying the spans of existence that happen whilst the planet spins. I felt that it was time to give you a bit of an update about what some of these thoughts and activities have been recently. 

Let us, for the sake of organization, split these thoughts and activities up into categories. Let us call the first category 'Relationship', the second category 'Work', and the third category 'Challenges'.

Bear in mind that although I am splitting up my expressions into categories, this does not mean that the expressions themselves are so easily categorized into just one or another of the categories. In truth, all of reality is interconnected, but due to the limitations of the human mind it is necessary for us to organize its elements into convenient organizational patterns that allow us to express our ideas and understand our own thoughts more clearly. The events and thoughts that happen in one's life rarely could ever fit so conveniently into one specific sort of category. In fact, I believe that trying to fragment one's life into various sections, rather than recognizing the inherent interconnectedness of it all, can impair us from being able to develop the capability of recognizing some of the complex interconnections of existence. Nonetheless, here is my life is categorized form:

<b>Category 1: Relationship</b>
I feel incredibly blessed to be in such an amazing relationship. Lily is a soul that posses a myriad personal qualities and attributes, and her heart reflects a brighter light than I have ever felt reflected in anyone. Her genuinity, warmheartedness, truth-seeking attitude, thoughtfulness, compassion, and commitment to service is inspiring and beautiful. The connection I have with her is one that transcends merely this earthly existence and reaches into the depths of forevermore.
Lily and I may currently be living hundreds of kilometers away from each other, but I am happy to report that that is not negatively effecting the strengthening and foundation building processes of our relationship. We talk on Skype or on the phone everyday. We are studying a book together called ""Marriage Can Be Forever- Preparation Counts"". Our jobs are pretty much identical, so we can relate very well to each others daily activities even though we are far away from each other. Being distanced from each other is also teaching us some very important lessons in patience and detachment. 
That being said, it is also quite difficult to be so far away from Lily on this physical plane. In the spiritual realm we are very deeply connected, but my heart yearns to be near her on this earth, to share experiences together, to eat meals together, to build a life together. Knowing that the distance between us is temporary helps a lot. It will likely be May or June when I will be moving to Lijiang. That is only 6 more months. And even before May or June there will be a couple of opportunities when we will get to spend fairly significant amounts of time together. In fact, at the end of December my dad and I will spend a week with Lily (my dad is coming to visit so that he can meet her and her family), then just a month later I will go back to Lijiang for a four week visit. Both of these visits are very near on the horizon and with total over 5 weeks of time to be spent with Lily. This is very exciting to me. Although, I still very much look forward to the time when I don't have to use the word 'visit' when referring to spending time with Lily. 

<b>Category 2: Work</b>
The Junior Youth Empowerment Program I have been working with the Badi Foundation to help build since I arrived in Macau is progressing along slowly but surely. The project is currently still working with just two middle schools (same two schools we've been working with for the past 6 weeks), but other possible schools are in the process of being lined up and hopefully the project will have at least one or two new schools to work with starting next semester. The classes in the two schools that the project is currently working with have been progressing nicely and the students' seem to really be enjoying the learning process aimed at enhancing their capabilities to be of service to their community. 
The other arm of my job, which is to facilitate training sessions for college students and other interested individuals in which we study ""Intellectual Preparation for Social Action"" is also progressing along nicely. The first study group started a couple of months ago and is now coming into the final stretch of the study. The second group will begin in two weeks and will be a group almost entirely made up of friends of the students who were in the first group. This is good. This is organic and natural growth, sparked from genuine interest, creating a strongly interconnected network of individuals who are exploring important concepts related to strengthening their community. 
We are also still in the process of looking for my replacement so that I can move to Lijiang whenever possible.

<b>Category 3: Challenges</b>

3.1: Challenges in Relationship
Refer to Category 1: Relationships for any information regarding this topic

3.2: Challenges in Work
The continuing challenge of trying to figure out how to build this junior youth program largely on my own is beginning to be less of a challenge. As time has progressed, I have been able to share ideas and network with more and more people, making me feel like this project is no longer my own baby, but rather something larger than just myself. While I am still the only salaried staff for the junior youth empowerment program (and will likely remain so until I leave Macau), I no longer feel like I am alone in the process. The assistant teachers I have in my classes have also become more involved in reflection processes related to helping the project grow; other individuals who know about the project have been helping me connect with people, organizations, and schools; and other individuals have arisen to render various acts of service to the project that have been very helpful. All in all I feel like the project has grown into something real and sustainable. 

3.3: Challenges in Life
I am still learning a lot about how to systematize my schedule when I have very limited things that require to be doing something at specific times. I have tasks to do, but often no deadline by when to do them by, and no specific time slots set aside specifically for their purpose. As such, I am still learning a lot about how to be efficient with my time and energy when there is no sort of outside structure provided for me. It is a challenge. 


In summary, life is good. I am happy, though I am eager to leave Macau. I am learning many things and experiencing many challenges, and at times I can feel enveloped in clouds of frustration and longing to be in Lijiang, but things are still good. 

Oh, also, I've read a few really good books recently: 
'Tuesdays with Morrie' was a very good book and a very quick read about an old man's path to prepare himself for death It was very touching and enlightening. 
'Guns, Germs, and Steel' is a thick book I have been chugging through for the past couple of months. It is a book about the history of the world through the eyes of anthropology, sociology, linguistics, etc. It is a very large exploration that strives to discover where humanity has been and where we are headed. 
'Saving Fish From Drowning' is a pretty good written by Amy Tan about a group of travelers from the US who go to Burma and are kidnapped and experience many hardships and struggles along their path. It was pretty good, though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it super highly, I would recommend it it at a moderate level.
And I am currently reading 'Soul Mountiain'- this book I highly highly recommend. It won the Nobel Prize for Literature some years back. It is written by a Chinese author (though the book is banned in mainland China) and is a beautiful and poetic exploration of the Chinese culture through a dream like journey through Chinese traditions, myths, folksongs, stories, etc. I'm not exactly sure why the book is banned in China, since it actually paints China as being a very magical and wonderful place with a depth of history and culture that is awe-inspiring. I have a feeling that it is banned because of a few short paragraphs that criticize certain government actions, although the criticisms I have read thus far are quite small and just on the periphery of the author's mind. 

Okay, I must go. I have been writing this journal entry for way too long. I hope, for those of you who read it all, that you enjoyed the journey."

With that comment out of the way, let me tell you about the basketball game I watched this past Thursday night: The Chinese National Team (aka Chinese All-Stars) versus the Orlando Magic. An NBA team playing a scrimmage games in Macau?! What?! Weird...

As I am walking through the enormous Venetian Hotel & Casino (which, by the way, was just opened and is the largest, not tallest, but largest building in all of Asia and includes the biggest casino in the world.) to get to the basketball arena where the game is being held (which I got free tickets to, by the way), I see advertisements for a few other events soon to be coming to the Venetian:
The Black Eyed Peas (Oct. 27th), Beyonce (Nov. 3), and a tennis match between Sampras and Federer (Nov. 24), as well as another scrimmage basketball game (Cleveland Cavaliers vs. The Chinese National Team).

To those of who who may be living in places like Chicago, New York, or even Portland, these events may not seem like such a surprising thing, but for me, after living in China for the past 2.5 years, events such as these seem incredibly out of place. I mean, when I was living in mainland China I was always on the lookout for any kind of live music, and was always disappointed in not being able to find anything (I used to stop to listen to people playing the Erhu (Chinese violin) in the subway stations in Shanghai just so I could listen to the live music). Now suddenly the pop starlets of the US media are playing shows in China?! 

Anyways, on to the game. It was entertaining, though it was what could be called a slaughter. The Chinese National Team went off to an early 6-2 lead, and then it was all down hill for them from there. By half-time the Orlando Magic was ahead by 26 points, and they seemed to stop trying after that. There were a handful of spectacular moves by a few of the Orlando Magic players (especially Arroyo, wow, he is good), and those were fun to watch. The Chinese National Team was quite boring to watch, as all they did all the time was try to find an open man to shoot a three pointer. However, I am glad I went since I got to spend time with a couple of good friends who are always busy (and since the tickets were free).

If I can manage to get free tickets to the Black Eyed Peas concert I may consider going (even though I don't particularly like their music anymore. NOTE: I used to love their music back when they released Behind the Front in 1998, still appreciated their music but was beginning to fear that they were striving to sell-out with their release of Bridging the Gap in 2000. Then by the time they released Elephunk in 2003, they were in 3/4 'sacrifice the art for the sake of money' mode, and I no longer liked most of the music they were putting out (except for ""Where is the Love?""- That is a great song). Then after that, it kept going downhill and I could no longer stand listening to what they were putting out. I still listen to their 1998 release Behind the Front sometimes, but that's about it.)"

"event","FUNDAEC (www.fundaec.org) has two courses that they offer online. I HIGHLY recommend these courses to anyone who has an interest in sustainable development and is willing to put forth a lot of effort in digging deeply into the concepts and ideas these courses explore. Both courses require a very serious time commitment and very intense mind exercises. These courses will really get you thinking about the internal framework you have that guides you to the decisions you decide to make and the steps you decide to take along life's path. These courses are absolutely amazing!

"event","I had a profound realization today- I really love the sound of birds chirping. 

Macau is one of the most densely populated city in the world, it has about 20,000 people per square kilometer. Compare this to other cities people consider crowded: New York City has 10,000 people per square kilometer. Translation: Macau is twice as crowded as New York City. Chicago has 5,000 people per square kilometer. Translation: Macau is four times more crowded than Chicago. Los Angeles has 3,000 people per square kilometer. Translation: Macau is almost seven times more crowded than Los Angeles!

As such, there is very limited space for birds and the beautiful chirping sounds they often bring with them. Two days ago I heard a bird chirp, and I realized that I hadn't heard a bird chirp in many weeks. The sound of the chirp immediately lifted my spirits. The reason for this is simple. In a crowded place like this, a place that not only is one of the most crowded places in the world, but it also must be one of the most 'under-construction' cities in the world (translation: in every nook and cranny where a building can fit, one is under construction), meaning that all day my ears are either listening to the sounds of jack-hammers, vehicles, or various other loud man-made sounds. So, when I heard a bird chirp two days ago, my ears perked up. Now I am on a mission to notice every none man-made sound in my daily life. Whether it be the wind rustling the dust-covered leaves or the... sound of... the, um... well... hmm.. I can't think of any other non-man-made sounds I hear on a daily basis. However, I will be on a lookout to hear them.

In Linfen I learned to appreciate clear air and full breaths. Now in Macau I am learning to have an even greater appreciation for nature and silence."

"event","During the first week of October, most of China's schools get a week off for their national day holiday. Lily was able to carve out a five day period of time to come and visit me. She doesn't yet have a passport, so she couldn't actually come into Macau (even though it is now officially part of China), so instead we spent those five days in a couple of cities very close to Macau:

Day 1- Thursday, September 27: Lily arrives at the Guangzhou airport at about 8:30 pm. Luckily, her plane is about an hour late, because I am also about 45 minutes late, as I got a bit lost trying to figure out how to get to the airport. Guangzhou is about 2.5 hours away from Macau and I don't know the city very well. 
That night we stay in Guangzhou at a friend's home. The family we stayed with is a very wonderful family, the wife is from Japan, the husband is from Iran, and their three children are amazing. I know their 14 year old son quite well, as he was a participant in a junior youth program I facilitated once upon a time. He is quite an incredible lad, with more innate wisdom that just about any adult I have ever known.

Day 2- Friday, September 28: We spend the morning and the afternoon exploring Guangzhou. We go to Shamian Island, which is famous for being the place where foreigners who are adopting babies from China go to meet their adoptive children. Usually they remain on that island for a couple of months while the paper work and everything is finalized. The island is very quaint and it was nice seeing so many tiny babies everywhere.
Later in the afternoon Lily and I got a bus to Zhuhai. We arrived in Zhuhai in the early evening and went over to another friend's house, the place where we stayed for the next four days. The family's home who we stayed at in Zhuhai is also a really amazing family. The mother is from Columbia, the father is from China (though he wasn't actually there during the time we were there). They have two children, both of whom are incredible individuals. Their 14 year old son might actually get the opportunity to be one of the torch bearers for the upcoming Olympic Games.

Day 3- Saturday, September 29:  In the morning, we went to buy Lily's return ticket back to Lijiang and then spent some time wandering Zhuhai and it's beautiful waterfront (Zhuhai is on a large delta). Then at lunch time we went to a delicious Thai food restaurant. In the afternoon we decided to take a boat ride around the outside of Macau. Since Lily was not able to go into Macau due to not having a passport, we thought it would be nice to take a boat ride around the outside of Macau so I could point out to her the area where I live and some other places that are meaningful to my life. It was nice, but I do wish I could have shown her around Macau from within Macau. In the evening, we went back to our temporary home and had dinner with the family. After dinner we sat on the balcony (I sat in the hammock) for a couple of hours.

Day 4- Sunday, September 30: For breakfast, we went to the border of Macau and met my roommate (Matt) and his girlfriend (Amy). We had a wonderful south China breakfast (dim-sum) and then proceeded to go to a music store so my roommate could buy a guitar. Matt & Amy then went back to Macau and Lily & I went to a water park for the day. This water park had a wave pool and four large water slides. We were there from about 11 am until 5 pm. It was a great escape from the blazing heat of the bright south China summer sun. In the evening we went back to our temporary home and spent a couple of hours studying ""Marriage Can Be Forever- Preparation Counts.""

Day 5- Monday, October 1: We spent the day at home. We watched a movie. We studied ""Marriage Can Be Forever- Preparation Counts."" We read. We talked. We ate. We relaxed. We did some planning to figure out some of the specific steps that would be necessary to build a kindergarten in Lijiang. (The current plan for whenever it is I move to Lijiang is that for the first two years I'll teach English at the university while concurrently studying Chinese intensively. Then after two years, we'll begin building a kindergarten.)

Day 6- Tuesday, October 2: In the late morning we decide to go into Zhuhai and make our way towards the part of the waterfront known as Lovers Lane. This is the area of the waterfront that is dotted with parks, statues, and nice walking areas. We walked along the waterfront for a couple of hours, stopping to eat pizza for lunch. We then went out to this small island and found a hidden little path that went to the top of the small hill in the center of the island. We spent about two hours on the top of the hill, appreciating the view and hiding from the rain. We found a little hideaway where the rain couldn't get us, so we remained there for a very long time while we waited for the rain to subside. For dinner we went to a fancy steak restaurant and had a delicious meal. After dinner we went back to our temporary home and sat on the balcony talking about life.

Day 7- Wednesday, October 3: It is time for Lily to go :(. At 9:30 she was on a bus heading for the airport and I went back across the border to go get ready for my Wednesday afternoon classes.

"event","Here are the lyrics for a song I just finished writing last night. The rhythm of the song is a bit slow and the sound is somewhat dark. I've been listening to Abstract Tribe Unique a lot recently, and I think that style of sound sunk its way into this song a bit.

(0:42) I envision- new conditions- if decisions
aren't renditions- of traditions- mental prisons.-
If you listen- to the wisdom- of a brighter Vision
you will be among them who have risen
to initiate a mission- to unite dem- nations-
that are fightin'- chokin' human rights tight as a python/

As the swords flash and the shafts fly like a clash of the titans,
you will either hide from the cries and be frightened
or arise like a phoenix as it flies from the sun...
It is time to strike like thunder
and tear asunder- the veils that divide...
Have you ever wondered
if there is a greater oneness
that we all can recognize?
If you ponder- on the world- with your inner eye
your mind will wander to the pearls that reside...
If you dive into life with a purpose in your steps
then you'll find how to dwell in the deeper depths,
then your latent powers manifest destiny's treasure chest.
Mystical gifts live in this if we listen to intuitive evidence.
(1:48) I suggest that we test it with more than what we sense.
I've contested the methods that are limited to the present tense,
cuz even accurate measurements can never capture the Essence.
This is evident to heaven's residents
who abide beyond space and time's limited- reach.
Let this thought sit for a bit, never drop it.
It can teach what it is to be free
from the prison that we keep- in our midst./

I envision- new conditions- if decisions
aren't renditions- of traditions- mental prisons.-
If you listen- to the wisdom- of a brighter vision
you will be among them who have risen
to initiate a mission- to unite dem- nations-
that are fightin'- chokin' human rights tight as a python/
(2:36) As the swords flash and the shafts fly press onward.
Respond to the Word as a champion would,
like a Ghandi whose standing on the edge of the world.../...

God sees how we serve, and He frees us to work
on the needs of the earth if we learn how to nurture the seeds He unearths.
If we turn to Him first-, then we learn- to align- to His verses- immersed- in His mercy
and our search- will in turn be- firm in the verities
that verily- carry these- very deeds- heavenly..
So we sink into service to drink from the fountain of purpose...

"event","Life always throws tests and challenges along our path, some small, others large enough to sneak into every aspect of life. At this moment in my life, I recognize that numerous challenges are surrounding me (externally and internally), but two of them seem to stand out in my recent reflections on what I need to learn in order for my grown process to progress:

Challenge #1) In my current job I set my own schedule, set my own work pace, decide where I want to work, when I want to work, what I want to do, how I want to do it, etc etc. In short, there is almost no structure automatically provided for me. I have a few things that I do during the week where I have to be at a particular place at a particular time to do something specific, but the overwhelming majority of my working hours are left completely up to my own discretion. This presents me with some challenges. I am used to having at least some structure, and I've come to rely on these elements of structure to keep me on task. Now I don't have that and I am having to learn how to develop my own structure in my days. I am not sure if I am getting better at this yet or not. Sometimes I see progress, other times I seem to slide backwards. 

Have you ever had a job where you had to set up the structure on your own? Do you have any advice to offer this striving soul?


Challenge #2) Having a long-distance relationship is hard. I feel like Lily and I are doing a very good job at communicating often (everyday, in fact) and are able to continue to build our relationship quite well while far away from each other. However, I miss her ridiculously and sometimes feel pangs of yearning to leave Macau and move to Lijiang to be near her. I realize that right now I can't just leave Macau ->
<i>(I am the only person working on this junior youth empowerment program, and it is an important program, so we need to find someone to replace me and then train them before I will be able to leave here- that will likely take at least a year--- Any of you people out there have experience with the Junior Youth Empowerment Program (AKA Breezes of Confirmation, Walking the Straight Path, Drawing of the Power of the Word) AND also have an interest in working in the field of educational development AND are also comfortable working by yourself AND are relatively comfortable working in a job where you have to figure out most things on your own through sometimes difficult steps AND have an interest in China. If you fit into most of these categories and are interested in finding out more about this job, email me, you may just be able to take over my job and allow me to move to Lijiang.)</i>


Another thought that arose while writing this) I need to start writing more often! I haven't written anything for like 4 or 5 months, and now when I sit down to write it feels unnatural and my words feel forced. Even while writing this blog entry, I feel like my words are much less fluid and natural than usual. I need to learn how to structure more time into my life for the purpose of writing. 

I'm out......"

"event","Over the past two days I have had two very distinct moments that really stuck out for some reason, as being moments that transmitted a deep sense of joy. Here they are:

1) The first moment was Saturday morning at about 8:30, I was walking down the streets of Macau on my way to meet three people to begin studying ""Intellectual Preparation for Social Action (IPSA)"" with them(an amazing book created by <a href=""http://www.fundaec.org"">FUNDAEC</a>, an incredible NGO in Columbia that has developed some incredible materials centered in community and individual development). I was listening to my mp3 player and a song by one of my favorite hip-hop artists ever, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverse""> Diverse</a>, came up on the playlist. (I could only find one site on the internet that has links to any of his lyrics, and it only has one song, which is a good song but definitely not my favorite by his, nonetheless, the lyrics are still quite good, so you can go<a href=""http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/m/mosdef2689/wylinout701168.html""> here </a> if you so wish.) I was listening to a song entitled ""Blind Man"" in which Diverse is talking about how he would quest his whole life to have the vision of a blind man, and I was struck with this deeply felt feeling of contentment and joy. 

2) The second moment was Sunday at around 5:00 pm, I was walking home after finishing an intensive weekend of facilitating the IPSA study, and was suddenly struck by a sense of deep joy as I looked around and took in how much diversity exists in Macau. As my eye gazed from person to person I noticed people from so many different countries and people dressed in so many different ways, and I suddenly realized how unique <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau"">Macau</a> really is. I suddenly felt happy to be living in Macau, for perhaps the first time since I moved here. It had been hard for me to adjust to the fast-pace and materialistic tendencies of Macau, but I'm beginning to finally notice the positive points of Macau too, and I do feel quite blessed to be here."

May 6- ~June 15: Javad is in Macau beginning in the process of building a junior youth empowerment program. He is going through many process of learning and reflection, as well as taking actions to begin the concrete building process. He presents the program to two schools in Macau who both express that they see a bright future for the junior youth empowerment program at their school. He is hoping he will start teaching the program at their schools in the fall semester.

June 16- July 6: Javad is in Yunnan province in southwest China. He is there to observe and learn from a couple of educational development organizations, as well as participate in some training sessions. While there his life changes. He meets the woman who he feels confident will someday be his wife (for more details on this aspect of the story, please feel free to email me at eyeoflayman at yahoo.com- I have chosen to not share further on this aspect of the story on my online blog, but I am very open to sharing with anyone individually. I have included a photo of this wonderful woman and I on this blog posting. And I will just briefly say that her name is Lily, she is from Lijiang, and she is an incredible person that every one of you would fall in love with if you met her. We are now systematically exploring each others characters. I am the luckiest person in the world.)

July 6--- July 29: Javad is in Beijing. He picked up his mom at the airport in Beijing on July 6th (30 minutes after he himself arrived in the airport from Yunnan province). It is now July 7th on the calendar. He spent today helping his mom buy things for her business (she started a small business a couple of years ago selling Chinese antique furniture, art, crafts, etc at a couple of antique malls in the Olympia, Washington area.) Javad will help her for the next couple of days, then he will help set up for an upcoming training session going on in Beijing, being put on by the Badi Foundation. The training is all about development, educational development, community development, personal development, development projects and learnings from them, conceptual framework for social action, intellectual preparation for social action, junior youth empowerment, human resource empowerment, etc. The training is from July 12-29.

July 29----: Two possibilities: I may be in Yunnan again :) from August 1-15 helping assist in some summer teaching sessions with the lovely Lily. This is likely, but not certain. I may have to return to Macau to do a couple of demo classes for some schools that may be interested in the junior youth empowerment program in Macau. I will find out later. They are both wonderful options, but if I go to Yunnan (Lijiang), I will get to spend two weeks in her hometown village with her family helping her with some wonderful things."

"event","It has been 4 months since my last post. The livejournal website is now blocked in mainland China. I figure this is a pretty good excuse for being absent from the livejournal world for so long.

The reason I can now write this post is- I am no longer in mainland China. I have moved. I am now living in Macau (off the southern coast of mainland China, next to Hong Kong). 

<b>ABOUT MACAU</b>-
As of 1998, Macau is officially part of China, but as a special administrative region with it's own government. Macau was a colony of Portugal for hundreds of years (starting in the late 1500's), and was used mostly as a trading port. Macau was officially handed over to China in 1998 (Britian then handed over Hong Kong to China one year later). The culture here is a mix between Chinese and European. The most common language spoken is Cantonese (spoken in southern China and Hong Kong). It's quite a unique place with a very interesting history. The arcitecture is a mix between Portugese and Chinese (as well as the modern, standard, boring architecture). Macau is considered to be the Las Vegas of Asia, in fact the casinos in Macau make more money than the casinos in Las Vegas, so the gaming industry here is huge. This is causing a lot of economic growth to happen, but it is taking a negative toll on the culture, turning it more materialstic. It is ecspecially playing a negative roll on the upcoming youth culture, because huge numbers of high schoolers and other youth are focusing their future on the gaming industry since there is a lot of money that can be made for those who work for one of the many casinos. Many high school students are actually dropping out of school to go and work for the casinos (the casinos are required, by law, to hire local people and not foreigners, and they tend to seek out young and attractive people to work in the casino. This often means that youth are hired because of their attractive look.). The youth can make a lot of money working at these casinos (almost US$2000 per month, which by standards here is a huge amount). The large amount of money that so many youth suddenly make is causing a huge growth in the culture of materialism here. Money is on everyone's mind. 
Despite this huge sprawling gaming and materialism industry, the culture and most of the people and the scenery is actually quite charming.

There are 3 sections of Macau: 
1- The peninsula, connected to mainland China, is, by some studies and standards, the most densely populated area in the entire world (kind of funny to think about how I just moved out of the most polluted city in the world and now I am moving into the city that includes the most densely populated area in the world). It is crowded, lots of casinos, lots of narrow streets with tall high rises, lots of cars and motorcycles, lots of people everywhere you go. (I am temporarily living in this part of Macau for now, with a friend, while I look for more permanent housing.)
2- Taipa Island: Not as densely populated. Wide streets. Lots of cars. Some forrests and hills. Some very large casinos. Lots of casinos currently under construction. 
3- Coloane Island: Sparcely populated. Lots of forrests and hills. Beautiful scenery. Peaceful atmosphere. (It is very likely I will be living on Coloane Island. I went and looked at an apartment there yesterday. It was very nice and by far the cheapest place I have yet found, only US$100 per month. It is in a very peaceful and beautiful area.)

<b>HOW'D YOU END UP IN MACAU?</b>
If you had told me two months ago that I would be living in Macau now, I wouldn't have believed you. I was working in Shanxi provinence, and I was quite content and happy with my experience, and was actually envisioning myself remaing there for the next couple of years. My job was challenging and envigorating (though I times I yearned to have more responsibility). Everything was great. Then I was offered a job in Macau. After a lot of prayerful reflection, I decided to take the job in Macau. I am now very happy I did take this job. My new job is everything my job in Shanxi was, except now I have a much deeper form of responsibility, and I will inevitably be challenged like I have never been challenged before. 

<b>WHAT IS YOUR NEW JOB?</b>
I am working for the Badi Foundation (Badi Foundation is an NGO that focuses on social and economic development in China. They have various projects working to empower rural women in villages throughout mainland China. That has been one of their main aims throughout their existence (I'm not sure exactly how old they are, but something like 8 years old). Badi also works with projects that focus on the empowerment of junior youth.). My job is officially titled- ""Coordinator for the Junior Youth Empowerment Program."" This means that I am in charge of coordinating and helping to build a junior youth empowerment program here in Macau. This means that I will be communicating with various public and private schools to set up either afterschool programs or in school classes that is focused on a cirriculum that aims to empower the junior youth by helping them to reflect on profound moral concepts, helping them to enhance their powers of expressions (through words and art), and helping them put their understandings of these moral concepts into the expressive form of service for their community (meaning we will be doing various service projects). This project is brand new here in Macau, so as of now the Badi Foundation has not communicated with any schools or start anything with the process of building this program. This is what I will be doing. My initial role will be to network and communicate with people who either work in schools as teachers or administrators, or those who have connections with people who work in schools (perhaps parents of students). By sharing the vision of the program with them, I hope to find people who connect with the purpose of the program and see the need for a program of this nature in their schools. Then I will present the program to the administration. Then once that has all happened, the door will open to begin offering the classes as either an after school program or in-school classes. Once a relationship has been formed with a school, my job will be to be the 'teacher' in these junior youth groups (I put teacher in '' because to me the world teacher signifies that you teach to students, whereas in my opinion the word animator or even facilitator works better because, to me, this signifies that you are helping the students to teach themselves. Education is much more sustainable and useful if the students are teaching themselves rather than relying on others to teach them. In my mind a teacher is supposed to help guide the students to figuring out how to do this.). As part of the longer term vision, after I have worked with a school for a period of time, the goal would be to then start training local teachers to continue to carry on the program within their own school, with the continued support of the Badi Foundation. To make the program more sustainable, we hope to bring the program into schools, help the teachers gain an understanding for the purpose and the vision of the program, work with them by teaching together with them and then after time giving them feedback as they become the teachers of the class, and then slowly the goal would be to step back and allow the program to organically continue to grow on its own through the efforts of the teachers at the school. It is all very exciting stuff.
I am very excited to be working on this project, though I am also quite overwhelmed and somewhat scared. I am the only full-time staff working on this project. This means I have a plethora of tasks and responsibilities. Luckily, due to the fact that the Badi Foundation is so well-respected and well-known in this area, it is quite easy to enlist the assistance of volunteers for various aspects of the project when necessary. This will be necessary in the long-run, for sure. 
Overall, though, the fear and feelings of overwhelmingness I have are outweighed by the excitement and joy I feel for being able to have the opportunity to do this service that I know I will grow from. I have never felt so certain that an experience would force me to challenge the boundaries of my self-perceived capacity, forcing me to push beyond what I before believed I could do. I am certain this is a lesson-in-action I will be learning. 

<b>HOW LONG WILL YOU BE IN MACAU?</b>
I will be here for at least two years. My current contract is a two-year contract. Once it gets close to the end of that contract, reflection will occur. Who knows if I will remain here longer than that or if I will continue on to another experience. Only time will tell.


Now that I am in Macau, know that I will be updating my livejournal more frequently. Now that I am in an area where livejournal is not blocked. 
Also know that I am incredibly excited to have access to Wikipedia again, because that was another stellar website that is blocked in mainland China. 
Okay, I must go eat dinner, I am hungry."

"event","Someone broken into my apartment last night (sometime between 3am and 7am) and took my computer and my cell phone. Luckily, most of my important stuff is on my external hard drive (work related and music related). I will also be going back to the US for a short visit in a couple of weeks, so perhaps I can muster up the money to get another laptop. I definitely feel that I need one. I use my computer so often it's ridiculous. I make music on it a few times per week. I use it for work almost everyday. God, I'm glad I have prayers to lean on to keep me calm and centered. When I first discovered my computer was gone (about an hour ago) an internal wave of anger swept to the surface, so I quickly grabbed my prayer book and said a bunch of prayers. The anger disappeared, a contemplative calm took its place. And I'm so glad I have good friends. After saying prayers I called up a couple of friends to express my thoughts and feelings regarding the situation. Yet again, detachment happened. Prayers are wonderful, friends are wonderful. Thieves suck."

"event","Usually when I find myself in a state of mind where I feel like writing a blog entry it is when I am very content with the happenings in my life and I want to express my joy and the experiences and emotions I have had that have caused me to feel as such. Rarely do I ever want to express the more negative aspects of my life, usually because I don't like to dwell on them, and also because I don't like to spread negative energies that would possibly cause other people to feel down. However, I do see some positive benefits to expressing the more negative things in life also, though usually I find these benefits to be outweighed by the negative aspects of such an expression. There is something to be said about expressing the negative aspects in order to be able to reflect and deal with them more directly, and in that process hopefully they will begin to fade away and be overtaken by the joy I strive to infuse within my existence. As such, I think it is time for me to express some of the challenges and frustrations I have been facing recently that have been bringing me down. 

Living in a city like Linfen certainly has it's challenges. The pollution in this city can really bring down my mood and has the ability to significantly lower my energy level if I let it get to me. I find myself dreading the simple act of walking out of my front door because of the heavy doses of coal dust I am forced to inhale with every passing breath. I feel like I have not had a full breath since the moment I set foot here. That can definetly take a toll of my mood. The sky is cloaked by clouds of grey at every moment, and even on days when I consider the sky to be quite clear, in reality it is only a slight tint of blue that I am seeing that reminds me what the color of the sky is supposed to be. I think it is largely because of the pollution that I find my energy level quite low almost always. Everyday I have spurts of energy, but these spurts of energy inevitably fade away after a short period of time. Recently this has been affecting my ability to perform my duties to the utmost of my capacity. I find myself having to quickly capture my energetic moments in order to be able to do my work. Then after I have done my work about an hour, I have to internally fight with myself in order to continue working on my projects. If a project that I am working on could usually be done after a few days of work, I find myself having to work on it for weeks before it is done. I have one long-term project I have been working on for the past couple of months, and in reality it really should already be done by now, but my moments of motivation have been so few and short lived that I have really been stretching out the project well beyond the time I imagined I would need. Now, in this circumstance it is not too big of a deal, since my deadline is still about a month away and I don't really envision any problems in getting it done in that length of time, but nonetheless I would like to move on to other projects and be able to dedicate my energy to a variety of different things. I am seeing the same thing happening with my music production recently. Whereas before when I sat down to write lyrics for a song, it wouldn't be a problem to write words for an entire 4-5 minute song, and my motivation and inspiration would remain strong and steady throughout. Now I find myself writing about a minutes worth of lyrics and then my motivation to continue fades away into just a dim hope that my energy will rearrive. Again, since I don't have a specific deadline as to when I want to have my current CD project finished, it is not a huge deal, the CD will get done and the steps are still being taken so that this will occur, it is just that these steps are being taken much more slowly than I had hoped. 

I have also been struggling with my day-to-day food intake. When I was living in the US I ate a variety of different foods, sometimes sandwiches, sometimes burritos, sometimes rich and vegetables, sometimes this and sometimes that, but there was always a wide variety in the tastes of the food I would intake. In Linfen I find myself eating different foods that I now perceive as all tasting pretty much the same. The amount of oil and MSG in the food has began to make all food taste like oil and MSG with some other small added flavors, and this is even when I ask for them to not use MSG and only use a little bit of oil. It is quite rare when I eat a meal and feel satisfied by it afterwards. This isn't to say that Chinese food in general is bad and all tastes the same. When I was in Shanghai (and in just about every other city I have ever been to it China) I felt like there was quite a variety of different tastes that I would be intaking from the various venues I would eat at, Linfen just doesn't seem to be a very good place for food. I was warned a bit about this before I got here, and over the past couple of months I have really discovered the roots of where these warnings came from. 

I am also frustrated about not knowing what I will be doing next fall. I am contemplating a lot about my life long goals and see Linfen providing me with many learnings I really think will help me grow and develop in the exact right directions I hope to progress, but at the same time I am as yet unclear about what specific job I may be able to have if indeed I do remain in Linfen next year. I know that I want a job where I am much more involved with consulting and helping to shape the vision and long-term, service oriented goals of the school, but I am as yet quite unclear about what my job description would be if I continued to stay here longer. I would not want to continue doing the exact same thing I am doing right now, as I often feel outside of the circle of important activity. One thing I have discovered about myself is I like to be part of shaping the wider vision and though I also like to be involved with the actual action and day-to-day, get-your-hands-dirty service, I find that I can't be as effective with the in-the-moment vision unless I am also involved with the more long-term, wider aspects of the vision itself. Right now I don't feel I am getting that aspect and I am not ready to commit myself to a longer period of time here unless I can be guaranteed that I will have some responsibilities beyond the in-the-moment vision. As such my future feels quite up in the air. Now usually in my life I have no problem with this future-up-in-the-air feeling, I mean I've been spending one year time having many different experiences over the past few years, and usually haven't know what I would be doing the next year until that year was about to begin, but I think I have had enough of not knowing more than a few months ahead of me what I am going to be doing and where I am going to be. I am at a point in my life where I want to remain somewhere for a period of time longer than just a year. It's not that I feel that I need to implant roots somewhere or anything right now, it's just that I want to be able to deepen my friendships more with the people that surround me, and I want to live in a place that makes me feel like home. Right now whenever I have gone to visit my family, I feel like I am visiting home, I want my visits to my family to feel like I am visiting my family and that when I return from visiting my family I am returning home. Instead, when I return from visiting my family I feel like I am leaving home.

I also strongly strongly desire to be surrounded by a music community, by fellow hip-hop heads and poets and other musicians. I miss having musicians around more than I can adequetly express. I never really realized how much I need that in my life until I came to China, where I have not been able to find a music community at all. There is a monthly open mic that goes on at the local university here, put on by an English teacher from Australia, so I do have a place where I can perform a song or two once a month, but it just isn't fulfilling the need that I have to be surrounded by creativity and expressiveness. I need creativity and expressiveness not just within myself, but in my surrounding environment. Without it I have began to feel a certain void that ain't the best void I've known. 

Alright, that is enough of my bickering for now. Before I sign off though, I think it important for me to express that overall I am quite happy and content with where I am. This blog entry is a bit of a rant of the challenges and struggles I feel in my day-to-day life, but these are rants that exist in the moment right now and are not always lingering inside of me at any given moment. Today I felt a need to express these challenges because I had an experience of having a heck of a lot of energy that faded away almost completely after about an hour and I was frustrated about it, so I felt a need to do a little bit of ranting in order to cleanse off some of the dust that was surrounding my mind. After this expression I feel that there is a certain kind of weight that has been lifted from off of my shoulders, and now I am feel much more ready to walk into my weekend with my spirits high and my mind focused on growth and progress. I am ready to take on whatever the world wants to send me way and have full faith that whatever experiences I am going through in the day to day of my life are only making me stronger and more prepared to grow from my experiences. In all honesty, these challenges are really blessings that are necessary for me to have if I am to push beyond myself and reach to new heights of growth and progress that will allow me to become more than I am now and hopefully more than what I perceive the utmost of my capacity to be. Without these challenges I would be floating through life in a cloud of stagnance that would hinder me from finding the pearls hidden within my shell. Without these challenges I would not be able to learn how I can best be of service to humanity. Thank God I will grow."

"event","Well hello there. Fancy meeting you here. How have you been? 
Has life been sprinkling little morsels of wonderfulness or heavy weights of tribulation?
There are certainly many nutritional values that both of the above offer, but I pray that your experiences have been and continue to be enriching.

You may have noticed that I haven't updated my livejournal here in quite a long time (looks like it has been about six weeks since my last post). I would say I apologize for the long gap in between entries, but I actually am not sorry for this gap, therefore you will be receiving no sort of apology. If on the other hand you are one of the unlucky souls who has emailed me over the past few months, I deeply apologize for the ubber long wait-for-reply time that you have had to experience.

So, what have I been doing over these past couple of months you ask. Where to begin. Well, I've been continuing to live my exsistence, experiencing plenty of tests and plenty of blessings. Living in a place like Linfen certainly does bring on the occasional hardship. As the weather has been getting colder and colder (it dropped down to below -10 celsius today), the coal has been being burned in abundance to keep buildings warm. The sky is a constant hazy shade of dark grey. The smell of burning coal permeates the air and is inhaled with every passing breath. Often I can't see more than a block or two down the street before my vision is blocked by the clouds of coal dust. The pollution is definetly my most consistent and constant test, but there definetly are more. However I am not one that enjoys over expressing about the negative elements of life, as I have no desire to linger in these things that can be as veils to my overall happiness if I allow them to effect me. Therefore I will no longer express my complaints and I will move on to something more uplifting and happy-happy-joy-joy like.

Like cheese. I dreamt about cheese two nights ago. I was riding in a wheelbarrow with a couple of friends to my grandmother's house. When we arrived my grandma was preparing sandwiches for us all. I was going to have a grilled tomato and cheese sandwich on whole wheat bread (it is almost impossible to get decent bread or any sort of cheese here). I pondered on my cheese options for a ridiculously long time, envisioning the shape and texture of each type of cheese, until I was interupted by waking up with a growling stomach yearning for cheese. As fate would have it, I then had the wonderful opportunity of eating cheese that same evening. It was a wonderful delight. There is one pizza joint in town, decent pizzas, and they use imported cheese! It was heavenly (other than the price, which would have been 1/10 of my monthly wage had I actually had to pay for it). 

On to more pressing matters. Work. Is wonderful. I love my job. It is incredibly fulfilling. It keeps me beyond busy, but it is all enjoyable stuff. I have been spending a lot of time working on a couple of projects recently. I have been in the process of developing an English teaching book (in conjunction with one of my coworkers) that can help students we work with gain a stronger foundation in the English language before they continue on into the regular series of books that we use in the classroom. The books we use can sometimes be too difficult for some of the younger classes we work with, so this book aims to be a bridge that gets the students used to the teaching methods we utilize (such as cooperative learning) and more familiar with the concepts that are intertwined within the books we use. 
I have also been working on an evaluation project (also in conjunction with one of my coworkers) that aims to get a more clear picture for what kind of impact our classes are having on the students. That is an enjoyable project too. 
I have also been spending my Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in the classroom. Recently most of my inside the classroom duties have been to observe classes and offer my feedback, and it will for the most part continue on that way for the remainder of this semester, although I will be taking over one class (three days a week) from one of the volunteers here who will be departing from the area. I am actually really looking forward to that, because for the past three weeks I actually haven't taught any classes, I have only been observing classes and offering feeback, which is enjoyable, but it starts to get quite boring after awhile. 
I have been enjoying the transformation of one of my classes. I have one class that I taught fully at the beginning of the semester, and then over the course of the semester I aimed to help train an intern who then took over the class while I have been continuing on as an assistant. Over the course of the semester this class has continually amazed me. This class is perceived by most teachers in the school to be the 'worst' class in the school. They have a reputation of being stupid. And they are sometimes treated as such by others. I have witnessed this class experience some shit that I didn't much appreciate. It is easy to see that many of these students have probably experienced a lot of people looking down on them over the course of their life, but in our class they have really started to shine. I have seen some of these youth completely transform over the course of the semester. It is inspiring to an intense degree.

Enough about work. How about music. I have been spending all of my free moments working on music and writing. It is my meditation, it is my release, it is my relaxer, it helps balance me internally, it helps me stretch my creative muscles, it is my passion. I have been making one or two new beats per week, writing at least two times per week, recording whenever my house is relatively empty, and networking and collaborating with fellow spirited musicians via the internet. I am actually working on a handful of collaboration projects right now. I have been working in collaboration with this cat from Hong Kong that has has been fruitful. The collaboration project we did was quite simple, I sent him one of my beats, he added some other sounds (flute, Chinese stringed instrument, a few cool electronic sounds, etc). But from this collaboration I have been invited to join in on a compilation project where about twenty musicians from around China (mostly down in Hong Kong) will be submitting one song each to compile into a compilation CD. I am looking forward to seeing what becomes of this. Some of the musicians who will be on this CD are quite stellar. The CD will be everything from hip-hop, to electronica, to trip-hop, to ambient, to rock.
Another collaboration project I have been working on is with this female vocalist from Boston. She has got a really nice voice that fits perfect in the trip-hop vibe (like Portishead), so we are building a track that combines a trip-hop and hip-hop type style. I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.
Another collaboration project I have been working on is with this female poet from Utah. We are using a beat I made last year that has digereedoo sounds, lots of drums, a flute, a bassoon, and some ambient electronic sounds.
My friend Nehemiah and I have also just about finished up our collaborative track. He made this killer beat (has a bit of a persian vibe, combined with some solid hip-hop beats) and I wrote a flow with it. It turned out real hot. We are finishing up the final details on the track now.
There are a few other collaborations that I have been in communication with people about and that have taken the first steps into being collaboration projects, but the ones I mentioned above are the ones that will be finished soon. 

Alright, I have been writing this entry for way too long. If hope you have enjoyed this journey through space and time. 

Let me leave you with a few photographs to ponder upon:

This picture is so blurry, oh wait that is just the pollution:<br>

"event","I need some suggestions for a name to call my one-person hip-hop crew. When I make music with my good friend Aaron, we call ourselves Cool-Calm-Collected. I had the stage name Layman for awhile. I've thought a lot about keeping my artist name as Javad. I've thought about starting a record label at some point called Spiritual Lyricist's Sphere. (But I am thinking I will probably be working with Emiliano and his ""Virtuous Evolution"" instead of staring my own label).
But now that I am in the process of making a CD I need to come up with a name that I will put on the front of the CD as my artist name. What should it be? I've already came up with a name I like for the name of the album, ""Breadth-n-Effect."" But I don't know what to call myself. I want the name to express why I make music, yet not be too stiff. I want the name to be unique and creative, yet still be understandable, purposeful and can be related to. I want it to be something that can be remembered, but that is not imposing. I don't want it to be too long or too short. I want it to express who I am, but I don't want it to be an expression of the ego. I want it to reflect the latent noble nature of humanity, but I don't want it to be lame. I want it to express the importance of unlocking the potentials that lay latent within human consciousness, but doing this without being an expression of the ego. I want it to be the perfect name. Any suggestions?"

This is Rebecca, Grace, me, and Jamie working diligently on a project for work. (Jamie is another occational roommate. I say occational because sometimes I live at the house of Arthur, Nick, Forrest, and Kyle and sometimes I live at Jamie's home. All of my stuff is in the five person house, but I actually usually sleep at Jamie's place since it is less crowded. I can't actually move my stuff there though since there are no officially empty bedrooms, but one of the bedrooms is only occupied once every couple of weeks, so I stay there whenever that rooms usual tenant is not staying there. You could say I have two homes, you could say I am homeless. I wouldn't refute either statement. I feel like I am homeless with two homes.)

"event","Overhead the smog lingers heavy.
The horizon stretchs a few blocks,
Beyond which dust blocks the view.
I try to gaze into the distance,
but am confined only to the here.
I hear edifices being erected,
but cannot see the actual where.
The haze coats my skin visably,
though my lungs get the brunt.
I have grown accustomed to this,
and am content in the darkness,
though the sun shines unclouded,
it is hard at times to perceive.

The sullied specks of atmosphere,
they tell stories of this place,
they speak of actual priorities,
they whisper thousands of pasts.
Pasts of constant struggle,
shifting into the present stage,
where opportunity opens new doors,
doors of exploitation and change.

Survival has never been as now,
prospects for wealth surround.
Where once oppression flourished,
now the scene is new everyday.
Generation still alive remember,
the young have not had to face.
The blessings of progress abound,
whilst ghosts of the path haunt. 

The future is destined to be,
the past will help the vision.
The hope is lessons are learned,
not to be forgotten by greed.
I believe bright days are ahead,
realizations are being infused.
Innocent voices now have a chance,
a chance be what they choose to be.
Though limitations still yet exist,
possibilities expand by the day.

I watch all of this as it occurs,
feeling powerless to do a thing,
but I render what I am able to do,
and believe our efforts bear fruit.
In service we help pave the road,
so our concrete must be developed,
then we can step into the future
with steadfast feet of solid brass."

"event","It has been three weeks since my last livejournal post. There are a handful of reasons for such a long gap between entries. 

1) I don't have the internet at my apartment yet (key word is yet, I'm gonna be getting it soon).

2) I have been incredibly busy recently (as soon as I got back from my quick two-week family visit I began an intense two week training session in which we studied Intellectual Preparation for Social Action and studied other materials related to teaching English and moral education).

3) There are so many things running through my head these days that I don't know where to start when writing a livejournal entry (reflections on the future, reflections on the present, educational development stuff, personal development stuff, personal systematic spiritual progression framework stuff, reflections on the state of the world stuff, thoughts about my hopes of meeting my future wife, thoughts about my growing desire to have a family, thoughts about past relationships (and the fact that the woman from one of my strongest past relationships recently got engaged- Autumn), thoughts about how I can be the best that I can be in my current job, thoughts about what skills I should be working on developing to be able to be of the most service in my current job, thoughts about whether educational development is the field I want to study for grad school, thoughts about what I could do in the world that can be of best service, thoughts about how I can utilize my love for making music to help humanity progress, thoughts about what themes and concepts I can write about that can make the hip-hop-ish CD I am working on be as good as it can possibly be, thoughts about ways I can go about publishing a book of poetry, reflections about whether my strong desire to share my poetry and music with others is coming from a selfless or selfish place inside me, thoughts about how I can systematically continue to make my music come from a more and more selfless place within me, thoughts about the role of hip-hop in today's society- both in the West and in China, thoughts on the future of hip-hop in China and the role it will play in the development of this country, reflections on how to help hip-hop in China from becoming ridiculous, reflections on how to network with people to help build a strong network of spirited hip-hop heads who want to play shows around China, reflections on whether or not I will spend a longass period of my lifespan in China, and some other stuff too).

4) My life is so much different in Linfen that it has ever before been, so I don't even know where to start when I sit down to write about my life here (living in a two bedroom house with five guys, have a water schedule that greatly affects my sleep schedule (I have to time my shower and laundry times so that I am certain to have water when I need it), having a strong community of co-workers that are my roommates and the people I spend every waking moment with (there are like 12 people that I see just about seven days a week- and I am used to being quite an independent person).

Anyhoo, yeah, within those four expressions above I also included some of what I have been doing recently. So there are my internal thoughts and external happenings as of late. I'm gonna go home now and work on a poetry project I've decided to undertake. I love you."

"event","I'm in the United States right now, just for a quick trip to see my family for less than two weeks. Let me tell you the things I have noticed the most about the USA since rearriving here after time away:

1) Politics/George W. Bush/hatred/cynicism is on everyone's mind.
2) Too many people are fat, lazy, and overwatch TV.
3) There are a ridiculous amount of fast food restaurants.
4) Many people here love alchohol and marijuana, a lot. 
5) Every family has a ridiculous amount of cars.
6) Noone rides bicycles (and I've been in the most bike friendly city in the USA for the past 3 days- aka Eugene, Oregon)
7) The air quality is so good here! (I'm living in the most polluted city in the world- Linfen, China) 
8) I can see the stars at night!
9) There are so many trees!
10) I speak the same language as everyone else around me!
11) So many people can appreciate and/or play quality music! (there is a limited creative scene in many parts of China)

I've been in the USA for about five days now. It never ceases to amaze me that when I leave the USA to reside in foreign lands, I never experience much culture shock, but whenever I return to the USA after being away for awhile, the culture shock very much exists. 

Despite the culture shock, I am loving my time here. Incredibly so. I do miss home quite a lot. This weekend my family and I went down to Eugene, Oregon (where I grew up) to visit my extended family (on my dad's side). I got to spend the weekend with my grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncles, four cousins, and two second cousins. I certainly miss my family. 
I also had the chance to hang out with some of my very good friends. My good friend, Aaron, who has been one of my closest friends since fourth grade recently moved back to Eugene. So I got to hang out with him quite a lot (he'll be coming up to stay with my family in Olympia for a few days too). Some of my other friends whom I haven't seen in years were also in town, so it was good to catch up and see what people are up to these days.
The plans for the rest of my 8 days in the USA involve buying things (mostly food and books) that I can't get in China that can fit into my suitcase. Hanging out with my family as much as possible. I'm hoping to go down to Portland on Wednesday to meet up with my good friend from college, Chris, and some other friends who are having a deepening/study on Baha'i writings in the evening. I actually have quite a few other things planned for my remaining days here too.
I was trying to figure out a way to get down to Texas for a day or two during my time here (two of my good friends, Naseem and Greg are getting married), but alas, it could not be done. For any of you who read this and who are going, please take pictures and save me a piece of cake."

"event","When I look back and reflect on the past few years of my life, I see an unending stream of sunshine that almost blinds me. When I reflect, I feel the presence of the souls that have impacted my path through time. The silhouettes of these incredible individuals continually brighten my path, despite the fact that I am thousands of miles away from most of them. 

Recently I have been spending a lot of time reflecting on my time in Chicago and the factors that caused my spiritual growth to progress as it did. My thoughts have led me to two concepts that I perceive to have had a special impact on me during my time in Chicago, Service and Unity-Building. These two concepts are things that I feel have always been important to me in my life, but I think it wasn't until Chicago that I really internalized them into my process of being. 

Service, I have come to recognize, is the most influencial factor that influences my overall happiness in life. In times when I feel that I am rendering service important to the progression of humanity I feel a spirit of joy infused into me, this spirit of joy is recognizably dimmed whenever I am not in the the process of helping to build an ever-advancing world. Before Chicago, service was something I appreciated, after Chicago, service has become the central focus of my actions. Shanghai tested my dedication to this focus, largely because of the quick shift from being constantly surrounded by a community of incredible servants of humanity in Chicago to being mostly alone, often sick, and having a limited sense of community in Shanghai. This shift was difficult at times, but it was evident that the tests laced within these difficulties were having profound effects on my overall spiritual development. Shanghai helped me to internalize a very important realization; tests and trials in life are truly blessings that can help one to personally progress (and this process is greatly enhanced by systematic reflection, and then followed by actions that aim to turn realizations of that reflection process into concrete realities). By seeing the end in the beginning, and not dwelling in the unpleasant things that arise within moments of life, I have been able to better internalize a vision that is beyond just the here and now, and can more easily recognize tests and trials as blessings that are truly helping me to become more than what I have been. I now have a sense of steadfastness that is embedded deeper than ever before. Service has been a prime factor in that process. 

I wanted to spend some time writing about Unity-Building too (to me, this means building bonds of friendship and love that transcend earthly barriers), but my current tiredness has proven to convince me that it is time for me to sleep now. Hopefully I'll write about it more later, because I feel a need to express the depth of the importance my frienships throughout my life have been. I love everyone."

"event","A few days ago I had this great (and very needed) conversation with a couple of my friends about relationships (past ones and hopes for the future). The conversation opened me up to some internal realizations that I believe will be quite important to me in the future. So I wrote a poem:

My heart is aflame
Sparked by hope sustained
Reaching to attain the presence
Of she who remains forever
Within every eternal ember
Floating upward toward the center,

The unknown home from whence it came
Burns with the fire of love unvein
Sending signals in a coded language
Embedded in the unforsaken depths
Where perception intersects the latent
Connections sought since days of ancient.

The placeless intagibility shines
Igniting the path with abstract light
Defused throughout the energy felt
Like a blanket that internally dwells
Surging in rippling waves that tell
The story of how one may feel."

"event","It is due time for an update. So here I am, just call me Updateman, here to swoop into the blog-entry typebox faster than a sprinting turtle and with more energy than a slithering slug. Life is in a chaotic sort of balance right now.

At the moment I am in Beijing taking care of some visa issues. The timing of this trip is spectacular. Let me tell you why. As you probably already know, my parents lived in China for five years and returned to living in the US two or three years ago. Since returning my mom has been building a business selling Chinese antique furniture at various antique malls around Olympia, Portland, and Seattle. Her business has been doing quite well. She has recently sold-out of everything she had originally shipped to the US from China. So she is now on her way back to Beijing to connect with her contacts and buy another large shipment of antique furniture to ship back to the US. She arrives today, in four hours. Originally, the plan for me to see my mom while she was in China was going to be for her to come out to Linfen for her two free days. But as fate would dictate it, it became a requirement for me to come to Beijing to take care of some visa issues. Meaning I am now here in Beijing to pick my mom up from the airport and spend a day and a half with her before I return to my work in Linfen. Then next week she will come out to Linfen for a couple of days. You may be thinking that overall that is quite a short time to see my mom, well let me ease your worry. Just a week and a half after I see my mom in Linfen I will be again returning to Beijing, this time only for a span of a few hours and only for the sake of leaving Beijing by airplane destined to arrive in Seattle, Washington to visit my family for two weeks. It will be great to see them. My family is amazing.

Now that I have expressed what is happening in the present, let me take you on a little journey through the past couple of weeks (AKA my time in Linfen). Linfen is a nice town. It's quiet and quaint. The people are incredibly friendly. The pollution is not wonderful, but it is not nearly as bad as I was expecting (though I have been told that I must wait until winter arrives and then my tune will change, supposedly winter pollution is horrid). It is very visible, but thus far it doesn't create an internal/health issues. In fact, I have been healthier since I arrived in Linfen than I had ever been in Shanghai. I was pretty much at least a little bit sick during my entire time in Shanghai. Sometimes I was very sick (bronchitis, food poisoning, lung issues, etc) and at other times I was just a bit sick (cold symptoms, slight cough, etc), but there was something there at almost all times. When I arrived in Linfen, the first couple of nights I coughed a lot when I was going to bed, so I decided to see a traditional Chinese doctor that resides in Linfen that I have heard is amazing at what she does. I went it and was diagnosed and she discovered that I had an infection in my lungs (which didn't surprise me since I had had a nagging cough for months and months, but interestingly had not been identified by the western hospital I had gone to in Shanghai). She prescriped me some medicine that was a mixture of about a dozen different herbs, plants, nuts, etc that I had to cook twice a day in a special Chinese medicine pot. The resulting liquid that I was to drink was possibly the most un-delicious thing I have ever had the displeasure of intaking, but it really seemed to do the trick. I drank the medicine in the morning and at night for three days and ever since then I have felt as healthy as a marathon runner. 

As far as my work in Linfen is concerned, I have been able to recognize that I am going to absolutely love my job. It is quite slow during the summer, so I have had plently of time to get to know my coworkers, see the city, shop for household necessities, etc, but I have nonetheless been able to recognize that once things pick up a bit I will continue to love every moment. Soon after I arrived I was involved in a three day training getting me more familiar with the teaching materials I will be utilizing. Great moral education and language cirriculum indeed. It feels nice working for an organization focused on serving humanity rather than a company focused on making a lot of money (like the company I was working for in Shanghai). 

Let me take a moment to express to you just how awesome my coworkers are. It is easy to see that a large reason I am going to love my time in Linfen so much is because of the people I will have the pleasure of being surrounded by. I have been in Linfen for less than two weeks and already I feel a profoundly deep connection with many of the people I am working with. We are one happy family. Jeff and Tania are the two people who kind of run things, and they are amazing people. In many ways Jeff (from Michigan) reminds me of an older version of myself (not in all ways of course, but in many). Tania (from Australia) is an incredible individual who is full of so much wisdom and love. They have a nine month old daughter named Sophie. Shabnam (from Malaysia) is the person I have gotten to know the most and spent the most time with, she has been in Linfen for 6 months and will be here for another 18 months, so I am very much looking forward to continuing to build a very strong friendship with her. Sara (from Canada/Taiwan) arrived in Linfen about two days before I left for Beijing, but already I feel a connection with her that is destined to turn into a very strong friendship. You get to know people very well and quite fast when living in a place like Linfen. Rebecca (from Kenya) is an amazing woman strongly dedicated to service. I very much look forward to deepening my friendship with her. Kyle (from Australia) is one of my roommates, he'll be here for another 6 months. He reminds me a lot of a two people I know who I thought I would never find anyone else even close to being like them. He is hilarious. Forrest (from Guangzhou, China) is my other roommate. He is awesome. He is someone I definetly look forward to getting to know better. And that is everyone on the staff that I have met so far. There are a few more people coming in soon who I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting. It is a small group of people, but a closely-knit group of loving and open people. 

Updateman, signing off..."

I feel like I have so many different things going on in my life, (some might say that I am juggling a lot of things, but I don't like this phrase very much) but if I didn't have all of these things my life wouldn't be nearly as rich (aka internally rewarding). Every once in a while an instrument in my orchestra plays a note off-key, but I'm learning how to hear those off-key notes much better these days, and am training those instruments how to play with the right pitch. 
One of the instruments that is having a nice long solo recently is the instrument that symbolizes my musical endeavors. I've been continually making what I consider to be quality music recently. I'm working on collaboration projects with five different people (Emiliano, Ryan (of Common Market), Mtume (of Core Rhythm), Reason (of Word Warriors), and Amy Gandiomi). The projects are still in their infancy stages, but I have full confidence that they will turn out stellar, which in turn brings me lots of inspiration and motivation to work towards that goal. 
Another instrument in my orchestra that has been playing the occasional solo recently is the one that symbolizes my search to find the right grad program. I remember last October I made a list of schools I was going to apply to, spent lots of time researching specific programs, but didn't end up applying to any of them because it just didn't feel like what I was supposed to be doing. As it turned out, remaining in China for at least one more year was the correct decision to make (I feel certain about this), for a few reasons. One, the next step on my journey (rural China, teaching English to 12-15 year olds using a cirriculum encircling the virtues and utilizing the arts), I feel, is a very important service to offer humanity. Two, the next step on my journey is going to be teaching me elements of ngo management and educational development that will inevitably be invaluable to my future. I am going to learn so much. Three, the decision to not apply to a grad program yet was definetly the right decision because as time has progressed I have narrowed in much more directly on the nature of what I want my grad program to be focused on. International educational development. Previously I was just going to apply to education programs, be a teacher for awhile, an administator for awhile, and then eventually perhaps a professor in the field of education. Now I have a growing desire to be more involved in grassroots organization and educational development. I feel like I have had many confirming experiences that have been helping me to direct my focus more and more onto international educational development. 
And for all ya'll who are thinking about applying to grad school, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND looking into schools in Sweden. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Higher education in Sweden is free, even for international students (but this will change in 2008, so get over there now!). Many schools offer many different programs in English. Sweden spends more money per capita on education than any other nation in the world, and the schools are, supposedly, very great learning environments. I'm sure to apply to at least two or three schools in Sweden (although the program I am most attracted to is at NYU, and I've also found great programs at Lesley Uni in Boston, the U of Minnesota-Twin Cities, The New School University in NY, and George Washington Uni in DC... I also found many great programs in the UK, Australia, and Canada, but as an international student I wouldn't be eligable for financial aid of any sort, and that might keep me from applying.)"

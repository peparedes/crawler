"event","It was my first day of class today. Turned out to be pretty good despite the fact that the rain was coming down in huge torrential waves which managed to soak my shoes, socks, and jeans all the way up to mid thigh. Bio promises to be boring. My Hist 346 class looks like it will be good, the professor is absolutely adorable in that grey suit and sweater vest dorky teacher kind of way. He even has the thick black rimmed glasses. He looks so ridiculously proper that (and Hardeep is going to kill me for this) I kept imagining him in leather pants at a rock concert or something crazy like that. Needless to say he cracked me up, though I'm sure the people around me wondered why I was grinning like a lunatic and stifling my laughter. My next Hist 321 teacher seems arrogant, he looks like someone but I can't figure out who. This class looks like it might be more difficult, there are a lot of graduate students in this one but it shouldn't be too bad. Except for teh fact that I have 3 midterms on the same day. Its going to be a hell of a week. After my first 3 classes I had a nice 2 hour break which meant I could go home and put on dry clothes, though when I went out for my Phil 502 class they just got soaked again. Particularly since there was a 3 inch deep puddle at the foot of the stairs leading to the HUM building. I want rain boots dammit, I just can't find any in my size. Besides reorganizing the apartment and searching for a job this weekend rain boots are a priority. All the ones I've found online say they run large and you should order a size down but since they start and 5 and I haven't been able to find kids boots in my size it's turning into quite teh conundrum. Monday should be interesting as I am currently wait listed for my HIst 300 seminar, however I'm second on the list and as long as it's not a small ass classroom I should be able to add just fine. 

Not a bad day except Hardeep went home for the weekend. Oh well lets me get organized on my own time."

"event","If there is one statement I hate most in this world it probably is ""I love you too"". Now don't get me wrong, ""I love you"" is one of the most amazing, wonderful things that can come out of someones mouth but I hate that TOO. It is the most undemonstrative word in the entire english language. Unfortunately it seems, particularly in this day and age, that such exuberant phrase like, I love you completely, entirely, and wholeheartedly do not leap easily off the tongue. I can't stand how completely unresponsive the phrase I love you too, makes me feel. Particularly when it's coming out of my mouth. Yes I know how rediculous this entire post is but I feel like this is something worth writing about. Or rather I felt like it was worth writing about last night but was too lazy to get my butt out of bed and type this out."

"event","It's been a while since I've bothered to write anything down, I don't know why, it just seems like nothing is really all that interesting right now. School is going well yadda yadda ya, blah blah blah, why do I even bother with this bullshit. God I sound like Hardeep in all of his old entries about how he was going to delete his journal but never did. I guess LJ sort of died, fucking myspace. There was a lot I wanted to say, none of which I remember right now. ehhhh, whatever. 

I guess the biggest thing in my life is that I decided I want to go to SFSU next year. I'm excited, I've always loved San Francisco, it reminds me of my grandmother and how much she loved living in SF and all the things she use to do and the plays and the places she would take me to. How she always wanted to take my family to the cheesecake factory but never did because the waiting time was always 2 or 3 frickin hours. It still makes me smile and think about it everytime I go to the cheesecake factory. Weird, it's the odd things that you remember. 


But yeah not much to really talk about I suppose. Oh well"

I know that this is not true since I went to Tahoe this weekend with Hardeep and his family but it still feels so monotonous I just want to scream. I think everyone at work does, it seems like everyone is stressed out and wants to quit. It's Print's fault, honestly I know this sounds like the usual worker grumbling but it's true. They haven't been able to keep anyone for a long period of time since Print became manager. He's such an ass. 

Oh well enough grumbling. I'm off tomorrow, I fully intend on enjoying it."

"event","I, Amanda Gonzalez, for the first time last night, ate canned corned beef. I have to say, it was all Pat's idea. Really I don't know why I listened to the stoner but I did it. And apparently my stomach doesn't like me for it. It didn't taste too bad actually, really salty but mix that with the corn, rice, and eggs and it wasn't too bad until later. And really my stomach isn't too upset just every once in awhile it will remind me I should never do that again.

"event","I washed a shit load of dishes today...actually let's start from the beginning.

Woke up and hung out for awhile and then went with Hardeep to the airport, got him all dropped off. Then came back to the apartment and sat around for awhile. Then I went to Ala Moana, ended up not getting anything, so I went to Walmart. Where I passed the ridiculously foul smelling man rolling a joint. Bought some stuff, I'm trying not to spend too much on food this week since it is just me and I want to be able to spend some money comfortably the rest of the week. Came home and did the shit load of dishes that just seemed to keep piling up when there were 13 of us living in the apartment for the last 2 weeks. It was gross but I figure it is the beginning of spring break and there are only 4 of us here now and Nick and I use specific dishes so we'll be able to tell if somebody doesn't do their dishes. And now I am tired and debating taking a shower but Hardeep's plane should be touching down soon and he said he'd call so I think I'll wait for that. And Pat wants to drink tonight so I'll see how that goes. I dunno if I feel like puking since Hardeep's not here to sit with me in the bathroom...lol so I probably will have a few sips and that will be it. I think my current aversion to alcohol stems from the fact that I really don't like not being in some semblence of control and not remembering things. Yeah it's funny to be told I'm a cute drunk but when I don't remember the majority of the night...well there is something not quite right there. So yeah I think most of my dislike is my body telling me what my mind already knows. I don't like getting wasted so the most I can take is a little bit. 

Yes this is entirely random.

And I am trying to plan out my week so I have things to do everyday until Hardeep gets home. Basically that means work, Mon, Tue, Wed, and Fri. Which leaves tomorrow and Thur as my days to go to Pearlridge with Pat and to go to my dorm and drop off some of the clothes I don't wear often and check my mail, oh and I need to do laundry at some point, maybe Wed night since I get off at 6 that day. Those will pretty much be all day ventures so I think I'll be good for keeping myself occupied.

Not to mention I do have a bit of homework which it wouldn't hurt to do now."

"event","After reading Ericka's post about how good a day she's having I decided to join in with one of my own. The day actually started out with Hardeep waking me up by saying, Amanda it's 8:43 (our first class starts at 9:10 and it takes us like 20 minutes to get there by bus) to which I replied, then I say we should go back to sleep or something like that. So we didn't go to writing...bad us. Then we were going to go to burger king to get breakfast but we ended up not getting out of bed until like 10:10 and our next class started at 10:50. So we left at 10:30 and were late, I had a midterm in math but even with being late I was still one of the first 3 to finish. So I got out of class 45 minutes early and wandered around, bought a soda and a granola bar (aren't I healthy?) and got my transcript sent to JHU to apply to be a CTY RA. The application is already late but I might as well try. After that I waited around for Hardeep's class to get out and then went to American Politics which was slightly amusing as usual. Got to talk with Kristine which is always fun. I miss working with her. She got shopped the other day but her drink was too cold so they didn't get 100. bleh to snapshots. After class I went and got my application sent, then went to safeway to pick up dinner. I much prefer safeway to star market. The woman at the register just about made my day. I asked for 10 dollars cash back and as many quarters as I could possibly get (normally they won't give you any more than $2) and so she went and opened her change machine and gave me all 10 in quarters. She was so nice it made me happy I went to Safeway. Yes I am a loser but whatever. So yes that woman made me happy, and the woman at the bus stop made me mad. She grabbed her little boy by the arms and basically threw him into the stroller. I don't even know what he did to piss her off so much but that was after she grabbed the little girl out of the stroller and pushed her out of the way and yelled at them both. Some people just shouldn't be allowed to be near childern, much less have them."

"event","So finals started today (well not for me, but my damn alarm went off at 6:30 so he could get his ass to biology ontime) it's almost one and I just woke up again. Man am I lazy, I use to not be able to sleep past nine here...actually that was at my dorm, I could always sleep later here and considering I didn't get to bed until after one last night I suppose it's understandable. A little at least. Me and Nick went to 711 last night at like midnight. It was fun, he is my 711 buddy most of the time. Mostly because it's scary going there alone at night and Hardeep doesn't like it when I do. So I have my first final tomorrow, communications, I don't like that class anymore. We have to do laundry today, we meant to do it when he got back from his final but I was still asleep and he just got back into bed with me. So my plans for today are...nothing other than laundry. How sad. I shall be home in less than a week. That is odd. I am going to freeze when I get back to california. I've realized that I have no problem spending large amounts of money on other people but when it comes to me I can't stand it when other people buy me things, Hardeep had a hell of a time buying my purse because I wanted another one and this wallet but of course I couldn't stand him buying me all three things so I finally ended up with one of the purses which I think was also more practical because it's bigger than the one I originally wanted. I do love it a lot, it's the perfect size, I can fit just about everything in there. My blue wallet, my phone, my ipod, lotion, a compact, my jumpdrive and a pen. Hehe I love my ipod

PS 
I just got back from 711 again and was locked out, which reminded me that last night Nick and I got locked out because their roommates were smoking pot again, I don't know why this is relevant but it is."

"event","I just realized, I really don't have any friends here. Obviously I have Hardeep and my roommates and to an extent his roommates but other than that there's no one. Honestly it doesn't bother me, back home it would have but here I'm so busy with work and little errands that take  up copious amounts of time because of long stretches sitting, waiting for the bus. I guess it's also the way I view things. At home I hated to do things alone, here I do most things alone. It's odd, you'd think I'd feel more isolated. And sometimes I do, waiting for the bus or shuttle and seeing people talk to their friends but most of the time I don't notice. Maybe it's my only childness coming out but I find that I enjoy doing things by myself.

On another note, this is why I love my Oceanography class so much (other than it gets cancelled all the time)

Quotes from my teacher Gary:

""and this is a magnetic field not a huge ass""
""what we're going to do is look at density...are you in my class?""
""I don't know about you but I can't stand being in an elevator I sure as hell ain't going 31,000 feet beneath the ocean, not without a shitload of valium""
""we've had 4 or 5 classes in a row, as far as I'm concerned that's good""
""it's worthless for this class but I just like it because it's called the Bore-Stoner Orbital model"""

Before you take a swing
I wonder
What are we fighting for
When I say out loud
I want to get out of this
I wonder
Is there anything I'm going to miss
I wonder How it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it going to be
When there is no one to talk to, between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like...
The hammocks by the doorway we spent time in
Swings empty, don't see lightning like last fall when it was
always
about to hit
me
I wonder how's it going to be when it goes down
Hows it going to be
When your not around
Hows it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be.
Hows it going to be
When you don't know me any more
And how's it going to be
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
Wanna taste the soul of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion
Oblivion
How's it going to be
When you don't know me any more
How's it going to be
How's it going to be</i>"

"event","honestly today has a been a good day and it's only 2:30 in the afternoon. Well actually it started out really shitty, I was late for my first day of work. I woke up at frickin 4 in the morning to make sure I got on the 4:53 bus and it never came. It made me so mad and stressed. (oh by the way if any of you talk to my parents no mentioning the working the morning shift ok?) But I got to work and clocked in and Jon showed me around the store, he's cool and funny. Granted I my be a little bit biased since he's the one that interviewed me and said he was giving  me a good recommendation. He's also very cheerful and smiley which irritates me in some people but not him. One of the girls I work with Yu-Ling, or however the heck you spell her name, is also pretty funny. One of my jobs today was to switch the coffee pots and start brewing a new batch and the pots are kind of heavy and up a little higher than is comfortable for me and really hot so at one point I was going to switch one pot and she's like, I'll switch it for you, you're so little, and all that. Normally I would attribute that to the helpless female vibe I seem to give off to guys but she's a chick and it doesn't usually work on them. I say work on them as if I have any control over it, some people just seem to have the need to not let me do things. Heh, oh well I'm lazy. But yeah back to what makes today good other than very cool people at work (though the manager seems kind of uptight. Woohoo I've got very good signal strength, sorry I'm on my laptop and have been having a bad time with my connection. Anywho, so yeah the other day I got an email from the business office saying I've got refund check waiting for me in the buisness office. Now I thought that was for the housing refund but it wasn't cause the housing refund is only 400 dollars, which is a lot of money but I got a check for a little over 1000 dollars! Which is totally awesome and I could totally use the money, and that not just because I love shopping but I need to get more work clothes. And I have to buy lunch everyday. OMG I am madly in love with Subway. You just don't understand the depths of my Subway adoration, 6-inch roasted chicken breast on parmesian oregano bread. I would say that it is 6-inches of heaven in my mouth but I have a dirty mind and will refrain and simply say that Subway is awesome and will make me go broke.

There was something else I wanted to say but can't think of it so I'll end here."

<br>
Maybe it's just me but I think that's frickin awesome, especially
considering I'm almost penniless right now. I spent my last bit of cash
on lunch today because I was sooooo hungry and forgot to bring my
pudding :( and I believe I have all of 32 dollars in my account, so
don't try to steal my identity, believe me you don't want it. Oh yeah
forgot to tell you where I am now employed:Starbucks. Which I know
Ericka thinks is Evil (notice the mad capitalization) but she's a freak
and still shops at Walmart so she can't talk...I loves you! Gah! I'm
really excited. They were interviewing this other person when I came in
so I was really afraid I wouldn't get the job but they called me up
like 20 minutes after I left to tell me I was hired. If I wasn't
standing in the middle of Fort Street I probably would have done a jump
for joy but I didn't. I'm already a loner, no need to make people think
I'm a freak too. But yeah I have buttloads of homework so g'night."

"event","well it's 5:40 on sunday night and I haven't started my homework yet. Ok so I don't really have any homework, just some french questions that, if need be I can whip out before  class tomorrow since it doesn't start till 11:25. And OMG Amanda has a job interview TOMORROW!!! ok, it's not really that exciting but I have no money right now and would really like some so yeah, interview at Starbucks tomorrow at 10 am which means I'm getting on the 8:30 shuttle to get there ontime. I'm rather excited, the prospect of being able to shop again thrills me beyond belief :) So yeah, all in all my first week of school has been rather cool. No I didn't mean to write that cheesy rhyme, it just came out that way.Yesterday was fun, went and saw the Brothers Grimm with Hardeep then we ate dinner at Cheeseburger in paradise, hehe, then I did my first totally random thing. Ericka, I'm sorry I haven't called you I'm just not sure <i>when</i> to call you or anything but we soooo need to talk. Basically I've been wandering around with Lesliam just trying to get my bearings. Right now I'm waiting for the people to get their damn laundry done so I can have clean clothes again. Not to mention clean bedding. Ok, I'm online now so thats enough of this. Toodles."

"event","So it's 7 in the morning, the dinning commons (DC) doesn't open until 7:30 and I don't feel like putting makeup on today, or at least right now so I'll write this. If you know me than you're probably saying to yourself, wow Amanda up before she has to be. Yes, I have been up since 6:30 I have to shower and do all that crap and my roommate Tiffin gets up even earlier than me so I don't know if I'll have to wait for the shower or not. On another totally random note, I'm going to have such nice legs when I get back I might even run if its not raining out, though being December it probably will. So I dropped my Theater class, we were going to be reading Oedipus, Death of a Salesman, and Tartuffe (the first 2 I could have dealt with but Tartuffe...). It was also going to be really writing and literature based which is fine except I already am taking Honors Literature and Argument, though I'm not sure how it differs from Hardeep's Literature and Argument class which is right after mine and he received the same homework, whatever. MY Oceanography teacher is funny, he is a pilot with the Air Force Auxiliary and said that he would take students up if they split the cost of the plane with him. We're also going to have several Friday classes where he's interviewing several students and he told us to go to the beach. MY running shoes still have sand in them from the day we went to Diamond Head and then walked along the beach, they also feel sticky, probably from the salt water which bugs me. I guess I'll throw them in the laundry this weekend. I think I've basically bought everything I need except snack wise. If we ever find the bus route to Costco I'll be set, I'm applying for several jobs, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, Macys, and possibly the Spaghetti Factory. My dad said to wait but I really want spending money. Anyway, breakfast starts soon so Toodles! And hi to all the people I haven't talked to."

"event","so yeah first day of class and I'm exhausted. Woke up at 6:30 so I
could get ready and eat breakfast before catching the 7:45 shuttle. I
made the mistake of going and getting the rest of my books before class
started so I had to lug around all my english and communication stuff
in addition to about 15 pounds of french and theater books. genius I
tell you but whatever I survived. saw Hardeep briefly after my lit and
argument class then rushed off to find my com class which is absolutely
packed. 27 of us crammed into this tiny room and it's an honors class
so I'm guessing not alot of people will be dropping. my theatre teacher
reminds me of raven, but blonde which is kind of funny. she described
herself as loud, opinionated, and somewhat sarcastic and I was thinking
""gee must be a requirement to teach theatre""<br>
<br>
it's kind of sad, I'm in hawaii and it's beautiful and all but I'm
walking around in this thick brown sweater which I love but it's still
sad, you'd think I wouldn't have to wear stuff like that here. it's a
good thing that that I decided not to go to school in Buffalo. But
yeah. I've got homework to do so toodles, hope you all are enjoying life<br>"

"event","well I'm here in Hawaii (just in case you didn't know) my legs ache like hell cuz Hardeep made me go on the damn Diamond Head hike yesterday then we swam out to this reef and got battered on the rocks and crap. other than that it's been good, my parents have been annoying but what else is new? they're leaving on sunday morning so I'm either moving into my dorm friday night or saturday. I've only met one roommate so far, her names Lesliam, she seems pretty cool unfortunately she's a neat freak (who the hell put us in the same room?!?). I don't know about the other girl. Apparently the place hardeeps living in is really shitty, I haven't seen it yet since my parents are doing everything in their power to keep us apart until they leave. who cares though we're going to be here together for the next 4 months so haha. :) yes I'm weird and all that. still gotta get my books and crap, I don't know what kind of supplies I'll be needing so I haven't bought any binders or anything Ericka I'm going to miss you when I do go by everything :(

ok well I must be going, hope everyone is doing well, save your money so you can come visit me!

"event","hehe, I decided I love Dog the Bounty Hunter. It's a funny show, and they're based in Hawaii, in Honolulu (I think) which is cool. The dude's got 12 kids with like 4 different woman and likes to vacuum.

On a different yet still slightly amusing note:

So my mom and I were deciding what I need to bring with me and I hold up my only remaining padded bra and say somewhat jokingly ""think I should bring this?"" and my mom looks at it and says ""sure just in case you and hardeep break up and you need to pick up some other guy""

I saw Nicki at Safeway today.

My mom thought she lost her drivers liscense, which she actually did. She left it at Walmart, the woman's going absolutely bonkers I swear.

"event","so I substituted for my mom's bunco group thingy tonight. it was interesting. I passed out in the hallway, fell partly through my doorway and bonked my head on the doorframe. mary suggested I see a doctor. I'm inclined to agree with her.

oh I finally got my laptop today but we don't have a wireless router so I may be spending quite a bit of time at hardeep's stealing his internet since I have no money to buy one and am leaving in a week anyway.

talked to cammie today, it was cool we're going out to lunch monday."

Will I ever finish it? How about the sequel to Evans Blue? What about the other 5-7 short story plots I came up with, all wickedly morbid in their own manners?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">I feel like dewelling into the plots. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">Fuck fuck FUCK! I can't find what I did with the damn plots! *lip trembles* Must find the god damn PAPER. Grr. This infuriates me!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">I can only remember two..okay, THREE of the plots. One was about a resturaunt feeding people to the customers. And a health inspector came in, and found out what they were up to. So they made him write a false report, and then killed him and put him the daily stew or something.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">Brings new meaning to cooking from ""scratch"" eh? Wow I'm sick.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">Anywho. Then another one was the sequel to Evans Blue. Involves Luke's past haunting him--causing him to go over the edge. Gets in a car wreck (driving drunk) and the last thing he sees befoer he dies is the lifeless eyes of the people just killed.&nbsp; That's Blackholes.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">And then there's the one (my favorite along side Evans Blue, for some odd reason. Then again, I love them all). <br />A woman has a sex change and starts killing all these little girls. It goes into detail about the last murder before she/he's caught. Then the police ask why, and the reader finds out the woman was abused as a child by her father because he never considered her perfect like the other little girls that lived around them and such. And the little girls she killed, were ""perfect"". </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#cc33cc"">Yeah. I'm so weird. Esepcially since I LOVE writing from the killers POV.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">WAIT!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">I think another one of them had something to do with a person having a disease that makes them need human blood to live (makes them vampish). So it goes on about how this person found animal blood and blood bank blood only partially quenching, so they killed someone for the animalistic thrill, and for the first taste of rich, warm, fresh from the source blood.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Ho. I remembered one. Go me!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Must find that damn paper still.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Lets see: *Evans Blue, *Blackholes, * Blood Roses (all * are permanent names)</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Fatal Cravings, Daddy's Little Defect, ""Acquired"" Taste,&nbsp; and what not.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Anybody have any better suggestions, I'm all ears. And hear and skin and organs, but whatever. I'm shutting up now. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Quick note: </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">The Classic Crime= kick ass band</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#66cccc"">Doctor Who + Bones=Wonderful shows.

"event","<p><strong><font color=""#ffcc66"">My lovely blog/rant about my ""Happy"" Thanksgiving.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc66"">Oh god. Get some popcorn.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc66"">Tuesday--My grandpa, Betty and I left Rolla. I drove to Tulsa--but there was a wreck on the I-44 turn off, so we had to stop and stay in Tulsa for the night.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc66"">Turns out a semi swerved, ran into an Amber alert sign, flipped into a ditch and caught fire, killing the driver. So we stayed at the Cherokee Casino &amp; Resort.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">Fuck, that was a nice place! Nice, smooshy beds, hot water...I coulda gambled if I wanted to...but it's like I told my mom:<br />""It's like a rock concert. Minus the rock music.""<br />No really. Its loud, smoky, there's booze everywhere, and you lose money. Except at concerts you lose money to band merch and food, not to stupid machines. And they were playing country music. God save my ears. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">&nbsp;So I went upstairs and watched the new House that came on.&nbsp;I missed NCIS. *sob* Thank cheese for DVR. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">Wednesday--Up at the crack of dawn, duh. That's my grandpa. ""I see <br />sunlight, lets go!!"" <br />Me:&nbsp;""Waaa...naaaa sleeeeeep. Nooo driveeeypie.""</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">I didnt sleep well. B/w cramps and the bulldozers in the room (Betty and grandpa) and the fact that at 3:30am I woke up to them talking--<br />Betty: What's that?<br />Grandpa: What?<br />B: That green light there?<br />G: What green light?<br />B:Maybe I'm seeing things...No there it was again!<br />*five minutes later as they go on like this*<br />Me: It's&nbsp;a smoke detector.<br />Betty:...Oh yeah. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">So much for a good nights rest.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">Wednesday--After having a yummy breakfast (potato doobers, ham, and cheese, oh score) we took off for NM. Amarillo still rocks btw. Minus the constant road construction. About 6 or so we made it to NM. It took long enough. I trounced my&nbsp; mom, who saw us parking. She was all smiles. Nearly made me cry in public.<br />Took two trips to get all my crap upstairs. <br />We then went out for dinner at the restaraunt next door,&nbsp;and then retired to our seperate rooms. My mom and I then went to Walmart. Where we got way too much food in comparison to her dinky frig. Snort. I got a tub of ice cream. Damn pms hormones! </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">Thursday--We had breakfast at...um...well, I don't know. I slept in. My mom took them out. I was soooo tired. Like now! GAH!<br />Anywho--we ate at some off the wall restaraunt. It was okay. Not exactly the thanksgiving dinner I look forward to, but my mom was there, so it was all good.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">Then while the others napped, I played Sims. Great fun. <br />Sort of. <br />Then we ate uh. Where did we eat for dinner? Oh god! I forgot!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">We ate that's all that matters. O.O</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">Soo. Uhm. Shit. Then what did we do. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">OH RIGHT! We got soup for my grandpa, and some chips and nacho stuff and made nachos. Yeah. Happy turkey day nachos.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">Go us.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">At least there was a hot latino at walmart. Mrawr.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">The toilet in my mom's apartment got stopped up somehow. We couldnt fix it.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#009900"">NEXT DAY!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">*blink blink*</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">Friday--We had&nbsp; spic N span for breakfast. Good stuff. I got an eclair. I didn't eat the whole thing though--it was friggin huge!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">Then we were going to go to Santa Fe, but Betty didn't feel well (she was sick before we left home, but wanted to go). So she and grandpa rested at the hotel. My mom and I shopped around town, and watched a movie. Talked, caught up, etc. SNUGGLED! Mom snuggles are the best. Moving on. There was a lot of crying going on, since that was my last day there and all. And before I forget *waggles eyebrows*</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#99ff99"">My mom and I took some coffee and cake down to my grandpa and Betty,&nbsp; there was this hot latino in the hallway...in nothing but a towel. HELL YES! My day got better, let me tell you. He just got out of the shower, was all wet, and sexy and...*drool* <br />Shit, the keyboard. Where was I? Right! AND BUILT! BUILT LADIES AND GENTLEABS!<br />He was so embarassed. He needed his suit from his friend's room. Ha. HAHAH! HOT! My mom knew the look on my face before she even turned around. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">Sheer bliss. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">And a minor bit of drool. :D</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">WOOHOO!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">Then I saw him again--they left the door open, and he had pants on, but no shirt and and...</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">MORE DROOL!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">YEEEEE!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">There was a wedding that night down stairs. Right under my mom's apartment. My god, the reception was so fucking loud! The friggin band played all night long! I WANTED TO STAB SOMEONE!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">At least the bleeping toilet got fixed. 3 plungers, a bottle of draino and a professional later, the toilet was fixed. The plungers and the Draino were my mom and I's attempt to fix it. This didn't work. The plumber added something that caused a chemical reaction that stank up the entire hotel, so we had to stay out for...oh a few hours. Snort. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">That was great. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffff99"">At least the toilet works!!!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc99"">Saturday--We left that&nbsp; morning. My mom and I cried and hugged a lot. I tried not to. Gotta be the wall you know. But I couldn't help it. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc99"">She cried the rest of the day--I know it. She cried everytime I called/she called. God I miss her. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc99"">We made it to Joplin, Missouri before stopping. I wanted to go all the way to Springfield, but gramps wouldn't let me. *glare*</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc99"">So today Sunday we drove the 200 miles home. After eating. I hate a waffle with strawberries and whip cream! Big no no. Did it anyway. Dee dee dee. So I'll have nodules later. Cuz I'm not sick yet. Ho joy. WHAT! There wasn't anything else I could eat!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#ffcc99"">So I have some homework and laundry to do. I missed my babies. Those little buggers worth of cats mean a lot to ickle ol' me. As do my online buds. I've missed them all!

"event","A loverly summary of me and my trip to the hellhole New Mexico.

 Don't read. Unless you want to.

Day one: Wow. Get 'em move 'em out raw hide. Damn my mom owns a lot of stuff. And I own even more than her! Can you imagine moving me?! After cramming both the camaro and SUV full of her stuff, we took off. We drove and drove until Tulsa, Oklahoma and then had to stop for the night.
Naturally my dad picked a shitty hotel. And I made it a point to let him know just how shitty it was...every five minutes. I shared a bed with my mom. Who snores. And crowds. B/w her and my dad snoring, and the traffic on the highway, I wound up with only 4 hours of sleep, most of which happened on the floor. 

Day two: We drove. All day. Until 9. All the way to bloody Las Vegas, New Mexico. Do not mistake this for Las Vegas, Neveda, sin city--the city that never sleeps. No. Not even close. More like a Rolla sized trailer park complete with 3 pizza huts, 2 DQs, and a walmart. That's it. It's horrible! I'd shoot myself if I had to live out there! 

Especially since they don't even have ONE half way decent radio station that you can pick up! 

We stopped in Amarillo, Texas to eat lunch. At Olive Garden, we met a band, who ate right next to us (and witnessed me (unknowingly) dancing to Buckcherry's ""Crazy Bitch"" for my mom)--the Black Crows. That was pretty cool. I like Amarillo. I'm considering moving there now. Hmmm.

Within five minutes of seeing my moms apartment, I was already finding her a new place to stay. Come on! My room is probably bigger than the apartment! I'm going to buy her a pit bull--seriously. Crime out there is five times the national average. I passed numerous cars littered with bullet holes--most with chrome paint around them so they stood out. 

They're damn proud of them bullet holes, them mexicans, ummhmm. *snort*

Since the mattress sucked, and there wasn't enough room for all of us, my mom and I (during our excertion out at Walmart) bought a blow up mattress. Damn that thing was fun! I sumersaulted, flipped, flopped, and bounced all over the damn thing! My mom slept with me, so that was interesting..*flops right into a table* Ow. 

My dad sat on it and flipped me off. So I flipped him off. With my two middle fingers, my middle toes, as well as my moms. HA! Take that assholio!

But it was pretty dang cozy. Plus, I tought my mom how to play inkball, which was definitely entertaining to watch. :p I love her so much. God. 
How will I survive, seriously?

Day three: My mom and I drove the 70 something miles to Santa Fe. It's not all that great. Kinda like St. Louis, made of adobe and dirt. Yeah. The mall had the smallest Hot Topic I've ever bloody seen! Luckily, I still got a Three Days Grace and Red Jump Suit Appartus tshirts out of it. And I bought Kay and Izzy a reindeer and santa claus hat from PetSmart. That'll be great to see. Haha!

Then when we got back to LV, we had to go to Walmart, since we forgot to buy a phone the night before, plus a few other things

THEN when I got to the apartment, I tried setting up the webcam I got my mom. Only to find out her Wifi wasn't. So we had to go buy a wifi card. On the outside of Radioshack it says ""We sell wifi at this location."" So we ask the guy inside for a wifi card for the computer.
""We don't sell wifi.""
Me & mom: *blink*
*looks to other guy that works there* ""We don't sell that do we?""
""Are you stupid? Of course we do, idiot. *rolls eyes*""
Me + mom: *snort*

It only took forever to get the damn thing. Then once it was set up, we found out the building didn't have an ISP, so my mom has to wait until next week to get one. *rolls eyes* Good god. 

The culture out there is set back by ...I don't know, a million years? Has the big bang even happened for them yet? Gawd. Seriously. All the teens hang out at Walmart like it's the place to be. Go home! Get and education! Get a job! Something! You people irritate me!

Yeah--well LV looks better at night, lets just go with that. You cant see all the muck that is the ""city"" in the dark. 

That night my dad and I left for home. Leaving was the hardest part. It nearly killed me to walk away from my mom. She'd been crying since the previous week, so this just made it harder. I couldn't cry though. I haven't figured out why. Probably because if I do, I'll make myself violently ill, and I already can't take that with as sick as I already am. Yeah

I had to consume gluten on my trip since that's all there pretty much is out there. So now I'm having a celiac's attack. My stomach hurts, my joints have nodules in them, and I feel like I've been hit by a fucking semi. Geez. 

BTTP: We were suppose to drive all the way home that night, but naturally we didnt. I drove 200 something miles, then my dad drove like...50, then stopped. I was too tired to drive anymore, since I hadn't gotten any sleep. So we stayed at another shitty motel. One with mildewy tubs, smelled of smoke (cuz of course the only available room was smoking). And they didn't have shampoo. Which I needed. Yick.

Day four: I drove from Shamrock, NM, all the way to Joplin, MO. That's a long way. I nearly got us killed. I fell asleep and drove into a cement block from construction. Luckily the car just bounced off of it without causing any damage. That's why I switched my dad on driving duties. 

Ahem. What?! I had had about 4 hours of sleep again, and was driving in bad weather most of the day, which took a lot of concentration and steering control.

At least in Oklahoma City I stopped and had IHop for breakfast. Where I saw the most gorgeous male ever. Short black hair, dark skin, dark brown eyes, tall, built....very mrrawr. And his voice---when he came over to talk to my dad and I about the weather (since he wasn't our waiter, dammit. Would've slipped him my number or something....:p nah)---was like silk to my ears. God damn! I could have jumped the guy right then and there! In a very crowded restaraunt! IN THE MORNING!

GAH!

Where's a camera when you need one? Dammit. He was fine. Lemme tell you.

Phew. Broke a sweat just thinking about him. Lol :p 

We made it home Sunday by about 5. I was so tired it wasn't even funny.
My dad supposedly made him self ill over leaving my mom in NM by herself, she was all arthritic and supposedly couldn't walk the entire way home. He gimped and bitched and what not. He's still like that. So when I got home, I had to unpack all of his crap along with my own. And get dinner. And clean the bits of the house that was left a mess.. 

Monday I didn't go to school, cos I felt like complete and utter shit. I still do, but I'm trying not to miss. I slept until 11:00am then got up. I got my school work, went to walmart, go lunch, and did homework, all while my dad did nothing. And I was fucking miserable. I still am. My feet are killing me.

So that in total is my shitty weekend journey.

I miss my mom. We're close--too damn close to be this far apart. She keeps crying on the phone, and I still can't seem to. Maybe because I feel I need to be strong for her. But I know I'm hurting myself by keeping it pent up. I've caught myself picking again, which sucks big hairy balls, especially since I finally quit. So this sucks. 

I'm tired. Hungry. Have homework to do. And have to take out trash.

Someone cheer me up.

"event","<p><strong><font color=""#008080"">A loverly summary of me and my trip to the hellhole New Mexico.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Don't read. Unless you want to.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080""><em>Day one:</em> Wow. Get 'em move 'em out raw hide. Damn my mom owns a lot of stuff. And I own even more than her! Can you imagine moving me?!&nbsp; After cramming both the camaro and SUV full of her stuff, we took off.&nbsp;&nbsp;We drove and drove until Tulsa, Oklahoma and then had to stop for the night.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Naturally my dad picked a shitty hotel. And I made it a point to let him know just how shitty it was...every five minutes. I shared a bed with my mom. Who snores. And crowds. B/w her and my dad snoring, and the traffic on the highway, I wound up with only 4 hours of sleep, most of which happened on the floor. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080""><em>Day two:</em> We drove. All day. Until 9. All the way to bloody Las Vegas, New Mexico. Do not mistake this for Las Vegas, Neveda, sin city--the city that never sleeps. No. Not even close. More like a Rolla sized trailer park complete with 3 pizza huts, 2 DQs, and a walmart.&nbsp; That's it. It's horrible! I'd shoot myself if I had to live out there! Especially since they don't even have ONE half way decent radio station&nbsp; that you can pick up! </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">We stopped in&nbsp;Amarillo, Texas to eat lunch.&nbsp;At Olive Garden, we met a band, who ate right next to us (and witnessed me (unknowingly) dancing to Buckcherry's ""Crazy Bitch"" for my mom)--the Black&nbsp;Crows. That was pretty cool. I like Amarillo. I'm considering moving there now. Hmmm.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Within five minutes of seeing my moms apartment, I was already finding her a new place to stay. Come on! My room is probably bigger than the apartment! I'm going to buy her a pit bull--seriously. Crime out there is five times the national average. I passed numerous cars littered with bullet holes--most with chrome paint around them so they stood out. They're damn proud of them bullet holes, them mexicans, ummhmm. *snort*</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Since the mattress sucked, and there wasn't enough room for all of us, my mom and I (during our excertion out at Walmart) bought a blow up mattress. Damn that thing was fun! I sumersaulted, flipped, flopped, and bounced all over&nbsp; the damn thing! My mom slept with me, so that was interesting..*flops right into a table* Ow. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">My dad sat on it and flipped me off. So I flipped him off. With my two middle fingers, my middle toes, as well as my moms. HA! Take that assholio!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">But it was pretty dang cozy. Plus, I tought my mom how to play inkball, which was definitely entertaining to watch. :p I love her so much. God. How will I survive, seriously?</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080""><em>Day three: </em>My mom and I drove the 70 something miles to Santa Fe. It's not all that great. Kinda like St. Louis, made of adobe and dirt. Yeah. The mall had the smallest Hot Topic I've ever bloody seen! Luckily, I still got a Three Days Grace and Red Jump Suit Appartus tshirts out of it. And I bought Kay and Izzy a reindeer and santa claus hat from PetSmart. That'll be great to see. Haha!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Then when we got back to LV, we had to go to Walmart, since we forgot to buy a phone the night before, plus a few other things</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">THEN when I got to the apartment, I tried setting up the webcam I got my mom. Only to find out her Wifi wasn't. So we had to go buy a wifi card. On the outside of Radioshack it says ""We sell wifi at this location."" So we ask the guy inside for a wifi card for the computer.<br />""We don't sell wifi.""<br />Me &amp; mom: *blink*<br />*looks to other guy that works there* ""We don't sell that do we?""<br />""Are you stupid? Of course we do, idiot. *rolls eyes*""<br />Me + mom: *snort*</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">It only took forever to get the damn thing. Then once it was set up, we found out the building didn't have an ISP, so my mom has to wait until next week to get one. *rolls eyes* Good god. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">The culture out there is set back by ...I don't know, a million years? Has the big bang even happened for them yet? Gawd. Seriously. All the teens hang out at Walmart like it's the place to be. Go home! Get and education! Get a job! Something! You people irritate me!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Yeah--well LV looks better at night, lets just go with that. You cant see all the muck that is the ""city"" in the dark. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">That night my dad and I left for home. Leaving was the hardest part. It nearly killed me to walk away from my mom. She'd been crying since&nbsp;the previous week, so this just made it harder. I couldn't cry though. I haven't figured out why. Probably because if I do, I'll make myself violently ill, and I already can't take that with as sick as I already am. Yeah</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">I had to consume gluten on my trip since that's all there pretty much is out there. So now I'm having a celiac's attack. My stomach hurts, my joints have nodules in them, and I feel like I've been hit by a fucking semi. Geez. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">BTTP: We were suppose to drive all the way home that night, but naturally we didnt. I drove 200 something miles, then my dad drove like...50, then stopped. I was too tired to drive anymore, since I hadn't gotten any sleep. So we stayed at another shitty motel. One with mildewy tubs, smelled of smoke (cuz of course the only available room was smoking). And they didn't have shampoo. Which I needed. Yick.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080""><em>Day four:</em>&nbsp; I drove from Shamrock, NM, all the way to Joplin, MO. That's a long way. I nearly got us killed. I fell asleep and drove into a cement block from construction. Luckily the car just bounced off of it without causing any damage. That's why I switched my dad on driving duties. Ahem. What?! I had had about 4 hours of sleep again, and was driving in bad weather most of the day, which took a lot of concentration and steering control.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">At least in Oklahoma City I stopped and had IHop for breakfast. Where I saw the most gorgeous male ever.&nbsp; Short black hair, dark skin, dark brown eyes, tall, built....very mrrawr. And his voice---when he came over to talk to my dad and I about the weather (since he wasn't our waiter, dammit. Would've slipped him my number or something....:p nah)---was like silk to my ears. God damn! I could have jumped the guy right then and there! In a very crowded restaraunt! IN THE MORNING!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">GAH!</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">Where's a camera when you need one? Dammit. He was fine. Lemme tell you. Phew. Broke a sweat just thinking about him. Lol :p </font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">We made it home Sunday by about 5. I was so tired it wasn't even funny.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font color=""#008080"">My dad supposedly made him self ill over leaving my mom in NM by herself, she was all arthritic and supposedly couldn't walk the entire way home.

"event","Wow. Where does one begin?

The beginning I suppose. That would make sense. But I don't like making sense.

So I'll start in the middle. Oooh! A sandwich!

Haha.

Okay. Yesterday both rocked my face off, and sucked ass.

First, I shall start with the face rocking.

Though we had to stand in an effing long line, it was still sooo worth it. The opening act was alright--luckily there was really only one. Then Evans Blue got on stage. HECKAHECKA YES! As Danielle would say. :P
Just like the last two times, they kicked ass. I love them live! And I love the one guitar player's avaitor goggles! SQUEE! They played (not in this order,  I'm too tired to remember that o.O): A Cross and a Girl Named Blessed, Cold (but I'm still here), Over, Possession, Dark that Follows, The Promise and the Threat, Quote, & The Tease. Sadly they didn't play Blackholes. Which sucked, since I love that song! OOOH! And also they sang Beg! And Ben Burley from Breaking Benjamin came out and started singing it with them. It FREAKING ROCKED!  They should so do a mix of that...you hear me you guys! MIX IT UP!
IT ROCKED! The set was great too! 
Squee!

And then the all time kick ass band--Breaking Benjamin! came on stage! WOOT!
And as always, for the last six times or so anyway :p, they kicked major assness!
Song list: Polyamorous, Home, Shallow Bay, So Cold, Simple Design, Sooner or Later, Away, Breakdown, The Diary of Jane, Breath (squee!), Dance with the Devil, Until the End, Topless, Had Enough; well okay, not all at once. They did their usual ""fake exit"" then came back and performed Blow Me Away, You, and Sugarcoat.

I got a hoodie! SQUEEEEE! I'm happy. It rocked. It was great---when the band first got on stage, Ben had a cigarette and a beer, and the guy behind me (as we all were cheering, duh) yelled. ""WOOO! Ben's gonna get lung cancer just like the rest of us! WOOOOO!"" That was pretty funny. We didnt get to yell to Ben that we love him this time---he told us he loved us first! SCORE!

YAY! So overall, the concert rocked! Duh. Why must it be over? COME BAAAAAACK! Ah well, until next time. I'll just burn out my cds :D

Now, onto the reason the rest of my day sucked so horribly.

A) I got up at six in the morning and went to school.

That's always a bad way to start the day, I don't care who you are.

B)Then, the weather sucked, so driving was....difficult. Cough. I'm 18 and I had to squint like an old person to see. STUPID SMOG! It was cold and wet and drizzley and and...

This leads me into my next part, that's why there's so many ands. I'm still irked. 

*deep breath* Goooose Fraaaaba.

Yeah. Okay. Well, traffic on I44 was backed up and I'm a very impatient person, so I wanted to find a back road. We stopped and got a map at a gas station and worked from there.  Well, the back road we took lead to a dead end...so I had to turn around. Not knowing where I was, I turned around the first place I saw, this gravelish looking road.

Oooooh no. It wasn't gravel. It was MUD. A shit puddle of mud. And I drive a sports car. I was stuck in the shit pile with no traction! We swerved for two hours, waiting for the towtruck to show up. What really pissed me off was guys with cables capable fo helping us just drove by laughing and shit. Only women asked us if we needed help. Except the two nice gentleman (an elderly dude and a UPS guy) tried to help us out. Naturally the towtruck showed up THEN. PFFT!

I was cold. I was wet. And I was covered in mud from trying to push my car out. Yeah. Need I mention it was like quicksand? I had to steam clean my car today to get all the muck out.
Then to make matters worse, the bank has my parents account screwed up, so the atm thingy wouldnt' except my dad's card. So with the 100 dollars I had, and 25 borrowed from Danielle, I paid the guy so we could go. GOD I was pissed.
I'd even been cussing up a storm in the car, about how the next time someone laughed at us,  was putting spikes on the road. Then when the next jackasses blew a tire, I was going to laugh hysterically ""Look who's stuck with us now, bitches!""
Plus the Highway Patrol officer was being an asshole. I had to call them to get help to get a towtruck (since I don't like, live in Saint Louis, hello). And he was all ""Are you on the road or not?""
Me: Technically, yes and no.
Him: You either are or you aren't.
Me: It is a road, just apparently not when it's rainy.
Him:...Yes or no?
Me: NO I'M STUCK IN MUD!

GOD DAMN! YOU LIVE HERE! YOU TELL ME!

Then, we finally get to the concert, with only 30 minutes to spare. I'd just gotten back into the heat of my car when I had to get back out and stand in the cold rainy weather AGAIN. Fabulous. I still have the big red X on my hand from the door people. Ick. It looks like blood. Kinda cool though. :p

Anywho, the concert rocked as stated above in that whole shindig. Then we're finally leaving, barely 1/2 a mile from the Pageant, when a truck pulls over into the front of my car, causing the tires to bump. Both vehicles pulled over (mine with many cussing passengers...okay, just two, but very loud cussing). Danielle surveyed damage for me since I couldn't get out of the car due to on coming cars. The people in the truck got out--oriental (I'm not racist, but come on). Then they started yelling at us in whatever language they were speaking. Saying it was our fault. They pulled into MY lane, without a FUCKING signal, WHATSOEVER! How the fuck is that MY FAULT!?
They left before we could call police. So we tailed them and Danielle wrote down the tags and shit for me. *glomps Danielle* In case I saw damage that was missed later.

Then I fell asleep (kinda) while driving home. I woke up and I was doing 95 miles per hour in a 70 mph zone. I passed a cop (luckily he was on the OTHER side of the highway}. Heh. We got home about 1.40am or so. I was fucking tired. Anywho, Danielle got to sleep pretty quick, I didn't though. I showered and had to tell my dad about the wreck. So I got about...three hours of sleep. Cos my dad had to be brilliant and wake me up at six since he made breakfast! *stabs him* The thought is nice, but not that early, and not when I'm that tired. 

God. That sucked so bad. 

Then I got more great news. Mic was nice enough to ask Evans Blue to sing happy birthday to me at the concert. Did they? No. And now he's reeeeeeeeeeally pissed. Fuming pissed. I fear he's going to wind up deleted off of myspace for cussing them out pissed. O.O *hugs Mic* The thought was sweet, sexy. 

Okay. I'm tired and missing NCIS (fuck!). So I'm going to go now. I'll add more later. Maybe. Possibly. 

O.O

How could I forget to mention the stripper at the concert? DAMN!

Anyway, during Buckcherry's sintilating performance of ""Crazy Bitch"", much of the crowd in front of me started to turn around. Being the curious person I am, I wanted to see what was going on. Katie was in the bathroom, so she didn't witness this.

A good majority of the UMB main stage is covered by a roof, with rafters on it. Some drunk guy had climbed one of the poles of the stage and was dancing in the rafters.

And then he began to strip. He was a good 80+ feet in the air, dancing barefoot on dinky rafters. Naturally security was called...and then the police. 

The band couldn't figure out why we weren't paying attention. We were too busy watching this guy grind and hump and strip along the rafters. He even danced his way back down and into the waiting police. 

As soon as he was arrested everyone cheered and applauded him.

The Jackass.

It was hilarous to watch though.

Everyone was waiting for him to fall. If he had, he would have died. He would have landed on a bunch of plastic seats, and possibly even otehr people. *rolls eyes*

Another reason they shouldn't sell booze at events like this. 

:D"

Wow. Yesterday was....holy fucking wow. GAH!
Minus my dad being with us. I shall leave him out though. Otherwise, bad comments will ensue.

Ahem.

FIRSTLY! 

Evans Blue: I LOVE THEM TO PIEEEEECES! I might have been the only person in my general section standing for them, but who fucking cares!?!?!
Between A Cross..,Cold, Beg, Over, The promise & the threat, The Tease, and Blackholes--I WAS TOO FREAKING STOKED TO CARE!!!
PLUS afterwards, I got my EB shirt signed by the band. Hoozah. They're awesome. Soooo nice too. Squee. Katie took pics of them for me. MUST GET THEM DEVELOPED!

Buckcherry
OMG. CRAZY BITCHNESS! They were def. rockin enough for me. Katie and I headbanged/danced the hell out of that song. Even if it went on for ten minutes. Heehee. 
Then the lead singer started making up very sexual lyrics and humping the microphone...that was...interesting.

Blue October
Katie claimed dibs on most of them. Oh well. 
They were great live. Better than I thought they'd be. Much actually. The lead singer started crying during Hate Me. Which I really could understand, since I'm sure the song is really a personal voicing...But yeah--they were awesome.

Hurt
Dude! The leadsinger was hot. It was the violin I think. Many he ripped that thing! It was amazing. Not to mention, I love the song ""Rapture"" so that was great to see performed. I'd love to see them again. It sucks that they didn't have any merch there this time. Ick. I WANTED A DAMN SHIRT! Eh, if I get desperate enough, I'll get one online.

Three Days Grace
ADAM IS MINE! I claimed dibs on him first. Though Katie and I decided to share him. RAWR! After seeing him live, I def see why he's on the Yummyfactor list. RAWR ADAM RAWR! *jumps him*
Yeah, they played: Animal I have become, home, riot, I hate everything..., Just like you, Home, Pain, and I think that's it.  They might have played something else, I just don't remember. I'm too wired to remember much. But they were FUCKING AMAZING! I want to see them again. COME BACK TDG!! WOOT! I got a shirt :D

Breaking Benjamin
HOLY CHEESE I LOVE THEM! *glomp* No really. They kick ass live EVERY time I see them. And that's been...what? Five or six times? Yeah. This time they sang: Polyamorous, Natural Life, Shallow Bay,  Home (my fav live), Blow me away, So cold, Simple design, Sooner or later, away, breakdown, Diar of Jane, & Breath. THEY DIDNT SING RAIN! WTF?! You have to sing rain! Accoustic! COME BACK HERE DAMN YOU! 

Yeah. But still. It was fucking brilliant. After the third song, Katie and I yelled ""We love you!"". Ben laughed and said, ""Aww, I love you too!""

YAY! GO US! I took some pics of them on stage, and once while in the Pointfest booth. I was going to get them to sign some of my merch, but the line for them was five miles long...2 1/2 hours before they were to sign stuff. Yeah. Ebay is my friend :p

I'm pretty sure I'll love the new cd--which comes out in TWO DAYS! SQUEEE! Can't wait. *bounce* I'm ready to see them again, even though I don't have a voice at the moment. I screamed it all away. Teehee. 

Staind
MUDSHOVEL! WOOT! I like some of the other staind songs, but that's my fav. It's my angry song. SCORE! I love the feel of the bass when they play. It makes me all tingly. I love it. Thornley's was the best bass so far, but they come close. As last time, they were sweet live. The graphics were great too! YAY!

I drove up and home so we didn't get lost or anything. And I made good time! Even if we didn't get back until 3. Damn Steak N Shake. I CURSE YOU! We ate at Steak N Shake by the Mills...we didn't get our drinks for an hour, and the found out the orders hadn't even been started...so we left.

And went to a S&S in Eureka (twas the only place open---yergh). We got our food quickly--especially since we already knew what we wanted. 

Over all, I got five shirts: Two BB, One EB, one TDG, and a Staind shirt. YAY! They didn't have any BB necklaces this time, which sucked since I wanted another one (just in case). Mer. 

Ah well. I had a great time, over all. We sat by some guys that rocked hard with us, esp during BB. :D That's always a plus. 

Well, I'm tired of typing so I'll shut up now. 

For a while anyway.

XO

Bring on more Pointfest!!"

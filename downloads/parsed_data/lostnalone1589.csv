"event","PEKIN - A 17-year-old Pekin High School Senior died after collapsing in a school hallway Wednesday morning. Hanna Holder was pronounced dead in the Pekin Hospital Emergency Room around 7:30 a.m.
An autopsy will be conducted tomorrow; no foul play is suspected, Tazewell County Coroner Dennis Conover said.

This is the sixth death of a Pekin High School student thus far this school year. Five others died in car accidents in September and October.

""I don't know of anybody in any school who's grieved as much in a school year as we have at Pekin High,"" Superintendent Paula Davis said."

"event","I'm really confused
I don't know where to turn
I've lost my way
I've lost the point of living
And i can't find it
Its been gone for awhile
But i don't know exactly when i lost it
was it when i left you
or when i knew we were through
or was it when i was being used
i'm not for sure when it all began
but i know its causing me pain
and i can't hide it anymore
you can only hide it for so long
and its gotten to the point where it needs to come out
but i don't know how to tell you
so that u will understand
but i don't think u ever will
because you don't care anymore
its done, we're done and thats all u see
and thats fine but i'm still lost
i don't know what to do
i try to forget but it all comes back
then i embrace the thought and i cry 
cryin makes it worse then in a few days i'm over it
then something else makes me think of u
and i'm confused one minute i'm sad cuz its over
and then next i'm mad cuz i wasted my time on something not meant to be
knowing it wouldn't work out but did it anyway
and its my fault i feel this way but i don't know how to get rid of this
but its not just you who is causing confusion
there is one more
i think he confuses me the most
one minute he cares and then next he don't
hes not very open with his feelings so i don't know what to do
and this makes it hard to get close to you
i wanna get close and make things work 
but theres the fear of gettin hurt
and i don't wanna go thru that again
hurt lasts a LONG time and it will always dwell inside
never to leave ur thoughts, just there to eat you away
2 years and i'm still feelin it and i don't wanna add to that
i want to be with u but i don't want the hurt that i know will come
i'm hurting being alone and i will hurt being with you
i don't know what to do and i never will this will always be the case
can't change it"

"event","Well...i'm here yet again to complain about guys, seems that all i ever do but yet for some reason i want a bf. Makes no sense to me; just nice having someone around that loves you and wants to be with you i guess, but then again they are ALL pervs and liars *sigh* i just wanna forget the whole having a bf thing but it seems that in life now its a must, everyones gotta be dating someone to matter, idk.

Now the guys on the net OMG they driver me nuts...you talk to them they seem sweet u start to like them then they get all wierd on you and i know its over the net but you can get attacthed to a point and when they go all asshole on you kinda breaks ur heart a lil more if you liked them. And then that bullshit they throw at ya ""i love you"" you don't know me so how the fuck can u love me?!?!? Just shows guys can be assholes no matter the circumstances. I'm gonna regret sayin because i'm playing stupid yet again but i've been talkin to this guy Justin for a couple years now i think, we use to fight 24/7 but its gettin better. WE just started talkin again like a week ago and i tried soo hard to push him away cuz i don't wanna get caught up in this again and get hurt i can't help it hes nice and seems sincere and if hes not he plays a good game, but he lives in texas so i don't know if it will work out. We talk about meetin up and stuff in a couple years but who knows what will happen in a couple years. I don't think a non-virgin could go that long without sex but who knows maybe he is sincere and if he is thats great and i can be happy again. But its just hard trustin guys anymore with what i've been thro with the past guys and over the net its even harder cuz u don't really know if they are who they say they are. For the most part i trust him and believe that he cares about me cuz no one fights that much and still talks afterwards if they don't care about each other idk I shall find out!"

"event","i talked to eddie last night... that was interesting! I've known this kid for maybe 3 weeks or so like talkin to him and stuff well he stood me up and now 2 weeks later hes talkin to me again. Well tonight he texted me and asked me since we have seen each other and know eachother can i ask some personal questsions so i was like sure cuz ya get it all the time in the chatrooms so it didn't bother me but he asked me what all i've done with a guy and all that good stuff then it came down to him tellin me he wanted to be more than friends. So me being the teasin i am asked him what me meant by that and he said 'he wanted to show me the good things in life' that is the best line i've heard heard and so i was like what do u have in mind and he said...*my hands on ur body and me kissing u in good spots... good stuff of course* and let me tell you that sounds very very very tempting and if it wasn't him i might go for it. But you don't NOT stand a girl up and then ask for sex 2 weeks later doesn't work. so yea yet another guy proving that men are indeed assholes!"

"event","I had sooo much fun tonight. Kyle called me at like 3:30 and picked me up and we went to the vet and walmart and back to his house. I haven't been to his house in FOREVER and it was really weird but we played cards and he tried to teach me how to play poker and then we played chess which the 2 games lasted like 2 minutes and i lost. Then we came back to my house to tell my dad where i was going and then met Jessica B. and ate dinner and then went to get her bf and her bro's g/f and went to a movie. IT was soo freakin scary and i jumped like every 10 minutes and kyle just laughed at me. But anywho it was a lot of fun and we will prolly never hang out again but it was awesome."

"event","True Love is when you shed a tear and still want him. Its when he ignores you and you still love him. Its when he loves another girl but you still smile and say I'm happy for you when all you reall do it cry.

That i believe is true love and thats exactly how i feel with/about ryan. I want to be with him even knowing that could get hurt or that he might use me but i would still give anything to be with him again.

I hate school not because of my classes or homework or anything its bcuz always see people with their bf or gf kissing and holdin hands and huggin and i just think back when me and ryan did that and i was so happy. I never knew that one person could make me so happy."

lets you blend. People love the stability you have<br>because as others may come
and go, you will always be there and you may always<br>be the same. You like simple
things and that's what people like about you. You<br>most likely enjoy things most
consider normal, like movies, shopping, that sort<br>of thing and are very friendly
and probably have many friends. You are sweet and<br>kind and that shows on you,
but you're also strong and not very naive. You're a<br>rather well-rounded
individual. Even though some people pass you off as<br>just another girl, shrug it
off because they don't know what they're<br>missing.</p>

Cracked my head open nothing too bad. But brittany came over and everytime she comes over or i hang out with her she makes some remark about Ryan i thinks its just to piss me off but lately i think she is rubbin in the fact that she is hangin out with Travis again. She called Travis today and i had this weird feeling rush through me knowing that she was calling his house and that Ryan could have picked up the phone and knowing i couldn't talk to him, i wanted to cry. honestly i don't think any one knows what i am going through; no big deal to most; but this is my life and it matters to me, its my happiness/unhappiness. I just want one last chance  everything would be soo different. *sigh* i don't know what to do but i know what i am not gonna do and thats give up.
I came home today after babysittin and got on the net and had like 2 people adding me to their buddy list and i didn't know one of the sn's so i denied it and they popped up and said heys its ryan and i think my heart stopped and i just staired at the screen and hoped he was him....but it wasn't."

And thinkin about him treating her the way he did me is killing me. I can just see him holdin her hand and tellin her he loves her and it hurts and i don't think i can take it. Knowing i let the best part of my life go pains me and i can't do shit about it. And on top of that i've got 2 friends that want to die. i talked to one of them (erik) last night til like 12 tryin to make him feel better and today when he finds out about all this what do i get ""thats stupid"" nice to know my own friend doesn't care. Gotta love that.

~Thanks alot Erik~    ~Goodbye Ryan I love you but you've moved on i hope she treats you well and i hope you guys are happy together I will always love you more than anyone can~

It just makes the fact that me and him arn't together even worse, like re-opening a wound. Oh well I guess it nice to dream that me and him are together and have like a split second of happiness every so often.

"event","Last night i finally got to go hang out with a guy, it was fun. Me and brit drove around with zach for like 4 hours it was fun. I got everyone yellin at me cuz they don't want me to be friends with him and they think just cuz i am hanging out with him that i wanna date him. But he is a bad bf and he pretty much proved that last night with the conversations but oh well. 

Oh wonderful news i am gonna have about 2 people hating me tonight and maybe even more tomorrow. Drugs are bad and i'm like the only one that knows it."

"event","I don't know what to do: I want to tell Ryan EVERYTHING that i miss him and regret everything i did and would do anything for another chance or should i just try to get the friendship and trust back and hope that we get back together. I want him to know how i feel but i don't wanna loose him but then again i don't wanna get my hopes up by being friends with him and then have them smashed. If i tell him then everything is out and it will be either good or bad but if i rush him then what might have been a yes could be a no, I don't wanna mess this up anymore than what it is i want to fix it. I want to be in his arms stairing into his beautiful green eyes; thats the only thing in the world i want. He is the one i know it  i don't know how i know it but something is just tellin me not to give up.

*Ryan i will ALWAYS love you and nothing will ever change that*"

You people don't know what happened between us therefor you know nothing so stop with the advice. And that crap that i'm too young to be in love with someone.. i would like to know what you call it when you wanna be with someone 24/7, and your sad when they are sad, and all that good stuff  anywho.... dena leave me alone"

We got to the park and i sat on the bench that me and him sat on with brittany and travis and its like everything came back to me. I remembered that we were all throwing nuts at each other and then we went back to brittanys house and hung out there, it was fun. I miss him a lot i feel like part of me is missing and i just feel lost with out him. And i have noticed that i get really really jealous with lena and ricky cuz she is happy and has someone who cares about her and i don't."

Brit picked me up and told me that the other dude didn't want to come, so i was by myself and gonna see a scary movie. We got to the movie place and me and brit were talkin about who to ask and i said something about Zach. So she called him and we went and picked him up and i paid for him and so on. About half way through the movie i was gettin scared and so Zach put his arm around me and was hold my hand and told me not to break his fingers lol. But yea anyway movie got over with and we walked out to the car and brit took me home and zach gave me a hug b4 i got outta the car. He is such a nice guy but i will never date him again unless he stops cheatin on his gfs."

"event","I stayed the night at Raeann's house last night; Loads of fun. Stayed up til like 5 and had to get up at 1 and haven't gotten the chance to sleep yet. So i'm tired and really really crabby. And when i'm tired i tend to get really emotional which is why i've been crying. I miss him so bad and no one understands what i'm going through. Everyone says to get over him, its not ez it wasn't ez the first time it won't be any ezier this time. In fact its gonna be worse cuz he changed a lot and a lot more happened. I've been reading his e-mails and looking at his pictures and thinkin about everything and i am stupid for listenin to people. Cuz the people that told me to break up with him pretty much stopped talking to me so THANKS A LOT ASSHOLES! I've honested screwed my life up. He was the one and i know it and i will never get another chance all bcuz i listened to my ""friends"". I would rather just live without friends if this is what they are gonna do. I just wanna go back and redo everything cuz i know me and him would still be together and happy and still in love. Ryan i'm so sorry and i wish u know how i really felt and i would never let this happen again. Ur the one i wanna be with and i will wait cuz ur worth it."

Its very depressing, i miss him a lot and he doesn't even know nor care. I always find stuff that reminds me of him cuz i really loved him. But i had my 2nd chance and i messed it up so i need to get over it not as easier as it sounds.  I love you Ryan and I miss you so much!"

Its nice to know that people think ur pretty but its all the questions that come after it. I was talking to some guy and he seemed really nie and all that other stuff but then he was like ""can i ask u a personally question"" and i was like can i guess what it is and i said ""its it  are u a virgin""  I WAS RIGHT!!!  It always happens. Guys are sooooooo predictable. I just wanna go in a chat and find a decent guy to talk to not to date, or cyber or any of that crap. GGGRRRRRR  GUYS SUCK!!!!!!!"

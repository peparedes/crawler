[Under a cut cause it's pretty legnthy]

<lj-cut>

""A Pair of Deviant Bookends"" by Johnny Depp

""Buy the ticket, take the ride."" These are the words that echo in my skull. The words that our Good Doctor lived by and, by God, died by. He dictated, created, commanded, demanded, manipulated, manhandled and snatched life up by the short hairs and only relinquished his powerful grasp when he was ready. There's the rub. When he was ready. That is what we are left with. We are here, without him. But in no way are we left with nothing, far from it. We have his words, his books, his insights, his humor and his truth. For those of us lucky enough to have been close to him, which often meant rather lengthy and dangerous occasions that would invariably lead to uncontrollable fits of laughter, we have the memory of his Cheshire grin leading us wherever he felt we needed to go. Which, by the way, was always the right direction, however insane it may have seemed. Yes, the doctor always knew best. I have, seared onto my brain, the millions of hideous little adventures that I was blessed enough to have lived through with him, and frankly, in certain instances, blessed to have lived through. He was/is a brother, a friend, a hero, a father, a son, a teacher, a partner in crime. Our crime: fun. Always fun.

In December 1995 I was vacationing in Aspen, Colorado...The f--king town is just lousy with ""beautiful people."" My first instinct was to stay inside and drink grog, or as the twinkling jet set refers to them, ""hot toddies."" My time in Aspen was spent as far from the madding crowd as humanly possible until, in spite of my self-induced seclusion, I ran into Alan Finkelstein. Alan, being no stranger to fun, sprang the news on me that Dr. Hunter S. Thompson lived nearby, and would I like to meet him that night at Woody Creek Tavern?

A few of us wandered out into the snow and waited for lightning to strike. Somewhere around 11 PM, an unusually loud noise stole my attention and then demanded the room's attention - a hush on one side, fearful murmurings on the other, were replaced by mounting screams, as what appeared to be an electric saber swung wildly near the entrance of the bar. A deep, raspy voice was hollering for people to get out of his way, threatening to shock the living s--t out of any swine who lingered in his path.

Tall and lanky, wearing a woolen Native American looking knit hat that trailed down past his shoulders, the ubiquitous aviators tight to the face attached to that smile - a massive hand shot toward me. I placed my hand in his firm hold and gave back what I got. The beginning, I knew, of a long and deep-rooted friendship.

He plopped himself into a chair, laid his armaments on the table - a giant cattle prod and a hefty Taser gun. We had a few rounds, talked about this and that and connected on more than a few levels, not the least being the discovery that we both hailed from the same dark and bloody ground, the great state of Kentucky. That fact alone sent Hunter into eloquent tirades ranging from Southern chivalry to hillbilly moonshine-running to our fellow Kentuckian Cassius Clay. Within no time, the group was invited back to Owl Farm. Hunter's fortified compound just up the road from the tavern. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Hunter's assistant, Deborah Fuller, who would later become known as the Vitamin Queen, because of her painstaking and meticulous nursing of Hunter - and myself when I moved into the house. Her daily delivery of B's, C's, D's, and E's and general TLC kept us as healthy and alive as was within reason, bless her.

Hunter and I hunkered down in the kitchen, better known as the ""command center,"" babbling ourselves silly, when I paid him a compliment concerning a smart-looking nickel-plated shotgun hanging up on a rack. Before I knew what was what, I found my hands wrapped around a rather large propane tank, and he was meticulously instructing me to duct-tape a fist-size box to the side of it. While in the process of this bizarre ritual, I inquired as to the box's contents. ""Oh, yeah...that??? Uh...nitroglycerin."" Panicked, I instantly and deftly heaved the cigarette I was smoking into the kitchen sink and continued the job.

At roughly 2:00 AM, we strolled out to Hunter's back yard. My larger-than-large propane bomb sat approximately fifteen yards dead ahead. The Good Doctor was off to my right coaching and coaxing, giddy with anticipation. Shotgun firmly in hand, I pumped a shell into the chamber and leveled the beast at our preposterously explosive target. Pitch-black night, a thousand million stars in the sky, dead calm, the neighbors safely tucked in for a pleasant nighty-night and then, BLAMMO! A direct hit and the target exploded into an eighty-foot fireball. ""Good shooting, man!"" Hunter feverishly screamed. ""That was one h-ll of a shot...Hot dam-! Yes!""

Sometime later, I was working in New York City. One morning at about 5:30 AM, slugging it out with a treadmill on a radical incline, huffing, puffing, sweat roping off me, training like a bas--rd for the film ""Donnie Brasco."" The phone rang. Hmmm. Odd time for someone to be calling, I thought. ""Hello?"" ""Johnny....Hunter. What's wrong with you, you sound sick!"" Good God, there was no way in h-ll that I could've explained a treadmill to him at this time, far too mortifying. I jumped into the conversation: ""Nothing, no...just getting ready to go to work. How are you?"" ""Fine, fine---listen, if they were going to do a film of the Vegas book...would you be interested? Would you want to play me?"" I was stunned. I hopped off that dastardly whore of a treadmill and tried to gather myself. ""Well...what about it? Are you in?"" Of course I was. Who wouldn't have been? I was beyond interested. We spoke a bit more about it, the hows, the whos, the whens, the whys, etc. It was then that I learned that there really weren't any - no script, no director, no production at all. It simply didn't exist. Not yet, anyway. He'd inquired for his own edification. He did that sort of thing a lot. Hunter was always way ahead of the curve - even in what appeared to be absolute chaos, he was all too aware of exactly where the chips would fall.

After a gathering in New York to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" or as he called it, ""the Vegas book,"" a handful of us ended up at Hunter's hotel suite for several nightcaps. I took advantage of the opportunity and cornered the Good Doctor to say that if I was to do the film, I would first need his blessing - if he was comfortable giving it - and that if I did even a remotely decent job playing him, there was a dam- good chance he might well hate me for the rest of his life. Bang. Those black eyes shot into mine, twinkling like stars. I remember the smile on his face like it was yesterday. Cheshire. ""Well, what the f--k ... buy the ticket, take the ride, eh?... And let's hope for the best, hee, hee...for your sake.""

The ""Vegas film"" finally got set up, and the time had come for some serious soul-stealing. I flew into Aspen and was greeted at the airport by Hunter in his '71 Chevy convertible, a.k.a. the Red Shark. I was sporting a woolen toque on my head, having already done the initial razoring to my skull. Hunter was leery to see what I was hiding under my cap. ""Oh, Jesus...Let's see it,"" he reluctantly said. I whipped the f--ker off and felt the wind on my bald pate. ""Holy Christ! You look terrible...F--k man...put that hat back on, it's making me sick!""

We serpentined our way through the mountains and arrived at Owl Farm, where I was swiftly invited to put my things in the basement. Hunter and Deborah had, very kindly, set up a room for me and gave me access to pile after pile of manuscripts, work notes, trinkets, bars of soap from Vegas and other holy relics. I lived in that basement for much longer than was planned and grew to be kind of comfortable with the brown recluse spiders I shared the room with.

One night I was sitting on my bed having a smoke and going through some of Hunter's notes from the Vegas days and brilliant scenes that, for some reason, were edited out of the book. I placed my cigarette in the ashtray that was sitting on the nightstand. For some reason, I began to examine the nightstand, a barrel of sorts...wooden slats, steel bands, the whole bit. As I scrutinized it a bit more, a wave of fear hit me, the likes of which I'd never experienced. My nightstand was a keg of gunpowder. Sprinting up the stairs as fast as a cheetah, I located Hunter sitting at command central. ""Hunter...you've gotta come with me...I need to know if...come on, come downstairs!"" He looked confused but humored me and walked down to my room. ""What's gotten into you, Colonel? Is it those filthy little brown recluses again?"" ""No. It's that thing!"" I pointed to the offending object and begged him to tell me if it was actually full and active. A look of recognition came across his face. ""Oh, God, that's where it is! I've always wondered what happened to it.""

""YIKES! Is it full?"" I was flipping.

""F--k, yes, it's full! Holy sh-t, that go--amn thing could've blown us all off the map, especially with you smoking near it! Ye gods, man. What's wrong with you?"" He giggled for weeks, even years about that. So did I. I'm still giggling.

For days and nights on end, we would sit in that command center, and talk about anything and everything from politics to weapons, our home state, lipstick, music, Hitler's paintings, literature, sports. Always sports. We were talking one night about which ones he preferred and didn't. We were watching plenty of basketball and loads of football, so I asked him if he was ever a baseball fan, to which he replied flatly, ""No. Baseball is like watching a bunch of angry Jews arguing on the porch."" Once, a year later, we'd made a bet on the World Cup soccer tournament, France vs. Brazil. He was positive that Brazil was going to cream France. I took that bet, one thousand dollars. We teased and prodded each other for weeks leading up to the match. The outcome bent in my favor; he promptly wrote me a check and sent it with this letter:

""Well, Colonel, I told you the f--king game was fixed. I just didn't think those prissy quadroon boys would go totally into the tank. They acted like stupid animals. They sh-t all over themselves and disgraced a whole nation of gutless whores in the eyes of the world. And it taught me another good lesson in WHY amateurs shouldn't f--k around with gambling on games they know nothing about. Anyway, here's a check for $1,000. Thank you very much for yr. business. I'll be back, Okay. Doc""

His generousity was astounding. Never once did he try to wriggle away from my never-ending barrage of questions. He was always exceptionally patient and very giving. He was totally open regarding the details of his exploits and personal experiences, even the more intimate particulars of his past. The more time together, the more intense the bond. The connection was profound and becoming more so.

I used to tease him that we were becoming a perversely twisted version of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, which really made him uncomfortable. I had, by this point, purloined an impressive amount of his clothing from the Vegas period and adopted the same mode of dress: the aviator shades, a bush hat, short pants, athletic socks, Converse sneakers, cigarette holder clenched tightly between the teeth. We'd saunter out of the house to take a drive in the car like freakish twins.

So, for good or ill, there we were, a pair of deviant bookends on the prowl.

Truly, the man should be sainted for putting up with my continual scratching away at the layers of his life. He stuck it out like a champion and couldn't have been a better friend.

When the film was done, a fresh print was put on a fast horse to Aspen for Hunter's consumption. This was it, the moment of truth. I feared that our friendship would come crumbling down as a result of my interpretation of him and his work. I pulled up my bootstraps and made the call, more than half expecting him to either not pick up or chew me out in a hideous finale that would've crushed me. ""Well, Doctor...do you hate me?"" His diagnosis was calm and dazzling. ""No, no...Colonel, I feel good. Watching the film was like an eerie trumpet call over a lost battlefield."" My elation at not letting him down shot skyward.

There are endless other moments and experiences that I was fortunate enough to have gone through with Hunter, far too many to write about at this time. I cherish the seconds and milliseconds I shared with him. I was well aware that it was all going to happen only once in a lifetime. These were fantastic experiences. Some of the best moments of my life were happening to me and, luckily, I knew it.</lj-cut>

I hope everyone found it just as beautiful as I do.

Much Love,
Lily"

We made it a tribute night to classics (Home Alone, Page Master, Freddy Kruger, so on) Kieran Culkin movies (Kudos to his new play he's in!) And some Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt movies. Did me some good. Me and Mom's boyfriend also bonded some as I drove (to get used to my new stickshift) and it was pretty cool. Surprisingly. Only person I'm really about to kill is my Mom. I swear she has to ruin everything. But I won't go onto the shit in my life, just focus on the good. 

I'll be busy still doing this move shite. lol. I never realize how agonizin' it is to move, but all well, it has to be done. Almost done really, just gotta move all the stuff from this place to Hal's place. Oh yeah, and I made an icon of myself! LoL. It's a kinda old picture about a year old, and I look like a geek, but still, made it anyways.

I think that's about it. Really I just wanted to update to use another mood icon. lol. Much Love everyeone.

<P>Not all my thoughts reach my lips.</P>
<P>I write about passion</P>
<P>I write about confessions</P>
<P>Atmitting them in all sorts of fashions</P>
<P>And yet I make so many digressions</P>
<P>Lines I don't read</P>
<P>Words I can't say</P>
<P>All my wants, all my needs</P>
<P>I just push them asides for another day.</P>
<P>To make love, to be loved, to tell you how I feel.</P>
<P>To be scared, to feel whole to show you this is real.</P>
<P>Try and give you what I once had,</P>
<P>Try and believe it isn't so bad,</P>
<P>Give you my last innocense,</P>
<P>To me, most intense,</P>
<P>Hardest thing I could ever give</P>
<P>The part of me that only lives</P>
<P>To give you my trust, my heart, my bleeding soul</P>
<P>to give you mwhat I'm afraid to say,&nbsp;the things that&nbsp;makes me whole.</P>
<P>I give you my fears, I give you my tears</P>
<P>I give you blushes, I give you all those suches</P>
<P>My stutters, my screams</P>
<P>All of my in betweens</P>
<P>The moments when I'm dead</P>
<P>Or most alive making love in my bed</P>
<P>The words I can't say</P>
<P>I send them all your way</P>
<P>They're all I have left to show</P>
<P>It's so hard to let them go</P>
<P>But I love you more than any in so long</P>
<P>Even when you make me weak, you make me strong,</P>
<P>I look into your eyes and I foreget my days</P>
<P>I feel your touch and I believe I'm okay</P>
<P>Your moan makes me weak</P>
<P>Your laughter makes me squeek</P>
<P>How could I ever not want to make you mine</P>
<P>But as i do promise I wait a year's time.</P>
<P>So now you know I'm in love in my own way</P>
<P>With all the things I cannot say</P>
<P>Te amor con cada dia</P>
<P>Permita que las cosas ellos pueden</lj-cut></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>more laters mom is kicking me off, so did that all in a rush and i will fix it all laters!</P>

"event","<P>Long Over Due Update!</P>
<P>Many things have happened lately, so I haven't been able to update. Let me get them out the way and then We'll get into the lovely pictures I wish to post today.</P>
<P>The events that have happened in less than a month:</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""The Drama""></P>
<P><ul>
<li>I've been laid off. (My work closes down on the 5th and I haven't gotten to work in two weeks now....le sigh)</li>
<P>
<li>My Mom's boyfriend's daughter just recently went into the hospital and found out she has a broken toe and blood from the ears from a very bad infection.</li></P>
<P>
<li>I still have no car, so I can't get another job. Which also goes into By Febuary I'm moving. Not too far but far enough to drive me crazy w/o a car. It's away from town and away from my only great friend. And there is no phone lines activated at his house so I have no Idea when I'd be able to get online either.</li></P>
<P>
<li>My (ex????)boyfriend came to visit for X-mas, told me he still is mad for me, he was my first love, known him three years now, and he decided to just leave, w/o a goodbye.</li></P>
<P>
And</P>
<P>
<li>I have to push back College cause of all the drama, yet again, for the third time. (I've just given up on my mind I swear, it doesn't know how to operate anymore)</li></P>
</ul></lj-cut>
<P>Yeh don't really have to read all that, It was just me putting all in perspective of the shit going on. Now I just got to figure out which phone calls to make first to get life back on track. Now this part is the part you may wish to click into. Or at least I hope you enjoy it as much as me. <IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/tongue.gif""></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""My New Beauties in my Life""> </P>
<P>First Icons:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/lesigh2.png"">&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/silence.png""></P>
<P>Then Diego Pictures that I really really like. (It was hard to just post two) They come from <A href=""http://www.isifa.com"">ISIFA</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/brasil3.jpg"">&nbsp;</P>
<P>(ooo, That one is From Diego-Luna.net I""M SORRY I forgot I got it there.)</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/dios_011.jpg""></P>
<P>Beautiful......... *le sighs*</P>
<P>And now Gael pictures. (Again very very hard to pick just two)</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/is_10582321.jpg""></P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/is_10410568.jpg""></P>
<P>I love him with a hair cut, and smiling. Well, I love him period, but yeah, Those are amoung my favorites. *le sighs more* I just saw&nbsp;El Crimen del Padre Amaro! Wow. Made me soooo sad, but that was a beautifully done movie. I can't wait to see La Mala Educacion!!! I wish I could see Amores Perro or Dot the I, but they aren't out over here. (To buy or rent I mean, and in town lmao) ""I'm With Lucy"" is at my Blockbuster, but It was out when I went there. So I'm hoping next time I have money (Cause I'm beyond broke) I can go see it.</lj-cut><BR><BR>so, ANYWAYS, lol. Trying to keep my head up and getting distracted by such cuties. hehehe. I hope all had a great New Year, and Great Christmas. Much love to you all!</P>

"event","<P>So I've had Gael on me mind now for some time...... Slowly I am turning, I'm telling you. I fell in love with the simpliest things. His Smile, his eyes, his blinks......*nods* His blinks. Check this out:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/blinkies.gif"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/blinkiesideways.gif"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh, and....<lj-cut text=""Le Cough""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;<IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/omegawd.gif""></P>
<P>Ok, so tech. This isn't a blink but its still a ""WTF"" face. Was going to do one more of him looking shy but I *had* To resist. Ooo, and thinking about resisting, how I could resist this....</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/motorcyclediaries03.jpg""></P>
<P>Answer me this ONE question.....What color are his eyes there? If anyone says a shade-ish of blue, or anywhere close to blue I swear I will just kiss them hard and die happy. </P>
<P>Oh yeah, I also made this <IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/focus.png"">&nbsp;icon for a Gael/Diego Icon place contest, but dunno how anyone feels about it.</P>
<P>Last but not least:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/motorcyclediaries01.jpg""></P>
<P>I have a weak spot for that little raft. And well, him ""Mambo Tago""ing. That was no doubt the cutest thing I've seen in some while. *le sighs and updates* (Noticed I forgot totally about my life in this update??? lmao)</P>"

"event","<P>Wow. I forget this thing easily lately. I've been busy with personal life since Christmas, I guess. My ex came into town for a bit but sorddda been avoiding him. Saw Motorcycle Diaries and wow. Wow. Amazin' movie when I could actually focus on it. I mean, can a girl really focus with Gael in just a muscle shirt???? *coughs innocently* ;D! Usually I have pictures, but tonight Just three icons, another icon I made for the beautiful lady who tells me wonderful stories, and a picture of Diego from <A href=""http://www.diego-luna.net"">Diego-Luna</A>. </P>
<P>Seems my mind is slowly but surely becomin' more and more on these two men. Very interestin' indeed. I still think of me other men as well, no worries. Jared, Colin, Orlando Bloom, Ewan Mc...all still in my mind. But hmm, Can't help but to enjoy Gael and Diego while it lasts. I could ramble on and on but instead I wish to see what you think of the icons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""My Heaven and his Angel""> </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/inlove.png""></P>
<P>First one I did, so it was kindddda out there. LOL</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/dreams.png""></P>
<P>Second one I did, and it got better.....</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/needtocrush.png""></P>
<P>Third one I did with Lyrics and combined the Red and blue. ;D</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/sgo.png""></P>
<P>Now this one is for <lj user=""sweetgael"" /> and I hope she likes it. I saw the picture and automatically thought of her!</P>
<P>And last, but not least, just cause I like it so much.</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/PDVD_021.jpg""></P>
<P>Something about men in Muscle shirts.......... *le cough*</P>
<P>Edit:</P>
<P>I have a picture of Diego with Glasses and I always think, ""I know I saw Gael in simular glasses.........."" I've only been successful in finding one picture of this, but here's the Diego picture:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/nicotina004.jpg"">&nbsp;</P>
<P>((((Disclaimer on the Picture!!))) Anyone seen Gael in his???? I know I saw one of him smiling with his glasses on once, but of course since I'm looking for it, it's no where to be found.</lj-cut></P>
<P>And I think that may be it tonight. Working on some photos, so maybe I'll come back later and edit, but currently I hope you like what you see.</P>

"event","<P>Ok, I promised a proper Update so I can't lie huh? Not much to say about myself. I'm sick and relieved though. I thought I had to work at 11, but when I woke up late (again the sickness) I called in and realized I don't work until tonight. So at least I'm not in trouble. My job is closing down though In January so I have to start looking for another job. The one I had in mind I probably won't be able to do until summer, and I can't just sit around for 5 months with no job. </P>
<P>Suppose to sign up for College by Jan. 5th so I'm crunching to get a car. I can't believe I *still* don't have one. Jaysus. Luck is just not on my side currently. I will probably end up having to wait until my other friend starts going to College next fall. Then at least I'll have a friend huh? -lol-</P>
<P>Ok, no more bla bla only cause I hate talking about myself really. (Then why the journal??? Simple cause I get to post pictures of people that are just so hot. LOL) So without further delay:</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Why I can never think straight""> </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/tma326.jpg""></P>

<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/jaredleto.jpg""></P>
<P>Something I""m actually proud of! I made that for a Jared page for a friend. It's pretty spiffie on a black backround. (To me anyways)</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/foto_01.jpg""></P>
<P>I never realized how short he was, but Wow, I saw this and Kept thinking ""awwwwwwwwww!""</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/DIEGO_LUNA_img001.jpg""></P>
<P>So I see this picture alot from my friend who is slowly becoming in love with Gael, but I ment to post it as for Diego...so lets see if we can find Diego alone, without Gael........</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/dvojka.gif""></P>
<P>Hmm, Nope, still with Gael...</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/YtuMamaTambien.jpg""></P>
<P>Funny, but nopes, still not alone!</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/wmu7c.bmp""></P>
<P>They are so cute together huh? Even in B'n'W, ...I mean...</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/13219_2.jpg""></P>
<P>Wow, so it is possible for him to be without Gael!!! -LOL-</P>
<P>Hmm, are there any other cuties.....</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v160/billiaminic/Misc/ColinCal3.jpg""></P>
<P>Just because I love that picture. I had one of him and Jared all happily looking at one another but I don't feel like uploading it at the moment. -lol- Hmm, I think that's all for today!</lj-cut></P>
<P>So yeah, I hope you enjoyed all of that, as I do, and I wonder what I'll be updating with next?</P>

Billy Boyd has been kinda out of sight lately. (Which is very sad to
those like myself who wish to see more of him!) BUT there is hope. He
is a voice in the new movie comming of (Sequel to Chucky as you all
know) <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Seed of Chucky</span>.
(picture below) Also I heard wind that Billy may be in a movie that is
actually made by (or is directed by, I'm not quite sure which) By Ewan
McGregor's mother, Carol.<br>

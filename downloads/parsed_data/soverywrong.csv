My journal is now friends only, my old posts are still available because I'm too damn lazy to go through an individually modify each one.  Perhaps I'll find the Python scripts I wrote for backup and recovery purposes and modify those to change them, but until then they're old anyway and I'm not really worried about it.  If you'd like to be added to my friends list, drop a comment in here and a team of rabid hamsters will run across my keyboard, if a hash of the characters displayed return a value greater than 3,210 then you can be my friend.  If you fall short of the magic number, you will be mauled by bears.

Thanks,
The Management

<strong>Update: Heh, this wasn't very useful since I only allowed friends to post comments.  Now all registered users can post comments.</strong>"

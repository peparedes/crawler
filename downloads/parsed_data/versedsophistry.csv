"event","Me oh my do I have an update this time.  I've finished not one, but two short stories, both the rave story and Elaine's.  If you're interested in reading (and especially critiquing!) either, feel free to drop me an e-mail, and I'll send it right off.

I like the way the rave story progresses, though out of the three responses I've been given, one was negative, one was positive, and one was utterly neutral.  I submitted it to <a href=""http://www.critters.org"">Critters</a>, so I'll wait to see what they say before I do anything drastic to it.

<lj-cut text=""Rave story synopsis""><b>Synopsis of Ecstatic Pulse</b>

Mark tries an experimental combination of psychotropic drugs at a rave.  Intending to use his altered awareness to try and focus the unfettered energy in the dancing kids, he hopes to come out of the experience empowered with the ability to accomplish feats unheard of.  Instead, his attempt gains the attention of Lilith, queen of demons, who visits him on the dance floor.</lj-cut>

If there's a story I've fallen in love with, it's Elaine's story, which is why I'm very afraid of how it'll be received, and if it's good enough, because it's my baby.

<lj-cut text=""Elaine's story synopsis""><b>Synopsis of God's Hand</b>

Tortured by visions of the demon Mastema plaguing her town with a deadly sickness, Elaine doesn't understand her purpose in seeing the truth.  Her visions guide her to Vivienne, who offers her a choice in how to fight the demon: the sword Excalibur, or its sheathe.  Elaine chooses the sword, but realizes she's no better off when it comes to demon-slaying.  How can a young girl fight a demon who kills silently?</lj-cut>

Elaine: 9025
Victoria: 2583

I didn't dwell too long on the necessary badly-written teen angst period, but I still had it, and my pieces from then are positively awful.  I figured I'd throw them out here for a laugh, or something.  Feel free to tear them apart, because I will be later.  ^_^

"event","I'm going to add a third element to my discussion of the pieces: a self-critique.  It'll do me wonders, and give you all more insight into my thought process as I go through these works again.

In case you missed it earlier: <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/versedsophistry/4948.html?mode=reply"">Fiction Update 2</a>

Just some random information before I dig in:

1) I was accepted into <lj comm=""poetryslamming"">.  I'm a little surprised, because it was more of an experiment than a ""best-foot-forward"" sort of thing.  I put out some of my longest pieces to see how people would respond, and the vote was hairline; I only got in by one.  There's some really good writers on there, and there are some that I really don't care for.  I guess they have some merit, since they were accepted, but...  *shrug*

Actually, some of the critiques I got there were top notch, and made me go back and look at my pieces with a much firmer eye.  I almost want to lose my membership so I can apply again and get more critiques.  Is that bad of me?  :D

Even more surprising to me: I've been active in participating.  I'm not much for elitism of any sort, but I do like being able to help people improve their writing, and that's one way to do it.  And on that note...

2) I've started moderating at <lj comm=""write_away"">, which is a writing workshop community, and one of the very best I've found here on LJ.  As of right now, I throw out weekly prose prompts and critique, critique, critique.  This'll be my third week, and I'm loving it.  It gives me fuel to keep writing, and makes me look critically at others' works, as well as my own.

Anyways, on with the show.

<lj-cut text=""n-dimensional space""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/versedsophistry/3942.html?mode=reply"">n-dimensional space</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

I wrote this while attending the <a href=""http://www.richmond.edu""> University of Richmond</a> early on in the first semester.  Marie had just started <a href=""http://www.scad.edu"">SCAD</a>, and I was feeling absolutely miserable in the fear that she would forget about me, lose sense of my love, or abruptly end the relationship, as she hinted she was beginning to happen.  I was also reveling in my Modern Physics class.  The thoughts and feelings brewed together in brain, and this was the result.

Originally, it had about four more stanzas of gibberish about the nature of light, human nature, insane images, allusions to Milton, and what have you.  I dropped them, because even though some of the lines had worth, they just didn't fit with the idea of this poem at all.  I have them in a separate file, waiting to be turned into another poem.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

Mostly, I'm playing with the relativity aspects of light.  At first I'm making a conceit of it with love, but eventually turn towards it as a revealing illumination, burning away ignorance and doubt and darkness, leaving only my darling and I together.

<b>Self-critique</b>

<i>constance</i>

Is that even a word?  Here it's just used to make assonance with the next line, and ends up looking silly.  Definitely a change is in order.

<i>but not in the perfection bound in a prayer.</i>

What a ridiculous line.  It has nothing to do with the rest of the poem, except possibly the Biblical reference at the end, but right here it just sticks out like a sort thumb.  It either needs to be cut, or the idea needs to be moved towards the end.

<i>and there would we be, / brilliantly illuminated.</i>

These boring lines need to be changed, or cut.  They don't add anything as it stands.

Generally, I like the flow and rhythm of the piece, but things need to be condensed.  I see a lot of extraneous words: articles, conjunctions, and the like that just take up space.  I think the ideas are fairly well communicated, so no major surgery need be done, but definitely some cleanup.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Hyperbolic Geometry: Footnote to n-dimensional space""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/versedsophistry/4191.html?mode=reply"">Hyperbolic Geometry: Footnote to n-dimensional space</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

In a link: <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/write_away/234474.html"">this</a>.

A prompt on <lj comm=""write_away""> was to make a dadaist cutup in the style of William S. Burroughs, basically chopping a poem apart and putting it back together randomly to destroy the ""aura"" of the poem and recreate it in a found sense.  So, that's what I did with a stanza of n-dimensional space, but I interlaced it with a paragraph from a physics textbook about cosmological disturbances.  After the big chop suey and gluing phase, this is the result, and I really liked it.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

Your guess is as good as mine as to what the words mean.  Philosophically, it's an expression of the idea that poetry as art doesn't necessarily need to be composed of delibarately phrased words in a work so much as simply stuck together and called a poem.  To put it simply, the dadaist movement makes art a mental process, not a visual one, and the analogy applies to poetry in this case.

<b>Self-critique</b>

I can't do much except critique the purpose of the piece, and that seems unnecessary.  I'll leave it alone.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Upon a Winter's Sweep""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/versedsophistry/4538.html?mode=reply"">Upon a Winter's Sweep</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

Earlier this winter while I was working, I had a feeling, and that feeling led to an observation of a moment, and I knew I had to capture it.  This is the result.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

Simply, it's a series of reflections on the state of life, both mine and in general.  Everything in it is a reflection about life's meaning.  <i>Everything.</i>

<b>Self-critique</b>

Probably the biggest critique others bring to it is that it has no plot and character.  I dismiss that.  This isn't a story; it's a snapshot taken with words, and it fulfills that purpose as a piece.  Not everything needs to be a full-fledged story.

However, there are some things that could use some changing.  The Dostoyevsky I waver on; it brings his works to bear, and the troubled intellectual may fit this piece, but it feels a little heavy-handed.  However, it works perfectly in the sense that it's hoity-toity.  That's a subcurrent that should be running through this piece.

The second paragraph may need to be cut entirely.  It's a good observation, and adds to the mood of the piece, but doesn't add anything thematically.

A huge problem is that most of this takes place in the narrator's mind, with the outside world mostly left up to the reader to fill-in-the-blanks.  I'm not sure if adding imagery will help make the piece more concrete, or take away from the ideas I'm trying to get across.  I'm going to play around with that, for sure.</lj-cut>

Next session is going to be a little different: I went through my archives and found some of my very first works.  Oh the angst, oh the humanity!

That's right.  All next week you'll be seeing my early work, in all of it's terrible and unholy glory.  Feel free to rip it to pieces.  More than likely, I'll agree with you.  ^_^"

"event","Well, it's that time again!  Yessirree, the second installment of Discuss the Pieces.  Yes, there are only three pieces this time.  Yes, it was intentional.

I write stories, but I can't post them here without getting into sticky copyright issues, and while I could make them friends only, I have no desire to.  I can, however, post excerpts and updates on the stories I'm currently working on, and I like doing that, so that shall take the place of one of my pieces between every fifth post.  In case you missed it the first time: <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/2448.html?mode=reply"">last batch's fiction update</a>.

And now, onto the pieces, again in reverse chronological order.

<lj-cut text=""Boston 2003""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/2642.html?mode=reply"">Boston 2003</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

I wrote this piece early last year (sometime in March) after a visit to the city, during which I did a lot of walking and observing and thinking.  I was both fascinated and disturbed by what I saw, and felt that if this didn't come down in poetic form, then I would suffer some horrible and unspeakable fate like dysgraphia.  I don't know why I chose this Whitman-esque form; it just seemed to be the best fit.  This actually is one of my favorite works of mine.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

This poem is only nineteen lines, and each one is an image or thought inspired by my exploration of the city.  I'll take it line by line.

The first line is my impression of the streets themselves, taking the system of them as a whole.  The second was mostly an image I had of people in the entertainment district late at night.  It was very dark and bright at the same time and really stuck with me.  The third line was inspired from watching the people interact (or not) with each other as they walked through the streets, and also just noticing all the diffierent and similar coats people wore.  The next was my impression as I took the time to look into their eyes as they walked past.  Eyes are windows to the soul, you know.

Line five is where I get weird and start addressing the city and the reader as one.  Line six is me taking an image and making it symbolic.  I really did just happen to notice an empty liquor bottle sitting on the corner of a salted stoop, and the image stuck with me.  It seemed to speak an awful lot, and I could probably write a poem just about it.  Line seven is a bit of flash fiction taken from stories my mother told me as a kid, realistic fantasies I made up, and the general feeling I had around me at the time.

I like girls, if you couldn't tell from line eight.  Marie may be my darling love, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate another female.  Actually, I look at them more as interesting people than sex interests.  People just fascinate me, but since I have an affinity for women especially, and I felt like making a subtle statement about gender roles altogether, I said it the way I did.

You see a lot of bums in Boston.  Line nine has to do with stories I've read and had told of beggars who are actually quite wealthy and make a living off of the false pretenses of begging.  This struck me, so I included it.

It was cold from all the wind, and it felt like the streets and buildings served as pipes to focus it.  That's all line ten was about.  Line eleven, however, was meant to be contrasted with line nine, although I didn't want them juxtaposed because it felt like I was clubbing the reader over the head.  I wanted them to make the connection, but that wasn't the point of including it.  I was telling two separate stories, and each one helped reinforce the other; I was making no moral judgments, and placing the two lines next to each other would have conveyed that sort of thing much more strongly.  Anyways, this bum I actually did see.  I'm one of those bleeding hearts, and felt quite terrible every time I had to pass a homeless guy by, but this one really just tore my heart out.  I hope I conveyed something of that confusion I felt here.

Line twelve is about the standard oppression of the city.  I like the rhythm and sound of this line, especially at the end.  By the way, ""stretching one mile to ten"" refers to the fact that a building takes a limited space and makes it into much more space by having multiple stories.  Some readers had trouble grasping that, though I can hope it's discernable with a little bit of thinking.

The next line is about a town square, a city park, or a plaza.  I don't know what the official name for the specific one I had in mind is.  All I know is that it was a wide open space with statues and planted trees.

Am I talking to the city or the reader in line fourteen?  Heh, the ambiguity was there throughout, and this line just really highlights it.  The sex makes it leap out, and the last bit introduces officially one of the main ideas of this poem.

In line fifteen, the city is beladen with a sexual metaphor.  Very sexual, with only a hint of rape.  Sorry; it just seemed to work here.  However, the point of this wasn't that (that was just an aside comment), but the fact that if a problem is made common knowledge, people will ignore it and refuse to see it as a problem.  I use a common slogan to reinforce this.

Line sixteen is very Buddhist, very Zen in its layout.  However, I'm neither arguing for either passion or tranquility, but an understanding and acceptance without losing the drive for improvement.

Line seventeen plays off the joke that everyone delegates responsibility until all of the world's work rests in the hands of some poor benighted fool to whom all the work eventually gets delegated to.  I'm simply asking, what would happen if this poor schmuck took a sick day?  He certainly deserves it, I imagine.

This line starts off with the Kafka and quickly becomes a bitter satire that is what the entire poem was leading up to.  It's a very complex and angry tearing down of nearly every institution that we supposedly hold dear.  And the last line is meant to be memorable and really drive the point home.  I hope it did so.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Light Explosive""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/2173.html?mode=reply"">Light Explosive</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

It came from a prompt in Creative Writing class.  The teacher gave the first line, and told us to keep it down to ten lines or less, so I ran with it and this is what came out.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

Plainly, it's describing a lightning bolt.  Asbru is another name for Bifrost, which is the Nordic bridge between heaven and earth, and I didn't want to say ""a bridge between heaven and earth.""  I mean, how cliche is that?  So, I decided to go with Asbru, since it's a rainbow bridge, and reinforces the idea of light here.  I did, however, like the heaven and earth bit, and thought it made it much clearer, so with a bit of playing with the words (the syntax is <i>very</i> important in that line) I made it fit.

Yes, my writing simply exudes sex like a dark parking lot after prom.  Leave me alone.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Deconstruction of the Internet Poet""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/1809.html?mode=reply"">Deconstruction of the Internet Poet</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

In a link: <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/write_away/215831.html"">this</a>.

I gave up arguing with him, because it's clear this guy is abyssmally stupid.  Instead I went off and wrote an essay about him and tried to refrain from making any more comments when he posted poetry.  Argh.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

I hate bad poetry, especially bad angsty Goth poetry.  I got to use my bombastic and cutting prose voice to full effect here, and I really enjoyed doing it.

This seems to have been my best received piece, interestingly enough.  :D</lj-cut>

And that does it for this installment.

Again, I'd like to encourage you that if you're reading, please feel free to leave constructive criticism.  I want my works to grow, and not just sit here."

"event","The internet has become a breeding ground of faux poets who -- in light of their banding together and mindless birdlike calling of praise -- believe themselves invested with some sort of talent.  In reality, their ""art"" is merely a composition of vague words bemoaning some undefined ""pain,"" ""rage,"" or perceived insult -- whether by parents, peers, or any other aspect of society is often left unmentioned, remarkably like anything else that could be misconstrued as substance in their writing.

Most frustrating of all is when attempts are made to make note of these things to the ""poet"" in a foolish attempt to make his writing stand out from the mass of unwashed and unmemorable verse (since that is one of the fundamental definitions of poetry: memorable verse); he becomes irate and defensive of his precious child.  This is, after all, understandable, but when it occurs so incredibly often in nearly exactly similar circumstances, his defense becomes that of the clown's buffoonery mocking itself with endless and tiresome repetition: pitably laughable.

It never ceases to amaze me the amount of people who will rush to the poet's defense, though it should come as no surprise since they are of like mind and there are many many terrible poets of the vague pain.  Whereas the poet in offense claims he is vague to make his poem more appreciable to the public (since they can relate to his feelings of experience, though maybe not experience itself) and allow for greater interpretation, his stalwarts will howl that the poet is developing his own style and how <i>dare</i> anyone even imagine infringing upon a poet's inalienable freedom to write filth.

While the poet's objections may be true, he might as well be writing pop metal songs of thrashing guitars, incoherent rage, and undefined pain, because the only difference is that one has some mocking semblance of music and the other possibly a terrible rhyme scheme, though the fact that mocking semblances shamble within each is no coincidence.  Both forms are simple pop culture mind candy, grasping generational constants of alienation, anger, and doubt, and what the suger-rushed consumers of these lackluster poems and songs fail to appreciate is that they are being used by the music industry and abused by the festering diseases upon humankind they deem their wretched intellects.

What probably does not need mentioning amidst this treatise is that these offending poems are an assault upon the English language, bloodying with ham-fists the sensibilities of sound that are the writer's tools.  They are so laden with vagueness, cliche, and simplistic unoriginality that they neither stand out nor are even memorable in the long annals of writing.  What has become universally praised is mere bourgeois sentiment, destroying the literary foundation this culture has been building throughout its history.  While I am all in support of necessary and beneficial change, this movement venerating broken and worn-down simulacra of angst holds no benefits but the glorification of the pathetic, mediocre, and unworthy.

The true writer -- as opposed to what I disrespectfully deem the poet -- doesn't linger on these transitory vestiges left behind by an awkward body and confused mind, but instead uses them as tools when necessary to subtly motivate their writing.  Pain, anger, and the like are scalpels to incise and invite the psyche of the reader, not bludgeons designed to deaden his insensibility mistaken as comfort.  There are many ways to write, and many things to write about: images, moments, ideas, stories; and yet the basics of each have been so well and so long expounded upon that to once again drag such a dead horse through the streets is bordering on the profane.

The writer must not ignore his literary roots, nor his grasp on the language that he uses as a medium -- would it not be folly for the painter to ignore the all the various uses and manipulations of his paint? -- but instead embrace them, whether he intends to use them as building blocks for something more complex and sublime or as examples of what he would like to tear down.  Writers need not sycophantically worship the writing of the past, but neither should they be ignorant of it, raving like lunatics of pains and injuries that nobody else can conceive of in a paltry attempt at group therapy that makes them feel so cool for being so utterly alone.  Poems that fulfill such a debased purpose have no business masquerading themselves as true writing.  Call it what it is: psychological bile; and leave the writing to those who seek it as an art, and not as a reanimation of the trite and hackneyed."

"event","Well, as I promised, my fifth entry will be a review of the previous works.  ""What!?"" you exclaim.  ""There's only three pieces, and one of them is only two lines!""

Quiet your insolence.  Just count the entries; this will be number five, and the previous prose line counts because I say so.  So there.

Two sections per piece: ""Where did this come from?"" and ""What does it mean?""  As a writer, I'm fascinated with the first when others are willing to divulge such precious secrets.  As a reader, I usually like to know the second, and when it comes to writing like mine, which can be pretty abstruse at times, a little guide from the wrtier can help a bit, but I didn't want to give it <i>all</i> away when I posted, which is why I'm doing this fifth entry thing.

<i>Any</i>ways, I'm reviewing things in the reverse order of their posting.  Why?  Because I want to.  I hope you enjoy it (though sometimes I feel like I'm typing into a void with my writing...)

<lj-cut text=""Notebook(1)""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/1186.html?mode=reply"">Notebook(1)</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

Well, that's a simple one.  This little ditty came from my notebook which I'm required to keep for my creative writing class.  We're supposed to write in it journal-style at least once a day with whatever we'd like to write.  The only requirement is that it must be at least eight words long.  Not too hard.

This one came about from an image I saw as I was driving that I just wanted to capture, and prose seemed like a better way than poetry at the time, so this is what I wrote.  I thought it was a succinct image worth sharing, so I did.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

It's just an image of birds flying across the road.  I tried to capture a snapshot of their motion, a kind of dual stillness in their movement.  I don't know.  I think the piece, short as it is, speaks for itself.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Lifespans""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/954.html?mode=reply"">Lifespans</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

This poem was written maybe a year ago in the springtime.  I was reading <a href=""http://www.well.com/user/eob/poetry/The_Second_Coming.html"">The Second Coming</a> by William Butler Yeats and an idea sprang into my mind about shadows and love and mountains and butterflies and something vague about the antichrist mixed in.  You know.  <i>That</i> sort of thing.

This is the result, free of shadows and antichrists, but very butterfly and mountain-ful.  I actually did some arcane mathematical calculations involving the relative lifespans of butterflies and humans and assuming they flapped their wings (I think) four times a second.  I kept on wanting to put this dark allusion to the poem that spawned it at the end, but it just completely ruined the wonderous creation that I had wrought.  I couldn't bring myself to do it, and so it was left as a happy nature poem, and better for it, I think.

<b>What does it mean?</b>

Well, the basic premise of the whole piece is comparing the relative lifespans of the butterfly and child, noting the wonder that the child has for the butterfly, and then shifting the relationship to fit the child and mountain, hinting that the wonder also exists for the slumbering mountain.

I especially like the second stanza in which the speed of a butterfly's thought is contemplated.  Do their thoughts go only as fast as ours?  Are they faster, so that they get the same amount of thoughts as us, but only in a more compact time?  Just how long <i>is</i> a flap of a wing to a butterfly?  I can't answer them, which is why I raise those questions instead in the piece.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Amorous Alchemy""><a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~versedsophistry/513.html?mode=reply"">Amorous Alchemy</a>

<b>Where did it come from?</b>

We were supposed to write a poem in Creative Writing class about this picture in the first chapter of our book.  I kind of did, but really the picture is only found in the first three lines and loosely in the rest of it.  The rest, I guess, is the result of some psychic disturbance I needed to get out.  Also, I'd been reading <a href=""http://eliotswasteland.tripod.com/"">The Wasteland</a> by T.S. Eliot (again), so I'm certain that snuck into it.

<b>What <i>the hell</i> does it mean?</b>

Well, this is going to be fun.

The title tells you right from the beginning that alchemy is at work here, and all throughout the poem you'll find allusions to various alchemical principles.  The point of all this dark ages mumbo jumbo was to transmute lead into gold, and the thought was the same process might be applied to life, which is what the narrator is trying to do with his experience.  The key is in the very first line with the word ""putrefaction,"" literally meaning in alchemy that the lead-based substance being worked on will decompose into shit before it turns into gold.  Later on, the combustion and crucible are processes and pieces that are used to hopefully turn the mixture into gold.  In this case, those things are the love and frenzied passionate moment between the two, which the narrator hopes will serve to transform their relationship into the proverbial gold.  Purification is also an important alchemical principle; alchemists believed it was simply a matter of bringing a substance into a more pure state to make it more precious (ie lead was only very impure gold).  Coincidentally, they believed the same applied to the human soul in its endeavors to reach God, and the narrator may have believed it applied to human relationships.  The final important principle is that of Sophia, which means literally Wisdom.  It's a female principle, and the one which, when mated with the male, produces the most pure and greatest of all forms in whatever medium you're working in.  All alchemists strive to include Sophia in their work.  Also, she's the Gnostic goddess which birthed the wicked Yaldaboth -- or the Demiurge -- who created our impure world to deceive our souls as they seek to travel higher towards the pleroma, or heaven.

Beyond that, I'll take it stanza by stanza, since this is broken into two of them.

The first stanza is the moments preceding a romantic and probably sexual encounter, likely with someone the narrator is intimately familiar.  The dialogue implies some sort of familiarity, as well as a mixture of insecurity and subdued hysteria between the two.  He gets her a present, which is likely to one or both of them only garbage, and she accepts it with a smile saying that the feeling matters, that the implication that he cherishes her and shows it with this gift pleases her, because she desperately desires to be cherished.  The lips are soft, fleshy, wrinkled, and most importantly sibylene.  I didn't include that word simply because it sounded good; sibyls were Greek prophetesses, and in this case, those wrinkled lips foretold the future in both their luscious desirability and the fact that her flesh would become like them with age.  As the two pairs of lips meet, the world combusts, starting the alchemic process of purification through fire and crucible, and some hot and randy sex.

The second stanza is the ""morning after.""  The narrator is playing with the ashes of last night's encounter (Ooh, so dark), which are still comforting in their failure.  He hints that he likes the pain when he answers her question, and tells her that even if gold is impossible, he wants to work towards the best thing that <i>is</i> within their grasp: diamonds.  These diamonds are, of course, scattered amidst the ashes of the amorous encounter, and forgotten as the two proceed to become amorous again, where the poem presumes they will be purified, either to start again, or to be brought to that higher state.  Of course, diamonds are never as satisfactory as gold (to an alchemist, diamonds meant nothing at all), and while they are desperately grasped as a substitute, they still cut, and it's that blood, that pain that brings the process to its completion, does the trick and turns the world into gold for them.

Of course, I think the poem itself is prettier, but if you were really confused before, maybe you can take this understanding to a rereading of it and hopefully appreciate it better.  If you had your own take, though, I bet it's just as valid, and I'd love to hear it.  I'm always interested to see how my work will be interpreted.</lj-cut>

Well, that's it.  My first installment of discussing the pieces is all done, and I hope you enjoyed it.  I really would appreciate some feedback, if not on the pieces, then on what you thought of my feedback, whether you thought it was interesting/waste of time/fun to read/etc.  It took me a good hour to compile all of this and write it down, and it's not often a magician (or writer, as it were) divulges his secrets, so I really do hope you enjoyed this treat."

"event","This being the first entry, I shall introduce myself briefly to those of you who may not know me and explain the purpose of this journal.

My name is Adam, and I'm a professed writer, at first by nature and inclination, now by choice.  This journal is here as a writing journal, to provide electronic space devoted solely to my writings in whatever shape they may take form.  Another purpose is hopefully get some sort of audience interested in reading and critiquing my pieces.  Generally, I write poetry despite my desire not to inflict such things upon the world, and would like to focus more on fiction.  I do aspire to write professionally some day, so anyone who reads and comments would be appreciated.

As far as comments go, constructive criticism is most appreciated.  However, gut reactions are also good in lieu of the former.  Even if you can't tell me how to improve it, telling me how it made you feel is something I can work with.  What I don't want is effusive praise.  There are plenty of writers elsewhere who are looking for people to tell them, ""gj ur soooo good lol.""  No thanks.

An interesting bit, I think, will be that every fifth entry I will devote to talking about my previous writings: where they came from, how they evolved, why I wrote them, and -- in the case of more obtuse writing -- what any of it means.  I know that I've always been fascinated in hearing this from other writers, so I hope others will have the same interest when I share it.

So, if you're here and willing to stay and read my meagre offerings, you have my profuse thanks, and I welcome you to my humble little space.

Cheers!"

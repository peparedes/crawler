"event","buffy summers?  buffy summers!  you - you stop now and tell me where your annoying yet useful friend willow is.  i need her assistance with something that i'm entirely too busy to explain to you.  shoo!  go get her...er...tiger.

hey!  hey!  buffy summers!  why are you wearing the same sweater that i'm wearing.  that's strange.  if i had...oh, say found it instead of going into a department store and exchanging money for goods i'd probably think that that was even more peculiar that you have the same strange frilly sweater that i do..."

"event","an alleyway behind the burnt out ruin of sunnydale high:

""you!

you're spike!  and a demon - not in the good, socially useful way!  and you have demon face!  aaah!  you've been eating...cereal?

well, that's less threatening then.  hello, spike.  how are you, and what brought you to the place where i've been enjoying some much needed solitude to eat cereal with a deceptively alarming expression?"""

"event","i was going to talk to xander harris and coyly convince him to be of assistance, but then giles stuck his head out the window, and after that, a large, glowering and vaguely familiar man came out of the bushes and xander seemed all preoccupied.

so instead i went away, and i wound up at the high school.  actually, i wound up at the charred ruin.  it sounded like someone else was there too.  i hid in the...well the outer part of the charred ruin for an uncomfortable amount of time as they clearly hadn't left yet.

when i woke up it was morning, and i was wearing an sweater that was warm but somewhat unflattering."

"event","aargh!  i *hate* this town!

first i find giles and he's grouchy and evasive.

than i follow giles home and find xander harris, but he's singing and therefore probably insane.  i made many a worthless man crazy in my demon days, and those who weren't crying in agony did sing sometimes.

if he's crazy, i shouldn't bother asking him to help me...unless i should because a crazy person might be easily influenced...or freakishly strong and also belligerent...

i *hate* this town!

""xander!  xander harris!  ""*singing* xander harris, hey!"""

"event","i found giles.

well, he came over and asked ""anya is that you,"" and that's when i...

giles is now located.

and bitter.  maybe it's the unemployment and the casual sweaters.

he didn't have to  be so rude.

anyway, i followed him home.  not in a sexy way though, if that's what you're thinking.  and not in a maybe i can contrive to bump into him again and thereby locate xander harris way either.  no, i actually need somebody useful right now, and that person is so not either of them, which i realized when giles was all ""i must go home and fail to be of any use to you"" and ""i will stand here and be british and disapproving.""

but i thought that maybe if i knew where to find giles that i'd know where to find willow, who despite her whole annoying goody-two shoes won't restore a gal to a hell dimension arbitrary morality, may be able to help me.  she liked casting that spell...until she freaked.  i think getting on her good side would be wise.  i wonder if she likes...various things in this dismal alley...  hm."

"event","mexico, perhaps slightly less prone to apocolypse than sunnydale, was still much closer to the ascension than i had hoped i might be.

when i told xander harris that i believed it was a better thing to be farther away from the actual-sized demon, i was thinking of someplace more along the lines of belgium, which is not only much farther away from sunnydale than many other places but much less attractive to the supernatural.

but, no.  when i got to the airport, it was all ""miss where is your small plastic card giving you permission to leave the country"" and ""pummelling me will only land you in prison.""  stupid humans.  if the mayor did turn into a large, hungry demon, i was hoping he would eat them first.  they'd probably be all ""no being a horrible monstrosity without your little plastic passcard.""

anyway, i went to mexico instead, to hopefully not be eaten and also to get a nice tan.  the bus is a rather unpleasant conveyance.  i should not have spent my money on that, but really, who can think in a consumer-savy way when big apocolyptic death is supposed to be nigh?

now i am tan.  and this ascension was very little like the last one, what with most people still being alive afterwards.

oh, and the school blew up.  but, really, that was pretty much it.

i'm glad that i wasn't eaten and that very few other people were eaten.  now, i think it's time to focus on some other problems.  like that passcard which i don't have...much like money and other things that are supposed to make human life more pleasant.

so i suppose it's time to go talk to that giles and willow and all those other people whose fault it is that i'm a non-demon with a lack of sufficient identification."

"event","Hey.

I'm back from Colorado. The vacation was, honestly, quite awkward. Not only because I was an idiot and packed the wrong clothes (WHY did I think skirts and heels would work in the mountains?!?)but more because I have recently found it difficult to function as a part of my family. I'm kinda in a stage in my life where I am really enjoying my independence and freedom, and it is becoming more and more difficult for me to give that up and become part of the Wilson clan again. Plus, I'm at an awkward age: too old (and not patient enough) to hang with the little kids, but ""too young"" to be considered an adult. So I get to hang with...myself. Remind me to never go on another family vacation again.

You guys, when we get back to school, I have a ton of stories to tell you all. Be prepared.

Getting emails and random messages from my Cornell friends has only made me even more excited to get back up to Iowa. I have a REALLY good feeling about this year (actually, that's a bad sign, but I'm ignoring that fact). Last year, I was still a little sad to leave home, but this year, well...I'm ready to get out of here. Honestly, the only things I think I'll miss will be my car and my dog. And living in a city. Thats about it.

I have become such a loser this summer. Honestly, my life mostly consists of me working, reading, and sleeping. And sometimes going out, but thats becoming more and more rare as the summer comes to a close. A lot of times, my friends and I will get together to, like, watch a movie. Or go out to eat. How boring. What has happened to my life?!? I remember it being much more exciting than this. What happened to all the drinking and club-hopping and partying and, well...other things? You know your life is sad when you can't wait to get to Mt. Vernon to have some fun :(

I miss you all and hope everyone is doing super good. If you love me, you should definitely pray for rain in KC this weekend...I'm getting sick of driving around on that beer cart:)"

"event","I can honestly say that I am at my happiest right now.

Work is going remarkably well. I am not working near as much as I did last year, but I am okay with that because now I don't have to feel like I've become a slave to this damn country club. The people are great; its amazing the friends you make when you just learn to be yourself. Had a little trouble last week with a few of the guys on the course; just cause I'm the ""beer cart girl"" doesn't mean you get to treat me like trash. But its okay, cause it only made me stronger and respect myself more. I've learned not to let people treat me like shit anymore.

Life is also going remarkably well right now. My friends are great; hanging out with them is great because they bring out a side of me that I absolutely love. I've also been spending a lot of time alone, which is nice because I don't get a lot of that over the school year. Lots of reading and writing and thinking being done. No substances whatsoever-I'm enjoying life sober. Actually- I'm living life fairly low-key and somehow finding ways to still have fun. I suppose I'm spending this summer just figuring things out for a little while. Its nice.

Still can't wait to get back to school though. Still trying to find time to head up there and visit you all at some point this summer. I'll try and keep you posted...:)"

"event","""This is not goodbye she said, it is just time for me to rest my head...""-Marroon Five
I know, I know. Its been awhile since you all've heard from me. I'm sorry for being so anti-social, but honestly, I was in desperate need of a break. I needed a good, long month away from everything that is Cornell College. I needed some time to myself. However, I realized yesterday that my break was over; that I as much as I try to deny it, I need some Cornell in my life every once in awhile.(How did I realize this? My dad and I were trying to come up with unique and different names for my future sons, and my dad suggested I name one of them Bartholomew...and suddenly, I missed Cornell with all my heart.)
So how have I been spending the last month of my life? Um...work is going well, except for the fact that they've decided to limit the beer cart hours to weekends only. This means that I have a choice to make: work fewer hours or switch to working banquets during the weekdays. This has caused some un-neccessary stress in my life and has given me deeper sympathy for people who've been laid off due to job cuts. I've fallen in love with a lot of new things since I've left Cornell: coffee shops, reading, country music, diet cherry limeades, Gavin DeGraw, old reruns of Dawson's Creek, Before Sunrise, and playing the piano. So...this is what my life has mostly consisted of so far this summer. Its been...inspiring. I love it.
Hope everyone else is doing well.Honestly, there not much else for me to write about...I've been enjoying this calm that has taken over my life. Its given me time to, well, be happy for a little while."

"event","I am soooo happy that I have surrounded myself with good people. If I honestly look at the people that I have relationships with (serious, close relationships that is) I have some of the greatest friends in the world. I don't know if I am good at judging people's character or just really lucky, but most, if not all, of my friends are good, decent people. I watch people around me and look at their friendships, and I think, wow. If my friendships were like that I'd shoot myself. Its so unbelievably fake. I love that with all of my friends, I can be as stupid as I want and (hopefully) no one ever thinks any less of me. I love that even though I can be such a loser, I have people around me that don't care. Some people define their friends as people that they enjoy hanging out with. I define my friends as people that I have a connection with. I don't just ""go out"" with my friends and see movies or go shopping and talk about boys and ""the kids"" and our lives. I have some really unbelievable conversations about life and people and, well, ""real"" things. I have friends that challenge me. Thats nice. It is so comforting to know that if I ever mess up (which I do A LOT), there are people in this world that have my back. People that, for the rest of my life, will always be there for me. And I will always be there for them. Its the difference between just having friends you hang out with, and friends that you will have for life. And while I have both kinds of friendships, I really heart (sorry Gabby) my real ones."

I am SOOOO excited right now!!!! Why? Because 1.)I just talked to my best friend Bryonha and talking to her always puts me in a good mood, and 2.) I just realized how much I have to look forward to in the next few months. First off, I am in the bestest class ever right now -a class that requires practically no outside work. Second, in two weeks, I will be on my way to Phoenix, where the temperature is 75 degrees and where my only worries will involve what time I head to the pool and what kind of alcoholic drink will I enjoy with my older brother and my dad. Then, well, I have to come back here and take Virginia Woolf. Not fun. BUT THEN, guess what? I AM GOING TO ITALY!!!!!! I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!! AND after that, its SUMMER!!! A summer filled with golf carts and money and hot older men and tips and flirting and going out with my friends and Kansas City and Jeremy (?) and my own car and my wonderful dog and...well, everything else that goes along with summer. I AM SO EXCITED. 
I live such a blessed life. :)"

You know what I did for my 16th birthday? I think I had, like, 4 friends over. We went to a movie and had a sleepover. It was an excellent time. These girls, on the other hand, were each allowed to spend half a million dollars on a party to which they invited 700 people. And they hired Pauly Shore and Linkin Park just to show up. Grrr...people make me sick.
I complain about living in the midwest way too much. At least here I'm surrounded by decent people. At least I am satisfied with just having a few friends over to celebrate my birthday. At least my mom didn't buy me strippers for my sweet sixteen. Ew...God, this show makes me so satisfied with my boring little life."

-yay for realizing happiness when its right in front of you and not later when you're looking back on things...
Hope everyone else had wonderful days themselves. Sorry if this overwhelmingly happy entry annoys you...it just seems like I don't get days like these very often and I plan to enjoy them when I do."

"event","Two weeks left til Christmas. What perfect timing; not too long, not too short. So far, I am really enjoying this block and I plan to keep that up. This is a perfect ""Christmas Season"" block. However, there are a few things in my life that I need to stop doing, if not forever, than at least for the rest of this block.
THINGS I WILL NOT DO FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS:
1.) I need to stop spending money. I seem to have forgotten that I am planning to go to Europe next semester and have, therefore, spent a bajillion dollars this past month. This has got to stop. 
2.) I need to stop being lazy. Not just with exercising (although I do need to do a lot of that this month), but just in life. I have become such a lazy person, and thats really not gonna get me anywhere in life.
3.) I need to treat people better, aka stop being selfish. Christmas is the perfect time to start that...
4.) I need to stop eating.
5.) I need to stop complaining about things. Things like boys, Cornell, sex (lack of, that is), money, food, my family, Pfeiffer...no one really wants to hear it.
6.) Actually, I just need to stop thinking about boys in general. And over Christmas break, I vow to NOT answer the phone when a certain someone calls. I WILL NOT be that girl.
There we go. My list of things I will not do this season. They appear easier than they really are, especially that last one. Now my non-lazy self is going to go running, then come back and get started on my final paper for this block. Yay for making self-improvements..."

"event","So I have a funny story to tell you. Its called ""Wow..did I really go to kareoke with the Delphis last night?"" I kinda wish you guys had been there, cause it was funny. You all would have gotten a laugh out of it.
Let's see...last night started in Lauren Kott's room, where everyone else played drinking games while I watched and laughed at them in my wonderful sober state. I have this rule: No drinking on school nights. So, don't worry, I was stone cold sober the whole night. Joe Baker came in at one point, and I realized that he is probably the most arrogant, self-absorbed person I have ever met. He also happens to be a pretty big flirt when he's drunk...that was pretty amusing. We then decided to head down to the bars, which basically consisted of me (again, the only sober one) leading a huge drunk group of people through Mt. Vernon. Got to the bar, and the first person I saw was Jim Thompson. Wonderful. 
Walking into the Hilltop is always real uncomfortable for me. Hell, just being in the Hilltop is always uncomfortable. Its such a weird little bar. We got there, sat down in a booth, and things were good for awhile. I decided that Kareoke night must be sooo much more fun when your drunk. I felt pretty damn stupid being so damn sober. Saw my ""across the hall neighbors"". That's what they called me, I'm ""across the hall neighbor"" to them. Both came up to give me a high five...God, I love drunk people. The highlight of the night was when the Delphis made me get up with them to sing kareoke. We didn't sing just one song, mind you; no, we definatley sang five. And I was soooo not in the mood for kareoke. Somewhere in the middle of ""Baby Got Back"", I kinda just gave up. I was too damn tired and too damn sober for that. I kinda hid in the back, mindlessly mumbling so that I would appear to be singing. I kinda hoped I would just fade into the crowd, but then I remembered: Oh wait, thats right, I'm wearing a BRIGHT PINK HAT on my head. God dammit...
I was ready to go home by 12:30. We left at 2:00. Got to see some dude throw up all over the sidewalk, got to search the Hilltop for Nikki's camera (which, by the way, was found later...in her back pocket), got to spend some quality time with Casey Jones (lucky me), got to freeze my ass off taking everyone home...I'm never being sober at Kareoke again. I think my rule is going to have to change..."

"event","You guys- its Christmas. I am soooooo excited, almost to the point where its kinda become ridiculous. Don't worry, I've already started to make plans for this Christmas season, and you all are invited. 

Things I want to do before Christmas Break:
1.) Listen to Christmas music as much as possible. (Thank goodness my wonderful roommate loves it just a much as I do...)
2.) Make hot chocolate and watch a Christmas movie. (My recommendation-Christmas Vacation)
3.) Drive around and look at all the Christmas lights.
4.) Go get an Egg Nog Milkshake at Steak and Shake. (True, I did this last night, but I wanna do it again...)
5.) Go Christmas shopping at Coral Ridge. (I doubt any of you get a thrill out of crowds like I do, but I love shopping during the Christmas season. Provides some awesome people watching time.)
6.) Christmas sing-along!!!!!!!!!! Sarah and I will love this...
6.) Theta Phi Beta formal in Bloomington, Illinois. Don't front, cuz I am so excited.

So, I realize this is kinda a lot of stuff, but, seriously guys, we can do it. (By the way, Mandy, my goal this year is to somehow get you to like Christmas. So, plan to join us on each of these activities. I'm forcing you to come.)C'mon, get excited guys!!! You know you love it..."

"event","I've decided that Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. Why? Well, first off, Thanksgiving is basically a excuse to stuff yourself full of good food, and as we all know, I am always up for that. Second, Thanksgiving break seems to be just long enough. Not too long, cause I'd start getting bored or used to being back home and not want to come back to Cornell. And, when its over, you don't have to be sad, cause hey, Christmas is less than 3 weeks away. Yes, Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday...
Wish something incredably exciting happened over my break, cause then I'd have something fun to write about in here. Don't get me wrong, it was a lot of fun...but pretty damn typical. Here's an overview, more for my sake than yours. If I don't write it down, I'll forget.
Wednesday: Class. Sat on my ass for, oh, 5 hours waiting to leave Cornell. That was just as horrible as I predicted. Then drove to KC. Surprisingly, seemed like a really quick trip. Drove with Glynnis and Stephanie(?) from 2nd floor. They talked about pot a lot. I slept. Got back home. Saw my ""challenged"" dog who now has no recollection of me whatsoever. My friends came over. Got to meet Taylor, the dreaded boyfriend. Nice guy, but its hard for me to see my friends with their new boyfriends. It only brings on the inevitable feeling of loneliness and being left behind. Drank. A lot. Of my parents alcohol. Good times. 
Thursday: Woke up. Helped my mom with the Thanksgiving dinner. My aunt and her family came. Good to see them. Tried to play with the new baby. Decided that I am going to be the worst mother in the whole wide world. Ate. A LOT. Hung out, watched TV, the typical Thanksgiving stuff. Later that night, watched Love Actually with my mom and aunt. Once again, inevitable feeling of loneliness.
Friday: Shopping. Eating. Buying new clothes. Seeing people I really didn't want to see. Reminded me that I really hate being surrounded by gorgeous, rich people. Later that night, rented Cabin Fever (I'm serious, if you haven't seen this movie yet, we need to plan a night to watch it. I've never laughed so hard in my whole life. Greatest horror film ever made.) Watched that with my friends. Again, damn good times.
Saturday: Watched Disney movies. Thats right, I spent my afternoon watching Sleeping Beauty and The Lion King. Don't make fun of me, you know you wish you were there. That night, went to the Plaza. Ate at Kona Grille. Walked around the Plaza with all the Christmas lights and stuff. Went to Skies, which is always a fun time. Heard about a party at Grinham's, so we drove all the way out to the country to her house. Got there, and there was no party. Never felt more stupid in my life.
Sunday: Church at 7:30am. Never want to be up that early again. Packed up. Left. Spent the ride home listening to the Beatles and talking about pot (again). It was the perfect car ride for Gabbie.
Like I said, nothing exciting. Sorry. Some of it was fun, some not. Lots of lonely moments. Basically, I need a boyfriend. I think my parents are getting worried. Hope they don't think I'm a lesbian!"

"event","So...this Thanksgiving is going to be really bad. I can already tell. There are all sorts of little signs that seem to be hinting that this really isn't going to be as fun as I was hoping for. And my life ALWAYS follows the signs.
Here are those signs:
1.) I'm excited for it. In my life, the things I get really excited for always end up disappointing me. Its the things I'm dreading that often end up being more fun than I thought. 
2.) My best friend Vickie is bringing her boyfriend home for the holiday. I don't like him. True, I've never met him, but I've heard stories and I don't like all the things he's done to hurt her. I don't think this is going to be a good meeting.
3.) So, I can't leave Cornell until 3:30. Thats right, I have to hang out here for 3 1/2 hours doing jack shit before I can even get into a car and drive the 5 HOURS to KC. Grrr...
4.) Won't get to see my brothers over Thanksgiving. They'll be in Salina. Cuz they suck like that.
5.) The Pomeroy show that I have been super duper excited for has now been cancelled for me. Cause I'm not 21. And all my friends and I got our hopes up and everything...
My life sucks. So I'm going to spend the rest of the night pouting about it. Visit if you dare."

"event","Well, thanks to my wonderful roommate's suggestion, I now have something to write about in my entry tonight. 
I was thinking today about how we are going to be graduating before we know it. (Only two and a half more years, guys...) and that got me started... where do I see each of us in 10 years? So I will now attempt to predict our futures as best as I can based on my personal observations and, well, my amazing psychic abilities as well.
Hmmm...who should I start with?

SARAH-Sarah will go to grad school (thats kind of a given). She will be very far away from Chris, and while i imagine this will be extremely difficult for them both, i am confident they will make it through. However, not without a few temptations, I fear...:) Then, she and Chris will move in together; however, due to lack of financial funds, marriage will have to wait a year or two (Sorry, Sarah, its just my predition) They will marry and have to move to California in order to get our dear Chris a well-paying job. Sarah, I'm sure, will not be too keen on this idea; however, since she is such a kind and compromising person, she will, of course, make sacrifices to keep the relationship alive. As far as her occupation goes, I see Sarah as a hard-working business woman working, well, somewhere...the actual field is a bit foggy. Basically, I just see her in a lot of business suits and board meetings. I see Sarah traveling on business a lot, visiting most of the country and maybe even other parts of the world. However, after a few years, this traveling will have to stop thanks to the new baby that will be on the way. (Which, by the way, Sarah, will definately be a boy)

MANDY-This is a hard one. Mandy, your life will be very unconventional. I'm sorry, but I do not see marriage in the near future. (However, I do see many illict affairs...) You will always be a writer; whether it be writing your own book or your own column for a newspaper, people will want to read about your life. You will travel, not in style, but rather adventurously; I see you making your way accross Europe staying in hostels and living out of a backpack. You will be one of those phenomenons, one of those people who has little money but somehow always manage to scrape by (and have fun doing it). You will finally meet someone, but be in no hurry to get married. No need for that commitment. I see you always following your heart and not your head, and this will result in a one very wonderful and exciting life.

GABBY- I DON'T KNOW. I see you moving south, down to Louisiana where you will be near family who will end up being more of a support for you than you may realize now. I don't see you moving down there alone, due to your lack of direction and difficulty navigating in new places (not only on the road, but in general...)I see you living with family (aka. brother, cousins, etc...) in an apartment filled with bright colors and posters of old rockers from the 70s. There, I see you struggling job-wise; I don't see you finding a solid job for awhile. However, I see these first few years being the best time of your life; you will make up for all those years you were stuck in Iowa. When you finally do find that stable job, it will be something to do with art, however, it will have to give you enough time to expand your own creativity in the many forms of art you will pursue. As for marriage, I'm sure you will get married, probably to someone who can deal with your quirks (aka your slow eating and your constant state of being high) However, I don't know when this will happen. Not until you feel completely comfortable with yourself and your own life. Then you will be married, have children, and be that quirky mother other kids think of as really ""cool"" and ""hip"". Art will always be an important medium in your life, I see your house being full of your ""creations"". Others will admire and envy you for your creativity; your husband will adore it.

ME-If I could live a perfect life, this is what it would be:
age 22-24: grad school at KU, where I will live in an apartment with my brother, have a job as a bartender at a local college bar, get a masters in journalism, have a relationship with some beautiful, hot Kansas frat boy that will be fun but not real
age 24-25: Travel in the cast of Les Mis. Be in the chorus of a touring company. (Hey, a girl can dream, can't she?)
age 25-26: NEW YORK CITY. I will move there with my dear friend Bryonha and her musical theatre friends. We will live in some crazy small apartment (typical New York apartment that is), I will work for Cosmopolitan Magazine by day, Stardust Diner by night (diner where all the waiters sing showtunes)have crazy relationships (this will be the Sex and the City part of my life)
age 26-29: meet the love of my life. Live together for awhile. Get married in October (age 27). Live in New York for awhile, however, moving back to the midwest before first child is born. Moving to a suburb of Chicago (preferably Evanston). 
age 30-60: bring up two kids (Lucy and Evan). Become a ""soccer mom"". However, try my very best not to let the suburban life get to me. Staying grounded will be my ultimate goal. Family vacations, graduations, life in general...
age 60-70: Be the perfect grandmother. Basically, be exactly like my grandma. Learn how to cook good food. And sew. 
age 70-80: Travel. Goal in life-try to stay as healthy as possible so that I'll still be able to travel when I'm 70.
age 80-90: die
There is my perfect life. Think its possible, guys?
Hope I didn't offend or disappoint anyone in this entry. Just my predictions guys...let me know what you think."

"event","I don't really know how to begin this entry. I wish that there was some way I could explain all of what has happened over the past 4 days, but thats impossible because 1)I'm not allowed to and 2)You can't understand until you yourself go through it. However, here's a little bit of what i went through this past weekend
Things I HATE about pledging:
-I've got personal space issues. I DO NOT like having to attach myself (literally) to two other people for two straight days. Jesus-we couldn't even go to the bathroom alone...
-I am a person who likes to look good all the time. I like makeup, cute clothes, showers, etc. I DO NOT like rolling around in the mud, wearing the same damn clothes every day, or dragging around a huge ass pom pom everywhere i go
-I love attention. Good attention that is. Bad attention=being put in embarrassing situations in front a huge group of people who I would(normally) be trying to impress. Pledging was FULL of ""bad attention"".
-I am a very independent person. I HATE it when people tell me what to do and where to go every second of the day. STOP
-I am a very very very very private person. I DO NOT like it when people ask me questions and make me talk about things that I don't want to talk about. I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR TWO WEEKS. STOP ASKING ME THESE QUESIONS.

THE ONE AND ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT PLEDGING:
-It made me appreciate my friends. Those people I'm friends with who didn't make me prove myself to them, who didn't make me go through some sort of pledging process in order to hang out with them. I like those people. I respect those people. 

Grr....letting out frustrations is a wonderful thing. Its all behind me now and thats all that matters. I'm a delphi. Don't know how I feel about that, i don't know how i feel about having that label put on me now. I'll decide here in this upcoming month. Thanksgiving is almost here...then Christmas...I am so excited. I'm gonna love this month."

"event","Just wanted to let everyone know...I am almost done with my daily log. 

Thats right, after these next two entries, I will never again have to think about Keats or Tennyson or Rosetti or Stoppard. I am so close...However, I've unfortunately realized that it is rather difficult to write journal entries on works you've actually never read. I stopped reading this past Wednesday, and now its kinda kicking me in the ass. Sucks for me.

I currently have a lot of ducks in my room. Why? I don't know. Cause thats what the Delphis give their pledges. No, its not our mascot. For some reason, we just get ducks. Eh, well, at least its better than lambs...:)

Pledging pledging pledging pledging pledging. How do we feel about these next few days? Honestly, I really don't know. It can't be that bad, can it? I really don't see these nice, friendly girls turning into cold, heartless bitches. Sure they'll yell and make us do stupid stuff, but as long as they aren't outright mean to me, I think I can handle it. To tell you the truth, I'm kinda excited. I think pledging is all about attitude. If I go into it with a good attitude, then maybe it won't be as bad as we all think. Besides, if worse comes to worse, I can always pull out the tears. Serious, sobbing tears. Trust me, they make people cave. Works every time.

So basically, I am so excited for this block to be over I could just scream. This has been the block from hell, and its nice to finally be on the tail-end of it. Hope finals goes well for everyone, good luck to those pledging. I'll be right there with you..."

"event","You guys, I am so scared to grow up. In two years, we'll be graduating. Done. Finished. No more Cornell to fall back on. We'll have to go into the real world. Think about it, I mean, we complain so much about the food at sodexho, but in two years, we'll have to cook our own food. Which, for me, will mean a lot of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Ramen noodles. Oh God, I'll have to clean my own bathroom and wash dishes and stuff...I don't do that. No more Fruitloops...ever. Ha...no more block breaks to look forward to. Oh my God...I am not going to survive. I'm going to die out there, aren't I? I'm gonna end up homeless on the streets. There's absolutely no way I'm gonna get a good job. Think about it, what skills do I have that are going to help me make any money? Nothing. For God's sake, I'm an ENGLISH and FRENCH major...what the fuck do you do with that? To be honest with you, the reason I want to get married sooo bad isn't because I want someone to love me or that I want to plan a beautiful wedding. Its more because I often wonder if there is any other option for me in life. Jeez, if I could just get married right after grad school, then we can move back to KC, live on the Plaza 20 minutes away from my family, and I would never have to worry about things like English Survey II or pledging or any of that stuff. I'll go grocery shopping everyday. I'll take the kids to soccer practice. Everything will be so...easy. So safe. And when I think about that, it calms me down a bit. In reality, I'd love to move to New York, have my own super small apartment with 7 other roommates (rent is real, real high in New York), work as a journalist for some magazine, and live on my own for awhile. But I really don't believe I could do that. I'm too scared.
I'm never gonna leave KC. I'll end up getting married at 23, probably become a mom soon after that,and never learn what its like to be my own person. Sad, isn't it?"

Things I am so sick of right now:
1.English Survey II- I HATE THIS CLASS. I think this will go down as the worst class I've ever taken at Cornell. Well, at least I hope it doesn't get any worse than this...
2.Pledging- I just want it to be over with. Why drag it out for another two weeks?
3.People who tell other people things when its really none of their business. I mean, c'mon, thats really low...
4.This whole I'm gonna lose weight and then gain it all back over the weekend thing I've had going now for about a month. Seriously, its gotta stop
5. My laziness. I mean, when was the last time I went running?
6.I haven't talked to my parents now for exactly one week. I know that for most of you, this is no big deal, but for me...wow, they need to get back from Italy right now.
7. I'm sick of hearing about other people getting laid and once again feeling left behind. Bryonha, this one goes out to you...
8. Grrr..I am so sick of constantly feeling like I'm on the verge of some nervous breakdown...when will this block finally be over?
9. English Survey II-just for further emphasis.
Back to homework. Hopefully, I'll be asleep by four. See you all tomorrow."

One minute I was sitting there listening to her talk about the symbolism in Jane Eyre when all of the sudden my mind drifted off. Before I knew it, I had tears in my eyes. I think it was because I started thinking about all the places I'd rather be right now. Not just for today, but for the rest of this month. I cannot wait for Thanksgiving, cannot wait to go home to see my family and my friends. Really, the thing I most look forward to is knowing that this block is all behind me. Pledging, NATS, English Survey II...I will be so happy when its all over with. I won't have to think about it anymore.
Places I'd rather be right now:
1.)I'd give anything to be on the beer cart right now. I cannot believe how much I miss that damn golf cart.
2.)I want to go to Chili's. I could really use some corn right now...
3.)I want to go back to English AP. I can't believe how much I complained about that class. I guess didn't realize at the time how lucky I was.
4.)I miss Varsity Singers. I miss Mr. Boyer. I miss Bryonha. I miss Roy, Joe, Molly, Justine, Jill...all my MT friends
5.)I want to go to Jeremy's apartment right now. Enough said.
6.)I want to go to another Pomeroy concert. Where are my boys when I need them?
7.) I wanna be making a pizza and watching Star Wars with my brother Bryan at 2 in the morning. I miss those late night parties we used to have.
8.)I wish I was at Kairos right now. Haha...I think I'd cry this time.

Unfortunately, knowing that this will all be over in three weeks is no consolation for me right now. Three weeks has never seemed so long...Ahhh, an IM from Bryonha. Just what I need right now. I love my friends."

Someone needs to come over to my room and take my computer, my TV, my stereo and everything else that could possibly distract me. Maybe then I'll get some work done.
Went up to third floor bowman today. It honestly made me really sad. Do you guys ever miss living there? (Oh man, remember how clean it was?) It was weird, cause it kinda felt like going home or something. As I was walking down that hall, I had an overwhelming need to bang on gabby and sarah's door. I peeked into Mandy's room expecting to find her sitting on her bed staring at her laptop, but nope, just some new girl giving my really weird looks. Its weird seeing something move on without you...new year, new third floor.
Stresses in my life right now:
-Pledging (Delphi pre-pledge tonight, seriously, what happened?)

However, as expected, Kansas City was so much fun. Unfortunately, it was one of those trips that you kinda wish you'd never taken. One of those that went by too fast and makes you only miss the place so much more. Kinda like my New York trip...But anyways, here's a list of things that I learned during my short trip to KC:
-I love Pomeroy. I already knew this before, but this trip really proved it too me. Thanks, boys, for helping me forget things for a little while. I loved it.
-I always thought it was Kansas City that I miss so much while I'm here, but I was wrong. Its the people, not the city, that make my life back home so much fun
-No matter how many new sweatshirts I buy, nothing will ever feel like my old Sion sweatshirt. I will never get rid of this thing. Too many memories.
- I love going to church with my family. Going all alone here in Mt. Vernon is very, very lonely...
-Nothing makes me happier than music from my childhood. 
-There are songs out there that Gabby and I both like. Actually, there's a lot of them...
-I wish I could be more like my older brothers.
-Man do I miss the power of having ""fruitloops"" in my hand
-Its true what they say ""The hardest part of moving forward is learning not to look back""
Please dear God make these next five days go fast and be as painless as possible. I am dreading every minute. Now back to Jane Eyre..."

I have this horrible horrible feeling about my class, like its really going to kick me in the ass here in a few days. So far, its not been too bad, but its one of those courses where you feel like any second now she's going to pull out a pop quiz or assign some big ass paper that will end up being your doom. I don't really like having only afternoon class, it only annoys roommates and messes with your inner clock. And I really don't like the poetry we're studying right now cause its boring and difficult and i have no interest. And, unfortunately, because of Kansas City, I have to miss probably the most important class that we will be having this block. I love my life.
Sorry for the ramblings. Just a little frustrated. I'm hoping that I can go to Kansas City and forget for a second about class and NATS and chamber and Cornell. But I really don't see that happening..."

So, here I am, desperate to find something that will stop me from opening up that fucking Norton Anthology and reading a little Keats. This is where I find my livejournal comes in handy...
I'm beginning to think that I have no passion in life. I mean, I like a lot of things, but I have yet to have found something I am truly passionate about. I sat in English class today while we talked about the rhythm and rhyme scheme of a Blake poem, and I suddenly realized that I really didn't give a shit. In fact, I really don't give a shit about anything we're learning in this class. I don't want to read Jane Eyre or poems written by Emily Dickinson and D.H. Lawrence. Why? Cause I just don't give a shit. And I realized today that I am an English major, therefore, people like Emily Dickinson and D.H. Lawrence should probably excite me, or at least interest me. But nope...I am a bad English major. And as I sat there in class not giving a shit, it reminded me a lot of another class I had taken here at Cornell..a little class I like to call THEORY!!!! I remember all to well analyzing some stupid Beethoven Sonata and thinking ""Man, I really don't give a shit."" Hmmm...and I came here thinking that I liked music. Even French gets to me sometimes. (Just ask Lena, she knows all about my minor nervous breakdowns last block) I was under the impression that when you found something you truly loved, you truly loved it...Then seriously, why the hell am I having such problems?

Lets hope this one won't be as bad. Anne Lyman is annoying the living shit out of me. She has actually made choir not fun for me, which is so unbelievably hard to do. I have learned today that without my weekly schedule, I'm lost. How the hell did I manage to screw up so much stuff today? I have a voice lesson scheduled for when I'm supposed to be working, I'm working when I'm supposed to be at a piano lesson, I'm working when I'm supposed to be driving home on Friday...HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!? And I wish people would respond to emails quicker, cause i need to know stuff, like, now. Otherwise, as you can see, I go a little crazy. However, thank you God for Target.

I have just returned from what will probably end up being one of the best roadtrips of my college career. It was exactly what I needed right now...something to make me forget about Cornell and Iowa and friends and boys and music and, well, my life in general. I feel so much better now.
Thursday-hanging out in the car a lot. Which really wasn't too bad, because it gave me time to think and, more importantly, to sing. I forgot how much I miss that. Got to Chicago and to Ashley's apartment,which made me hate Cornell so much more. Why do I have to live in a fucking closet when others get to live in apartments for practically the same price? I hate karma. Ate a homemade italian dinner (with wine!!!.) Watched a program on PBS that reminded me of a part of me that I had forgotten about. (Don't worry if you didn't understand that last sentence, cause it made sense to me and thats all that matters.)
Friday- Found out we couldn't go to Teiter. Too bad. Went to Michigan Ave. Shopped. Ate. Watched a Christmas movie in October. That night, watched my new favorite movie, Mean Girls. (if you are rolling your eyes right now, you obviously haven't seen it) Yay for strawberry daquiris and finally feeling like an adult.
Saturday- Evanston. Bought a $50 skirt, my first splurge in two years. Noodles, talked about God and Kairos. Went to Forever 21, a store that was invented for me. Seriously, they should rename it ""Everything Jenni Wilson loves but really doesn't have enough money for because she wants to go to Europe"" Unfortunately, that would be a really long name for a store. Thai food and Sex in the City. 4 Rum and Cokes later, off to TMLMBGB. Called Vickie and Molly O'Neill. Walked home at 2 in the morning fearing for my life. Ate ""Chicken Rings"" at White Castle where some dude really liked my scarf. I was reminded that I have trouble with indian accents. Took the L for 30 seconds. Train Dance. Wow.
Sunday- McDonalds used to make really good cinnamon rolls. What happened to that? I want a beach here in Mt. Vernon. Something other than Ink Pond. Drove back. More singing. Returned to Cornell to realize that despite all my hope, nothing here has changed. Awesome.
Yay for catching up with old friends, yay for becoming closer to new ones, yay for remembering what its like to have inside jokes, yay for people finally meeting my high school friends and understanding why I am the way I am and why I miss it all so so much. Thank you, city of Chicago, for a truly wonderful, wonderful weekend."

I've decided that I do not like being drunk at Cornell. I can never get that drunk here again, and if I ever do, then I think I'm just gonna lock myself in my room until it passes. I'm serious. Being drunk at Cornell makes me really really nervous. We live in this little ""Cornell bubble"" where everybody knows everybody.

And then they'll tell somebody and then that person will tell someone else and...well, you get the point.

However, I am surprised at how much I have been missing my old friends recently. Has anyone else felt this way? I don't know if its just a sophomore year thing; maybe without the excitement of meeting new people that I had freshmen year, I've begun to realize how much I miss the company of old friends. Maybe its cause I know that some of them are not doing so well right now, maybe its learning that one of them had (kind of) died, or maybe its cause I miss having people around that truly know me. I really, really do miss that. I love how when I do things with my friends back home, it doesn't really require us to ""do"" anything. We simply get together and suddenly, doing absolutely nothing somehow becomes so much fun. We need to learn how to do that here...

I think that everyone around here needs to find a little bit more happiness in their lives. Maybe the drone of doing the same things every single day has gotten to everybody a bit. And that makes me sad...People (including me) need to stop taking things so seriously...

Going to Chicago in a week...then off to KC after that...two trips that I really need right now. Please, please get here quickly..."

Sophomore year sucks. I know we established this last year, but the past month has really further proved to me that, sometimes, I am right. I wish I could pinpoint what exactly makes this year so stupid, but I can't. Its more of an overall feeling, and overall aura of inevitable change. Drifting away from some, becoming closer to others. Letting go of one passion, adapting to another. Being so busy causes one to forget how to relax; it takes longer now for me to fall asleep, and when I do, I dream of class and choir and work and practicing. Even my dreams have schedules. I miss my family, my friends, my job, my life that I became so used to this summer. There is a part of me that ""clicks"" when I am at home; I have not yet found that here.

I hate goodbyes, I hate changes, therefore I absolutely hate this time of year. I just want to get to cornell and get all this shit over with, cause the anticipation of all this change is killing me.

I don't really know how to describe this week. I thought I was alright with going back to Cornell soon, I thought it was going to be easy. But then I made the mistake of looking at the calander. Actually seeing on paper that I only had two weeks left here at home was, well, overwhelming. And for the rest of this week, I've been in a sort of constant anxiety attack. So much to do, so many people to say goodbye to, so much stuff that i never got accomplished this summer, it was just too much. Don't get me wrong, guys, I love cornell, and there are certain things that i'm excited for, but i just don't feel ready quite yet to leave everything here at home. Sometimes I wish this summer wasn't as perfect as it was, cause it makes it that much harder to leave. i loved this summer, and thinking about going back to cornell, to classes, to phiffer, to mt. vernon; i'm sorry, it doesn't really excite me.

I hate goodbyes. I had to say goodbye to someone that I really, truly care about this week, and i never really knew how hard it can be to do that. Maybe cause i know that I probably won't see him for a really long time, and when we do, i know things will be different. I'm just really bad at moving on after any painful experience. Mostly, i think that i'm really bad at dealing with emotions. I'm much better when it comes to other's feelings, but my own, well, i struggle. Maybe thats what makes things like this so hard.

however, on a happier note, i have a feeling that all these weird emotions will go away within seconds when i get back to school, so you guys don't have to worry. I can't wait to see you guys and all the things i love about cornell. Only one more update, and then i'll be back!! Hope you're all excited..."

Okay, i went to the Evenescence concert, which was funny and eye-opening. It took me about four seconds at the concert to feel really, really stupid. I wish that I hadn't worn my most preppiest outfit to a concert filled with goths and hard rockers. It was funny, the opening bands were, well, screaming into the mike and calling it music. Why, then, did I like them so much? I'm serious, that concert brought out something in me that loves hard rock. I loved every minute. 

Got back from Colorado today. Winter Park is beautiful. We had a family reunion, which was surprisingly more fun than expected. Went whitewater rafting, and I wish you all could have been there. It was pretty damn funny. Another Lewis and Clark moment...

Watched the movie Blow with Johnny Depp. (That last comment will probably only interest Gabby, but I figured I throw it in anyway) Tuesday night, went over to my friend Lauren's house. Watched Taxi Driver. Wednesday night, went to a Pomeroy concert at Lucky's Brewgrille. As always, it was awesome, filled with two of my favorite things in this world: Dave and Long Island iced teas. Thursday was my brother Adam's birthday, the big 24. We went out to eat on the Plaza and hung out afterwards, eating cake and watching TV. Good times. Friday, went to a Royals game. The Royals are Kansas City's major league baseball team, in case you didn't know. We suck. Seriously. And I decided my new favorite thing to do at boring sports games is to try to be the most obnoxious person in the crowd. So, I had fun cheering really loud and clapping way too much. The person next to me was shocked when she found out that I was 19 years old. ""I thought you were, like, 15."" Thats when I knew that my work there was done...

Tonight I tried to watch Gothica with my friend Vickie, but that didn't work out. I didn't realize when I rented the movie that it was about scary crazy people. And we all know Jenni can't take that...

I went to New York this weekend. Question: Could you all see me living in New York someday? (Is this part of my future, kind of like Eliot Thayer?) How do we feel about this? Cause I definately fell in love with that city. Best weekend of my life.

""I love the 90s""- frickin awesome. Watched every episode like 3 times. My life is sad, but I don't really care.

I decided that I'm going to grad school, either at NYU or Boston University. I realized the other day exactly what has been bothering me since i got to cornell. All of last year,I had a hard time getting motivated to do anything, whether it be to get good grades, get involved in more shit, etc. Well, the problem was, I had no goal. I'm the type of person who needs a goal of some sort, something to look forward to, or else i get bored. Now my motivation is grad school, and I'm happy about that.
Now I just need to get back to school cause I'm getting antsy here at home.

Anyways, hope all is well with the rest of you. Hope jobs are going good, hope you all are finding something to do.(especially you Gabby...)Talk to you all soon!!"

"event","I really and truly have nothing to talk about this week. Summer is starting to get real old real fast. Sick of work, sick of home, sick of friends, sick of life and doing the exact same thing everyday. Can't wait to get back to school.

I had an awesome time at Cornell. I don't really know why, its not like I did anything really exciting while I was there, but I still had a great time. I think it was just really nice to get away for awhile.

Since you guys evidently live vicariously through me and the happenings of my life, I suppose I'll go through what I did this past week since I last saw you. Um, I worked a lot, of course. Worked this incredably long tournament today. (6 hours for 18 holes!)Today was the hottest day so far this summer, and lets just say that makes my job not fun anymore. Lets see, Thursday, did nothing. Friday, worked a midnight golf thing that once again lasted forever. Got to be a bartender though, which was fun. Saturday, my friends came over cause they were bored and we decided to make dinner. This so called ""dinner"" ended up becoming a feast of stuff like chicken and salad and thai pizza. I got to make margaritas, and they were damn good I might add. We ate out on my patio and made the table look all pretty.  It was fun. It was so ""summer"".
Going to New York this Friday and I could not be more excited. Gonna spend a lot of money and regret it next year when its time to pay for Europe, but oh well. Think I'll go to bed now, cause I gotta wake up early tomorrow and work. Just keep reminding myself New York New York New York..."

"event","At this time tomorrow, I will be at Cornell. I will be back in boring ol' Iowa staying in a non air-conditioned room in Pauley-Rorem. I am so excited I could just scream...

Who'd of thought I would miss Cornell so much that I would drive 5 and a half hours just to stay there for one day? I definately did not. But, the second I realized that I was going to have two days off from work this week, visiting Cornell immediately popped into my head. My parents don't want me to go. They think it is a waste of time and gas. They just don't get it. I have to get back to Cornell, even if it is only for 24 hours. I've noticed that I have become two completely different and separate people. There's the Cornell me and then there's the ""at home"" me. When I was at Cornell, I missed being the ""at home"" me. Now that I'm at home,  I miss being the Cornell me. Thats why it will be so nice to get back to Cornell and Theta Phi Beta and Swiss Chocolate Milks and everything that makes my new college life so much fun. I can't wait. 

I know that by the second week of next semester I am going to read this entry and think "" Why the hell did I miss Cornell so much?"" but I don't care. I miss it now and thats all that matters. See you tomorrow everybody!!!"

"event","I'm tired but I don't want to sleep. So here I am, dozing off while watching ""25th Hour"", refusing to give in and go to bed. For some reason, I now find defeat in going to bed before midnight. I'm writing in my live journal as a desperate attempt to remain awake, so forgive me if this entry seems a bit scattered.

I went to lunch with an old friend from high school the other day. Its amazing how much you can change in the first year of college and not even realize it. I sat across from this girl and all I could think about was how we had nothing in common anymore. I probably should have expected that, but to be honest, it was kind of a frightning realization.

I'm ready to get back to Cornell. This summer has been wonderful, a nice long break, but its time to get back. I'm so ready for sophomore year. Sure, it'll probably suck (sophomore year always does) but I'm ready. Bring it on. Bring on those interesting yet challenging courses I've got lined up for next year. Bring on living in Phiffer. I can take it...

Remember how we used to talk about how we were all gonna come back to Cornell changed this year? Well, we weren't kidding. I think we're all going to probably be really different. I didn't realize how big of a summer this is; for some reason, I feel like been growing up. And thats weird for me...Mandy, you might not be the only one coming back all mature this fall.

I think I found my calling this weekend. I got to try my hand at bartending, and fell in love with it. So, after college, I'm gonna move to LA with my friend Molly and become a bartender. You all should give me your thoughts on this idea... 

Also, everyone at work has started to call me Jen, and I think I like it. Maybe I'll start going by Jen. Again, thoughts...

Well, thats all I got for this week. (Please, someone get me back to school so I can have a life again...)"

"event","Writing in my live journal is making me realize how monotonous my life is...each week I honestly feel that I have nothing new to write.

My life has become the same thing over and over and over again. Wake up. Go to work. Work for 8 hours. Come home. Eat. Work out. Hang out with friends. Sleep. There we go, I just led you guys through another day of my awesome, exciting life. Sound fun?

Unfortunately, I'm beginning to start feeling comfortable back at home again. Its nice having home cooked food, a nice big room (with no roommate), and my own car that gives me the ability to go where ever I want. But now when I think about going back to Cornell in the fall, its like, hmmm...do I really want to? Anybody else feel the same way?

However, there are certain things I definately do miss about my days at Cornell.
For example:

-I miss our table in Sodexho. While I miss all our intellectual conversations,its the non-intellectual, stupid conversations that I miss the most.
-I miss our nightly TV schedule in Gabby and Sarah's room. Every night it was The Family Guy, then the very end of Dharma and Greg (I HATE that show), and then Friends. I've tried watching these shows here in KC, and it just isn't the same. Now when I yell ""I love Jennifer Aniston"" my family just tells me to shut up.
-I miss going to the Java House, getting my swiss chocolate milk for $2.05, and analyzing how our lives are going to end up. By the way, still keeping my eye out for Eliot Thayer.
-I miss choir. (However, I DO NOT miss, nor will I ever, ever, ever miss DR. HEARNE)
-It surprising how much I miss the random people I used to see at cornell. Boys like Jim Thompson, John Wagener, Justin Ghodes, and the love of my jazz ensemble; random girls like Jess LaSusa and ""I'm giving up the facade"" Claire. I never realized how nice it was to see these peoples faces everyday. Even though I barely know them, seeing them was always kind of comforting. 

Oh, and I have some news. I look down at my hand last week and realized that my ""wedding ring"" was, for some reason, irritating my finger. I took this as a sign. I guess I'm not supposed to get married so soon after all. So, I have removed the wedding ring once and for all. I don't need to get married, at least not yet. AND, I've also realized that I don't want to marry for money, or even be rich when I'm older. Working with them this summer has made me realize that I would much rather be a well-rounded, decent person than a snobby spoiled bitch.

So thats my week. Lots of thinking. Nothing too exciting. Sorry. I'll think up a fun story for next time."

"event","Hi guys!! Another week in the life of Jenni Wilson...luckily, this time I have stuff to talk about.

Work is so unbelievably wonderful. I love that I get paid 10 bucks an hour for driving around in a golf cart. Got a ten dollar tip the other day, just for ""being cute"". Awesome. Keep that up. I'm working a ton: 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. Got my first paycheck though, and that made everything worth it. I'm so happy right now. 

Went to my old hometown this weekend to see Pomeroy with my friends. Yay for roadtrips. It was soooo awesome. Got pretty damn shitfaced. Just to let you know, Smirnoff Twisted Green Apple is absolutely amazing, and I recommend it to all. Oh, and note to self- Never, ever offer to be the designated driver, cause it sucks driving drunk people around all night being completely sober. Never doing that again. Saw Dave. He's definetely still hot as ever. I was completely and totally drunk when we talked, though, and it was damn funny. I definately told him that I have the biggest crush on him and that he should plan on getting married to me, cause its bound to happen. He just laughed. He thought I was kidding...

Mandy, I took my mom to Culvers today. She was impressed. Got some cheese curds. They were good, but i still can't take the name. ""Curds""=not cool

I'm so tired right now, but I have to stay up to wait for my laundry to finish. I really should have started it earlier. I have work tomorrow at 10, so i should get to bed. Hmmm...fuck laundry. Night everyone!!!!"

"event","Hmmm...so another week of my summer has gone by and I honestly feel like I've accomplished nothing during it. I'm trying to find something to write about, something exciting that has happened in my life to keep you all entertained, but I'm coming up with nothing. Sorry about that, guys.

So basically, I've been working. A LOT. I pulled in a good 45 hours last week, which is both good and bad. Bad cause work has become my life, Good because I am making lots and lots of money to be spent on cute clothes and trip to Italy. I made the amazing discovery this past week that if you flirt with the rich country clubbers, they will tip you. Nicely. This isn't too hard to do, considering the people I work for are all young, handsome, rich doctors. So, I guess I can't really complain about the job much, cause its not too bad. I've realized that no matter how easy or awesome a job is, I will always hate it. Which doesn't really make me look forward to the rest of my life. Looks like I'm going to have to cherish these college years, cause real life sucks.

Watched a cool show on the ol' History Channel today about Jesse James. Turns out the man probably faked his death and lived to be, like, 84 without anyone really knowing it. Thats cool. Props to Jesse James...

I achieved one of my summer goals tonight- I tried Tilapia. Thats right, Mandy, and I thought of you the whole time. Awesome fish. Wouldn't really want to do a report on it, but it was still good.

Good news- my brother dumped his girlfriend. Saw that one coming...

Its been almost a good two weeks since Cornell, and I have yet to talk to Mandy or Sarah or Lena. I don't really know what to do. I really have no computer here at home that is easy to get onto, and that really sucks. So I can only get on aim every once in awhile. I don't like this. Where's Theta Phi Beta when I need them?!?"

"event","Wow...so i'm updating. Mandy said that I wouldn't and I am determined to prove her wrong. By the way, Mandy, just to let you know, I have been watching the history channel. So far, I've learned about the imbommidable snowman and something about vikings(I was kinda sleeping through that last one) You will be amazed next fall when I come back all smart...

I have been home for almost a week and its been one of the longest of my life. I still keep thinking that I'm going to leave soon, I feel like this is just another spring break and soon I will be back in bowman trying some wicked spicy hot sauce and hearing crazy stories of semis and nebraskan hobos. But I'm not, and that makes me sad.

It wasn't until I got home that I really realized how much I've changed this year. Sometimes I feel like my old friends don't even know me anymore, especially when they ask questions like, ""Jenni, your favorite color is pink?"" 

I started my new job. It's okay, I guess. Right now, I'm the ""beer girl"" on the golf course. Basically I spend my days driving around on a golf cart, handing out beer to rich doctors. God, I love my life...

I've had some weird and awkward experiences at work, though. The worst happened while I was being trained. I was riding around in the golf course, listening April tried to explain the game of golf to me (by the way, golf is definitely being put on the list of things I will never be able to understand). Suddenly, we took a sharp turn and, well, I definitly flew out of the cart and rolled out onto the green. Awesome.

Then when it was time for a smoke break, I made the mistake of telling everyone that I was a smoker. They thought I meant a pack a day, addicted to nicotine smoker. They handed my a cigarette and well, naturally, expected me to be able to light my own. Didn't go so well for me. I felt REAL stupid.

So, thats my week so far. Its been a weird one. At times, I wish I was back at Cornell knitting in Gabby's and Sarah's room. Too bad. Plus, I could really use a good swiss chocolate milk right now..."

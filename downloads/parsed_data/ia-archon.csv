"event","Meh, I feel bad. So I decided to get it off my chest here although no one will read it. First of all I guess I will start off with Ashlee (what else is new). Everytime we talk, I do something really stupid that upsets her. I say the most retarded crap and no matter even if I know I am right or wrong, I just keep going until she hates me. Now I know she hates me. When we were at a party last night, she just....made me feel crappy. But I deserved it. I want to tell her I am really sorry, but she wouldn't care even if I did. =( SORRY ASH!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anywayz, besides that, I mentioned up there that we went to a party. The party was a going away party for one of our friends named Erin. And wow, I am really going to miss her, I really wish that I would have gotten to know her better now that it is too late. She is an awesome person. She never gets mad, and she is just an awesome person to be around, she can put a smile on anyones face. One of the most things I regret is that when I left the party and we hugged, I didn't get to say a proper goodbye. Beacuse there were things I wanted to tell her that wasn't for everyone elses ears you know? Yeah, but I will miss her alot. Have fun Erin, have a safe trip, And please keep in touch. <3

I am also having alot of mixed feelings right now. Mandy is......she...is mis-leading I guess to say. Everytime I get over her, we wind up spending some time together and I start liking her again. Well, we spent alot of time at the party together and flirted. But another problem is she flirts with like everyone. I told Mandy that I am starting to like her again, and I asked her if she liked me, and she said yes. (yay? =/) But the whole her flirting with like everyone also is a problem. And she has a b/f, beacuse she...gah, I am not sure I want to get into that right now. Basically to sum it up. Mandy broke up with Will, Will asked Angela out, they went out, Will called Mandy, Will broke up with Angela and Mandy and Will went back out. So we will see.

Hrmm, what else, I feel really depressed right now..............Ionno why.... Probably beacuse Erin is leaving.

I got a summer volunteer job at the Rec Center. (fun fun) I am doing it for 2 reasons, 1. Volunteering always looks good when applying for a job. 2.I don't want to have a summer like I did last summer.

I'm done updating. And a final closer. I am really sorry Ashlee, I want you to know that. =("

"event","I guess I shall update again, something to when your bored. ^_^ Well, things are alright now with a few things. Me and Ashlee sorted out are stuff, and we are doing good again, I just hope it stays that way. <3 Ashlee.

On the down side, I was drinking a Dr. Pepper today, and I accidently knocked it over, and all of it spilled on my BRAND NEW keyboard. It is expensive to, it's made for lazy people who can't double click and application, instead I push a button. =) But now I got this really crappy ghetto keyboard. I am sad. </3

I didn't do my Dr. Ed. HW either, and now thinking about that, I got called to the Office today beacuse of some shit that happened to me awhile back. It was right before report cards. And I had an asmtha clinic thing, and I came into 3rd hour (Dr. Ed.) like 3 min late. And I asked if I could turn in the HW, and he said no since I was late, and he wouldn't give me any of the days Work either. So I got a nice 3 0's right before the graded were getting turned in for report cards. So yeah, I dropped a letter grade and a half, and after talking with the Counsler and Princapal about it, we lost. =(

Well, not much more I can say...I still want to grow my hair out! I really think I am going to!

Laters!!!

WooT!!!!

"event","I really don't know what I am going to do about much of anything. Things are just sorta falling apart. And no, it's not just Ashlee, although that is a big part of it. First of all, I was so excited about Spring Break to start last week, that there was this HUGE paper that was due the Monday that we got back from Spring Break for Dr. Ed. And I accidentally put it in my locker...and the paper has to be signed by an adult..So basically I have to go to school extra early tommorrow, make both of my brother miserable for going early, then grab the paper and come home and make my Grandma sign every page. Nice way to start the end of Spring Break eh? 

Also, I noticed my grades have been slipping alot this semeseter....I am an A/B student...and I have B/C's? I mean what the crap? I really need to start paying attention more or something before I fail or something. =(

Now another problem, there is a concert Tuesday (2 days from now). It's a Slipknot concert. I want to go really bad, but it's on a school night...so my Grandma doesn't want me to go. I am still debating it with her...I really hope I can, it's like a once in a life time thing. And the Concert isn't even during freaking school, she is just stupid. =/ And I don't even have to pay for anything. <3 Mandy's mom, for some reason she buys me tickets to everything.=/

Now Ashlee. Things looked like they....might be..ok..for a little while atleast. I really want to talk to her, just me and her. But she is....seems to be in a blah state right now. And after reading her last journal entry..I am not really sure she would even care to see me....I just don't know what to do. I will just.....be the best I can be, be there for her if she wants me to be. But that's basically all I can do. And everytime I talk to her on MSN, I seem to be the only one talking, so...we will just see how it goes. ^_^ <3 Ashlee x10 =)

Now, one last after thought. I really think...I am going to change my style a bit.. I know it sounds crazy, but for some reason I think I am going to get a bowl cut, but like spike the bowl cut down. And maybe some new clothes....I just feel like I need a change... I don't know. I will see. =) The clothes I am not sure, maybe some cacky-ish shorts. I don't know, still in theory. And to grow out my hair that long will take...atleast 6 months. So it's just all..in my mind. ^_^

Oh well, laters."

"event","Wow, this is like the first time I have ever made an entry on LJ. I didn't think I was ever going to. I was just going to wait until I got a cool sexy background and such. But hell, I am extremely bored, so I need something to do. =)

Let's see....today....I woke up about 9:00...Ryan called and told me he was getting his hair cut...so he asked me to go and I did go..he looks alot different now, he used to have long hair, but now he has short-ish looking hair. Oh well, I am sure I will get used to it after some time. Then after that he was really paranoid what others might say about his hair, he cares just a little bit to much what other people think. =/ Especially this one girl named Vanessa..he has him whipped and chained. =/

After that we went to his house...and...ate some lunch...and then were bored for awhile, Kaitlin stopped by to take a look at his hair...she thought it was terrible. ;) We played his PS2 for awhile as well....then Ashlee called...then Ryan called his Dad to come take him to his house, and take him to mine...and so about 30min later I went home...and I just sorta played DiabloII all day...I am such a nerd. ^_^

I feel really...blah right now for some reason, I really don't know why...I don't really think I can put it into text...I really miss Ashlee for some reason though...although I just saw her like..2 days ago. I know that I care about her ALOT...not sure if she feels the same way...I know she likes me..just probably not as much as I like her or so...She won't even read this I doubt...so it is cool. ;)

All I can think of putting...if I ever get bored enough again, I might update. Laters. :D <3 Ashlee. :P"

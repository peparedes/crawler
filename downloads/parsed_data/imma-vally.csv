You are very hyper. You never slow down, even when it's killing you.
You're the type of person who can be a workaholic during the day... and still have the energy to party all night.
Your energy is definitely a magnet for those around you. People are addicted to your vibe.

You are usually the best at everything ... you strive for perfection. 
You are confident, authoritative, and aggressive. 
You have the classic ""Type A"" personality.

You are relaxed, chill, and very likely to go with the flow.
You are light hearted and accepting. You don't get worked up easily.
Well adjusted and incredibly happy, many people wonder what your secret to life is.

You are friendly, charming, and warm. You get along with almost everyone.
You work hard not to rock the boat. Your easy going attitude brings people together.
At times, you can be a little flaky and irresponsible. But for the important things, you pull it together.

You are wild, crazy, and a huge rebel. You're always up to something.
You have a ton of energy, and most people can't handle you. You're very intense.
You definitely are a handful, and you're likely to get in trouble. But your kind of trouble is a lot of fun.

You tend to be pretty tightly wound. It's easy to get you excited... which can be a good or bad thing.
You have a lot of enthusiasm, but it fades rather quickly. You don't stick with any one thing for very long.
You have the drive to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. Your biggest problem is making sure you finish the projects you start.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsyournameshiddenmeaningquiz/"">What's Your Name's Hidden Meaning?</a></div>"

"event","well i have an update and boy is it a crazy one. 

well i got a call from greg tonight. he has been calling me every other day since he broke up with me. every conversation was almost the same. he would ask if any guys have come out of the ""woodwork"", basically asking if im talking to anyone. well of course i havent, since we just broke up last week. well today he calls, and i decide to call him back. he starts off the convo the same way, and i was like, ""no. im not talking to anyone. why do you have someone else?"" reminder it has only been a week, and we were together for 2+ years. well he comes out and says he is dating someone else. he told me last tuesday (the day after we broke up), that someone messaged him b/c they heard he was single. well he wouldnt tell me who then, but he made it clear he was NOT interested. well, tonight he tells me that they are dating. guess who it is? none other than someone i considered to be a good friend of mine. i had been telling jj, patrick, and loryn that this girl hadnt even commented to me about my break up with greg. she had made excuses about being emo. when really her ass was going behind my back to get with greg. i think its really funny that said girl has herpes. i also find it really funny that greg brought up doing a 3some with her numerous times during our relationship. it makes me think back to mine and loryns bday thing, since greg and said girl were all buddy buddy all night. i find it really fucking strange that they are all official not even a week after we broke up. they both have said that nothing happend before, but i have a really hard time believing that. in the past, jj made comments about her being all ""single white female"" towards me, and how she was going to try and steal greg. 

i think the whole thing is a total bitch move on both of their parts. dont go behind my back and formulate a fucking plan. they both knew what they were doing, and i can honestly say that i hate them both. i dont want greg, and i defintely dont need some desperate stalker bitch as a friend. greg said he didnt want any drama caused by our breakup and i really think i handled the whole thing in a very mature manner. i accepted it, and  i understood that maybe things just werent working. greg always told me that he wouldnt start dating anyone for a while, b/c he needed time to get over me. bullshit! at this moment, i dont think he gave 2 shits about me or my feelings. i find it really funny that he has continued to tell me that he loves me, but he is already with someone knew. im absolutely appauld that he would make it one of my so called ""friends"". i realize now that she wasnt a friend. on my birthday, she smiled in my face, while she flirted with my boyfriend. both of them deny anything happening before we broke up, but wtf is flirting with my then boyfriend? 

i dont need either one of them in my life, and honestly, i wish i never would have met greg. i really thought that we would be able to maintain a friendship, but i realize that he was just smiling in my face and going behind my back. i hope they are happy, b/c obviously they are ment for each other. i am sure she will end up his rebound, since thats how she always is. i should have fucking known since she has done this in the past. unfortunately, i am a trusting individual, and i actually thought we were friends. boy was i wrong. 

incase you are wondering who gregs lucky new girl is: its mariel (aka bassjunkie)"

update: 

greg and i broke up. it had been coming for a while, but i guess i didnt think it would be yesterday. i am hurt, and sad by the situation. i love him with all my heart, but i guess we are just not supposed to be together. our lives are going in completely different directions. i hope that we will be able to be/stay close, and i dont regret anything about our relationship what so ever. i met him when i needed someone to motivate me, and help me find my way. he has done so much for me. he helped me get my life back together after going through hell and back. i am very thankful for the time we spent together."

"event","well. where do i begin? i havent commented or posted lately, b/c i had an issue with my computer and its still out of commission. greg reformatted it, and we cant get the sound card to work or the ethernet card. sucks. i havent had much time to mess with it or look into the issue. i have my sidekick, so im not completely w/o, but the sk can be annoying. 

new stuff with me: 

i made the dean's list at school. i never imagined that i would ever be on the dean's list. i showed my parents the letter, and they hung it on the fridge. im sure they were just as shocked as i was. a lot has changed since high school- thats for sure. 

i have found something to calm my nonexistent attention span. sudoku. i tried to do the puzzle in the paper this morning, and man that is hard! i worked on it for 3 hours straight. i didnt realize the first hour that i was doing it wrong. (heh) i have never concentrated on anything for so long in my life. i have no focus, and i realize that, so what is it with sudoku. i almost consider them addictive. 

i ended up transffering out of my anp2 class. i have decided to take the accelerated 8week class with the teacher i had last semester. the teacher i got for anp2 is terrible, and i felt like he was wasting my time and money. i am not paying him, so that i can teach myself anatomy. i am paying him to teach me. he was an idiot anyways. i would much rather work twice as hard for less the time with the teacher i really liked. my chemistry class is going surprisingly well. i was worried since i suck at science, but i think anp1 gave me a little boost to help me with this. anp 1 had a chapter on chem and bio-chem, so i was a little refreshed coming into this. so far, so good with chem. i am glad, since i was really worried going into the semester. 

greg is fabulous. he just had a birthday, so i made him a german chocolate cake. he loved the cake. boyfriend. *swoon*"

right to her. my mom and i were both a little nervous about that. he
would growl at us sometimes when we would hold him. which was probably
due to the pain. im trying to tell myself that this is better. its just
so weird not having him sleeping under my desk. everytime i write in my
livejournal he is always under my feet. its going to be weird not
having him. chief is already noticing. he keeps walking around looking
where skipper would normallly be. my mom took him out when they got
back from taking skipper and she said he was just looking around
outside. like skipper should be out there with him. i am curious how my
brother will take it. i was awake when my parents left so i got to say
goodbye. well as good as you can in the situation. tim wasnt here
though. he knew it was coming, but im sure he would have liked to say
goodbye. my mom said when she was paying she almost yelled stop. my mom
had a really hard time with this. my dad seems to be taking it pretty
well. this is weird since skipper was my first dog ever. his bday is
feb 18th. and he would have been 14. (technically he is 14, b/c we got
him when he was about 8weeks old, but we celebrate his bday the day we
got him) i miss him so much already. <br>

bad influence. i like passing out with him. i'm really glad he came
over. i almost told him not to b/c i was sick. he said he would take
care of me. (awww) i think i ended up getting him sick. he wasnt
feeling so hot when he left. it could have been due to his lack of
sleep. now he has to go teach all day. i have decided we dont have pg
nights. :) we watched monster. it was okay. i wasnt paying complete
attention. it seemed ok though. we returned his 2 xbox games. this
saturday we are going to go shopping and he can get something else. he
is also looking for gift idea's for things i would like for my

a saturday this year. i will be spending it with greg and i believe we
will have a night on the town &lt;3<br>

end with a&nbsp; hot make out session, of course. &lt;3 we talked on
the phone for almost 3 hours. he is so nice. he offered to come over

hair done (it took 5 hours! that is way too long... my ass was asleep
in the chair) i finally got out of there at 430pm. i went home and not
even an hour after i got home my boss called. she needed me to work
midnights. i agreed but afterwards it hit me that i had originally
agreed to work last night for someone else. after i got the hours my
boss took them away and gave them to a prn. she said she has to offer
them the hours first. (shady) so saturday gets here and i work anyways

i just had a lovely distraction from my livejournal. greg &lt;3 it

<br>
last week (monday or tuesday) i pissed greg off. it was to the point he
didnt even want to speak to me. he had every right to be mad and after
thinking about it.. i was making a stupid&nbsp; decision. we ended up
hanging out saturday as planned and everything was great. everything is
always awesome when you put us together. sunday we went to this gyro
place. i had my very first gyro. yum! i told greg he is making me
worldly. haha. first a philly cheese steak and now a gyro. one of these
days he is going to have me eating seaweed. (eh. i dont think so) the
whole situation with us i'm just going with it. i want to see what
happens. you never know but i am not going to get my hopes up.<br>
<br>
work is work. i'm excited about my 3 weeks off. i would be content just
staying home. i will be going to tennessee. my old best friend john (the one i moved to tennesee with) was talking to me on aim last night while i was
at work. for a second i thought he was going to ask me to meet him for
lunch while i am in tennessee. its really weird with me and him. i
really miss him as a friend. we were so close. even all the shit that
happend i cant be mean to him. it would seem much easier to tell him to
fuck off and never speak to me again, but i cant. whenever i look at my
old photo album from parties in chicago ( before i move) i always see
all the pics of me and him. i never imagined we wouldnt be friends. i
think we just ended up in a bad situation. john was always honest no
matter what. i miss that. it was really nice to have a friendship where
you never wonder if the person has some other intention. with him being
as gay as gay can be.. there was never even a thought of ""what if"" or
feelings starting.<br>
<br>
my trip to tennessee! i havent talked to dan since before new years. i
should call him sometime this week. i know i still have 4 weeks until i
go. i just want to make sure we have everything figured out and that
nothing happend. plus we usually at least say hi.. we are friends and
what not.<br>

i just started a new book last night at work. its called 10 stupid
things women do to mess up their lives. its by dr. laura schlessinger.
so far so good.&nbsp; i have only read the first chapter. <br>
<br>
</font><font size=""2""><b>skipper (maybe i should have made him his own entry)</b><br>
well it looks like this week is it. i should be happy since he has made
it this year. he is 14 years old. thats pretty old. he is almost
completely blind (cataracts)</font>, <font size=""2"">he is dropping
weight fast. he is a small dog anyways but you can see him hip bones,
his hair is falling out. he is just falling apart. we believe he has
cancer. my mom says he has that cancer smell. i guess people get it and
dogs do as well. he is the first dog i ever had. it will just be weird
to not have him. i guess my dad is going to take him one day this week
(most likely saturday) i dont think i want to know when he takes him.
well i do, but im sure i will freak. i can just imagine how skipper is
going to act. thinking about it sucks. everytime i get all teary. <br>

and we did our own thing. everytime i see him i am in such a great
mood. kissing him at midnight was just one of the many incredible parts
of my nye/new years morning. i asked his opinion on my money situation.
i know he thinks i am completely irresponsible with money. (maybe i am
just a little.) he offered to help, but told me that i would have to
take his suggestions. the one plus i have is that i always save
reciepts when i use credit and debt cards. i am going to think about
his suggestions and really work on it. he said NO more shopping. which
is part of my new years resolution anyways.. since i do shop too much. <br>

my new years resolutions this year are:<br>
1. stop online shopping. i spend too much money buying clothes i see
online. i do shop clearance but i dont always like what i get and im
stuck with them. <br>
2. quit all unhealthy relationships. <br>
3. sign up for school <br>
4. start using my membership to wwo. i pay 29$ a month and i never go.
i think i went 4 times this past year. i also want to continue drinking
at least 6 servings of water per day. also continue to eat healthy. <br>
5. pay off and cancel one of my credit cards.. and pay off the other one. <br>
6. set up a savings account.<br>
<br>
so there it is. all the things i plan to do this year. i know i can do
all of those things. it might take a little work but i can do them.
actually i need to do them.. and there is no better time to start than
now. i also plan to exercise on my lunch break at work. they have some
excersice equipment at the shelter and what else do i have to do all
night? i might spend a full hour exercising on slow days. its better
than sitting on my butt reading magazines.. i can do that the other 5
boring hours of the night. hehe. <br>"

"event","<font color=""#ccccff""><font size=""2"">so my boss called me at 930am. i
didnt know she called until about 1130am. i tried to call her but she
must have been busy. so finally she calls me back around 2. i was
really curious why she called me at home. it sounded pretty important.
well she called b/c she needed me to go over an altercation between a
staff member and a client the other night. i guess she had to talk to
everyone about the incident and since the lady told me about stuff they
had to ask me. it kind of sucks. you never want to admit that your
co-worker was wrong. it just makes a weird work situation. <br>
<br>
i work tonight and then i need to come home and get to sleep. i am
hanging out with greg tomorrow night. &lt;3 its going to be awesome
like always. we are just going to do our own thing which is hot. i was
hoping my new clothes would be here before friday i hope they come
tomorrow. i want to wear the camo pants &lt;3 they are hot! greg and i
talked on the phone like 3 times yesterday for long periods. plus we
were talking online quite a bit too. it was really great. i should have
had him over last night.. but i was feeling really bad still. im glad
he called to cheer me up. he is so sweet. im going to quit being all
&lt;3 whatever.<br>
<br>
i am finally getting over being sick. i was only sick for 2 days but
man it was a long two days. greg was sick a couple days before me so i
am blaming him for making me sick. ^_^ it might not have been him since
everyone has been sick lately... but o well. <br>
<br>
everyone have a safe and happy nye! <br>

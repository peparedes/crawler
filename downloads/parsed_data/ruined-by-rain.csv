           Life's about growing up, learning from your mistakes, and changing for the better, but somewhere along the lines we all mess up. We change to be like everyone else, we take one person's mistakes and make it everyones, we take our mistakes and blame it on others. 
           Life is about making friends, meeting people you don't want to be like, learn from them and learn how to not be like them. Life is about realizing that people do change and that not many people will be around in 15 years but still realizing you need them because us as human beings are dependent on people. We depend on what people think and the approveale of others. 
           Life is about messing up and get back on track. Life is about not letting something ruin you but making it help you get better, make you a better person. 
           Life is about realizing your mistakes. Life is about forgiving but at the same time its okay to hold grudges, being stubborn and standing behind what you believe in."

Some random highlights... skanking on the mainstage cause there was like no one there.. Mrs. Foy moshing with the kids, Scott going for an amazing dive in the crowd and of course falling, Mrs. Foy saying "" I was gonna crowd surf but I didn't wanna see like a fag"" , Grandma Foy bobbing her head to the music and attempting to dance, Tom swinging me and um yes I fucked up my arm but it was fun. Ah such a good time even if almost all but 5 bands sucked. </P>

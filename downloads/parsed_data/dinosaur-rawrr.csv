last night was pretty fun. went and hung out with Jason and Sammy all day, then we went up into the middle of nowhere in the mountains and camped out in Sammy's RV with some people and drank beer. lol. and today were probably doing the same thing, but more prepared because...we didnt bring any food or barely any blankets and it was below freezing...it sucked pretty much. 

but besides all that..my mommys been letting me drive alot..its cool, i just hope i dont get pulled over sometime, especially on the interstate. that would suck.

i miss home. 
and i miss Andre, a whole lot.
and i miss Lauren..
and all my friends.

but hopefully i'll be home soon."

AND to top it all off...since im such a fucked up person, i lost my FAVORITE sweater today in the ATL ofcourse.

"event","Well, this is my first entry in this thing. i never end up keeping these very long because i always forget to write in them and then it just gets annoying. but maybe i'll actually keep it this time!

so. whats been going on in my life...well everyday is pretty much party time for me, or atleast the hanging out part not so much the party part lol. I have this AMAZING boy in my life now, Andre Ristorcelli, finally. we've been friends for a really long time and have always had a thing for eachother but it just never got out, and now it did and i couldnt be happier.

I've been spending alot more time with my BFF Lauren, which is good. i lost her for a while and it sucked but now were better friends than we ever have been! 

Yes i dropped out of highschool and im getting my GED, ive already taken the testing and now im just waiting for the results.i dont care what anyone thinks about that because i know im not a drop out and the only reason i did it is because i really and truley hate school. and im going to cosmetology school, one of the top ones in america.

so pretty much life is pretty wonderful right now. i have nothing to complain about.

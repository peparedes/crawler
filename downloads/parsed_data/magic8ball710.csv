"event","there are times when i think that, despite the fact that my work is so far off from my career path of choice, i couldnt have been at a more appropriate place. an accounting major might find some solace in a design firm(managing their finances) but an industrial design major sticks out like a sore thumb surrounded by corporate bean counters. take for example, on friday when i was making box labels. our unit is moving up to the third floor on thursday, so we have to pack, and pack up quick: at least 2 of my coworkers will be gone different days of the week, so we cant devote a day just to pack our stuff. several of our files were boxed and upon boxing them i was instructed to make labels for them. since the labels are printed on regular typewriting paper, i have to cut them to size so i can slap them onto the sides of the boxes. naturally, i had to use a pencil, ruler, tape, and scissors to perform the said procedure, which came to me naturally, because thats what one would use if they were to cut and paste something into anything. i heard art, the assistant director (of pretty much the entire building) come into our offices talking to my manager. he was there to have a chat with my coworker terry, who is unfortunately the problem child of our unit, but instead of storming into her cubicle he approached me instead. he observed me for a good 30 seconds then told my manager, ""people still use rulers and scissors?"" he said this jokingly and i saw in his face a look of curiosity and confusion; he was fascinated at the fact that i was doing something as quaint as cutting and pasting <i>physical</i> objects, not something virtual on my computer screen. still, it was but momentary, and i didnt bother trying to outline exactly what it was i was trying to do, because explaining anything in terms of design to headbound CPAs will always end in disaster. nonetheless, it was an interesting display of our differences, and further vindication as to why i can never be an accountant-im a ""hands-on"" person, and i would probably be more interested in the paper itself than whats written on it.

in other, less hectic news, i met with ellen the night before her birthday. i was the first person to see her on her birthday. since a lot of my high school friends are younger than i am, i feel somewhat depressed whenever their birthdays come-if theyre old it means im oldER. clueless as to what to give a fun-loving girl on her 21st birthday, i resorted to a foolproof solution: alcohol. a friend once told me i cant possibly fail with grey goose vodka(unless i want to shell out a substantial amount for a decent cognac), so i went with it and took ellen to guppy-not my favorite trendy locale since the teenagers that hang there are so disagreeable, but whatever. we munched on a deluxe pb&j and called it a night. the next day, i went to huntington beach for my friends' birthdays. they were a married couple and decided to celebrate their birthdays all at once. my friend chris offered to give me a ride, which saved me 10 bucks and a good amount of frustration trying to find a parking space. christie and i read our books-her with her ""notebook"" and me with my ""paradox of choice""-after which we hit hooters in costa mesa. i have never gone to hooters with this particular group of friends so i was excited. they are all veterans when it comes to drinking, something i tried my hand at but never fully tapped into my potential. we had the usual faire, the wings and fries and beer. halfway into our meal a group of guys-high school age-sat down behind us. then our server yelled ""dont do that! that is seriously not funny."" at first i thought he tried to touch her, but christie later told me one of the guys tried to put something down the back of her shirt. interesting. in the end we all got crazy and went home. christie confessed to me that she was a little upset that her boyfriend chris didnt stop her from driving, or at least giving us a little time to rest and sober up. this morning i ran a few miles to shake off my hangover, and that about ends the only weekend this summer that hit the beach."

"event","much to my delight, school doesnt start until september 4, so that gives me around a month more of nothingness. as much as i dislike being idle, i like this period of not doing anything THAT important. after all, im only idle school-wise, but the rest of my life is still moving forward. besides, this is really the only summer where i havent taken any summer school-the last one was after i graduated from high school. lately ive been reading a lot of design-oriented books (art & visual perception, ways of seeing, the paradox of choice, the natural economist, the industrial design reader, the poetics of space, the design of everyday things), supposedly to fuel my desire even more for my major, something to keep me going through the summer and as i take my precalculus class. most importantly of all, ive been reading because my mom and my sister finally succeeded in getting hold of the filipino channel-which means our tv is running 24/7 on nothing but filipino-related whatever. i feel stupider just by listening to them, so to make sure i can still comprehend college-level english by the time i hit the books, i started to read. the filipino channel is nonstop gossip, drama, and variety shows, all with the same people doing the same things over and over and over again. not exactly sure how this repetition is in any way entertaining, but what the heck. im also applying for a new job. more like relocating actually, because i have a bad feeling about this place once school starts. classes+lab+homework+driving through traffic equals not a lot of hours for me, and very tired, stressful hours at that. i dont want to be around people who are making demands left and right when all i want to do is just go home, so i think im going to reapply so hopefully i can get transfered to a place closer to home, like norwalk or lakewood or cerritos. i still havent gone to the oc fair, a trip that i have to make as i make the most out of the remainder of my summer vacation. also, if anyone is willing to take me to where i work now (which is east la/monterey park/alhambra) just for kicks, i will treat them out to aloha food factory or noodle planet or noodle world. ive been craving these places for so long but i dont want to go here by myself. and i certainly do not want to go during my lunch, because it is incrdibly hot out here, what with all the pollution and the hispanics, and chinese, etc."

"event","i havent updated in this place for a while, and with good reason. ive been very busy with life lately. i feel like im living my life as it would be when i finally have a family: the 9-5, coming home doing some errands, eating with a family member here and meeting with a friend there, and working out before heading off to bed. my job, though hardly generous when it comes to pay, is very rewarding. it is a stark contrast to my other job, where my sister complained of me coming home smelling like windex, clorox, lysol, or some lethal combination of any of those three. i dont come home sweaty, tired, looking like i labored in the fields or something. i have to dress ""professionally"" and people address me as ""sir"" and speak with a mellow voice. im away from home when everyone else is, and im out free when everyone else is. at work i sit in front of the computer all day, sometimes not even taking a lunch break, and i have a panoramic view of the la skyline..i feel like an executive; i have my best friends here, and theres of course the requisite one coworker that you hate. theres so many places to get good food here in monterey park! who knew this wasteland had anything to offer? anyway, my trip to boston was a blast. easily the best four days of 2007, and i would do it again in a heartbeat if i had 500 dollars for a plane ticket. my stepmom and i dropped off my stepsister as she is going to harvard to get her masters degree for god-knows-what major. some science i think, because she wants to be a doctor of internal medicine. im EXTREMELY jealous, at the fact that she gets to move away and the fact that she got into harvard. my stepmom assured me she is not smart, but made up for it with community service and leadership training, which makes it all the better for me since im not ""smart"" in that sense either. because of this, ive also thought about studying away, using it as a means to move out. im considering pratt in brooklyn or NYU for my masters. and then ill drop the bomb and tell my parents that im staying there; although they know ive been wanting to move to new york anyway. speaking of which, i registered for classes at cal state long beach. it was such a stressful day. since interior design people are given priority for classes, industrial design people (like me) are pushed aside and get spots if there are any left from the interior design students. on top of that, the counselors at cypress simply do not know any better, and i got very, very misleading information. so next semester i have to take a couple more classes there before i get GE certified. and theres a physics class i had to take there as well, but i will end up taking it at long beach because itll probably be more convenient to do it all in one school. so that ends my spontaneous urge to write in this journal."

"event","i just turned in my 300 point final project for my online art history class...im so relieved. its not finished yet-i have to creat a ""dialogue"" with two other people about their projects, but im on the home stretch. besides the dialogue, i have only two more quizzes and two extra credit exercises which i very much intend to submit. not that theyll make much of a difference, but at least i did it. i went to my last class meeting today for my other art history class, and it was a breeze-we all went through our lousy group presentations and took 10 minutes to go through the scantron final. after this its work throughout the summer, just like the regular folks; hour and fifteen commute to work, sit for 8 hours, and spend another hour-fifteen parading my way through the chaos that are the 5 and 605 freeways, respectively. no homework, no summer school, no worries, although i am very much interested in enrolling in a latin dance class over the summer, if they offer it at night. dunno why, i just had the sudden urge to do it. i cant wait until i go to boston in june to help my stepsister settle into the place as she is going to go schooling there to get her masters degree. i spent the remainder of my accident settlement for a plane ticket and i dont care-itll probably be the only chance i have for a vacation since ill be working over the summer and going back to full speed at long beach in august. as for other news, not much has went on, except that i started on my new job last week. its nice, very professional, so even if i do end up quitting in august, at least i had some experience in such a setting. i dont believe there is anyone under 40 except for me, so no workplace romances here. the commute took its toll on me for a while but im getting accustomed to it. also, their dress code is starting to get a bit expensive for me but i like it; everywhere i go people respect me because i look so professional...i dont take that lightly since i am a very slight man, so i embrace every opportunity i have to boost my ""presence""....i also like how everyone thinks im a cop because my id has ""sheriff"" printed in big bold yellow letters across the top..of course it didnt help out much when i got yet ANOTHER speeding ticket in fullerton with my MOM and sister on our way to-get ready for this-church. anyway, i like the oohs and ahhs and i feel just as important as my coworkers, who get paid a whopping $55-$65/hr to do the same crap as i do, which is input stuff into a ""very special"" data entry program and other accounting crap. its quite a break from washing dirty dishes and mopping floors, and its quite an ego boost."

"event","just like it was during the last phase of my high school years, ive left cypress already and im just thinking about long beach...im just coasting through my classes and waiting for them to be over so i can move on. my 3d design teacher really annoys me. he has favorites-which i understand, because i would too if i were a teacher-but he pretty much ignores everyone else, implying that the rest of the class are not nearly as competent as his little pets. theres always these few kids whose work is ""pure genius"". im getting sick of it, and hes not even that great of a teacher. he talks too much of his trivial issues in life-living condition issues and ""bar stories""-and of how he designed this and that for some company for such and such event, all stories none of us can relate to, let alone care about. i admit some of the work produced by his favorites is impressive, but some of it is just pure crap. trying to please gay people is extremely difficult. hes turning a design class into an arts-and-crafts course, thereby giving the class a geriatric feel to it. pretty soon well be playing bingo when we have nothing left to do. not good training for my high-paying, 70-hour-week design job. for our last project, we are supposed to design a hanging lamp made out of chicken wire, and make it look <i>decadent</i>, as he said. he rejected my idea of a light bulb, saying that it looks like something he can buy at a store. he always finds something to criticize about those people who are not on his favorites list. which is why im not going to class tomorrow. ill simply go to ikea and fashion island and spend money on whatever amuses me. im also doing reseach for my online art history class. im actually enjoying it to my surprise. im going to different libraries and even going to university libraries. usually im satisfied with the one at school, but somehow i feel driven to get a good grade in this class. on friday i went to cal state long beach to try and borrow a particular book. after losing to three people for a parking space, i finally found one. then i put quarters in as it was metered. since each quarter is only good for eight minutes, i tried to put in as much as they would allow. as i was about to put the fifth one, the meter flashed ""dead, out of order"" on the display. so i waited a few more minutes then finally found another one. ive never walked around the campus before, plus it was raining hard and i didnt have much time left. but i found the library with a little walking around. the receptionist gave me a mean look because i soaked the welcome mat at the entrance. to my dismay, the one book i came for is not available for checkout because it is located on one of the two floors that are closed off due to construction. so off i went to cal state fullerton. while i had no trouble finding my way and finding parking, the permit cost 5 bucks, which is a lot of money for me. i have to say that the people there are much friendlier than the folks at long beach, and i would have gone there if they had my major. they were willing to give directions instead of just pointing at some direction as if you knew what they were talking about. anyway, thats all i have for now. theres much more to this but im so tired."

"event","i have not logged on to this thing in ages. frankly, i miss it. since i have no friends to talk to in person due to my insanely busy schedule, at least 2 or 3 of my friends can read this. anyhow, lots of car problems lately. my friend pearl, whom i was teaching how to drive some time ago, wanted to pull up to a curb beside her house. she accidentally stepped on the wrong pedal, and shoved the side of my car into a notoriously high(6-7 inch) curb, and scuffing my bumper in the process. she offered to pay for it, but im too busy to even bother with it. maybe during spring break. in the meantime, i KRYLONed it, and ill sand it. its not obvious but the fact that its there annoys me. to my surprise, she passed her driving test two days later. on monday she told me she was pregnant....the youngest of my friends is the first one to get pregnant; they are keeping it and her boyfriend is very willing to take full responsibility for it (he should not have any trouble because hes freaking rich). then, on a way to a party, my sisters car started to leak oil and smoke came out of the hood. since it was saturday and the mechanic is closed on sundays, they had to wait until monday to find out the result. it needs a new motor. faced with the terminal fate of her car, were now all clamoring to find one steal of a lease on some family car, or at least a decent ""for-the-meantime"" car. but im everyone's driver, and it sucks. its very taxing on my car, and my physical endurance, taking people here and there and going to work and school. its a pain in the ass, even worse than my sprained ankle which i cant do anything about as of the moment because i dont have a primary doctor. the hospital i was rushed to is charging me twenty thousand dollars and i found out today the reason why my insurance kept denying my claim is because some medical coding idiot put in the wrong GENDER. so now we have to start from scratch and make the same phone calls and talk to the same people again and be put on hold again for god knows how long. for my traffic school, i was assigned to go to beverly hills, pay 27 bucks for an 8-4 class thursday, and either pay 8 bucks for parking or walk some unknown distance from metered parking. thank goodness i was able to go to trafficschool.com, and i skipped over the lectures and simply took the tests, and did it all in one sitting in a matter of three hours, and it was only 25 bucks. what a relief! as if that wasnt enough, my new phone started acting up...mind you, its only 3 months old. so tmobile will send me a new one-but i have to pay for the shipping. itll be all well once its finished, but id rather not have gone through the hassle. also, my very inattentive mind wandered away while i was mixing plaster of paris in art class, and i put too much water and it over flowed, wasting my plaster and ruining 3 other classmates' projects in the process. none of us were happy, and i still have to clean the work area since we share our outdoor patio/work area with the ceramics class, and the ceramics teacher is not too pleased about it. so, having said all these problems, who wants to watch ""premonition"" with me?"

"event","since ive been freed of the daunting task of having to pay my prohibitively expensive speeding ticket, i decided to splurge on another useless expense: a cellphone. i know, i know, i just recently purchased a very spiffy (and overwhelmingly complicated, i might add) blackberry phone, but i have quite a collection of unlocked phones should i decide to give my ""everyday phone"" a rest, or just to change for the sake of change. so i went straight to ebay-the first place i go to for anything i want to buy online-and looked around. after a few minutes, i noticed that a lot of these devices have a name that is a spin-off of the famous ipod: iMATE, iPAQ, iPHONE..and lets not forget those other ones: iTUNES, iPOD, and iROC(yes, there is such a car, and volkswagen made it. once.). since im very much interested in the sex industry, i decided that i too, will create a pleasure-inducing device: the iSUCK. this device is very similar to the ""fleshlight"" wherein the user inserts his penis into a silicone-lined plastic tube and is moved up and down with his hand until-presto! a successful release is achieved. mine, however, will capitalize on this idea but with a more sophisticated twist: with a vibrate function, little motorized plastic balls that revolve around the tube, and heat. the other end can even be hooked up to a vacuum hose, so it can simulate any bodily cavity that the user wishes to recapture. it even folds for easy storage and portability and comes with a travel bag for pleasure on the go! since im not very familiar with such devices (im old fashioned-i watch porn), im not quite sure if this has been invented or under development as of this day, but if not, then i will pursue it when i raise enough capital. the sex industry is more lucrative than the telecommunications industry, and my device will certainly be a LOT more entertaining than a cellphone with all the bells and whistles."

"event","i guess it takes more than one try for me to get everything right, like what i am witnessing right now with my online class. ive tried it before and failed miserably, and im trying it again with little choice but to get used to it, since this is my last semester. the teacher, with no way of keeping track of attendance, gives assignments and quizzes here and there, and just when you think youre on track, she emails the class reminding them of an assignment no one even knew existed. so exhausting! im typing more than i ever have, especially now that im actually participating in the class. one art history class is overwhelming for anyone, and people think im nuts whenever i tell them im taking both art history 1 and 2 at the same time. my on-campus art history seems a lot better though, since the teacher likes movies and therefore we are promised movies to watch in place of some lectures, like we have for the past two weeks. also, this teacher is a lot more feminine and a lot less matronly than the last one, and therefore less disturbing. the previous teacher was all over the place, lecturing for five minutes then going off on a tangent for the next 30, then coming back to earth, only to repeat the cycle over and over again for three hours; it felt like one step forward and two steps back, and ill be darned if anyone got anything higher than a C in her class. this time, the teacher knows what she wants to teach, and she even gave us a packet which was basically our notes, and all we have to do is highlight what is important; she even gives study guides and divides the class into study groups, while the previous teacher didnt ""believe"" in study guides because the notes were THE study guide, supposedly. yesterday, in my 3-hour 3d design class, an old friend dropped by 45 minutes into the class and we talked until it was time to go home. my friend omar informed me that the teacher was upset and marked me absent. i didnt really care, and i reasoned that the class was extremely boring for a design class, with such a drab atmosphere and hostile classmates, and besides i am more able to concentrate when working at home anyway. so i got marked absent for staying 15 feet away from the classroom for 2 hours."

"event","so i got rid of my traffic issues...sort of. first off, my ticket from a long, long, LONG time ago has finally been resolved. i am going to traffic school and i will have to have finished it by the 22nd, which is fine, since its already been settled and paid for. i simply have to pick from a list of schools and make a few calls and such. today i went to the court in bellflower once again after three previous failed attempts to talk not to anyone in particular, but simply to get a hold of <i>someone</i>. i got a court date for august 2nd, and i guess i wouldnt have to pay the ticket until i talk to the judge at that time. so its not completely eradicated-i guess you could say i got a hall pass. they always say that good things come to those who wait, and i hope that this is further vindication of its persistence. also, under the category of patience comes my car. i have been waiting and calling and waiting and calling but to no avail. hopefully i will get my car tomorrow after so many frustrating open-ended phone calls to ask when it will finally be ready only to hear the body shop firing blanks with their misleading responses. i suspect that my car's priority has fallen by the wayside but upon seeing the check which wrote in big bold red letters how much the insurance is willing to pay for the repairs, my car is once again on the mainstay of their daily agenda. also, since i have waited three weeks-nothing more i hope-i expect nothing short of perfection. i will make a call once again tomorrow and i wish it will be my last. im going to start logging on to my online class in a day or so. we have an assignment before the class actually begins, supposedly to help students navigate their way through the website and whatnot. dunno how helpful and valuable it really was since i already took this class and dropped it, but i guess i have to do it anyway since it is GRADED. what the fuck? being graded before class even starts? no wonder this teacher never got anything higher than a 2 on ratemyprofessor.com. whatever. end of rant. anyway, i went to linda's party on saturday and it was confusing, to say the least. people came and left, and then came back, then disappeared into the backyard, ellen was so excited it was scary, and i was welcomed with happy, surprised, and disgusted faces. but i had fun-no really-and the food was better than i had expected. i usually come late to parties and consequently im greeted with stale chips and flat soda. i had to cut it short however, because i had to attend to a friend who was having technical diffculties with his uh, self. im in no condition, much less authority, to psychoanalyze people, but apparently i am a guru among my peers, so he sought my advice. funny since i cant even solve my own problems, but what the hey, i made someone happy so i guess that makes me happy as well. now i have to go back to my art history or else im going to be lost in the mess that is the blackboard website. later folks."

"event","once again im in the midst of a crisis. i have this unpaid ticket that remains unpaid because well, i cant pay for it. its 361 dollars and im not sure what to do. ive already asked for an extension, and, ive been calling people recently asking them if they have any ideas on how to make this much money in a week or less...ive gotten plenty of suggestions regarding selling myself, but upon asking them how to actually begin doing this, they remain unsure. so now im still obsessed with trying to find a get-rich-quick scheme in order to pay for this. a friend suggested that i ask if i can simply pay for it with community service, which i will try and see if i can do that by going to the court and asking them tomorrow after school. she also said that i can opt to do jailtime, but im not even going there. my school starts tomorrow and i have this easy class-3d design. i know itll be easy because it simply expands on what i learned in 2d design which was a cakewalk. im also going to retake my online class for art history 2, and im still unsure if i want to retake my art history 1 class, which i have until tomorrow night to decide. i still havent received a phone call from the two places i applied(downtown LA and lakewood) and i really hope i get hired at either one...any one really, just so i have an excuse to leave my current job. i want my weekends off so i can devote more time for studying. seeing as how i dont have a social life whatsoever, i dont plan on going out to parties and such when i do finally get my weekends off, so i am sincere about this commitment. also, my car remains in the shop, and i already returned my pristine rental car. the body shop gave me this clunker that i immediately took to a car wash station to have it vacuumed cleaned. its still a piece of crap but now its a FREE and SPIFFY piece of crap, and i was told that i will get my car on friday for sure. i have a feeling that the body shop is simply milking the insurance company as well, since they are just letting the car rot in the shop even though it is already finished, and write down extra labor hours on the invoice even though there really were no extra hours spent fixing the car. i guess they wanted to stick it to the insurance company like i told them when i gave them the car. i did this by having things fixed that werent really part of the accident, so hopefully my car will be returned to me in a condition that was much better by leaps and bounds than when i had given it to them, and also hopefully free of charge(hey, were all after the miserly insurance company after all). now im just pretty much waiting and praying for something, and if anyone has ideas and reads this damned thing please send me a suggestion on how to make money very quickly."

"event","thank goodness its the new year! i cant wait to see what i can do to change after the trainwreck i caused last year. tickets, car problems, academic issues, financial crises, and so forth. i guess i should take comfort in the fact that all these things are easily fixed with time, money, and a little elbow grease. the strangest things happened by the end of the year, not very surprisingly since the strangest things that happen to me in general usually occur by the end of the year anyway(like 2005 when my car was stolen). its kinda sad to think that the highlights of last year were mostly sad ones; the tickets, getting rear-ended on the freeway on my way to my art history final(which i didnt do well in, by the way), my brief stint at the hospital between chistmas and new year's, and my ongoing frustration with having to argue with the insurance about my car. and lets not forget my horrible semester at cerritos college, which, thankfully, i got something in return for having to bear with. my art teacher let me go with an A because she gave me the benefit of the doubt despite my apparent lack of effort, and i mysteriously passed my statistics class. my friend pearl advised me to not question my passing grade, and instead simply relish in it and think of all the times i cried before taking the tests and my countless near-death experiences just trying to find a parking space at cerritos college. this year, im planning to finally let go of my car and maybe get something else-not new of course, but definitely a change from what i have. and since i passed stats, i only have to take two classes before i can (maybe) transfer to csu long beach: 3d design and art history, which i will be re-taking as an online course. im still looking for a new job, but now that i have more time to do so, ill be more involved and ill become more available to work for more hours. i ended my mom's suffering with my cingular service and decided to switch to t-mobile under my name. dont ask me how i got approved for credit, i didnt know either, but in any case its in my name and i got a spiffy new blackberry which everybody but me seems to enjoy so much since its so hi-tech and complicated and im not really all that tech-savvy. ive been going to the gym everyday-well almost, if you count the times i didnt go yesterday and when they closed on christmas and when i was at the hospital, but at least i feel much better from all that working out. so i guess i got something good out of last year, even though the year itself was terrible. the doctor said that stress was the main reason why i had gastritis, which is some kind of inflammation in my stomach lining, similar to an ulcer. so i have to take medication, but otherwise im feeling much better. so from last year i got better health, im finally decent at snowboarding-something i never expected to like, let alone be actually good at doing-i finally got that cool new gadget of a phone under MY name after waiting for practically forever, and im in line for a new car and getting accepted into csu. thats it, and maybe ill also try to use this thing more, which maybe, just maybe, lessen my stress."

ANYWAY. i have this friend, she irritates me so much. she has a boyfriend who is a drug addict, and also abuses her physically. she keeps insisting there is something to him that others just cant see. am i stupid? because from my experience if other people cant see what you see then youre really just seeing something you WANT to see from that person. anyway, on one hand i feel sorry for her because why does she have to stoop this low for a boyfriend. is she that desperate? i really really want to offer myself as a prospect but looking at her boyfriend i realized i dont want a hand-me-down from someone like that. and she smokes, and i hate women who smoke and it just turns me off. anyhow, i am angry at her as well because she made the decision, so its really hard to feel sorry for someone who is being hurt but letting themselves get hurt ""because of love"". i feel at some point in time you have to be practical and consider your own well-being before anyone else. i tell her things but she doesnt give in, so im tired of giving advice if i dont feel like im being listened to, especially since i feel like im always right when it comes to giving advice. i dont know what to do with her, i cant just dump her on the side, but im really getting sick of listening to the same nonesense over and over. argh."

i came late to work today. my dad insisted that i do it. he took me, my stepmom, and my sister to a brazilian place, one of those restaurants where the waiters come by and slice of hunks of different cuts of meat over at your table for as long as you can eat. it was overwhelming, but in a good way. i tried alligator for the first time and, indeed, it tasted like chicken. i was food-drunk, but i came to work anyway. during the meal, my dad also advised me not to ""clean my car too well"" for it might attract bad attention and get stolen again. when i dont clean it, he bitches. when i clean it, he bitches. argh. so how clean is too clean, folks?"

traffic school was horrible; it was hell on earth. for those of you contemplating on getting any sort of moving violations, DONT. traffic school is your last resort, and if you drive decently, it should not be on your mind at all. it costs money, it is incredibly time-consuming(7-430 in the afternoon, on a freakin saturday, for chrissake), time which you could spend doing so much more productive things with. speaking of my traffic school, i got to sit in the section of the courtroom full of obnoxious people. there was this guy who kept trying ever so desperately to get attention from the girls, even the ugly ones..whenever a girl would speak up or ask a question, hed reply with a smartass answer(such as ""can i get your number?"" or ""ill answer your question if you come here""), which would result in a few chuckles but would die down almost instantaneously. tasteless and annoying. he wont be getting any with a personality like that. then theres this black guy who keeps trying to stick his personal stories in whenever the teacher would get off subject, which over time became not very appreciated. but the worst of all was this really talkative girl and guy-who, from what i have observed, was presuming that maybe he can pick up girls at this traffic school. they kept talking and talking and talking and talking like theres no tomorrow until, at some point of the day, the teacher moved the girl. personally, i think traffic school is the last place to look for people. for one thing, everyone who is there DOES NOT want to be there, and are thinking about other things they couldve done, and are agitated at the fact that they have to wake up early and spend a whole day here. the last thing on their mind is picking up people. to me at least, the wasnt even on my mind at all. i just wanted to do whatever it was i was supposed to do there and get it over it. those two were just about the most ridiculous people ive seen..i mean, its ok to make a friend-several of them, even-at a place liks this..but looking for hookups? unebelievable. ok enough of my ranting."

"event","to all of you who read my journal every now and then, i have a little favor to ask you: if you or someone you know knows anything(preferably an expert)about wi-fi and installing wireless internet crap, i need some help. i need as much help in setting up a wireless connection for my computer. remember how i contemplated on a christmas gift for myself? well, i decided to go ahead and buy a handy-dandy laptop. i bought it online and im just waiting for it to be delivered, which is taking very long-no thanks to ups. nobody knows about it but my mother, and surely everyone(who will find out very soon, much to my dismay) would disapprove because it is prohibitively expensive considering i have absolutely <b>NO</b> funds allocated for this particular expense, and thus i either have to work more over the summer or find a summer job so that i can shave off at least $300 from the tab. again, if you or someone you know is is proficient at this kind of stuff, i need them to sort of hold my hand as i go through setting it up, because i am not about to pay a stranger to come to my house and set it up for me."

"event","i finished my finals..yay! i have a very, very good feeling about my anthropology final, though im pretty sure its the only test in that class i ever did decently in..in any case i hope for at least a c. i passed art and computer graphics/indesign class. overall this semester felt good, and i kinda missed anthropology class despite the teacher's apparent lack of dynamism, though i felt really comfortable in that class; it had a very laid-back atmosphere. im taking a summer math class over at cerritos. its algebra 2 in high school..i know im an idiot, but im extremely confident that my english/art/cooking skills more than compensate for this. the guy teaching is a tall, bald black guy..he seems really disciplined but approachable, and i think i he was in the military at some point in his life...hes just so ""proper"", not quite anal, but getting there. the entire school is overrun by blacks and mexicans, but i have no problem with that as they are really friendly and helpful whenever i ask general questions about the school and stuff, not like the korean international-student snobs at cypress who could barely speak english and walking around displaying their ipods and bmw car keys for the whole world to see. speaking of anthopology, i did two extra credit assignments, which was to go visit two exhibits at a)the bowers musem and b)the natural history museum by USC. a weird encounter occured between me and some cholo security guard while i asked for directions over at the natural history museum in la:

<b>ME:</b>hi, im sorry, but im looking for parking for the natural history museum?
<b>SECURITY:</b>oh its over there behind you..just make a u-turn over there and go across the street
<b>ME:</b>ok thanks a lot
<b>SECURITY:</b>hey man, thats a nice ride you got. do you race?
<b>ME:</b>i try not to. 
<b>SECURITY:</b>so what are you here for? you dont look like you go to a museum.
<b>ME:</b>its for a school assignment
<b>SECURITY:</b>ohh..what are you doing after that?
<b>ME:</b>go home and sleep i guess...
<b>SECURITY:</b>whats your name?
<b>ME:</b>uh...melvin...ok thanks for your help but i really have to get going.

...and i took off <i>really</i> quickly, so fast i scraped my bumper against the cones lining his booth..ahh. since i was already there, i had no choice but to proceed with my little field trip, so i had to walk AROUND the building just so i could avoid him. creep! there is this girl i like at work. she works in the psych unit of our facility, and shes always with this one short filipino guy. i think they must be best friends or something, and they are both aware of how i like her <b>THIS MUCH</b>. the day after this museum incident, i came to work where he approached me and asked, very frustratingly, ""when are we gonna go out on a date?"" i didnt even respond. he even topped the security guy the day before! huh? what the hell?! whats going on with these people? if you think im even remotely flattered by all this, then youre thinking in the wrong direction."

"event","i wonder what time my anthropology finals will be next monday?.....chances are, they will be late. it will be difficult for me if thats the case because, thats when my summer school at cerritos college starts-10:15 to be exact. that is, if i even get into it. so far, ive had trouble trying to get into that school. first was the registration thing, where i found out from a smartass guy over the phone that i had to apply all over again. then i tried, and it wouldnt let me, saying that i need to show that i had met the prerequisites first. so i rummaged through my stuff for my assessment test results from cypress, to no avail. so now i have to ask cypress or take the assessment test at cerritos, and if i pass, i would have to attend the class and ask for an add code because its already full. what a bitch. ahhhh! this wasnt the first time it happened to me, though; last semester, i dealt with the same thing for the same class, and i ran out of time before i even had a chance to register. it seems some sort of force is trying to hinder me from attending that school. i wonder why."

"event","this dreadful semester is almost over...yes!!! i dropped two classes, which is very disappointing considering my low drop record, but i think im passing the ones i havent dropped. for my friday conputer graphics class, a girl named rachel helped me out BIG TIME for my project..in fact, she did all of it; all i had to do was give her my artwork to be put in the magazine spread that is going to be in the magazine that they will supposedly publish. on friday, i went with my sister to south coast plaza so she can buy a cookbook and have it signed by the achingly gorgeous italian chick from the food channel giada de laurentiis. she waited for three hours at williams-sonoma and i came in just in time for her to sign the book. we both agreed that she was very, very pretty. unfortunately, we couldnt take a picture with her so we were somewhat disappointed. thats all that happened ALL this time that i havent updated. oh yeah, and my car has nasty scuff marks on the front bumper due to an incident with a rock on the freeway...yep..thats it. and i missed the ladytron show. drats!"

"event","spring break so far has been very uneventful; i think all the fun has been sucked out during the beginning when i went to my friends cyrile and crischel's wedding in vegas. i stayed at my aunts house, who fed me generously, and i hung out with my cousin who showed me his very, very cool honda s2000 convertible followed by a little joyride. yummy. my friend's wedding was hilariously short, about, oh, 5-6 minutes tops. all that trouble for a 5-minute wedding. we were all expecting at the very least a half-hour affair so we could at least ""get the feel"" for our very expensive outfits before we had to take them off. after that we had a reception at this weird restaurant, but the food was good so the rest was tolerable i suppose. then we went barhopping, which scared me quite a bit because i was the only one out of all our friends who was not 21 yet; the newlyweds assured me that i will have fun <i>and</i> slide just below the radar, by having cyrile buy us all the drinks and passing them out to us, like a baller surrounded by fairweather friends. we walked on the strip VERY drunk, but then so was everyone else who was walking/driving/stripping naked, so we blended in just fine. everybody smoked, drank, gambled, lost money, etc. i was extremely happy at my first taste of ""adult entertainment"" at vegas: no arcades, no ""family shows"", no m&m store, no kiddie stuff. none of that crap. not that i didnt enjoy it, its just that i actually had fun at vegas doing what one is supposed to be doing in vegas. i hitched a ride with another friend, pearl, whose family was coincidentally going to vegas at that same weekend, and who, by the way, experienced otherwise. she mostly slept and complained along with her siblings and cousins while their parents were out gambling with the mortgage payment. she didnt have fun until we dropped by this party at camarillo, where i unknowingly ate spoiled noodles-but i was fine and i didnt get a stomachache like the rest of them. since then, nothing has happened, and i believe i am supposed to be catching up on my online art midterms, but im not. tomorrow i will go to the beach with pearl, mostly to walk around and kill time and look at something else besides the computer monitor and the dashboard of my car. thats about it, and i wont have the motivation to write in this thing until a long time from now."

"event","the days of me being ""anti-ipod"" are over. my dad and stepmom recently went to hawaii and as a ""free gift with purchase"" kinda thing, they get a free ipod shuffle. my stepsister hazel was the first in line to ask for it, so they gave it to her. but she decided that she wanted the one with video instead, so she gave me the shuffle. which by now is completely outdated since everyone has the video one, but is fine with me because i never wished for an ipod in the first place. so now im trying to install the software that comes along with it so i can upload my illegally downloaded music(never mind the ""never steal music"" printed in bright white letters on the box)but it wont let me because my windows is not 2000 nor xp. damn! anyway, i have to find someone whose pc has windows xp or someone who has an ipod so i can ""borrow"" the software and put in my songs. tomorrow i have my lovely anthropology test, and i will surely fail with flying colors, as always."

"event","VERY unproductive day today. every friday, i attend this computer graphics class. i was extra hesitant today because the teacher was expecting something good from me after two weeks of not having a class meeting. he was very disappointed, but told me hed give me some time to get photos and stuff turned in on my ""personal space"" for our magazine. i was kinda disappointed with this class as well. i was hoping for something dramatically different, but as it turns out, our ""magazine"" is basically our profiles bundled together, with mock ads and ""special features"" interspersed throughout this magazine. basically, its a glorified myspace on print. on top of that, i have no clue how to operate adobe indesign cs2, which is ages beyond powerpoint. i desperately need help on this. my unproductive day continues with me washing my car. i guess it turned my relatively prosaic day quite good when two guys at different times approached me and complemented me on my car. they could not believe its ten years old. ahhh my pride and joy. then my mom coerced me into attending this extremely boring meeting which lasted two hours, two precious hours i couldve used to run quite a bit of errands. for those of you who know, my excuse for being unavailable is because i am ""running errands"". buying this, taking that to this place, picking up that, getting this from so-and-so's house, so on and so forth. recently i became somewhat disheartened when i asked jerome to go have lunch. it seems he doesnt want to hang out anymore. the only ""fun"" person i met at cypress..the rest of them are rather forgettable. its too bad he doesnt want to anymore, but its not like i can do anything to change that. i really considered him one of my better friends but as with most of the time, i lose hold of these good friends. oh well. so my unproductive day soldiers on with my sister calling me because her car could not steer(!). unbelievable. i really wanted to go to costa mesa and buy these shoes i found at urban outfitters, but im afraid they are going to have to wait because i remembered i have a credit card to pay and i am going to treat my family out to dinner tomorrow, so i canceled that plan. instead i ate at this asian buffet place. so there goes my long boring entry about my long boring day."

"event","my mom is being called to jury duty next week. while this is mostly a nuisance for the first part of the day-mostly because of the commute-it gives me plenty of time to go around mainplace mall, possibly even visit south coast plaza, maybe even take my sister along for the ride while my mom sits and stews on a plastic chair in a room filled with disgruntled people and body odor. so, i will tell my boss that i need to take the day off because being a chauffeur for my mother is more important than sorting trays and baking cookies. there was a time when i simply didnt feel like going to work and a friend of mine invited me to go to the beach with him and a few of his friends. so i told my boss-the same idiot beaner boss ive had for a little more than a year now-that im ""going to be sick next tuesday"". he fell for it, and gave me the day off. it was HILARIOUS. how can i possibly leave my job? overall my work sucks but little things like these more than compensate for its ""lameness""; plus the schedule is relatively convenient, and i can adjust it to my needs. anyone out there know something about desktop publishing? especially indesign cs2? this thing is beyond microsoft paint and powerpoint, and the fact that i havent got a single image down just drives me insane."

LOL. i cant even get up from a chair without looking like im going to vomit. last night i couldnt find anything better to do so i hopped on the freeway in an attempt to look busy/important. it turned out to be the worst decision ever. i called jonathan, and we hung around the lab with ellen and jamie...i found a coupla pairs of shoes i liked at urban outfitters...and found this thrift store that i always passed by but always ignored fearing that they sell only expensive stuff, i.e. the store next to it that sells $430 pair of true religion jeans. yikes. anyway, ellen got us free movie tickets courtesy of linda and we saw date movie...not a bad movie at all. mind you, ""not bad"" doesnt necessarily mean ""good"", so it wasnt a particularly good movie, but it had us chuckling every once in a while, even though there was the really really annoying guy who kept making comments and burping, which agitated jamie quite a bit. that place is littered with mexicans...not to be racist, but it really is filthy. some sort of fence/barricade must be erected along bear and bristol where costa mesa meets santa ana, a la san diego/tijuana border. i finally finished the second part of my midterm today. its difficult, its tedious, and it makes me wanna strangle my professor and whoever wrote my 8-and-half-pound art history book. oh well, time to go to lunch."

"event","ive figured a way to one up my dad. well, before i go to that, i have to describe the situation that gave me the inclination to one-up him. recently, my car got stolen. afterwards, he promised me a new car(well not really <i>new</i>, but you know what i mean)-again, that was a promise. recently, i informed him of the progress(or lack thereof) they are making with my car. impressed with my story, he started one of his famous lectures, basically taking back what he had promised. over the past week ive also been searching high and low for my precious old wheels, which are no longer being made. after very little deliberation, i decided to keep the piece of shit rims the body shop is going to give me, so my dad would (hopefully) feel sorry for me and i could justify the need for a new car. if i had found what i had been searching for, he would see that i am satisfied and would try to justify <i>his</i> side of the deal, thus leaving me unsatisfied with an unloved car. i know this sounds rather shallow in contrast to what people normally think of me, but i feel somewhat cheated, being given something less than i deserve, and then being denied of a very promising promise. end of story. i cant wait to go to the show ellen has been talking about. i really have nothing to look forward to next month, so march should be a rather eventful month. ive also moved about half of MY stuff in the new apartment; i took a little field trip to ikea today and ive decided on everything im gonna put in my ""space"", from the curtains that look like placemats to a storage that looks like it had been snipped out of some high school locker. i will also show off my prized high school artwork, which i still have despite their very low artistic value. ive even moved my bed frame over to see if the ikea furniture i intend to buy will fit; it will but it might be a tight squeeze. so for now im sleeping in a sleeping bag <i>in my house</i>....but when i move my mattress ill be able to sleep in the new place, undisturbed, and without the company of my sister."

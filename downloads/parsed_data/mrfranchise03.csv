"event","Happy 4th of July...slightly belated.  I worked close to 40 hours this weekend (friday, saturday, sunday, and monday).  This holday wasn't as fun as New Years.  It was rediculously busy with the rednecks in town for the ro-de-o.  
Anyway, In the last two days I have gotten two phone numbers.  I don't understand why this is happening, although I mark it down to the dim light and the alcohol.  Maybe that explains why neither answered their phone when I called later.  I didn't asl for it.  They just wrote it on their napkin and gave it to me.  I would have been happy without it, but it seems like why give out a number and then dodge the guy.  Especially when as she is walking out the door, she turns to me and says ""Josh, don't forget"" and makes the motion with her hands to call her.  Rediculous.  At least the waitresses agree with me that it is weird.  One even said immature.  Ah well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad if that girl wasn't a pretty little asian who was flirting with me the moment she walked in the door...
Anyway, I am probably going to quit the restaurant tomorrow or wednesday and apply at barnes and noble or best buy.  I think its time for a sleeping pill and some sleep now...."

"event","So I coughed up 6 bucks of my mother's money (she paid) and went to see Episode 3.  I can't believe what they did to the Star Wars name...it was the best of the first 3, but not by much.  I was emotionally moved at the ending, but the ""acting"" was poor overall, there were way too many fight scenes that dragged on and on, and it didnt quite have the wit that the original movies had.  And Ep. 3 also seemed....surreal.  I account for this on the basis that not one scene was shot on location anywhere.  Everything was digitalized and it showed.  It was cool, but just not real.
I had a great party last night.  Lots of fun, made lots of drinks for people, and talked to an emo girl named Sarah.  Really nice girl for 17.  She was sitting alone for about 15 minutes so I went over and talked to her.  Her sister later told me Sarah had a bad day so I kept her company at the party and never left her side.  She was much happier when she left, partly the conversation, partly the smirnoff vodka and 90 proof peppermint schnapps we had been shooting...hehehe
Hey, I'm a bartender.  I get people drunk for a living, and I am very, very good at my job...
So I found out Wayne is leaving Tuesday for Alaska to work until September...I can't imagine what it would be without him around.  I'd have some extra cash in my pocket for sure.  But he got me in to a few parties and just hanging out with him was fun.  Damn, no more leg wednesday or trivia nights or anything.  I'll pour one out for you, brother."

"event","I saw the preview for The Island and damn, it looks cool.  I so have to see that movie...for those of you that don't know, I did IB (International Baccalaureate) instead of high school, and the english teachers picked the dystopias for us to study.  So I have read all the classics...Brave New World, 1984, Handmaid's Tale, We, ect...I even read more Atwood on my own time!  (Oryx and Crake...great book.  I was so hooked that i took it to a basketball game and was reading it before we played)  I totally love that genre of literature and so I hope The Island lives up to my expectations.

I bought GTA: San Andreas and I am addicted now.  The car chases and drive-by's get better every time.  And this latest offering is better than the previous by so much.  The game is so immersive...I don't care much for where the story is going and it is a little predictable, but the action is fast and furious.  It had a really big learning curve, but once i got past that, it was easy.

Nyssa and I are all good now too.  I can't wait to go visit her in december.  I will be able to stay there until January too!
That's all I got for today"

If you're going to sin, sin against God, not the bureaucracy; God will forgive you but the bureaucracy won't.  Hyman Rickover.
Yes, i know his name sounds like he stepped out of the pr0n studio, but hey, I didnt name him.  He actually was an Admiral for the US Navy and lived 1900-1986.
I have had a terrible headache all day.  It was worse this afternoon and i got cranky and i snapped at my nyssa.  I feel bad because she didn't write and didn't sign on to MSN.  i guess i will just have to sleep with remorse."

Leg night is great....cheap chicken...yummy.  
I have to work thursday night...hopefully they will let me train Wayne soon so we can work the same shifts, then I can quit and work at the Olive Garden.  Mas pasta, muy gordo!  
I have started to worry myself about my weight.  I went to take a shower and when i saw myself in the mirror i noticed i can see every one of my ribs.  I am just not hungry so I dont eat.  sometimes i dont eat all day.  Nyssa wants me to put on some weight and I would like to put on muscle, but I have never been built like that.  I have always been the lanky kid.  i dont know...

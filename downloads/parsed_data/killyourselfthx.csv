"event","ever had a day where you float through it? Like this life isnt real, and you could be in the middle of someones sick games?
Or your laying in a hospital in a coma, and everything is a dream.  I wish the game would end, and reality would set in.

Fuck you and your perfect life."

"event","Well,  Thursday, if you didnt know, my girlfriend sarah was in a car wreck and killed. My love, My child, was ripped away from me. How anyone sees this as fair, I dont know. But anyone who says anything about me crying over her Will get their ass beat. I dont think i will EVER get used to her being gone, without a way of talking to her. I fucking miss her so bad. I had to talk at her funeral and I thought it fucking sucked. I had to tell her whole family that she was pregnant.
All of my problems with people now seem somewhat... insignificant.
she was one of the Only people I have let my guard down enough to love. And she was ripped away from me.    
      If only she hadnt been late for school."

"event","Well, today was odd, I woke up 5 minutes before my bus comes to pick the kids at the stop up, I busted my ass and made it down there. I found a lighter in my pocket and went ballistic with it and made it shoot fireballs, which mesmorized Sarah.
Sarah also has a problem with screaming her problems which today, was her screaming ""MY COOTER IS BURNT LOOK JD LOOK"".
that got alot of stares, she stayed in a tanning bed too long so EVERYTHING is burnt. ack. I also learned my friend Chris' babies both died before they were born today, and his parents made him come to school. So we skipped and I took him to Charleston to see his girlfriend,Hard to get my car away from the house. oddest fucking road trip ever, chris is a redneck, but a funny one. We were gone about 8 hours about an hour and a half up and back so we spent like 5 hours at the hospital, while he was in seeing her, I could only hope that if sarah is pregnant, we wont have to go through this, I would die. I dont know how chris is doing, I will prolly go ove to his house in a bit.

well yeah

Love ya Sarah"

"event","Yeah, today my alarm went off at 6, I had to mute my cell so sarah would stop calling, and I went back to sleep.
at 6:30 I realized I had 10 minutes to shower and get ready. so I busted my ass to find out the bus was 45 minutes LATE.

School was odd, I was sober the whole day.

I came home and slept, even though my aunt just kept screaming
But I couldnt care less.

Im on the computer now, sadly other than seeing sarah its the highlight of my day, well I am out
                       I Love My Sarah <3, And my Mood os Really creepy if you know me"

"event","Well, today sucked
I was on pain killers till 3rd, maybe its a bad thing when 10 pills wear off within 3-4 hours. And I got my report card back;
My aunt didnt like it, and some dick called her and told her about me being high and having sex with sarah and that she might be pregnant. FUCK. Im limited to 1 hour on the PC a night now. she also searches my backpack to make sure I dont have anything when I come home.
Report card was 2 B's 4 C's and a D
needless to say she was pissed, and I called her a bitch and she was PISSED.

well, yeah."

i went surfing today for the first time since my sophomore year of college. i can't explain it. but it blessed me. 

i also made a pig eatin good cake. i got grumpy when it wasn't as fluffy as i wanted, but its all good, i covered any mistakes with extra icing. 
i watched mike and meredith eat their romantic dinner and looked at pictures of them together on the beach and listened to their corny bullshit.&nbsp; now THAT&nbsp;makes me sick in my stomach. but i do love them. 

i can't wait to scan and upload all my journal pages this year. it'll be good to get them out. i can't wait for school to start so i have something to do every day, some kind of responsibility that will make me proud.&nbsp; going to school always helps me realize how very very blessed my life is.&nbsp; there is always something fun to look at at school. i love studying something that i'm so passionate about. i love learning about people and essentially about myself as well. 

i've been reading a borderline personality blog.&nbsp; it's the first time being a part of anything like it, and i believe i have found a godsend, a safe haven, a place where people can finally just listen to me and then tell me they know exactly how i feel, even though what i feel is so fucked up.&nbsp; i love that there are people in this world, ALL&nbsp;OVER&nbsp;the world, that can understand what it's like to have something like this, that controls you, but no one sees it or believes it or acknowledges it. they only blame you for being the way you are.&nbsp; i have to keep remembering they don't understand.&nbsp; it's not because they're bad people, it's just because they don't know what to do or think.&nbsp; i have to have a lot more grace for a lot more people.&nbsp; i told my mom today what i think is the way people get to heaven. it was so simple when i explained it to her, but in my own head i complicate it.&nbsp; it really is that simple.&nbsp; i should take my own advice."

Thank God for the mouths to eat and the eyes to see and the ears to hear the beauty that still remains in the world in some small way.

and i miss you james k




i heard a child yell in church that he didn't want to go to heaven because it's boring and there's nothing to do. and when the pastor asked everyone to stand, he proceeded to tell the pastor that he wasn't going to stand for HIM. 
it was lovely.

gillian, hopefully those tattoos are goin down this weekend, if i'm lucky. i luff you.

i've been journaling a lot and it makes me feel clean. like all of it is emptied out of me. 
the haze going through this town is tasteful.
and someone said yesterday that he doesn't listen to himself, he talks to himself.
he was talking about truth versus lies. there is most certainly a difference between the two. and there is most certainly a truth, or many truths that lead to one truth, kind of like how a story has one unifying theme. 
and this world is most certainly full of lies and liars. but finding the truth isn't really as difficult as it seems... it can be rather simple. in some cases. if you look at things through the eyes of reality instead of the eyes of the people around you, and especially your own. 
i find myself lying to myself constantly, when i try to listen to myself. telling me i'll never be better, telling me i've fucked up too badly, i'll never be smart enough, i'll never be consistent enough, i'll never break all the bad habits i know i have&nbsp; but don't want to let go of. 
but when i'm talking to myself... when i'm telling myself something... i can learn to tell myself the truth. not the truth about how i FEEL, but the truth about what i know. 
that i'm good enough. that nothing is fucked up so badly that it can't be repaired, that no one is truly wise and i can't trust in my own wisdom, that inconsistency is part of growth, and that i am strong enough to do anything i want. 

that's what i'm telling myself these days. starting to tell the truth to yourself is a nice feeling. 

and for cory... thanks for being the one to start telling the truth to yourself. i respect that more than you know.&nbsp;you helped&nbsp;show me the way."

it makes me a nicer person to the people i hate.
does that make me crazy?

i've decided that even the people i have considered my friends... are not my friends. unfortunately.
and for once, this isn't some bitchy impulse of mine, wanting to be alone and not giving a fuck about anyone.
it's nothing like that.
i'm perfectly peaceful and yes, perhaps even content, with the fact that the all the people i thought i could trust... are really just assholes. not a single one of them cares about someone else more than themselves. all they care about is what they want and how they can get it, and if it involves stepping on other people, then so be it.
i've never realized before how selfish some people are. sometimes their friends need them and theyre too concerned about their own problems to reach out and help. sometimes they try to fix others' problems when their problems are the ones causing so much damage. sometimes they lie to you about who they are because they want you to think they're a good person, when really they're not. you find out afterwards.

and these people... i let them hurt me and walk over me allllll the fucking time. 
and i am fking done.
i'm gonna trust who i want to trust, i'm going to do what i want to do, and i WILL&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;be a selfish person. i think about others before myself, i sacrifice what i want to do all the time if it's good for someone i care about, i never let rumors and faults change how much i love them or care about them. i don't hold grudges and i don't act snobby and i don't compare and contrast mistakes. and you know what? that makes ME a good person. 


so... i don't give a fuck lol.


cory comes home soon and i'm ecstatic. 
i've stopped caring what sandy thinks about me and i'm relieved.
i've spent tons of time with my family and i'm fulfilled.
and i'm meeting all the kinds of people i want to surround myself with. 
and i am happy. 

it's nice to realize your own naivety, lose it, and then see everyone else's.

"event","today i learned that 
1. the constant changes in life
2. the way my body handles it physically
3. the combination of the stress and how i handle it personally
all contribute to my overall health physically.
my physical health then in turn will attack my mental health.
and recovery will be lost, and illness will take over, be it mental or otherwise. 

which leads me to believe that the only way to avoid this, and to avoid illness in general (mental, medical, etc.), is to learn how to deal with the changes. 
so i am going to remember the changes are exciting. this IS life, after all, it's supposed to be good.
i have to see the good and perfect plan that he's got for me, whatever it is, and see the stressors as just things to make me better. and keep life interesting. 
i learned that today in my psychology book... and yet i've been going over this in my head for days now.
life is like one big acid trip, and i don't have to pay for it.

dear will mccarty,

i have so many things to say to you. i don't know where to begin. there are pictures of you all over my house. a bulletin board with your smiling face, among all the pictures of my family and the people we love. you're among them. 
and so today i was staring at those pictures... wondering when i had last seen you smile like that. i can't remember. 
i can't even remember the last time you spoke a full sentence to me. 

this breaks me. i want to scream at you. i want to yell and hit you and scream.... why did you do this? how could you leave your best friend like that? how can you leave your FAMILY like that?? 
last night i went through all my shit from high school... powderpuff clothes and prom gifts and notebooks. i was flipping through the notebooks, looking through old journals. there are so many pages with your drawings on them... just stupid inside jokes. you had written yourself all over my life. 

and now you're gone? you just disappeared. you don't like me, you can't even stand to be around me. why? what did i do? what terrible thing must i have done to get you to hate me the way you do. 

all i can think about is how we used to be best friends. you used to be happy.
now all you do is drink and smoke. you do it every day. and no one has the balls to talk to you or try to get you to stop. i wish you knew how sad you looked. i wish you knew how different you are now from the happy guy i used to spend every day with. you used to brighten my day with your smile. 

now my days are filled with worry about you. worrying over someone who doesn't give two shits about me. 
nevertheless... i love you with all my heart. i pray one day you can stop drinking enough to lift the cover from your eyes so you can laugh again like you used to. i pray one day you realize who you are... and you return to that person. i pray that one day you will be truly happy. and yes... i even pray that one day you can be my friend. 

i know you will never read this. but if you do....

remember how it used to be. remember who you used to be. 

i love you.
Jade."

it's really fucked up what you did to me. it's really fucked up that after everything, you can't even call me to say hi, happy birthday, happy new year, what the fuck ever. when you were supposed to be my best friend. 
YOU&nbsp;are the one that fucked up this time, and badly. you destroyed any chance for us to be cool with each other. 
and on top of it all, you broke my heart. 
so... i don't know why i'm even typing this. 
i guess because i would say it to your face but you're avoiding me like the plague. 
i'm assuming because you're fully aware of how badly you fucked with me. 

the thing is... you didn't even fuck with me that badly. it's no earth-shattering news for me to hear that you don't want to be with me. i got over that a long time ago. and frankly, i don't really want to be with you either. 
but it would have been nice to hear some kind of explanation from you. it would have been nice to hear the truth instead of a ton of bullshit. 

ugh. i don't know why i bother. 
i need closure. and this is it. 
unfortunately, i think i'm always going to be waiting around for the phone call from you, saying we'll be okay. it's a phone call i doubt you'll ever give me, and i should just get the fuck over it."

i absolutely l.o.v.e. everything about you, and i always will, i know that. i also know we can't be together right now, i know you can't be with me... and i understand it and i'm accepting it... but... is it bad that i still have 100% faith that we'll be okay one day? you're the only person i could ever see spending the rest of my life with. you're the only person i could spend every day with, even if it's an awful day, and still be happy. you're everything that balances me out. and i want you back one day. oookay?

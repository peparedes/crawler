"event","<font color=""#000000"" size=""2"">I'm sorry, but i just need to write, so if you dont give a shit ab whats going on in my life, then dont read. I feel so alone in my life right now. I've been used by almost everyone, and then tossed out. I have no one left anymore. Everyone around me has other people...I'm always there for everyone else, but when i need someone, its like im invisable. Thats how i feel. this one person who clames to know me so wel...knows nothing. &nbsp;Do they really know, or really care? I sit and all i want is to hear my phone ring, hoping they'll be on the other line...but nothing. The one person in the world who can make me cry myself to sleep, make me so mad, and then make it all better before we say good night...they're not there. I hate being one of those emotional people. I keep it all bottled up inside untill i cant hold it in anymore...this is my breaking point. I cant handle being al alone anymore. I cant handle seeing everyone else happy, and my smiles are so fake it chokes me. Every night i sleep wishing and dreaming that everything was different, and every morning i wake back up into my self-made reality. I know that this is mine, and theres no one else to blame....but what did i do wrong? What did i do to deserve these feeling? I know that mistakes were made..but who hasnt made mistakes? Does everyone feel this way? I hope not. This sux!! I dont know where this break down came from, or how it was triggerd, all i know is that it's here...and this is how i feel and i need to get it out. Since theres no one to talk to...im not about to lay in my bed by myself and cry over it. I'm done with that. Everytime i think that im going to be strong, i fall. This face that i put on has got to go. It's not mine. I hurt just like everyone else..maybe even more sometimes. I cover my insecurities up, my vunerable spots are made a joke. I can have anyone knowing how i really am. All i want in life is for someone to be there for me. To not lie to me and feed me line after line of bullshit...i want to be happy...to be truly happy and not just pretending. Im tired of it. So i've decided to do a complete make over...new clothes, new style, new attitude, new speding habbits, weight loss. I want to be the girl i once was...fearless and spontanious. I want to be okay on my own...or maybe those are childhood qualities that everyone grows out of. I want to go back to being a kid then. Idk...i guess ur right.. i am crazy. i have human wants and needs, and i get pissed off when im lied to and ignored. I want you there...or at least someone who cares. </font>"

"event","<p><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""2"">so i wonder what it's like to have someone tell you a million times that they want you out of thier life, and yet they still just keep coming back?? ""i dont get you..."" but the thing is that i do get you. i know exactly what you're going to do and i predict almost down to the day when ur gonna do it. I just dont understand why. it's not fair. please just be gone. For the first time in my life, im so very happy without you. I have no one but im still happy. Because unlike you, i can be happy by myself. I'm secure enough that i dont need someone there at all times to hold me. And maybe i never will again, but as long as it's not you i'll be ok. Our time has been over. Got it. Cuz im done. This is the last time i will ever even mention you. Maybe it could have been different, if things had changed on both our parts, but i dont think so.</font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""2"">ok. so i've decided that all men are liars, cheaters, and assholes. even if they've never done it i thier lives, they still have it in them. Theres no one in this world that you can trust. everyone is human and everyine makes mistakes, but you cant make the same mistake over and oer again. So obviously my v-day sucked. as always. all it is is a remeinder to people who arent in love that they're all alone and have no one. GREAT!!! i looove that!! lol. so this weekend was alright...friday night i got drunk n got n a fight w/some grl. Sat. i went to bed early. this week has been blah. wed. ididnt g2 school cuz i couldnt. today i dont have any classes. im not gonna work either. i went looking for another job. i cant stand that place anymore. its just bullshit! it's like a fucking soap opra!! im not in fifth grade anymore and im not gona deal with that shit. n it all starts from the same ppl. i dont understand how everyone knows that, but the people who start the shit are the ones who get thier asses kissed??? how the fuck does that work?? anyway. im tired of the way i am. i need to change...i acnt wait till this semester's over and&nbsp;i will be out of moville forever. no more bullshit at work, no more lies ab loving me and comming back, no more feeling like this.

Well....thankx for making my life hell. But y? when i let you win, i gave you exactly what u always wanted. So why are you still doing this to me?

"event","<p><font color=""#800080"" size=""2"">alright...well. where do i start about 2night?? Let's start at work. Well I went 2 work 2day. BAD IDEA!!! i never work on firday's and i'm NEVER going to again!! So Jess got a flat tire. We wont say how. I came out of work and strted 2 change it. Then the maitenece guy came out 2 help, so i went back inside. Well they couldnt get her tire off. So Donny of coarse flipped shit. Ryan was meeting me @ Crouse. He got there n we took Jess n Shila 2 Jess's house. Ryan followed me back 2 my house. I got all my shit n we left. We were supposed 2 b meeting Jamie, Eric, n a few other ppl @ his house. While we were driving i was like plz dont fuck around. I dont like it. So we always take the back road behind hatch lake cuz it's quicker. BUT it's never plowed n always icy. We were comming up over a hill and a turn. All i remember was seeing the flash of the back of a red truck, and thinking, ""Oh sit, I'm gonna die."" The air bags went off and i thought that we had gone into the lake. Ryan kept asking me if i was okbut i couldnt talk because all he shit form the airbags was in my mouth. We got out of the car. We had hit a big Dodge truck, gone almost completely under it. It stopped us from driving straight into the lake. It slid down the bank n stopped right b4 it went in. His car was half way over the bank, like rocking and smoking. So i called 911 and we stood out n the negative weather for about 20 minutes. My entire body was shaking, i dont know if it was because i was cold,or because i was in shock. The cop got there n let us sit n his car. No one had come out by this time 2 claim the truck. I cant believe they didnt hear it. If you've ever been in a crash, you'll know what i'm talking about...i remember it form from my other crash too, that echoing thud what you hit something. It's not loud, but it seems so sudden and abrupt. Like it's gone as fast as it came. Two guys were at&nbsp;a camp and came out to see what had happend. The owner of the truck. They were shitfaced. He saod that he had herd&nbsp;something, but he just thought something had fallen off the shelf. No budy, that was your brand new truck being rammed in the ass and hurled&nbsp;into hatch lake!! So i called my dad n had him come get us. Like 3 cops came, then left, but the one that got there first stayed. The tow trucks came n towed Ryan's car out first. OMFG!!&nbsp;seriously, i should be dead right now. I've never seen a car that bad n person. A car that i was in, that i climed out of. There was nothing left of the front end. Nothing. We slid up under the truck's ass and it pushed his motor and everything else twoard us. A few miles per hour more, and we would have been dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;The truck wasnt that damaged. It's back end was mess up though. The worst part was that is was like a foot away form being in the lake. But it's now almost 3am, i had a rough night A@ work, but that was the least of my worries now. I'm worried if i'm gonna be able 2 get out of bed n the morning. </font></p>"

"event","so i just decided to start one of these again. i should have done it when richard n i were fighting. it would have been a good one. well from what i remember from it it was a one big fight that lasted about a month. he caught me smoking, anf told me that when i quit, we'd go back out. that he loved me and was happy with me. well as expected of richard...he met another girl. as he was probably telling her the same things, he was telling me that he loved me, wanted to marry me, i'd be his forever. was still having sex with me (when he was going out with her). When he finally decided to go out with her was because he came over to my house. well we went to the movies first, but went back to my house. we got in yet another fight. i told him that untill he had time all to himself, with no other girls in his life, he wasnt going to figure anything out. he was just going to hurt everyone he gets close to. well he knew i was right n got pissed and told me ""thats why im with rose"". wow! what a way to decide to go out with some one. he was more pissed that i has slept with some one else besides him though. i was his safety net, that he thought no one else had touched. lol. well when i told him, thats when he flipped. but anyways. we dont talk anymore. he still im's me. tells me he misses me, and wants my new number so we can talk again. [i had to change my number so he would finally leave me alone.] he's pathetic, and nothing but a scumbag. and every girl will figure that out, and i'm just gonna sit back and laugh. NO PERSON on this earthknows him better than i do. he's so predictable. enough about him though. i have a new ""friend"". Ryan. and we wont talk alot about him either. he's nice, and isnt as big of an asshole as richard. hes fun to hang out with.




college. school is going ok. at the end of the semester im moving back home so i can save up and buy a car. then hopefully move back to florida with nina. idk...im confused right now. alot a big shit in my life has happened all at once. so im just gonna ride it out n c what happens."

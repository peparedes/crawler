"event","And so finally, here is my post all about josh groban concert and love. oh my god. it was amazing. and warning: this post is VERY LONG. if you manage to get through the whole thing... leave some love? &amp;hearts;<br /><br />Also, this is c&amp;p from my post to __grobanites, so if it sounds like i'm addressing many ppl, that's why.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Shut up. I get my one crazy fangirl post too"">Well, i went to the concert loooong ago, haha, in manchester, nh on the 27th of july. it was actually a surprise (or supposed to be, but i knew.) it was my 17th birthday present from my parents, and it was the best gift EVER. See, josh is kind of like my hero, because he's so sweet and funny, and his voice is just AMAZING. i'm you know, one of those wannabe singers, i mean, i'm in chorus and singing is one of those little talents that i'll actually admit to having (despite the fact that i have MASSIVE stage fright) anyways, when i have to perform for this competition called 'senior districts festival' i always prep by listening to josh! <br /><br />so yes. that was my side-note about why i love him so much? don't know why you had to hear that. apologies all around! anyways. so. i went with my parents (who are pretty cool) and i was like exploding with bursts of excitement the whole car ride. we got stuck in traffic, and i was like crying, i was whining that i was going to miss josh's grand entrance, which was stupid, because of course someone else performs <i>befor</i>e him? but whatever. i was too excited to be THINKING. that's overrated anyways.<br /><br />so we got to the arena about 10 minutes late, and angelique had already started singing. it was really cool. She sang and tried to get the whole audience involved, assuring us that if we were enthusiastic enough josh would come out and dance for us. then this guy came out and everyone started screaming. much to our dismay it took us a few seconds to realize this man was actually <i>not</i> josh. bummer.<br /><br />So. Then we waited.... a looong time. oh, let me add, this is the first concert that i've ever been to minus one in greece, but that doesn't count cuz it was like outdoors..and ... whatever. anyways. needless to say my heart was racing like a crazy person. i was waiting and waiting for like 45 minutes and then FINALLY the lights dimmed.. and i heard the opening chords to 'you are loved' and i started like thrashing in my seat like 'HOLYCRAPJOSHGROBAN!!!! OHMYGODOHMYGOD!!"" It was quite funny, because the seats we had were like amidst older people... my friend and i were the only people there our age, so whenever i started like screaming happily they'd turn around and give me looks like oohh you silly little girl. haha. <br /><br />Alrighty. so now i'll give you the song list. with brief paragraphs in between of funny stuff he did :D<br /><br />1. You are Loved (Don't Give Up)<br />2. Mai<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * So one woman went up to him now with a license plate. from where i sat i thought it said ""JSHGRBN"" but someone else says it was ""JOSHIN"" but the point is poor josh seems so confused. he goes ""um, did you have to rip that off your car?"" and she holds it up to him and he's like ""oh! for me? well-- huh? oohhh <i>sign ittt</i>. of course! silly me, i should have known."" it was wicked funny. then someone hands him a HUGE box of giant pixie stix. and he's like ""and a whole box of pixy stix, WOW! <i>Just </i>what i would expect at this concert! Pixie styx! Sugary goodness!"" and he said that last part in a very silly voice. and then as he turns to put them down he says ""I've come to realize... My fans think i'm four years old"".oh wow. so by this point i'm in love with the man already like 10x more. anyways<br />3. Un Dia Llegara<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Now someone hands them their cellphone, and he's like, 'oh for me?' so he grabs the phone and says ""YELLO?&nbsp; ... nonono don't pay attention to them, i've just uh, got some friends over. what's up? ok,alrightyeahthat's cool! Say hi everybody!! *holds the phone up so the whole audience screams hi* ...buhbye.. It's a house party! Where're the glow sticks at? *starts BEATBOXING"" oh dear lord. ""i'm gonna, try and sing another song now."" <br />4. Un Giorno per Noi<br />5. Now or Never<br />6. So She Dances<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So now he starts talking to us and his piano starts rising up out of the stage, so he starts holding his arms up as if he's making it levitate.&nbsp; Josh then laughs and says ""Someone just yelled out 'IT'S MAGIC!' well that's right... it is."" He continues on to say ""My piano's become quite the diva. She's like 'I WANT TO COME UP THROUGH THE HOOOOLE!' (*insert whiny voice there*)...alriiight. there there' Then he went on a splurge about how his music was cheezy, and how the girls all loved it and he said like "" i know it's hard for men to say how we feel, i just happen to be a butterball for this kind of stuff, so it's easier for me... i mean i know guys can just be like 'honey..... <i>poopykins</i>..... TRACK 3.. yes. that's EXACTLY what i'm trying to say. listen! straight from my heart though groban's mouth!'""<br />7. February Song<br />8. Alla Luce Del Sole<br />9. Lucia's Instrumental song!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, then Josh starts singing, and it takes everyone a second to realize where he is. No but seriously, we're looking around like, what the hell? we can hear him, but.... and then after a few seconds, the people on the stadium all the way across from me start SCREAMING! and there he is. he's in the audience on the other side! and i start like freaking out! i'm like 'MOMMY IT'S NOT FAIR! DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA COME TO THIS SIDE TOO?!?!' haha, no, seriously. if he had come on the other side, he would have been like at MY ROW. it was quite sad. <br />10. In Her Eyes<br />11. I'm sorry, i didn't catch the title of the next song, but i know it was the one he sang with Angelique. It was really nice!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So, then they start talking, and she's telling him he needs to loosen up. He defensively claims that he <i>is</i> loose, and she lifts up his shirt and looking at his belt says like 'doesn't look that way to me' then she says that while they were backstage he looked at her and said ""i don't know about you, but i dance better when i'm naked!"""" *cue the girls screaming* and he's like 'what? am i the only one?!"" it was quite funny. so as she starts dancing with him, and he's like ""WHOA, i'm lifting my feet, this feels so unnatural!' so angelique meanwhile is trying to get him to take off his belt, and ppl in the front rows start doing stuff and he looks down and in shock goes 'ARE THOSE DOLLAR BILLS YOU'RE WAVING IN FRONT OF ME!? ...well THAT's not going to happen."" In the long run she ends up getting him to WHIP OFF his belt. which was amazing. and she wore it.&nbsp; When he took off his belt, the cap of his microphone fell off. WHen they started dancing again, she positioned them so that her back was to his front, and then his microphone cap fell off AGAIN. and in response to how they were standing, josh goes ""and thaaaat's how babies are made. UNLESS you're wearing the cap of a microphone!!"" it was amazingly hysterical. Also may i just add how much i love it-- people go ""I LOVE YOU JOSH!"" and he's just like ""I LOVE YOU TOO!"" i swear to god if i were closer i would have so said it too so that you know, i could go around telling ppl josh said he loved me :D So angelique plops a cowboy hat on top of josh's head, and he starts like waving his arm over his head... he turns around and girls are still waving dollars and he just shakes his head and turns around and holds up one of the giant pixy stix. he goes ""JUST A MINUTE AGO, i was four years old!!. NOW *imitates waving dollars* IT'S OK, he's 26 JOSH JUST SHOW US!""&nbsp; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS0UDbSj<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Manchester, NH Concert""><wbr></wbr>jBY&amp;mode=related&amp;search =) that's when they're dancing together<br />12. L'Ultima Notte<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *So Josh's piano comes up, and he announces that he's now gonna play a song that ""YOU HELPED MAKE NUMBAH ONE!!"" and then all of a sudden in response to the cheers he starts playing and sings in this little silly voice ""Don't stop... belieeeeving"" and then he's like ""Can i just do karaoke all night?."" then he starts singing ""I'm a cowboy.... on a STEEL HORSE I RIDE... and i'm want-- wait. give me the hat. yea, i give it to me. *HE plops the the cowboy hat from before on* And i'm wanted... DEAD OR ALIVE""&nbsp; Then he's like ""hey! this is fun. maybe i should just do karaoke all night! *High pitched sillyish voice*&nbsp; Hold me closer tiny dancer! Count the headlights on this highwaaaayyyy. Ahem. Hehe. *takes off hat* well, that will forever bee, my karaoke hat."" So cheering and screaming, and through it all someone screams out DRINKING SOOOONG! and he just tuns and goes ""hm? drinking song? uhh.. . okay. i don't really have one. i guess i'll write one right now... (if you open the link from before, and one of the related videos is 'josh karaoke hat', click that and you can see this all) so he sits at his piano and starts playing this silly little song and goes ""iii'm a little bit drunk, doo doo do do doo do do do, iii'm a little bit drunk. do doo do do do do doo (and then he mumbles some more melody... ) cuz i'mmm a little bit drunk do doo *burp*okay. well i suppose you all came here to hear me sing... so i'm going to attempt to sing a song of MINE now..""<br />13. Remember When It Rained<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *My sidenote. which you all don't care about, but as i said, this is more for me... anyway. i like, totally cried during this song. i cried about 4 times during the whole concert, cuz i was just so damn happy. i couldn't believe that I WAS SEEING JOSH GROBAN! AHHHH!"" I WAS SOOOO HAPPY. anyways<br />14. Lullaby. such a freaking beautiful song.<br />15.Weeping<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I love how energetic Josh is during his concerts. like he has genuine love for his fans. i mean, he was literally SPRINTING to opposite ends of the stage. and his voice didn't even reflect that. i was sooo impressed. i love this man. like to the max. haha &amp;hearts;<br />16. Not While I'm Around<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *such a lovely song. WHAT THE HELL. who am i kidding? they're ALL lovely songs. haha<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, people flock the stage, and he starts signing everyone's stuff so he sat down and sings not while i'm around while sitting down with everyone. it was sooo cute.<br />17.&nbsp; Finally. Machine.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *He was like THANK YOU and left. and we were all like NOOOOOOOOO DON'T LEEEAAAAAVE! OF course he returns with a huge grin,<br />18. Canto alla vita<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * i just love that song... sooo much. especially when he starts playing the drums... cuz i dunno. he just looks like a little kid. he's like SOO happy when he's playing them!. so he leaves again. MORE SCREAMINNNNGGGG<br />19.&nbsp; You RAISE ME UP<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * oh my goodness. the crying i did during this song, hahaha. it was soo... niice.... so of course. he leaves. AGAIN. and i'm like c'mon josh. you're killing us here. so he returns and explains that he wrote this next song for moments like these that just pass too quickly where you never want them to end (my thoughts EXACTLY) <br />20. AWAKE &amp;hearts;<br /><br />And just like that... it was all over :( i was like GLOWING. i didn't know what to do with myself. we went outside and my mom said she'd buy me a tshirt. i was like NO WAY, SERIOUSLY?! so i got one.. and was veeryyy happy. i slipped it on over my dress. can i say how funny this looked? i was wearing this like, halter top dress, it was like, bright green, turquoise/blue or whatever. and i'm just wearing this black tshirt on top of it.. oh boy. so i went to the bathroom, where they were out of paper towels.someone remarks about the fact that there are no more paper towels, and this woman behind me goes ""Josh groban is gone... the magic is gone.. and the paper towels are gone :("" i was like LADY I DONT' KNOW WHO YOU ARE BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO FUNNY!<br /><br />anyways. i went outside. and we were going to leave, when all of a sudden we realized there was a huge crowd of people out back. my mom was like, you know, i bet josh is gonna come out. i was like ...yea... but that's okay. i won't make you guys wait with me. she was like, sweetie. it's okay. let's go. so i was like OKAY!<br />So we went... I had brought my cd booklet from my TROY soundtrack. and i hoped he would sign it. i was so excited. i like, couldn't breathe. i was like 'HOLY SHIT! I'M ABOUT TO MEET JOSH GROBAN! I'M GOING TO <u><i><b>MEET</b></i></u> MY HERO!' i thought i was going to die. sure enough, a security guy appears, and he's like 'listen guys, ii'm going to try and get josh to come out and sign some stuff for you, okay?' and we're all like 'GOD BLESS YOU SECURITY MAN!' <br />meanwhile. in my stage of excitement. i'm also shooting myself. for forgetting my camera. i wanted to die. i was like YOU IDIOTTTTT!! <br />long story short, i met him. he was amazingly sweet. i asked him to sign my tshirt, and handed him my silver sharpie, while turning my shoulder to him. he signed my shirt sleeve! i thought i was going to die.i was like 'LADIES AND GENTELMEN. JOSH GROBAN. JUST TOUCHED ME. *dies*'<br />I wanted to say something to him. i wanted to be like UM. I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE MY INSPIRATION. but i was just too excited/happy/overwhelmed to form words. the girl before me said 'you're an inspiration!' and this helped to snap me out of my starstruck state, so that as josh finished signing her paper and came to me i said 'you really are! you're like, my singing role model.' to which he looked me straight in the eyes, smiled at me and said ""that's great! keep up the good work!' My face, LIT. UP. i was like UM OKAY!!!! and then asked him to sign my shirt. he signed troy for me too :D<br /><br />all in all. this was without a doubt the best day of my whole entire life. i'm sooo happy. i couldn't believe how amazingly sweet that man is!! <br /><br />and with that, i applaud any of you who actually read this far, and apologize for my long crazy talking. as i said earlier, i'm very detail oriented :D<br />hope you enjoyed my recollection of the day's events!</div> </div>"

"event","<font color=""#006699"">Ever realize that when someone continually rants about the little things instead of being finally happy about the GOOD crap happening how annoying it can get? Well i for one have finally realized how pissy it can make a person.<br /><br />Personally i've been suffering from quite the crappy month of september (which is almost over thankfully), and yes i'll admit it's been taking its toll on my mood but you know what? i'm not ranting at everyone and whining. no. i've quite gotten over doing that. it's more of a 'shut up and deal with it yourself' kinda attitude. i mean, i could whine and whine about how sad i am that i haven't heard from one of my best friends in 20 days, but where would that get me? i could complain about how sick i am of putting all my effort into enriched pre-calculus and never reaping the results.<br /><br />ooor i could say that you know what? screw calc. all my other classes (aside from spanish *cough*) are going well. that's right. hell, i got a 103 on my anatomy test when the class average was a 77. i got the highest grade! why am i complaining i should be so proud?<br /><br />or i could feel sorry for myself for not making into the board of directors even though i went for their stupid interview five freakin times. buuuut i could just shut up and get over it because i talked to mrs. brady afterwards and she made me feel a lot better about myself.<br /><br />so you know what? screw angry rants cuz i'm quite sick of them. so shit gets thrown at us. DEAL WITH IT. i get to call my friend today actually and figure out what this silent treatment is all about. and i have other news my parents actually did not automatically shut down the thought of prom. or the fact that someone that i truly honestly believe i love finally made my dream come true.<br /><br />focus on the positives! it's about time i tried.<br /><br />oh yea and i thought i should add how AMAZING the season premiere of supernatural was. even though it was really depressing at the end. i finally started to like him!! why'd he die!? :(<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Kapia mera sou'xa pei pws thelw na petaxw san pouli...<br />Emeina edw na min maratheies....</em><br /></font>"

on a lighter note, annie and i are finally becoming friends again. this is a much needed relief cuz i really was bummed about it. 

i've been thinking a lot about My niko lately. i know i'm getting a letter from him sometime next week and i'm so excited. i miss him so much it's ridiculous.

back to the seniors cuz i can't stop thinking about them. exactly WHERE am i supposed to go during lunch now? seriously i'm gonna cry. i don't know. i'm stupid i know, but if you hung out in the G5 room with us, you'd understand that, hide it as they might, they're both really great guys and they make me laugh when no one else can. 
yea... and i realize that i'm screwed during graduation cuz it turns out the song goes prettty high up there, and jake is gonna be in the front row making faces at me. someone's gonna craaaaack. oh boy.

"event","So this is a little bit late, but whatever. SOme of us have stuff to do and don't have time to update every day ^-^ juussssst kidding. ANYWAYS. Yea. so last tuesday we had a fire drill at school. it was funny, cuz i was at lunch, and the editing room is kinda soundproofed. i was there with jake allard, mike lippi, and a bunch of jake's wierd paintball friends, when all of a sudden i heard what sounded like a truck backing up, so i go ""uh... guys? GUYS! i think there's a fire drill..."" so the wierd paintball kids are all like 'AHHHH!' and run screaming out of the editing room. I waited for lippi and allard, so were like literally the LAST people out of the building. it was pretty great XD
outside, jake and i were fooling around. he said something, and i called him fat and pushed him *softly* on the shoulder. so he grabbed my arm and turned me around, and then pushed me back, but i went to brace myself cuz i knew he was gonna push me (and jake is WICKED Strong), but when i stumbled back there was a stair (yea u know, that ONE stair in the courtyard? only one) and i fell allll over my foot, and it hurt. jake felt bad he was like 'well you weren't supposed to fall!!' and you could tell he felt really bad as i sat there on the floor rubbing  my throbbing ankle. he was all like 'hey, ur ok. u ok? ur fine. c'mon get up... geez ppl are gonna think i'm a wife beater or something.' then a teacher came over and was all like 'i didn't see what happened, are u ok?' i said yea, even though my foot reallly hurt, plus i didn't know who this teacher was (though i later discovered he was mr. hopkins.) i tried to cover for jake and told him i just fell, but then jake interrupted me and said that he accidentally pushed me. it was cool. the teacher asked if i wanted to see a nurse (even though we were still having the fire drill) but i said no, i had an ice pack in my bag (which lippi quickly pulled out for me) jake and mike were nice, they kept trying to cheer me up, but it wasn't working. i, meanwhile, was trying extremely hard to NOT cry. i kept biting my lip and laughing nervously and holding my water bottle tightly... i was trembling. to give u an idea, i had my water bottle against my leg, and it was shaking so bad that lippi finally grabbed it and was like 'what's wrong with you?! are you ok?' yea. the conversation eventually turned to cars and i was really bored as i sat between them biting my lip. when the paintball kids came back i decided i'd had enough, and painfully hobbled over to melissa, where i finally started crying. the part that pissed me off, is that nobody seemed to care or notice. i've never felt as alone as i did that moment. melissa was nice though, and she tried hard to console me, finally convincing me to get the nurse. BLAHBLAHBLAH missed fourth block in the nurse's office BLAHBLAH Sub nurse didn't know anything, my foot was nastily swollen, she thougt it was probably fractured blahblahblah
 
well it's not. and i went into school the next day w/ my air cast and my crutches, and suddenly everybody cared and wondered what was wrong. and i was just pissed. 
 
that's all i have to say for now.

congrats kyle.


Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh. I'm soooooo tired!! ok. so i'm in NH. wanna hear the deal of what happened today? allow me to share. *ahem*

       so. first off. i woke up today at 5 AM so that my voice would have enough wake time for districts. took a hot shower so the steam would clear me up. the bus ride to districts wasn't TOO bad, cuz i was sitting w/  nick binder so it was funny. other than that it was pretty crappy, cuz there were 6 chorus ppl and all were drama ppl except for me, so i felt really excluded. when it actually came to warming up, i felt like i didn't belong, and iwas quite lonely cuz i was scared and was wishing i had someone to lean on.
       anyway. finally we got called. my voice had done FINE during the warmups, the steam had made me able to sing since i was still recovering from thursday, during whicih i couldn't talk at all, and talking is still semi-painful. or at least singing is. anyway moving right along. i met this REALLY nice senior while i was waiting in the soprano line. back to the main point. my audition? IT WAS TERRIBLE ;.; i did so badly. by the time i had to audition my voice had become hoarse again. so i sounded bad, and i screwed up the sightreading. when i was walking back to the audioturium alone, i had to try really hard not to cry cuz i was really dissapointed with myself. i know i could have done much better.... if only i hadn't been sick. and when i DID finally get there, i had to sit in a row all by myself BEHIND the ppl from my school. i've never felt so lonely before--actually wait. i have. i really feel like that almost every day inside. cuz i miss all my friends that i've lost, and i'm so sad i don't even try to get them back anymore even tho i should cuz this voice in my head keeps telling me not to bother anymore cuz they don't even care. i felt so sad and so alone.... anyway. then jessie nitzberg(alto) came and was like 'oh vicky! ur all alone! come sit w/ us!' and so i felt a little bit better. so thank u jessie <3
         car ride home also fun, we all had more energy, and we also had food, so nick binder and i kept lauging at the movie we were watching (the graduate) and just talking so iwasn't bored. anyway i gothome from that exhausted, and went to my cuz's football game about 1/2 an hour later. WE WON!!! so my cuz's team is now STATE CHAMPS! and my cuz kosma was in like the whole game he kicked major a**! ^-^ so at least one good thing happened today. cept during the game someone on the other team got hurt and so an ambulance and firetrucks and stuff came. when the game was over the fire truck escorted our team's buses. it was so awesome, the car i was in got to the school(bishop brady) before the buses, and when they got htere u just heard sirens and everybody started honking their horns.... it was amazing. i'm so happy for him. yea. so now at mikey, george and kosmas' house. i've been at the restaurant working for the past 2/3 hrs, and while my rents are goin home, i'm staying here so that i can cover for kosma at work tomorrow. so it's gonna be a riot :/

anyway. that's all for my saturday. 

yea...

well, first off, we had a sub in bio today who was totally and completely sexist. then in gym tho i kicked ass at matball, we were playing this overcompetitive class who was mostly older than ours. they kicked our asses, and were being cocky jerks about it. so that wasn't fun.

then there was math. aaaHHHhhh the infamous math class. it sucked. badly. i hate that class. it is seriously driving me to all my limits. it makes me feel like i'm stupid, absentminded person. i don't know where i'm going wrong, but i did bad on my test grade taht's the point.


thank you hannah and arti for making me feel so much better today. arti, ur reassuring words were so amazing, and so soothing, that u don't realize how much better u made me feel. hannah-- ur silence was just great. just knowing that ull be there for me, even if we don't have to say it is wonderful. thank u both. i luv u. happy birthdya late hannah.

PEOPLE i need love. if u have anything nice to say, leave it. if u have anything mean to say-- leave it anyway. i like reading stuff.

<P>Well, in a sum up. My school year thus far has been decent. although lately i find some of my grades are beginning to slip, i am desperately trying to pull myself together and focus on my studies. it's not like i have anything else to focus on..... Currently i have 3 friends that i would call extremely amazing and close. i really owe a thank you to melissa, wendy and lauren barwick. you guys are amazing, and i probably couldnever have gone through this much of the year without you. i want you to know how much i appreciate you, and how much you guys mean to me, and that i'm sry that i've been being such a terrible friend this year, and you are amazing for putting up with me.</P>
<P>Looking back in the past, i am on decent terms with liz, and despite several efforts, Annie and i still refuse to even look at eachother. i am beginning to give up all hopes on her. it's a lost cause. she's got her vball friends and her manga friends, and i guess i just don't fit into any of her friend categories anymore, although it pains me to say this cuz she was so great this summer.....</P>
<P>On a more positive ending note, i would like to say that this week i am sure is going to be a good one. i am gonna keep a positive upbeat attitude no matter what s**t may possibly come my way. I am happy to say i have finally recieved one of my 2 muchly awaited letters from Greece, and it is the sweetest thing i have ever recieved in my whole entire life. it makes me glad to realize that ppl care abuot me even if i don't see them all the time, and i cannot wait to go back to the warm beaches of greece and be reunited w/ cute smile niko who might come to america if i keep convincing him! and, even though he's not gonna read this, i would also like to say i am SOOO proud of u niko for gettting your lower!!! congrats babe!</P>

"event","ok. here's the 411 on my life since Greece. fell deeply in love w/ nikko, who for some reason got the misconception that i had a bf waiting for me back in america. i believe that is the reason that he eventually *like the last week* abandoned all hopes of an 'us', and i was informed he liked some one else *even after he acted liek he loved me and in doing so turned my life inside out and grr*. so i ended on kinda bad terms w/ him, but very good terms (FRIENDLY) w/ cute smile nikko. 
    now i am anxiously awaiting a letter!! i sent them one, and they're sending one back.... it should arrive any day now.... yea. school stuff?

List 5 reasons you are a dork. And make them good reasons. Justify them. Explain them. Be loud and proud of how big a dork you are! Then pick the 5 biggest dorks you know and have them do the same.

1. i'm writing a fantasy book... it's 68 pages long right now, and kinda has life experiences twisted into it....... i don't know if that's dorky, but it definitely shows that i've got way too much time on my hands.
2. i've got a wierd vocabulary i use words like 'dudicus' and add '-ish' to the end of just about any word, and use phrases like 'hush your face' (a.k.a. shut up)
3. i'll narrate actions that i don't actually do. like if someone 'upsets me' i'll actually say 'you're mean crycrycrycry' and theyll be like... wtf!?
4. i've got the whole wierd facial expressions thing down. like, to an art....
5. if you get me at the right moment and poke me in the side, i'll actually like eep or something, spaz and ...most likely slap you.

cuz i can't just pick 5 ppl, i tag sebastian, annie, melissa, arti, eleni, and emily.

"event","well, let me start with the most 'interesting' news. Zach has broken up with me. as of july 9th he sent me an EMAIL (yes, he's THAT dumb) saying he's ending this relationship cuz blahblahblah can't stand being apart blahblahblah still be friends blahblahblah no hard feelings? blah.
         well that is all bullshiznit because i looked @ his profile the next day and it says ""7-8-05 love u cassandra valler"" ....well that's nice. i'm sry it took him so long to get over me... like.. THE DAY BEFORE HE BROKE UP WITH ME?!?!? well... w/e screw him.
          meanwhile there's this guy here. his name's nikko and he's SUCH a sweetheart. seriously guys, i have NEVER been treated this well by a guy before. he's really sweet and thoughtful. and he likes things that i like haha. for example, two days ago i went to Karfas (a beach) with him and his cousin..... .. .. .....nikko. *cough* welcome to greece haha. they're both funny. and we went back to the beach late (about 9/10) and know what we did? lied down and watched stars. wow. it's really great. unfortunately even if anything DOES happen between us, it'll never go anywhere probably, cuz he lives in greece, and...welll i don't. haha. so yea. also, there's a concert on the 27th (greek ppl. u wouldn't know them) and tickets are cheap (only 10 euro, which is about $12.50) so i'm gonna go and invite him to come w/ ^-^.
          went to mavra volia today, for those of u who don't know that's my FAV beach, w/ all black pebbles... t'was fun. and then when i got hom (around 9 cuz we went to mesta) i waited for my uncle *who ROXXXX my sox* and i was like 'FINALLY!!' cuz he was wicked late and he goes 'put this down and come w/ me' and he brought me for a ride on his AAAAAAWESOMELY awesome motorcycle. i lovvved it *cough* surre..... i was wearing a helmet...*cough* it was great. bwahaha
i am beginning to enjoy greece. finally. my parents leave monday ;.; actually wait... maybe that's a good thing. i can finally stop having them yelling @ everything i do over my shoulder.

greece isn't all fun+games though. there're a lot of sad stuff goin on here too. and then there's the fact that all my friends but one have either stopped or just not written to me. thanx guys. thanx.

"event","I've come to the conclusion that i sorta miss school. i miss zach soo incredibly much that i feel crying. today we were supposed to see each other *or at least i tried to make the effort to meet him...* and it didn't work out. i wanted to see him so badly and........erg!! i'm so frusturated. i wanted to see him wicked bad before i left for greece and now i can't. ;.;
    Also, i feel helpless at home. everyone at my house is so stressed out, and i try to help but still feel like i'm not doing any good. today i started crying again and i feel really bad. this summer has been going pretty bad. i miss all my friends. and yes, i shall rant again that i super badly miss zach. i want to see him, but i know i can't. plus to make matters worse last night i had a dream that zach broke up with me, except i hadn't really realized it, and my friends were like 'yea he broke up with you' and i was like 'what?!!?'. and it was sad. we were still friends, luckily, but still, the point is that i'm afraid he's gonna break up with me, that we're not gonna survive the summer. and my sister's like: 'good, you deserve better' *back and need to recollect my thoughts just had dinner* and so anyway i'm all like 'i could care less, i really care about him and i give the boy a whole lot of credit for sticking with me all this time! it's not like i ever give him the opportunity to do anything with me or something'
    gr. i hate having my sister back home. she's like a second mom except meaner than my real one. she's being such a jerk and keeps getting me in trouble and being all ARGH!! sometimes i hate her!! i'm like 'wtf, u really hate me this much1?!?!' but of course if i ever even START to show her an attitude she screams at the top of her god damn lungs 'stop showing me such freakin attitude!!' and then my mom starts screaming at me too cuz of course she overhears. i'm stuck with deanna all by myself with her after my parents leave in greece. this is gonna be a riot -.- damn.
     dinners hear also suck. nobody ever talks to me, but i have to stay and sit through them, and listen to stupid deanna argue with my dad all night, and the stress levels in this house are so god damn high that i cry just thinking abut it. my mom gets mad for NOthing because of it, adn deanna ceases every opportunity to yell the hell out of me. grr. i'm going to stop this rant now and go like scream in my room. oh wait! i can't do that cuz deanna's is right next door.

btw to make things DANDIER deanna said the other day 'you know, the bird might die cuz she's gonna miss u so much.' and i'm like 'no.' and she goes 'dad's did' and i'm like WTF?!?!? SHUT UP FREAK!! I ALREADY LOST ONE I DON'T WANNA LOSE ANOTHER AND HAVE HER DEATH BLAMED ON ME AGAIN. but of course-- i can't say that can i?!?!
<3 i miss you my sweet sinefoula.

"event","wow. i can't believe it's already summer. i feel like it's gone by so fast. like just yesterday was my first day in project challenge and i was psyched that i had ONE class with my friends.... *sigh* i kinda miss school. i wanna see everyone. 
   i also must say i'm kinda sad... i can't believe how many of my friends are gonna be seniors next year. a lot of ppl i know are gonna be. and i'm gonna be a sophmore... high school is going by too quick. zach's already a junior... ahh. i wish things would just slow down.
   i'm nervous. i'm going to Greece on thursday. first off, let me say i'm sooo upset. i wanted so badly to see zach just once before i left, and i strongly doubt i'm going to get to. ;.; also.. i'm nervous... what if stella's friends in Greece don't like me? i'm not a very easy to like person. i'm also kinda nervous about the plane ride... i mean flying's fun, but i get kinda nervous. i'm gonna miss all my friends this summer. i wanna get together w/ u guys when i get back!!

yea. i hope this summer turns out better than it has been so far. things are so chaotic at my house, and my parents are so stressed out that-well, let's just say this. yesterday my sister said the following: ""mom and dad are so stressed that they'd be screaming at you even if you're the perfect child. unfortunately we're both far from that so...."" yea. it's crazy. ah! i'll never survive! i'm leaving in 4 days and there's so much to be done!! i gotta go, what am i doing here? i've got no time! bye!

have a good summer all! i'll see you all when i get back!"

math was freakin hilarious, ms. casey wasn't there, and so i sat w/ charlotte and garett after workin w/ my gruop, and it was hilarious *except when garett stole my shoe grumblegrumble*
nothing really eventful happened, except my bday wasn't as happy/cheerful as i'd've liked *except the car ride in my goregous sebring w/ the top down was great* and then arti and melissa we had fun @ my house hehe. but still, at least it was better than last year.

"event","This day has been so terrible. First off, i was absolutely FREEZING last night in bed, so i didn't sleep very well. yesterday i felt super sick anyway. so yea, it was terrible i felt like crap. this morning wasn't too great either. i looked and felt terrible. and everyone at school is too quiet. it's like ever since jon left, our little 'freshman posse' is falling apart. i mean, i definitely feel myself drifting. i feel like liz annie and i don't even talk anymore. it sux major. i feel like crying, it's like, all my friends are slowly drifting away and pretty sun i'm going to be left with nothing.... i already feel like i hardly have anything left with people starting to ignore me both in school and out of it. to make things better EVERYONE today was talking about the whole stupid effin' scholars night award program thingy. i feel so fucking stupid!!! why the hell can't i go?!?! i'm not fucking smart enough that's why. i mean, even zach was talking about it. everyone was, they wouldn't stop. i feel like i'm the only one not going. i feel so DUMB honestly i can't seem to do ANYTHING right this year. this whole year has sucked so badly, and i've done so many things wrong... the other day... i was so tempted to do something .. stupid again. and i didn't. but it was SO tempting. i just don't know what to do. i can't stand this any more. i'm sick of everything, i'm sick of myself! and i feel like i have no more friends, nobody left that cares... no one cares.

i don't know what to do. i just look at it this way my bday is in 4 days. every year for the past... i don't know how many years, my birthday has been one of the worst days of the year. that's how it is. cuz it's the day u look back on everything that you've done in the year, or in my case, everything i'e failed at.... last year i stayed up my whole bday crying, because of events that had occured 2 days previously. tomorrow marks 1 year.  ONE YEAR!!! I CAN'T STAND IT!!!!! I miss her so effing much! she cared about me, i know she did. she was my best friend... and i killed her... everytime i think about it i just burst into tears. there's nothing i can do anymore.... i feel so hopeless, so helpless! 
i just need somoen.e just one person.... *sigh* sorry for the rant, i needed to get that off my chest."

ANYWAY then i had to keep switching from orchestra, to chorus, back to orchestra, and then once again back to chorus, and annie kept laughing at me *grumble grumble* but w/e. then mr. wright was all like 'you're singing&nbsp;my country tis of thee. deal with it' and we're all like 'WHADYOU MEAN THERE ARE TWO&nbsp;VERSES?!!?' and no one really knew the words to the second verse so we all had to read it off the back of the program. anyways, then band played PRELUDE AND RONDO!!!! which i have an unusually strange obsession with, i think this song is the best song ever, seriously. then the&nbsp;chorus song was sOOOoo depressing, and so were all the stupidly depressing speeches, and then the other Victoria was like 'hey, in 4 years that'll be us up there, and then we'll never see each other again!"" and i was all like ""GAH!!"" and almost started to cry. i don't wanna graduate. i'll miss everyone too much. anyway, i have time to wait, don't rush me. and so yea, graduation finished. took pics *including a really cute one with army man, can't wait to get it developed!! so when we finished with graduation, i got on the bus and was like 'pff screw this i'm riding with zach' so i snuck onto zach's bus and he's all like 'sure this is a good idea?' and i'm just like &gt;&gt;....shut up. yea, so i told a chorus friend to tell the teacher i was on another bus, and i was FREEZING on the bus cuz the tsongas arena had AC on and in my little short sleeve blouse i was SOO COLD! but then when i got on the bus zach snuggled up with me to keep me warm and he was soooo sweet! *i wish he were cute like this everyday instead of just once every 2 months...*</P>
<P>*sigh* it was SUCH&nbsp; a fun bus ride, and by the time i got home i was glowing with happiness, cuz by the way it turns out annie, ann, AND emily were also all on the bus. ALSO, on this eventful bus ride, i managed to find zach's ticklish spot *hehe, it's exactly the same as mine ^-^* and it's great, cuz now i can tickle him, and it's so funny cuz he all like reflexively jumps a bit and grabs my wrists with this expression like 'don't u dare'. it's hilarious ^-^ bwahaha i'm evil. </lj-cut></P>
<P>yea i guess that's all i have to say.....</P>
<P>later days</P>

anyways, yesterday i went shopping for greece clothes! i got an adorable top that i'm really psyched about, but i'm not allowed to wear it till greece, but i made a deal w/ my mom and so i'm gonna wear it on my b-day (june 20th). oh, if anyone wants a postcard from greece gimme ur address and i'll see what i can do, but the deal is this-- no postcard unless u email me, my email is dreamgoddess18@hotmail.com. you gotta email me while i'm in greece. (june 30-august 1) not everyday, but hopefully more than once.

Your birth on the 19th day of the month adds a tone of independence and extra energy to your life path. 

But at the same time, it poses a number of obstacles to overcome before you are able to be as independent as you would like. The number 1 energy suggests more executive ability and leadership qualities than your path may have indicated. 



A birthday on the 19th of any month gives greater will power and self-confidence, and very often a rather original approach. However, a somewhat self-centered approach to life that may be in conflict with some of the other influences in your life. 

This 1 energy may diminish your ability and desire to handle details, preferring instead to paint with a broad brush. 



You are sensitive, but your feeling stay somewhat repressed. 

You have a compelling manner that can be dominating in many situations. 

You do not tend to follow convention or take advice very well. 



Consequently, you tend to learn through experience; sometimes hard experiences. 

The 19/1 is a loner number and you may experience feelings of being alone even if you are married. 

You may take on a tendency to be nervous and angry.</td>

Your birth on the 20th day of the month adds a degree of emotion, sensitivity, and intuition to your reading. 

The 2 energy provided here is very social, allowing you to make friends easily and quickly. 

Yet you are apt to have a rather nervous air in the company of a large group. 



You have a warmhearted nature and emotional understanding that constantly seeks affection. 

You are very prone to become depressed and moody, as emotions can turn inward and cause anxiety and mental turmoil.

It can be hard for you to bounce back to reality when depression sets in. 

When things are going well, you can go just as far the other way and become extremely affectionate.</td>

"event","ok, so i'll admit. today started out real crappy. i mean, church was alright, but then i got home and stuff happened and it was blah. but now i'm in NH. i'm SO happy to see my cousins!! seriously, i missed 'em major. my sis is back from college, and that's got its pros and cons. it means every once in a while i'll have someone to talk *but probably not very often, cuz we're not as close as i'd like us to be*
    anyway, the point is i just got off the phone with zach a bit ago, and it really reminded me of the first time we talked, that time i called him in NY.... anyway, the point is it really cheered me up to hear his voice *as silly as he was being*, because i dunno... all weekend i missed him SOO bad, seriously yesterday i could NOT stop thinking about him all day, and i dunno why. so i'm really excited to go to school tomorrow, where the first thing i'm gonna do is give him a huge hug. 
     still, despite the fact that my love for zach has been strangely revived, i still can't help but feel down every once in a while... today at church i was listenin to my friend and her boyfriend, and he kept tellin her how beautiful she is, and it kinda made me realize that i wish i were sorta prettier.... no on ever tells me i'm beautiful, and i guess if i ever heard zach say that i'd probably kiss him! haha

nothin more to say. i'm feelin better. now i'm gonna go downstairs and anxiously wait for michael to get back from his baseball practice.
~*Vicky*~

btw: in case anyone tells zach to read this *and no, i don't care if u do, it'd be nice for him to realize how much i care about him* congrats on your game wins!!! WOOT WOOT!! 2 SOCCER GAMES WON IN TWO DAYS U ROCK MY SOX BOY!! LUV YA!"

except not really. so he invites me to clown town and i'm like OMG 2 SWEET THINGS IN ONE DAY?!?! WHO ARE YOU?!!? and i'm really psyched to go cuz a bunch of my friends are there *including megan whom i haven't seen for like ever* and then my mom doesn't let me go. and i thought it was cuz of my dad. but then my mom brought up the fact that i was mopin all day cuz i didn't get to go to clown town with all my friends and my dad goes 'clown town? wait--why didn't you go? you should have gone!' so basically i spent the whole night at home crying during intervals of time that my mom couldn't see me. i'm so upset. i realize that i'm really a not very fair person. i always complain that zach never shows any emotion, but how can i expect him to? i never do ANYTHING with him. i'm lucky to still be going out with him!! this is not fair. i'm so sick of this. i wish things were different between us. i'm sorry, i gotta go and finish crying. oh, and btw to top it all off, my wrist is hurtin so badly today.

ANYWAY. yea. more bad stuff happened which i won't go into detail cuz it's depressing and angersome/annoying, and several ppl just... i dunno, pressed my buttons today.

to top it all off i had a cherry on top greek school class. GAH! i came home and wanted to scream.... or punch something like glass.

so instead i'm gonna go try to finish writing my song, which is entitled 'if only' perhaps some day i'll actually post it up here, cuz it describes how i feel, but then........ there aren't many ppl who will actually care are there?

i mean, sure, they say they do. but i don't want help. i can't except help, and i only manage to piss ppl off. so that sux. i'm just a bad person.

'yea.' 'YES!' haha, i luv him. and then on the way home with my sister and maria *my godmother who is my sister's age* and adam, it was sooOOoo funny i couldn't stop laughing.
so now i have a headache and i'm not feelin so great, and i'm gonna go to bed now.... even though it's ONLY 12 o'clock....

"event","I beg you to ignore this update of angstyness; i just need to get my thoughts out somewhere.     

   let me begin with something good. i got my math test back today and i got a 119/129. that was the highest grade i saw from the grades i saw. finally.

  ok, so this is just terrible. one of my best friends has lost the last 4 months of his memory, and now he doesn't remember our friendship *which has become SO FREAKIN CLOSE over the past like 2/3 months*. he's my BEST FRIEND for goodness sakes! we tell eachother everything, and last night he was asking me to explain why we're talkin again since the last thing he remembers he was not talkin to me after we broke up.... i had to re-explain everythin.... he even forgot tuesday....
       I've never been in this much pain before. i mean, i like the new him, cuz he's nice and... for a change actually happy, and i hated explainin why the last time we talked i was tryin to convince him not to do anything 'stupid'. all my friends tried to console me, and i started crying 7 times today in SCHOOL ALONE not counting home. The worst time i was alone locked in the copy room... w/e. this just makes me realize a little bit what my feelings are, and now i don't know what to do. he's supposed to get his memory back. SUPPOSED TO. in TWO WEEKS. Until then/!!?! i'm at a total loss right now. i'm not sure WHAT i'm going to do.

"event","Ah yes. so yesterday. Zach came and surprised me!! It was so sweet!! He's never done that before! How cute. *^-^* anyway, also there are two reports of t-storms from yesterday meaning i SO win the bet. too bad there wasn't anything involved so i don't actually Get anything *grumble*
    In other news, i had a very *interesting* convo with sebastian yesterday. i'm glad you were honest with me. But... the next time we talk it's only fair that i'm completely honest with you too. so we'll see when we talk next.
    Today has been pretty boring, but that's ok. oh yea! yesterday i also got together with Ann, and that was major fun. i finally finished the wind temple in Windwaker, and now we're startin to collect some kind of shards....... I almost don't wanna finish it though, if it's as sad as she says it is!
     Nothin else to say, except for i've got two major decisions on my hands that are both kinda upsetting me. Wish me luck.

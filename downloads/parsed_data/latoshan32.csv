"event","<lj-cut text=""Obliviousness thy name is Onew."">&nbsp;Toni dropped the clothes she had been holding outside the door and took off in the opposite direction, exiting the building and walking in whichever direction her feet took her. She didn&rsquo;t stop walking until sometime later when she finally looked up and realized she was on an unfamiliar street and it was getting dark. She also realized at that time that she had left her wallet back in the building along with her jacket and the rest of her belongings. She went to cover her eyes with her hand and was shocked when she felt something wet. She&rsquo;d been crying. She hadn&rsquo;t even realized it, but she must have looked insane. Here she was, some crazy white girl wandering around the streets of Seoul with a blank expression and an aimless gait while silent tears she didn&rsquo;t even realize were there fell from her eyes. She needed to get a grip.<br /><br />Lucky for her she always kept her cellphone handy. She quickly ran through who she could call for help. Taemin was a laughable option. Minho had told her he was going to be playing soccer with some of his hyungs that evening and she didn&rsquo;t want to bother him. The name that flashed through her mind at that point was Onew&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;d been getting along really well in their sessions, and he had been doing a good job at keeping his hands to himself. They had formed a frail friendship, and she believed him when he said he didn&rsquo;t want to do her any harm.<br /><br />Seeing this as her last resort she reluctantly called Onew, told him some of the nearby landmarks, apologized about 40 times, then went into the nearest restaurant to wash her face and wait for him. She must have been crying harder than she thought, because her eyes were already starting to swell. She splashed a few handfuls of cold water onto her face, scrubbing her eyes and calming her breathing. This wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world. They weren&rsquo;t really even anything. Really&hellip;.she zoned out again and stood there staring into space for who knows how long. She caught herself once again and went outside to see a waiting Onew at the curb.<br /><br />She forced a smile on her face and got into the car.<br /><br />&lsquo;You really do get lost easily, huh?&rsquo; She grunted in response, her body turned toward the door. She wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to talk right now, and she prayed he could read the air. He couldn&rsquo;t. Obliviousness thy name is Onew. He kept pressing her to talk, making random small talk about the show or the weather, even bringing up that he wanted to eat her cooking again. Everything he said made her think of something that had happened with Taemin. She felt like an idiot. It had turned out to be exactly what she was afraid it would be: her off liking him all on her own, caring about him, thinking about him all the time while he was just playing with her. She had told herself not to get involved with anyone again for this very reason. It just seemed that no matter how many times she got hurt or it happened, she still clung to the hope that there was going to be that one who was different, the one who would love her for everything she was and want her even more for everything she wasn&rsquo;t. She couldn&rsquo;t stop the tears from flowing again, but she swiped at them as quickly as they fell before he had the chance to see them&mdash;she hoped.<br /><br />&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; He asked, shocking her temporarily from how sudden it seemed. When she didn&rsquo;t answer he repeated the question. She opened her mouth to answer, but shut it when she felt tears welling up again. It wouldn&rsquo;t do her any good to talk about it. If she talked about it, then the string that was holding her together would break and she would crumble.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it.&rsquo; Her voice was thick with the tears she was trying to stifle, and Onew took the hint this time. That didn&rsquo;t mean he was going to leave her alone though. When they got to her apartment building she thanked him quickly and rushed out of the car and into the building, trying to get there as quickly as she could so that he wouldn&rsquo;t pry anymore. He parked as fast as he could and followed behind her to her apartment. She hadn&rsquo;t locked the door when she came bursting in, so he knocked but when no reply came he just went on in.<br /><br />He couldn&rsquo;t see her anywhere around, but he heard rustling coming from where he knew her bedroom was. He went back to the room and saw an open suitcase lying on the floor, clothes clumsily thrown in it while Toni was at her closet pulling clothes out, hangers and all and throwing them anywhere to just get them out.<br /><br />&lsquo;Toni&hellip;.what are you doing?&rsquo; He asked- concerned about what was happening with her.<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t answer him, but instead kept frantically ripping her clothes from their hangers and slinging them in the general direction of the suitcase. He walked over to her and grabbed her by her wrists, forcing her to stop. She tried to pull away but he held on.<br /><br />&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?!&rsquo; He asked more forcefully.<br /><br />&lsquo;Let me GO!&rsquo; She yelled up at him, sliding her wrists from his hands. &lsquo;I HATE IT HERE!&rsquo; She screamed, stomping past him and heading out of the room. &lsquo;No one wants me here. No one!&rsquo; She hesitated in the living room, pacing back and forth and looking around frantically like she had come there for a reason but couldn&rsquo;t remember what it was. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone here. I don&rsquo;t know the food or the culture. People are always whispering about me behind my back. Whenever I go out I get stared at the entire time. And&hellip;&rsquo; she trailed off when her eyes locked onto the honeysuckles located by the door. She walked over to the vase and stared at the flowers for a few seconds. Her face showed so many emotions that Onew couldn&rsquo;t even begin to guess what she was thinking. Suddenly, she picked up the vase and threw it across the room, shattering it into pieces and leaving the flowers strewn across the floor. She looked at the shattered pieces, the water starting to creep across the floor, touching the fallen petals as it went, and she collapsed.<br /><br />She huddled on the floor, covering her face with both her hands and sobbing so hard she was physically shaking. Onew couldn&rsquo;t take the sight. He didn&rsquo;t know what had happened to get her so upset, but he could pretty much guess who was to blame. Before he could stop himself he was at her side. The usual prickly woman who kept him at arm&rsquo;s length now seemed to cling to him, seeking comfort from whatever was so painful that she would let him see her crying. She buried her head in his chest and let him hold her, not wanting him to see her crying but not being able to stop herself.<br /><br />Onew finally cleared his throat. &lsquo;Toni, I need to show you something.&rsquo;<br /><br />She sniffled, finally pulling back from his chest and wiping away the tears on her face. &lsquo;Onew, I really don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m in any state to go anywhere.&rsquo; She croaked out, her throat sore from how harshly she had been crying.<br /><br />&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll want to see this, I promise. Plus,&rsquo; He smoothed down the hair on either side of her face before leaning forward and planting a small kiss on her forehead. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you look more beautiful. Can&rsquo;t you trust me? Aren&rsquo;t we friends?&rsquo; She blushed from his words and actions and felt her heartbeat quicken. Damn heart. She closed her eyes and nodded. He grabbed her hand and pulled her up.<br /><br />&lsquo;Let me at least-&lsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;No. I have to show you now before I lose my nerve.&rsquo; He set his jaw, and for the first time Toni noticed how handsome he was. She lowered her head, feeling ashamed. Was she really any better than Taemin? She hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything with Onew, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her heart from beating when she was with him. Besides, it had never been said that her and Taemin were anything more than friends&hellip;that they were anything at all. So why was she acting like a brat? Just because she had decided on her own that she could try giving them a chance, just because when she closed her eyes he was the one she thought about, just because she felt his touch on her body any time she didn&rsquo;t distract herself from it, didn&rsquo;t make them anything. She had gotten herself worked up and hurt herself, just like she always did. As soon as she had done it, she regretted breaking the flower vase. She was supposed to be the adult and yet here she was striking out at anything that made her think of Taemin. Those flowers had always been a comfort to her when she was lonely, knowing someone was thinking of her, but now they just made the pain of what she felt for Taemin prickle up and stab at her heart again. She was embarrassed by her actions, but she still couldn&rsquo;t get over it. Her chest was tight and she still had the ball in the pit of her stomach. She kept seeing Taemin and Sulli, and she wanted more than anything to stomp out the feelings she had tried so hard not to let blossom.<br /><br />She lowered her head when they left the building, partly in shame from how she looked, and partly because she didn&rsquo;t want to look at anyone right now. Onew never let go of her hand, even when they stopped walking and got into the taxi. Toni was too tired to bother lecturing him, and frankly, she liked the comfort his hand provided her.<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t recognize were they were going, but the car ride only took a few minutes before it stopped in a residential neighborhood. Onew paid the cabbie and tugged on Toni&rsquo;s hand, pulling her after him. He smiled, trying to reassure her. She looked around at the place he had brought her to.<br /><br />It was a quaint neighborhood, with small houses lined up neatly along the street. It was such a cute neighborhood, and not something Toni would have expected to see in Seoul. He opened the little gate in front of them and led her up the small rock pathway to the front door.<br /><br />&lsquo;Where are we?&rsquo; She finally asked, her curiosity overcoming her reluctance to speak. Onew turned around and gave her one of his brilliant smiles that he was so well known for, stopping her heart.<br /><br />&lsquo;My house.&rsquo; He said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. He pulled out his keys and opened the door. &lsquo;My parents shouldn&rsquo;t be home for a while, so we should have some time.&rsquo; Toni got nervous when she heard those words, finally realizing what was happening. She had let him lead her away from the places she knew to where she was bound to get lost if she left, dragged her to the house where they were completely alone, and he still hadn&rsquo;t let go of her hand. She pulled it away finally, suddenly overly aware of his presence. He looked at her, seeming to know what she was thinking, and grinned before grabbing her hand again.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not letting you go anymore.&rsquo; He smiled at her and led her through the house to the back door. She wasn&rsquo;t used to Onew being like this. She had seen so many things from him&mdash;being rough and mean, acting like a dork, trying his hardest to change her mind about him, putting his everything into all that he did, being so kind it made her want to cry&hellip;he was really amazing. Had her mind always been so clouded with Taemin that she had failed to see that??<br /><br />When they went outside a familiar smell hit her in the face automatically. Even though he hadn&rsquo;t said anything yet, she felt anxious, already having some idea of what it might be he was going to say. He stopped her outside the door and paused for a second, carefully choosing his words.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&hellip;&hellip;it&rsquo;s probably easier just to show you.&rsquo; He motioned for her to follow him and they went out into his backyard. It was so pretty. Someone raised a garden, and the flowers were obviously well tended to. She couldn&rsquo;t begin to name half of all the flowers that were growing there, and they looked beautiful surrounding a pretty swing. He walked over to the swing and sat down. She followed him. She looked over at him, waiting for him to say something, anything, but he just continued staring out into space with a silly grin on his face. She looked to where he was looking and gasped when she saw what it was that he was smiling at. Right in front of the swing was a beautiful tuft of honeysuckles, the likes of which matched perfectly with the ones she had just left lying all over her floor. She furrowed her brows and looked at him, waiting for some kind of explination.<br /><br />&lsquo;Wha&hellip;..ho&hellip;&hellip;just&hellip;.what does all this mean Onew? Why did you pull me all the way out here and show me this?&rsquo; Her heart thumped in anticipation of his answer, hoping that she was both right and wrong.<br /><br />&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to tell you.&rsquo; He started. &lsquo;When you came over, I had said and done some awful things to you, and I really did feel bad about it, so it started out as me just wanting to apologize to you. You always smelled so sweet just like these flowers my mom grows, so I thought I would leave you some. Then I wanted to give you more and more.&rsquo; He looked over at Toni, staring into her eyes, his expression now turned serious. &lsquo;I was really happy when you told me how much they meant to you, that they reminded you of home and made you feel not so sad. I hated it that you thought Taemin had given them to you though&hellip;I just didn&rsquo;t know how to tell you. I thought as long as thinking that made you happy, then it was fine to let you go on thinking it. But it&rsquo;s not. I don&rsquo;t want to see you cry anymore.&rsquo; He leaned over and touched her hair again before gently stroking her cheek. She stared up at him, her eyes wide from everything he had just told her. So&hellip;Taemin hadn&rsquo;t been the one leaving her those. They had always been such a saving grace for her, always able to bring a smile to her face. She had thought that the brat had been the one doing that, showing her that he was thinking of her. He wasn&rsquo;t. It was Onew. It had been Onew all along who had been thinking of her and doing anything he could to make her smile and forget her worries.<br /><br />She looked at him again, staring at her. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to kiss me.&rsquo; She felt her breath catch, and her mind raced with everything that came along with that thought. Was she really going to let him? She was just crying over another guy not even 20 minutes ago. What would this mean? Onew didn&rsquo;t seem like the type of guy who would want just a casual fling, at least not from her. When she looked into his eyes and the serious expression he had on his face she felt herself go numb and every thought she had in her mind vanished. She didn&rsquo;t even mean to, but when he brought his face close to hers she automatically closed her eyes.<br /><br />&lsquo;JINKI!&rsquo; A female voice called from behind them. They both pulled back quickly, like two teenagers that had been caught by a parent. Toni thought her chest was going to explode from how quickly her heart beat at the sudden intrusion. Onew stood up quickly, looking in the direction the voice had come from.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ah, mom! You&rsquo;re home early!&rsquo; He walked over towards the open back door, leaving Toni sitting there trying to catch her breath and stop her head from spinning. Onew greeted his mom then came back outside not long after, pulling Toni up. &lsquo;Come on, she wants to meet you.&rsquo; He smiled at her, automatically making her feel more at ease.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew, please, I can&rsquo;t. I look terrible right now. I can&rsquo;t meet someone for the first time&hellip;especially not your mom.&rsquo; He smiled even bigger when he heard the word especially.<br /><br />&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, she&rsquo;s going to love you. She&rsquo;s not the kind of person who worries about things like that. She&rsquo;s my mom.&rsquo; His pride at wanting to show off his mom shone through, and Toni finally smiled again, happy to see him so excited. He looked like a little kid right now, his excitement bubbling over to her and making her want to ruffle up his hair.<br /><br />&lsquo;Alright, but if I say or do anything stupid, please save me.&rsquo; She begged.<br /><br />&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it may be more fun to make you suffer~&rsquo; He teased, his eyes twinkling. Her mouth opened to protest but he grabbed her hand again and they went back inside the house.<br /><br />&lsquo;Mom, this is Toni. She works at SM. She&rsquo;s from America. Toni, this is my mom.&rsquo; Toni bowed to Onew&rsquo;s mom and she smiled at Toni, that all too beautiful smile. It was obvious where Onew had gotten it from. Even though they had just meant, Toni felt so at ease with his mother, maybe because of how much she reminded her of Onew.<br /><br />She insisted on cooking something for them to eat, and Toni stayed in the kitchen to help her prepare. His mom had shooed Onew off to do something around the house so that she could get to know Toni a little better without having him lurking around. Toni half expected for his mom to suddenly switch as soon as he left the room, the way she had seen women behave in dramas, but it was the exact opposite of that. If anything, she acted even nicer. She must have realized how nerve racking it was for Toni to be in this situation.<br /><br />&lsquo;Our Jinki has always been a good boy.&rsquo; She said after a while. They had been making small talk about cooking and things while they prepared the ingredients for dinner. &lsquo;He always worked harder than anyone to try to make things easier for us. He didn&rsquo;t want us to see how hard it was for him, so he always only showed us his smiling face, but it couldn&rsquo;t have been easy.&rsquo; She paused, wiping at her eyes and the tears that were building up there. &lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t have a lot when he was younger, so I always felt guilty for that. When I would tell him sorry he would just smile at me and ask why in the most sincere way. He&rsquo;s a son I&rsquo;m proud to call mine.&rsquo; Toni felt herself tearing up from seeing Onew&rsquo;s mother cry for her son. She was honored to see this side of Onew&rsquo;s life. Talking to his mother, cooking with someone else, feeling a parents&rsquo; affection for their child&mdash;it reminded her of her family and it made her miss them even more.<br /><br />&lsquo;You&rsquo;re the first girl he&rsquo;s ever bothered to bring home, so you have to be pretty special to him.&rsquo; She stopped what she was doing and looked over at Toni, taking her hand between her own. &lsquo;I feel bad towards him a lot. He had it a little harder growing up than some others. Please, take care of him. Look out for him when I can&rsquo;t be there to.&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni didn&rsquo;t know what to say. She wasn&rsquo;t sure she was allowed to even make such a promise, but she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself from agreeing to anyway. Once Toni agreed, his mother&rsquo;s face lost its worry and went back to the carefree expression she had been used to seeing the entire day.<br /><br />&lsquo;I knew when I saw two pairs of shoes in the doorway that something nice would be happening today. Onew finally showed someone his swing.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;His swing?&rsquo; Toni questioned.<br /><br />&lsquo;He put that swing out there himself. I&rsquo;ve always liked gardening, but Jinki never really cared much for flowers until I planted the honeysuckles out there. Whenever he would get upset enough that he couldn&rsquo;t hide it he would go straight back there and just sit in the middle of them. He would stay out there a while and come back in and be as calm as if nothing had ever happened. It made me feel a little better knowing he had something to turn to, even if he didn&rsquo;t want to bother us with it.&rsquo; She sighed and continued cutting up the vegetables. Toni sat there watching her and tried to absorb everything she had been told about Onew. At dinner she kept catching herself staring at him. There was so much more to him than she had originally thought. He would smile at her when their eyes met and she would immediately turn away and blush about being caught. She could hear him laughing from her side and she wanted to reach under the table and kick him. His mom seemed to see this too, because the whole dinner she sat there smiling.<br /><br />When dinner finished and it was time to go, his mother gave him a huge hug and held onto her son, giving him a hug that only a mother can. Toni was surprised when she got the same hug. &lsquo;You can come back any time you want to. I&rsquo;d like it if you&rsquo;d bring Jinki, but even if you can&rsquo;t, you come anytime you&rsquo;d like.&rsquo;  She couldn&rsquo;t stop the tears that welled up in her eyes. She had never felt as welcome in Korea as in that very moment.<br /><br />&lsquo;Really?&rsquo; She asked, wiping her eyes and smiling at Onew&rsquo;s mom. She nodded and Toni gave her a hug this time. She reminded her so much of her own mother that she couldn&rsquo;t help it. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I just miss my mom and you remind me a lot of her.&rsquo; She apologized quickly. Onew&rsquo;s mom just smiled back at her.<br /><br />&lsquo;It&rsquo;s okay sweetie. Remember, you&rsquo;re welcome here anytime.&rsquo; Toni sighed, relieved. She still wasn&rsquo;t sure what was crossing the line in Korea, and she was nervous a lot about doing something rude or unacceptable and upsetting people.<br /><br />Onew had called a cab and they started back to Seoul. They went to her apartment building and Toni exited, waiting for Onew to do the same. He looked confused but happy all the same. He hadn&rsquo;t been expecting for her to want him to come up, and frankly he was a little scared to hear what her reaction would be to his sudden confession. He hadn&rsquo;t come out and straight said what his feelings for her were, or how deep they truly flowed, but he knew she could feel it. He paid for the cab and followed her up to her apartment.<br /><br /><br />Toni stood in her doorway and sighed when she saw the mess she had left. She went over to the broken flowers and began gently picking them up.<br /><br />&lsquo;You can just throw them away.&rsquo; Onew said softly, coming up behind her. She shook her head.<br /><br />&lsquo;If I had known they were from you&hellip;&rsquo; She looked down at the crumpled flowers in her hand. &lsquo;I would have taken better care of them. This is what I always do, though. I miss the important things until they&rsquo;re broken or messed up beyond repair.&rsquo; She laid the flowers down on the counter, not bothering with the bits of broken glass or the water that was still on the floor. She left it and went back to her room, sighing even deeper when she saw the mess of frenzied clothes that were thrown about everyone.<br /><br />She stepped over the piles and went to her bed, sighing as she lay down. Onew kept following after her like a puppy. She couldn&rsquo;t help but think it was adorable. He hovered by the bed, unsure what to do with himself.<br /><br />&lsquo;You can lay down too, but only if you can keep your hands to yourself.&rsquo; She added emphasis onto the last part. He nodded and then lay down tensely, trying not to think about her being in bed next to him. He nearly jumped out of the bed when he felt her fingers entwine with his. He looked over at her and saw her lying there with her eyes closed. Had she fallen asleep? Was this just a dream and he was playing the role of whoever she was seeing behind her eyes? His questions were answered when she opened her mouth and began speaking.<br /><br />&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be with you right away.&rsquo; He felt his heart drop at her words and then soar again when he heard the last part.<br /><br />&lsquo;Right away?&rsquo; He asked, his voice giving away his hope. She smiled gently and continued on.<br /><br />&lsquo;Everything about you is so warm. Even touching your hand&hellip;&rsquo; her fingers clasped onto his tighter. &lsquo;It feels like it&rsquo;s warming me up from the inside out and it makes me so happy. I want more of this happiness. But I can&rsquo;t be selfish and lie to you. I do have feelings for someone else right now. I don&rsquo;t know what they mean, and I don&rsquo;t know what I feel for you means, but I want to find out.&rsquo; She finally opened her eyes and looked into his, their faces just inches apart. &lsquo;I think I need you in my life right now. Is that okay? Are you willing to try with me even though I&rsquo;m such an idiot?&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t respond to her, but pulled her closer to him, untangling their hands and pulling her against him. She didn&rsquo;t fight him but instead let herself sink into him, feeling the contours of his body melt against her own. She sighed into his neck and closed her eyes again. She could hear his heartbeat and it sounded just as fast as hers. They fell asleep like that, holding onto each other and feeling the warmth that came along with the other person that only they seemed to have.</lj-cut>"

"event","&nbsp;Toni startled awake suddenly the next morning. She wasn&rsquo;t sure why she had woken up so suddenly, but her fluttering eyelids were followed by a pounding headache and a churning stomach. She thought for two seconds about lying back down and sleeping the day away, but the reason for her abrupt awaken was made apparent. Someone was at the door and from the sounds of it they were impatient. Toni rubbed her eyes and groaned, rolling out of bed and making her way to the door to see what the big damn rush was.<br /><br />When she opened the door, she was shocked to see the face that greeted her. Someone shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to look that good in the morning. She looked at Taemin and then at herself, the tiny crumpled nightgown that didn&rsquo;t leave much to the imagination, felt her hair that still had a little bit of straight left in it from the night before, widened her eyes while she looked at him once more, then practically fled to her room leaving him standing there chuckling in the doorway.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be out in 5 minutes.&rsquo; She screamed through the door. He sat down in the living room while she looked at herself in the mirror. She closed her eyes and bit down on her lip from what she saw. She never was a good sleeper, so she talked and moved around the entire night. She hadn&rsquo;t taken her make-up off from last night and apparently she had made it her mission to smear it all over her face. She face palmed at knowing she had let Taemin see this face. She took a quick shower, towel dried her hair, pulled some clothes on and quickly went into the living room to greet Taemin.<br /><br /><br />&lsquo;Sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t really expecting company,&rsquo; she explained hastily, going into the kitchen to get something to drink.<br /><br />&lsquo;Noona, you called me last night and asked me to come over today.&rsquo; Toni nearly spit her water everywhere.<br /><br />&lsquo;WHY?!&rsquo; She gasped, choking down her water.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you everything you said, where would the fun be in that??&rsquo; He stood from the couch and made his way into the kitchen. &lsquo;Long story short, you told me you wanted to learn how to do the Replay dance. Something about you loving noona neomu yeppeo~&rsquo; He broke out in chuckles that made Toni want to hit her head against the refrigerator she was standing in front of.<br /><br />She turned her back to him and released a strained sigh. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time she had done something like this. She was a terrible drunk, and she shuddered thinking about what she had said or done in front of Onew. She would have to make something later to make it up to him, but right now she had a more pressing matter, and it was sitting in her kitchen.<br /><br />She would be lying if she acted like she didn&rsquo;t want to go with Taemin to learn the dance, and she remembered what he had told her the last time they had met. Biting on her lower lip she turned around to face him. She really did want to learn the dance, and she guessed drunk her had been able to say what sober her couldn&rsquo;t.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ok. Yeah, I want to learn it. You&rsquo;ll teach me?&rsquo; Taemin smiled up at her and she felt that flutter in her chest that was becoming all too familiar when she was around him.<br /><br /><br />It was harder that she thought it would be. They had left her apartment and made their way to one of the unused dance studios in SM to practice. While Toni knew how to move her body in time to the rhythm, picking up choreography was something she had a problem with.<br /><br />She paused to take a breath, stopping midway in the choreography and wiping the sweat from her forehead. The room was too hot, and their movements only worked to cause them to sweat more. Their clothes clung to their bodies, and the stray strands of hair that were out were sticking to their faces and necks.<br /><br />Taemin had surprised her with how good of a teacher he was. She had thought he would get impatient with her really fast, but he actually turned out to be a patient and knowledgeable instructor. He broke down the moves in a way that even she could understand and went over them with her until she had a full grasp on them. This kid&hellip;he kept surprising her.<br /><br />She nodded at him that she was ready to go again, and this time it was for a difficult part. She had been adamant in saying that she wanted to learn Taemin&rsquo;s solo dance part, and even though he had given her a side look and tried every way to talk her out of it, she wouldn&rsquo;t listen. She was doing fine until they got to the part where she had to slide backwards. Apparently, they hadn&rsquo;t measured out the distance between them properly, because somehow or another her legs got tangled up with his and they tumbled to the ground in a mess of limbs and clothes and general disarray.<br /><br />Toni squinched her eyes shut in wait for the pain that would come from her head hitting the hard floor, but it didn&rsquo;t come. Instead she opened them slowly to see Taemin hovering with his face just inches above her.<br /><br />In the time they were toppling over, Taemin had maneuvered himself so that he would take most of the force of the fall. He caught her head and landed with a thud next to her, shaking off any pain he may have been feeling to make sure she was alright.<br /><br />Toni processed all this within the span of a few seconds. He didn&rsquo;t ask her if she was alright. Instead, he scanned her face and body for signs that something was wrong before bringing his eyes back to hers again. Being so close to him was difficult. Feeling him touching her was nearly impossible. She didn&rsquo;t understand it, but whenever he touched her she felt herself tingle all over, and even though she knew it wasn&rsquo;t allowed in every possible way, she was so strongly attracted to him that fighting it was wearing her out.<br /><br />All those reasons and a thousand more were why Toni shut her eyes when Taemin closed the distance between them and touched his lips to hers. The corners of his mouth turned up a little when he realized that for the first time since California she wasn&rsquo;t fighting him.<br /><br />He positioned himself so that his body was above hers, pressing his weight down against her in such a heavenly way that she couldn&rsquo;t stop the moan that escaped from her lips. She wrapped her arms around his neck and laced her fingers through his hair, playing with it gently. He pulled black slightly from the feel.<br /><br />She opened her eyes when she felt his warmth leave her, and the look on his face was so confusing. She didn&rsquo;t know it, but he wasn&rsquo;t used to being touched and treated so tenderly. With Taemin, it always came down to just sex, and what it took for him to get to that with a woman. He wasn&rsquo;t used to actually having to try to win someone over, to getting to know them and considering their feelings instead of just his own. When he felt Toni&rsquo;s fingers thread so gently through his hair while she opened herself up body and heart beneath him&mdash;it scared him.<br /><br />He sat up quickly, turning his back to her and pushing the fallen hair out of his eyes. Toni laid there trying to calm herself down. She didn&rsquo;t know what had made him stop, but she could only be thankful that he had. She was too wrapped up in him, too willing to follow his lead. The last thing she needed to do was get caught making out in an empty room at her workplace like a horny teenage girl.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&hellip;um&hellip;.&rsquo; She started, sitting up behind him. He made a &lsquo;che&rsquo; noise waiting for the typical scolding and lecture she always gave him. She was too shaken up for that today, however. It was different this time. He had felt it and she had felt it. &lsquo;I have to go to the bathroom.&rsquo; She explained lamely, getting up and making her hasty exit before she looked at his face and fell into him again.<br /><br />She got to the bathroom and really didn&rsquo;t have anything to do. She looked into the mirror at her flushed face and the lips that had just been touching Taemin&rsquo;s. Damn it. She had thought by this age she would be able to control her emotions better, but it seemed like the older she got, the deeper she felt things. He was probably playing with her, but she couldn&rsquo;t understand why he would. They had already had sex, so what else could he possibly hope to gain from her?<br /><br />She heard footsteps coming from outside the door into the restroom so she ducked into the nearest stall. The two girls who entered obviously hadn&rsquo;t come to actually use the bathroom. She could barely recognize them through the small crack in the stall and with her limited knowledge of idols. She did recognize that they were from SNSD and f(x) respectively.<br /><br />&lsquo;So, what was so important that you had to drag me out of practice to talk about?&rsquo; The older girl asked, turning to face the younger girl in front of her.<br /><br />&lsquo;It&rsquo;s that girl again, the bitch! Oppa brought her in today, too. GOD! I swear she is all over him all the time, it makes me sick even looking at her stupid face.&rsquo; Toni couldn&rsquo;t see her, but she could almost hear the pout the girl was doing. She also felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck. This sounded a little&hellip;too familiar.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ya! You know you sound like a brat, right?&rsquo; The younger girl shuffled her feet but didn&rsquo;t say anything. &lsquo;You also know that those are the kinds of girls that Taemin hates the most, right?&rsquo; More silence followed by more shuffling. Toni&rsquo;s heart dropped to her stomach when she heard the name Taemin and realized that the girl with the stupid face they were talking about was most likely her.<br /><br />She must have nodded in agreement because the older girl continued on. &lsquo;Good. Since you know that you definitely shouldn&rsquo;t act like that around him. I know you hate seeing them together, but hey, hasn&rsquo;t Taemin always taken care of you?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah, but he just treats me like a baby. It&rsquo;s frustrating seeing her around him all the time. I&rsquo;ve never seen Oppa be that nice to somebody besides me. He&rsquo;ll get tired of her, I know he will. He&rsquo;s just fascinated because she&rsquo;s American and&hellip;I JUST DON&rsquo;T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SEES IN THAT OLD LADY!&rsquo; She sounded to the point of tears, but Toni took offense at being called an old lady. She bit down on her tongue and closed her eyes, calming herself to keep from busting open the door and confronting them. Fighting with a sixteen year old&hellip;she should be above that by now. Still, it took all her restraint.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, you already said it. He&rsquo;s always come back to you, so why wouldn&rsquo;t he now? Plus, have you seen her? She has nothing on us. I don&rsquo;t know where they get off on thinking they could actually have anything on us. Come on, you&rsquo;ve calmed down a bit now that you&rsquo;ve gotten it off your chest, and they&rsquo;ll be missing us so we should be getting back.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right unnie. She&rsquo;s not very pretty is she?&rsquo; They broke out into laughter and made their way from the bathroom, their giggles trailing after them. Toni waited until they left before slamming open the stall door and accosting the mirror once again. This time her eyes were narrowed and she could see herself visibly shaking. For a split second she wanted to stomp out of the room, go back to Taemin, drag him to a practice room in front of everyone, and have sex right there. This was what people were saying about her?! If they wanted her to back off, they seriously were going about it the wrong way. She wasn&rsquo;t the kind to succumb to being isolated or people talking about her behind her back. That actually had the opposite effect. It made her want to spend even more time with him and show them all that she was more than just a passing fling. Maybe giving the kid a chance wouldn&rsquo;t be such a horrible thing. She smiled at the decision she had finally come to and went back to the practice room. She was surprised by the lack of Taemin, however, so she gathered her things up and decided to head home early.<br /><br />She got a text from him a little later that was simple enough. &lsquo;Sorry. Something came up.&rsquo; She sighed into her pillow when she read that and even though Taemin&rsquo;s face continually swam in front of her eyes, she still had that nagging thought in the back of her mind that maybe she should keep far, far away.<br /><br /> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />&lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; Onew asked, eyeballing the containers that were waiting on the table that he usually sat at during their tutoring session. Toni smiled widely at him, and answered &lsquo;Well, I have no idea how to make Tofu stew, but something I&rsquo;m really good at is fried chicken.&rsquo; At the mention of his favorite foods Onew&rsquo;s head snapped up. Toni knew from the expression on his face that he was so confused about what was happening, how she knew about it, and even why she had done such a thing. She looked like she was about to burst from excitement over her surprise, and his reaction was exactly what she had hoped it would be.<br /><br />&lsquo;How did you---&lsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;You know that you can find out pretty much everything about you guys from searching online, right?&rsquo; He lowered his head, suddenly feeling stupid for not automatically realizing that. Toni burst out in a fit of giggles. &lsquo;You know that there are people who say you&rsquo;re in a relationship with chicken?!?!?!&rsquo; She was almost doubled over in her chair. &lsquo;They make pictures with you and pieces of chicken together, it&rsquo;s the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life!&rsquo;<br /><br />Her laughter made him laugh too. She seemed to take so much joy in the simplest things that he couldn&rsquo;t help but find joy in them too. She finally stopped laughing and went over to where she had left the food.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&hellip;don&rsquo;t really know how to make Korean food, so I could only make the things I&rsquo;m used to eating. Oh! But I did make some rice! I saw online somewhere that they said Koreans don&rsquo;t really feel like it&rsquo;s a complete meal without rice, so I tried my best to make some.&rsquo; She looked both proud and yet worried about how it would taste.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&hellip;.&rsquo; She looked down at the ground in front of her, and Onew knew he was about to be told why he was getting a treat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry about the other night. You were nice enough to take me out and treat me, and then I acted like a complete idiot, of course, because that&rsquo;s just what I do. It&rsquo;s embarrassing, but the whole night after we got to the tent is really fuzzy. If I said or did anything weird, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I know what some of my drinking habits are so if I did anything&hellip;inappropriate, I apologize.&rsquo;<br /><br />Onew was so amazed by how she could switch to polar emotions within the span of seconds. She let everything she was thinking or feeling show on her face and through her actions, and he found that so endearing it made him like her even more.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, if I had known your drinking habits, I would have taken you out a long time before that~&rsquo; he teased. She looked up, ready to apologize again and yet was shocked by how blatant he was in his attraction to her, but she could tell from the look on his face that he was playing with her.<br /><br />&lsquo;Whatever. Just shut up and eat the damn chicken.&rsquo; She fumed.<br /><br />&lsquo;Hey now, is that any way to apologize?&rsquo; He leaned closer to her, staring at her face and making her widen her eyes before he quickly pulled back, opened the containers and sat down to eat. &lsquo;Wahhh!! Looks good!! Who knew you&rsquo;d actually be able to cook?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Why does everyone always say that?&rsquo; She mumbled before taking on a surly expression. She was reminded again of Taemin. He hadn&rsquo;t called her or dropped by since their lesson, and it had been almost a week. He had been skipping his lessons too. She wanted to make excuses for him, saying he was just busy or that something had come up, but it felt like the moment she decided to open her heart to him a bit was the moment he decided to crush it.<br /><br />Onew saw the change in her expression and quite sneakily picked up the pair of chopsticks, and stuck one each into his ears, as if it was the most normal thing in the world, not saying one word to her but continuing to eat his drumstick. Toni laughed out loud when she finally did glance back at him and Onew smiled, glad he was able to do at least this much.<br /><br /> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />The last two weeks seemed like they had flown by and yet went by at a snail&rsquo;s pace. Toni had no idea how it had been two weeks since she had last seen Taemin. She had finally broken down and texted him, asking why he had been missing his lessons and that he would fall behind if he didn&rsquo;t come soon. She didn&rsquo;t want to let him know that she just missed seeing him. Even though he tore her up and made her a nervous wreck from the inside out, she still felt pulled to him. He had still given her the short and simple messages repeating the same vague things: he was busy or something had come up. It wore on her last nerve, and she wanted to be mad at him, but her frustration stemmed from one fact: she missed him. Plain and simple, she missed seeing him. Admitting that to herself made her even angrier at the demon for not being around.<br /><br />She had been more than distracted with work, however, and it had been working to help her not think of Taemin. Those odd jobs she had been told about had come in all it once it seemed. Currently, she was helping with the wardrobe backstage at one of the music shows. It was a lot more bustling than she had expected it to be, and more than a couple of times she had gotten lost in the back and forth deliveries. Fortunately, this let her run into some other Korean idols, and made her a little more open to the idea that Taemin wasn&rsquo;t the only good looking man in Korea. She smiled at herself thinking that after she had nearly run into someone in front of BEAST&rsquo;s dressing room, and blushed a bit at the thought that followed it. That even though there were other good looking men, none of them shone as brightly as Taemin did.<br /><br />She ended up bumbling about again on the way back from the dressing room, and mistakenly entered into one of the rooms that had a door just like the one she was looking for, but wasn&rsquo;t the room she needed. The scene that met her was shocking to say the least. There were two people in the dark room, one of them she recognized to be the maknae from f(x), and the other was too shaded for her to see. What was shocking, however, wasn&rsquo;t that the two were alone in the room. It was Sulli, having her head thrown back holding onto the shoulders of the man in front of her while the man in front of her obviously had his hand under her skirt.<br /><br />Sulli gasped when she spotted her and Toni started to apologize when the man turned his head slightly and she closed her eyes, feeling a knot form in her stomach when she instantly recognized that chiseled jaw and all too familiar profile.<br /><br />She couldn&rsquo;t break down here. Couldn&rsquo;t let him see what had just happened to her. She had to escape, to get as far away from the room, from him, from the scene she had just witnessed, or else she was afraid she would shatter into a thousand pieces and never be able to put herself back together again. She swallowed down the rock in her throat and blinked back the hot tears that wanted to make their way out.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I have the wrong room.&rsquo; She said in one breath. She turned around and practically fled, shutting the door quickly behind her.<br /><br />Sulli breathed out the air she had been holding and started laughing. &lsquo;Well Oppa, I guess the cat is out of the bag. Now she&rsquo;ll finally learn her place.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Shut up.&rsquo; Taemin growled, settling down on the floor and laying his head against the wall behind him, hitting it probably a little harder than he should have.<br /><br />&lsquo;What? Why?&rsquo; She squealed out, confused.<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!</strong>&rsquo; He screamed. Sulli pulled back, his words slapping her across the face. She had never seen him <em>this</em> angry, let alone at her. She didn&rsquo;t bother hiding her disappointment and tears, unlike the woman who had just left. She sat in the corner sniffling before finally she broke into tears.<br /><br />&lsquo;Oppa finally wanted to do this with me, so I thought that maybe you liked Sulli as much as she liked you&hellip;plus that girl isn&rsquo;t even that pretty or anything. Why does it matter?&rsquo; She thought that her tears would calm him down and make him feel guilty about yelling at her, but it only worked to irritate him even more.<br /><br />&lsquo;Sulli, I&rsquo;m going to give you five seconds to get out of here, and if you&rsquo;re not gone&hellip;even I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo; The cold tone of his voice silenced her instantly and sent chills up her spine. She hesitated for a split second, but a glare from him sent her scurrying out of the room.<br /><br />When the door shut, Taemin laid his head against the wall once more. Then he did it again, harder. Then once again, even harder. He wanted to feel the pain of it, so that he could feel even a bit of what he had just seen in Toni&rsquo;s eyes. He covered his face with his hands and sat there, his head replaying what had just happened like a broken movie reel."

It has some bad language in it....*sigh* I'm worried<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Yes....read more....Kiki...TT"">I couldn&rsquo;t force myself out of bed after that for days. The horror scene just kept replaying over and over in my mind. The way Sujin had arched her back and moaned while my dongsaeng thrust wildly inside her&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t escape the images. <br /><br />Even worse than that though, was that sometimes when I remembered I felt my lower body begin to stir, looking for attention. It was great. Everything around me had betrayed me, so why shouldn&rsquo;t my own body too?<br /><br />I wanted to scream into my pillow until I was hoarse, but just as I was about to do so there was a knock on my door. <br /><br />&lsquo;Go away mom. I told you I was sick.&rsquo; Another knock. &lsquo;Mom! I&rsquo;m sick!&rsquo; A third knock. I let out a frustrated groan and angrily got up to answer the door, wondering what made my mom so impatient. I was greeted with a surprise, however, when the person on the other side of the door wasn&rsquo;t my mother, but instead Sujin and Dongwoon. I tried my hardest to hide the look of horror and disgust that wanted to make its way to my face, but it seemed like Dongwoon saw it anyway. He smirked in my direction and seemed to move closer to Sujin, his arm lightly grazing hers.<br /><br />&lsquo;Oppa, are you really sick?&rsquo; Sujin asked, looking worried. She moved her hand to feel my forehead for signs of a fever, and without even realizing it I jerked back from her touch. She stood there shocked, looking like I had just slapped her hand away.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ung.&rsquo; I replied, making my way back into my room and to my bed. I didn&rsquo;t invite them in, but they followed me anyway. <br /><br />The more I looked at them, the more I felt the knot in my stomach tighten. It was sickening. How could they even look me in the face, let alone pretend that nothing had happened? How long had this been going on?? Were they always doing this behind my back? Who started it? How&hellip;how could they do that to me?<br /><br />My head was swimming from all the questions buzzing around inside it, and I suddenly felt dizzy. That added on top of my already knotted stomach made me feel actually sick. I got out of bed and ran from the room, going to the bathroom, needing to escape the room and those monsters so that I could breathe again.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure he&rsquo;s ok.&rsquo; I heard Dongwoon&rsquo;s deep voice follow after me as I made my way down the hallway.<br />I leaned my head back against the bathroom door with a soft thud, taking deep breaths as though I had been smothering. He didn&rsquo;t even bother knocking&hellip;just shoved his way into the bathroom behind me.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ya! What do yo-&lsquo; I started, but was silenced when he grabbed my wrists, pushing my back against the door behind us and pressing his body against mine.<br /><br />&lsquo;I know you saw us the other day, hyung.&rsquo; He whispered, his breath hot on my ear. I gulped, trying to slow my heart down. It was beating too much for the situation I was in.<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah, I did.&rsquo; I admitted, turning my head away from his and trying to fight the tears that threatened to spill out. &lsquo;How could you? I thought you were my friend&hellip;&rsquo;<br /><br />He laughed. It was so cold it gave me chills. <br /><br />&lsquo;I just gave her what you weren&rsquo;t, hyung. Isn&rsquo;t that what friends do? Make sure their girlfriends don&rsquo;t leave them?&rsquo; He grabbed me by my chin, turning my head to where it was facing his and holding it in place there. &lsquo;Besides&hellip;&rsquo; His other hand trailed down my stomach and made it&rsquo;s way under my sweat pants, palming my growing erection. My eyes grew wide with shock at what was happening, and I made to push him off me, but he removed his hand from my face and used it to pin my arms above my head.<br /><br />&lsquo;Did you forget already hyung?&rsquo; I stilled, realizing that he had remembered me all along. He leaned forward and licked my neck before gently biting it, then made his way up to my ear. &lsquo;You belong to me.&rsquo; I shivered from the assertive tone of his voice, and even though my mind said this entire situation was wrong, everything in my body screamed about how right it felt.  <br /><br />&lsquo;That means everything of yours is mine&mdash;including that little bitch.&rsquo; He spat out. He gave my cock a slight squeeze, making a soft moan escape from my lips. He groaned at the sound and pressed himself forward, attacking my lips.<br /><br />I&rsquo;d never been kissed like that before. It was as if I could feel all his desire, his need for me, through his kiss. He attacked my mouth, shoving his tongue inside and fighting my tongue with his. He groaned again, pressing his body further against me and moving his hand against my still hardening erection. <br /><br />He finally caught himself and pulled back with a grunt, biting my lower lip as he did. He released me completely and let me collapse to the ground, my mind and body in too much shock to even begin processing what had just happened. <br /><br />He brought the offending hand up to his mouth, flicking his tongue out to slowly lick the drop of precum he had stolen from his finger.<br />&lsquo;Mmmm.&rsquo; He practically sighed, tasting me. &lsquo;Why does everything on you taste so fucking sweet?? It&rsquo;s addicting.&rsquo; His eyes darkened as he looked down at me clutching my knees to my chin and looking up at him, both worried and excited at what his next move would be. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it for today. But when you want more,&rsquo; he lowered himself down to my level. &lsquo;And believe me, you will want more, just come to me anytime,&rsquo; he said tracing his fingers along my lips. He looked like he didn&rsquo;t want to end there, but he didn&rsquo;t want to force me to do anything I didn&rsquo;t want to do either. With that, he pulled the door open, practically pushing me over from the sudden force, and made his way out. I could hear his footsteps fall down the stairs and could almost feel Sujin&rsquo;s curiosity at why he was leaving without her.<br /><br />I made up my mind right there what I was going to do. I exited the bathroom and went back to my room, locking the door behind me.<br /><br />&lsquo;Oppa, where did Dongwoon-oppa go?&rsquo; She tilted her head in curiosity, and then widened her eyes when she noticed the look on my face. I descended on her where she was sitting on the bed, taking her face between my hands and reenacting the kiss I had just been given in the bathroom. When I closed my eyes it was Dongwoon&rsquo;s face who flashed before them, not Sujin&rsquo;s. He had lit a fire inside me, and I had no idea how to go about putting it out.<br /><br />Sujin broke from our kiss, gasping for breath. &lsquo;Oppa~&rsquo; She moaned, her eyes glazing over, and the scene I had witnessed from the other day played out in my mind once again. I groaned. <br /><br />&lsquo;Sujin, suck it.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;What?&rsquo; She asked, clearly taken aback by my boldness.<br /><br />&lsquo;Mmmm, suck me.&rsquo; Her eyes seemed to light up, as if a switch that had been waiting to be turned on was suddenly flipped. She crawled over to me on the other end of the bed, pulling my pants down slightly and freeing my still hard cock. She looked at it for a moment, taking in the sight for the first time before she leaned forward and kissed the tip, making me lean my head back from the touch.<br /><br />She swallowed me completely and I groaned from the foreign feeling, knotting my hands through her hair. It felt amazing. I closed my eyes as she continued, licking and sucking and everything in between. Dongwoon&rsquo;s face swam before my eyes again&hellip;his expression as he had thrust inside her, the way he groaned when he heard my moans, the look of pleasure that crossed his face as he tasted me&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. <br />I grabbed two fistfuls of Sujin&rsquo;s hair and used it to thrust myself into the back of her throat. She gagged around me, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me. I continued to savagely thrust into her mouth until I felt the muscles in my stomach begin to tighten and knew what was coming next. I shoved myself as far back into her throat as I could and then came, wave after wave spilling forth into her mouth.<br /><br />When it was over I sat back, pulling up my pants and scooting further back onto the bed. Sujin sat there for a moment before she looked up at me, her eyes ablaze. She smacked me on the arm.<br /><br />&lsquo;That was too rough! Damn oppa&hellip;next time at least tell me when you&rsquo;re going to come! I thought I was going to choke to death.&rsquo; She wiped her mouth and got up to look into the mirror and straighten her hair. I couldn&rsquo;t even stand the sight of her at this point. She was too used to this. Too tainted. I didn&rsquo;t even know by who. I didn&rsquo;t want to know. If she could do what she did with Dongwoon, with one of my good friends, who wouldn&rsquo;t she do it with?<br /><br /><br />&lsquo;Are you happy now Sujin?&rsquo; I asked her as flatly as I could. She turned around, finally sensing my mood.<br /><br />&lsquo;What do you mean oppa?&rsquo; Her eyes started to look worried, and I rejoiced a little on the inside, wanting to make her feel as uncomfortable as possible.<br /><br />&lsquo;I mean, isn&rsquo;t this what you wanted all along? Weren&rsquo;t you stringing me along just for this?&rsquo; I accused. I could see the &lsquo;no&rsquo; already forming on her lips when I interrupted. &lsquo;Ah! My bad. You were probably waiting for the real thing. You wanted me to fuck you?&rsquo; She was stunned silent, too taken aback to even bother denying. I got up from where I was sitting and walked over to her, stopping directly in front of her. She looked terrified of what I would do or say next. I surprised her. I leaned forward and gently kissed her on the forehead. <br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m too good for you Sujin. You don&rsquo;t deserve me, and I sure as hell deserve someone a lot better than you, and you know that.&rsquo; She looked at me, her brows furrowing together and tears forming in her eyes, but she didn&rsquo;t say a word. She couldn&rsquo;t. I was right.<br /><br />&lsquo;Now get out. I don&rsquo;t want to see you anymore.&rsquo;<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t ask for an explanation. Maybe inside her she already knew that I knew about her. Once you see the darkness in someone it&rsquo;s impossible to see them in the same light as you did before. She didn&rsquo;t let me see her cry. I&rsquo;ll give her credit for that.<br /><br />Now that that was done, I needed to decide how to make my next move. The one that had been decided 7 years ago, and that had been building up since that day. It scared the hell out of me, but I couldn&rsquo;t wait for it.</lj-cut>"

He just wanted to show me all of a sudden."">&lsquo;Come on, I showed you mine, now let me see yours!&rsquo; The little boy in front of me demanded. My face was already red from what I had just seen. Not like I had asked to see it. He just wanted to show me all of a sudden. He said he saw his brothers and it was a lot bigger and he wanted to know if it was just him.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;um&hellip;I&hellip;uh&hellip;&rsquo; I managed to stammer out.<br /><br />&lsquo;Come on, stop being such a baby,&rsquo; he said, the tone of his voice sounding meaner. He lunged forward suddenly, taking my pants by the waist and pulling them down quickly. I tried to cover up as much as I could with my hands, but it was no use. <br /><br />&lsquo;Wahh&hellip;maybe it really is me!&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t bother to hide his stare. &lsquo;Look! It&rsquo;s getting bigger!&rsquo; He looked up at me and smiled, a glint in his eye. &lsquo;Ya! Lee Kikwang! Do you know what it means when it gets bigger because of somebody?&rsquo;I shook my head furiously, my eyes widening at what my body seemed to know that I didn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;It means you belong to the person who made it happen. Do you understand that, hyung? That means you&rsquo;re mine.&rsquo;<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I flew up out of bed almost like I was possessed. I gasped for breath and made my way to the bathroom to splash a few handfuls of water on my face. The nightmare I had just had was already turning into a fuzzy memory. Still, I knew exactly what it had been about. It was that same replay of the weird adolescent moment when my best friend and I had gotten just a little too close for comfort. At the time, I had no idea what was happening, or what it meant. Even now, I&rsquo;m still not completely sure.<br /><br />I just know that he moved away not too long after that, and for years the same recurring dream of that time would plague my nights. When I looked in the mirror, however, I realized that it&rsquo;d been a long time since I had been woken up in the middle of the night like that. I looked myself over. Both my hair and pajamas were clinging to my skin, the cold sweat made obvious. I looked really pale, and I sighed to myself at the sight, pinching my cheeks to get some kind of color.<br /> <br />I went back into my room to look at the clock on my night table, and noticed that I still had a few hours until time for school.  I hopped in the shower to go ahead and start getting ready, still not able to shake the chills that were clinging to my body from the lingering dream. I put my weight against the wall in front of me and let the water run down my face and body. I didn&rsquo;t know why, but for some reason I couldn&rsquo;t remember his face. No matter how many times I dreamed the same dream, I always knew who he was, but I couldn&rsquo;t see him clearly&hellip;it bothered me.<br /><br />&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br /><br /><br />It was always the same hustle and bustle at school. Everyone trying to make it to their classes before the teachers took attendance, the couples in the hallway trying to get those last few precious moments together, the girls in the bathroom spraying perfume to try to cover up the stench of cigarettes&mdash;it was sickening. The same thing day after day, but I seemed to be the only one that felt like something was off.<br /><br />&lsquo;Kiki!&rsquo; I heard a chirpy voice from behind me call. I recognized it immediately, and couldn&rsquo;t stop the smile that came to my face. Two seconds later I felt small hands cup over my eyes, and heard the inevitable &lsquo;Guess who~~&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Mmmmm&hellip;.Shin-young?&rsquo; I lost my breath from the hard elbow to the ribs that replied to my answer.<br /><br />&lsquo;And just WHO is Shinyoung??&rsquo; Sujin asked, planting herself in front of me and tapping her foot impatiently. She was adorable when she was angry, and nothing made me happier than making her go red in the face and narrow her eyes.<br /><br />&lsquo;Aigoo, you know I&rsquo;m just playing. I knew it was you, silly.&rsquo; I cupped her cheeks in my hands and pushed them together, making her make a silly face.  <br /><br />&lsquo;Oppa~ You shouldn&rsquo;t be so mean!&rsquo; She pulled my hands off her face, but&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;release them once they fell. I felt my face getting red. Even this little bit of touching made my heart pound faster, and made me worry that much more. How long would someone as amazing as Sujin be able to put up with someone as lame as me? <br /><br />I pulled my hands from hers quickly and shot her a glance through the side of my glasses. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re at school Sujin&hellip;we could get in trouble.&rsquo; I looked around quickly to make sure that no one saw, but not long enough to miss Sujin rolling her eyes.<br /><br />&lsquo;You know, sometimes you being so innocent is cute. Other times it just gets damn annoying. I&rsquo;m going to class. I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rsquo; She stormed off in the opposite direction leaving me with my mouth hanging open and that all too familiar knot in my stomach.<br /><br /><br />&lsquo;Class rep.&rsquo; I was addressed as soon as I entered the room. People always seemed to think that because I was shorter and wore big frame glasses, that I was easy to bully. They were right to some degree. It wasn&rsquo;t that I got picked on; I just had no desire to go against them. I hate conflict. I would rather go out of my way and do something I didn&rsquo;t want to instead of put up a fight against it. Thus, I was roped into being the class rep. &lsquo;Take these papers to the office. Make sure they get to the principal and don&rsquo;t come back here until they&rsquo;re in his hands.&rsquo; Asshole. <br /><br />&lsquo;Yes, teacher.&rsquo; I bowed and made my way to the office.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, at least I don&rsquo;t have to be in class.&rsquo; I thought while I waited for the principal to come back from whatever he was out doing. I kept puffing out my cheeks and making funny shapes with my lips in an effort to try to stave away the boredom. I hated just sitting and waiting. I could feel annoyance start to bubble up inside me, and that was when I knew I had to do something to distract myself. No one wanted the perfect student to explode just because he was forced to wait a bit. <br /><br />&lsquo;Student.&rsquo; I heard a harsh voice say from in front of me. My face froze, silly as it may have looked. The principal had arrived, and next to him was someone I had never seen before but recognized instantly. It was that face that had somehow gotten erased from my memory. <br /><br />Even though he had grown up, he still had the same look as when he was a kid. Those eyes were exactly the same. As soon as they were on me, I automatically felt uncomfortable for some reason. I was sure he couldn&rsquo;t recognize me. I had changed a lot since I was a kid. Plus, I had my glasses on. No way he knew who I was&hellip;right?<br /><br />&lsquo;Yes, sir?&rsquo; I finally responded, unfreezing my face and standing to give him a bow. &lsquo;My homeroom teacher wanted me to bring these to you. Excuse me.&rsquo; I bowed again, trying to make a hasty exit and leave that penetrating stare from my past.<br /><br />&lsquo;Wait.&rsquo; I stopped in my tracks, afraid of turning around, already knowing what was going to happen. &lsquo;This is a new student, Son Dongwoon. Show him where his class is.&rsquo;<br /><br />I gulped down my frustration and nodded at the principal. Dongwoon barely looked my way, his disinterest made obvious. Now that I looked at him, really looked at him, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t the boy I remembered from my childhood. This one was so tall, a good head taller than me, with bleach blonde hair and a piercing in his ear. He was slender, with his facial features cut, looking like they had been carved. His eyes stood out the most, however. I couldn&rsquo;t really place them, but they didn&rsquo;t look Korean. There was something about them&hellip;the looked like they had a secret they wanted to tell. They were enchanting.<br /> <br />Just looking at him, I knew he would be a stress on the school, and really couldn&rsquo;t come up with a reason as to why he would be accepted. I motioned for him to follow after me and we left the office.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, let me see your schedule.&rsquo; He handed it to me and I looked at it quickly. &lsquo;Your class is pretty close to mine, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. So, you&rsquo;re a junior?&rsquo; He just nodded, barely taking in his surroundings as we made our way down the hall. Really, what was this guy&rsquo;s problem?<br /><br />&lsquo;Um.&rsquo; He started, hesitantly. I almost stopped walking from the sound of his voice. It was deep and melodic, and suited him perfectly. I don&rsquo;t know why, but hearing it made me get this feeling in my stomach, like something was desperately trying to escape. &lsquo;What kind of clubs are there?&rsquo;<br /><br />I smiled at his question. Ah, so even though he looked like a delinquent, he was still a high school kid.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s about every kind of club you could think about joining. What are you interested in?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not really sure, just want to join something. Are you a member of any clubs, hyung?&rsquo; He asked, looking right at me.&nbsp;What was wrong with me? Why did his voice and smile make my heart beat like it did for Sujin? I shooed away those scary thoughts and answered him.<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m in the film club. There aren&rsquo;t very many members, just me and a few others. If you like movies, you should really think of joining. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun, and we can always use new members.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Mmm.&rsquo; He said in response. &lsquo;Hyung, I&rsquo;m really sorry, and I don&rsquo;t want to be a bother, but would it be alright if I ate lunch with you? I don&rsquo;t know anyone here and I&rsquo;m not the best at making friends. People are usually scared of me.&rsquo; As much as I wanted to tell him no, he looked too sincere and just plain worried. He was still my junior, and that damn protective instinct I&rsquo;ve tried to bury time and time again kicked in.<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll come get you when it&rsquo;s time for lunch. You can meet my girlfriend then. We always eat outside during lunch.&rsquo; He smiled and his entire face brightened, the load now taken off his shoulders. We made it to his class and he turned around, smiled, and gave me a small wave, entering the room. I guess I really shouldn&rsquo;t judge people by their appearance.<br /><br />Lunch time rolled around, and I made good on my promise. <br /><br />&lsquo;Sujin, this is Dongwoon. He&rsquo;s my dongsaeng here. Dongwoon, this is Sujin, my girlfriend. She&rsquo;s in the film club, too.&rsquo; I turned to Sujin. &lsquo;Dongwoon is thinking about joining the club.&rsquo; She smiled at him and made small talk about movies, what their favorites were and what they wanted to see. Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, having a cute dongsaeng to follow me around and act adorable, even if he did look like a gangster who had an attitude problem. <br /><br /><br />We continued on like that for a few weeks. Dongwoon would hang out with Sujin and I during breaks, before school, and after school during our club time. Sujin seemed to mind it after a while, we barely had any alone time as it was, but now it was practically nonexistent. I found myself having to calm her down quite a few times to keep her from telling <br />Dongwoon off about it. He was oblivious, and she was a firecracker. Even though I knew they would explode one day, I was still entertained in thinking about what it would be like when the confrontation finally did happen. It ended up being nothing like I had expected. <br /><br /><br />I got sick one day. It came on me all of a sudden, and I just felt like I couldn&rsquo;t even move from bed. Sujin had been calling and texting all day, complaining about how she didn&rsquo;t want to spend the day with Dongwoon.<br /><br />&lsquo;But Oppa~~&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know why she thought that oppa shit worked on me. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so weird when you&rsquo;re not here. We don&rsquo;t have anything to talk about&hellip;can&rsquo;t you at least come to the club meeting?&rsquo; I could hear the desperation in her voice.<br /><br />&lsquo;Sujin, please, stop being so selfish. I&rsquo;m feeling really sick right now. Other guys get soup brought to them by their girlfriends, but I have to listen to this every ten minutes?&rsquo; I could practically hear the pout that had formed on her lips. I sighed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m hanging up. I&rsquo;ll call you later.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Wait, op-&lsquo; I hung up the phone and sighed again, getting up and beginning to dress. Even though I didn&rsquo;t feel like it, Sujin really was a weakness of mine. Yes, that oppa shit did work on me. She could just be too adorable. I even loved how she could be so selfish, because it made me just want to spoil her.<br /><br />Sniffles and all, I made it to school right around time for club activities to be coming to a close. I tried to make it as fast as I could, but this damn sickness made me feel like everything was in super slow motion. When I rounded the corner to the classroom we held our meetings in, I could hear the sounds from the movie already. &lsquo;Wow, they must have picked something steamy for today.&rsquo; Was what was going through my head as I heard the sounds coming from the classroom, and right before I actually saw what the cause of the sounds was. <br /><br />Looking through the window of the door, I had to blink a few times to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t actually hallucinating from the illness or the medication.<br /><br />I saw Dongwoon sitting on top of the teacher&rsquo;s desk. His shirt was half undone, but what was even more surprising was the girl that was sitting on top of him. It was obvious what was happening, and I started to turn around and leave, figuring that even seeing that much was a huge invasion of privacy.<br /><br />I started to&hellip;.until I heard that familiar &lsquo;Oppa~&rsquo;, except this time it was in the form of a moan, one that not even I had heard. I froze, praying that I was mistaken but terrified to turn around and check. <br /><br />Looking at it closer, a scene that had just been embarrassing was now a nightmare. I recognized that long black hair, and even the way she tilted her head back as he thrust up into her. The voice that left her lips and had told me so many times that she had loved me was now moaning out his name. I didn&rsquo;t want to look any more, didn&rsquo;t want to see the way she rode out his thrusts as if it was the most natural thing in the world, the way he reached up behind her to pull her hair, tilting her head back for him to attack her neck with licks and kisses, the way she wrapped her legs around his hips in an effort to push him even deeper inside her. I wanted to close my eyes, to turn around and run and not look back, but I couldn&rsquo;t tear myself away. I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it. <br /><br />As I stood there fighting with my indecision, Dongwoon suddenly looked up and right at the window, as if sensing I was there. I expected him to look embarrassed, to push her off him and try to stutter out some sort of excuse as to why he was doing what he was doing; instead, he smirked. He smirked then narrowed his gaze, his tongue darting out between his lips before he slowly bit into his lower lip. He snaked his arms around her back, pulling her even closer to him before he began thrusting upwards at an almost frightening pace. She moaned even louder, calling out his name over and over again as she came. His eyes never left mine.<br /><br />I&rsquo;d finally had enough and I pulled myself away from the door, running home as quickly as I could and trying to escape the horror scene I had just witnessed.<br /></lj-cut><br />"

How do you know when the boy next door becomes something more than just the boy next door?<br /><br />&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><lj-cut text=""The boy lying on my bed breathed steadily, his back rising and falling peacefully as he smiled in his sleep.""><div>I shivered a little as I breathed out the cigarette smoke that had been filling my lungs. It was unseasonably cold for Seoul. I turned my back from the balcony scene below me to look through the streaked glass door behind me. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>The boy lying on my bed breathed steadily, his back rising and falling peacefully as he smiled in his sleep. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I took another draw off the cigarette in my hand and laid my head back, closing my eyes. I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this. I should rip the covers off him right now and shove him out my door, telling him to never come back. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I laughed silently to myself at the image of him standing naked in the hallway without the slightest clue of what had happened, and then crushed the cigarette out. I hugged my arms tighter around myself, and decided it was too fucking cold to be outside anymore. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>The warmth from inside my apartment worked to comfort me, and I just wanted to snuggle up in bed next to the boy and lay there having a lazy day. I sighed at my inability to do this, and made my way over to his side of the bed. I sat down softly next to his shoulder and started my attack to wake him up.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I stroked my hand down his back slowly, tracing small circles on the small of his back while I leaned my mouth close to his head. &lsquo;Taemin~&rsquo; I whispered, taking his earlobe to my lips, nibbling gently on it before moving my mouth further down his neck, kissing and softly biting along my way.&nbsp;</div><div><br />No reaction.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>His lack of moans frustrated me, so I looked up, wondering what the problem was. He wasn&rsquo;t asleep after all, and instead he greeted my gaze with an amused look, face breaking into a smile.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>My hand reached out in an effort to smack him for the teasing, but instead he grabbed my wrist with one hand, my waist with the other, and rolled over, pulling me on top of him in the process.    <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I felt him in between my legs, and realized he was already semi-hard. So he had felt what I&rsquo;d been doing to him. I chuckled on the inside. &lsquo;Taemin, we don&rsquo;t have time for it this morning.&rsquo; I said, making sure to grind my hips further into him, eliciting a delicious moan. I made my move to stand up, but he quickly grabbed my hips, firmly holding me in place on top of him.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t just get me all worked up like that and then leave, noona. That&rsquo;s not playing very nice~&rsquo; He moved his hips slowly, rubbing in just the way he knew got me worked up the fastest.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Damn.&rsquo; I sighed, resigning myself to the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t win against this boy. I lowered my head to his and sought out his lips, kissing all around them, but hesitating to actually meet them. He loved kissing. He was an amazing kisser, and I knew that teasing him with it drove him insane. I nibbled on his juicy bottom lip before gently pressing my lips to his. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I kept my lips to his, but refused to let his tongue enter. He grunted his frustration and I felt his hands moving from where they had been resting on my hips. He lowered his hand until he reached my ass, and gave me a firm slap (probably harder than he should have, but for how frustrated I was making him, I could forgive him this once).  I cried out in pain from the sting of the slap, and he took this as his chance, slipping his tongue into my mouth. How could someone who had just woken up taste so sweet?<br />&nbsp;</div><div>It never ceased to amaze me how good he was at kissing. Sometimes I would wonder how many other women had gotten to touch those lips. How many other women had felt the way he tasted and teased you in all the right ways, while his hands roamed over your body, lightly touching the places he knew would make you throw your head back in pleasure?<br />&nbsp;</div><div>He&rsquo;d come a long way since we were kids. He wasn&rsquo;t that beautiful little boy anymore who would always follow me around and hang off my every word. He wasn&rsquo;t the little brat that got jealous of my first boyfriend and tried to show me how adult he was by trying to kiss me, even though he didn&rsquo;t have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. Even when I think back on it now, the way his lips quivered when he awkwardly pressed them to mine, he was too adorable for words. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>When had he turned into this monster, this&hellip;.man that was below me? When had he learned to turn me on with just a touch, or leave me breathless with just a taste of him? <br />&nbsp;</div><div>He must have sensed that I was somewhere else, because before I knew it I had been flipped over onto my back, him hovering above me. &lsquo;Noona,&rsquo; he whispered, his breath hot in my ear. &lsquo;You think too much.&rsquo; I felt his hand slide under my nightie, his beautiful brown eyes never leaving mine. Everywhere he touched felt hot, and I felt myself shivering in anticipation and pleasure. His hand found my breast, fondling it softly before he traced the outline of my nipple, fingers playing and tweaking it until he had me moaning softly with the slightest touch of it. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rsquo; He said, his gaze finally breaking in favor of tilting down his head to steal another kiss and leave me even more breathless. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think about anything else.&rsquo; His lips trailed down my neck, stopping to bite and suck it gently, knowing it was one of my weak spots. &lsquo;It feels good. Just lose yourself in that. He lifted my nightie above my head, tossing it to the side, and fully exposing me for him to do whatever he wanted to. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I still blushed red every time we got to this point. Every insecurity I had about my body was brought to the surface in the face of this gorgeous man. I moved my arms quickly to try to cover myself up even somewhat, but he grabbed my wrists, pinning them to either side of my head. He looked down at me, drinking me in, and giving me that look he had every time that was so full of awe and lust, that I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel beautiful. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Why do you always act so shy?&rsquo; He lowered himself further down my body, taking the previously tortured nipple into his mouth, and using his amazing tongue skills to make me moan out his name. &lsquo;This body has been mine since I was 15.&rsquo; <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I stopped resisting, knowing full well that he was right. We had always been close. Even after he got accepted to be a trainee at SME, he would still come over to my house for dinner with my family sometimes, or he would sneak out of the dorm at nights when he was having trouble sleeping, seeking me out for whatever it was he found in me that made him feel better. There was always a comfortable space with us, that even though I had been the one to teach him how to kiss, he was my best friend, and that was where the line was drawn.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>Everything changed when I was 17. I fell in love. It&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;with Taemin. It was with a senior in my art club. He was smart, and everything I had ever wanted in a guy. He saw me as someone important, not just someone on the sidelines of his life, who would always be there when she was needed, but fade into the background when she wasn&rsquo;t. He loved me back.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>The first time Taemin came over after Jongmin and I started dating, I knew there would be hell to pay. He never texted first when he was coming; He would just show up outside my window in the shadows, feeling bad from whatever hardship had come from being an idol that day.<br /><br />When I heard the familiar tapping on my window, I felt my heart grow heavy, and it took all my strength not to just hide myself under the blankets and pretend I couldn&rsquo;t hear him. Tears readily sprang to my eyes when he tapped out the secret code that we had made up when we were kids. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I hurried to the window, tip toeing so as not to wake up the rest of my sleeping family. I opened the window silently, letting him inside in the way we had done at least a thousand times before. He crawled into my room, and upon standing up gave me a big hug. I heard him release a relieved sigh, and it was as though I could feel all the tension that had been building up inside him since the last time we met just disappear. I felt myself sinking into him, and knew I needed to do what should be done before I was lost. Taemin had the power to always sweep me up in his pace. When I was with him, it seemed like there was no outside world, there was only that moment and doing any and everything I could to bring the smile back to his face.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I gulped down the rock that had formed in my throat and broke from his embrace, shocking him out of his relief, and instantly alerting him that something was up.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Noona?&rsquo; He questioned as I made my way back to my bed. I crawled inside it and snuggled up under the covers, holding a fistful tightly under my chin and trying to calm myself down. If I wanted to let him know I was serious about this, I had to be able to talk to him about it and not just fall to pieces and back down from it. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>He started to follow me over to my bed but suddenly stopped when he was a couple of feet in front of my nightstand. I followed his gaze and saw what had stunned him enough to make him stop dead in his tracks. On the nightstand, where the picture of him and I used to stand, was now a picture of Jongmin and I. We had gone out on a date a few days earlier, and he had surprised me when we went to take a picture by sneaking and giving me a peck on the cheek. That moment was now sitting comfortably on the nightstand next to my head. I bit my lip and lowered my eyes.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I waited for him to show some kind of reaction. I expected him to throw the temper tantrum that he had always been known so well for, screaming and throwing things around the room in the way a child does when one of its toys has been taken away. That&rsquo;s why my entire body froze when I saw what his reaction was. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>He stood there just staring at the picture with his mouth open in a half gasp. I felt my heart shrivel when I saw the silent tear that made its way down his cheek. He didn&rsquo;t say a word. He just stood there, staring in disbelief at the picture as trails of tears zigzagged their escape route down his beautiful face.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>Before my mind could even process what I was doing, I had jumped out of my bed and was at his side, cradling his head in my arms as I repeated a chorus of I&rsquo;m sorrys over and over again. His hands reached up to cling to my arms, and I held onto him while he sobbed like a child. We stayed in that position until his cries resigned to sniffles and he finally pulled out of my embrace. He looked up at me, his eyes shining softly from the tears that he had just been shed, and reached out to touch my face.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Idiot.&rsquo; He said, gently wiping away the tears I hadn&rsquo;t even realized had fallen. &lsquo;Why are you crying? I&rsquo;m the one who just had my heart broken. Crybaby. You need to toughen up if you want to make it in this world.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Speak for yourself,&rsquo; I replied, indignant, expecting his usual witty retort. All I got instead was a sad sigh.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;I just&hellip;never thought you would abandon me. It may have been stupid and childish of me, but I&rsquo;ve never considered a life that didn&rsquo;t have you in it.&rsquo; He brought a hand to his eye, rubbing it roughly to rid himself of the few tears that lingered there and the embarrassing scene he had just let me witness. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m happy for you, and that I&rsquo;ll smile when I see you next time. I just&hellip;can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; He stood up quickly and started making his way back to the window, leaving me on my knees in the middle of the floor.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>It was like ice water had been thrown on me. What did that mean? He couldn&rsquo;t smile when he saw me? When would he smile? I was taking away his smile? Would he want to see me again? What would that make me? I had always been there because he needed someone to help him smile. If I couldn&rsquo;t even do that, then what use would I be to him? <br />&nbsp;</div><div>My mind raced in fear with all these thoughts, and I felt my chest tighten as he went to stride past me. I reached out and grabbed his hand shakingly before he made it by me. &lsquo;Taemin-ah,&rsquo; I whispered hesitantly. I was afraid that once he disappeared through the window, he would disappear from my life. He had debuted, there were hundreds, thousands that could easily and willingly take my place. What was so special about me?<br />&nbsp;</div><div>He looked down at me, his eyes questioning what else could possibly be left to say, so I gathered all my courage and stood up to face him. I stood on my tiptoes, wrapping my arms around his neck, and brought my lips to his. He raised his eyebrows in surprise, but soon enough he had wrapped his arms around my body and melted into the kiss. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>He pushed backwards, leading me to the bed. I let him. When there, as he kissed my body and explored me for the very first time, I looked over to my right and spotted the picture of Jongmin and I. I gulped down all the guilt that built up in my stomach and threatened to spill out, and placed the picture face down. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>After everything was over, I laid there basking in the warmness that was Taemin and the act that we had just committed.   There were so many emotions fighting inside me that all I could do was turn my head to the side and let hot tears flow out to dampen my pillow. Taemin must have felt what was wrong with me, because he pulled me closer to his side, hugging my back tightly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it happened this way, but I&rsquo;m not sorry it happened. You&rsquo;re the only person in this world I can&rsquo;t lose. For me to be able to live, I need you.&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;</div><div>Even if they were all lies, I didn&rsquo;t care. Those were the words I had always wanted to hear from him. I&rsquo;d wanted them since I realized I had feelings for the dorky neighbor kid who was two years younger than me, the boy who was now being loved and adored by so many other nameless, faceless people, the boy who had somehow managed to worm his way into my heart, and now my body. I looked up at the downturned picture again. I&rsquo;m sorry Jongmin. I&rsquo;m so sorry. Taemin is&hellip;Taemin is&hellip;Taemin just is. Taemin is a part of me I&rsquo;m not willing to lose yet. Forgive this selfish awful woman, please? I said my silent prayers to a person who would never hear them, and rolled over to face Taemin, snuggling further into him and nestling my head in the crevice between his neck and shoulder. It would soon become my favorite place in the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;</div><div>That had been three years ago, and now I found myself in that same position. Well, not the literal same position. Right now he had made his way down my body and was hovering between my legs, a hand on either of my thighs, holding them open for him to get a better look.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Mmm, Taemin,&rsquo; I let out, my embarrassment surfacing once again. This time, I covered my face with my hands. He had a way of making me feel so vulnerable, unworthy, and yet stunning at the same time. Just knowing that this wonderful man, who was growing more beautiful day by day, took his time to be with me, and that even after three years he still wanted me, that was a feat in and of itself.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I felt him lower himself further towards me, and he breathed out a content sigh. The warm air went right against me, touching my most sensitive areas, and I almost lost it from that alone. He traced his lips along my thigh, leaving a trail of butterfly kisses along the way. When his tongue finally did press against me, I was a goner.  In no time at all, I had clenched two handfuls of his chestnut colored hair and was holding on for dear life as he gave me the pleasure that only he could. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>After feeling me come so utterly undone against him, he looked up at me and gave me that sexy smirk that I had fallen victim to so many times before. I let out a frustrated moan, making my need for him obvious. I pulled him up to where he was facing me and pressed my lips to his.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>God, how much did I love being able to taste myself on his tongue? It turned me on so much. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I could feel him hard against my thigh, his want to enter me obvious. He needed me just as badly as I needed him. I spread my legs open further and pressed against him in the way that we had so many times before. He pressed forward and finally entered me, leaving me gasping for breath. No matter how many times we did this, it always felt so new and exciting. Just knowing that he was inside of me, that we were now as close as two humans could possibly be, made every time special for me. I grabbed onto his arms and dug my nails in as he pushed himself completely in. I looked up at him, his eyes slightly glazed over from pleasure, and our gazes met. He leaned down and planted a kiss on my lips that was so gentle and inappropriate in this situation that I wasn&rsquo;t sure it had even happened. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>He pulled out and harshly thrust back in, starting his ravaging of my body. I don&rsquo;t know when it had happened, but at some point we had gone from being sweet and gentle to using sex to work out our frustrations with each other.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>Not that I had a problem with this. Not that I was able to think anything at all when he was inside me. He knew what I wanted, what I needed, even before I did. He flipped me over so I was on my stomach, and grabbed my hips, pulling me even closer to him. He ran his hand through my hair before clutching a fistful and using it to pull himself even deeper inside of me. I let out an involuntary yelp and he released his grip in favor of running his nails down my back before giving my ass another hard slap. God, he knew exactly what I liked. I had never told him, but I was terrified that if I didn&rsquo;t feel a bit of pain, I would lose my mind from the pleasure of having him inside me, never being able recover. My back arched from the feel of his nails, and he used that as his chance to pull me against him, pressing my back against his chest. He tilted my head towards him, kissing me on the lips quickly before making his way down my neck and back, then pushing me down into the pillows once more. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>This time he showed no mercy, knowing that both of us were close. He pushed further, his pace quickening and his thrusts deeper. It&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;long at that pace before we both reached our climaxes, our gasps and moans mingling together to make a sweet sound that I wanted to live off of forever. Believe it or not, it was always like that. We always came at the same time. I don&rsquo;t know if it was because he would hold off until he could feel me tighten around him and he knew that I was almost there, or if it was because our bodies were just so in tune to each other that there wasn&rsquo;t a need for one to continue when the other was through. Whatever the reason was, we always ended up lying next to each other, gasping for breath in the after effect of our love making, sighing with a thin layer of sweat covering us both. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I closed my eyes to try to catch my breath and felt him stir next to me. He moved down my side and I felt his lips at my hip bone.<br />&lsquo;Taemin, I really don- AH!&rsquo; My words were cut short when I felt his teeth sink into me. It didn&rsquo;t hurt; in fact it felt so delicious I almost got worked up again. All too soon, he had pulled back though, admiring his work. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;There,&rsquo; he smirked, completely satisfied when he saw the mark he had just made. &lsquo;Now you can&rsquo;t let anyone else see you for a while~&rsquo; His eyes glistened with mischief until he felt my hand come up and give him a gentle tap on the head. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;YA! Brat! I told you not to do that. Damn!&rsquo; I faked annoyance. I made my way out of the bed, knowing if I didn&rsquo;t use this as my chance to leave he would keep me in bed all day, and I couldn&rsquo;t do that today. I went to the bathroom and started cleaning myself up, rushing to try to get it done before he lured me back into his arms. I knew what he was worried about, and why he would do it, but he really didn&rsquo;t have to be worried. I hadn&rsquo;t told him, but he was the only man I had ever been with. He was the only man who knew all the curves of my body, and the only man that I trusted enough to know everything about me. I liked him not knowing. I was afraid that if he knew, really knew, just how much power he had over me, I would never be able to free myself from his grasp.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>He soon followed me into the bathroom, looking like a puppy that had just been scolded. How could I stay angry at him? Being in the spotlight all the time had taught him the tricks he needed to know for winning a girls heart. I melted every time.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Are you still mad?&rsquo; He asked, eyes lowered as he leaned against the door post. I walked over to him and stood on my tip toes, giving him a small peck on the lips in a sign of forgiveness. He smiled and pulled me closer to him. &lsquo;Noona~~ I lov-&lsquo; I broke his words by pressing my lips harder against his and silencing his tongue with mine.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I couldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t let myself hear those words and give my heart even a slight bit of hope that he could be mine. I just knew&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take it if I ever set my whole heart on him and he ended up breaking it. That&rsquo;s exactly what would happen. He was Taemin. He was everyone&rsquo;s Taemin, the adorable maknae of SHINee, property of Shawols, and didn&rsquo;t have room in his heart or his life for anything but his career. I knew this. I knew it with everything in me, but I was still afraid that hearing him say those words would put a crack in the wall I had built up around my heart, and that a slight bud of hope would start growing there. I couldn&rsquo;t allow myself to hope for something I could never really have.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I broke from our kiss and went about getting dressed. Taemin pulled on his boxers and laid down on the bed, sulking. I know it&rsquo;s because I wouldn&rsquo;t let him say what he&rsquo;s tried so many times to say before, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything to be done. He would just have to sulk on this subject because I wasn&rsquo;t budging in my position.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I put the finishing touches on my hair and dabbed a couple of sprays of perfume along my neck and wrists.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;You look pretty noona. Hot date?&rsquo; He questioned, rolling onto his side to get a better look at me.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Yeah, as a matter of fact. Jongmin is taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he wants to celebrate something but he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me what.&nbsp;</div><div>Do you know?&rsquo; He shook his head.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;I had a date with him yesterday too but he didn&rsquo;t say anything to me.&rsquo; He smiled, shaking his head.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Date?&rsquo; I tilted my head, looking at him.<br /><br />He laughed. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;We played basketball yesterday. Hyung&rsquo;s really good. He even beat me.&rsquo; His eyes narrowed for a moment before he took on that carefree look again. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>After what had happened three years ago, when we had slept together for the first time, I had had every intention of breaking things off with Jongmin. Every intention. But when I met up with him, and saw the way he looked at me, the way his voice sounded when he talked to me, the way his feelings for me were written in his every action towards me, I couldn&rsquo;t do it. I liked the feeling, I&rsquo;ll admit it. I loved knowing that he loved me, only me, and that I was the only one in his eyes.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>Taemin wasn&rsquo;t surprised when he found out I was still seeing Jongmin. It was as though he hadn&rsquo;t expected anything different, that he was happy with the current arrangement. Jongmin got all the bad and crazy parts, and he got to have all the fun with no strings. He surprised me, however, by asking to meet Jongmin. Of course I refused. Was I that crazy to let the man I&rsquo;m seeing meet the boy I&rsquo;m cheating on him with? Apparently. I didn&rsquo;t even mean to, but Taemin followed me one day when I went to meet Jongmin, and I had no choice but to introduce the two men in my life to each other. Surprisingly, they took to each other and became fast friends. It was such a laughable situation. Jongmin didn&rsquo;t know that Taemin would sneak over on his nights off and then creep out in the morning like a thief, taking something that clearly wasn&rsquo;t his. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>We were sick, and so incredibly unfair to Jongmin. I knew I should break it off&hellip;end it with one of them, but they both felt like a part of myself, and I was terrified of what I would become if I lost either part&mdash;the raw animal lust and need inside me that made me so willing to debase myself and become someone I would be ashamed for my parents to see, and then the sane part of myself, the part that I could show to the outside world and be proud of, the part that knew this kind of relationship couldn&rsquo;t last forever and I needed something to fall back on when it was over. I needed both parts to be me.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;You probably shouldn&rsquo;t be here tonight when I get back, Taemin.&rsquo; I told him. Even though nothing ever did happen, I hated him having all the control. I didn&rsquo;t want to let him know that he was the one who really owned me-- that his mark was the only one I would let on my body.<br />He laid back down on the bed and put his arm over his eyes. &lsquo;I know, I know. Wouldn&rsquo;t want <em>Jonggie</em> to see your darkest secret.&rsquo; He spit out. His words stung a little, but what could I say? He was right.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Just&hellip;.I&rsquo;ll call you when I can.&rsquo; I told him, making my way out the door. He grunted a reply but still laid there, not jumping up and giving me his usual cheery goodbye kiss or chirping about how he couldn&rsquo;t wait to see me next time. It was unsettling, but in this situation he was allowed to sulk too. I sighed and left the building, wishing as always that it could be just him.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />&nbsp;</div><div><br />I know that she likes it a little rough. I think it&rsquo;s because it helps her feel a little less guilty about cheating on Jongmin. All I know is when I slide up into her and slap just a bit harder than I should, her moans get louder and I can feel her whole body tense around me. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>A lot of times I wonder how I ended up in this situation. How did the girl next door that was so sweet and innocent, the one that I had always been in love with, end up trapping me in this kind of situation? I never thought that she would be the kind of person who would be able to string someone along, but God help me it made me love her even more knowing that she had flaws too. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>When I look down at her after we finish and I finally have to leave her warmth, all I can think about is the next time I&rsquo;ll be allowed to see her, the next time she&rsquo;ll be in my arms, the next time that I can touch her and feel her skin against mine.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I know she holds it against me that I&rsquo;m an idol and in the spotlight, but really, she&rsquo;s the only person who knows the true me. All those other girls, they see what I want them to see. She sees all my darkest, most bare parts, and yet she still wants to be with me. It&rsquo;s amazing. She&rsquo;s amazing, and how she&rsquo;s been able to lower herself to this level for someone like me makes me feel both honored and ashamed. I hate that I&rsquo;m making her be this person. I hate myself for that.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>While she dresses, this is usually what would be going through my mind. How on earth I could sully such an angel, but enjoy every minute of it. I wanted to be the only one to dirty her, and knowing that I wasn&rsquo;t drove me absolutely insane to the point of wanting to punch walls and break things. Every time I thought about her and Jongmin hyung together, my chest would constrict and a knot would form in my stomach. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>She was the one who decided on what this relationship would be. If it were up to me, I would tell her I love her 1000 times a day. If it were up to me, I would go solo at 24 and announce my impending marriage to her at 25. If it were up to me&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t have to share her. She doesn&rsquo;t know it, but she&rsquo;s the only woman I&rsquo;ve ever had.  Everything I know about women, I learned from her, and she&rsquo;s the only one that&rsquo;s ever been in my life. She teases me about girls sneaking backstage, and I let her go on thinking what she will, because really, how pathetic is it for a guy to be so under a woman&rsquo;s spell that he doesn&rsquo;t even notice other women?<br />&nbsp;</div><div>She always dresses up when she goes out to see Jongmin, spraying the sweet perfume he bought her for their anniversary. I remember because I had planned on buying her the same thing for her birthday. Jongmin beat me to the punch. He always does. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I bite down hard on my lip to keep from screaming at her. Why am I not enough for her? Why does she have to go run to some other man&rsquo;s arms? Why is he allowed to walk around with her in public, to introduce her as his girlfriend to people? Why am I stuck in this dark room, only getting to see her on stolen time?<br />&nbsp;</div><div>I decided when she told me she wasn&rsquo;t breaking up with Jongmin that I had to meet him. I needed to know who this person was that was so much better than me. I wasn&rsquo;t impressed. He was boring. And not that he was ugly, but I mean really, I&rsquo;m Lee fucking Taemin. But he was going to be a part of her life, and I wanted to see all sides of her, even this one.<br />&nbsp;</div><div>Which is why I keep up my &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; with Jong. I lay back down on the bed and cover my eyes, that damn perfume filling my nostrils. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>&lsquo;Just&hellip;.I&rsquo;ll call you when I can.&rsquo; She tells me, making her excuse to leave. I grunt my response. I hear the door open and close, and I thank god she is so insensitive at that moment. I thank God she didn&rsquo;t come over and ask what was wrong. I thank God she didn&rsquo;t see the stupid fucking tear that forced it&rsquo;s way out of my eye. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>Truthfully, I knew why Jongmin wanted to meet her. He told me yesterday when we went out to play. I helped him pick out the fucking ring. <br />&nbsp;</div><div>I let myself break down right there. It&rsquo;s her move from here. I&rsquo;m crumbling from the inside out, however. Her choice has always been made obvious, so why should this time be any different?</div></lj-cut><div>&nbsp;</div></div>"

"event","Title: The Rhythm<br /><br />Chapter: 8<br /><br />Rating: PG<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""He never wanted to let go of that scent."">The rest of Toni&rsquo;s week passed peacefully, and she finally had her lessons with the other SHINee members. They went by relatively uneventful. She learned that Key loved to gossip and Jonghyun thought he was the shit. Each member had something about them that made the lesson memorable and fun.<br /><br />The day finally arrived that she had promised to go to dinner with Onew.  Even though she didn&rsquo;t want to, she couldn&rsquo;t help but primp for it as if she had someone to impress. She put on the new dress she had bought (not for the occasion of course, that was merely coincidental), straightened her hair to the point that it was smooth and silky (which never happened because it was generally a frizzy mess), perfected her make-up, and made sure she smelled her sweetest. <br /><br /> Even she didn&rsquo;t know why she was going through so much trouble. Maybe it was something like she could meet her soulmate on the way to the store and she wanted to look her best, or maybe it was because whenever she thought about Onew now, she could feel her heartbeat quicken and remember how nice she had felt being wrapped in his arms. She hadn&rsquo;t had an honest to goodness kiss in a long time. Sure, she had kissed Taemin on that infamous night, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same as when she had kissed Onew. Taemin&rsquo;s kiss had been one of raw passion&hellip;not to say that Taemin wasn&rsquo;t a good kisser. Nothing like that. It was just&hellip;you could tell. Onew knew exactly what he was doing, and it was made painfully obvious.<br /><br />&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just dinner to make up for being such an asshole before,&rsquo; she told herself.<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah, but-&lsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;No buts!&rsquo; Her inner Hitler screamed at her. Toni shook her head. <br />Since she had moved to Korea she had been having inner arguments a lot more often, probably because she didn&rsquo;t have any close friends there, but she needed to break the habit. It wasn&rsquo;t normal.<br /><br />Toni sighed and headed out the door, waving goodbye to her growing collection of honeysuckles next to the door. It never failed that every morning there would be one waiting at her doorway. It made her day a little brighter and always made her think of Taemin. She still didn&rsquo;t know what she was going to do about him because she wasn&rsquo;t completely sure how she felt about him. She seemed to have forgotten the fact that he was seventeen.<br /><br />Toni left her apartment a little early because she found out it was even easier for her to her lost in Korea than it was back home.  Usually she didn&rsquo;t worry about it, since she actually liked just wondering around and finding amazing spots she never would have given a second look if she hadn&rsquo;t gotten lost in the first place.<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t have time for leisurely strolling and window shopping today, however, but of course she still managed to lose her way on one of the streets. She regretted her decision to not call a cab and let them take her straight to the restaurant.  Damn her determination to overcome any weakness she had.<br /><br />She hated having to do it, but she got out her cellphone to call Onew for help. She could almost hear his smile through the phone as he tried to keep himself from laughing. She felt some of that rage and annoyance at him bubbling up. She stopped it with the image of him apologizing so sincerely and then doing something silly like writing his number with pen and paper when every other person in the civilized world would have just told her the number while she put it in her phone. For those silly things she could forgive him for laughing at her.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br /><br /><br />When Onew pulled up at the place Toni had told him she was, he was stunned into silence. He had come there with every intention of teasing her for being such a dunce, but upon seeing her that became the last thing he would even consider doing. She was wearing a floral print dress, but not the kind you normally think of when you hear floral. This dress was anything but the dowdy kind he usually saw the women in his family wear (the older women being the only ones he had seen even bother to wear a floral print dress). It was a gorgeous mid-thigh length white dress, with tiny pink flowers and green leaves all over it. It was cinched at the waist, showing off her dynamite figure, and the straps were off the shoulder, laying gently on her arms and meeting in the center to form a sweetheart neckline that showed off how beautiful her neck and collarbone were. It was the first time he had seen her hair straightened, the long caramel colored locks blowing softly around her face. She had pulled it back, pinning a strand from each side down. Her make-up was immaculate, and the outfit was made complete by a pair of mint green flats that brought out the tones in the dress. <br /><br />&lsquo;She&rsquo;s perfect.&rsquo; Was the only thing Onew could think. Until that very moment, he had decided that he was going to be just friends with Toni. Until that very moment, he had decided she wasn&rsquo;t worth it, and that whoever she decided to date or screw was her business. Until that very moment, he wasn&rsquo;t serious. Things got real the moment he pulled up next to her and she smiled warmly at him, with the wind making her hair and skirt slightly billow out. <br /><br />If there was anyone else on the street, he didn&rsquo;t see them. It seemed like all passing eyes were on her. She just stood there waiting for him to pull the rest of the way up, completely oblivious. Did she really not know how beautiful she was?<br /><br />&lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; She exclaimed once she got inside. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so so so so sorry!&rsquo; She lowered her eyes, clearly embarrassed at getting so desperately lost. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine if I&rsquo;ve been to the place before, but when it&rsquo;s a place I&rsquo;ve never been before, it usually takes me a while or help from someone to find it.&rsquo;<br /><br />Onew just sat there in silence. Was he angry? The longer the silence continued, the more awkward she felt. He must be annoyed that he had to go so far out of his way to pick up a grown ass woman who got lost like a child. She didn&rsquo;t know that he was having an inner freak out, afraid he would say something stupid or do something to make her hate him again.<br /><br />A few more painfully long minutes passed. Toni had had enough. She turned to him, her temper flaring up suddenly. &lsquo;Are you mad or something? I said I was sorry, isn&rsquo;t that enough?! Gosh. Next time I&rsquo;ll just call a freaking cab instead.&rsquo; The last bit was mumbled under her breath, but still loud enough for him to hear.<br /><br />&lsquo;That&rsquo;s not it!&rsquo; He said hastily.<br /><br />&lsquo;Then what is it?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;I was just&hellip;surprised. I didn&rsquo;t expect to see you looking like that&hellip;I thought it would just be the same Toni I had been seeing, but you look really different. I was just surprised.&rsquo; He repeated.<br /><br />She was taken aback by his outburst. She didn&rsquo;t know whether she should be flattered or offended.<br /><br />&lsquo;Is&hellip;that a good thing?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Yes. Not many people surprise me.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m jealous.&rsquo; She said, turning from him in favor of looking out the window. &lsquo;They always shock the hell out of me.' Onew didn&rsquo;t know who was the cause of the sigh that followed those words, but he felt a small prick in his chest from knowing he wasn&rsquo;t the one she was seeing as she gazed out into space. <br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br /><br /><br />The restaurant was as nice as she thought it might be, and she was glad she had put in the extra effort. Everyone turned to look when they entered, and that&rsquo;s when reality hit her. Onew was a mega star, internationally known, and it wasn&rsquo;t okay for him to be seen out on the town with just anyone. There was sure to be talk.<br /><br />Onew noticed how his partner had started fidgeting and he could feel her discomfort. He placed his hand on her forearm in a sign of reassurance. He expected her to jump back in shock from the sudden touch, but instead she looked relieved. <br /><br />&lsquo;I know the owner here. They&rsquo;re used to dealing with celebrities, so don&rsquo;t worry about it. I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to make you uncomfortable.&rsquo; He told her, as if reading her mind. She smiled back at him and nodded, but didn&rsquo;t say anything. While she had convinced herself this wasn&rsquo;t a date, she knew that was what it must have looked like to an outsider. For the briefest moment, Taemin flashed through her mind. Toni had never been bothered by what people thought of her, but this was a different situation entirely. One wrong step with this man and lives could seriously be affected. It was frightening.<br /><br />But&hellip;she was already dressed and out, so they would just have to deal. She shrugged off her inhibitions and decided that she would have fun no matter what.<br /><br />They didn&rsquo;t have to wait long before they were taken to their table, a very private booth in the back away from prying eyes. Toni got embarrassingly excited when the menu was brought. Names of foods she had only ever seen on shows before were suddenly laid out in front of her. She squealed her excitement when she got to what seemed to be a staple in Korea: soju.<br /><br />Onew couldn&rsquo;t hold himself back anymore and he finally burst out laughing. &lsquo;You can get whatever you want. I&rsquo;m treating you remember? Plus, you warned me already so I brought my wallet.&rsquo;<br /><br />She shot him that smile again and shook her head. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think a place this nice is right for me to have my first bottle of soju.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;FIRST?!&rsquo; Onew gasped, nearly unhinging his jaw from surprise.<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah. I never had anyone to go with me, so I just never went. I wasn&rsquo;t lying when I said this was my first time eating Korean food. I&rsquo;ve been living off ramen and what I can microwave since I got here.&rsquo;<br /><br />Onew&rsquo;s eyes remained opened wide, and he stood up suddenly.<br /><br />&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; She asked, a confused look on her face.<br /><br />&lsquo;I want your first taste of Korea to be the real Korea. Come on.&rsquo; He grabbed her hand, leading her out of the restaurant and down the street. They stopped at a small shop on the corner. &lsquo;Wait here,&rsquo; he told her entering the store. He picked out a few things and quickly bought them. When he came out, he was in full on disguise mode. He&rsquo;d bought a beanie and the typical celebrity mask, and was ready to take a scenic walk.<br /><br />Toni burst out in laughter when she saw his appearance. She laughed to the point of tears before finally composing herself. Onew stood there, the part of his face that was still visible growing redder and redder by the second.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; she gasped, clutching her sides that had begun to ache. &lsquo;Oh God. Is this real life?&rsquo; She took a deep breath and finally finished laughing. &lsquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s just like something I would read in a manga or see in a drama. The whole thing is so surreal.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, this is real life for me. If I want to go out for a drink with a friend, this is what I have to do.&rsquo; His words were sharp with a bitter edge to them. She had never really thought about it before. It must feel like being a prisoner in a bigger cell, or an animal on display.<br /><br />&lsquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m sorry. It must suck. Still taking me where we were going?&rsquo; She flashed him her sweetest smile, making certain he couldn&rsquo;t stay upset.<br /><br />&lsquo;Yeah, I guess. It&rsquo;s just a couple of blocks down. Are you alright with walking?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Sure. I wore the perfect shoes for walking and I could use the exercise. Just make sure not to let me fall too far behind. You know I get lost too easily. Plus, if something catches my eye on the way I have a tendency to just wander off&hellip;&rsquo; She bit her lip, hating that she had to lay her flaws bare.<br /><br />&lsquo;Right. That&rsquo;s a problem that&rsquo;s easy to fix.&rsquo; He told her, reaching out his hand. She looked at it as if it were something poisonous. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you. Don&rsquo;t think anything of it. I&rsquo;m not trying to get in your pants; I just don&rsquo;t want to get separated.&rsquo; He continued holding his hand out for her until she hesitantly took it, flustered by how he seemed able to read her mind. <br /><br />When their hands clasped, she felt a warmth travel from her fingertips to the tips of her toes. Toni got confused by that. Onew had been the bane of her existence and now suddenly he could make her heart race? What was this? What about Taemin? Was she really this fickle? Was this the kind of woman she was?<br /><br />Toni felt a pang of guilt towards Taemin and she didn&rsquo;t know why. She wasn&rsquo;t with him, this wasn&rsquo;t a date, and he was a child while she was an adult. She could do what she wanted. But still&hellip;he kept lingering in the back of her mind.<br /><br />She looked up from her thoughts and finally realized where they were going. Her breath caught, and she felt the same excitement she had felt when she first set foot in Korea.<br /><br />It was plain, just one of the outdoor food booths. A tent was set up and tables with plastic chairs were placed inside it. It was the scene she had always imagined when she thought of Korea: settling underneath the tarp with a drinking buddy and plates of kimchi, ricecakes, and soju sitting around her. If this really were a manga, her feet would have been over her head because she had fainted from happiness.<br /><br />This wasn&rsquo;t a manga, however, so the only thing that gave away her excitement was how tightly she suddenly squeezed Onew&rsquo;s hand. She couldn&rsquo;t see it because of the mask he was wearing, but he was beaming. So this was the kind of girl she was. It wasn&rsquo;t an expensive restaurant that impressed her, but a place that was generally known for drunken visits past midnight or school children spending their pocket money. He loved piecing her together with every bit he found out.<br /><br />They took seats opposite each other and the very first thing Onew did was yell &lsquo;Ahjumma, one bottle of soju please!&rsquo; Toni&rsquo;s eyes lit up. &lsquo;Are you sure you can handle this?&rsquo; Onew asked, turning back to face her.<br /><br />&lsquo;I can handle my liquor thank you very much!&rsquo; She couldn&rsquo;t. She was a lightweight who liked to think she wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;the worst kind of drunk. Onew ordered some side dishes and sat down to enjoy the show. Toni had seen him drunk, but he had never seen her to that point.<br /><br />Around shot number three was when he could tell it was affecting her. That was about the time that her speech became slurred and her eyes glazed over. She got really giggly and extremely talkative. Onew, on the other hand, was still stone cold sober after shot three. Unlike her, he actually could hold his liquor.<br /><br />&lsquo;YA! Are you listening to me?&rsquo; She leaned over the table and grabbed his chin, turning his face to hers.<br /><br />&lsquo;Aish! I&rsquo;m listening, I&rsquo;m listening. You were going on and on about this good guy friend you had in high school.&rsquo; Anyone passing by with a curious ear could hear the exhaustion in his voice, but Toni was just glad he had been listening.<br /><br />&lsquo;And we get another shot for that one!&rsquo; She giggled, filling her glass and gulping it down before Onew could stop her. <br /><br />&lsquo;Kaaaaaaa.&rsquo; She said after finishing her drink. &lsquo;I saw that in a show once and always wanted to try it. I&rsquo;m so glad I came out with you! I was really torn about whether I should or not, ya know, since you&rsquo;ve been the biggest possible dick in the world to me. But ya know, you&rsquo;re not so bad after all.&rsquo; Toni completely forgot that she should be speaking in Korean, and when she drank her accent became a lot thicker. At this point, Onew understood about &frac14; of what she was saying.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew, are you listening?!&rsquo; She practically screamed. Onew noticed that some of the people around them had started looking&mdash;a few of them chuckling here and there. <br /><br />&lsquo;Toni, you can call me Jinki.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Why would I do that?&rsquo; She asked, wondering where this had come from. Onew was stunned. He was used to people just knowing things about him, so meeting someone, especially a girl in the industry, who didn&rsquo;t know even his real name was something foreign to him.<br /><br />&lsquo;&hellip;because it&rsquo;s my real name. Only my friends and family get to call me that, so you should feel lucky.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Jinki&hellip;.Jinki&hellip;.&rsquo; He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel happy. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna. If it&rsquo;s such a big deal, I want to keep it like that. How about this? I&rsquo;ll call you Jinki, but only when you&rsquo;ve done something really good or really bad. Okay?&rsquo; She had turned serious.<br /><br />&lsquo;I guess that&rsquo;ll work.&rsquo; He was disappointed but a little excited. This meant that it would be slightly easier to figure out what she was thinking.<br /><br />&lsquo;Aigoo&hellip;&rsquo; She suddenly laid her head on the table. &lsquo;Onew, I like soju.&rsquo;<br /><br />He had to laugh. He had thought for a second there that something might be wrong. His worry proved to be for nothing. This woman was so interesting.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew, I think it&rsquo;s time for me to go home. What do I do? I don&rsquo;t think I remember the way&hellip;&rsquo; In the face of this sudden dilemma she looked to be almost at the point of tears.<br /><br />&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll make sure you get home alright.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ve been drinking too! You can&rsquo;t drive! Don&rsquo;t be a goose!&rsquo;<br /><br />He chuckled. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;ve already called for a cab.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Really?!&rsquo; He nodded. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re my hero!&rsquo; She jumped up from her side of the table and went next to him, giving him a huge hug and laying her head down on his shoulder. That was another bad drinking habit of hers: she didn&rsquo;t know personal space. Onew wasn&rsquo;t complaining.<br /><br />They sat like that until the cab got there then they pretty much just relocated to the cab. Toni was in that state of drunkenness where she needed someone to help support her weight, her eyes now heavy lidded and mumbling whatever random thought popped into her head.<br /><br />&lsquo;Want to know a secret?&rsquo; She whispered into his ear during the ride. He looked at her and nodded, leaning closer to her lips so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to strain to pull herself up to his head.<br /><br />&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Onew, but I snuck shots when he wasn&rsquo;t looking~&rsquo; That would explain why she was falling down drunk from four shots. She shrieked out in laughter. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s funny because YOU&rsquo;RE Onew!!&rsquo; She clapped her hands in a fit of giggles. &lsquo;Oh, that was fun.&rsquo; She settled back down on his chest and he wrapped his arm around her like it was the most natural thing in the world. She snuggled up to him, inhaling his scent. He smelled wonderful, like a mixture of soap and the way fresh flowers smelled after a rainfall. She felt herself falling into it, and before she realized it they were at her apartment building. <br /><br />Onew practically carried her into the building. They reached her apartment and he knew that her trying to unlock the door was a lost cause, so he did that too. When they entered the apartment, they were met with the vase full of honeysuckles.<br /><br />&lsquo;Those are pretty.&rsquo; Onew commented. Toni looked around for a moment, trying to figure out what he was talking about.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ah! The flowers! Yeah, they&rsquo;re from a secret admirer. I think I know who it is though. A little boy who&rsquo;s trying to fit into shoes that are too big for him. He can&rsquo;t handle me....it&rsquo;s nice though.&rsquo; She stumbled her way to the flowers, as if they both didn&rsquo;t know who she was referring to. &lsquo;These are almost like the ones we have back in Kentucky. It makes me think of home. I miss it.&rsquo; She zoned out, gently holding one of the buds between her fingers. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed. If I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll just be an emo kid, and no one wants that.&rsquo; She started to make her way to the bedroom but tripped over her feet. Onew caught her in the knick of time and decided he&rsquo;d better help her there as well.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m fine,&rsquo; she told him, pushing him off her once they got to the bedroom. She went to the closet, turning her back to him and yanking her dress off above her head. Onew saw what she was doing, blushed, and averted his eyes. &lsquo;<em>What&rsquo;s this Onew? Since when are you so shy? Isn&rsquo;t this what you wanted all along</em>?&rsquo; He scolded himself. While he was struggling inwardly, Toni put on a small nightgown and sauntered over to him.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew-ssi~&rsquo; She planted herself in front of him. &lsquo;You know that you&rsquo;re an amazing kisser, right? What are you going to do? Are you sure you can make it home alright? Would it be better if you stayed here?&rsquo; She looked up at him, batting her eyelashes invitingly. Just seeing her in that nightgown tested his self control, but he couldn&rsquo;t, not like this. <br /><br />&lsquo;Toni, I think you should head on to bed. It&rsquo;s been a long day and you&rsquo;re drunk. You don&rsquo;t really want to do this&hellip;&rsquo; He pushed her arms off him, kicking himself all the while. She looked up with fire in her eyes.<br /><br />&lsquo;Fine. Just go home then.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Toni, I-&lsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;<em>Jink</em><em>i</em>, you need to leave.&rsquo; She turned around and went over to her bed, getting into it and pulling the covers over her head.<br /><br />&lsquo;Toni&hellip;I had a really good time with you tonight. I&rsquo;ll text you once you sober up. Goodnight.&rsquo; He closed the door and once on the other side of it, he cursed himself for being such a gentleman. The whole way home he thought of her eyes looking up at him, so tempting and so beautiful. He could still smell her on him and he loved that. He never wanted to let go of that scent. </lj-cut>"

"event","&nbsp;Title: The Rhythm<br /><br />Chapter: 7<br /><br />Rating: PG<br /><br />Warning: This is just half of what I have written, so do not think it's short...I've just been typing for over an hour and I'm tired =_= I'll finish typing up the rest today and post it up, maybe as chapter 8? XDDD<br /><br />Note: Words in <strong>bold</strong> are spoken in <strong>English</strong> (unless I forget to put them in Bold, but you get the picture) and <em>italicized</em> words are <em>thoughts</em>.<br /><lj-cut text=""The truth was that she was still shaken up from the mistake that she had almost let herself repeat yesterday...""><br />&lsquo;Are you alright?&rsquo; Minho asked Toni for what had to be the twentieth time. She gave him a small smile and reassured him again that she was just a tired mess from the long flight and trying to settle in. She lied.<br /><br />The truth was that she was still shaken up from the mistake that she had almost let herself repeat yesterday. She shook her head quickly, trying to disperse the thoughts that were buzzing around in her head like a swarm of hornets. She could still feel Taemin&rsquo;s warm breath on her face, his plump lips against hers, and the way her head was still spinning from his kiss. <br /><br />Minho could tell she was upset, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure what he could do for his newfound friend. Suddenly, he remembered their conversation from the plane ride.<br /><br />&lsquo;Toni-ssi, we never did set up a time for that basketball game.&rsquo; Toni looked up at him, her thoughts suddenly clear again, and she focused on what he was saying.<br /><br />&lsquo;Are you saying you&rsquo;re up for the challenge?&rsquo; Her eyes regained their spark and Minho smiled in confirmation. Toni&rsquo;s body tensed up as if she was ready to race him to the door, and that made Minho burst out in laughter. Toni laughed too. They ended their tutoring session early and practically raced to the nearby neighborhood basketball court that he had told her about. Toni was able to forget about what may have happened if Minho&rsquo;s text message hadn&rsquo;t interrupted her kiss with Taemin. She was able to relax and have some fun, even if it was for such a short time.<br /><br />*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Toni had work again the next day, this time with the members she hadn&rsquo;t worked with yet. That made one thing very clear: she would definitely be seeing Onew.<br /><br />She tried to push that thought out of her mind while she got dressed. She hadn&rsquo;t gotten much sleep last night, partly because she was terrified she would oversleep again, and partly because of the worry she had just pushed out of her mind. She hadn&rsquo;t seen Onew since their bathroom tryst, and that was just the way she liked it.<br /><br />She sighed at the jumbled mess her life had become and made her way out the door. She was surprised to find a flower vase similar to the one from yesterday awaiting her in front of the door. No matter how she tried to, she couldn&rsquo;t fight the smile that seemed to plaster itself to&nbsp;her face and refused to leave.<br /><br />She was still in a good mood when she got to work. She was there probably an hour earlier than she needed to be, and her tired eyes were cursing her for that. She went into the tutoring room and sat down at the table to wait for whoever it was that she was tutoring first. She had to work around their schedules since they were all so busy with various activities that she wasn&rsquo;t even sure who it would be showing up for each session. She couldn&rsquo;t stifle a yawn, and decided that maybe a small nap wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. She set the alarm on her phone for 45 minutes later to make sure she was up and prepared for her tutoree before they showed up. She laid her head down on the table and let sleep overtake her.<br /><br />She awoke suddenly not long after that. She didn&rsquo;t know how much time had passed, but she felt like something was off&hellip;it felt like someone was watching her.<br /><br />&lsquo;You&rsquo;re up?&rsquo; She heard from across the room. She turned her attention to where the melodious voice had been coming from and saw none other than Onew standing there. She automatically went into fight mode and Onew noticed this.<br /><br />&lsquo;Relax tiger. I&rsquo;m not going to try anything.&rsquo; She still looked suspicious. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. That time I had had a few drinks on the plane and I guess I was trying to test you. I don&rsquo;t really know myself why I did that. When I drink I tend to&hellip;act like a different person? Anyways, I&rsquo;m sorry because it seems like most of the interactions we&rsquo;ve had have been after I&rsquo;ve had a few.  There any way that we could possibly start over? I&rsquo;d want to treat you to something to make up for everything.&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni wanted more than anything for this offer to be true. While she would fight to the death with anyone who actually started a fight, she wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable with conflict when it came to serious matters. Sure she would pick fights when it came to small things, but not something like being on such bad terms with a coworker. She wanted to believe him, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure how much she could trust him. One thing about Onew though, was that he had always been completely open with his intentions for her. He had never hidden his distaste for her, and oddly enough she felt like that made her able to trust him.<br /><br />&lsquo;Alright, we can start over.&rsquo; Onew breathed a sigh of relief. &lsquo;But about treating me&hellip;&rsquo; He waited in anticipation of her no. I mean, it was obvious. There had been so much strife between them, there was no way in hell that she&rsquo;d&mdash;<br /><br />&lsquo;I have expensive tastes, so make sure you bring your wallet.&rsquo; She beamed a smile at him, happy that she had one less headache to worry about. Onew was a little surprised. He had seen her smile when she had been talking to Taemin, Minho, even the CEO, but this was the first time it had been just for him. His heart skipped a beat and he suddenly felt nervous.  He vaguely remembered their bathroom scene and what she had felt like in his arms.  He had to focus all his energy on maintaining his cool fa&ccedil;ade.  It failed miserably when he tumbled to the ground while trying to take the seat next to Toni. <br /><br />As he had trained his body to do, he subconsciously made a show out of the fall and then laid there flat on the ground, covering his face to hide his embarrassment.  His &lsquo;ssangtae&rsquo; had started out as him trying to find a funny way to hide the little bit of clumsiness that he was prone to.  It had become a habit now, and for better or worse this was how he made people laugh&hellip;even if it did make him look like an idiot in front of a girl he might possibly like.<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh my god! Are you okay?&rsquo; Toni was at his side before he could even really process what had happened. &lsquo;Are you alright?&rsquo; She grabbed his hand, pulling him up into a sitting position. She underestimated her strength and ended up pulling him dangerously close to her face.  Her breath caught, and this time it was her turn to remember their airplane rendezvous.<br /><br />She stood up, abruptly trying to widen the distance between them. She still extended her hand, however, and helped him to his feet.<br />&lsquo;Thank you for not laughing.&rsquo; He said, awkwardly trying to regain his long forgotten composure. <br /><br />&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to thank me for. I&rsquo;m clumsy, so I know how much it sucks to fall and have someone laugh at you. I&rsquo;d rather we just forget about it and get started with the lesson.&rsquo; Onew was astonished. Toni had an air about her that was different than any other woman he had met before.  She didn&rsquo;t play games or try to win him over by pretending to be what she thought he wanted.  He was tired of the same pretty girls that had nothing more than their bodies to offer.  As much as he didn&rsquo;t want to admit it, he was both nervous and excited about taking Toni out later. He chided himself. He hadn&rsquo;t felt like this since high school.<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>Toni, you don&rsquo;t have to try so hard with the English with me</strong>.&rsquo; He told her ten minutes into their lesson.<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>Why</strong>?&rsquo; She asked, amused at what his answer would be this time.<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>Because I&rsquo;m fluent in English</strong>.&rsquo; He smiled, proud at her surprise. It was he who got the real surprise when he saw her eyes fill up with tears.&nbsp;&lsquo;<strong>What&rsquo;s the matter? Did I say something wrong</strong>?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>That&rsquo;s not it</strong>.&rsquo; She said quickly. &lsquo;<strong>It just feels so nice to hear English again. You&rsquo;re really good at it</strong>!&rsquo; She told him, wiping her eyes.<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>Thanks. It was my best subject in school</strong>.&rsquo; He beamed.<br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>Why are they making you get tutored then</strong>?&rsquo; <br /><br />&lsquo;<strong>I&rsquo;m not sure they know how good I am at it. Plus, it&rsquo;s something the big boss commanded, so no questions are to be asked</strong>.&rsquo;<br /><br />They sat there in silence for a few seconds while Toni thought about what he said.  She had read things online, stuff like he was a demon and that he did awful things. Toni had always seen him with a smile though&hellip;except for their meeting after what happened with Taemin.  She still got chills from remembering how cold his eyes were.  Other than that one time, however, the CEO had been nothing but nice to her.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;m not really necessary for you then. Hmmm&hellip;.I wonder if we should still practice it? There has to be some that you don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;How about this? Since you miss speaking English so much, why don&rsquo;t we just use this time to talk? We&rsquo;re starting over again anyway, and this would be a nice chance for me to show you the good side of myself.&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni thought for a second and then nodded her head in agreement. She smiled. &lsquo;That sounds like it would be fun.&rsquo; She leaned closer to him and lowered her voice to a whisper. &lsquo;Is fun allowed here?&rsquo;<br /><br />He picked up on her joke and decided to play along, letting her see him not being an asshole for once. He whispered back, &lsquo;Only when no one is looking.&rsquo; They shared a laugh and made plans for later on in the week when Onew would treat her to authentic Korean food. <br /><br />&lsquo;Alright, we&rsquo;re all set then. So&hellip;should I pick you up or&hellip;?&rsquo; He left the sentence hanging, waiting to confirm that she was thinking the same thing he was.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew-ssi, no need to be nervous,&rsquo; she giggled. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you there.  It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s a date or anything.&rsquo; His face fell but he tried to hide his disappointment.  She wasn&rsquo;t thinking the same thing he was, but at that point he would take whatever he could get.<br /><br />&lsquo;Okay. This is my number.  If you get lost or anything, just give me a call and I&rsquo;ll help you find your way there.&rsquo; He handed her a small piece of paper he had just written on, said he would see her then (since they didn&rsquo;t meet again that week), then he left. Toni sat down in her seat again and tried to process what had just happened. She replayed the lesson in her head and went over everything that had been said and done.  She couldn&rsquo;t be happier that something she was so worried and stressed over was now something she could maybe look forward to. After all, she was in a strange place&mdash;she could use friends.<br /><br />Speaking of Korean friends, Toni thought of Taemin for the 4000th time that day. She was annoyed by how under her skin he seemed to have gotten.  She was feeling like a teenage schoolgirl again. She wanted more than anything to avoid Taemin, but then there was that tiny part of her that loved that feeling; that small piece of her that was encouraging her to try to find him, that wanted to talk to him, to feel his skin against hers, to ask him what made her so special out of all the women that wanted to be with him?  Then there was that larger part of her that would scream at that small part, kicking the hell out of it.  She could hear her brain screaming at her heart. &lsquo;<em>ARE YOU STUPID?! DO YOU WANT TO JUST STAB YOURSELF IN THE CHEST RIGHT NOW AND GET IT OVER WITH?! UGHHHH. You said you weren&rsquo;t going to do this again, and now here you go, falling all over this guy you just met.  If you&rsquo;re going to fall in love again, how about you do it with someone who isn&rsquo;t going to hurt you? Someone you actually stand a chance of being with? Someone you can have a future with?</em>&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni stopped her inner monologue by remembering the promise she had made that she wouldn&rsquo;t fall in love again&hellip;with anyone. Taemin was a fun time, but that&rsquo;s all it was&mdash;a one time fun fling. No way would she fall in love with him&hellip;right?<br /><br />As if he was conjured from her thoughts, Taemin walked into the tutoring room. <br />&lsquo;Noona, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here! I was hoping you would be, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure.&rsquo; He walked over to where she was sitting and pulled the chair that was sitting next to her even closer than it already was, sitting down next to her. He gave her a peck on the cheek and pulled back with a smile, seemingly proud of himself. Toni&rsquo;s mouth flew open at his brazenness. <br /><br />&lsquo;Taemin,&rsquo; she started, preparing the same lecture she had given him at least half a dozen times. He cut her off.<br /><br />&lsquo;Noona, why do you pretend you don&rsquo;t want me?&rsquo; Her head snapped back from the sudden bold question. &lsquo;It seems like you think if you say it enough times it&rsquo;ll be true.  It won&rsquo;t.  I know you want me just as badly as I want you.  We&rsquo;ve already proven that once, so why are we tiptoeing around it now? Come on noona~&rsquo; He put his hand on her knee, touching it lightly before tracing his fingers along her thigh.  He looked up at her, his eyes trying to convince her just as much as his hands were. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t we pick up where we left off yesterday?&rsquo;<br /><br />It took every bit of resistance Toni had in her to push his hand off her leg and stand up to leave,  she did want him, God how she wanted him&hellip;she wanted to throw him down on top of the table and take him right there&hellip;but she couldn&rsquo;t do that.  She couldn&rsquo;t throw away everything she had worked so hard for for one moment of mind shattering pleasure.  She wouldn&rsquo;t let herself.<br /><br />&lsquo;Taemin, I&rsquo;m sorry, but what almost happened yesterday shouldn&rsquo;t have. I&rsquo;m sorry, and I don&rsquo;t know why I keep letting myself get into these situations with you&hellip;&rsquo; She frowned, seeming to get lost in wondering about why she does that.<br /><br />He looked up at her, making sure he locked his gaze with hers.  His eyes darkened, turning into black orbs before he finally spoke again.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ok Toni.&rsquo; He stood up, his eyes never leaving hers.  He leaned closer to her, lowering his head until he was level to her face. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t keep me waiting too long&hellip;even I don&rsquo;t know what will happen.&rsquo; With that he turned on his heels and left the room, leaving her there to consider his warning and try not to freak out over him actually saying her name instead of the standard noona.  How could he change so drastically in the span of a day? She didn&rsquo;t know who exactly she would be talking to whenever she saw him.  He could seem so adult and then at other times he was just like a child. He could be sweet one moment and then frustrating the next. Innocent and then insanely seductive.  He was impossible to figure out, and she didn&rsquo;t know what he was really like, what kind of person he was.  That was something that both intrigued and terrified her.</lj-cut>"

"event","Title: The Rhythm<br /><br />Chapter: 6<br /><br />Rating: PG<br /><lj-cut text=""Taemin got that mischievous in his eyes once again, and grabbed her hand, pulling her up out of her seat. 'I've worked hard and been a good boy this whole time. I think I deserve a reward. I want to try American cooking, and I want it to be yours.""><br />'And this is where you'll be.' A random staffer of SM told Toni, leading her into her new home.<br /><br />It was located in a building where other staff members lived too, and luckily it was only two blocks away from the office. She would pretty much have to go out of her way to get lost.<br /><br />She'd finally been told what her job was to be, and while she would be doing odd jobs like providing subtitles for youtube videos, but her main focus was to tutor artists who were preparing for an American debut.<br /><br />Toni could only laugh when she saw who her first group of artists would be. Of course it was SHINee...of course. She rubbed her temples at just remembering, and finally gave herself a chance to look at her new residence.<br /><br />It was smaller than the flat she had shared with her cousin had been, but that didn't make it any less nice. The walls were a calming light brown color, and all the furnishings were classic, but with a modern flare--white and brown tones accenting the mood of the room.<br /><br />Toni sighed happily, settling down to unpack her things and trying to wrap her mind around how much her life had changed recently. She had uprooted herself from everything familiar to her. She was in a foreign country that she had only ever dreamed about, but really had no clue about the traditions or the culture, she had a seventeen year old that made her confused in every way that a seventeen year old should never confuse someone of her age, and she had a demon of a man that for some reason had made it his mission to make her life hell.<br /><br />Toni was only too grateful for how quickly sleep came to her that night. Almost as soon as her head touched the pillow, she was overtaken and fell into a deep sleep, building up her energy for the inevitable tiring day that was to follow.<br /><br />She awoke suddenly the next morning, the sunshine refusing to let her sleep in. She looked around, bewildered for a moment before reality hit her like a ton of bricks. She wasn't in Cali anymore. She was in Seoul, South Korea, and she was late for work.<br /><br />'FUUUUUUUUCK!' she groaned out, rushing around quickly trying to grab all she needed, not even bothering to look in the mirror. She had heard some things, and from what she knew, you don't fuck around with Korean business men, especially not at SM&nbsp;Entertainment.<br /><br />She flew out the door, nearly tripping over a random flower vase that had been left in the hallway. She caught herself midway, however, and hastily glanced around in an effort to find the culprit who had left it there. Seeing no one else in the deserted hallway, she brushed it off and decided that someone must have left it there by accident. Plus, she really didn't have time to worry about something so small that morning.<br /><br />Toni almost lost her way when going to the building. Kicking herself and hating how forgetful she could be, she somehow still managed to make it to work on time, luckily. Unluckily, however, she was met with one of the two people she least wanted to see: Taemin.<br /><br />'Oh, Noona! You're here!' he greeted her, not hesitating to pull her into an embrace.<br /><br />'TAEMIN!' she hissed, noticing some of the looks they were getting from passing spectators in the hallway. 'Damn.' She mumbled under her breath, pulling him quickly into the room she had been told she would be using.<br /><br />'Taemin...do we really have to go through this <em>again</em>? I told you to please not do that kind of thing in public.<br /><br />'Ehhhhhhh.....' he pouted, puffing out his cheeks in a way she was sure so many other women had lost their hearts to. 'But this is how I greet all my noonas...this or candy. Would you rather have some of my candy?' he asked, widening his eyes to feign innocence. His act was made clear though by the look on the rest of his face-- the little glint in his eye and the way his lips slightly curled up on one side. He was teasing her.<br /><br />'Yes!' She snapped, making him take a step backwards. 'If that means that you stop with all the PDAs, I would LOVE a piece of candy every time I see you. Now, you're my first student, so can you sit down and let's get started?!' Toni slammed her book on the table, taking her seat and motioning for Taemin to do the same in the one next to her. He could tell from the look in her eyes that she wasn't playing around anymore. She could be quite intimidating when she put her mind to it.<br /><br />He obediently did as he was told, lowering his eyes and pushing out his lower lip in a sign of his displeasure. They were at it for about half an hour before Taemin let out a frustrated groan, pushing the English book as far away from himself as possible and laying his head flat down on the table.<br /><br />'Ahhh, I can't. I can't focus for one more minute! Noona..............I'm starving!!! I need fooooooood!!' he whined to Toni, giving her his best puppy dog face.<br /><br />Toni bit down on her lip, trying her best to remember how much he annoyed and frustrated her. It was useless. She didn't know how this adorable, irresistible boy had come from the sexy, cool man she had come in contact with in California, but she just couldn't stay angry at him.<br /><br />'Aigoo,' she said, ruffling his hair with her hand. If this was the Taemin she had to deal with while she was in Korea, it would be no problem. This Taemin was like a puppy, not like the previous emperor of the night who had owned her body and soul.<br /><br />'And just what would our Taeminnie like to eat?'<br /><br />'Hmmm....STEAK!'<br /><br />'Is there anywhere around here that has good takeout?'<br /><br />'But noona...I prefer homemade...' he whined.<br /><br />Toni got a worried look on her face and started nibbling on her bottom lip.<br /><br />'What's the matter noona?' he inched closer, giving her a concerned look. 'Can't you cook?'<br /><br />'I just.....it's just....American cooking is a lot different than Korean. I don't know how to make it like you would like it. Plus, I don't know where to buy anything, and it would be wildly inappropriate to have you at my home, and I just don't think it's a good idea...' she trailed off, thinking about the laundry list of reasons why she shouldn't have this boy in her apartment.<br /><br />Taemin got that mischievous look in his eyes once again, and grabbed her hand, pulling her up out of her seat.<br />'I've worked hard and been a good boy this whole time. I think I deserve a reward. I want to try American cooking, and I want it to be yours. I know where the best market is, and if anyone even thinks about saying anything about it, I'll shut them up personally.'<br /><br />His words had a forceful confidence to them, and they resounded within Toni, their weight settling on her and for some reason making her think what he was saying was true...making her feel safer.<br /><br />Toni was thinking all this before she was jerked back to reality in the form of Taemin tugging her out of the room and straight towards the exit. They were met in the hallway by a very shocked Minho. Toni made Taemin wait in the background for her while she tried to give Minho some semblance of an explanation for what was happening.<br /><br />'Oh Minho!' she exclaimed, still breathless from being pulled the last few feet. 'We're going to go grab something to&nbsp; eat. Hungry?' She ignored the death glare her words incited from behind her back.<br /><br />Minho looked from Toni to Taemin to Toni to Taemin before he finally shook his head no.<br />'That's alright, I just ate. Make sure to ask me next time. We're still on for later today right?'<br /><br />'The tutoring? Yes! I'll be back before long. Just going to get a quick lunch.'<br /><br />Taemin's patience finally wore thin, and he came up next to Toni, tugging urgently on her arm. 'Sorry hyung, but I'm starving, so I'm going to steal her away. See you later at the house!' And with that makeshift excuse and an apologetic look from Toni they were out the door, leaving Minho there bewildered shaking his head.<br /><br />What followed could have been a goofy shopping montage from one of Toni's beloved romantic comedies. Taemin was right. The market was amazing, and Toni loved seeing how excited he got about everything-- the way his eyes would light up when he found something he had been searching for, or how he practically jumped up and down and squealed when they came across the banana milk. She didn't know whether she should be guarded around him, or feel guilty for sleeping with such a kid. Either way, she couldn't deny that being with him was fun.<br /><br />They checked out and made their way back to her apartment. Toni again noticed the flower in front of her door, but this time she noticed that her name was the one written on the card. She had pushed it to the back of her mind and had forgotten the entire incident from that morning until she came across it again.<br /><br />'Noona, what's this?' Taemin asked, raising an eyebrow and picking up the vase.'You have admirers already?! I'm going to have to step up my game...' He chuckled to himself, giving Toni more than a slight clue as to who it was that had left the flower there.She smiled to herself when she saw what the flower was, and marveled at how amazing this kid really was. I mean...how could he possibly know that honeysuckles were her favorite flowers in the world?<br /><br />They entered the apartment and Toni set about getting the steak underway. She left Taemin to his own devices because, after all, she had to be back at the company in a couple of hours for her session with Minho, and who knew what kind of shenanigans he would cause if she let him in the kitchen.<br /><br />They chatted through the rooms while she cooked, him telling her about what it was like to be an idol and her telling him what it was like to grow up in a holler.<br /><br />When everything was finished and Taemin finally tasted the food, he chewed a couple of times then closed his eyes, laying his head back and letting out a low moan.<br /><br />'Wow. I didn't know you were hiding a talent like this. I never would have guessed!' he shouted to where she was cleaning up in the kitchen. 'You're going to make someone a great wife.'<br /><br />His words were followed by a clatter and then the familiar sound of glass hitting hardwood floor. He ran to the next room to see what had happened.<br /><br />Toni was sitting in the kitchen floor with pieces of a broken plate shattered around her feet. Her legs were drawn up to her chest and her hands covered her face. She was crying, but trying to desperately not to show it.<br /><br />Taemin didn't say a word. Instead, he crouched down on his knees next to her and pulled her gently into his arms, their positions now reversed as she played the role of a child crying in his arms that now seemed so adult, crying for reasons he didn't know.<br /><br />Toni finally calmed herself down, her sobs siphoning off to sniffles, and she suddenly realized the position she was in: sitting on her kitchen floor crying like the world was ending while this beautiful boy held her and stroked her hair, hoping that just holding her would provide the comfort she so desperately seemed to need.<br /><br />'I'm sorry.' She quickly let out, beginning to pick up the surrounding pieces of broken glass. The pieces were so metaphoric to what made her cry that it made her laugh out loud. 'I must look insane, huh? Crying one minute and laughing the next.' He shot her a look that confirmed what she had just said. She sighed. 'Go and finish eating. I'll be there in a minute.' He did what she said, not fighting her for once. She finished cleaning up then joined him.<br /><br />'I'm sorry you had to see that. I'm just...I know I'm going to regret telling you this, but I feel like I owe it to you after the cup of crazy you just had to endure.' Taemin looked up from his plate and flashed her a reassuring smile, but didn't say a word. <br /><br />'Actually,' she continued, 'you know that I'm not originally from California. I really grew up in a small town.' She paused, taking in a deep breath, seeming to collect all her strength for the next part. 'I was engaged before I moved.' She noticed the way his eyebrows raised in a show of surprise that the rest of his body tried to hide. 'We were high school sweethearts that turned into college lovers that turned into fiances...we were going to get married right after we graduated...' She swallowed, hard. 'Long story short: men are cheating bastards with no emotions, Toni's heart was broken, and love doesn't exist.' She went to wipe away a stray tear that had lingered behind her eyelid and finally spilled forth. Before she could reach it, Taemin had already wiped it for her.<br /><br />'Hey, don't be like that. You're special. If that guy can't see that, then there's something wrong with him. And all this talk about love not existing...I think love is what you make it. Something as small as butterflies in your stomach, your heart beating faster, or being convinced that someone makes the best steak in the world...can't those things be love too? Even just a little bit?' He leaned over the table and tucked a stray hair behind her ear, looking deeply in her eyes before slowly leaning forward and taking her lips in his.<br /><br />Toni felt a blush come to her cheeks, and those butterflies and fast heartbeats he had just been talking about seemed to have made their way to her.<br /><br />This boy was quicksand. It was terrifying, and she wasn't sure if she was ready, but she could feel herself slowly sinking into him.</lj-cut>"

Feel free to read if you want, if you don&#39;t *shrugs* Meh, it&#39;s not for you anyway XP</p><br />Pairing: A little of Sevin and a little of Seli XD<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><lj-cut>&nbsp;It seems like it takes her forever to answer the door. I know what the hold up is without her telling me. She&#39;s in the bathroom straightening her hair&nbsp;and trying to make the red in her cheeks a little less obvious. She&#39;d never admit it to anyone, but she&nbsp;always wants people to see her at her best-- especially me. It doesn&#39;t make a difference though, because as soon as she opens the door, I can see the hurt written all over her face.</lj-cut><br /><br />She flashes me a forced smile, trying to act strong even up to this point, and I hold up the plastic bag I brought with me, full of reinforcements to bring that beautiful smile back to that face.<br /><br />Sev grabs greedily at the Chunky Monkey and DVDs I&#39;m holding up, pulling the bag out of my hands and playfully shutting the door in my face.<br /><br />I laugh.<br /><br />She always has that talent: to make me laugh when no one else can. <em>As if</em> ice cream and DVDs are all she needs me for.<br /><br />She reopens the door and lets me inside, giggling at her own mischievousness. When we get to the living room, Sev eyes through the DVDs I brought. Suddenly, she looks up and gives me a wry smile, holding up her hand in that all too familiar sign, and I shoot her one right back. Nothing like a little &#39;Live long and prosper&#39; to stave away heartache.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t take long for us to get into the same position we&#39;d been in a thousand times before: sitting on the couch in front of the TV, sharing a pint of ice cream, and geeking out over Spock while she snuggled up next to me and the only thing I could focus on was the feeling of her head on my shoulder.<br /><br />It takes all of my willpower not to ask what the son of a bitch has done this time, but I know that talking about it will only make her cry again. I hate it. I hate it that he has so much of her that a word from him can make her day or turn it to shit. I hate that I&#39;ve been put in this position of picking up the pieces he broke on those shit days. I hate that I&#39;ve become like her best girl friend. I hate how much I love her needing me.<br /><br />Eventually, she breaks the silence to tell me about what wrong he has done this time.<br /><br />&#39;He likes someone,&#39; she finally squeaks out, turning her head to bury it in the couch. I know that she&#39;s trying to hide her tears, and that just pisses me off.<br /><br /><em>Bastard.</em> I wish I could punch him, once for each tear he&#39;s made her cry. I take a deep breath, not wanting her to know everything I&#39;m feeling.<br /><br />&#39;I haven&#39;t heard anything about it. What makes you so sure?&#39;<br /><br />&#39;I just know, OK?!&#39; She snaps at me. I let it roll off my back. I can tell she regrets it almost as soon as she says it, and that I&#39;m the only person she can let herself be a wreck in front of, and that makes it alright.....forgivable.<br /><br />She takes a deep breath before forcing out what has been eating her up all night.<br /><br />&#39;He told me about her. Said he didn&#39;t like her, but just thought she was interesting.&#39; Her eyes begin to well up with tears, and I know the hard part is coming up. &#39;He said that I was like his brother...laughing. It&#39;s funny, right?&#39; A few rebellious tears escape from her eyes. &#39;Isn&#39;t that the funniest thing you&#39;ve ever heard? I&#39;m so honored...&#39; She finally stops holding back and lets herself cry, making her way into my&nbsp;waiting arms and crying to her heart&#39;s content. Coming from anyone else, she would have&nbsp;considered that&nbsp;a compliment, but not him...not him.<br /><br />Her tears finally siphen off into sniffles, and I know this is the part I&#39;m needed for. This is why she picked up the phone and dialed my number.I look at her, taking in her disheveled appearance-- the way her hair is messed up, but still looks like she meant for it to be; the way that even though she&nbsp;was just crying so hard, her face doesn&#39;t get swollen or ugly, but just looks like she&#39;s blushing; the way her eyes&nbsp;glisten even brighter than usual because of the tears...<br /><br />She doesn&#39;t know it, but half of&nbsp;the time&nbsp;she thinks I&#39;m looking&nbsp;into her eyes, I&#39;m actually looking at the adorable little beauty mark she has on her eyelid. For the longest time I hadn&#39;t even known it was there, but when I realized it was, I felt like it was something secret-- a part of her that not everyone knew about, but I got to see.<br /><br />That&#39;s the thing about her, what makes her so special. Just like how you could look at her face every day and not realize something at minuscule and beautiful as that little mole was there, when you thought you finally had her figured out she did something you would never expect. Maybe that&#39;s why I keep coming back even though I know I&#39;m not the person she wants to be holding her. Maybe that&#39;s why I can&#39;t just walk away...<br /><br />I know that I need to do something to make her laugh, and the only thing I can think to do is tickle her (even though I know she isn&#39;t ticklish). I get a shock when a peal of giggles leaves her mouth. I try again, and am met with another squeal. How should I take this? I know she&#39;s not really ticklish...maybe she just wants to laugh as much as I want to make her laugh?<br /><br />Whatever the reason may be, I now&nbsp;find myself in this situation: hovering over her after she fell off the couch from laughing so hard. Watching her as she tries&nbsp;to calm herself down. Just having her under me makes me want to kiss her. She finally stops laughing, and I know she knows what I&#39;m thinking. She doesn&#39;t pull away,&nbsp;but instead she looks up at me, her eyes scanning my face while I look at her. Is he the one she&#39;s seeing right now? My chest tightens&nbsp;from the thought.<br /><br />I want to close the distance&nbsp;between us, to give her&nbsp;a kiss she will never forget, to drive out every thought from her head that&nbsp;doesn&#39;t have me in it, to&nbsp;make her completely&nbsp;mine....but....I can&#39;t.<br /><br />I know her. I know if I take that step it won&#39;t help&nbsp;her smile, but will only make her worry more. I don&#39;t want&nbsp;her to stress herself out about what would happen if we didn&#39;t work out, about what she would do if she lost me. I know, because I worry about&nbsp;the exact same thing every time I see her. I don&#39;t want her to torture herself from feeling like she had betrayed him, even though he had never given her a&nbsp;sign he wanted anything more than friendship from her. I don&#39;t want to make her cry.<br /><br />So I just sit there over her,&nbsp;counting my breaths and looking at the beautiful prize I can just never seem to win.<br /><br />I&#39;m finally put out of my misery by the ringing&nbsp;of her cellphone. I know from the way her eyes light up whose voice it is on the other end of the phone: Kevin. She quickly rushes out from under me and into the next room, leaving me to sit there and think about what a pitiful and&nbsp;bitter creature I&#39;ve become because of this damn woman. I wonder if Kevin can hear how her voice is thick because of the tears she had just been crying, or that behind every&nbsp;smile she gives him are those words that neither of&nbsp;us can seem to force out.<br /><br />Kevin&nbsp;doesn&#39;t know&nbsp;how lucky he is. I&nbsp;wish I could see her&nbsp;as a little brother. I wish I&nbsp;didn&#39;t leave with this heavy feeling in my stomach every time I&nbsp;left her. I wish....<br /><br />I decide that it&#39;s about time&nbsp;for me to head home. I&#39;ve&nbsp;been around for their&nbsp;conversations before, and they can take a&nbsp;while. I sigh to myself and quickly scribble down a&nbsp;note. Maybe it&#39;ll make her give me a thought before&nbsp;she sleeps?&nbsp;<br /><br />I just smile. All I can&nbsp;do now is laugh at this situation I&#39;ve let myself fall into. What can I do? I&nbsp;think I might l--<br /><br /><strong>Steph,</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know who&#39;s on&nbsp;the other end of the phone, lol.

She wanted to bury herself under her seat and have someone dig her out when they arrived at Seoul. She hated her dumb ass. Did it matter if he could kiss? An asshole is still an asshole."">&nbsp;Toni laid her head back against the headrest, taking deep breaths to try to calm herself down. She had never been on a plane before, and she was doing what she always did when she was nervous or worried: losing herself in her music. She would rather die than let the two people sitting around her know it, but she had spent the better part of the night before looking through sites online, downloading as much kpop as she could get her hands on, and digging up information on the people who would now be filling her days.<br /><br />Even she couldn&rsquo;t believe how fast her life was changing. When she had gone to find her cousin at the hotel two days before, she found the CEO instead. He had been in a jolly mood, obviously having had his fair share of alcohol, and he made her an offer she couldn&rsquo;t refuse. He asked her if she would come to work for their company as a translator/tutor/any other random thing they needed her English and Korean skills for. For someone unemployed, this was an offer that she just couldn&rsquo;t refuse. She knew that this meant she would be seeing Taemin on a pretty regular basis, but she had sworn to herself that she wouldn&rsquo;t be drawn in any more than she already was. She shoved out all thoughts of his eyes and touches, and determined herself to just go there and work, and maybe fall even more in love with the culture than she already had.<br /><br />Toni heaved a sigh, trying to release all the worries she had about this hasty decision, and went to lay her arm on the arm rest next to her. She got quite the shock when she touched someone else&rsquo;s skin. She immediately jerked her arm back, and looked up in surprise. She hadn&rsquo;t noticed anyone had sat down because she had been so lost in the world of her thoughts and music. She took a headphone out and apologized quickly to the person sitting next to her. Only then did she get a good enough look to be able to see who it was. <br /><br />She recognized him immediately and said a silent thanks to her studying up of idols. Now she knew who not to make a fool of herself in front of, which she had just done in front of Minho from SHINee. He released a small chuckle and went back to his game. <br /><br />Toni glanced over slightly and was just able to make out what game it was that Minho was holding in his hands. She couldn&rsquo;t contain her excitement. Without catching herself, she leaned over more into his seat, and stared while he played the game. <br /><br />Minho laughed at her big reactions, and his chuckling made her realize what she was doing. She drew back into her seat, a deep blush forming on her cheeks.<br /><br />&lsquo;Sorry, I just used to love that game when I was a kid. I haven&rsquo;t seen it in forever. I guess I got too excited.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh? Well, I&rsquo;m having trouble getting past this part&hellip;I can never make it out of this mine.&rsquo; His eyebrows furrowed together, and Toni could see how much not being able to beat it was bothering him.  He tried once again to make it out of the mine, and let out an exasperated groan when he fell flat. He looked like he was about two seconds away from screaming &lsquo;FUCK&rsquo; and throwing the game against the wall. <br /><br />&lsquo;You&rsquo;re jumping too soon.&rsquo; He looked up. &lsquo;I had that problem forever before I actually figured out the right timing.&rsquo; She reassured him, letting him know it wasn&rsquo;t a problem that was with him. He looked suspicious, that the solution couldn&rsquo;t possibly be that simple, and that he wasn&rsquo;t able to figure it out himself. He tried doing what she said on the next turn, and let out a loud victory cheer when it actually worked, turning to her with gleaming eyes. He looked like a little boy who had gotten locked inside Willy Wonka&rsquo;s chocolate factory for the night.<br /><br />&lsquo;THANK YOU!&rsquo; He almost squealed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to beat that part <em>forever!</em> It was so frustrating! Do you want to play too?&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni bit down on her lower lip, not even bothering to hesitate with her answer. She nodded excitedly, half so happy over something so dear from her childhood and half from making her first Korean friend.<br /><br />They passed three hours like that&mdash;passing the game back and forth and just chatting about their childhoods and interests. He got a surprise when she challenged him to a game of basketball, and even warned him that she didn&rsquo;t play nice.<br /><br />&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t lose.&rsquo; He warned her, his face hardening in a sign of how serious he was about competing.<br /><br />&lsquo;Neither do I.&rsquo; She glared back, the gauntlet clearly thrown, staring at his eyes for a few seconds before they both burst out into laughter.<br /><br />Toni clutched her sides. She hadn&rsquo;t laughed that hard in a while, and it felt good. Minho reminded her of her best friend from high school. Thinking of him made a rush of memories from home come flooding back all of a sudden. The reality that she was leaving everything she knew, everything that was safe to her, hit her like a ton of bricks.<br /><br />She quickly excused herself to the restroom, for fear of having a breakdown right there in front of everyone. She didn&rsquo;t want to be labeled the crazy white girl the CEO had picked up in America. That was something she most definitely did not need.<br /><br />Toni swallowed down the rock that had formed in her throat and splashed a few handfuls of cold water on her face, wiping away the tears that threatened to spill out. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyes were shining a bright green, the white tinted slightly pink because of her tears, her cheeks a light red from her emotion and all the cold water. She sighed. Nothing she could really do about the state she was in right now, so she smoothed down her hair and took a last deep breath before exiting the small bathroom. She hadn&rsquo;t noticed that someone had left their seat behind her when she had gotten up, and had followed her to the bathroom.<br /><br />Before she even knew what was happening, Onew had pushed her back into the bathroom, the cramped space becoming even more so with the addition of another body.<br /><br />He trapped her against the wall, hands on each side of her head, and she turned her face to the right, feeling herself begin to shake with rage. <em>&lsquo;Why should I have to put up with this shit from someone I barely know and haven&rsquo;t even done anything to?!?!</em>&rsquo; Kept replaying over and over in her head like a scrolling marquee. <br /><br />Onew looked at the body in front of him&mdash;the way she shyly turned her head away from his, the way she had started to slightly quiver from fear of what he would do next, and he felt the predator inside him awaken.<br /> <br />He leaned closer to her, breathing in that scent that was unique only to her, and finally let everything that had been building up inside him spew out.<br /><br />&lsquo;So&hellip;was Taemin not enough for you?&rsquo; His breath was hot on her ear. &lsquo;Is Minho next?&rsquo; He lowered his arm to her side, hesitating at her hip. &lsquo;Are you going after all of SHINee?&rsquo; He gently traced his fingers along the waistline of her jeans, grazing the skin that was slightly exposed, before hooking his finger through her belt loop and pulling her closer to him. Toni decided in that moment that she had had enough of being played around with by this damn man, and that she would show him what being played with really felt like. <br /><br />She shoved down her rage and softened her gaze. She turned her head to face him, scanning his face while slightly biting on her lower lip. She finally brought her eyes to his, locking gazes, making him forget what his original purpose was, what he was doing, or that he could even think anything coherent at all.<br /><br />She brought one hand up to his head, threading her fingers through his soft hair, and slid her other hand under his shirt, touching his flat stomach softly as she slowly traced her fingers down to the sensitive area below his navel. She tightened her grip lightly on his hair and pulled his head down closer to her face.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew-ssi~&rsquo; She practically moaned, loving the way his breath hitched at hearing his name leave her lips. She knew she may be taking it too far, and she hesitated slightly at this point, but this was a lesson he needed to learn. She further tilted his head down, watching the way his eyes started to close in anticipation of what her next move would be. <br /><br />She felt a pang of guilt at just playing with him, but not enough to overpower the anger she still had boiling inside her from earlier. She gulped down any qualms and brought his lips to hers, impatiently kissing at them, pushing them apart and touching her tongue to his. She moved her hand from his stomach to waist, and used it to pull him against her. Onew was too engrossed in the still ongoing kiss to even notice anything else was going on. <br /><br />She pressed herself against him, making sure she grinded her hips into his, and could feel him growing steadily harder with each touch of her tongue and each rub of her body. The more intense their kiss grew, the more she could feel his need for her grow. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her even further into him, and continued his exploration of her mouth. That was enough. That was all she needed. <br />She pulled back slowly, ending their kiss and leaving him standing there with heavy lidded eyes, completely lost in what had just happened. <br />She kept her fingers laced through his hair and leaned close to him once again.<br /><br />&lsquo;Onew-ssi~&rsquo; He let out a low growl. &lsquo;If I wanted you, I could have you&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; And with that she broke from his embrace, exiting the small room, leaving him standing there feeling stunned and like a complete idiot, but so damn turned on he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with himself.<br /><br />Toni took her seat next to Minho, her emotions raging out of control, but this time for a different reason. As much as she couldn&rsquo;t stand the asshole, there was no denying the boy could kiss. She wanted to bury herself under her seat and have someone dig her out when they arrived at Seoul. She hated her dumb ass. Did it matter if he could kiss? An asshole is still an asshole.<br /><br />&lsquo;Are you alright?&rsquo; Minho asked, his worry showing on his face.<br /><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Just a little homesick.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Already?! Psh. I pegged you wrong. I didn&rsquo;t think you were such a pansy!&rsquo; He kidded, raising one brow.<br /><br />&lsquo;Shut up!&rsquo; She shot back, playfully smacking his arm and feeling her mood lift instantly. At that moment she thanked her lucky stars for giving her someone she didn&rsquo;t need to be weary of, someone she could just joke around with. They talked and played quietly for a while before she eventually nestled down and fell into a deep sleep for the rest of the flight, her emotional exhaustion finally taking its toll.</lj-cut>"

It was unseasonably cold for Seoul. I turned my back to the balcony scene below me to look through the streaked glass door behind me. <br /><br />The boy lying on my bed breathed steadily, his back rising and falling peacefully as he smiled in his sleep. <br />I took another draw off the cigarette in my hand and laid my head back, closing my eyes. I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this. I should rip the covers off him right now and shove him out my door, telling him to never come back. <br /><br />I laughed silently to myself at the image of him standing naked in the hallway without the slightest clue of what had happened, and then crushed the cigarette out. I hugged my arms tighter around myself, and decided it was too fucking cold to be outside anymore. <br /><br />The warmth from inside my apartment worked to comfort me, and I just wanted to snuggle up in bed next to the boy and lay there having a lazy day. I sighed at my inability to do this, and made my way over to his side of the bed. I sat down softly next to his shoulder and started my attack to wake him up.<br /><br />I stroked my hand down his back slowly, tracing small circles on the small of his back, while I leaned my mouth close to his head. &lsquo;Taemin~&rsquo; I whispered, taking his earlobe to my lips, nibbling gently on it before moving my mouth further down his neck, kissing and softly biting along my way. <br /><br />No reaction.<br /><br />His lack of moans frustrated me, so I looked up, wondering what the problem was. He wasn&rsquo;t asleep after all, and instead he greeted my gaze with an amused look, face breaking into a smile.<br /><br />My hand reached out in an effort to smack him for the teasing, but instead he grabbed my wrist with one hand, my waist with the other, and rolled over, pulling me on top of him in the process.    <br /><br />I felt him in between my legs, and realized he was already semi-hard. So he had felt what I&rsquo;d been doing to him. I chuckled on the inside. &lsquo;Taemin, we don&rsquo;t have time for it this morning.&rsquo; I said, making sure to grind my hips further into him, eliciting a delicious moan. I made my move to stand up, but he quickly grabbed my hips, firmly holding me in place on top of him.<br /><br />&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t just get me all worked up like that and then leave, noona. That&rsquo;s not playing very nice~&rsquo; He moved his hips slowly, rubbing in just the way he knew got me worked up the fastest.<br /><br />&lsquo;Damn.&rsquo; I sighed, resigning myself to the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t win against this boy. I lowered my head to his and sought out his lips, kissing all around them, but hesitating to actually meet them. He loved kissing. He was an amazing kisser, and I knew that teasing him with it drove him insane. I nibbled on his juicy bottom lip before gently pressing my lips to his. <br /><br />I kept my lips to his, but refused to let his tongue enter. He grunted his frustration and I felt his hands moving from where they had been resting on my hips. He lowered his hand until he reached my ass, and gave me a firm slap (probably harder than he should have, but for how frustrated I was making him, I could forgive him this once).  I cried out in pain from the sting of the slap, and he took this as his chance, slipping his tongue into my mouth. How could someone who had just woken up taste so sweet?<br /><br />It never ceased to amaze me how good he was at kissing. Sometimes I would wonder how many other women had gotten to touch those lips. How many other women had felt the way he tasted and teased you in all the right ways, while his hands roamed over your body, lightly touching the places he knew would make you throw your head back in pleasure?<br /><br />He&rsquo;d come a long way since we were kids. He wasn&rsquo;t that beautiful little boy anymore who would always follow me around and hang off my every word. He wasn&rsquo;t the little brat that got jealous of my first boyfriend and tried to show me how adult he was by trying to kiss me, even though he didn&rsquo;t have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. Even when I think back on it now, the way his lips quivered when he awkwardly pressed them to mine, he was too adorable for words. <br /><br />When had he turned into this monster, this&hellip;.<strong>man</strong> that was below me? When had he learned to turn me on with just a touch, or leave me breathless with just a taste of him? <br /><br />He must have sensed that I was somewhere else, because before I knew it I had been flipped over onto my back, him hovering above me. &lsquo;Noona,&rsquo; he whispered, his breath hot in my ear. &lsquo;You think too much.&rsquo; I felt his hand slide under my nightie, his beautiful brown eyes never leaving mine. Everywhere he touched felt hot, and I felt myself shivering in anticipation and pleasure. His hand found my breast, fondling it softly before he traced the outline of my nipple, fingers playing and tweaking it until he had me moaning softly with the slightest touch of it. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rsquo; He said, his gaze finally breaking in favor of tilting down his head to steal another kiss and leave me even more breathless. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think about anything else.&rsquo; His lips trailed down my neck, stopping to bite and suck it gently, knowing it was one of my weak spots. &lsquo;It feels good. Just lose yourself in that.' He lifted my nightie above my head, tossing it to the side, and fully exposing me for him to do whatever he wanted to. <br /><br />I still blushed red every time we got to this point. Every insecurity I had about my body was brought to the surface in the face of this gorgeous man. I moved my arms quickly to try to cover myself up even somewhat, but he grabbed my wrists, pinning them to either side of my head. He looked down at me, drinking me in, and giving me that look he had every time that was so full of awe and lust, that I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel beautiful. <br /><br />&lsquo;Why do you always act so shy?&rsquo; He lowered himself further down my body, taking the previously tortured nipple into his mouth, and using his amazing tongue skills to make me moan out his name. &lsquo;This body has been mine since I was 15.&rsquo; <br /><br />I stopped resisting, knowing full well that he was right. We had always been close. Even after he got accepted to be a trainee at SME, he would still come over to my house for dinner with my family sometimes, or he would sneak out of the dorm at nights when he was having trouble sleeping, seeking me out for whatever it was he found in me that made him feel better. There was always a comfortable space with us, that even though I had been the one to teach him how to kiss, he was my best friend, and that was where the line was drawn.<br /><br />Everything changed when I was 17. I fell in love. And no, it wasn&rsquo;t with Taemin. It was with a senior in my art club. He was smart, and everything I had ever wanted in a guy. He saw me as someone important, not just someone on the sidelines of his life, who would always be there when she was needed, but fade into the background when she wasn&rsquo;t. He loved me back.<br /><br />The first time Taemin came over after Jongmin and I started dating, I knew there would be hell to pay. He never texted first when he was coming; He would just show up outside my window in the shadows, feeling bad from whatever hardship had come from being an idol that day.<br /><br />When I heard the familiar tapping on my window, I felt my heart grow heavy, and it took all my strength not to just hide myself under the blankets and pretend I couldn&rsquo;t hear him. Tears readily sprang to my eyes when he tapped out the secret code that we had made up when we were kids. <br /><br />I hurried to the window, tip toeing so as not to wake up the rest of my sleeping family. I opened the window silently, letting him inside in the way we had done at least a thousand times before. He crawled into my room, and upon standing up gave me a big hug. I heard him release a relieved sigh, and it was as though I could feel all the tension that had been building up inside him since the last time we met just disappear. I felt myself sinking into him, and knew I needed to do what should be done before I was lost. Taemin had the power to always sweep me up in his pace. When I was with him, it seemed like there was no outside world, there was only that moment and doing any and everything I could to bring the smile back to his face.<br /><br />I gulped down the rock that had formed in my throat and broke from his embrace, shocking him out of his relief, and instantly alerting him that something was up.<br /><br />&lsquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Noona?&rsquo; He questioned as I made my way back to my bed. I crawled inside it and snuggled up under the covers, holding a fistful tightly under my chin and trying to calm myself down. If I wanted to let him know I was serious about this, I had to be able to talk to him about it and not just fall to pieces and back down from it. <br /><br />He started to follow me over to my bed but suddenly stopped when he was a couple of feet in front of my nightstand. I followed his gaze and saw what had stunned him enough to make him stop dead in his tracks. On the nightstand, where the picture of him and I used to stand, was now a picture of Jongmin and I. We had gone out on a date a few days earlier, and he had surprised me when we went to take a picture by sneaking and giving me a peck on the cheek. That moment was now sitting comfortably on the nightstand next to my head. I bit my lip and lowered my eyes.<br /><br />I waited for him to show some kind of reaction. I expected for him to throw the temper tantrum that he had always been known so well for, screaming and throwing things around the room in the way a child does when one of its toys has been taken away. That&rsquo;s why I nearly had a heart attack when I saw what his reaction was. <br /><br />He stood there just staring at the picture with his mouth open in a half gasp. I felt my heart shrivel when I saw the silent tear that made its way down his cheek. He didn&rsquo;t say a word. He just stood there, staring in disbelief at the picture as trails of tears zigzagged their escape route down his beautiful face.<br /><br />Before my mind could even process what I was doing, I had jumped out of my bed and was at his side, cradling his head in my arms as I repeated a chorus of I&rsquo;m sorrys over and over again.His hands reached up to cling to my arms, and I held onto him while he sobbed like a child. We stayed in that position until his cries resigned to sniffles and he finally pulled out of my embrace. He looked up at me, his eyes shining softly from the tears that he had just been shed, and reached out to touch my face.<br /><br />&lsquo;Idiot.&rsquo; He said, gently wiping away the tears I hadn&rsquo;t even realized had fallen. &lsquo;Why are you crying? I&rsquo;m the one who just had my heart broken. Crybaby. You need to toughen up if you want to make it in this world.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Speak for yourself,&rsquo; I replied, indignant, expecting his usual witty retort. All I got instead was a sad sigh.<br />&lsquo;I just&hellip;never thought you would abandon me. It may have been stupid and childish of me, but I&rsquo;ve never considered a life that didn&rsquo;t have you in it.&rsquo; He brought a hand to his eye, rubbing it roughly to rid himself of the few tears that lingered there and the embarrassing scene he had just let me witness. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m happy for you, and that I&rsquo;ll smile when I see you next time. I just&hellip;can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; He stood up quickly and started making his way back to the window, leaving me on my knees in the middle of the floor.<br /><br />It was like ice water had been thrown on me. What did that mean? He couldn&rsquo;t smile when he saw me? When would he smile? I was taking away his smile? Would he want to see me again? What would that make me? I had always been there because he needed someone to help him smile. If I couldn&rsquo;t even do that, then what use would I be to him? <br /><br />My mind raced in fear with all these thought, and I felt my chest constrict as he went to stride past me. I reached out and grabbed his hand shakingly before he made it by me. &lsquo;Taemin-ah,&rsquo; I whispered hesitantly. I was afraid that once he disappeared through the window, he would disappear from my life. He had debuted, there were hundreds, thousands that could easily and willingly take my place. What was so special about me?<br /><br />He looked down at me, his eyes questioning what else could possibly be left to say, so I gathered all my courage and stood up to face him. I stood on my tiptoes, wrapping my arms around his neck, and brought my lips to his. He raised his eyebrows in surprise, but soon enough he had wrapped his arms around my body and melted into the kiss. <br /><br />He pushed backwards, leading me to the bed. I let him. When there, as he kissed my body and explored me for the very first time, I looked over to my right and spotted the picture of Jongmin and I. I gulped down all the guilt that built up in my stomach and threatened to spill out, and placed the picture face down. <br /><br /><br />..................................................................................................................................................<br /><br /><br />After everything was over, I laid there just basking in the warmness that was Taemin and the act that we had just done.   There were so many emotions fighting inside me that all I could do was turn my head to the side and let hot tears flow out to dampen my pillow. Taemin must have felt what was wrong with me, because he pulled me closer to his side, hugging my back tightly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it happened this way, but I&rsquo;m not sorry it happened. You&rsquo;re the only person in this world I can&rsquo;t lose. For me to be able to live, I need you.&rsquo;<br /><br />Even if they were all lies, I didn&rsquo;t care. Those were the words I had always wanted to hear from him. I&rsquo;d wanted them since I realized I had feelings for the dorky neighbor kid who was two years younger than me, the boy who was now being loved and adored by so many other nameless, faceless people, the boy who had somehow managed to worm his way into my heart, and now my body. I looked up at the downturned picture again. I&rsquo;m sorry Jongmin. I&rsquo;m so sorry. Taemin is&hellip;Taemin is&hellip;Taemin just is. Taemin is a part of me I&rsquo;m not willing to lose yet. Forgive this selfish awful woman, please? I said my silent prayers to a person who would never hear them, and rolled over to face Taemin, snuggling further into him and nestling my head in the crevice between his neck and shoulder. It would soon become my favorite place in the world.<br /><br />That had been three years ago, and now I found myself in that same position. Well, not the literal same position. Right now he had made his way down my body and was hovering between my legs, a hand on either of my thighs, holding them open for him to get a better look.<br /><br />&lsquo;Mmm, Taemin,&rsquo; I let out, my embarrassment surfacing once again. This time I covered my face with my hands. He had a way of making me feel so vulnerable, unworthy, and yet stunning at the same time. Just knowing that this wonderful man, who was growing more beautiful day by day, took his time to be with me, and that even after three years he still wanted me, that was a feat in and of itself.<br /><br />I felt him lower himself further towards me, and he breathed out a content sigh. The warm air went right against me, touching in my most sensitive areas, and I almost lost it from that alone. When his tongue finally did touch me, I was a goner.  In no time at all, I had clenched two handfuls of his chestnut colored hair and was holding on for dear life as he gave me the pleasure that only he could. <br /></lj-cut>"

I wrote this, and I actually like it. Has the ending I like, and hopefully someone else will too?</p><br /><lj-cut text=""I wrote this a while back, and while it's not a fanfic, it's a short story that I really like, even though it's a little emo kid.""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ""><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Ipods are the most confounding things to me. For some reason they breed a curiosity that&rsquo;s unusual for me, because my general attitude is one of not giving a damn. They also make me somewhat oddly creative. I always wonder when I pass people with their headphones in their ears: just what is that person is listening to? It becomes a bit of a game for me. How about the 5&rsquo;2&rdquo; little Asian girl kicking it to Nelly?  I pass the jock wearing his football jersey, and I think what if he&rsquo;s listening to *NSYNC in there?  No one would ever be the wiser, and it could be like a 007 mission for the guy&hellip;hiding the songs under a Tupac folder, as if they were sensitive case matter. It makes for loads of entertainment, and opens my eyes to how much I truly stereotype people. <br />	<br />So when I saw her by chance on that muggy Saturday morning, you can imagine how stunned I was&hellip;nothing came to mind to imagine her trying to hide from people. It was the first time I hadn&rsquo;t been able to clearly label someone from how they looked. There was nothing all that amazing about her looks that would cause me to be so dumbfounded; she had shoulder length brown hair, pale skin with patches of freckles in the most random of places, and her body wasn&rsquo;t the most fit, but not too bad. The thing that I noticed first off was her eyes. Not so much that they were a beautiful color, or that the shape was unique, but she had this look in them-- this air about her that even though she was so young, her eyes said she knew so much about this world. One look from those eyes and my original goal of taking out the trash was forgotten, I could only focus on trying to think up her story.<br />	<br />After that morning it became my mission to see her during her daily jogs. I&rsquo;ll admit that I seemed a little stalkerish in the &lsquo;I can see you but you can&rsquo;t see me&rsquo; way, but really, do you have any idea how difficult it is to go up to a complete stranger and start a conversation? At least it was for me anyway, so all I could do was watch and wonder from afar. I started thinking of the most random scenarios for why a teenage girl like her would be out jogging every morning at 6 am. They started out relatively normal and then eventually blew completely out of control. <br />	At first I decided she just had to be trying to get fit. Like I said, her body wasn&rsquo;t the best I&rsquo;d ever seen. It takes a lot to give a person the kind of determination to wake up early every morning and force yourself to the edge for at least an hour. <em>She must have been dumped by her boyfriend</em>, I decided. That had to be the reason why a high school girl would be out every morning, because as everyone knows high school is a battlefield, where a word from a crush can make you soar, or make you crash to the ground.<br />	<br />Was that really it though? Don&rsquo;t girls usually gorge themselves on Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s and bitch to their girlfriends after a breakup? No. It had to be something more serious than that for her to have that look of determination on her face. It must&rsquo;ve been that someone close to her was unhealthy, and something bad happened to them because of that, so she decided to get healthy herself. <br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />	<br />After that story, she surprised me again. I guess that by this point I had been seeing her every day for about a week. That Monday morning she had a look on her face I hadn&rsquo;t seen before. There was this shine coming from her eyes, her steps were lighter, and I think I even saw her dance a couple of steps as she went along her way.  I expected her to break out into song at any moment.<br />	When she stopped in front of my yard, I thought my heart would stop.  I just knew that she had found out about my espionage, and that she was ready to confront my creepy self&hellip;but then why did she look so happy and full of life? <br /><br />Ahhh, so it was the honeysuckles.<br /><br />Not sure if I mentioned this or not, but my mom is an avid gardener. She loves planting the seeds in the barren ground, giving them lots of love and attention, and then watching something beautiful grow where there had previously been nothing.<br /><br />Lacy (which I nicknamed her because the laces in her blue Reeboks were a different pattern every other day-stars one day and then bright pink the next) hesitated by my front gate, right next to my mother&rsquo;s honeysuckles. She leaned over to smell them, and got a smile so soft on her face that I thought my first impression of her had been wrong. She gave them another small smile and then continued on her way. &lsquo;<em>She must like honeysuckles</em>&rsquo; that was the only thing I could think in the afterglow of that smile. <br /><br />The next day my thoughts were back to running amuck again. After the smiling incident yesterday, I hadn&rsquo;t been able to get her out of my mind, even throughout my everyday life. Who was she really? How was it that I had been in this same neighborhood my entire life, and had somehow missed this girl? Why was I unable to get this person I had never even met off my mind?<br /><br />At this point, I was really at wit&rsquo;s end. I started coming up with the most unbelievable stories, and I&rsquo;m too embarrassed to even go into the details of most of them. I came to the conclusion that she must be a semi-retired model. Something that happened to her, causing her to gain weight, so she had decided to take a break from the fashion industry in order to get herself together. Yes, that had to be it&hellip;<br /></span><br />*********************************************************************<br />	<br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255); "">Music has always been a sort of release for me. When Tyler Wilcox dumped me freshmen year, it was Sarah McLachlan who I ran to crying. When I turned sixteen I took my friends out for Karaoke, and nothing could ever beat singing Bohemian Rhapsody or Don&rsquo;t Stop Believen&rsquo; at the top of my lungs. When I finally got my license I discovered a new favorite thing to do: hooking my ipod up to the radio, turning the volume up as loudly as I could, and just screaming the lyrics until I grew hoarse and could barely talk. <br />	<br />If I could now, I would want to apologize to all the ex-boyfriends, friends, and family members who had to put up with my incessant singing, and terrible, terrible dancing. I don&rsquo;t know how many times I was scolded for dancing in the car when I should have been paying attention to the road, but I just couldn&rsquo;t help myself. For me, one song could change my mood drastically. Hearing Just Dance could take me to the highest of highs, and then hearing Everclear&rsquo;s Wonderful could bring me down into the pits of despair. That&rsquo;s just the way I always had been. <br />	<br />So for me, when something was wrong it was just always best to find somewhere to be alone, put on some upbeat music from my ipod, and listen to it until I forgot that something was bothering me at all. Sometimes I would wonder though, just how long can a happy song postpone unhappiness? Isn&rsquo;t that really just a shallow solution to a deeper problem? But before I knew it Adam Levine and Lasse Lindh had ushered those negative thoughts away, and I was able to return to my normally upbeat self. <br />Even after mom died, it was music that comforted me, not any of my friends. Music never ignored my messages, or broke my heart. It was something I could always depend on the fit my mood, or change it. <br /><br />I know this seems like I&rsquo;m a loner, and no one likes me, and poor pitiful me, and blah blah blah, but that really wasn&rsquo;t how it was. I had friends. I had a lot of people surrounding me, who I knew were just a phone call away. But&hellip;have you ever had something that you weren&rsquo;t able to tell people about? If you have then you know what a terrible thing it is. There&rsquo;s always this nagging thought in that back of your head, <br /><br />&lsquo;<em>What if someone finds out?</em>&rsquo;  When that thought is there, and those secrets are there, it becomes impossible for you to truly open yourself up to people. <br />	<br />Because of those reasons, and my passionate love affair with music, I decided I would take up jogging as a means of escape.</span><br />	<br />*********************************************************************<br />	<br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); "">I finally decided this was getting a little out of hand. I was thinking about this high school girl far, far too much. That sounded bad. I&rsquo;m not some old perv. or anything like that. Come to think about it, I haven&rsquo;t really told you anything about myself have I? Damn that Lacy, taking over my thoughts. Anyway, I&rsquo;m a 24 year old bachelor, and no, I&rsquo;m not an unemployed loser living off of my mother. I have a small software company, and the base of it just happens to be out of my mother&rsquo;s house. Problem? No, there shouldn&rsquo;t be. I do pretty well for myself. As for my looks, well, I&rsquo;ll leave that to your imagination, but suffice it to say, I&rsquo;ve never been called ugly.<br /> 	<br />I decided it would be better to not look for Lacy for a while. If I was meant to see her, I would see her. My body agreed. I just happened to get a terrible urge to use the bathroom just three days later, and guess what time that happened? Even my bladder was plotting against me now. <br />	<br />On my way to lie back down for the few more hours I had left to sleep, I just &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to glance out the window, and as luck would have it, I saw Lacy there. She was looking quickly to her left and right, as if to make sure there was no one around to see her. What was she going to do? It really wasn&rsquo;t like her to be this sneaky; it just didn&rsquo;t seem to fit with her personality. <br /> <br />I figured it out soon enough. SHE PICKED ONE OF MY MOM&rsquo;S HONESUCKLES!! Nah, that&rsquo;s not really a big deal. It was what she did next that really surprised me. She slipped over to our mailbox, opened it slowly while looking out for bystanders, and quickly threw something inside. I could hardly wait for her to be on her way to see what it was she had left. <br />	<br />I opened the mailbox to see a crinkled piece of notebook paper. On it, in what couldn&rsquo;t possibly be a female&rsquo;s handwriting, was a short sentence: &lsquo;<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255); "">Your flowers are very beautiful</span>.&rsquo; I&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;stop the smile from forming on my lips. What an odd girl&hellip;</span><br /><br />*********************************************************************<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255); "">My favorite time of day is right when the sun is rising. It&rsquo;s before the southern heat has truly set in, humidity hasn&rsquo;t really formed, and the clouds look so beautiful as the sun&rsquo;s first rays touch them. Being awake at this time makes you able to see things you wouldn&rsquo;t normally be able to, like a rabbit holding a buffet in the neighbor&rsquo;s yard and then hopping quickly away at the slightest sound, or the cardinals just stretching their wings to set out for the day&rsquo;s work. There&rsquo;s a silence over everything that makes it seem as if no one else is around in the world, and it&rsquo;s all yours to do whatever you please with it. This really is my favorite time of day. <br /><br />My senior year (the year I took up jogging), I found a hobby that got me some weird looks. Remember my steamy affair with music? Well, I was constantly on the hunt for new music, and I just happened to stumble upon foreign music, more notably Korean pop music. It became somewhat of an obsession. The catchy melodies and words that had no meaning to me seemed to be just what I needed. The beats gave me the energy I needed to get out of bed every morning, and gave me an easy place to go to where I didn&rsquo;t have to think about how sad the lyrics were, or the deeper meaning behind the song (not that there wasn&rsquo;t one, but I don&rsquo;t know Korean). Music really did become my best friend and lover. I told myself that it was easier this way, that every time I tried to put myself out there to someone, it only got me heartache, and that in the end they all left me. So long as I had the mind-numbing beats blaring in my ears, it was easy to not have to think about the reasons why they had left me. It was just easier that way.<br /><br />I really love flowers. They always seem so happy, and I envy that. There&rsquo;s no fa&ccedil;ade with flowers, just a sweet scent and a pretty appearance. I always wished that people could be as simple and straightforward as flowers. A rose has such a beautiful appearance, and even though it has thorns, they&rsquo;re on the outside, visible to anyone who is willing to take a second to look at them. <br /><br />My favorite flower, though, is the honeysuckle. I always know when spring has arrived because the smells of honeysuckles seem to be everywhere. It instantly makes me feel better, and clears away any cobwebs I may have lingering in my head. I&rsquo;m thankful to the neighbor down the street who grows honeysuckle along her fence. No matter how sad I am, when I round that corner and that scent invades my nostrils, my spirits are instantly lifted. Even if I want to be dreary and depressed, for that one moment in time, I&rsquo;m able to be carefree, and smile as if nothing in the world is wrong. I really was grateful to that neighbor. I even wrote her a note once complimenting her flowers. Imagine if she had seen me! I would&rsquo;ve had to find another jogging route, and then I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten to see my sweets, then the jogging wouldn&rsquo;t have been as effective as it was. But no matter how much of a distraction those small things could be, I would always have to come back to reality, and back to my life. The real world isn&rsquo;t made up of honeysuckles and bubbly melodies. Facing that proved to be one of the most heart wrenching experiences of my life.</span><br /><br />*********************************************************************<br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ""><br />After the note incident, I left it up to fate to decide if I would see Lacy again. On the days when I would wake up early enough to catch a glimpse of her, I would make bets with myself; I guess you could call them dares. Sometimes they would be small things like if she lands on her left foot in front of the mailbox then I would write her a reply and leave it by the honeysuckles. Other times it would be things I could only dream about doing and never muster up the courage for: If she&rsquo;s wearing a red scrunchie I&rsquo;ll introduce myself to her tomorrow. Of course, she seemed to be completely adverse to red hairbows, even a man as clueless as me could tell that, thus the wager really had no real risk. <br /><br />One thing never ceased to amaze me though: her facial expressions had the power to influence my entire day. When she would flash that angelic smile to the honeysuckles, I knew it was going to be a great day for me, yet on certain days she would show a completely different expression. Those days, no matter how hard she tried to hold them back, the tears would somehow plot their escape from her eyes, before she quickly wiped them away and sucked back her sobs. <br /><br />Those were my worst days. How much did I wish I could gather my courage up to simply ask her if something was wrong? I wished I could let her know there was someone there who worried about her, and wished that she could keep her beautiful smile always. Those days, I really hated myself for being such a coward.</span><br /><br />*********************************************************************<br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 255); ""><br />I wonder how many people have thought <em>&lsquo;I would kill myself if I weren&rsquo;t so afraid of going to Hell</em>&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s not that I grew up in a really religious family; it actually couldn&rsquo;t have been farther from that. But I&rsquo;ll never forget the lessons I learned in bible school back when I still thought the world was just, and that the good were rewarded. When I think back on the little girl I used to be, tears readily spring to my eyes. A child&rsquo;s innocence is so precious, and is most oftentimes given up far too quickly in this world we live in. <br /><br />Hope is sometimes like grasping at straws, for me at least. I always tried to look on the bright side, that even though it was so terrible at home, no one knew that at school, no one really knew anything about me. What a sad thing to have to face. How can a person go through this life without making connections with other people? Isn&rsquo;t that generally the thing that separates human beings from beasts? How had I become a person who was so expendable to other people? <br /><br />I would always shoo those thoughts away quickly, because if not then I would cry for hours at a time with &lsquo;<em>What&rsquo;s the point?!</em>&rsquo; repeating like a rolling marquee over and over in my head. <br /><br />Jogging doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working so well anymore, the thoughts even seem to invade when I try to push myself to the point of not being able to breathe. Sorry my love, my music, for not appreciating you more, and for so easily being able to shove you aside and stay stuck inside my own head. You really were the only thing that&rsquo;s kept me going on and distracting me for so long. How terribly sad is a life when something smaller than a human hand made of plastic and metal, and holding 8Gb worth of memories, joy, sadness, and distraction is the best friend a person has in the world&mdash;the only thing to look forward to every day. Isn&rsquo;t that just too sad?</span><br /><br />*********************************************************************    <br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); "">I didn&rsquo;t see Lacy anymore after the honeysuckles withered. She always remained in a box in the storage of my mind, a nagging question mark and a constant reminder of how big a regret cowardice could become. Did she start taking a different jogging route? Did her family move? Did she reach her quota and decide to return to the fashion industry? Had the steel-gazed, angelic-smiling people of her planet decided they needed their freckle faced queen back, so they forced her to return immediately? Would she be back with the honeysuckles?&nbsp;No, the truth is I never found out what happened to Lacy, I never even found out what her real name was. <br /><br />I still wonder about her sometimes. I wonder what could make her smile like an innocent child one day, and then what could make her cry as if she had all the sadness of the world on her shoulders the next. I still haven&rsquo;t been able to guess what kind of music could&rsquo;ve possibly flowed from those silly pink headphones into her ears. The game isn&rsquo;t fun anymore...</span></lj-cut>"

"event","&nbsp;<br />Toni could only thank her lucky stars that the CEO didn&rsquo;t need any last minute translating from her, and that she didn&rsquo;t have to come face to face with Taemin again. She and Sarah had arrived at the venue a little over an hour ago, and Toni was stunned silent by the amount of people there. She didn&rsquo;t know that Korean music, or culture for that matter, was that popular in America. Granted, most of the people in attendance were Asian, but still, this was America, and for her, finding another Koreaboo was a rare thing.<br /><br />Once they were finally at their seats, Toni had time to actually breathe and take in her surroundings. She was surrounded by squealing fangirls on all sides, who could barely contain their excitement over finally getting to see their oppas up close. She smiled to herself, thinking how jealous they would probably be if they knew that just hours earlier she had seen their oppa in a position that they could only dream about. <br /><br />She had to stop herself from smacking her face. This was not a laughing matter!! She lowered her eyes and proceeded to get lost in her thoughts until the deafening cheers of the crowd snapped her back to reality.<br /><br />The concert went by in a rush of crazy screams and rhythmic music that, even though she didn&rsquo;t know any of it, she couldn&rsquo;t help but move along to. Finally the lights lowered and five forms walked out on the stage. From the reaction of those around her, Toni knew that this group must be extremely popular. <br /><br />Her heart shuddered when she saw that familiar tuft of hair come walking towards her. She wanted to sink down into her seat so that she wouldn&rsquo;t be spotted, but at the same time she wanted to stand up and scream his name along with the rest of the fangirls to try to somehow get his attention.<br /><br />The lights rose, and she was once again left at a loss of words when faced with Taemin&rsquo;s beauty. She wasn&rsquo;t close enough that she was directly in front of him, but if he looked out at the audience at the right moment and in the right direction, he would definitely be able to see her. <br /><br />Looking at him now, Toni could only remember the previous night. She could still feel his breath on her neck, and the way that his hands glided down her arms as his hips slid perfectly against her, moving in time with the music. She knew from the little time she had seen of his dancing last night that he knew what he was doing, but this&hellip;this was totally different. As soon as the music started playing, Taemin seemed like a different person. He raised his head up, looked directly at her, and his gaze sent chills all throughout her body. Her breath caught, and she knew that she had been spotted. She didn&rsquo;t have time to bask in the whirlwind of happiness and fear her body was throwing at her, because her thoughts were interrupted by a hard elbow to her ribs from her cousin.<br /><br />&lsquo;That&rsquo;s him right, right, right?!?! The one on the computer?!?! OH MY GOD!! HE&rsquo;S EVEN BETTER IN REAL LIFE!!!&rsquo; She screamed right in Toni&rsquo;s ear. &lsquo;OMG IS HE LOOKING AT US?!?! He is!!!&rsquo; Sarah confirmed what Toni had been thinking, and probably what all the other women around them had been thinking as well. Toni chewed on her lip and decided that she would stop running away. This wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person she was, so why should she act this way over someone she barely knows? <br /><br />She looked up again at where his stare was still located. She smirked to herself and glared right back at him. Her eyes met his, and even though he tried to hide it, Toni noticed the small smile that he stopped from forming on the sides of his lips. He didn&rsquo;t try to hide his wink though, knowing it would drive his fans crazy, and knowing that she knew it was meant just for her.  Toni subconsciously licked her lips, her carnal desires showing themselves promptly before her brain had time to scream about how wrong it was.  The only thing she could do was sit back, grit her teeth, and wait until the concert was over and she would no longer have to see that sweetest of forbidden fruits.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The concert was over, and Toni could finally breathe again. She thought her heart was going to go in a state of shock from how many times it had stopped and raced over the last two days, and she was more than happy that she would be returning to her peaceful little life&hellip;then she felt her phone vibrate against her thigh. <br /><br />She heaved a heavy sigh when she saw who it was from. Mr. CEO himself had called her up to tell her about another after party they were having, except this time a select few fans were allowed to come, and she would be allowed to bring her cousin along. Between his insistence that she come, and her cousin&rsquo;s whining about wanting to go meet all the pretty boys, Toni wanted to rip her hair out in frustration. Why couldn&rsquo;t they just understand that there was obviously a reason she was so reluctant? Who in their right mind would pass up an opportunity to party it up with celebrities? Mistaking her reluctance for shyness, they both kept pressing her until she felt like turning them down would have made her out to be a villain. She gulped down any remaining qualms she had about seeing Taemin again, determining herself to set him straight if he tried anything tonight, and she and Sarah made their way to the same venue where the party had been hosted the previous night.<br /><br />The only difference between last night and tonight was the people in attendance. The SM artists were all keeping to themselves, while the fans were all huddled nervously together speaking in whispers and giggles about being in the same room as their idols. <br /><br />Toni walked confidently over to the CEO, her strides quick, her cousin having trouble keeping up with her. Toni decided she was going to chitchat with him for a little while, sip on a daiquiri, and get the hell out of there as soon as she could. She limited herself to that one drink, because in no way did she want a repeat of last night.<br /><br />She did a quick run through of the room, and noted that luckily Taemin was nowhere to be found. The CEO noticed her scanning, and seemed to know what she was looking for. He chuckled. <br /><br />&lsquo;Ah, since we brought in people from the outside tonight, I thought it was best if all our young ones went to bed early tonight. Your country seems really strict about underage people being in places like this, and a scandal is the last thing any of us need,&rsquo; he said in a lighthearted tone, but ending in a way that made Toni feel as though the words were aimed particularly at her. She shifted her eyes and gave him a slight nod. He smiled back at her, the air returning to a normal one, and him returning to his cheerful self.   &lsquo;I have to go talk to this person over here, would you mind keeping him company for me while I&rsquo;m gone?&rsquo; He asked Toni, pointed at a slouched over figure at his table. She slowly nodded her head yes and took his seat at the table.<br /><br />She looked around quickly, trying to locate her long lost cousin. She spotted her in a corner, chatting it up with a couple of cuties. Sarah shot her a smile, letting her know just how excited she was to be there, and she wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near being ready to leave yet. Toni sighed and rolled her eyes over to the mass of flesh that was lying on the table opposite her. <br /><br />The man was breathing in a steady rhythm, his back heaving with each heavy intake of breath. He was asleep. Toni covered her eyes quickly, rubbing them in a fast pace. How is it that she always ended up in these weird situations? She lowered her head, sighing and resigning herself to the fact that bad things were just going to follow her wherever she went. <br /><br />She poked the man on the shoulder gently. No response. She poked a little harder and gave a stern &lsquo;Ahjusshi.&rsquo; No response. &lsquo;Ahjusshi, wake up!&rsquo;<br /><br />The figure slowly began to stir, annoyed that his sleep had been interrupted. &lsquo;Ahjusshi?! Who the hell is an ahjusshi?!&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni gasped at the voice that growled out those angry words, and at the bloodshot eyes that slowly opened to see their offender. Onew looked confused for a moment, and then slowly chuckled when that moment of realization finally occurred. A sarcastic smile formed on his lips and he responded to Toni&rsquo;s call. &lsquo;<em>Ahjusshi~ Ahjusshi~</em>&hellip;..sounding so innocent. Please, you&rsquo;re about as innocent as I am.&rsquo; <br /><br />Toni was taken aback by how forward he was. Yes, she had seen him creeping into his hotel room as she had been creeping out of it, but she really hadn&rsquo;t given it any other thought than that.<em> &lsquo;So was that what he was talking about this morning? That because he had been out all night doing something he shouldn&rsquo;t have been doing, he wouldn&rsquo;t tell on me for doing the same?&rsquo;</em> The gears in Toni&rsquo;s head began working, and she started to reevaluate what she had first thought of this man. She had seen his warm smile and his cheerful eyes, and had assumed that he was what everyone thought Taemin was. <br /><br />&lsquo;Alright, you don&rsquo;t have to be a dick about it. The CEO asked me to keep you company so I was just trying to make sure you were alright.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh? Really? Keep me company? I&rsquo;ll agree, but only if it&rsquo;s the same way you kept Taemin company last night,&rsquo; he fired back.<br /><br />Toni&rsquo;s eyes opened as wide as her mouth, and she couldn&rsquo;t stop the deep flush that spread its way from her chest to her cheeks. She was at a complete loss for what to say, and her brain that was always ready with a smart quip had been fried.<br /><br />He giggled, the kind of silly giggle that only a drunk man can release, and leered at her. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t ask you to really do that. No one touches anything that belongs to our <em>precious</em> Taeminnie,&rsquo; he spat out.<br /><br />He laid his head back down on the table and let out a huge groan. Toni felt a pang of sadness for the man sprawled in front of her. She didn&rsquo;t know where it sprang from, but she just knew that looking at him, she suddenly felt sad.<br /><br />&lsquo;Alright Onew-ssi, I&rsquo;ll help you up to your room. You seem like you&rsquo;ve had enough tonight.&rsquo; She went to his side and pulled a heavy arm over her shoulder, heaving most of his weight up as she did so. Onew got shaken up by how quick and decided her movements were. He turned his head to the side. He wasn&rsquo;t as drunk as she thought he was, but seeing her reactions and how frustrated he could make her was something Onew enjoyed immensely. She had some of the cutest he had seen from any of the others he had played with, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but think that maybe this one in particular would be a lot of fun to tease. He let her lead him out to the elevators, the situation from the night before somehow slightly reversed. He leaned on her probably a little more than he should have in the elevator, and buried himself in the scent of flowers that seemed to come from her. He couldn&rsquo;t place what scent it was, but it was so familiar and yet so distant.<br /><br />&lsquo;Aish, really?&rsquo; Toni grumbled, annoyed at the man that she was practically dragging down the hallway. She turned her head a little and caught him with a nostalgic grin on his face, his eyes half open in a sign that he was just letting her do what she please. She let out an indignant gasp, and released him right where they stood. <br /><br />&lsquo;Ta ta ta ta,&rsquo; Onew ticked out, rubbing his head that had just been hit against the wall, and staring after Toni, who had just stomped the rest of the way down the hallway. She knocked loudly on the door, and was more than a little surprised when Taemin was the one that answered. In her haste and her anger, she had forgotten that Onew was rooming with Taemin, but one look down the hallway reminded her of why she had made the trip in the first place.<br /><br />&lsquo;Can you get that&hellip;that&hellip;that thing back into your room please?&rsquo; She pointed down the hallway to where Onew continued to play the clueless drunkard. &lsquo;Ahhh, jinjja, this is what I get for trying to be a good person.&rsquo; She rubbed at her temples and made her way back down to Onew. She looked back expectantly at Taemin who was still standing in the doorway, paralyzed at the ludicrous scene that had somehow developed in front of him. &lsquo;Well, are you going to help or aren&rsquo;t you?! He&rsquo;s really heavy!&rsquo; She shouted down, making sure she got that weight dig in on the &lsquo;sleeping&rsquo; Onew. Taemin came back to reality and rushed down to grab onto Onew&rsquo;s other side, taking most of the weight upon himself. Toni noted how even though he looked like he could barely support his own weight; he was a lot stronger than he looked.<br /><br />Toni helped them to the door, made sure they made it through, and then turned on her heels and rushed off in the opposite direction. Taemin shrugged Onew off, nearly knocking him to the floor, but Onew&rsquo;s many trips had taught him how to catch himself well. Taemin rushed out after Toni, not paying any attention to his hyung who had obviously been faking his slumber for unknown reason.<br /><br />&lsquo;Toni,&rsquo; she heard call out from behind her. She didn&rsquo;t respond, hoping he would take the hint. &lsquo;Toni. Toni.&rsquo; <em>Please, please take the hint</em>. &lsquo;NOONA!&rsquo; At that Toni turned around to face him, ready to give him an earful, but found instead that he had advanced right upon her. In her concentration on willing the elevator to come faster, she had miscalculated the distance from one end of the hallway to the other, and it took Taemin even less time in his rush. <br /><br />&lsquo;You, you don&rsquo;t know me well enough to call me noona yet.&rsquo; Even though she didn&rsquo;t know anything about Kpop, she knew what it meant when someone younger called someone older than them that.<br /><br />Taemin grinned impishly. &lsquo;Well, I think I got to know you pretty well, noona,&rsquo; he said, tracing his fingers down her back. She arched suddenly, and a rebellious moan escaped from her lips. Damn it. He really did know her weak spots. How many men knew that her back was the most sensitive part of her body, and that just a gentle touch could drive her over the edge?<br /><br />He grinned even wider, and this made her even angrier. &lsquo;Taemin, please refrain from doing things like this in the future. Last night&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t have happened. If I had known that you were 17, and just how many fans you had, it was something I would never have let happen. Doing things like this in public, it can only lead to bad things. I&rsquo;m sure your boss and your fans wouldn&rsquo;t be happy about knowing what happened.&rsquo;<br /><br />Taemin stepped back, the grin leaving his face as though she had slapped it off.<em> &lsquo;Ah, maybe I was a little harsh&hellip;he&rsquo;s still a kid after all&hellip;&rsquo;</em><br /><br />&lsquo;Tae-&lsquo; She was cut short by Taemin leaning forward and giving her a gentle kiss on the side of her mouth. He made sure he wasn&rsquo;t directly on her lips, but just close enough that his lips slightly brushed hers. She was still standing there, mouth hanging open, the &ndash;min lost somewhere in the midst of the bold act Taemin had just done. <br /><br />&lsquo;Noona, you look really pretty. Even in jeans.&rsquo; He fingered a lock of her brown curls before softly bringing it to his lips and kissing it. He gave her a slight wink before rushing back down the hallway to finally take care of his hyung. Toni just stood there, mouth still agape, blushing from somewhere deep inside her, and hating that this seventeen year old boy could ruffle her up so much that she had no idea what to do with herself. <br /><br />Her redemption lay in the elevator from the Stone Age that finally dinged it&rsquo;s arrival and opened it&rsquo;s waiting doors for her to escape into. She saw her reflection mirrored in the metal door, and couldn&rsquo;t believe how visibly flustered she looked. She wondered about the face she had made when Taemin had kissed her, and remembering back on it only helped to make her blush grow deeper. She could only count down the floors until she reached the first one and could grab her cousin, even if she protested, and get away from these feelings that shouldn&rsquo;t be growing inside of her.<br /><br />When Taemin opened the door to his room, he was greeted by Onew standing in the door way, arms crossed, a menacing look on his face.<br />&lsquo;Ah hyung, you&rsquo;re awake? I thought you might be.&rsquo; He chuckled. He knew it was a habit of his hyung&rsquo;s to pretend to be sleeping or drunk so that he could hear and see how other people reacted to him. Onew&rsquo;s gaze never wavered, and Taemin gave him a quizzical look. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo;<br /><br />Onew just stood there biting his tongue and trying to fight back his anger that threatened to spill forth. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s something that pisses me off more than anything&mdash;when people have done something wrong and they pretend to play innocent. Did you forget Taeminnie? Your aegyo maknae act doesn&rsquo;t work on me.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Hyung, are you sure you&rsquo;re not drunk? Right now you&rsquo;re talking nonsense.&rsquo; He opened his eyes wider, putting on his most innocent act for his hyung. Onew&rsquo;s rage bubbled inside of him.<br /><br />&lsquo;Really now? So you don&rsquo;t remember last night, when Toni came in, me saying I wanted her? This just conveniently slipped your mind?&rsquo;<br /><br />Taemin just smiled at his hyung. He patted him on his shoulder as he walked over to his bed to lie back down. &lsquo;Really Onew hyung, all you did was say it before I could get it out. How can I help it if the one she decided she wanted wasn&rsquo;t you, but me?&rsquo; He sang playfully, letting his words reverberate through the room before their impact finally settled on Onew. He clenched his fists tightly, and it took everything in him to not hit the light haired demon. He decided it was a better use of his time to swallow back his anger and frustration and try to force himself to sleep. However, when his head hit the pillow, all he could think about was that flowery scent that seemed to have invaded his very core. He finally placed what the flower was: honeysuckle. &lsquo;<em>Damn it,</em>&rsquo; was his last thought before he finally drifted off to sleep.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />All hail Taemin, the king of pissing people off!!<br />I'm going to go ahead and rate it a little higher, mostly bc of language...sorry, I have a mouth like a sailor XP"

"event","&nbsp;&lsquo;Ughhhh.&rsquo; Toni groaned, the sun&rsquo;s rays prying her eyes open. She tugged the covers over her head, desperately clinging to those precious last minutes of sleep before she had to wake up and face another day. She closed her eyes and a small smile formed on her lips. She&rsquo;d had a <em>really</em> good dream last night, one that she wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to wake up from. She squealed into a fistful of sheet, and snuggled down deeper into the warm cave of blanket, closing her eyes tight, slinging her leg over the legs that were next to her.<br /><br />&lsquo;<em>Wait&hellip;&hellip;.WHAT?!</em>&rsquo; Her eyes snapped open. <em>&lsquo;LEGS?! WHY ARE THERE LEGS IN BED WITH ME?!</em>&rsquo; Her inner thoughts screamed. She sat up abruptly, her head spinning, fuzzy with memories of the night before.<br /><br />She had blurred visions of skin on skin, fervent, breathless kisses, and something that definitely shouldn&rsquo;t have happened. She opened her eyes and looked at the person who the legs belonged to. If she thought he had been good looking last night, it was nothing compared to this morning. He was lying on his stomach, head facing her, with such a blissful look on his face that it was almost angelic. Toni&rsquo;s heart stopped, and everything in her body screamed to just lay back under the covers, to hug as close to his warm body as she could. In her mind she knew that she needed to leave before he woke up and things got awkward, or before she gave into the temptation to just burrow into his arms and stay there forever, but Taemin&rsquo;s naked shoulders did absolutely nothing to help her inner struggle. <br /><br />&lsquo;<em>OHGODOHGODOHGODOHGOD!!!</em>&rsquo; She panicked. &lsquo;<em>I seriously did not just sleep with this. Oh God! What if my boss finds out?! I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll tell the company and I&rsquo;ll get fired and I won&rsquo;t be able to find a job and I can&rsquo;t help my cousin and we&rsquo;ll starve to death!</em>&rsquo; Her thoughts raced out of control, coming up with impossible scenarios and fearing the worst happening, as she always did.<br /><br />She was shaken out of her daydreams in the form of a moan from Taemin. He groaned once before rolling over and turning his back to her. Toni&rsquo;s heart dropped to her stomach from the shock it gave her, and she took that as her cue to gtfo. She quickly put her dress on and shoved her feet into those freaking heels, before picking up the rest of her things, what little dignity she had remaining, and fleeing the scene of the crime. <br /><br />She opened the door so painfully slow, each creak sounding like a blaring alarm. She finally got the thing opened enough for her to slip out, and she tiptoed her way through the crack, looking at the sleeping form lying on the bed one final time before pulling the door shut with a slight &lsquo;click&rsquo;.<br /><br />She breathed a sigh of relief at making it out alive, only to turn around and nearly scream out loud. Onew must have known she was about to scream, because his hand quickly cupped over her mouth and silenced her, instantly calming her down when she saw who it was. He brought a finger to his mouth, telling her she needed to be quiet and he would remove his hand. She nodded her head quickly showing her understanding. He removed his hand and once again shh&rsquo;d her. <br /><br />Onew looked over her disheveled appearance and scoffed at her, a smirk making its way to his lips as he studied her from top to bottom. Her hair was a train wreck, and that&rsquo;s putting it nicely. Her dress had been put on backwards in her haste to get it on, and she&rsquo;d lost all hope of finding her stockings. Last night&rsquo;s makeup looked like last night&rsquo;s makeup, and Toni could only bite her lip and cower in shame as Onew eyed her over. His tongue flicked out quickly between his lips, his eyes filled with something Toni couldn&rsquo;t quite identify, and she wasn&rsquo;t sure she wanted to. He leaned towards her, pushing her back into the door, and whispered in her ear, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t tell if you won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni felt her face burn red. Onew backed up, holding his arm out to make way for her to finish her disappearing act. She turned around to watch him enter the room, her confusion getting the best of her embarrassment. <em>&lsquo;What was THAT??</em><em>&rsquo;</em> She could only shake her head to try to clear her thoughts as she went to her long lost room to make herself look a little presentable before trying to face civilized company.<br /><br />Toni left the hotel to return to the comfort of her apartment. She knew she was supposed to be at the hotel for conveniences&rsquo; sake, but honestly, right now she just needed to be somewhere comfortable to come to terms with what had just happened.<br /><br />Coming to terms did not happen, however, and all Toni could do was watch as Taemin&rsquo;s face continually swam in front of her eyes. It was all she could do to keep herself sitting still and not go absolutely insane from memories of the night before that kept trying to resurface no matter how hard she shoved them back.<br /><br />Finally, she&rsquo;d had enough and she decided that she just had to know more about this guy who had seemed to invade her mind. She dragged herself over to her laptop, hating that she was actually going to google this guy and that she had absolutely no self control. <br />As soon as the search was brought up, Toni was again stunned by his beauty. Then her eyes caught sight of something else. <strong>DOB: July18,1993</strong>. '<em>1993? 1993?! 1993?!?!? TAEMIN IS 17?!?'</em> Toni could only lower her face into her hands, closing her eyes tight and groaning regretfully over and over again. '<em>17?! OH GOD! I&rsquo;m a rapist! I could go to jail. What do I do?! I know, never drink again, dumbass.'</em> Toni cursed herself.<br /><br />She peeked through the small space between her fingers and snuck another look at Taemin. She caught herself and quickly gave herself a few hits on the head.<em> &lsquo;IDIOT! Look what you just found out! It doesn&rsquo;t matter how good looking he is! It&rsquo;s illegal! I-L-L-E-G-A-L!&rsquo;</em><br /><br />Toni was so caught up in the heated argument she was having with herself that she didn&rsquo;t notice her cousin came home. Her cousin noticed this, and being the fox she was, snuck up behind Toni and got a good look at what was on her screen.<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s cute!!&rsquo; she exclaimed in Toni&rsquo;s ear, causing her to jump, her automatic reaction to slam the screen shut. <br /><br />&lsquo;Sarah! I didn&rsquo;t think you were going to be home until 4.&rsquo; Toni said, as normally as she could, trying to hide any traces of guilt from her voice.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ummm, are you okay sweetie? Look at what time it is.&rsquo; Toni&rsquo;s eyes shifted to the clock on the wall and she was shocked to see that it was 3:30. Had she really been zoning out for that long?! She chewed on her bottom lip nervously before realizing what time it was.<br /><br />&lsquo;You&rsquo;re still home early. What&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; Sarah smiled, excitement bubbling over to where she just wanted to spill out everything right there.<br />&lsquo;Okay, I know how much you like watching those Korean shows and movies and stuff, so I, being the amazing, perfect cousin that I am, decided to surprise you. TA-DAH!!!&rsquo; She exclaimed, pulling out two pieces of paper from behind her back. Toni squinted to try to figure out what her cousin was holding, and could see just enough to tell they were concert tickets. <br /><br />&lsquo;I know how you&rsquo;re into all that Korean stuff, so I thought I would surprise you with an early birthday present. I bought the best ones there were, so we&rsquo;re going to be right up front. Ohhhhh, was that guy you were just looking at a singer? Did you meet him??? Will he be there tonight?!?!&rsquo; Her cousin bombarded her, not even bothering to contain her excitement. Toni saw where she got her rambling from now&hellip;must be a family trait, but one of the favorites she&rsquo;d ever gotten.<br /><br />&lsquo;Mmm,&rsquo; Toni murmured. She brought her knees up to her chin and laid her head down on them. She sighed a heavy sigh and thought about how she would have to see Taemin again later that night.<br /><br />&lsquo;HEY!&rsquo; Sarah screamed in her ear. &lsquo;These were really expensive. How about a thank you Sarah? Can I get a little excitement? A little OHMYGODIGETTOBESURROUNDEDBYHOTGUYSALLINMYFACETONIGHT?!?!&rsquo; Sarah giggled, and as always it was an infectious one, one that couldn&rsquo;t help but make Toni laugh along. She could pretend to be excited about tonight, at least for her cousin&rsquo;s sake. She didn&rsquo;t want her to know about the knots that formed in her stomach at just the thought of facing the man she had so blatantly ran from that very morning.<br />&lsquo;Alright, should be fun. Now&hellip;what are we going to wear?!&rsquo;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Sorry it's so short and that it took so long to post up. I had serious problem debating about a sex scene or not, and for my sanity's sake I decided to cut it out. I might write it later as an extra, or as a flashback, but right now...I just can't. OTL<br />Also, going to study up some on what SM Town was like, and then I'll post up the next chapter ^^ Hope you like it, even though it is super short.<br />"

"event","&nbsp;&lsquo;What&rsquo;d you think?&rsquo; Taemin asked, panting, when he finally made his way back to her. The cocky smile on his face let her know that he knew exactly how amazing he was, and for some reason that just rubbed her the wrong way.<br /><br />&lsquo;Meh, I&rsquo;ve seen better.&rsquo; She said, so nonchalantly that he could only believe her.  Toni couldn&rsquo;t help but feel more than a little pleased when she noticed how her words had dampened his mood. She couldn&rsquo;t believe that something she had said affected this heavenly creature so much. She tried her hardest to hide a small giggle as she gently lifted up his chin.<br /><br />&lsquo;I was kidding. You don&rsquo;t have to ask me, you know how amazing you are. You&rsquo;re like a different person when you&rsquo;re dancing. You just exude charisma.&rsquo; He brightened up at her words, and seeing that smile again, Toni had to think for a second to remember how to breathe. <br /><br /><em>I need another drink.</em> That thought kept repeating over and over. Toni had never met anyone so good looking in her life, and even though she liked to play it cool and act like she knew all there was to know about men, the truth of the matter was that inside she still had that fourteen year old girl who was afraid that no matter what she did, it wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough to make someone want her. Alcohol helped act as a buffer and shoved those thoughts into the deepest recesses of her mind.  <br /><br />Two more margaritas later and all those fears had vanished into thin air. She found it so much easier to dance with Taemin now, grinding in places that earlier she would have never had the nerve to. She raised her arms above her head and gently caressed down his neck. She felt him shiver, and found this to be the funniest thing she&rsquo;d seen all night.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she sighed, knowing at this point that she&rsquo;d had too much to drink. She felt her face gradually growing numb, and that was always how she knew that she should cut back on the drinking. She broke from Taemin&rsquo;s arms as the song ended and wobbly made her way over to where her bag was. She spotted the CEO, and a silly smile crossed her face.<br /><br />&lsquo;Thank you so so so so so SO much for tonight Mr. CEO chairman man! I think I had better get going though, I need sleep. Ah, what was my room number? Ehhhhhhh, I&rsquo;ll find it. Ya! If you need anything you know where I am. Of course you know where I am, you bought the room! Not bought, rented!&rsquo; She laughed loudly. She was a hilarious drunk. She turned to face Taemin who had followed quickly after her when she left the dance floor. &lsquo;You&hellip;.you&hellip;.&rsquo; she stammered. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a cute kid.&rsquo; She burst out laughing, patting Taemin&rsquo;s cheek haphazardly. &lsquo;Aigoo, it&rsquo;s warm in here,&rsquo; were her parting words as she stumbled out of the room and started heading out into the hotel. Taemin&rsquo;s eyes followed her, his brows furrowed together with worry and annoyance at his crushed pride from being called a &lsquo;cute kid&rsquo; by the one person he wanted to hear anything BUT that from.<br /><br />Our lovely CEO saw Temin&rsquo;s look and chimed in with a stern &lsquo;Taemin, I think you should make sure she makes it back to her room alright. She looks like she&rsquo;s in no state to find it herself, and I&rsquo;m afraid of what may happen if she&rsquo;s left to wander around alone.&rsquo; Taemin nodded and then rushed out after his partner. <br /><br />Upon returning to his seat, Onew looked at the CEO with an amused expression. &lsquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s such a good idea? You know how Taemin can get, especially when it comes to the reluctant noonas.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Eh, he&rsquo;s young. Let him have his fun while he still can before the public eye gets turned on his every move.&rsquo; Onew frowned and grumbled a little under his breath about him not being allowed fun, making sure it wasn&rsquo;t loud enough to be heard because everyone knew the CEO&rsquo;s word was law. <br /><br />Taemin finally caught up to Toni in the hallway, finding her leaning against the wall. He approached her cautiously, not sure what was wrong, until he was standing in front of her. He noticed her eyes were closed, and he let out a slow &lsquo;Toni-shi?&rsquo; Her eyes popped open quickly, and it made him jump back. She snorted a laugh and then remembered why she had been standing there in the first place.<br /><br />She slumped down suddenly, crouching, her arms wrapped around her legs, and tears filled her eyes. Taemin couldn&rsquo;t possibly fathom what had happened all of a sudden to make her cry, so all he could do was lean down to where he was eye level with her and ask her what it was that had made her burst out in tears.<br /><br />Toni looked into his beautiful brown eyes and tried to suck back her sobs, the tears eventually ciphering off into sniffles. &lsquo;I just&hellip;I really wanted to make a good impression, and I know I looked like a complete idiot in front of your boss. But I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I was just so nervous and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do&hellip;&rsquo; she whined. <br /><br />&lsquo;Why were you so nervous?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;As if you don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; She wailed. &lsquo;Look at you! Who wouldn&rsquo;t be nervous?&rsquo;<br /><br />He chuckled. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Our boss has a weak spot for pretty women who can&rsquo;t hold their liquor.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;R-really?&rsquo; She looked up at him, eyes shining brightly with hope, her tear stained cheeks slightly flushed, and Taemin couldn&rsquo;t help himself any more. He leaned forward and lightly pressed his lips against Toni&rsquo;s. She sat there for a second, blinking quickly, not sure if that had actually happened, or if the alcohol had started messing with more than just her emotions.<br /><br />Not waiting for her mind to sort it out, she stood up abruptly, almost tumbling over and forcing herself to spill into Taemin&rsquo;s arms. She slowly raised her head, her heart beating faster as she got closer to that face that just seemed to be her weakness. This time it was her lips who sought his out. They touched hesitantly, quivering, not sure that was what she should be doing, not sure if she would regret her hastiness five minutes from now, but knowing that if she didn&rsquo;t see if something was there she would hate herself.<br /><br />She broke from his embrace again, stunned by her rashness. She wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person to meet someone and instantly go to kissing. She let out a strained breath, the silence between them thick enough to cut. <br /><br />&lsquo;Um, I think my room is on the 8th floor? Yeah&hellip;I think I should head up there.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Mine is on the same floor. I want to make sure you get there alright.&rsquo; He said, his voice coming out a pitch lower than what she had been used to that night. She looked at his profile, and could see that he was visibly shaken from what she had just done. For some unknown reason, she loved knowing that he was just as conflicted as she was.<br /><br />They made their way to the elevator, him wondering why this hotel had the slowest elevator in history and her cursing her decision to wear four inch heels and then down margaritas. <br /><br />When they finally made it up to their floor, Toni just stood there bewildered, forgetting where her room was that she had just visited earlier that day. Taemin pretty much guessed what had happened, so while she stood there trying to clear her mind enough to think about what she could do in this situation, he grabbed her hand and led her down the right side of the hallway. &lsquo;Oh? You know where my room is?&rsquo; She asked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad one of us does~&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;No, but I know where my room is.&rsquo; He put his card in the door. &lsquo;And I can&rsquo;t just leave you sitting out here for something to happen until you remember which room is yours.&rsquo; The green light flashed, and the beep that followed worked as a trigger in Toni&rsquo;s head. She realized what was about to happen, that she was about to be led into the room of this beautiful stranger whom she had just subconsciously kissed minutes earlier. She bit down on her lip, afraid of what might happen if she crossed the threshold into his room and into a situation she was completely unfamiliar with.<br /><br />Taemin saw her hesitation and a smirk slowly made its way across his face. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t bite&hellip;.unless you&rsquo;re into that&hellip;&rsquo;<br /><br />Something inside Toni snapped at those sexily uttered words, and it took every ounce of restraint she had in her to not attack him right there in the hallway. Instead, she pushed him on in the room, shutting the door behind her. <br /><br />Her forwardness took him by surprise. Usually when he found himself in this situation, he had to take the lead. Women always only saw him as the adorable maknae, someone they were afraid was too pure, and they didn&rsquo;t want to be the one to taint him. They didn&rsquo;t know that he had been tainted long ago until they came face to face with it in the form of him playing his seduction game. This woman was different. Taemin wasn&rsquo;t chasing after her, and she wasn&rsquo;t chasing after him. They both wanted each other, plain and simple. He saw it written all over her face the second their eyes met, that this is where they were heading, and he loved that.<br /><br />Toni sat down on the edge of one of the double beds, crossing her legs, just one thought in her mind: <em>Eh, what the hell. He&rsquo;s gorgeous.</em> <br />She closed her eyes and tilted her head back, motioning for him to come over. He took the hint and descended on her. <br /> <br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Alright, I might come back and add the next part (wink, wink) to this one, or I may just make another entry altogether...I haven't decided yet. I guess we'll see when I finally get the inspiration~"

"event","&nbsp;&lsquo;Ugh,&rsquo; Toni sighed, wiping her forehead. Her body wasn&rsquo;t used to the humid California weather, and it demonstrated this through the tiny beads of sweat that had begun to cluster on her forehead and all the places where skin touched skin. The khaki capris and light tee she had decided to don just weren&rsquo;t cutting it, and she was almost at her wits end about the mess of tangled curls that was her hair.<br /><br />&lsquo;<em>How can anyone actually </em>like<em> this weather</em>?&rsquo;  she grumbled to herself, knowing full well it had been her decision to uproot herself from her comfortable Kentucky life and drag herself out to this humid hell they called LA. She sighed a final time, wiped her forehead off once more, and then began making her way inside the crowded airport.<br /> <br />No, she wasn&rsquo;t a lurker of airports or a flight attendant who didn&rsquo;t know the dress code. It was just that her situation at the moment was kind of complicated. Alright, she was unemployed. You try going straight out of college with a degree in Psychology and zero work experience and see how easy you have it finding a job. Toni found out that it wasn&rsquo;t that easy to find one that didn&rsquo;t involve putting yourself in physical danger every day, or one that actually paid enough for her to eat something other than ramen for the rest of her life. <br />So this was where she ended up: living in a one bedroom flat with her older cousin while she tried to settle down in a place that was unfamiliar to her and find some way to make a decent living. <br /><br />The employment agency found it fascinating that in college she had had an unusual minor: Korean. It just so happened that there had been a request for a translator for a big company that was coming into town for a concert. They told Toni that the CEO for the company would be flying in earlier than everyone else to make sure preparations were complete, and that she was to be there to greet him and welcome him to the states.  Thus she had given up her short shorts for the day (in hopes to look more appropriate) and was now suffering the consequences of the blistering LA heat. <br /><br />Not to mention that the guy she had been waiting for was late showing up and Toni had about as much patience as a toddler waiting to be fed. She stood there trying to keep herself from fuming when she heard a cautious &lsquo;Toni-shi?&rsquo; come from her right.<br />She whipped her head around to see the ceo of SM Ent, the man who she had been waiting for for a good fifteen minutes.   She immediately put on her pro attitude and beamed a smile his way. &lsquo;Ne, annyeonghaseyo,&rsquo; she bowed. They exchanged their greetings then left the airport.<br /><br /><br />&lsquo;Wow, for an American you&rsquo;re really good at Korean. How did that happen?&rsquo; he questioned Toni during the car ride to the hotel. They had spent the day sorting out rooms, last minute details for the concert, procedure for when all the musicians arrived, etc. He had arranged for her to have a room in their hotel in case any other emergencies arose and he needed someone who could communicate.<br />She blushed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not get into it if you don&rsquo;t mind sir.&rsquo; <br /><br />&lsquo;Oh? It&rsquo;s a secret? Alright, I won&rsquo;t pry any further~&rsquo; he teased.<br /><br />&lsquo;It&rsquo;s n-not that.&rsquo; She managed to spit out, her face now the color of the red nail polish she wore on her fingers. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just that everything that led up to me taking an interest in Korean would make me seem like a total nerd, and that&rsquo;s not usually a side of myself I like showing to people, especially those I&rsquo;ve just met. I&rsquo;ll just say I started watching Korean dramas, and I wanted to be able to understand them without having to depend on someone else to tell me what they&rsquo;re saying.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Ah&hellip;.so you don&rsquo;t listen to Korean music?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Not really. I mostly just watched dramas and movies. I never really paid any attention to the music.&rsquo; She realized who she was talking to. &lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s just that it took me a while before I could even understand Korean, and learning that took a while. Not to mention I was still in school and had a bunch of other things going on, so even being able to watch the shows was something amazing&hellip;&rsquo; she rambled on, nervous she had given him a bad impression of her. He broke her nerves with a small chuckle, and she breathed a sigh of relief.<br /><br />&lsquo;That can be a good thing.&rsquo; She looked confused. &lsquo;See, our company is one of the biggest in the Kpop scene, and we have some artists that are kind of popular. And well, since you don&rsquo;t know anything about the music, you probably don&rsquo;t know how the fans can be&hellip;it can be scary sometimes. They really fall in love with the groups.&rsquo; He sat there and let his words sink in. &lsquo;Confused?&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Not really, it&rsquo;s just different. It sounds like what happened in You&rsquo;re Beautiful. I thought it was all for the show, but is that really how it is?&rsquo; He nodded in confirmation. &lsquo;Wow,&rsquo; was all she could say.<br /><br />&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve worked hard today, and usually I don&rsquo;t let people outside of the company do this, but we&rsquo;re having a party tonight to welcome everyone in and to relax a little from the trip before the stress of the concert really sets in. You want to come?&rsquo;<br /><br />Toni smiled and graciously accepted his invitation. Hey, she might not know who they were, but if there was anything years of watching Korean dramas and movies had taught her, it was that Korean men can be extremely gorgeous. Wouldn&rsquo;t she be an idiot to pass up the chance a million other fans would kill to have? She thought so.<br /><br />After rushing back to her cousin&rsquo;s flat from the hotel, Toni had agonized for hours about what to wear. Her cousin finally put her out of her misery. She went into the back of her closet and pulled out one of the most stunning dresses Toni had ever seen in her life. It was a rich black color, with red undertones wrapping their way up and around the dress, a thin layer of black lace covering the red. Toni&rsquo;s breath caught, and she just knew that this was the dress that would make tonight something really special. <br /><br />The party was a lot more crowded than she was expecting, and just filled to the brim with the beautiful Korean men she had so been lacking in her life. She had guessed that would probably be the case, so she had gone all out in getting dressed for the occasion. She had the aforementioned stunning mini dress on, (that hugged her curves in all the right places and landed with a small flutter around the top of her thighs), she had rolled her hair, (attempting to get the wild curls under some control, and pulled it halfway up so that it cascaded down her back in small layers), and finally she had completed the ensemble with her favorite pair of black killer Guess stilettos. She looked hot. She knew that, and so did everyone else in the room. She spotted the CEO and swiftly made her way over to him.<br /><br />&lsquo;Ah, you made it!&rsquo; He exclaimed, smiling widely, and making room for her to sit at the table with him. &lsquo;Everyone, this is Toni-shi, she helped me out a lot today, so make sure you&rsquo;re all nice to her, okay?&rsquo; he threatened, inciting chuckles from the people at the table. Toni took her place next to him, and finally had time to catch her breath and take a look at the people she would be spending the evening with.<br /><br />There was a stunningly beautiful woman sitting to her right who introduced herself as Victoria, and Toni found out she was actually from China. Next to Victoria was another extremely good looking person. Onew had a round face with a smile that seemed to light up the room, and twinkles in his eyes that made a person feel like he knew something they didn&rsquo;t. Next to Onew was a man they introduced as the dinosaur, and it took everything Toni had in her not to choke on her margarita because she could actually see the resemblance.  The person that came next made Toni lose her breath for the second time that day.  <br /><br />She really thought she was looking at an angel, and she had to wonder herself how he wasn&rsquo;t the first person she had seen when she entered the room. There seemed to be a glow around him, and every part of his face looked like it had been sculpted by David himself. Almost instinctively her tongue slid quickly over her bottom lip and then she slowly bit it, no one at the table knowing that this was her sure sign that she had an interest in someone. <br /><br />As if licking her lips hadn&rsquo;t been obvious that she liked what she saw, the head tilt and raised eyebrow most certainly did. However, Toni wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had been looking a little too long and a little too hard. The CEO must have caught on to this, and being the trouble maker he is, he suggested &lsquo;Taemin, why don&rsquo;t you ask the lovely lady for a dance?&rsquo; He turned to Toni, &lsquo;Taemin here is known as one of the best dancers in Korea. Care to see if it&rsquo;s true?&rsquo; He asked, his eyes shining with mischief.<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh I really couldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a terrible dancer, and to be up with the best&hellip;.&rsquo; She trailed off- losing every coherent thought she had in her mind when she looked at Taemin again. She hadn&rsquo;t even realized that he had left his seat with a smile to come take her hand and lead her to the crowded dance floor. She could admit it now: she wasn&rsquo;t a terrible dancer. In no way was she good enough to be a pro, but she knew how to not embarrass herself. <br /><br />The song that filled the club was one that had a medium tempo, and just enough bass for her to feel the music through her whole body. She took her place in front of Taemin, and felt him slowly slide his hands down her arms, leaving a trail of chills down the path his fingers traced, before he finally settled his hands gently on her hips. She could feel him behind her, his body in tune with the music, in tune with her moves, knowing just the way she was going to twist next, and making sure he countered it. <br /><br />She could feel his breath growing faster on her neck as she leaned further into him. She could feel her head swimming from the tequila in the margaritas and from the heat that was coming from their bodies. She suddenly turned around to face him, his face looking even more beautiful when painted with the flashing lights from the ceiling. She closed in on his ear to tell him that he was a really wonderful dancer. She knew from the smile on his face how happy it had made him.<br /><br />&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t shown you anything yet.&rsquo;<br /><br />&lsquo;Oh really?&rsquo; She shot back, the challenge clearly thrown down. He accepted it, and stepped to the center of the floor to do one of the dances he was so popular for.<br /><br />Toni was surprised at how the people just seemed to part in front of him, like he was the Moses of the dance floor and the crowd was his Red Sea. <br /><br />The music started playing, and the crowd started cheering him on as if what he was doing was the most natural thing in the world. The way he moved his body&hellip;Toni couldn&rsquo;t helped but be amazed.<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i1018.photobucket.com/albums/af303/latoshan32/sexytaemin7.gif"" />"

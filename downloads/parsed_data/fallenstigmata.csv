day 23, it's getting too easy now. i don't crave juice any 
longer nor bread or pasta.. my brother said i will kill myself on this diet. sometimes i do wonder if i am addicted, i mean i dont cheat at all. This diet is important to me.. 

i've been told by friends that they liked me the way i was
and that i dont have to try so hard but they dont live inside me day after day, you know?

i feel good and until i no longer feel good why stop what's going right? i upped my carbs to 40grams a day, which is still nothing. I haven't used over 20 yet still, maybe i am obsessing...but it gives me something to focus on.. and i'm in control... sometimes that feels good.."

"event","This is day 21 for me. No cheating thus far. I need to add 
something, my body needs a few carbs and some more fiber to balance out my system. 

So, I was thinking I would have some kind of fiber filled 
cereal in the mornings for breakfast and I would add 
green beans and apples and possibly carrots.  I need to look up some more food on the net to see where I am standing. I start week 4 tomorrow and I haven't been back on the scale, I know I've lost 18 pounds so far and that was as of Thursday. 

I can tell a difference and so can others sooo that's an accomplishment.  I already know that If I stay cut off of sweets such as ice cream, candy and soda that I will loose more weight and achieve my goals. Also If I stay minimized on bread and pasta which I haven't added back to my diet as of yet I should stay down. 

Week 6 I am going to add a cup of pasta and if I go back to bread at all It would only be 2-3 times a week if that and it will be wheat bread. I've been reading of it's benefits. :)

well that's my update.. I'm still hanging tough and losing weight. I wish that everyone who is struggling with their weight could have my will power right now. That is something I'm very proud of.. my will power in the past has SUCKED! However now I'm very confident and strong :)

Now i need to clean my journal and change my color themes and such."

Febuary 7th the National Guard Division that David her husband is in is having a meeting for all spouses and members of the guard. They were already told that febuary they would have 3 weekend drills and that if they get shipped to iraq they will be there anywhere from 8-12 months.  David was also told that they have over 100,000 troops already there and that they plan on having at a minimum 350,000.  Anyway, Lisa's going nuts and I don't blame her.. Jonathan is only 7 months old and she has one on the way... if David leaves for a year Lisa fears that Jonathan won't know him when he returns, plus she is having to deal with the rest of this pregnancy. 

Hmm.. I don't know obviously right now it looks like it's going to happen.. he said that his superiors told him it's 98% positive they will be leaving soon.

foods that I can consume. 

I have lost 15 pounds so far! I am starting to feel good about myself. 
I have been painting watercolor now for a week and it seems to be going well - I had only done water color once and it was a trial thing 
but it seems easy - I'm just not all dainty and precise about it. As with all painting I'm so abstract most of the time. 

I've finished a book. I'm happy about that. I've been reading about 
marriage and weddings and families and children and dieting and vampires!! 

my mother told me that if i lost 10 more pounds (which I so plan on losing 85 more pounds) that she would buy me a few outfits!!  That's exciting! 

work still sucks but HR took care of the Majority of problems however 
my boss still avoids me - I guess he just doesn't know what to say now and I don't blame him what so ever. I'm sure it's tough on him even though he is a pain in my ass. 

The lady from HR called me today and told me that my boss and my team leader had nothing but good things to say about me. If they have nothing but good things to say then why are they always saying bad things to me?  Didn't make much sense, other then they aren't wanting to get in trouble over it.. Oh well.

Jennifer is up to her same old shit which is driving me fucking bonkers - earlier today I was talking to jeri about taking craig snow boarding this weekend up north for a little get away for just him and i - we need the time to ourselves. Anyway it wasnt even two hours after that I heard her telling carl (her work boyfriend) not to make any plans for the weekend because she was taking him snow boarding. I ABOUT FLIPPED! I can't count on one hand how many times she has done that, I'm sure she could of thought of it on her own but she didnt. Last month I talked to her about taking a weekend and going to Niagra falls, what did she do?? she went and brought back a ton of pictures of her and him making out on the boat near the falls... it just gets to me she went to canada last year because vicki was talking about going and she went to vegas 2 months ago because jeri and cheryl were talking about it.. she even stayed at the place they were talking about staying at.. its just odd its like she has to do everything first - so i guess i will just not tell her anything else.. i should have learned ive known her 2.5 years now and shes been nothing but a bitch...

For example, My father used to have a friend his name is Aaron, he wanted everything my father had and was always trying to out do him - nicer cars, shoes, tv's..etc.. I found this very amusing and pathetic. Why are some individuals like that? It's like they are trying to live your dreams and visions. Around those kind of people you have to watch what you say because your dreams will become thiers too and how disappointing is it to watch someone do all the things you talk about wanting to do.  

Anyway, I must go on and on about my ring. Just let me talk about it again hehehe. It's SOOO beautiful, and I'm not just saying that either. ya know I would have never imagined a ring like this on my finger (well almost on my finger) lol. DAMN LAY AWAY! but at least it is there and I'm getting something way better then what I imagined ever owning and he even told me i could upgrade which is fabulous!  The ring part itself is amazing and I wanted a princess cut diamond so I got that too!  I can't even describe how it looks but it's platnuim. I actually wanted white gold but we fell in love with this one, so i'm so excited. Funny thing he is going to propose all over again when we get it out of lay away.  It is a 6 month lay away program but he said he would have it out by my birthday in may but he thinks it will be way sooner.

Sooo, we purchased a new desk and I must say it's a very nice one :)  I have been saving money for various things lately and budgeting a lot better. I haven't eaten fast food in over 2 weeks meaning I have saved at the least 75.00 dollars, plus I have not been buying any form of soda for 2 months that has saved us 18.00 and no snack foods for 2 weeks which equals approx 28.00 dollars for a grand total 
of $121.00.  

Anyway, I'm proud and I've cut out a lot of other things too, but I'm not going to calculate that until next month - when I will get a more accurate figure. 

Also, we will be saving money too when we get our new place because only 2 of us will be eating the food. One adult is a HUGE savings, not that John doesnt pay for some of his food because he does but most of the time he eats what we buy too. 

Today is day 11 on my Diet! Still doing great, I haven't cheated. John I think did, I found a grapefruit juice top on the table in the living room - he didn't deny it. However his will power just isnt into this diet.

2 filet lemon peppered fish (kroger in the frozen fish section 
  they are around 3 dollars and taste fresh and very good for 
  frozen fish, they have all kinds and it's 1carb 0 sugar)

3 hard boiled eggs 

approx 10 slices of hot pepper cheese 0carb - 0 sugar. 

cost:  approx: $5.00  you can't eat out for that and it be healthy. 

I'm so proud. I usually have a can of tuna, eggs and tomato but 
I switched it up today. However for the rest of the week It I plan on having pretty much the same thing for lunch. Substitute tuna and fish. 

Oh, and vitamins are very important.  You can also have herbal tea, but if you want sweetner the best for you is splenda.  Also you have to make sure about the tea, it's all about watching labels.  there are 0 carb 0 sugar teas. :) Green Tea is really good but you can't have just any green tea, again watch for Carbs!!

<lj-cut text=""read more about my process if you want"">
Bowel movements are very slow now and painful. Constipation was inevitable from what I was reading anyway, but I recommend a stool softner for all those who are starting atkins. Seems like this diet is very popular on lj lately. I actually was convinced because Dr. Atkins was on Tv talking about it a few days before I started mine. He will also be on Larry King tonight at 9 if anyone is interested. 

You will have very loose bowels the first couple of days - each body will react differently as my room mate and I havent reacted the same with every aspect, such as he is used to mega loads of sugar intake, through fruit and junk foods. He had major withdraws in the first week - shaking hands, upset tummy and almost broke down because he was so in need of bread or any sugar at all for that matter.  I on the other hand have not experience Sugar with draw, I think it's because before that I had eliminated soda completely and maybe only had something sweet once a day or every two days. 

Just thought I would give some advice, however everyone is different. But if you start shaking don't worry about it, do something to take your mind off it. 

Just don't let yourself get bound up, some people dont have a bowel movement for a month or so if they don't take care of themselves.   <lj-cut>"

I knew it was coming, but I was hoping for ummm.. peace? 
<lj-cut text=""possible war"">

WASHINGTON (Jan 6) - The U.S. military has put at least 275 Army Reserve units -- involving more than 10,000 soldiers -- on alert to be ready to move overseas as early as this week in preparation for a possible war with Iraq, USA Today reported on Monday.

Citing U.S. Defense Department sources, the newspaper said unit commanders were ordered to be ready to move out between Jan. 10 and Feb. 15 and that Reserves in this latest call-up would likely be sent to the Persian Gulf region, joining thousands of other U.S. forces.

Lt. Gen. James Helmly, commander of Army Reserve Forces, told the paper the new orders affect more than 10,000 troops, including several thousand other Reserves alerted on Friday for duty in the United States.

Spokesmen for the Pentagon and the U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Gulf region, were not immediately available for comment on the report.

As of Dec. 31, nearly 54,000 Reserve and National Guard troops already were on active duty.

The Gulf-bound Reserve troops would join nearly 60,000 U.S. military personnel in the region, a number that could double in coming weeks.

On Friday, the Pentagon ordered some units of the 45,000-member U.S. 1st Marine Expeditionary Force to deploy from California to the Gulf region. Other Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, were also expected to go in coming weeks.

In addition, the Army was beginning the deployment of more than 11,000 soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division in Georgia as well as hundreds of engineers and intelligence specialists from Germany to the Gulf in a new surge of troops, warplanes and ships in case President George W. Bush orders an invasion of Iraq.<lj-cut>"

"event","<b>Dear everything that is right,

I've thought about you for many days and the thoughts of how we are growing apart. How I could write you a novel and you would act like it meant nothing ignoring me and pretending to have the most pleasant of lives & perhaps you are. 

The wind it flows around us and we laugh just in a memory not taking the time for each other any longer, just leaving what was as a lingering thought motionless and suspended above the cloud of thoughts we consume daily. 

I blame no one but myself for my actions but who do you blame for yours? Why do you continue to read what I write, it's no longer for you any more, but for myself and my memories. my legacy. 

Your still here I see. So I may as well spill it. I will not pleasure you with all the thoughts I have. There is one thing I can not forgive - But you will never hear me mutter those words. It is a secret even to you. However shallow 
your reasoning it wasn't right - sometimes in life people just can't forget even if they wish it more then anything. 

So I will go through my days in a normal life without you once again. I will focus on me and be as selfish as I can - because I get that from you as it has rubbed upon my skin. I will turn my head and act like I'm happy and I will put on a front and talk about all the wonderful people in my life. In books they say people go on and on about being happy when they are trying to cover up just the opposite..keep that in mind. 
You will miss me but by then it will be too late. 

If not perhaps you will die..Maybe of heart disease or diabetes..if you die with me weighing on your heart and you haven't done anything about it, you will not ever need answer to me for God will have his way with you (by form of appology). 

How can one's blood be pure with you in it? Don't say I'm being harsh, you have no room - just waltz off into your perfect sunset with your perfect family, because family is something I am not. 

I've had my 2 cents and done all that i could of, months of counceling, the emails the letters... Mock me if you may but your heart is unclean and has no room for belittlement and no room for me. 

Everything that is wrong.</b>"

"event","ok. I started atkins diet yesterday. Today however is my first full day and the day I will start counting. I know I need to start eating a healthy breakfast, but I've never been the breakfast type. So. I will try but I don't see how I will manage. 

<lj-cut text=""My diet Day 1"">
I planned out my lunch last night and I think the amount of food I had was satisfying and I will probably eat this type of lunch Monday - Friday during induction. Since I will be at work most of the time and It is somewhat easy to eat these foods here. 

Lunch: 3 boiled eggs
       1 sliced tomato 
       1 can of tuna  + 1 teaspoon of real mayo. 

Carb count: 5.2 -6 points. I'm not sure how many the mayo is. 

Pretty good I must say because during induction I can only have 20 grams of carbs per day. My brother was on this diet and lost a lot of weight, he didn't maintain it and gained it all back plus some - however if he would have maintained his eating habbits and not picked up the bottle again, he would have made it! 

My roommate is on the same diet and we started around the same time so eating will be easy to do in the evenings because we will have each other to lean on. Tonight we are going for a walk to start our exercise routine. I'm also going to do a few sit ups but I will let you know if I actually did them. Ug. Exercising didn't used to be this hard. 

My goal is 105 pounds. I know that sounds unrealistic but I would be at the weight that I should be to stay healthy and 
active. I would just be happy to lose my double chin. So I am going to try to focus on the chin and not the pounds. What can it hurt?

I also have diabetes, I contacted my doctor and he stated that it would be a good thing due to lowering carbs and intake. If I can lose the weight and stay at a healthy level he is sure that i will be able to go off of my diabetic medication which would 
increase my life in many ways. :)  I hate it that I have let myself go, but I see others who are bigger then me and I think that could be me if I don't do something about it. 

So here goes nothing. One day at a time - they say if you make it through induction that you can do it! 

I just hope I don't get sick of Meat, Egg's and Cheese! In week 3 I can add Nuts!! I'm thinking Pecans, I love Pecans :) mmmm.. 

I'm going to make my new years resolutions later on tonight .. closer to the new year.. I know what they are going to be already and No it has nothing to do with weight loss, I will not make that resolution again - i always bum myself out over it. I have 2 new ones that I think I can stick to. 

YEAH! 

Please send me some inspiration and good luck charms are needed & appreciated.

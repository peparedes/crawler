"event","I bought the latest from STEREOLAB - Instant 0 in the Universe today. Good thing I did. This is a fine example of why I love the Lab. Ahh, I can't wait till there full length album comes out next year! Everyone must go buy it now! Go, go on...yes now!!! I can't explain how incredible and genius this ep is. Reminds me of Dots and Loops but a bit more disco in some sort. Good beats good beats! It's a bittersweet album...the influence that Mary had, and her voice is missing, but nontheless STEREOLAB continues on putting out material like no other. Besides Bjork, Leaticia Sadier is an incredible influence. I will stop now! 
<img src=""http://www.twee.net/pix/slab.jpg"" alt=""title or description"" /> 

I also bought Ladytron's SOFT CORE JUKEBOX...another album everyone should have. 

And I bought Affinity by Sarah Waters. I love me those lesbain themed novels :) Speaking of lesbian...The Lesbian Gay Film Festival will begin this Thursday and I really really want to go see Tipping the Velvet on Thursday night. There's a chance I might be going solo, but fuck it oh well, I have to see it or else...maybe Lani will say "" fuck the fact that I'm pooped and that I haven't had a day off from work since Thursday, I'm just going to go with Hanna and watch Tipping the Velvet""...haha!

Fuckin hell I have tons of homework to do, and I think I will ignore the fact and watch a movie instead. No, I'm just going to lay on my bed and listen to Stereolab all night.

You fear she might see the emptyness.
She tries not to look into your eyes

She implodes

Who needs words ?

Diving into the Wreck

First having read the book of myths,
and loaded the camera,
and checked the edge of the knife-blade,
I put on
the body-armor of black rubber
the absurd flippers
the grave and awkward mask.
I am having to do this
not like Cousteau with his
assiduous team
aboard the sun-flooded schooner
but here alone.

There is a ladder.
The ladder is always there
hanging innocently
close to the side of the schooner.
We know what it is for,
we who have used it.
Otherwise
it's a piece of maritime floss
some sundry equipment.

I go down.
Rung after rung and still
the oxygen immerses me.
the blue light 
the clear atoms
of our human air.
I go down.
My flippers cripple me,
I crawl like an insect down the ladder
and there is no one
to tell me when the ocean
will begin.

First the air is blue and then
it is bluer and then green and then
black and I am blacking out and yet
my mask is powerful
it pumps my blood with power
the sea is another story
the sea is not a question of power
I have to learn alone
to turn my body without force
in the deep element.

And now: it is easy to forget
what I came for 
among so many who have always
lived here
swaying their crennelated fans
between the reefs
and besides
you breathe differently down here.

I came to explore the wreck.
The words are purposes.
The words are maps.
I came to see the damage that was done
and the treasures that prevail.
I stroke the beam of my lamp
slowly along the flank
of something more permanent
than fish or weed

the thing I came for:
the wreck and not the story of the wreck
the thing itself and not the myth
the drowned face always staring
toward the sun
the evidence of damage
worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty
the ribs of the disaster
curving their assertion
among the tentative haunters.

This is the place.
And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair
streams black, the merman in his armored body
We circle silently
about the wreck
we dive into the hold.
I am she: I am he

whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes
whose breasts still bear the stress
whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies
obscurely inside barrels
half-wedged and left to rot
we are the half-destroyed instruments
that once held to a course
the water-eaten log
the fouled compass

We are, I am, you are
by cowardice or courage
the one who find our way
back to this scene
carrying a knife, a camera
a book of myths
in which
our names do not appear."

Title: Penelope
Album: Blue Screen Life, Penelope Single

Oh Penelope,
Are you filled with air?
Swallowed oxygen,
Makes you float up?

Is it dropsy?
Will your lungs swell?
It's depressing me to see you struggle.

Oh Penelope,
Are you filled with air?
Swallowed oxygen,
Makes you float up?

Is it dropsy?
Will your lungs swell?
It's depressing me to see you struggle.

I'm treading water with my oars,
Glass galleons anchored, ocean's floor.
I'm diving down with all my gear,
In search of treasure, para me corazon.

Take you to the forest,
Let you feel the raindrops falling down,
Seeping through your red scales.
Eliminate the faucet,
Eliminate the need for water,
Replace it with a safe shell.

Ohh, ohh

Don't want to see you floating
Upside down
On the top of the bowl
When I come around to visit you
No, girl
Need you there
Need you there
Need you there

Ohh, Release that air

(Ohh)
I'm treading water with my oars
(release that air)
Glass galleons anchored, ocean's floor
(oooh)
I'm diving down with all my gear
(release that air)
In search of treasure, para me corazon...

Take you to the forest.
Let you feel the raindrops falling down
Seeping through your red scales
Eliminate the faucet
Eliminate the need for water
Replace it with a safe shell

If they summon the rains now,
Are you gonna rise?

If they summon the rains now,
Are you gonna rise?

Title: Boo
Album: Blue Screen Life

[notes on this song]

As I set down these notes on paper, 
I'm obsessed by the thought that I might be the last living man on earth.

2X2L calling CQ... 
2X2L calling CQ... 
2X2L calling CQ... New York

Isn't there anyone on the air? 
Isn't there anyone on the air? 
Isn't there anyone?

Inside this leaking submarine
The hull is closing in
The water is above my ankles
Now that I still can't get you off of my
I don't think that we can pull this one off
We shall see, time will tell
What is time and why does it
Taste like salt water inside of my mouth?

Someday I will sail again,
To a distant shore, far away.
I will sail again,
To a distant shore, far away...

If the line snaps,
There's no air,
Will you hold me?

If I'm asleep, 
Will you wake me?
If this rises,
We hit the waves,
Will you dive back down?

Someday, I will sail again,
To a distant shore, far away.
I will sail again,
To a distant shore far away.

High hope
Something's tugging on my leg
And there it goes
Shallow water
Must be on the horizon
But still too
Far to go
Spilling blood so fast
I can't keep up much more
Sorry, sorry,
Can't go no more.
Sorry, sorry, 
Can't go no more.
Sorry, sorry,"

Tis the evening of the day
See the daylight turned away
Then I'm looking up at you
See that everything that's true
I'm a thousand miles away
On another sunny day

As I'm looking at the view
All I'm thinking of is you
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means

Is this the parting of the ways
Summer light and daisy chains
As I'm looking up at you
See that everything that's true
On the mountains, on the plains
Railway lines and fierce....

As I'm looking at the view
All I'm thinking of is you
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means

Tis the evening of the day
See the daylight turned away
As I'm looking at the view
Feel my heart is growing oh-so
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means


He's so stoned
Doesn't really know what he's on about
Maybe he should go and lay down
He's steamed/stoned/pissed
Doesn't really know what he's on about
Maybe he should go and lay down

(Run away!)

"event","Tonight was very exciting! I left to Natasha's house around 10p.m...and we left to Aiko's house! Alle was there when we got there, which made me very happy to see him again! We all each did a line of coke! I feel awful for doing so, but at that moment I said fuck it! Now I am very awake, and I am hating every minute of it! Anyway. we took off, and went to the OHM! It was packed, and the music was fabulous! We danced till 3 in the morning! It was a different experience! I saw alot of girl on girl action, some weirdo guy started to break dance, and some other idiot decided to keep elbowing me through out the night! If it wasn't for Aiko, hitting him back, I don't think he would've stopped! He was on something badly! Besides that, I had great fun with the kids! Natasha was kinda weird throughout the night though! She still can't get over the night before! Apparantly she made out with one of her freinds...which happens to be  a girl...umhmmm in front of all these christians!!! And she was very ""LIVELY""! I guess she is just embarrased about how she behaved! I didn't think it was such a big deal or that she acted wrong! But natasha will be natasha! That girl cracks me up! She says she will never drink again...I highly doubt it! Good times though!
And I will probably not sleep until who knows when..or eat! I am never doing coke again! It's just not my style anymore! It was fine while it lasted! Fuck, to think I have to go to work in about 6 hours or so...sacrilage!"

"event","Wow...has it really been months since my last post?  It seems like forever that I've made the time to update about how life has been.  Not a whole bunch has changed (I guess I need to read my most recent post to know that for sure)...*reading* Hmmm, actually a bunch has changed.  As of the last post, I've gotten a job promotion and bought a house.  LOL...I know I know!  Things moved kinda fast!  It's all good though.

The Promotion:
At work, I've been promoted to Six Sigma Black Belt.  Ok, for those of you who don't know about Six Sigma, please check out isixsigma.com.  Anyway, it's pretty much process improvement idealogy.  I will say, there are MANY great things about being a Black Belt: pretty much you are your own boss.  They give you a time period in which to complete a project; you get it done.  No one tells you how, but of course there are many that are willing to help.  The pay is also very nice, if you can get your BB certification.  I've seen some jobs that will start you out with $80k!  AMAZING!  You get to go out on company cash.  We've been to so pretty nice places...all expense paid, too.  Very nice.  Plus, you get the clout of being a BB.  I'm doing really good because I'm the first in the company to get the position as fast as I did (less than a year with the company) and as young as I am.  All Glory be to God!  However, there are some not so great things:  you're pretty much your own boss.  This means that there is no one telling you how to get results.  You figure all of that out on your own.  Also, not everyone will like the results of your project.  Not all companies are good with change; mine is the ring-leader of change resistance.  Not all of our employees are on board with Six Sigma.  Most of them think it's an easy job.  It also doesn't use a lick of what I went to school 5.5 years for.  That sucks a bit; however, I'm pretty sure this is what I'm going to be doing for right now.  I'm also spending 2 years out of design for this job, which will mean that other designers will surpass me in skill and when I'm done in 2 years, I will be back at the skill level I was at when I left.  LORD HELP!  I'm still trying to make sure that I keep up on my design skill in my spare time.  

All in all, I love this job.  It's great and perfect for me.  I also got a $4500/year raise in less than 1 year of being with the company.  I'm not sure how many people accomplish that, but I'm glad to say that I have!

The house:

Ok, about the house...if most of you are on Facebook, I've posted some pictures of what it looks like.  It's a 3 bedroom house with 2.5 bathrooms; 2-story; big backyard.  I love it.  It has 9 ft ceilings and ALL appliances included with the house.  We have cherry-stained cabinets (42"") with nice countertops and flooring to match.  It's SO much space...almost too much just for the 3 of us.  And get this...we're only paying $125k for it...it's appraised at $130k...so we're starting off with a little bit of equity, and we haven't even moved in yet!  We're only bringing less than $100 to the table in closing costs.  We can't complain at all!  We'll be closing April 27th at 12pm, and we are SO ready!  Be on the lookout for announcements about a house-warming.



Enough about that...let me tell you about my husband.  He got accepted to Duke University this summer for their program to transition undergrads straight to the PhD program--FULL RIDE!  The only bad part about that is that he will be gone all summer long.  I think he's only coming home on the weekends.  I'm glad it's only in Durham, which is about an hour East of Greensboro.

Also, Sigma Gamma Rho's Gamma Chapter (NC A & T) had NINE girls to present themselves as new inductees last night!  I was SO proud.  That's the biggest SGRho line I've ever seen.  Also, it was the first time I'd ever been on A & T's plot.  It's pretty nice.  I'll post pictures on Facebook soon.

Ok, I'm tired.  The blessings of the Lord truly maketh rich!  I'm so glad that we are in receipt of so many wonderful gifts from God.  It's been a long time coming, but things have finally turned around for us.  I can't wait to see what's in store next.  Until next time..."

"event","CHANGE IS GOOD!  I'm sitting in my cube at work, wrapping up a job that is due today, so I'm feeling pretty good.  Plus today is PAY DAY!! $$Cha Ching$$  It'll be nice to finally  have some dough in my pockets.  This week has been a good week thus far, as I am climbing over the hump called ""Wednesday.""  I love Wednesdays, just because you know it's half way over.  And next week, it'll be my FRIDAY since, I'm off Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday.  We're going to my uncle's in Goldsboro, NC, so it's not too far.  It'll be good to see my family again...well, at least some of them.  I have a bone to pick with some others, but we'll see what happens when the time comes.  All I have to say is that WHEN YOU MESS WITH MY MOTHER, YOU MESS WITH ME!  You know what I mean?  Don't no body mess wit momma.

On a less angry note, I'm loving life!  If you look back at some of my earlier journals (like last year), I was STRUGGLING!  Now, things are 100% better than they were last year, and God really gets all the glory for it.  I'm just glad to say that we perservered and made it through.

I gave blood yesterday, so if you've given blood before you know that the most painful part is the prick they do on your finger to check your iron level.  Typing right now is a tad painful, but I'm cool.  I actually enjoy giving blood.  It's almost symbolic to me.  Jesus gave His blood so that I might live.  I want to give my blood so that someone else can live.  YOU KNOW THAT WAS HOT!  That's patented, so don't try to steal that one.  I mean, I know I'm not Jesus, but if I'm a Christian ""little Christ"" walking in his footsteps, I can at least give my blood.  I know he gave His life..that's why I didn't die for you.  LOL...I can give you a pint of my blood though.  I'm O+, so I can give to all positive bloods.  But I can only get O+, I think...not really sure about that one.  If you know, hit me up.  I might need to know that.  The most you'll be is a tad fatigued.  PLUS THEY GIVE YOU ALL THE SNACKS YOU CAN EAT!  Mmmm..free snacks...So, if you have blood and are able to give it, please do.  You never know who's live you will save because you gave some of yourself for another.

Last night, my family and I took some time out to just hang out.  We cut on the fireplace, pulled out Nyelah's mega blocks and had a good time.  I actually pulled out the camera and took a few shots of us.  You can see them on facebook later on tonight (I haven't posted them yet).  It was really nice just relaxing, no stress, no bill collectors calling, burning our gas fireplace simply because we can...that's a good feeling, y'all.  We played TOGETHER for about an hour, and then Nyelah got tired of her blocks.  We put her in the tub, while Jeffrey and I just sat on the floor in the living room all snuggled in front of the fireplace, TV off, listening to Fred Hammond's new album booming through our surround sound system, just enjoying the moment.  ""We are truly blessed,"" I said.  ""Yeah, we really are,"" responds Jeffrey.  GOD IS GOOD!  I'm almost about to cry writing this because IF YOU KNEW WHAT I KNEW!  People warned me not to marry this man; they said it was ""premature"" or ""wrong"", etc.  Even the ones who were closest to me had things to say.  It's been 3 years and we're still going strong.  Some might laugh because it doesn't seem like a long time, but we've been through more in 3 years than most people have been through in 10.  It's just amazing that if we listen to God, He guides us, even when others are in opposition of the situation.  People don't see the whole picture because they are on the outside looking in.  Only you and God can see...and He knows the outcome.  That's an awesome thing to be able to say.  Well, after Nyelah's bath, I braided her hair while Jeffrey did some school work.  By the time I finished, we were all ready for bed...It wasn't anything extravagant...just peace.  Peace in my marriage, even on my job...peace.  There are those who like to think they know, but you know and God knows.  There's nothing like His peace pulsating throughout your WHOLE life.

Well, I got that out of my system...lol.  I had a chance to hang out with some sorors a few nights ago.  There is one soror on WSSU campus and she had a forum for our Founder's Week about the importance of the black vote.  It was really a great turnout and an actual discussion.  Afterwards we hung out on the plot (pics on facebook) a bit and laughed; talked about our hopes for more members, and stood in awe because there were like 8 ladies on the plot that night, and 5 different chapters in representation.  That's amazing...SGRHO is small, we all know that, but there are really some quality women in the organization.  I wouldn't be a part of it if it wasn't.  So, we're going to be having some things underway to get more interest.  After the plot, we all went to McDonald's and talked some more.  We ran into this graduate Kappa who was really cool an wearing some blue and gold glitter Air Force 1's.  So, of course we had to give him some props for that!  He said his wife made them for him (she's an AKA), which I thought was really nice.  Maybe I should make some for Jeffrey...lol.  Yeah right.  Jeffrey and glitter shoes, I doubt it.  But they were cute anyway.  I might make some for myself.

So...I ordered my first jacket.  Now, it's a pretty cool jacket, but it doesn't have a line name or number on it.  SGRHO doesn't believe in that...nationally.  So I have to have a jacket that's ""regular.""  But you know me, it's not gonna be ugly just because it doesn't have my line name on it...lol.  I also have a bracelet in the making and it IS CUTE.  My own design.  I think that I will have to take up bracelet making because I know some sorors will want to get on this one.  I'll let you see it first after it's made, then let me know what you think.  I'm telling you...it's nice to walk into a Greek store and see your letters, and not be frustrated because your organization doesn't exist to most people, so no one has any stuff for yours.  It's something I've never experienced before, but I'm glad to say I can experience now.

I think that's enough for now.  It's just that I had a few things I had to get out.  You know, it's  been a few days since I wrote.  Have a wonderful day, lovely people."

"event","I am SO sleepy...I would LOOOOVE to take a nap right now!  However...I am currently washing clothes and giving Nyelah a bath.  I guess that comes with the turf, right?  WELL I LOVE EVERY BIT OF IT!  Sometimes, it gets a little overwhelming having to deal with all the responsibilities of having a family, but at the end of the day...when the clothes are washed and folded; when the dishes are done and the kitchen is clean; when your little girl has had a bath, been read a story, and is sleeping soundly in her bed; when your husband comes home to a clean house and is free to kick up his feet and watch some TV for a bit with his wife at his side...it's ALL WORTH IT!  I just have to encourage myself to remember my priorities...GOD, FAMILY, work and church.

Anyway, I'm sure most of you have seen or heard that I'm a NEW MEMBER OF SIGMA GAMMA RHO!!  I'm SO excited that I have a new organization to be proud of and call my own.  I really won't go into the details on how this came to be.  That's really not important.  Just know it is, and I'm happy.  I know folks are wondering, some are mad. It's all good because I'm all the more encouraged that I made the right decision FOR ME.  Just be happy for me...or not.  Whichever is up to you.  I ain't mad.

I'm REALLY looking forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  For some reason, family has been EXTREMELY important me these past few years...probably has something to do with my dad's death.  Thanksgiving will be at my uncle's house in Goldsboro, NC and Christmas will be at OUR PLACE THIS YEAR!  I'm really excited about that last one!  I will have the apartment all festive and I'm COOKING!  Watch out now!  Yall ain't ready fo' me!

Y'all, God is good and He is faithful.  He's been SO faithful to my family and I.  For those of you that have been keeping up with my journal, my husband wasn't coming with me to church.  Well, he's been coming with me for the past 3 months and guess what?!  HE JOINED A COUPLE OF SUNDAYS AGO!  God is SO good!  So now, we both get to serve side by side in the ministry we've chosen...TOGETHER.  That's an awesome feeling!  God truly answers prayers.  I'm excited about where God is taking our family!  Also, Jeffrey is planning to attend get his PhD in financial economics soon!  He currently has a 4.0 and they are encouraging him to further his education!  I'm so proud of my baby!  Also, Nyelah is now 3 YEARS OLD!!  She's almost potty trained...a few mishaps at school and home.  She rarely wets the bed at night!  She's such a big girl!

I'm just feeling really good and I KNOW that God is with me.  It is evident in my life that He's not left my side, nor my family.  We are continuing to stay strong in Him and keep Him as the center of our lives.  Keep us in your prayers!"

"event","As of now I'm taking my lunch break at my desk...at work...::sigh:: I mean, who feels like spending money on food you have to pay someone else to make for you when I can make it myself...maybe...""What on the menu today?"" you ask?  Well, today: Healthy Choice Slow Roasted Turkey, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables; Yoplait Light blackberry yogurt, and about 3 slices of cucumbers with fat free ceasar dressing.  Yummy!  I intended on eating more cucumbers, but I'm full.  How many people can say that they've had all their vegatable servings before 1:00pm?  Believe me, it's not the norm.  I normally struggle to get in veggies and fruits.  I don't have that problem with starches though.  Anyway, I've rambled enough.  

I really wanted to talk about the WONDERFUL wedding I went to this past weekend.  Tiffany and Chris got married this weekend and it was really nice.  It was good to see people that I hadn't seen in years.  Why in the world does everybody look so skinny now?  I think I missed that memo.  I thought that when you got married, you got fat!  I mean, that's what happened to me!  Cruel world...Anyway, yeah, everyone's all skinny now.  I mean, I've lost 10 pounds, but obviously that wasn't enough.  Needless to say, everyone looked good...and happy, so that's a plus.  I had the honor of singing with Christina, Jermaine, and BP on the praise team for Tip's wedding (Lamar was on the keys).  Yeah, Tip went gansta and had a praise team at her wedding.  I think we did ok.  I've definitely done better before, but it definitely wasn't too much.  People weren't falling out in the floor and confessing what they must do to be saved, but I believe God was still glorified.  I also did makeup and was a hostess for the event, so I wore many hats that day.  Let's just say that by the end of the night, I stole some roses to use for later on (wink, wink)...they still in the bag somewhere.  I was KNOCKED OUT.  Besides there only so much you can do with your husband sharing a room with your daughter.  LOL...such is life... Anyway the bride was BEAUTIFUL!  She was graceful...and boy was she ready!  Not an ounce of nervousness in her, which is a good thing.  Oh, did I mention that Nyelah was one of the flowergirls?  My big girl did such a good job, and she looked good doing it.  Come on now, you know I'm not gonna have my child looking any kind of way.  Her dress was cute, even though it wasn't the one Tip picked out for the wedding.  David's Bridal supposedly didn't keep any white and apple dresses in ANY store in America.  It would've taken a supposed 12 weeks to get here.  Needless to say, it was $99!  $99!  What in the world?!  So, we got her dress online for $68, and it worked out well.  

After the wedding, we went to my mom's to visit and got a chance to meet my 2 new cousins from Africa (my Aunt Lillian and Uncle Lin adopted them).  I think they are about 5 and 6.  Really great kids!  We they left, we all talked about old times and my mom's constant drama in my family...LONG STORY.  We left my mom's and went to my mother-in-law's in NOVA for Labor Day.  That was nice, except for the fact that I was in a real ill mood and I still don't know why.  I think Jeffrey made me upset in the car or something like that.  It's amazing how when you're married, things set you off so fast, and then you forget them when someone asks you about it later.  Who knows?  Obviously I don't.

Anyway, I really don't have much to say...what I've said was a gracious plenty.  I'm tired, too, by the way.  I'd really like to take a nap; however, since I have choir rehearsal tonight, that probably won't happen.  Until next time, blessed people."

"event","It's early Saturday morning, and it's a good day to be alive.  It's sunny outside and my sister-in-law is on the phone with Jeffrey talking about how their cat just had kittens!  Yay!  Hopefully, Jeffrey will let me have one...I doubt it though.  (She's right - Jeffrey)  Today is gonna be a good day.  I know that God will be with me in all I do today, and that gives me peace.

Well, folks...tomorrow I have a solo at church, and I'm a little nervous about it.  I've never sang a solo at my church before, but I know that God is going to have His way.  In case you're wondering, the song is ""He is Here"" by Martha Munizzi, which is SUCH a beautiful song.  I just pray that God will take control and move in the sancturary tomorrow morning.

I really don't have much to say today.  Everything is just really peaceful.  I do have a situation with a certain person that I need to end.  You ever have a person that only called you when they were in trouble or needed something.  Yeah, I have one of those people in my life.  I thought she was going to be a really good friend, but as it turns out, she just needs from me.  I'm still praying about the situation because I don't want to hurt her feelings and I know life can be hard for a young woman in this world, but some things you bring on yourself.  Being outside the will of God for your life leaves you open to attack by the enemy.  Well, I just hope she starts getting things together for herself.

I hope that everyone has a great day.  Later."

"event","Hello all...It's been a little while since I've updated.  I'm at work, but things are a little slow right now.  I'm waiting to hear an update on a code change from IBC 2003 to UBC on this job in Puerto Rico...yeah, Puerto Rico.  Who would've thought that I'd be designing something out of the US?  Who would've thought I'd be designing steel buildings that I can drive to and see?  It's a really crazy thought, but it's the truth.  

I feel blessed to have the job that I do; to work with the people I work with.  Each person has his/her own contribution to the phenomenon called ""amusement"" at my place of work.  From throwing rubber bands, to ice; stealing shoes (yeah, I know) and food...the list goes on and on.  There have actually been a few times where I've considered whether or not this place is actually for me.  It's in the country (there's a railroad track that runs RIGHT in front of my building and yes, at least 3 trains come through a day.  The normal dress is jeans and a t-shirt with sneakers...and chewing tobacco.  LOL...yeah, there are guys that actually walk around here with a cup that this spit in.  It's really gross and I've made it clear that there is to be NO spitting in my trashcan.  See, there goes another rubber band across my screen.  Give me a minute to retaliate...excuse me.  Skewed that one a little to the right.  I'm getting better though.

Anyway, enough about work.  A few weeks ago, Jeffrey and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary!  YAY!  It's amazing how much God can do in a year's time!  I'm thankful that we've lasted this long.  I'm sure there have been many to say that we'd never make it this long, but I'm glad we've made them out to be liars. God is faithful.  Well, we spent our get-away weekend in VA Beach (Nyelah-less) at a friend's apartment (she let us have it for a few days -thanks Felicia O.).  We watched many movies, went to the aquarium, saw Superman Returns on IMAX (great movie, by the way), and walked the beach at night.  Y'all, it was so peaceful.  I really can't explain it.  It's not like we'd never been to VA Beach before, just not together.  Needless to say, I was at the beach, but didn't get much of a tan...if you know what I mean (wink wink).  That was a great weekend.

Life now has pretty much been great.  It's been full of choir rehearsals, Bible studies, fun in and by the pool, walking 2 miles a day, trying to lose weight, having Jeffrey's siblings for a month, having my cousin Josh stay for a week, love making, watching Nyelah grow from a 2 year old to a 3 year old, eating good food, and spending time with our couple -Tahmal and Candace.  This has been a summer for the books, ladies and gentlemen.  However, I'm glad it's coming to a close.  I'm ready for some cooler weather to walk in.  It's time to pull out the boot cut jeans, turtle neck sweaters, leather coats, and boots, ladies. Hopefully my locs will have grown another 1/2"".  That would be nice.  Oh yeah, being about 30 pounds lighter would be nice, too.  I'm working on it. All I'm going to say is that by this time next year, I will be at least 100 pounds lighter.  I'm doing all I know to do (the right way), and it is working thus far.  I've already lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks.  We'll see what happens.  Maybe I can post pics of my progression.  No promises.

So yeah, hopefully, Jeffrey will be out of school next Spring, and I'll be sitting for the EIT exam.  Then we'll move to Charlotte, NC, which is where we really want to be.  We shall see as the Lord leads.

I love my church, y'all.  That joint is blessing me SO much.  I've learned more in the 6 months I've been there than I have my entire life.  Right now we're learning about the Kingdom of God (on this earth) and how we were given dominion to rule in it when Adam and Eve were created.  However, when they submitted to sin in the garden, Satan relinquished that power from us.  Jesus Christ came to give it back to us and show us how we are supposed to walk as rulers in the Kingdom.  I can't remember what scripture it is but it's where Jesus says, ""Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand.""  Anyway, I could go on and on.  Some of the stuff I've learned would blow your mind...it's blew mine.

Anyway, it's time for me to leave work (I actually took a break for about an hour to talk with a co-worker about wine tasting and fly fishing).  I pray that you have a great weekend.  I know I will!  Until next time, God bless."

"event","I'm glad that I've finally taken the time to write another entry in my journal.  I'm not even sure how long it's been, but better now than never, right?

Much has happened since I last wrote.  My Mary Kay business is taking off in ways I didn't know were possible.  My husband has been going to church with me EVERY Sunday for about a month and a half.  We have my husband's siblings staying with us for a month (please send up a prayer for me for patience).  I believe they will be going home July 22nd!!  I'm very excited about that because I want my apartment back...My brother graduated from high school, is going to Norfolk State, and just got a spot in the band...and you KNOW how hot Norfolk State's band is.  I've also been singing on the praise team for about 2 months now and am loving it!  It's an awesome thing to utilize your gifts on the norm.  Not many people get the opportunity to sing as much as I do and can sing.  Sad story, really.  Let me see...what else?  Well, as I talk more, I remember some things.

So, I'm sitting here at my desk and I have a coworker of mine who I just found out is adopting a little girl!  I was really excited about it!  More than he knows, actually.  I really like this guy...he's kind of uptight, but goofs off every now and then.  He used to be really quiet around me, but he's opened up exponentially since I became an employee.  I believe that he and his wife lost their newborn (I don't know the details), I know this little girl is going to bring much needed joy to their lives.  God, I pray that she's healthy and remains healthy.  I pray that her presence brings your love, joy and peace into their lives.  Lead and guide them in the knowhows of parenting, because I know having your first child can be frustrating at times. Comfort them when they need comfort.  If there is any bitterness or anger because of the loss of the first child, I ask that you begin to soothe that hurt like I know that only you can. In Jesus' name I pray.  Amen!  I'm so excited for them and I wish them nothing but the best!!  I know he'll be a great daddy. :-)
Oh yeah...also, God is opening up doors for me on my job to participate in Six Sigma.  Six Sigma pretty much teaches companies how to maximize profit by really knowing what the customer wants and then perfecting the processes it takes to make the consumer product.  It's an AWESOME opportunity, and I'm so glad that God sees this as a path that I should take.  I started out just talking to coworkers about it to see what they knew about it.  Most of them could care less, which is NOT good.  They thinks it's some sort of elite group that's only open to a certain clique of people.  Then, I actually talked to a key player in 6Sig-a blackbelt.  This is like the highest level you can go in 6Sig, which is where I'd like to be someday.  So pretty much, one thing lead to another, and I'm now going to be participating in a Kaizan event (where you analyze a certain department and its processes) next week!!!  Now, this was solely God because there are 13 designers, including myself, and my boss picked me to be the engineering rep at this event because my job schedule was the clearest (I've been staying on top of my work)!  HALLELUJAH!  God, I pray that you just go before me and prepare things for my arrival.  Let me know who to talk to, and who not to talk to.  Open doors, and close the ones you don't want me to walk through.  In Jesus' name I pray. Amen!
I'm excited about what God is doing in me and my family.  My husband...he's great!  He and I have been connecting on a level that I wasn't sure we'd ever get to. Let me just tell you...last Sunday when the praise team was ministering, the spirit of God got real heavy in there and everyone was just worshipping Him.  So, I open my eyes for a moment just to continue to connect with the audience, and I see my husband - eyes closed and hands upraised.  I nearly lost it!  I've NEVER seen him do any of this--EVER.  God is doing His thing in my husband, y'all.  My husband is beginning to realize his role in our family and walk in it.  That's an AWESOME thing!  The prayers of the righteous truly do avail much!  In addition to this, we will be celebrating our 3 YEAR ANNIVERSARY July 26!!!  God is faithful! We're both so excited because we look back on where we started and we know that it was God that brought us this far.  We still haven't figured out what we are doing as of yet, but we will soon!  Just keep us in your prayers.  What I tell yall about that FOG?!  If you don't know, you better ask somebody!!  Haha. Much love"

"event","Sometimes...I wish I could just sit back and watch my life happen and not really participate.  I get so tired sometimes...literally fatigued, that I have to sit down and take a breath or two before I fall out.  My life has been so stop and go that I've hardly had a chance to just relax without having something to do.  But you know what?  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I can remember a time when I didn't have friends (just last year) that I could call to go out with, or when I was just sitting at home with nothing to do but complain.  It seems like it was only yesterday.  But here I am, with friends and a really good job, an up and coming business...I guess I just need a break every now and then...

Well, this past weekend, my health knocked me down on my butt.  I had strep throat (still do), diarrhea, coughing, nasal dripping and congestion, and a constant head pressure that wouldn't let up.  Horrible!  It started Friday night and is still ongoing.  Although the diarrhea has stopped, along with the head pressure, and nasal stuff...my throat is still throbbing.  The worst part about it was that this was the first Sunday that I was supposed to sing on front line, but since I got sick, I couldn't do it.  Talk about upset!  I've been waiting for this moment ever since I knew what a front line was.  Nevertheless, I know my time is coming, so I'm not worried.  I just had my backup sing for me until I get better.

Anyway, I'm a little tired, so I will go to bed now.  I just pray that everyone continues to stay encouraged in God.  He is still there.  He always has been.  Just yield to Him.  Love y'all.

Also...there is a certain organization that is soliciting me to be a part of them.  I'm still praying about it, because this org has what I need as far as where I am as an alumni.  We'll see what happens.  They've invited me to a picnic in June, which I'm going to go to.  I really think it's time for a change...

I am SO tired right now, but I'm watching a little bit of TV before I hit the sack.  Jeffrey has gone out for a night run in the gym.  I'll get to that point one day.  Right now, I'm tired.  Have a great night, LJ land."

"event","So, it's 4:04pm and I don't have anything else to do today at work...I really wish that I could leave for home because I'm hungry.  I've been snacking on fruit and carrots all day.  A sista needs to eat.

Well, first of all a BIG congratulations to all the LJ grads!  I'm SO glad you made it!!!  Lamar and Amy, I can't wait til y'all tie the knot.  I'm not exactly sure if I can make the wedding yet, but I really hope so.  That's a blessed union, y'all!  You yet holdin' on?...Well keep on keepin' on, babies (in grandma voice).

As for me...Mary Kay is going ok.  I wish I could sell more products, but it seems that women aren't interested.  I bet it's me.  I mean, I really am not able to dedicate all the time and effort like I want to into it because I actually have a 9-5, but I really want to see this thing grow.  Mary Kay is more than just makeup, it's making women realize they are beautiful.  It's more than just skin care, but instilling self esteem.  I know that God will cause this endeavour to bloom beyond my wildest imaginations, it's just gotta sprout first.

Well, Jeffrey and I were gonna write up a contract for a condo we were interested in owning; however, we both decided that downgrading from what we have now is not really part of our vision.  We want what we have now, and then some.  So we are planning to get a house towards the end of this year into next year.  We had gotten preapproved for the loan and everything.  It's just that things were moving TOO fast and they were talking about us being in a house in 45 days!!  ""WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,"" I said.  We just signed a 1.5 year contract with the apartment we have now and we haven't even been in there 3 months.  That would mean trying to find someone to sublease, which I don't think would've been that hard since the apartment is SO cheap and SO spacious.  Like I said, we thought we were ready, but we really weren't.  We still have much more to do financially and research-wise.  We're in no rush...:-)

Tonight is the night that we find out who's on frontline for the choir at rehearsal.  I can say that I'm kind of nervous because you just never know these days.  I can definitely say that I'll be happy with whatever outcome occurs.  I'm happy right where I am in the background until God gives me the opportunity to move up in the ranks, ya know?  JUST PRAY THAT I'M ON THE FRONTLINE!!  THANK YA!

So, there's this lady in my church choir (Pam) who can REALLY sing, and you know I don't just throw that phrase around being a fellow singer myself.  She saw potential in me during frontline auditions and asked me to do some backgrounds on some songs she wrote!  HONORED, WAS I?  Oh yeah I was!  I went to her place and had a session and she pretty much is working with me to open up my horizons as far as my voice.  She's showing me how to open up and let God use me.  It's almost like I'm getting to know my voice for the first time.  There are things that I can do that I did not know I was capable of.  Sometimes all it takes if for someone to see something in  you and show it to you.  I didn't even know it was there.  I'm so thankful for her!

So yeah, last weekend we went up to NOVA for Jeffrey's grandmother's 75 birthday party, and while we were there we decided to kill two birds with one stone and see my mom for Mother's day and my sister for her birthday.  Why did Nyelah and I get a stomach virus the last two days of the trip!? I don't know what in the world happened.  All I know is that Nyelah kept puking in the back of the car.  I just knew I was in an Exorcist moving the way that stuff was coming out.  Then I would tell Jeffrey to pull over on the side of the road.  Madness I tell ya.  We ended up staying in a hotel Sunday night so we wouldn't contaminate Jeffrey's mom's house,  you know, where we could puke freely...hahaha...I guess I shouldn't make fun of that, but since I'm making fun of myself, it's ok.  We left Monday morning and I missed work because we wanted to make sure it was over.

Sometimes I sit back and laugh at my life because it is SO funny, the things that happen to me.  I know God laughs to sometimes...not at me, but with me.  I know He has a sense of humor, so it's cool.  He probably says, ""Look at this girl..."" shaking His head.  I'm just glad that He knows that I'm gonna make mistakes, and provides ways of escape for me before I even need them.

There are people that I know that struggle within themselves everyday.  They are alone and full of the feeling of not knowing what is going on in their lives.  That's a sad way to live.  Sometimes I want to grab them and say...""Try Christ.""  I'm telling you what I know.  Life without Him is a drab.  You have no joy, no peace.  I can't live like that.  Do you know that I had $50 in my account this past weekend, but I was SO full of joy that it didn't matter.  I know who my Dad is, and I will NEVER go lack because I am His child.  What good father doesn't provide for his kids.  But I ended up getting paid a whole day earlier than normal.  FAVOR OF GOD...FOG...Dave Martin said, ""I see FOG in my future.""  What do you see in  yours?"

"event","Well, I'm back for another update.  Things have been going really well with me lately.  I've decided to make an aggressive change to become an awesome woman of God.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think that I was all that bad to begin with (since the beginning of the change about 1.5 months ago), but I know that there are some renovations that need to occur in me.

Last week, an inspirational speaker by the name of Dave Maritn came to speak at my church about living the Ultimate Life.  He was late so he really didn't get a chance to speak that long.  However, I DID buy his 20 CD series called ""Creating the Ultimate Life.""  IT IS AWESOME!  I know I've listened to CDs 1-7 twice already and I've been blessed thus far.  He's been talking about revamping the way we think and the way we see ourselves.  Our attitude...all of that.  It's been nice constantly hearing positive words being pumped into me on a daily basis. 

I've also been listening to ""Teach Me How to Love"" by Juanita Bynum.  My mentor (Sherricka) gave me the CD at one of our weekly discipleship meetings and I haven't turned back yet.  I can't lie, Juanita's been stepping on my toes EVERYDAY!  But I know it's all good for me.  The CD has caused me to change the way I see my husband and the way I treat him all together.  Just awesomeness, ya heard!  

At my church, Pastor Stokes has been implementing the Power of 12, which is basically where he took 12 men and poured all his knowledge into them.  His wife did the same with 12 women.  Now, these 24 men and women have chosen 12 more people to pour into.  I am GLAD to announce that I have been chosen to in Sherricka's Circle of 12!!!  I am excited about what God is getting ready to do in my life.  It's crazy because Sherricka and I have been talking for a while since I joined DCC, and having weekly meetings.  It's what I've always wanted.  She's married with children, so she's someone who I can relate to.  I PRAISE GOD FOR HER!!!  I get to wear a Power of 12 button, and when the time is right, I will chose 12 women to be in my circle of 12.  This is awesome, y'all!

I am excited about going to VT this weekend.  It's been a LOOOOONG time since I've been able to get down there.  EGC is having their choir concert, and my sorority and frat brothers are having a step show on Sunday!!  I think they are even having a picnic on Saturday.  Aaaaand...Jeffrey AND Nyelah are coming with me.  So, it will be nice to have my family with me.

I am praising God for His many blessings in my life and those around me.  I pray that every blessing on my life will flow into the lives of every person I meet and every person reading this entry.  I love you, Lord.

"event","It's just about the end of another work day and a sista is TIRED!  I had a few times today where I dozed off a little; nothing major.  I do think that I really haven't been getting enough sleep lately.  Well, when you have as many exciting things going on in your life as I, you would probably lose out on some much needed rest also.

Yesterday was a GREAT day!!!  Work was cool.  But I had two other really exciting things to go down yesterday.  1) My husband's mom and siblings are in town!  It's been a breath of fresh air to have them around the house.  Normally, it's just the 3 of us, so it can get kinda quiet.  Now we have 8 people in our apartment right now...fun stuff!!  2) Rachel's birthday was yesterday and I took her out to dinner.  This lady is great, you guys.  I can see her developing so much as a young adult trying to make it in life.  She's overcome huge obstacles in her life and she's much stronger than she gives herself credit for.  We ate dinner and talked...and talked...and talked til the restaurant closed.  Oh yeah, if you're ever in GSO, try Austin's Restaurant on High Point Rd....GREAT FOOD!  Anyway it was good times.  

Rachel, my mother-in-law, and I are going to this financial success workshop at my church tonight which should be very informative.  I can lie and say that I don't need a lil help in that area--::clearing throat::.

Well, it's almost time to leave work (4:52pm) so I will talk to you all later.  Have a blessed evening!"

"event","As of now I am sitting at work with nothing to do.  I finished the one job I had early, so now I am trying to find something to do.  I've read enough code to last a lifetime, so I figured I'd update my journal.  I wanted to go more in depth about my new relationship with God.  I didn't really think I'd know Him like this.  I was thinking to myself that this MAY be like every other time I've done a rededication, but this time was different.  I know you must be thinking, ""DANG, Shantelle!  How many times have you rededicated your life to Christ?""  HAHAHA...well, good question.  Honestly, this is the second time I've actually ran to the alter to do it.  Other times, I did it in my quiet time.  So yeah, like I said in the previous journal, God had be plucking my heartstrings for a while.  I had been out of church for almost a year (not ""plugged"" into a church home).  I did a little church hopping, but I never settled down somewhere.  Part of the reason why I never did was because we never stayed in one place long enough for me to be able to diligently look for a place.  It's only part though...About a good 95% of it was me running from God.  I got to the place where I no longer had a desire to go to church (crazy, right?) or really be around people of God.  I also didn't want to pray.  But my spirit was crying out to God.  I swear I'd be in the car listening to ""All Around"" by Israel and New Breed and bust out crying.  My spirit longed SO much to reconnect with God that even the mention of His name brought me to tears.  I knew that I should've been feeling different, but I wasn't.  I was a living, breathing battle ground where there was a struggle b/w my flesh and my spirit...and it seemed my spirit was losing...badly.  

It didn't help that my husband had no desire to go to church, so I didn't go either.  Ladies, this is why it is IMPERATIVE that your man is a JESUS FREAK!  Because when you get weak, he is there to encourage you.  I was SO weak spiritually, and the spiritual head of my household was not acting as the leader.  So I was dying.  Just like a plant without water for days, weeks, and months...I was withering away spiritually.  My spirit cried out to God for quenching, but I had to be the avenue for my spirit to be fed. 

All the while this struggle is going on, I went from not having a job to having a good job to having a great job.  To having a crappy apartment to an apartment SO nice I HAD to decorate it.  God was still with me.  Right now, my pastor is teaching on seeds and how to sow them (tithes) and cultivate them (faith).  I honestly believe that the times when I was faithful to God and sowing in His kingdom paid off during this time.  There was probably a WHOLE lot of God's unmerited favor in there somewhere, too.  Each transition was so smooth that I KNEW it was God that provided.  All around me, friends, family, etc were unemployed and couldn't find jobs, yet God provided me with water in a desert.  I PRAISE HIM BECAUSE OF HIS MERCY AND GRACE TOWARD ME!

I knew that I needed change in my life...so I finally broke down and prayed for God to open up doors for me to meet people and find a church home.  One Saturday morning, I went to the complex gym (a sista needs to workout) to work on those famous problems areas.  I saw this woman in there and spoke to her and the next thing you knew we were chatting about life, but more importantly--God.  She told me about her daughter and thought we'd make great friends, so she called her down on my cellphone (Niya).  Niya came down and we talked and talked and talked.  Needless to say, we're GREAT friends now.  She has blessed my life so much and I am grateful to her for the wisdom she's poured into me.  Her mom invited me to go to church with them (Destiny Christian Center) and I accepted (of course).  

I'm telling you, God answers prayers.  He knew my heart and HE set up this divine appointment so that on that Sunday I would come running to the throne like a little child to her father.  I'm telling you...the communion is SO strong now.  It's nice to lay down at night and smile at the stars through the blinds and know that God is smiling back at me.  I love Him SO much.  I was laying in the bed one night and just cried because my heart was SO full of love for Him.  And I just felt Him surrounding me with His eternal love.  

I feel like a baby in Him, but it's all good.  I know that my growth is exponential in God if I continue in his Word.  I know that He has SO many blessings for me (Deut 28:1-14) and I remind Him of them everyday.  I am currently taking ""Perfecting 101"" classes at church that teach on the basics of being Christian.  I praise God for the reinforcement.  I look forward to going higher in Him!!!

I encourage those of you who know Him not to be stagnant in your walk.  Continue to seek Him.  Test His Word and see won't He back it up!!!  If you don't know Him, give Him a try.  What do you really have to lose?  I mean, the Bible is pretty much a big book of what should be common sense anyway (some if it).  If God doesn't show Himself to be all He's cracked up to be, then I'm a liar, and so is He.  I promise you, you won't be sorry.   Much love, all."

"event","I didn't realize that I hadn't been on here in a while until I read all 1 million of Valencia's entries...I thought to myself, ""Dang, it HAS been a while, hasn't it?""  So, I've decided to finally get on here and do some updating.  As of now, I am sitting in my fluffy white robe on my sofa in my living room and there is something in the air that hasn't been there for a while - quiet.  hahaha...Nyelah is off for the weekend with a friend of mine (April Neblett, Valencia you might remember her) who heard my desperate cry of longing to have some alone time with my husband.  That's right folks!  If you haven't guessed it, you will NEED to spend some quality one-on-one time with your spouse, which can be difficult and pretty much non-existant when you have a child and spouse who is in school.  So I try to take what I can get when I can and just be glad that I'm alive.

There's been a lot to happen since the last time I wrote, so I'll just number them to keep track as I think of them:

1) I found a church home!!!  THIS IS EXCITING NEWS, LADIES AND GENTS!  I've been looking for a very long time for somewhere to go where I can get fed, without luck.  Sometimes, I'd like to think that I really wasn't looking, but running...I still can't figure out why I was running from God.  Doesn't really make sense to me.  It's not like I was doing terrible things - I just wasn't living a life pleasing to God, and I knew it.  Needless to say, I rededicated my life to Christ my first day there.  God had been dealing with me for a while, but I didn't take heed to Him calling me.  So yeah, Nyelah and I are members of Destiny Christian Center in Greensboro, NC.  Notice that one person is missing...I am praying that God will change his heart.  I know He is working on him.  I believe that he will be rejoicing with me in services real soon.  But as of now, it's weird waking up by myself to get Nyelah ready and get to church.  Just pray for us.

2) I also joined the choir there, too.  AWESOME CHOIR!  It's kinda crazy because seeing them on stage and seeing them in rehearsal...it's like two different choirs.  It's really unorganized, which is something I'm not used to.  But maybe that's a reason God has me there, to bring order. We'll see what happens. It just feels nice to finially be doing something I LOVE to do --sing!  I know that God will have His way, as He customarily does...hahaha!

3) I'm becoming more engaged at work.  I was a tad worried about that.  Being on the interview for VP I thought that the job looked boring.  But it's really not.  I design an ENTIRE metal building from every bolt to every steel frame.  It's crazy!  I never thought I'd know this much about steel and how it all comes together, and there is still so much more to learn.  However, I DO know that this is not somewhere that I will be for the rest of my life, like everyone else there.  God has predestined me for much more.  I can't lie and say that I don't miss the work that I DID have at MM&A.  I like consulting.  But that atmosphere and the company in general...I'd much rather be where I am.  I walked away feeling really hurt by them, but I came out victorious in the end!  I praise God for that.

4) I am loving having a close friend that lives across the tennis courts from me.  Niya is great!  We spent all of last Sunday together and I had a great time.  I look forward to many moments we will have in the future.  Rachel...I miss you, too.  I haven't had the chance to talk to you since you, Niya, and I went to the movies together.  I drive past and see your black Honda out there and wonder how you're doing.  I've been bad with staying in touch and I apologize.  

5) I finished decorating my living and dining room.  It looks really great.  I guess there's not much more that I can say about that.

6) Today is the anniversary of my dad's death.  I'm gonna call my mom today to make sure she's ok.  I know she is.  Last time I talked to her she said something about going to put flowers on his grave today.  Sometimes, I can't believe he's dead...well, I know his spirit is alive and well.  I talk to him a lot, but I cry less and less.  I love you, Daddy.

Dang, I guess I didn't know that I really didn't have that much to say after all.  Life is peaceful, and I praise God for that with ALL of my heart.  For the first time in my married life, I'm truly at peace.  Although my husband and I aren't on the same page spiritually, married life is still peaceful.  For instance, he just bought some roses home for me the other day...just for nothing.  Surprised the heck outta me.  I was SO happy because stuff like that NEVER happens.  The last time I got rose from Jeffrey was our very first Valentine's Day before we got married...so that was a while ago.  Anyway, I know he's working on it, so I don't complain.  God is good, that's all I have to say.  He's awesome and I see His glory manifested in my life EVERYDAY.  Well, that's about all for now.  I love you all.  Thanks for ""listening"" to me.  My husband and I are about to go and take a stroll around our new neighborhood.  Wow...God is good!"

"event","Well, it's been about a week or so since I last wrote, so I thought I'd come and give another update on how life in Greensboro is going thus far.  Life is good...that about sums it up.  Working at Varco Pruden has been  WONDERFUL.  Though most of my time there has been spent being trained, at least they think I'm worth the training.  Shoot, they even pay for lunch every now and then.  Didn't get that at MM&A.  Don't think I ever would've.  Oh well...that's history.  As of now, I'm sitting in my dining room eating a turkey sandwich and applesauce (yeah I still eat it) with a cup of pure Brita water.  I just came from the gym.  It was a good workout.  I also met a friend there, which I am really excited about.  She's a nice girl.  I think we could definitely be life long friends.  Her name is Nya!!  We (she, Rachel and I) are going to the movies tonight to see Madea's Family Reunion.  That should be nice.  It's nice to know that there are some females out there that aren't trying to hate on the other.  Why can't we all just get along?

We're pretty much settled into our new apartment.  Jeffrey's doing our room, and I have yet to start on Nyelah's room.  The living room is completely decked out and we have new dining room furniture.  The apartment is starting to look like it's actually be lived in, minus all the boxes.  We have decided to keep the duck decorations in the bathroom and just try to make it look a little more adult.  hahaha...if you can do that with rubber ducks.  I mean, why spend more money on a whole new bathroom suit?  Besides, Jeffrey and I still need something for our bathroom.  Have any ideas?  Let me know.

Well, I need to straigten up the living room and guest bathroom for when Christina comes to stay next Monday and Tuesday.  Oh yeah, she, April and I are having dinner Monday night.  That should be nice.  Ok, I'm gone for now. I'll be back..."

"event","So, pretty much I have to catch you up to speed on the past few days.

Monday-Thursday (20th-23rd):  I started my first week at Varco Pruden!!!!  I pretty much did training on our product base and components, as well as learning the program we use to design metal buildings.  I met some pretty cool people while training, which was nice.  The first day, I showed up an hour late because I thought I had to be there by 8:45 am.  They didn't tell me that training was starting and that it began at 8am.  So, that was kind of embarrassing, but everything worked out just fine.  They also took everyone out to lunch everyday that week.  GOOD DEAL, right?  I know I know.  I also tried to get as much packing as I could done...I really didn't feel like doing it.

Friday (24th):  MOVING DAY!  We moved from our old apartment to our new one.  It was nice having other people to move your things.  I've never experienced that before.  I actually felt kind of helpless.  I just kind of sat back and said, ""Put that there and that over there.""  It's definitely something I'd want to do again if I have to move.  We had to go back to the old apartment to clean up and turn in our keys.  We also had to pick up a few more things that were left in our apartment because there were some loose things that needed to be packed.  Then, we picked up Nyelah from daycare (for the last time) and headed back to Greensboro.

Saturday:  Most of this day was spent unpacking.  Rachel came over for a spell to check out the new diggs.  It's kinda crazy living in the building right next to her.  Oh yeah, if you didn't know, Rachel and I both live in Steeplechase.  I live in 1324 and she lives in 1322.  Small world!  It's nice knowing I have someone so wonderful as a neighbor!  Also, my bestest friend in the whole wide world came to visit, too --CHRISTINA MILLER!!!  She came ALL the way from Charlotte to see about us.  We went to Ruby Tuesdays and then went to check out some dining room groups at Rooms to Go (too expensive, by the way).  I was sad to see her go, but she did buy some Mary Kay from me!!!  Way to go me!  Thanks, Binka!

Sunday:  No...I didn't go to church and I feel bad about it.  Since I had such a late night on Sat, I didn't have the chance to wash Nyelah's hair and rebraid it (it was SO dirty), so I didn't want her to go to church looking like no one cared about her.  I know, that may seem dumb to you, but I've seen enough dirty kids running around here to know what it's like to say, ""Why in the world did his momma let him come out of the house looking like that?""  So, yeah...I'm definitely going next Sunday though.  I did slap a bandanna on Nyelah's head and we went to buy some stuff for our living room.  You gotta see the finished product!  It's gonna look great!  

Now, I'm sitting in the bed about to go to sleep.  I had a long day.  I just read some building codes and went over some lessons at work today, nothing really exciting.  I came home, started dinner, and left to get to Garden Ridge to get this HUGE painting that I liked for our living room.  I called Rachel up and we went over there together, which I thought was nice.  She was gonna get a movie from the 'Buster, but she decided to accompany to Garden Ridge.  Isn't she great?!  It was nice to have someone to help me manuever that HUNKAMALUNK picture in my car for transport to the apt.  She bought this little gnome that was holding a mushroom...it was kind of scary looking, but it was for a friend of hers anyway...hahaha...I know you're laughing right now, Rachel.  Anyway, I'm SO tired.  I will talk to you later.  Nighty night..."

"event","Well, not much has gone on since I last wrote.  Still the same stuff happening...moving!  We have finally signed the lease and gotten the keys to our new apartment.  Oh yeah, we live in a gated community, so you're gonna need to put in our code at the gate to get in after 6:15pm.  Kind of annoying, but at least we feel safe at night.

Most of today has been spent trying to get our things sorted and packed away.  Needless to say, I don't feel prepared to start working Monday.  I wanted to have the entire apartment packed today, but that didn't happen since I had to take a nap midway.  Anyway, Nyelah is taking a bath, Jeffrey is taking a short nap, and I'm sitting here trying to figure out what I'm going to wear to church tomorrow.  That's right, folks!  We're going back to church regularly.  I'm excited about it because I'm tired of not going.  Not sure if we are going to stick with this one, but at least we can stay here a while until we see otherwise.  It's a nice church, plus we have a few friends of ours that go there.  Hopefully, we can get there early enough to put Nyelah in childrens' church.  I am NOT trying to deal with that girl during service!

Well anyway, I have to whip up something for dinner (I know - its after 8) and finish giving Nyelah a bath.  I told ya, nothing exciting going on today.  We'll see what happens this week.

"event","As you know, the past week has been a rough one for me emotionally.  It seems as if I've been on this never-ending rollercoaster of feelings that never stops.  Yet, during this time, I learned SO much about myself.

1) I read too much into things.  I don't know if that's just Telly or if it's me being a woman.  I over read into reactions from people, what people say, and pretty much everything in between.  I have to realize that when it comes to men (especially mine) it pays not to read things the wrong way or not as they were intended to be read.  Otherwise...I end up in a big mess everytime.

2) I need to be patient.  I'm one of those people that likes to sit down RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT and talk out everything.  Everyone is not like me.  Sometimes it takes people time to think things over and get thoughts together.  Sometimes it takes time for someone to come up with a feasible solution that may not have been reached had it be discussed at that moment.  Besides, if it's an argument or something, things can be said that aren't meant...what a big mess!

3) Trust God.  I guess that's the most important lesson I've learned.  Here I am, 24 years old and knowing God since I was 10...and this concept is just starting to manifest in my life.  Don't let this happen to you!!!  I was reading a devotional today about a woman who lost her eyesight due to a recluse spider bite.  However, this situation ended up bringing her husband back to God.  She had been praying for this for 15 years...and it finally came to past.  Even though things seem dismal at the moment, God can see much further than we can into the future.  He knows what's best for us, even when it looks like we are in a situation that is NOT good.  I can't imagine going through anything like that and I'd never want to, but I see that her husband's salvation is more important that mere eyesight.  I just thank God for this wakeup call at this point in my life where we will need Him even more!

So...that's my little explanation of how God has been dealing with me lately.

Now, about the many blessings being received in the midst of it!!!  We found a new apartment!  3 bed 2 bath - $679/mo!  Yeah you saw right!  God really did it this time!  I had been looking for places to live since last month and I wasn't having much luck.  Either everything was really expensive or really run down.  We knew what area of town we wanted to live in, but the prices seemed so high over there.  The idea of moving back to Greensboro was to cut down on commute time.  Anyway, yesterday, I'm sitting in my car flipping through the Apartment Guide book and I see SteepleChase Apartments.  I hadn't considered them b/c it was too expensive.  But at this point, I was just like, let me call them anyway.  So I call, and I tell the lady what I'm looking for and my price range and when I expect to move.  That's when she told me about this 3 bed 2 bath apartment.  She was like, ""You just gotta see it!""  I'm thinking, ""Ok lady, you'll say anything.""  I didn't really have anything else to do, so I drove over there.  Homegirl was already in the go cart ready to show me the place.  So I get there, and I AM BLOWN AWAY BY WHAT I SEE!  It is lovely, y'all.  The bedrooms are huge!  There are vaulted ceilings in the living room.  The dining room is actually in it's own room and not connected with the living room.  It's everything I wanted and more.  Plus, Jeffrey can have a room where he can get away to do work or just relax.  I told him he could do his room however he wanted and I could do the rest of the house how I wanted.  Seems fair to me.  You can see the apartment floor plan here: http://www.liveatsteeplechase.com/floorplan520.23.htm .  I really don't do it justice because you gotta see it in person.  But yeah, it also has a gas fireplace with a mantle.  I never thought I'd ever be living somewhere like this for so cheap.  So I ask the lady, ""Why is it so cheap?""  Pretty much, in this complex there is a phase one and a phase two.  This apartment is in phase one.  No one wants phase one because it's not newer and as up to date as phase two.  So they've had a hard time renting it out.  So, they marked it down really low so that someone would get it --me!!!  hahaha  So, I mean, how is it that they marked it down right when I was looking for a place, just like this one?!  Plus, that day it was not application fee (normally $85) and there was a 50% reduction for the administrative fee (normally $150).  So I only had to pay $75!!!  Now, I still have to pay a security deposit, but that's normal.  I'm just really praising God because he loves us enough to give us EXACTLY WHAT WE DESIRED!  I stand in awe of Him!  But yeah...that's enough about that!  Rachel, since I'm in the neighborhood now, you're more than welcome to come over anytime!!!

I'm just excited right now!  I'm very thankful for what God has done for us!  Also, we just filed our taxes last night ($$) so that's out of the way!  I pray that the blessings that have been poured on me will flow on everyone reading this entry and people we meet!  In Jesus' name.  Amen! 

One."

I am trying to realize that this day, I AM loved, by God.  As cliche-ish as that sounds, it's my comfort as of now.  I think that I'm gonna find someone to do something with tonight for Valentine's Day.  I called my friend Andrea last night and I may meet up with her in Williamsburg to do something tonight.  My mom said she would keep Nyelah.  I just need this time to kind of get away.  I'm going home tomorrow.  I have to go look at another apartment I found online the other day.  3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms for $645/mo.  Isn't that a steal?  I'd be crazy not to get this deal!  But yeah, I'm excited about that. 

I start my new job Monday!  I'm really excited about it!  They are paying the lease break fee for my current apartment and up to $1000 for moving expenses!  Isn't that crazy?!  I know I know...I can't contain my excitement.

Anyway, pray for me, y'all.  I really need it right now.  Pray for my family (husband and child).  Enjoy your Valentine's Day.  I will do my best to enjoy mine.  God bless!"

"event","Well, it's just about time for me to go to bed, and my daughter is beside me wiggling because she can't go to sleep because I still have the light on.  I think she's trying to tell me something.  Anyway, I'm a little tired, but I decided to go ahead and write something.  To let you all know, yeah, I've been writing in my journal, but most of the stuff is TOO personal to even be public, so I've just kept it all private.  There's SO much going on with me right now; more than I care to really let out in the open.  Just pray for me is all I can say.  Life is getting to be down right unbearable and all I can do is cry.  You would think that in the midst of an important job change and God making ways for me out of no way that I'd be happy.  Well, I'm not exactly sure how I feel.  Life is changing for me in ways that I never expected.  It actually just dropped out of the blue and onto my lap as if a bird just pooped on me.  Life does poop on you sometimes, and seems to be no way to avoid something like this.  I keep asking myself, ""What did I do to deserve this?  Or what didn't I do?""  I still don't know til this very moment.

I'm in pain right now that is impossible to describe.  It's so strong that it almost has a numbing effect.  I really wish that the world would stop turning and acknowledge that I'm hurting right now.  But it doesn't...it never will.  It just keeps on turning.  Tonight, I was in Walmart picking up some deodorant and diapers, and I saw that it was so crowded from everyone rushing to get last minute Valentine's Day gifts.  I think to myself, ""Is it that time again already?""  As a married woman, I don't really consider this day to be one to look forward to.  Crazy, right?  Well, it's not normal, I know, but it's my reality.  Men of all shapes and sizes were standing in the card aisle trying to find the one that said just what they were feeling but could never seem to say any of the other 364 days of the year.  I really almost stood there and cried.  In fact, in the checkout line I had to snap out of a depressing trance I was in.  I felt the tears welling up in my eyes...""Be strong, Shantelle.""  That's all I could think to keep myself from sitting in the middle of the floor Indian-style and crying like a big baby.  

Lord, just help me to be strong.  I need YOUR stregth.  I know that Your strength is made perfect in my weakness, and right now, I am SO weak.  I need help.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I figure, ""For what?  What does life have to offer me today but more poop?""  Please help me to remember that there's more to life than poop.  Of course, I know poop will come, but there won't always be poop.  Good times will come.  Just be faithful, Shantelle.  Trust God.  He always comes through.  I know I have so many examples in my life where God showed up, and I knew it wasn't anyone else but Him.  It would be nice to have an umbrella during this pooping season in my life.  Even if I don't have an umbrella, help me to be able to withstand the pooping until it's done.  Then, bless me with a BB gun to give payback to the birds who decided to poop on me.  Amen.

Ok, well, on a lighter note, I got a chance to spend some time with a good childhood friend of mine named Yvette.  She's married with 2 kids and is doing really well.  I'm so proud of her.  It was good to finally have someone that I had so much in common with.  We both had to reprimand our girls.  We both took them to the potty.  She even spilled water on me trying to stop her daughter from playing with the salt shaker.  Good times.  Good times.

Well, I think that the Sand Man has finally stopped by for a visit, so I will keep him company.  Until next time, this is Shantelle Williams saying, ""Goodnight and God bless.""  One."

"event","Hey Tyler,

I decided to write a whole entry to you because a lot of what I wanted to say to you, I couldn't really say in the office.  And since that's the only place I got a chance to talk to you, I'm taking the moment to say some things that were on my heart.

1.  I really like you.  You're one of the coolest people I've had the chance to work with (besides Rachel..haha) and I really appreciate how you kind of took me under your wing and showed me the ropes.  No one bothered to show me the ins and outs of what I needed to know about MM&A to be successful, but you did what you could within your power.  I can say that I probably got the most attention from you.  Ryan never really gave me any work, and Klaus, well that's a recent development.  I guess they never knew how to let go and let Telly.  hahaha (that's my nickname if you didn't know) Let's not even talk about Tom.  You were the one that tried to make me feel the most comfortable in this ackward situation.  Thanks.

2.  You were always good for a laugh.  I had moments where I really wanted to sit in a corner and cry, but you would always come through with some joke or something.  Thanks.

3.  I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOU.  I had NO idea what an equalization basin was or what the function of it was.  Now I know, and it's all because of you.  You showed me how to do submittals, how check valves and butterfly valves worked.  You showed me how the Masterspec worked.  No one else even cared to teach me anything.  You took the time and I thank you.  Thanks.

4.  I know that you are in a tough position always being the one to bear everyone's secrets and things that they don't want other people to know.  I know that you probably know some things that you really didn't want to know.  You don't have to be everyone's dump station...you're better than that.  I know I dumped some things on you that I shouldn't have, and I'm sorry for that.

5.  I feel horrible about falsely accusing you concerning the ""travesty.""  I should've known it was her...it was SO obvious.  Anyway, that's water under the bridge.

6.  I have one piece of advice for you.  GROW SOME BALLS!  hahaha...I know you have it in you somewhere to stand up for yourself.  Frankly, you are invaluable.  They are treating you like crap.  Don't think for one second that if Ryan and Klaus got better opportunities, they wouldn't pursue them.  Who wouldn't?  It's the way things work.  They aren't bad people for that,  but they know great opportunities when they see them.  You have GOT to learn to look out for you.  If you don't...they will eat you for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  You are TOO good for this.  Now, I'm not saying leave.  You have to do what's best for you; you taught me that.  But you know your worth.  If I can get a better job with NO EIT, then so can you with 3 years of experience under your belt.  I know you know the deal.  Just grab the balls and go with it.  hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  You gotta love that one.

You are SUCH a great guy, Tyler.  I really don't ever want to lose touch with you because you've made an impact on my life like you wouldn't believe.  So hang in there and do what you have to do.  You're worth it.  EIT or not.  It's up to you to encourage yourself that you are the best of the best.

Love,
Shantelle"

This is craziness, complete and utter craziness.  I mean, it's so BLATENT.  I don't know why they just don't come out and say...""Ummm, we don't need you anymore so can you pack your bags, please?""  I'd almost be ok with that.  However, part of me knows that they just want me to waltz outta here.  So, for some reason this is causing me to stay put.  However...I've been here since 7:50am and it's now ::checking watch:: 9:10am and I have done NOTHING, except look up something in the IBC code.  I mean, come on.  I am so tired of this.  I think deserve better treatment than this.  Granted, I did just tell them I'm leaving because they didn't cater to my needs.  But still...I guess I'm just a different person.  Go with me...

""Imagination Mode""
Imagine you are an EXTREMELY small engineering firm with small branches and you happen to work for the branch that is doing the WORST.  So, you get a new young engineer that is ready to do work for you at the CHEAPEST price in the world (interviewees prior to him/her turned down the job b/c the money was trash).  What do you do?
A. Work the crap outta him.  After all, he's cheap and willing to work hard for pretty much nothing.

B. Let her sit in a corner, call on him when you need him (or don't), and let her be unbillable so it looks bad on your branch.

So what's it gonna be?

::Jeopardy music::  Time's up.

Anyone in his right mind would choose A.  You'd be an idiot not to.  It's good for him because he's getting the experience he needs as a young engineer.  It's also good for the company because you can get a lot of work done for a low price.  But I guess everyone isn't as smart as me...hahahaaaaa.  Anyway, I'm going to play a game or something, look for an apartment.  Who cares?  After all, I'm the invisible woman, right?  I do what I want.  One."

"event","Well, I've been holding off this journal entry for a while, and since I'm doing nothing at work, which is what I'm used to, what better time than the PRESENT to write this entry?  Well, here it goes...

A lot of things have happened since I last wrote a ""sane"" entry.  I know I know...my last two entries were a little out of the ""ordinary.""  That is because I was really going through some things, kind of still am, but they are getting better.  Well, for starters, I moved to NC from Blacksburg - starting in Greensboro.  Greensboro was horrible.  We were living in a crappy apartment and I couldn't find a job to save my life.  For those of you who have been keeping up, you know this already.  For those who haven't been with me as long (hi, Tyler!) this may be new info.  So, after finding a job with MM&A, I moved to Mebane, NC.  This is pretty much where the saga begins...and ends ;-)

I know that the majority of the entries I've written about MM&A have been pretty positive, which is true--for the mostpart.  I've been happy at this company for about a good 45% of the time I've been here.  The things I've been unhappy about (Tyler, you have an advantage over most of my readers), I haven't told you about, and I'll keep it that way to refrain from ""bad-mouthing"" MM&A.  Needless to say, I've had about all I can take from what I'm getting from this company.  As most of  you have probably figured out, most of the problem was pure bordem.  I also felt VERY left out, pretty much 100% of the time (no excuse for a civil office of 6 people).  So, no work and ostracized leaves me bored and upset.  I've complained about it probably 2 times (in 3 months) and nothing's been done.  Not even the Director of Engineering would honor my requests.  So, I did what anyone else in my position would do-I found another job.  A better job, I must add.  And...this job found me, actually.  I wasn't even looking and I got a call from them saying they'd like to meet me.  And that was that.  I went on an interview, that was about 4 hours long, and they took me out to lunch!!  How sweet is that?  Ok, so this job is in Kernersville, NC, which is closer to Greensboro.  So guess where I'm moving BACK to?  You guessed it!  GREENSBORO, NC!  It's kind of exciting because we're moving to a better part of town and it's like 15 min from my job and closer to Jeffrey's job and school.  Plus, the church we liked was in Greensboro.  We have some friends in Greensboro!!!  So, it works out better for my family in the end!  PRAISE GOD!  This company is moving me from Mebane to Greensboro and paying for EVERYTHING, as well as the money to break the lease at the apartment in Mebane.  That's what I'm talkin' bout right there!  So, it is true that ""All things work together for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose.""  I'm very thankful that it all worked out like it did because I know it could've been the other way.

Also, no bridges were burned at MM&A.  The Director of Engineering said that I could stop working when I felt ""not needed"" and they would pay the rest of the 2 weeks.  Is that God or what?  I can't thank Him more.  So, these next few weeks we will be spending packing and cleaning (AGAIN) to move to our new place in Greensboro, which we don't have yet, but the hiring agency is helping us find.  Oh yeah...that's a blessing too.  Let me tell you about that.

So, I called our rental office today (who we couldn't get in contact with for months b/c they are open M-F 9-5 and not on the weekends, plus they don't answer the phone) to tell the lady that we'd be breaking our lease for a job relocation.  The woman pretty much said it would be over $2000 to get out of the lease.  So, the staffing agency that I got the job through (and yes, it's a salary job) is fighting it as we speak.  These are the people that are also helping us find a new place.  So I pretty much don't have to worry about anything.  God is really working things out for us!  So, that's pretty much all for that...

Valencia!!!  GIRL WE ARE SINGING THE SAME SONG!  To tell you, I haven't been to church in about --let's just say it's been too long for someone who knows better.  I've felt dry and drained spiritually.  I haven't had fellowship with a saint since I saw Christina and Cyndy a few weekends ago.  I've been so busy with work (the commute is over an hour a day) and home life that I haven't made the time for God.  That's why it's so amazing that He is continuing to work things in our favor.  I feel you with the cursing thing...Ask my husband.  There have been some ""not so pretty"" words to come out of my mouth lately.  But I know exactly why.  I have been neglecting God, and in turn my character has changed, slowly but surely.  However, I thank God that He continues to love me regardless.  I know that I'm His child b/c I feel Him tugging on my heart, telling me to just sit and talk to Him.  I feel you on the ""falling out on songs.""  Girl, just about any gospel song will have me out in the floor lately.  I am definitely at a point where I miss God.  The good part about it is that, He misses me too.  He never gets to a point where He says ""fine --you forget me, I'll forget you too.""  Instead, He will cause us to have dreams, or have certain people say things to us that He's already been dealing with us in our hearts about.  That happened to me last week when my mom asked me about my spiritual walk out of the blue.  I had SO much conviction at that time that I started to cry b/c I knew I was in the wrong.  How can I not give my daughter the stable foundation that my parents gave me?  Girl, let me just tell you, I understand.  I know that all hope is not lost for us.  I'm glad that God and I are like good friends.  You can not talk to them for a REAL long time and come back as if you never parted.  You will be fine.  

Well, I guess I have exhausted everything I really needed to say.  I know it's a long one and I hope you aren't yawning right now.  I know I am.  Pray for me as I pray for you.  One."

"event","Well, I thought that I would write today because I feel I need to get out some feelings that I've been having.

Since I do not want to even mention what I experienced, I will dubb this experience as ""travesty.""  Hopefully you'll be able to understand me.

First off...I'M HIGHLY PISSED OFF!  I don't think I've been this upset in a long time.  I couldn't believe that I experienced the travesty.  I feel that no matter how much complain about it, it will never change.  So, where does that leave me?  It hurts, really bad.  It hurts to know that you're really not needed and now it's every man for himself.  I was under the impression it was a team effort, but I guess it's not.  I have requested MANY times how much I disapprove...yet the travesty keeps happening.  I WANT IT TO STOP! CEASE! NON-EXISTENT! FOREVER! GONE...

I don't know why it happens.  I don't know how it happens, all I know is that it happens, only I saw the finished product and was not a part of the process.  So, do I say, ""Screw you!  You don't need me, fine! I'm gone.""  or do I pray and ask God to help me deal with the travesty.  It seems easier to do the first one.  But I know I should do the latter...  I wouldn't be so bad if I didn't oppose it SO much.  I HATE IT WHEN IT HAPPENS! I just want it to stop.  I already don't like knowing that it happens, but REALLY don't like seeing the finished product.  It's enough to make me leave the situation.  It really is.  It's like my concerns are turned upon a deaf ear and what I have to say doesn't matter.  Most people DO leave situations like this.  I'd love to.  God won't let me.

I'm hurting so bad right now,y'all.  You have no idea.  I don't think they have any idea.  Do you know that I haven't talked to anyone all day long b/c of this?  It's like, everything has closed up inside me and even if I wanted to get it out, I can't.  I've had spells where I just go into the bathroom and cry.  God help me...I don't EVER want to experience that again...Maybe one day I'll say something about it...But today won't be the day.  I just can't find the strength to do it."

"event","Well, I'm bored AGAIN today at work.  I guess Fridays are just slow for us.  I am glad that I have a job, despite of the bordem I occasionally experience.  It IS nice to have my own office.  Speaking of which, I am going to, finally (hopefully), paint my office.  I was thinking a deep burgundy to match my degree.  I guess we'll see what happens.

My sister came into town last night.  I was SO good to see her.  She's truly blossoming into a woman who is on her way to doing great things.  I small parts of myself in her, even though she is her own individual.  She's looking more like my dad each time I see her.  That makes me smile and want to cry all in the same breath.  She really makes me miss him.  She even goes to the refridgerator and slices off a piece of cheese from the block like he does.  Crazy.  Hopefully, she and I will get a chance to just sit down and have a talk about life, etc.  I LOVE MY SISTER! :-)

I am really longing to see my husband right now.  Lately (past few months), it's been hard for us to get any kind of time together.  I'm normally tired when I get in and have to cook, get to the gym, eat, and give Nyelah a bath.  By that time, I have nothing left for my husband.  It's crazy b/c he's tired too.  Sometimes I'll come home with migraines and he has to take over and  do what I noramlly do after work.  There's got to be SOME rest for the weary.  We've traveled almost every weekend since we've moved into our apartment, which I really need to get cleaned up.

I am going to try to start seeing a loctician about my hair.  I have been doing it myself for a while; and even with all the research I've done on the web, I'm still a bit clueless on how to maintain my hair properly.  Some sites say you can use oil; some say not to use oil, but spray water on your scalp.  Besides, I'm kinda tired of doing my hair and I have the money to have someone put her hands in it for a change.  Do you know that it'll be about 10 years since someone else did my hair?  Yeah, that's a long time.  I've been doing it myself all this time.  I've gone from weaved up - to bald - to short and curly- to afro - to twists - to locs.  I can say that I love being natural.  I don't wear makeup.  I don't wear fake nails.  I have not an ounce of weave in my hair.  I am 100% natural and loving it!  I believe that if a woman can bare to look at herself in the mirror with dignity and pride without all the ""additives,"" anyone else can.  I wanted people to look at me and see myself as I saw me - big, brown, and beautifully natural.  For so long, I hid behind fake nails and fake hair (for those of you who knew me before 2001) defining myself by what I put on, all the while screaming and wanting to be free.  I wore a hair piece for about 7 years (with my hair bald in the top/middle) without ever letting it breathe and exist on its own.  When I finally whacked all my hair off and went natural, it was the biggest and BEST decision I've made besides choosing Christ.  I'd never felt so free, and that was all I wanted. 

When my husband met me, I had the fake hair.  When we dated and fell in love, he fell in love with ME, just as I was.  My hair was natural, untouched by chemicals that make my hair straight or curly.  Just nappturally beautiful.  That is one of the aspects he still loves about me today - among other things ;-)

I don't know why I shared all of that.  Maybe it was something I needed to get off my chest - or maybe it's boredem kicking in. LOL, whichever, it was who I was.  I praise God for who I am now.  I am truly grateful.

Well, in about 30 min I'm leaving work to hand deliver some documents to one of our clients in Morrisville, NC.  After that, I'm going home.  Who knows what the night may bring...Have a great weekend."

I just finished a big calucation for a coped pedestal for a railyard service area...who would've ever thought I'd actually use what I learned in school?  Not me or I would've stayed awake in class more often.  Well, it's 2006 and I'm excited about what God is gonna do for this year.  Of course, I want to lose TONS of weight this year and I'm on my way.  so far, I've lost 5 pounds and counting.  YIPPEE!!!

Trynna keep it holy!  I'm excited about the ball this year.  It's supposed to have dinner and dancing with a live jazz band.  Get it now!!!  The only downside is that it's in January...and Januarys in Blacksburg are cold and snowy...I've been trying to get them to change it to Sept or something...to no avail.  We'll see what happens.  Hopefully, God will hold back the snow just for us.  Please come out and support.

My sister is coming down today to stay for the weekend and our house is a HOLIFIED WRECK!  I've been really busy and tired when I get home.  Hopefully I'll be able to do a little something, if she doesn't get there before I do.

Well, I don't have anything else to say right now, so I'll update later.  I'm out."

"event","So, we actually ended up going to Atlanta anyways.  We didn't really have anything else to do. So let me tell you about my experience in the ATL.

Saturday:  This morning we got up and said, ""Hey...let's go to Atlanta anyway.""  Sure thing...so we packed up enough for 2 days, booked a hotel room on cheaptickets.com (it IS cheap) and left for GA.  This trip took about 5.5 hours, which was longer than I expected, but we ended up getting a room south of Atlanta, which added another 30 min to the drive.  When we got there, we unpacked our things and relaxed a bit and then headed out to the big city (after stopping off a Walmart to get a rat-tail comb so I could rebraid Nyelah's hair).  We got downtown and it was really crowded.  Instead of parking in the parking deck, we just parked on the street by a parking meter and some homeless people (Jeffrey's idea).  So yeah, I prayed REAL hard over my car before we left.  We walked down Pryor St. to get to the Underground, which is where the big peach was dropping.  We walked around and looked at the shops and stuff before we went to the food court to grab a bite to eat (and a place to chill until 11pm).  We were chillin'...eatin' some chicken wings when all of a sudden we hear loud popping sounds and table falling.  EVERYONE STARTED RUNNING (you know black people...we run.) and heading to get outside of the building.  I thought someone got shot, but it turns out some boys were going around on different levels letting firecrackers go off.  Negros...but that's not all folks.  Once 11pm hit, everyone started migrating outside to watch the peach drop.  Needless to say there was like a million people all trying to get to the same place at the same time, so we were pretty much heart to heart and breast to breast, as they say.  It was crazy.  Then a fight broke out, as if there was room for a fight.  All I know is that I saw this nappy head guy getting hauled off by some guys in SWAT-lookin' uniforms.  Why do black people not know how to act in large numbers?  I will never figure that out.  We also met this couple that was on their first date (how cute)so we made some new friends.  Hopefully when we move to Atlanta in a few years we can see them again.  I know I'll definitely call them.  After the peach dropped and fireworks stopped, we headed back to our car.  All the streets were blocked off, so we could walk right in the middle of the street.  It was nice being hand and hand with my family walking on the yellow line in the middle of the street.  I don't know why I got a kick out of that.  Anyway, we headed back to the hotel.  Nyelah was knocked out and Jeffrey and I made history...

Sunday:  Ok, so after having ""adult conversation,""  Jeffrey got ready for the day while I gave Nyelah a bath and braided her hair.  This girl has naps just like her momma.  She gave me HELL trying to braid her hair, so by the time I was done, I had hit her with the tail of the comb about 7 times.  You know that's God's divine number, so hopefully God will improve this child's tolerance for getting her hair done.  After I got Nyelah together, I got ready myself.  Then we all headed out to get something to eat in ATL.  After eating, we went over to the World of Coke, which was really nice.  I had been there once before on my mission's trip back in 2002, and there was nothing new.  It was cool though b/c experiencing things with Jeffrey and Nyelah always makes things new and exciting for me.  After we came from the Coke museum we went to get our picture taken as a family, which turned out REALLY nice.  We walked around some more before Nyelah was cutting up b/c she was sleepy.  We were gonna go to the aquarium, but we decided to lay low for the rest of the night.  After all, I had to drive the next day.

Monday:  We all got up around 5:30am to get packed and leave for NC.  IT RAINED THE ENTIRE TRIP.  Since Jeffrey had to be to work by 11:30, I had to drive while he slept.  I didn't mind.  I just didn't want to fall asleep myself.  I stopped for coffee.  I honestly don't think I would've made it without it.  I dropped Jeffrey off around 12, and Nyelah and I went home.  Jeffrey works in Greensboro, which is about 30 from Mebane, so I had another long drive.  We got home, and I fed the kitten who was SO happy to see us.  He likes to roll over so that you'll play with him.  I also cleaned his ears, which he DID NOT like, but I got done.  Jeffrey left a message on my phone saying that he was getting off early.  So I went to pick him up...as you can see, nothing else remotely exciting is happening...Therefore, I'm gonna stop right here.  I'm getting a little sleepy and all the big wigs have left for lunch.  So, I'm gonna close my door and take a little 30 min snooze.  I will talk to you all later.  Have a great day."

"event","Good morning, all!  Today is a great day to be alive.  I am at work with NOTHING to do...it's crazy that I get paid all this money to do nothing.  I guess most people would kill for my job, but believe me...it has it's days.  Last week, for instance, was one of the busiest weeks I've had at this job.  I was trying to work overtime (not really overtime for salary folks) to make up for the halfday I wanted to take Friday for Christmas.  However, MMA ended up giving me that halfday as a holiday, so the time I worked went towards the 1st half of the day.  

So, it was nice not having to work Friday.  

Soooo much has happened since I last wrote.  I turned 24!  I can't believe I'm getting so old!  Married...Mother...career engineer...I feel like I'm doing big things.  I own my car, my husband owns his...we have a BEAUTIFUL new apartment.  A new washer and dryer (Kenmore Elite front loader and dryer).  We also have a new kitten who is really cute and cuddly.  I feel like things are SUCH turnaround from how my earlier entries were.  I can't take any credit for anything that's happened to me.  God gets all the glory b/c nothing can happen without his approval.  So, yeah, I'm blessed.  Things are looking up, and I'm grateful for it.

Christmas was really good.  I bought my husband a $1399 wedding band (I know I know...but he's worth it).  I bought him some other things too (new clippers, $150 Hecht's card).  I got some cool stuff too, mostly stuff for relaxation, which is fine with me.  I've always wanted one of those fluffy terry cloth robes.  He also bought me a calligraphy set he saw me droolin over in Barnes and Noble.  I can't wait to break it open.  My dad loved calligraphy and was really good at it, so it's something I want to take up.  I also got the new Marvin Sapp CD which is off the chainz!!!  Cop that.  We (as a couple) got a deep fryer (as if I need to gain the weight I've lost)...lol and an XBox 360  YEAH BABY!  I SAID IT!  My father-in-law had to go and get something started...  So, Jeffrey and I said that since dad bought us the XBox 360 that we'd get the Playstation 3 for ourselves...the 360 can go in our bedroom and the 3 can go in the living room...:-)

Nyelah---before I tell you what SHE got for Christmas, let me remind you that she's two (2).  Ok, her grandfather got her a CD player, a writing board easel, and a Dora the Explorer TV...yeah y'all...a TV.  It's real too.  Right now, it's sitting on her chest with a portable DVD player hooked up to it.  So she sits in her room watching all her little DVDs...it's nice b/c Daddy and I can watch TV w/o being bothered about ""Clifford"" and ""Little Monsters.""  She can watch them in her room.  From my mom, she got a winter coat--size 4, it'll be a while before she outgrows it.  And...a Dora the Explorer Power Wheel...what was that?!  This girl has this mug parked beside her crib...I just don't get it.  From Jeffrey's mom, she got some MORE clothes and a new chair, which she uses to watch her DVDs in her room.  Now, people ask me, ""Does she have cable in her room?""  Answer: HECK NO!  SHE'S ONLY TWO, PEOPLE!  So yeah, my daughter is officially spoiled.

Don't think that with all this giving and getting that we didn't remember what the reason for the season is...we took time out to pray, read the passage of Jesus' birth, and pray for one another before we even opened gifts.  I think this is a tradition that I will start in my own household.

For New Year's, we are gonna chill in NC...we were gonna go to Atlanta, but we just traveled from NOVA, so we're tired of traveling for right now.  Tonight, we're gonna go to Southpoint Mall in Durham and take Nyelah to see the lights and stuff, eat dinner, and catch a movie.  We'll probably get some stuff for our bathroom too (since Nyelah's is done already--remember the ducks?).  We're just gonna relax and kickback for a bit.  Bills are paid, so that's taken care of.  I honestly don't know what to do with myself...but say that God is good. 

I'm gonna go now.  I really want to close my door and lay back in my chair for a snooze, but it's too early for that.  Oooo...I just got some work to do, so I gotta go.  Stay tight, y'all.  Keep it real.  Above all else, give thanks to God for EVERYTHING in ALL things."

Better yet, I also forgot my glasses at home...yesterday, I misplaced my keys and was 30 min late to work trying to find them.  WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON WITH ME.  As I wait for my baked potato to finish in the microwave, I'm trying to figure out what happened these past few days to make me so forgetful.  I really can't think of anything.

Well, I've lost about 2 lbs on this new diet...2 lbs in 2 weeks...good deal.  I'm hoping that it kicks up a notch this week.  I'm dreading Thanksgiving b/c I have to overcome the urge to stuff my face with everything in sight.  LORD, PLEASE help me!  I can see that my husband is becoming VERY responsive to the new change in my appearance ;-)  Way to go, ME!  That really makes me happy.  I mean, I'm cute as a big girl...imagine how cute I'm gonna be as a moderately big girl...BIG GIRLS!  I WILL NEVER LEAVE YO CHUNKY BEHINDS!  You can bank on that.  It was just getting away from me a little bit...

Anyhow, it's Tuesday, and I can't wait until tomorrow is over...THANKSGIVING!  Also, my brother's birthday is on Thanksgiving Day.  He'll finially be 18!  You ain't grown, negro.  I don't know what I'm gonna get him for his special day...probably nothing, like every year.  LOL nah, I might just give him some money, as if he needs any.  He's living off the big cash cow...my mom.  So, we'll see.

My house is a wreck!  Trying to get everything squared away is getting hard with having this new job that is almost 40 min away from my house.  It's crazy.  I get home and I'm dead tired.  So, I'm hoping that getting off some weight (and taking my vitamins everyday LIKE YOU SHOULD BE DOING...mmm hmmmm)will help.  Anyway, I'm getting hungry...so I'm gonna go.  I will talk to you all soon.

"event","Today started really early, but it was good.  First of all, I want to say that I know I was a little irritated last time I updated.  Since then, things at work have really been looking up.  While the work on my office was being done, I was moved to an empty office to wait it out.  I must say...it's definitely nice having your own office.  It was quiet and I could think while receiving drawings or trying to pick a pump.  I ate my lunch to some nice, soft music.  Then, I can close my door and sit back in my plush chair for a little snooze before getting back to work.  I am really excited about getting settled in my new office.  It's been noisey back there with all the banging and nailing going on.  Luckily for me, my temporary office is near the front of the building, away from the noise.  So yeah, everything's been much better.  I'm starting to get more work in my field, versus the picture printing.  I'm realizing that I am going to have to stand up for myself regarding the whole admin work thing.  I'm not there to make a bunch of copies or print pictures.  I'm there to do project work...So, we'll see what happens.  I'll keep you poseted.

Yesterday, I finally met up with my cousin Donna and my little cousin Josh, who is starting his first year at A & T.  We all went into Winston-Salem to do a little bit of shopping, afterwhich we went to Texas Roadhouse.  This was the first time my husband got a chance to pick out a steak at the front of the restaurant.  I could see he was pretty excited about that.  Nyelah was a good girl for a change.  I think she really likes my cousins, which is good b/c she can stay with them from time to time.  My cousin Donna and her husband don't have and children, so they can take Nyelah anytime they want.

We are supposed to be going to my Aunt Terecita's for Thanksgiving this year, and I'm glad about that.  Jeffrey is gonna get the chance to taste some REAL southern food for a change, wit his cityboy behind.  I remember bragging to him about the summer before we got together, and I promised to bring him back a plate, which I didn't (I forgot...or did I?)  So, he's getting a chance to actually go there and see the pig from start (alive) to finish (on his plate).  Sounds good, don't it?  lol...

I actually just came back from Walmart getting groceries and stuff for Nyelah's bathroom...yeah I said it.  The chick has her own bathroom, at 2.  She's blessed and doesn't even realize it.  Jeffrey and I decided to go with the rubber duckie theme, which I think is really cute.  For her room, we finally took her crib down and turned it into a bed with the little safety guards on the side.  She LOVES it.  She likes to be able to get down from her bed and play with her toys until mommy and daddy get up, which we like too.  We are doing her room in girlie butterflies and flowers.  We're also gonna be putting artwork of little black girls as decoration in her room, too.  I get tired of society wanting me to buy things for my kids that has faces of kids that don't look like them.  Jeffrey and I are coming up with some ideas for a kids clothing line...more info forthcoming.

Jeffrey has gone to work and will be back at 5 and Nyelah is gone, so I'm here at home by myself getting ready to tear into some house work around here...it feels good to finally be going in the right direction.

Last night, I cleaned up our old apartment, and we had a set of glasses and some baby stuff that we needed to get rid of (I was REALLY trying to hold onto the baby clothes, but Jeffrey wouldn't hear of it) that we were gonna donate to Good Will.  I decided to knock on my neighbor's door across the hallway to see if she wanted the glasses.  She took them like she never had glasses before, which I was thankful for.  I asked her if she knew anyone that was having a little girl b/c I had some things I needed to get rid of, reluctantly.  She said that the girl upstairs was having a little girl and was really having a hard time getting stuff for her.  Look at God!!! I gave her ALL of Nyelah's old clothes AND a bassinett.  She had tears in her eyes b/c the girl was going to be happy to receive something from someone.  It felt SO good to be able to bless someone like we had been blessed so long ago.  God is constantly teaching me things day by day, one of those things being learning how to let go so that He can bless you with something else, and therefore, allowing you to bless someone else.

Well, I'm going to get to work.  It was good seeing you all at the EGC reunion...which was off the hook!  Til next time..."

The person no one wants to eat with, talk to, joke with, or assign any real work to.  I've been sitting here for about an hour waiting for some ""supposed work"" that a co-worker said was forthcoming...well, where is it?  I mean, I am a wee bit tired of not working and getting paid for it.  I had enough of that at Vitafoam...I really assumed that I was going to get my feet wet working here.  Not saying that it isn't coming in the near future, but what do I do until then?  Since my cubicle is in the back of the common area, no one comes by to say hi, no one really talks to me.  I'm kinda tired.  Anyway, will update more later."

Nyelah is two...Jeffrey is starting school next Spring...Everything is finally all coming together, and it's WONDERFUL.  God is faithful.  I am a living witness that when you wait on Him (even when you may complain and grumble sometimes), He will ALWAYS come through for you.  People look at me and wonder how it is that I've become so successful with an unexpected pregnancy, marriage, and unemployment.  IT'S GOD!  I don't know how to explain it any other way.  So when you see me, know that I am the manifestation of God's favor, grace and mercy.  Chew on that for a while...


Oh yeah, right now I am spending my Saturday morning at Vitafoam Nonwovens helping them to get everything in order before the ""Go Live"" Monday.  I'm getting paid time and a half for it.  I know I know...I have a steady job.  However, this company has been really good to me in my time of need.  So, I'm trying to be there for them in their time of need. Even though I have to leave at 11, I am going to help as much as I can while I'm here.  Ok, well I'm gonna go.  I will be updating more often now that I am going to have internet in my new apartment (which we loooove)!!!  I'll holla.  GOD IS GOOD!"

"event","Another day another dollar...Today was a really stressful day for me...

It started with getting home from NOVA this morning at 2 am, only to get up 5:30 am to get to work.  I was kinda tired most of the day, but not as tired as I thought I would be.  There were a couple of people at work that I met for the first time (they were out the prior week on business).  One of the guys I actually got to do some work for...and this is where the saga begins...

This guy went down to MISSISSIPPI to do some investigations on some of the hurricane damage there.  Needless to say, he came back with about 600 digital photos.   What I had to do was download the pics from the camera and print them out 4-6 pics per page.  Sounds easy, right??? WRONG.  It took me til 3 pm to finish it all.  So, some of them didn't print out b/c the printer got confused b/w me and all the other people trying to print from it, too.  So, while I was at lunch, I was letting them print.  After lunch, I had to go take my drug test at the local clinic (on company time) b/c the HR lady was bugging our office coordinator for me to hurry up and get 'er done.  So, when I got back, this guy's looking at me like, ""Where have you been?""  So, so about another 145 pics hadn't printed out.  Plus they printed on the page in a way that was kinda confusing.  So, I feel like this guy is never going to ask me to do anything for him again.  I feel really bad about it (especially since I was recommended by the Branch Manager).  I don't know how I feel about that.

Then I got really swamped toward the end of the day trying to print the rest of the pics and do something for another PE in our office.  I'm just pooped and glad this day is over.  Someone please send some love or somethin'...

"event","Can I just start out by saying that it feels GREAT to finally be working in my field?!  I LOVE my new job.  Granted, I spend a total of about 3 hours on the road everyday, but it's well worth it.  Everyone here seems to be really nice.  I am the only african american in the branch (probably in the company), but that doesn't bother me; I'm used to it.  I have my own little cubicle in the back of the middle of the civil common area (pretty soon I will have my own office), where I do my work.

This week has been REALLY busy for me.  I didn't really expect to do much work this week b/c I'm new...WRONG!  I stayed busy all week long.  Going over drawings, drawing up submittals, doing research on tax credits, calling manufacturers about products from the contractor...You name it, I've probably done it this week.  But you know what?  I'M LOVING IT!  For the first time, I feel my life is finally going in a direction that I don't mind.

Jeffrey and I just got a new apartment in Mebane, NC (halfway b/w Greensboro and Raleigh), so we are pretty excited about that.  We'll probably be moving in about 1 more week.  I'm really excited.  For the first time, I like the apartment.  Normally, I'd rather be in a house, but this apartment is really nice.  It feels nice to able to finally live somewhere I am proud of.  GOD IS GOOD!

I miss my co-workers at Vitafoam.  They were really good people.  I emailed them earlier this week telling them about my first day.  They were all excited for me when they found out about the new job.  I plan to keep in touch with them for as long as I can.

Today is Nyelah's birthday!!!  She's 2 and GROWN!  She knows it's her birthday, too!  She's been going around the apartment singing ""Happy Birthday Nyelah.""  We're going to redecorate her room (ex- the Tigger theme...I'm moving that to my office :-)  We're having a party in NOVA at my mother-in-law's house.  We're exited about that.

God is doing big things in our lives and we can't wait to see what he's going to do next!  Please don't stop the prayers.  Even when things are going well, we still have to acknowledge that God has his hands in our successes.  Until next time..."

"event","I am sitting here at ""work"" doing...nothing.  Just like I've been doing for the past 3 weeks.  At least I'm getting paid, right???...well, I guess.  I would MUCH rather be at home sleeping right now, or cleaning...whatever, just as long as I'm not bored.  Sitting here makes me remember how much I want to be gone from here (the job I mean).  I am still waiting to hear something from Sue at Marshall Miller & Associates as to whether ""all systems are go.""  Part of me wants to think that I don't have the job, however, I know what God has promised me.  I've been to countless interviews trying to find the right job, or just trying to find someone that will look past my gender and skin tone to see the potential behind.  I finally think I've found the place.  Sue is the branch manager of the MM & A, so it will be nice to have a woman manager.  She's the first woman professional engineer I've met besides Dr. Watford.  Only she's MUCH nicer than Dr. Watford.  MUCH.  I'm waiting...trying to be as patient as I can be.  All I'm waiting for is the ok.  That's all I need.

I just want to get out of here.  I like the people at the job I have now.  They are really nice.  They've been good to me, and I will be forever grateful to them for that.  They extended the job for me until I found something.  Half the time we spend playing games and on the internet, all while getting paid.  I can say I've made about $300 doing absolutely NOTHING.  I'm thankful, and I can't complain.  I'm just ready to embark on my career journey.  Yes, I said career.  This is no longer a job...but it's what I've been wanting to do most of my life (since 6th grade).  I still can't believe that I'm gonna be a real engineer.  People said I couldn't do it.  Most didn't think I would finish b/c I got married and had a child...heck, I didn't even think I'd finish.  But God is SO faithful.  He gave me a great support system of encouragement, and I finally got my degree.  If only my dad could be here...Part of me wants to be upset that he's not.  However, I'd much rather him be where he is than down here suffering with his heart condition.

Today, it was brought to my attention that there are people that really don't have faith in what they believe.  It's like a story...maybe Hansel and Gretel (sp?)  Not something that is truth to them.  People question the validity of God.  They believe that there is more than one way to get to heaven.  I am SO glad that regardless of what I see and experience, I KNOW that God is real b/c of how He's shown Himself strong in my life.  I know that God is real.  Part of me is sad for those that don't really have any direction.  I pray for them that they would find the way.  I realize that everyone won't be Christian, and that's fine.  But if a person is willing to earnestly seek God, they will find Him.  I don't claim that I know it all and that I'm some goody-two-shoes that hasn't done anything wrong b/c those of you who know me KNOW that's a lie.  But I know that there is one entity that has remained constant in my life and that is God.  People that say that believe in Him and yet question Him are not living as they should.  I know that if they were, God would show up b/c He has for me, EVERY TIME.  Well, that's enough of that.  Just some food for thought.

Valencia, girl you bless me on the deepest levels.  I read your journal from a few days ago and I couldn't believe how moved a person could be just off a few lines of a song.  That's how God is.  He doesn't need long, dry sermons to reach a person.  Only a few short moments of time.  I started to wonder how I really felt about myself.  I'm so busy with my life that I haven't taken the time to evaluate myself.  I do have issues with my physical appearance and often lack confidence within myself.  God is working on me...

Christina, I am so glad you found a church.  I had been looking for one myself.  I went about a whole month without going anywhere and it has really taken a toll on me.  It's hard when you are in tune with the move of God.  You feel lost and out of the loop.  You can't hear Him if He speaks.  It feels as if you are all alone.  Anyhow, the church I'm attending now is called Evangel COGIC (Church of God in Christ), and it's pretty nice.  I do think it's a little bigger than I'd like, but I'm in a town where I don't know many people, and the ones I know go to church that I really don't care too much for.  It's been hard getting out of that bed on Sunday mornings.  I'm so tired from the work week and weekends (cleaning, cooking, washing clothes)...but God loves a sacrifice.  If I can get up for work at 6:15 am every morning, then I can get up at 8 am Sunday morning and take some time to give thanks to God for all of the blessings I have.  I CAN say that we've been faithful in paying tithes, which is something I've longed to do for while.  It's an honor to give God a portion of what He's given me - it's the least I can do.

Anyway, this was much longer than I anticipated, so I'll go and try to find something else to do.  I'm excited about seeing some old friends Nov 11 for the EGC reunion.  It's gonna be fun.  Until next time..."

Life's been good lately, God is good, and lastly, I can't complain.  My husband and daughter are doing well.  I'm doing well.  I may have a job opportunity.  I had a second interview yesterday that went REALLY well, so I'm waiting to hear back from the lady today.  More than likely, I have the job.  The lady said that after she checked my references and everything came out ok, I could start Monday.  Let's just pray that my references are having good days.  If in the event I get the job, I will have to move, probably to Mebane NC since the job is in Raleigh.  I'm excited!  Keep praying for me.

My dreads look LOVERLY!!! hehehe...it's exciting to watch them go through the stages and things.  If you're going to the EGC reunion, you'll see me with them there.  Anyway, I'm at work now so I gotta go.  Rachel, if you're looking, HEY GIRL!!!

Umm...yeah, I'm still in Greensboro, and yeah, I'm still looking for a job that suites me and my qualifications.  Right now, I'm still working that temp job I was telling you about earlier.  They extended the job for me until I found something else, so the favor of God is heavy upon me!  THANK YA!  So, I'm still doing data entry stuff and my carpel tunnel swells up sometimes b/c of it...OUCH!  

How about I have this guy from this company in Richmond that's after me hard for a job, but I'm here in Greensboro.  So, I might be relocating back to Richmond if things go well.  However, Jeffrey wants to still go to school at NC A & T...bummer.  I'm trying to convince him to go elsewhere for the sake of us being able to pay our bills, but he's not budging.  We'll see what happens.

Oh yeah, I'm locking my hair (smile).  Exciting stuff.  I've been growing these little dreadies for about a month now and they are cute already.  It really is a journey b/c they are going from individual strands to locs of hair.  It's neat.  Some of them have actually locked already.  I'll keep you posted as to how I'm doing with that.

I guess that's all for now.  My break is almost over...back to the grind!  Later."

"event","Yeah, I know it's been a minute.  A lot's gone on.  Graduation - move to Greensboro - unemployment - temp job...the whole nine.  As of right now, I'm working a temp job for a company called Vitafoam.  All I'm going to say is that I need to get paid more for what I do.  Needless to say, I'm bored.  I mean, I graduated with a degree in engineering and I'm doing mindless work.

Before this job, I was unemployed for what seemed like FOREVER.  Every engineering firm I contacted either wasn't hiring or need more from me...EIT and 2 years of experience, of which I have neither.  So, it seems like a constant downward spiral that I'm sliding on.  I'm beginning to wonder when things will look up.  I know they will.  I'm finding it hard to stay encouraged, knowing that God is with us.

Right now, Nyelah's with my mom in Richmond.  I miss her terribly.  She's all I know.  I think about her most of the day (when I'm not thinking for my ""mindless"" job).  I wonder if she thinks of me like that??

I'm just ready for a change.  I think that God is trying to teach me some things about life.  He's trying to teach me that things come in His time, not mine.  No matter how qualified I THINK I am for something, He is the One that makes it happen.  Being judgmental of others is not cool.  No matter how HOLY I think I am, I can't forget where God has delivered me from.  No matter how dismal my situation seems, someone always has it worse than me.  GOD IS ALWAYS WITH ME.  Even when I don't feel Him moving.

Anyway, if you know the words of prayer, pray my strength in the Lord.  I'll try to keep up more with this thing.  I know, I say that all the time. 

Oh yeah, to all beginning another semester in school, stay strong.  It won't be long til you graduate.

Well, this is the homestretch.  I am finally to a point where I am at peace with graduation.  To make a long story short, I wasn't sure if I was gonna be walking the platform May 14th...you remember that class I told you about.  As it turns out, I didn't need to worry about that one b/c there was another I was actually failing.  Pretty much, I passed with a D.  Praise God... D = done.  That's all I'm really concerned with right now.  Sume Cum Laude...whatever...""Thank ya Lordy.""  I should see if I can get that written beside my name somewhere in the program.  So, graduation is a reality to me now.  I'll actually be walking across the stage.  I'm really excited.  I think it's hit me that I'm leaving, and that alone is enough encouragement to cause me to want to ace all my exams :-D.

For the past 2 months, I've been travelling back and forth to Greensboro trying to move all of our belongings down there a little at a time.  It's finally all down there, except me and a few bags.  It feels good to know that I'm starting life in a city I'm unfamiliar with.  It's like an adventure, but it's even better b/c I have my husband and child with me.  I thank God for them.

So, pretty much as I'm typing this I'm getting excited.  I am finally going to be united with my family again!  After more than 2 months of visiting, we will finally be together again.  I miss my daugther like crazy.  It was a little easier to get to NC than to Richmond, so I saw Jeffrey much more than I saw Nyelah. I called her a lot though.  I know that when she see's me, she's not going to know what to do with herself.  I won't either, in all actuality.  I hear she's gotten really big and is talking.  What Imma do with that?  When I left her, she was just learning to say mommy and daddy.  It's all too much.  Praise God for the reunion that's about to occur in less than four days.

I think I've stressed enough about how I miss my husband.  I just saw him Mother's Day weekend!!!  I went down there b/c he said he had a surprise for me.  It was nice.  He bought me some really expensive perfume from Paris Hilton...smells SO good.  Then he took me to Macaroni Grill...can I just say that place is heaven on earth for fat people...let me tell ya.  I've never gotten real perfume from any body before him.  I really don't give that man enough credit.  He's unlike any man I've ever met before.  Baby, I'm SO glad it was you in the plan for me.

Oh yeah, so Lamar and Amy got engaged last week!!!  Congrats!  That's an awesome union, y'all.  You all bless me when I see you.  Get ready for the ride of your life!!!  (It's a good ride, just hang in there)

So, pretty much, I'm ecstatic.  God is making Himself real to  me in SO many ways.  Unfortunately, I can't always reveal what God has shared with me, but know it's good things...great things!  Hopefully I'll get the chance to update again before I graduate.  I have 2 more exams Wednesday and then I'M DONE!  I pray God's blessings upon all who read this on exams this week.  Blow 'em out of the water!!!  I'm out..."

That will give me some time to try and make a decision, anyways. Also, it is the nice thing to do. Mostly the time thing. lol I just really hate having to work at 4am and thus going to bed early. Nyar. I mean.. I usually don't even go to bed until 10 or 10:30, but I also have to take a nap, and other people I hang out with like to/usually can at night. Grar. Plus, I like being up at night. 'tis cool. 

Anyhow.. I would say more but I think I would rather hang with Brian over here. Huzzah."

"event","So.. right now I'm waiting on a call from Brian for him to tell me that he's on his way here. I've had coffee, I was already anxious, I'm by myself now (I got dropped off by people I was hanging out with) and everybody here has gone to bed already. 

Uhhhhraarrrgh. Perhaps I should go make myself something to eat and then consume it. My stomach is feeling rather empty and that would probably help make it feel better. It's churning around, empty, and feels sick. Alright I suppose I'll go do that. but for some reason food sounds bleh right now. Just cuz of anxious+sick feeling. Let's hope food=better. *crosses fingers*

Well to anyone who may possibly read this ever, you probably won't hear from me again for awhile. Not sure how long but surely not as often as lately.

So until then, good day, good night etc..

"event","I guess I actually didn't do my whole posty thing yesterday.. or earlier today. Whatever you want to call it, technically yesterday because it's after midnight. I suppose I am still doing my nighttime posting, it's just later since I don't have work tomorrow. Or errmmmrmmmmmm.... today.. now. Haha, I would have to be there and working in 5 minutes. :P Lorvely. hee hee hee I always love when that happens; I stay up late enough that before I go to bed I see the time I should be getting to work. : )

Oooh and I got to meet somebody new today.. and make kandi with her (also Wolfe and Stu). Her name is Alli. She's neat. She said she was going to stalk me on myspace but I managed to do it first, haha. :P Also, I have her number because I had to call it on my cell phone so we could find hers. Incidentally, because of the same thing she also has mine now. haha She even gave me a condom, a her pleasure one, too! Oh and she's got big boobies, which I felt. One thing that sucks, though, is it sounds like she lives in the valley. Bummer. About 45 minutes to an hour away from Anchorage. -.-'

Overall today wasn't too bad. I even got to go to Red Robin with Crystal today. Baked potato soup (minus bacon), yum. It's always weird going there and getting a check that actually has to be paid instead of just signed. Haha, hooray for my boyfriend's dad owning Alaska Red Robins. At least he is good for something (the dad, not the boyfriend lol). :P XD

So Brian gets back fairly soon now! But not nearly soon enough.. Grrr! *shakes fist* It's never soon enough......... hehe and I guess when he gets back on the 8th it's earlier in the morning than I thought. Might even be early morning 8th, late night 7th. I hope so, that would be most excellent. The sooner the better, of course. :D Sleeping that night/earlier that day is going to be very tough. Hopefully I'll at least manage a nap earlier on. 'twould be nice. I'm sure Brian will be tired, too anyways so after we do stuff for awhile we can sleep/nap together. : )

"event","So today so far hasn't been too bad. Work was okay, got help getting some of my stuff done from Loriana, yay. : ) Ooooh, and I snuck away from a customer so I could go clock off, haha. He had been waiting for like a minute, he turned his back, I got out of there! lol As it was I clocked off a minute late, no not terrible but I had things to do. :P 

Anyhow.. so now I'm just sitting here playing Sims Castaway again and doing laptoppy stuffs inbetween. Fun, fun, fun. :D 

Later time update:

So Jen and Kiler randomly came and picked me up today. We went to Wolfe's, smokey smoked a bit, then watched a movie while eating those little Totino's pizzas. He just made three one after the after and gave everyone slices. It was perfect because there was time inbetween and I wasn't just sitting there stuffing my face, my stomach had time to settle. : ) 

Oh and it was Suicide Circle we were watching. Yay. Technically a terrible movie, but I love it. Anyhow, I should really be getting to bed now. I've just begun to really like my nightly livejournal posts. Has me kinda looking back on the day and re-evaluating it, or venting/ranting if it was bad.

So good night to all! -hearts-

"event","finally, for the end of the.. what is this now..... like two and a half week period that shouldn't have even happened in the first place. -.-' Been trying to skip those pills on the birth control, my body decided it still wanted to have a period and got pissed off so did it for extra long. But it seems to be pretty much over now so yay. I at least wanted it to be gone before Brian gets back, lol. 

Now I just have to work on getting over this damned sickness. It's already been awhile so I figure 5 days should be long enough for me to do it, eh? Just keep up with the vitamins and water, I suppose. I'm still taking some medicines here and there, but not a lot because they never seem to do much for me. I figure it can't hurt. *shrug* I think I feel like I'm getting better, though.. or maybe a different cold that is slightly less bad.. hmmm. Oh well. As long as I'm better before Brian gets back I don't really care all that much. :P 

Can't really think of much else to say about today, ummmm.. Work wasn't so terrible but it was a little sucky at the end because my manager took a damned party platter in the last part of our shift. We managed, though it was weird. It was rushed, plus we were out of a few things we needed so had to improvise, had to look around for some other things which we began to think we didn't have, started to improvise, then realized we had it, AND I still had my original shit that wasn't quite finished yet. I did okay, though. I mean it would've been better if I'd had time for one more thing, but survival is possible for tomorrow, and shouldn't be so terribly bad. I'll make the best of it, anyways, and just not stress out about it. Thanks to Brian, I am actually able to accomplish that. Once again, thank you Brian! -hearts-

Other than that I napped, played Sims Castaway, and got to hang out with Wolfe for awhile. Not terribly exciting stuff, but cool nonetheless.

Well I'm starting to feel a little woozy from that melatonin AND Benadryl, so I suppose it's nighty night time for me. Little bit earlier than I've been getting to it. Yay for me. :D (hopefully it works out well)

"event","So they yelled at me at work today. They called me into Dewayne's office and when I came in the guy said something along the lines of ""So, uh, what happened yesterday?"" and he just had this condescending fucking tone like I was all the way back in fucking grade school. I knew what he was talking about and I was just thinking ""You gotta be fucking kidding me.."" So anyways, I guess the problem was that I supposedly had requested the 1st off and got denied because it was a holiday/blackout time. Bullshit. I do NOT fucking remember requesting that day off, and don't see why I would have thought to before. Even for new year's, I didn't think about doing anything for it. So.. ugh whatever. Not to mention, funny enough, I actually have been sick only I've been working and this time I didn't. O0o0o0o0o. Gah. Anyhow he told me stuff like ""blah blah blah, very serious, blah blah blah, you're really lucky you aren't getting suspended for three days right now."" I knew it. I fucking knew it. Dealing with getting shit done (that needs to be done) without me would be just way too difficult. Oh, and then he had the fucking balls to lie right to my fucking face. He said I was smart. UGH, FUCK YOU. Utter bullshit. Okay maybe it isn't as bad as I've always previously thought.. I'm getting better. but I do still think that it's at least partially bullshit (be proud of me, Brian, that's better than I usually am and you know it.. I love you for that and so much more, of course).

Oh, and on a better note: Thank you so much, Brian. You make me a stronger person. You've helped me in more ways than I could ever say, and I don't know how I could ever repay you. Thus, I resolve to do my best every day. I love you.

Well, anyhow.. I needs to get to bed. Sleep is good. I wish I didn't have to right yet, but oh well. Good whatever to you all. -hearts-

"event","I... can't really talk right now. I just.. Here's a survey, goddamnit. I don't feel like trying to put it in an lj-cut right now. Sorry.. Maybe later.

-----------

1. What did you do in 2007 that you'd never done before?:
Well I suppose I graduated and.. well the only other things I can think of I don't really want to say here, lol. but there's been some good ones, haha. oooh most recent, I actually got to spend Christmas with Brian. : )

2. Did you keep your New Year's resolutions, and will you make more for next year?:
Don't think I made any last year, don't really plan on it this time, either. I think ""resolutions"" should be made as needed and not pushed off until the end of the year. Though I suppose it's easier to do it that way for some. ""New year, new life"" is just an easier concept to grasp then ""hey I need to change now I should probably do it""

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?:
Naw, that was October last year.

4. Did anyone close to you die?:
My poor little iguana, V. That still makes me sad today.

5. What countries did you visit?:
None but my own.

6. What would you like to have in 2008 that you lacked in 2007?:
To have my own place with Brian and a few other things I won't rant on about now. Mostly I want for him to be able to do what he needs to do and for us to get our asses in gear.

7. What dates from 2007 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?:
Hmmm. Graduation, I suppose, just because it's a big deal to be finally out of high school and all. Ummm.. getting my first job...... Other than that the only things I can mention aren't specific, just in general having the best time being with Brian, cuddling, etc..

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?:
Being able to feel good about something I did, and actually be proud of me for doing something good for myself. 

9. What was your biggest failure?:
Hmmm. Not sure. 

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?:
Mental, as always.. I'm sick right now still, actually.

11. What was the best thing you bought?:(was bought for you)
Laptop, camera, stuff! lol again some things I won't mention but let's just say I love my boyfriend a lot

12. Whose behaviour merited celebration?:
Brian for being so damn sweet sometimes, always having this strange and awesome ability to surprise me in wonderful ways, for dealing with my shit, and most of all not just supporting me but actually helping me through my shit and forcing me to better myself/do things for me.

13. Whose behaviour made you appalled and depressed?:
Mine. There are others, I suppose, but mostly my own. 

14. Where did most of your money go?:
Ummmmmmm.... ... ?

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?:
A few raves, Brian, ummm.. my laptop? lol

16. What songs will always remind you of 2007?:
I don't know. I don't think songs remind me of whole years, usually. Meh.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:

i) ...happier or sadder?:
Definitely a lot happier with life. All credit for that goes to Brian.

ii) thinner or fatter?:
Hmmmm, probably thinner, I think.

iii) richer or poorer?:
Waaaaaaay richer, I have a job, still live with my parents, and am not in school yet. Don't worry, I applied for school starting this summer and plan on getting out as soon as possible. So that just means waiting for my boyfriend to build up enough money to do it with me. I think I have more than enough. I can be patient, though. I can wait for him.....

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?:
I don't know and I really don't care. I'm not going to spend time wishing I had done differently when it's already too late. Leastways I'm going to try not to. Regretting past mistakes is a waste of time and is just plain sad and depressing.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?:
See above answer.

20. How will you be spending Christmas?:
I spent it with my boyfriend, going around different places.

Where is 21?

22. Did you fall in love in 2007?:
In late 2006, actually.. but it really built in 07 so I suppose I could just say yes..

23. How many one night stands?:
Zero, thanks. I stick to my lovely, thanks.

24. What were your favourite TV programs?:
Didn't watch much TV, actually.

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?:
I dunno, I don't really want to think about it. Hate=anger and I don't want to be angry.

26. What was the best book you read?:
*shrug*

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?:
I don't know.

28. What did you want and get?:
I don't know all I can think about is Brian, I am so pathetic!

29. What did you want and not get?:
Again, I don't really want to think about that. Sadness. No. Stop it.

30. What was your favourite film of this year?:
Dunno.

31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?:
I was 18. I got my tongue pierced.

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?:
Don't know, don't care, doesn't matter.

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2007?:
.... me? Always different. Yeah. 

34. What kept you sane?:
Brian. I would be in a very bad place without him.

35.Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?:
Racquel Reed, I suppose.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?:
Hmmmm, I might have to steal the answer from the person I stole this survey from and say gay marriage. That is probably it anyhow. Gah. Fucking people.

37. Who did you miss?:
Loffley lover. He is still on a damned trip.

38. Who was the best new person you met?:
Ummmmmmmmmm.... Was it just this year I met Wolfe? Perhaps him. Steven is also really cool. Ummm... yeah.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2007:
I can't just feel bad about myself and I have to do things for me.

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:
Well I can't do that. You ask too much. <--- agreed

41. What was your favorite moment of the year?
Just cuddling with Brian in general. That's the best thing I can imagine right now.

42. What was your least favourite moment of the year?
Won't mention any of 'em here.

43. Where were you when 2007 began?
At my house reading webcomics.

44. Who were you with?

45. Where will you be when 2007 ends?
I was in the car with my friend.

46. Who will you be with when 2007 ends?

Let's not do that.

53. Did you treat somebody badly in 2007?
Yes but it doesn't really matter now.

54. Did somebody treat you badly in 2007?
Yes.

56. How much money did you spend in 2007?
A lot, I suppose. 

57. If you could go back in time to any moment of 2007 and change what?
Everything I've done or not done makes who I am. There's no point wishing to change the past. <-- agreed 

58. What are your plans for 2008?
Moving out with my boyfriend, continuing to make money, go to school, .... have an awesome time with Brian and cuddle a lot. lol

"event","I miss him SO much. and it's ridiculous. I just feel so fucking pathetic. Maybe I am, but I can't even help it. I don't think anybody understands how much that boy has done for me. It actually took awhile for me to fully realize it. I guess it's not even like I can't survive without him, it's just that I really really fucking don't want to. It's like life isn't quite right or even very exciting without him. To me there is nobody as interesting as he is. I don't really like being around other people anywhere near as much as I LOVE being around Brian. It's very difficult to say for sure what it even is. I guess it doesn't matter except that that is true. I suppose it's all I need, but that's hard to deal with when he's working and stuff and way more so when he's not even in the country let alone anywhere near me. It's such a weird transition going from us together constantly, to together whenever we can be between work and sleeping schedules, to him not being around at all because he's on a trip. I know it's just a two week trip but it's still fucking weird. Especially since I didn't think he would be on any trips for a long while since he just got a job. Not to mention that he didn't even fucking know about it, let alone me, until like a week or so before they left. Would've been nice to know, right? Day after fucking Christmas going on a cruise through the Panama Canal.. what the fuck. That's sort of a big thing to know. He ask for favors from the damned higher ups so he could quite then be re-hired when he comes back. What the hell. and I had to be left the goddamn day after Christmas.... and I didn't get to have him around for new year's even AGAIN. It really shouldn't be a big deal to me (new year's eve) and I guess it isn't, it just feels shitty when everybody else is having fun, doing their whole midnight kiss thing and making it fun, and I'm just fucking sitting over here missing my boyfriend and wishing that we could at least spend the time together. What the fuck. You know what I did last New Year's when he was in Mexico? I was sitting at my fucking computer just reading stupid goddamned webcomics. What the hell is that shit? Nothing compared to the one before it.. I was going out with somebody else completely (two boyfriends ago, in fact) and I was at my first rave. What a fucking change that is, right? I love my life with Brian in it.. sucks that he can't be there for shit like this. It's not his fault at all. He didn't even sound very excited about the cruise. He actually almost sounded like he didn't want to go. At the very least all I know was that he seemed sad to leave me. Like it would be okay if he could at least steal me along. He even got to go to Hawaii with me when I went. I mean, what the fuck? I know I'm just complaining a lot and it's kind of ridiculous, but whatever. I don't really care. I guess I'm just ranting and it makes me feel a little bit better, I think. At least it's something to do. Writing is good, I suppose. It's a way to get shit out without becoming violent or loud. Typing has always been a comforting thing for me. Maybe that's not the right word for it, or I'm just not feeling that right now.. Whatever. Doesn't matter. 

In any case I decided tonight that I should learn German. I've always loved the language, just the sound and everything, and I had thought briefly about taking the class but never did. So I'm going to probably learn some online and perhaps take a course in college. Woot for me. I need to do something like that for my brain, improve myself. I always think that I won't be able to learn another language, that I can't do shit like that.. but who knows, maybe I can. The least I can do is try. It might work just because I'm actually interested in it. We'll see what happens. Well dang I still need to wait like 5-10 minutes before I call in to work. Waiting sucks. I was going to go to sleep for awhile and just wake up to an alarm, call, and then go back to sleep.. but then I got here and there was still a few things I needed to do so it seemed like a short enough time that there was really no point in trying to sleep first. So I figured I'd wait, but it's hard because I'm really fucking tired. Ugh. and I shouldn't sleep in too too much either, otherwise I won't be able to get to sleep tomorrow night before work the next day. lol fucked up shit, oh well. At least not working today will help. :P ooh man, it's finally 4. I could call in now but I was sort of thinking that I should wait until like 5 minutes after. I dunno.

Just called in! Yay. Off the hook, that was nothing. Shitty of me, but whatever. I feel like shit, have had no sleep, and Greg is leaving in awhile. Fuck work. hahaha

Good night, all.

Guess I'll have to though, huh? hehe I'm still surviving without him, though just barely. lol just kidding (or am I?) It's been a lot easier with people (okay mainly Crystal) to occupy me. One thing that's kinda cool about people leaving each other on trips is that when the one gets back they get to have this awesome reunion and appreciate each other so much more. It's an excuse to be extra happy, too.

Oooh and speaking of people I still have some Christmas gifts to give out. Oops. Oh well. I don't really mind giving late presents. ""It's the thought that counts,"" and ""better late than never,"" right? lol I haven't even talked to them in awhile. :S 'sokay, I don't think they'll hate me. At least I hope not. Perhaps tomorrow when I get off work since Wolfe is off we both can hang out for awhile and go to the trailer at least briefly and I can be all ""Yay, present-ness!""

Yeah, that's probably what I'll do.

"event","So today has been pretty cool. Awhile after I got off work I got to go get a pedicure with my sister-in-law. Then we went to lunch and shopped for a shirt that I can wear to our family picture thing tomorrow. I'm so sad Brian isn't going to be in town for it. They were saying he could be in it but he's on a damned cruise. Away from me. :( Anyhow, I also got to take a nap and sometime soon we're also going to leave to go see Sweeney Todd. Should be pretty good.

It's really nice that Crystal been doin' stuff to keep me busy so I'm not just sitting around missing Brian and being sad. She understands how it is. What's nice is she's pretty much always available as long as there's somebody to watch the baby. Even then we can have the baby along as well. 

Oooh and Brian actually got to call me today while he was waiting for it to take off. Guess he it ends up he does have roaming? I don't know. All I know is that I was able to talk to him before he left Florida for the cruise and that made me really happy. :D Unfortunately he won't be able to call me when he's actually on the cruise (10 freakin' days!) since there's obviously no cell phone towers. Apparently there is internet on the ship but it's six dollars a minute (or something ridiculous like that). He said that he would try to send me an e-mail or two (maybe talk to his dad about giving him some money for it) but obviously I understand if he doesn't. 

So perhaps I should get off muh laptop. Or at least at some point soon. hehe

"event","So Brian left for his trip to a cruise through the Panama Canal this morning. Two weeks, he's back on the 8th. Grrrr. We didn't even know about it until about a week ago, his parents neglected to tell him even though they've apparently been planning it for about a year. :P 

Looks like I'm going to be having a really exciting time for awhile. Meh. I should get myself out of the house. It's too depressing."

"event","So today isn't very exciting. Brian is working late, as in I'll be asleep or at least will be going to sleep for work tomorrow by the time he is off. *shakes fist* Oh well, he has tomorrow off so we will be able to do stuff then. :D It is sort of nice and relaxing to be able to just sit around and play video games/go online for a day. hehe 

Ooh and I bought POTC 3 today and got a free two liter bottle of coke AND a box of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn. I almost didn't grab the free stuff because I don't really want it (don't drink soda and popcorn gets stuck in my teeth/retainers.. too irritating to deal with most of the time) but I figured my family and anybody else that comes around my house might enjoy it. Heck I might even bring one of those bags of popcorn to the trailer sometime. Yeah.. that sounds like a good idea. :P

So nothing else terribly exciting to note. I'm almost done with Christmas/Birthday shopping. I only have... my dad for Christmas and birthday, my brother for his birthday, Brian for his birthday (although that's on hold for awhile and he already knows what it is), Jen, and my other brother for Christmas. I think that's it. Maybe Alfie and Kyler as well? hmmmm... oooh yeah I know what I could get them. Sweet. Hmmm.. now that I think about it my list of people to buy for is a bit longer than I had thought but it's not so big of a deal because I at least know what to get them (and they're not terribly difficult things to find.)"

"event","Overtime tomorrow. But, it's only from 7am-11am so not too bad because 1. I don't even have to wake up as early as usual (4am) 2. I still get off earlier than I would/it's only 4 hours and number 3. I don't have to deal with lunch rush!! *celebration wiggles* Unless of course they decide before I leave it's bad enough that they want me to stay an extra hour or two. That wouldn't even be so terrible, but I'd rather not. They probably won't anyways. *crosses fingers* I just worked six days in a row, so it's not like I'm being lazy or something. I've also got stuff I've been really needing to do like getting a dentist appointment because my teeth still hurt a little, getting a vet appointment for my ferret because I still haven't gotten him checked out, and also getting myself a doctors appointment because of my sharp stomach and chest pains for the past however many months which have been becoming more frequent. Heck, maybe I'll even be able to get the dentist to actually do something for my jaw this time, too. Doubt it, though. Nyar. In any case I'm glad I at least got to have a good time last night and I have the day off today. Oooh and tomorrow I get off early enough to hang out as well. Yaaay *dance-wiggle*. :D In any case, Brian isn't going to be here for awhile, so I'm going to steal a survey from subliminalx66 and do it. :P


<lj-cut text=""End of Summer Survey"">1. Did you have a random hookup this summer?
Naw

2. Go on vacation?
Hawaii with Brian! Oh yeah.. and my family, too. My brother got married. Yup.

3. Spend the night in a hotel with a friend?
Not a friend, but my boyfriend for two weeks.

4. Did you go to any camps?
No.

5. Did you have to take summer school?
Haha no, I'm done with school! That is, until I do college.. mebbe next semester?

6. Did you get heartbroken?
Nope.

7. Any fights with friends?
Not really. Well.. maybe a little with one? Not uber bad real serious stuff in any case.

8. Was your birthday over the summer?
Close, it's in April.

9. Did you go to any parties over the summer?
Raves, woot. :D

11. What illegal things did you do?
Ummm.. no comment? lol There was at least 3 or more different types, though. That's all I'll say over something public. :P

12. How many surveys did you fill out?
How the fuck am I supposed to remember? and I'm not counting. Not near as many as last summer, though, I know that. I had/have a boyfriend that actually lives in my state now. 

13. Did you go over your minutes?
Don't think so, I don't talk on my cell phone much. but there's been more texting than normal. Oops.

14. Did you go shopping?
A few times.

15. Did you do your hair and/or nails?
I got my hair cut/done in.. June and my toenails before Hawaii in July. I need to get my hair cut again. I want to do a mohawk, but I might wait until after I move out if I decide to do it.

16. Sing?
Hell yes. Not to say I'm any good, I'm terrible. 

17. Did you go to a barbecue?
Ummm.. maybe?

18. Any friends really piss you off over the summer?
Yeah. Boyfriend, too. Hmmm. Oh well, I suppose.

19. What time did you usually go to bed?
Before work, varied. Probably between 3 and 5 am. After, between 7 and 9 pm. 

20. What was the latest you ever stayed up over the summer?
Well last month I stayed up for about 4 days because I couldn't sleep. Sucked going to work like that. -.-'

21. What time did you usually wake up?
Between 10am and 2pm. Earlier times were because my mom was being a bitch. Nyar. There was some even earlier wake-ups in Hawaii.. but it's Hawaii so that's okay. lol

22. What was some memorable things about this summer?
Being with Brian, raves, hanging with friends, making new (sorta) friends, Hawaii, and finally getting a job. 

23. Who did you meet this summer?
Specifically? A bunch of people.. mostly at *dramatic music* THE TRAILER! lol

24. Did you have a job over the summer?
Not till the end somewhat recently.

25. Lose something this summer?
Definitely. I tend to do that a lot. Without finding it? Not sure, but probably.

26. Did you go to any ice cream places?
I went to Coldstone for the first time! It was so good.. my ice cream fucking tasted like cake!

27. Did you get sick?
Yeh, felt sick a lot. Never did the staying home thing, though. I don't like staying home, especially if I'm able to hang out with people.

29. How about a mountain?
No, I didn't get any mountains this year.. but I saw quite a few like I always do since I live in Alaska, lol.

30. What was the most expensive restaurant that you went to over the summer?
Ummm... Orso's maybe? Or.. the... one next to Moose's Tooth whose name I can remember? I don't know, something with Brian's parents, though.

31. Have you gotten your schedule for school yet?
No, not going to school. Maybe next semester.

32. Are you pleased with it?
Stfu, see above answer. Assuming bastards!

33. Are you afraid of school honestly and what might happen?
Wtf. lol

34. Do you have any doubts in the back of your mind on whether or not you'll pass?
Oh dear..

35. Are you going to the same school as last year?
Noooo I'm graduated. Grr.

36. Have you started practices for sports, band, theatre etc. for school
No, no school. I don't/didn't do school activities anyways.

37. Did you go see any new movies in the theatre?
A ton, my boyfriend gets regal tickets from his dad a lot.

38. What was the most serious conversation you had about?
There was a bunch, but they were all with Brian. I don't remember what the <i>most</i> serious one was, but I wouldn't say here anyways. :S

39. Has anything personality wise and/or physically change this summer?
Yeah. Can't pinpoint it right now because I'm tired and such. Too lazy, and I have an excuse so leave me alone, damnit. 

40. Was this summer better than last summer?
Tons. I actually saw and hung out with people a lot (even if there was only a few). Especially having a boyfriend that's actually living in my state!! lol

</lj-cut>


So.. now that that's over with I'm going to chat with these people who are actually talking to me on MSN. Yaaay. :D People actually talking to me...... it makes me so happy!! *dances*"

"event","Yeah, it's not the best job for sure, but at least I have one now. It's doing deli service at Fred Meyers, 4am to 1pm. At $10.30 an hour, not too bad. Saturday should be my first day without a trainer. I'm a little nervous about remembering what I need to do, how to do it, and where to find everything. Everybody that I work with is really nice and helpful though, so I should be fine. I figure that even if I end up really hating it, I'll stick with it for a few months just to have some job experience. At least it would make it easier to find a 2nd job. People always want some kind of work experience.. bleh. >< 

So anyways..... I'm going to go back to watching Bizarre Foods on the travel channel with Brian. (I have a really big urge to eat something at least somewhat strange now!) :D"

I'm so excited, I can't wait. *bounces* Not much other news. Oooh, except that I got to play with Brian's keg, although it was only partially filled with water. It's pretty hard because it's big, awkward, has a thick part that you have to hold, and most of all the water SLOSHES around. It was hard getting it up to my chest, but I managed to get it above my head a few times. *wiggle* What really sucked, though, was when Brian suggested I throw out my hips and then my chest (that's a bad way to describe it, but whatever) and ended up hitting my crotch on the keg. -.-' Fortunately it wasn't too bad, and only hurt for a little while. Times like that make me SO happy that I'm not a guy. XD Later at my house my brother decided that he wanted to measure biceps. Mine was twelve and a half inches.. he had only half an inch on me. :D It made me so happy because not only am I a chick, but I haven't even been working out for that long. hehe. I, of course, do not want to be a big muscly person, but it was just cool."

"event","Grar, I don't update this as much as I mean to. I think the only time I updated everyday (or close to) was last summer when I had nobody to hang out with.. lol. In any case I can't wait for next month! From the 11th to the 24th I get to be in Hawaii!! XD About three weeks now, the wait is killing me. :P It's going to be uber awesome because I get to have Brian come with me. *dances* In other news there isn't much.. Although I was thinking about <i>maybe</i> getting a tragus piercing sometime soon. Mostly because when I went to get Jen's eyebrow pierced for her birthday she told me not to get anything pierced. So of course, after she said that, I was thinking of something that I could/wanted to get pierced. I'll end up doing it at some point, just not yet. Which reminds me.. I never did put up pictures of my tongue. Haha. Oh well. For my own enjoyment, I suppose. XD *shrug* Anyways, I also bought some uber cool kitty ears not long ago! =^.^= They're black/pink AND they light up! *wiggle* Here's some pictures (I'm still deciding which one to use for a userpic):

"event","So for my birthday the other day (12th) I got my tongue pierced. That (and the sword my boyfriend got me) is my favorite present. :D

So here's a run-down of how it's been...

Day 1 (piercing day!): Had a fairly good day before it, had a huge brownie at school in the morning. After school I came back home, opened a few presents, and had some of my cake. After that we (me, my boyfriend, and his friend because he had to drive us) went and got Jen. That was a fun ride adding her in, since Karlin's vehicle was meant to hold three people, slightly uncomfortably. We went to Red Robin's, I had water, ice, and some mozzarella sticks. After thoroughly brushing and flossing we went on to the piercing place (Body Piercing Unlimited). Yay us, the piercer was there! I signed some stuff, showed him my i.d., and Jen payed for it (*hugs her*). After cleaning everything really well (including his hands multiple times) and putting on gloves he told me he was ready for me. He explained how it went down, no surprises there. He was piercing me with a 12 gauge, because he wouldn't do it at 10. Didn't want to risk hitting veins, alright with me. So he had me rinse with some stuff that was sort of like Listerine, but better (and not as bad tasting). He dried off my tongue, and marked it. After that he put the clamp on my tongue (didn't hurt at all, I even forgot it was there, and don't even know when he took it off). He told me to breath in deep, and when I breathed out, he pushed the needle through. It was nothing. It went through quickly, and felt like nothing more than a pinch. As for taking out the needle and putting the jewelery, I just kinda felt it happening.. it was a bit uncomfortable, but not that bad. Right when I put my tongue back in my mouth, I already loved how it felt being there. After that we came home and I took some pain relievers. It got a bit swollen and sore, but not very bad. I didn't even talk very funny (s and t words a little).  When Jen's dad came to pick her up, he brought over the mouthwash she had used when healing her tongue ring. H2Ocean, good stuff. Throughout this time I drank cold water, felt good. 

Day 2 (yesterday): Woke up with it feeling better than I figured it would, considering that it's supposed to be worse in the morning (having your head not elevated for awhile, ya know?). Took my shower, did my tooth/cleaning routine, took some pain relievers, and went to school. I still wasn't really talking too funny! A little bit, but not very noticeable. My brother kept making fun of me saying ""Oh just wait, it's gonna happen."" :P I actually had to show people at school, they didn't notice me talking different. They attempted to make fun of me, having me say words that should be hard with a fresh tongue piercing, but I showed them. lol We even had a Seminar in class that day (when we discuss a paper as a class) and I didn't have trouble through that, either. Later on I started getting tired (slight lack of sleep plus no food for around 24 hours), and I got a really bad headache. That, and my cancer sore hurting, throat being a little bit swollen (from before, I had forgotten about it), and my tongue hurting a little more, and being a bit more swollen from the pain relievers wearing out put me in a really really bad mood. Not to mention Brian was eating Sushi in front of me and I LOVE sushi.. but couldn't eat it (AND he had like three different kinds of drinks I would have liked to try, I just didn't want to have to rinse out right after and have that unpleasant mouthwash taste in my mouth). After I took more pain relievers and had more food and water, everything felt a lot better again. We even walked down to video city to return a movie and get another (Strangeland, awesome!). Later that night we walked down to the gas station to get a little carton of ice cream, then we went back home and watched the movie. I ate the WHOLE darn thing! Felt good, haha. After that I did my cleaning thing and went to bed. No problem. Yay me! : )

Sooo.. I'll have more updates soon. :D"

My neck hurts.

and I'm tired of explaining it. So for now, at least, I will just copy/paste what I said to somebody in a myspace message. Grrarr.

Welll.. My boyfriend was coming up to a light on A and 5th, and didn't realize it was red because there was 2 or 3 other cars going through it. Pretty much he was just going with the traffic since one would assume that many people wouldn't run a red light. So this air force guy driving his friends car hits us on the left (we had been in the far left lane). I think we were going about 20 because he realized something was weird and slowed down, and the other guy said he might have been going 30 something. Fortunately for us the best safety feature on my boyfriends car was where we got hit. I was worried about him for a moment because the car hit on his side, and right where he was. The doors are good enough, though, that you couldn't even tell there was damage when sitting in the inside. The other car actually didn't have much damage to it, there was some on the front, but very drive-able. So, my boyfriend got a citation for running a red light, but I'm not sure for how much. I also don't know how much it will cost to fix his car, or if it can be. It looked like the axel on his wheel was messed up, and since it's connected to stuff the frame could be bent, in which case they would just total it (this is what my sister-in-law said *shrug*). Naturally now we are going to do something tonight to try and get our minds off of it, lol. ^^"

It ended up Crystal had straightened her hair not long before, so she had her really good straightener here. Soo, I used it. Woot. Anyways.. We went to the mall and I got a really awesomely and very bright little zip-up hoodie at.. the... hippy-ish store in 5th ave. mall. lol (I forget the name of it) Then we did some other stuff, and I ended up hanging out with my brother, sister-in-law, and some other people at my other brother's friends house (lol).

"event","Sooo.. I printed out pictures and started mine and Brian's photo album thingy. Yay. It looks pretty good so far. It made me realize that we need more pictures, though! Oh well, I suppose we usually get too caught up in what we're doing to think to take pictures of it. lol In any case, here is a survey because I can.


50 Girl Questions

What color is your bra?
*checks* black one today.

Hair, up or down?
It's down today like it usually is.

Do you straighten your hair?
No. On occasion I will, if I feel like it.

Do you worry about the size of your boobs?
Not so much anymore. I don't care all that much, except it's really annoying when my good bra is in the wash and/or a shirt makes them look funny. It's the smaller one's fault. :(

Whats your favorite girly magazine?
I don't read girly magazines.. or magazines at all, usually.

What your Favorite mascara?
I don't usually wear makeup, but when I do I never use mascara (my eyelashes are big enough already).

Small or large purse?
Medium, hehe.

In your purse, what are your must haves?
It depends on where I am.. but I'll give the very basic for regular use: Cell phone, tampons (for emergency purposes of either myself or others), wallet. Usually there's a lot more in there, though. lol

Jeans or skirts?
I don't wear jeans. Skirts are fun.

Do you wear clothes/shoes/jewelry that's uncomfortable?
No. Some of my clothing will become slightly uncomfortable after wearing them all day, but that's the worst it gets to.

Did you ever spend all day/night getting pretty for a guy?
ALL day/night? Literally? Hmmm.. I don't think ALL day, but I definitely throughout it (as in things here and there).

What is your favorite color?
Red.. black.. rainbow .. neon stuff. No, I can't give you one straight answer for that. If you asked somebody else they'd say red, but people know me a little better would say the above, lol.

Do you consider yourself girly?
*sigh* admittedly, yes.. I am a bit girly. I can deal with that now, though.. most of the time.

Heels or Flats?
Flats, please. Tall shoes can be okay, but I don't really like heels.. make my feet hurt.

Did you ever cry during a romantic movie
Nope.

Would you leave the house without makeup on?
Uhh.. every day. lol 

Wal-mart or Target?
*shrug* Target, I guess? We just got one here in Anchorage..

Do you consider making out ""unladylike""?
... wtf!? Haha, no. Maybe in certain situations, but at the right time/place, why the hell not? pfft.

On the scale of 1-10 how fun is shopping?
Depends. I don't usually like shopping.

Are you spoiled?
A little, lol.

Do you think lipgloss is the best?:
... no. o_O I never use lipgloss. I don't even remember the last time I tried to wear it for more than two seconds.

Do you freak out if you miss your favorite show?
No. I don't watch much tv anymore.

How long does it take you to get ready in the morning?
Shower and all, I think 40 minutes, give or take. 

Accessories make the outfit: true or false:
Hmm.. sometimes. Depends on the outfit. Some look good, or even better, without accessories. Others look weird without them, to me.

Do you like skater boys?
Nah. I'll stick with my dork, thanks. : )

Do you often wish there was something you could change?
Yeah, I suppose.

Gold or silver?
I don't really like gold. It's okay sometimes, though.

Do you dress up too much for holidays?
Not usually. Sometimes I dress up uber if there's a rave.

Do you like to wear dresses??
I don't remember, it's been so long. o_o

Do you write a lot of mushy love poems?
I write poems, but not a lot.. some of them are love poems but they're not usually ""mushy.""

On a scale of 1-10 how much do guys confuse you?
Meh, I dunno. Usually I'm pretty good, but sometimes I don't understand them at all. lol Of course, that's a pretty general question.. and I'm thinking a little more specific, I guess.. a little.

In the past 24 hours have you hung out with a guy?
*thinks* No. I hung out with my mom and sister-in-law most of today. Other than that I've been by myself or with animals. lol"

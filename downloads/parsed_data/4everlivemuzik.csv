"event","WOW..finally an update I know!!! Well, lot's have happened over the past month I have been away from this thing but for the most part I will leave it at that! Although, I do have to say that I am completely fed up with people (minus a slight few)!! GRRR! I can't even begin to explain why! I just am like starting to dislike like everyone and I'm starting just not even care. I kind of hate this though because I used to would never think this way and let things just roll over my shoulder but I'm tired of just sitting back and not saying how I feel and standing up! Now is the time! Sorry if that brought you down, but if you are reading this then you are prolly one of the few I don't have a problem with right now, minus a couple people with whom I won't mention but you know who you are. People just make me so freakin mad these days. Just with things they say and do! And I just want to say one thing to my friends and that is that I wish all the back-stabbing and talking behind each other's back thing and arguing over the stupidest things would stop. There isn't any use in doing this because all it will do is cause drama and you could lose friends and what not and I don't that to happen. We have enough stress and problems to deal with at home and with our school work to let something else get in the way. The time with our friends should be our escape from all these things. I love you all so please take time to consider this! Now onto less negativity...sorry about all that by the way! Life is GREAT!! (except that one main thing)I am the happiest I have been in really long time, if not ever! I love Justin! He has given and is still giving me all the things I have been needing for a really long time...he came in my life at a time when I felt like I had no one and things were going ALL WRONG. He has changed that though, and he has changed me! I could go on forever! He is the BEST! But I will stop here because I know how annoying hearing/reading this kind of stuff can be. I just thought it was time to fill you all in on a little something about what has been happening my life. Have a good day!!"

"event","HAPPY NEW YEAR!! I hope you all had a fun time watching the new year roll around! This past year has gone by so fast! Well let's see here what all I did today! I did the usual cleaning and then I got ready and went with my cousin Ashley to the mall and we were there for a good while. Before that though, we went and ate at Burger King and I saw Cody and Dustin like right by the parking lot so I called those goofy boys up and they came and ate their McDonald's with us while we had Burger King ...lol. Then later,after the mall, Ashley dropped me off at my parent's friend's house and I got to babysit while they partied and what not..woo hoo! I also got to be like a designated driver type person. I had to take my parents and some of their friends home! It's all good though! I wish I could have done something with some friends though! Oh well, I got to take funny shots of people on the video camera! lol...That's pretty much all! Only 2 more days of break!! AHH!! I don't want to go back to school! But we can't always have what we want. Well that's about all! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!"

"event","Ok, so let's see here. How has my two week break been? Well, actually it's been pretty boring for the most part. All I have done during the two weeks is like get up at 12:00, eat, clean, and then lay around being absolutely bored the rest of the day. My friends need to start calling me so we can hang out and I won't be bored. I never hang out with any of my friends!! It depresses me too. A lot of times I feel alone and like I have no one. This year has possibly been the worst year of my life! But that's a whole different story. 

On a much lighter note, I had a good Christmas! I hope you all did to. Here is a list of some of the things I received for all of you who would like to know.
14 CDs
Portable CD player
Cd case
new winter coat
3 pairs of shoes
a new cell
6 shirts
lot's of jewelry
and a bunch of other small stuff

Oh, yeah and to all of my friends, I was going to send you all Christmas Cards but I never had a way to get them mailed so I will prolly just give them to you when we get back to school so I am sorry for them being belated!

So what are you all going to do for New Years? Me, I will probably just be home sitting like always..lol!!

Oh yeah, I decided to get my hair done!! I was ready for something different because I have had the same hair style for about 2 years now. I liked it and all, but it was time for a change. I got layers, and some bangs, and red highlights!! Fun huh?!?! ...lol

Well that's all for now!! I hope you all have had a great holiday! Happy New Year and I will see you all on Monday!!"

"event","Well I have yet again decided to get a new journal. Only because I feel the need to write down all I'm feeling again and because of the fact that I have not updated the last one in about 4 months or so. So tell all of your friends to add me! Thanks!"

Day</a>, a 31-year-old man who was a product of Jerry Sandusky&#39;s &quot;Second Mile&quot; program. He has given up on looking to his superiors for guidance, pointing out the failures of leadership in all major facets of his life: in education, politics, church, etc. And he ends by saying, &quot;I can&rsquo;t wait for my parents&rsquo; generation&rsquo;s Joshua any longer. They&rsquo;ve lost my faith.&quot;<br /><br />The baby boomers, when they were younger, fought passionately for change. They were very politically involved and extremely hopeful. I&#39;m seeing what I imagine feels similar today in the Occupy Wall Street movement, and in some ways, it really does give me hope. I hope that this moment is the beginning of a new generation&#39;s legacy. I want this to be the moment where we get our priorities straight and commit to the kind of self-sacrifice and accountability that has been eroded over the last few decades.<br /><br />I want to ensure that the generations behind us looks to us as a generation of problem-solvers, leaders and people willing to sacrifice. I don&#39;t think we have a choice and I see a lot of reasons for hope and optimism.<br /><br />What I find horrifying in this whole Penn State fiasco are the thousands of students who protested Paterno&#39;s firing. I see people who don&#39;t seem to have the first idea of what accountability looks like. There is no argument that Joe Paterno did an enormous amount of great things in his life and helped many people. He wasn&#39;t fired for being a bad man; he was fired for not doing enough to stop child rape. He was fired because there needs to be accountability.<br /><br />Real leadership would have looked something like this: Paterno would have claimed responsibility for his inaction and offered to step down. That would have been leadership. Instead, he dodged responsibility and focused on college football at great expense to innocent children.<br /><br />I wanted to see the Penn State student body mobilize to focus on fixing the problems that led to the cover-up and put plans in place that would prevent this in the future.<br /><br />I hope this generation ends up to be more like the Wall Street occupiers and less like the Penn State protestors. I want us to get our priorities straight and learn to embrace sacrifice and responsibility with a sense of maturity and pride (not only in response to bad press). I hope we are able to teach the next generation what accountability looks like.<br />"

"event","Well it looks like Bonnie and I are on the move again, not very far this time though. We're moving about half an hour outside of Providence to the small coastal town that we both found jobs in. We love our current apartment. It's special. It's by far the most beautiful and spacious place we've ever lived in together. It's an entire floor of a renovated Victorian home, three bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen, gorgeous bathroom, chandeliers, walls painted warm colors, wood parquet floors, a fenced in double lot yard surrounded with trees and plants. It's amazing. BUT, we're an ansy kind of people. We like change. We like different experiences and its time for something new. 

This was sparked by a winter where finances caught up to us in the form of student loans and increased car payments. So in an effort to save money and satisfy our craving for something new and interesting, we decided to search for a place to live near where we work.

We found it. It's a cottage on the lot of a quite large Victorian home in a rather wealthy area of Tiverton, RI. The neighborhood is surrounded on two sides by water. We'll be living in a cottage that was renovated to be a dance studio, which has since moved onto main street. It has a loft-like feel with high ceilings and a lot of open space, with the cuteness and wood beauty of a nice cottage. We'll gain privacy, still have a lovely yard for Max and outdoor life, and will save money on rent, heat and car gas. It's a good deal. We're pretty happy about all of this.

We found another couple to take up our current apartment, so our landlord is kind enough to let us out of the lease. The new couple seems pretty awesome; I think they'll be a good fit here."

"event","We had an electrician working on the chandelier in our bedroom this morning, so while we were housebound, I put on the film ""Alice's Restaurant"". It's a movie based on the song by Arlo Guthrie, starring Arlo Guthrie. First of all, I've heard the song a many a times, but I always pictured him to be a middle-aged man singing. In the movie, he looks like he's around 20 years ago. He just has a really unusual voice. It was a fun film to watch, much less about the Vietnam War than I had expected based off of the song. It was funny in parts and then ended up getting more serious near the end as it had started out all ""happy hippy 60's"" and then showed some troubles that certain characters fell into over time. I'm surprised I've never watched it before. The electrician kept laughing out loud at it quite a bit and talked to us a little bit about how people just traveled all the time with no real destination, that's just how it was then.

"event","I recently watched two of German director Fritz Lang's films: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29"">Metropolis</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_%281931_film%29"">M</a>.

Metropolis is a silent film considered to be one of the first sci-fi films ever. One of Bonnie's former bosses had told her it was her favorite movie and Bonnie had to watch it (she had the movie poster hanging on her office wall). The film was pretty political given the fact that it was filmed in Germany during the Weimar Republic and dealt with socialism/class discrepancies. Some of the effects were were pretty awesome and I have no idea how they did some of it (see the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%BCfftan_process"">Shufftan Process</a>). One thing that is also pretty cool is that it was produced by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babelsberg_Studios"">Studio Babelsberg</a>, still a major German film studio. Recent films it is involved in are Inglorious Basterds, The International, Valkrie, The Bourne Ultimatum, V for Vendetta and so on. Pretty cool. It's logo is based off of the machine from Metropolis.
<lj-embed id=""27""/>


Metropolis is more famous and probably had a bigger impact on film and culture, but I personally like ""M"" much better. It was Fritz Lang's first ""talkie"" and is part film noir/thriller. It was pretty awesome. It was apparently not well received by the Nazi government (who saw themselves in the killers?) and Lang fled the country shortly after its release. His wife, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thea_von_Harbou"">Thea von Harbou</a>, who had produced the film with him, eventually ended up joining the Nazi Party a year before Hitler came into power. They had divorced by that time.

I can't find a trailer that has the english subtitles, but oh well.

"event","Can I just tell everyone how much I love Netflix? I'm reading the movie section of the New York Times and there's an article about a new Coen Brother's movie coming out that stars three of my favorite actors: Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin. Well, the first two are definitely among my favorite actors. I haven't seen Josh Brolin is much other than Goonies and W, but he did well in both. Anyways, the Coen brothers are remaking a John Wayne movie, True Grit, which I have heard about a lot but never watched.

Top of the Netflix queue. It bumped ""The Enforcer"" to number two; it's the third film in the Dirty Harry series. The rest of the series seems to be available on livestream, but I don't like watching things out of order so I need see The Enforcer really soon so that I can watch the rest.

The Coen film is not a remake of the John Wayne film (they said they only vaguely remember watching it as kids and didn't ""do their homework"". This came out of one of them reading the actual book out loud to one of their kids). It's another adaptation of the same book <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Grit_%28novel%29"" target=""_blank"">True Grit by Charles Portis</a>.

Looking forward to this one.

"event","I love moral ambiguity. I've really thought about this. First off, it's just a great phrase, feels good to say ya know? Secondly, it's a really engaging situation. I love it in art and I think it's really profound when situations arise (in real life or in art) where the morality of a situation isn't black and white.

For a Christian to kill a fellow soldier in war who is injured and in excruciating pain, do they ""kill"" or not? Do they break a commandment and take God's work into their own hands, or do they feel compassion and put an end to their friend's suffering?

In my own life (when I adhered to a more Christian-centered moral compass) I had to question which three options were the most ""wrong"": Pretend to love a guy (thus lying and being careless with another person's emotions), keep my feelings about girls to myself (which also involves lying and deprives others of knowing that they're loved) or be completely open about my feelings (not lying and letting people I love know about it, but breaking a ""supposed"" basic tenet of Christianity?) At one time in my life, this felt like a very morally ambiguous situation.

I'm watching an old film called ""M"" by Fritz Lang, which led me to read the Wikipedia entry about him. He's considered one of the directors to have helped form the film noir genre with its ""themes of psychological conflict, paranoia, fate and moral ambiguity."" Film swoon.

I've been going through a bunch of movies in my head looking for that morally ambiguous element and it's present in almost all of my favorite movies. It's actually something that is common in almost any decent story. My favorite example is the Godfather. Yes, Don Corleone is involved in so many of societies so-called ills like gambling, murder, bribery, sexism, etc. He is quite capitalist (in the film version at least) which includes many of its own moral issues. Yet, it isn't fair to say he is a downright immoral man. He's an independent spirit who has defined his own code of ethics, but he does live and die by it. He has an incredibly strong moral compass. He seeks justice for people who our own justice system fails. His so-called crimes aren't so different from the actions of our police departments. It's moral ambiguity at its best.

Back to my movie now."

"event","Ugh, there's so much I want to write about! But I don't have all day, so instead, I'll make a list.

Movies/Books that I've either started or are relevant to now that I really need to read/watch ASAP:

<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">A Single Man:</span> (I just watched the movie with Colin Firth a week ago from Netflix and now Bonnie picked up the book by Christopher Isherwood from the library).


<lj-embed id=""14""/>

<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">The Girl Who Played With Fire:</span> I need to finish the book because I need to see the movie which came out a few weeks ago and I missed.


<lj-embed id=""18""/>


<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">The Social Network:</span> Looking forward to seeing that with Bonnie and Jay, partly because I'm oddly fascinated with Mark Zuckerberg and partly because Jesse Eisenberg is really adorable. The trailers looks really cool.


<lj-embed id=""22""/>

<span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Let Me In:</span> I'm looking forward to going to see this film as well. Now, I saw the original Swedish film ""Let The Right One In"", which was fantastic. I was actually disappointed to hear that America needed to ""recreate"" an already great film simply because Americans don't do subtitles (or whatever the issue is). However, I did see some trailers that piqued my interest and the cast looks promising. The fact that they changed the title is a bad omen though because first of all, it's just lamer. Secondly, ""Let The Right One In"" is actually more relevant after you've seen the film. Thirdly, ""Let the Right One In"" is the title of a Smith's song that played at the beginning of the Swedish version and it just makes sense.

American Version:

Bonnie and I have this thing that started back in the days of new Harry Potter book releases/movie premieres where we'd re-read the books (or at least the book right before whatever new release was about to happen). Bonnie was suffering some pretty bad bouts of insomnia and reading out loud to her would help her fall asleep, so that's what we did. It started a reading out loud kick that never went away and the most recent book I read out loud was To Kill A Mockingbird.

Re-reading To Kill A Mockingbird outside of a school assignment was awesome, so great. I knew I liked reading it in school, but all I really remembered was Scout and her brother being really curious about their shut-in neighbor Boo Radley and something about a trial where her dad Atticus represented a black man in court. 

You wouldn't know it if you only watched the crappy movie version, but To Kill A Mockingbird first and foremost is a story told from Scout's perspective as an adult. She's telling the story of her own growing up and confronting her own childhood ignorance, largely based on Harper Lee's own childhood.

You watch these kids go from naive acceptance of the way things are (including themselves) where they make up scary assumptions about a shut-in they have never even seen to understanding and confronting their own ignorance.

And through all of the serious elements, one of the best parts of the whole book is the humor! It was so funny at times! There's a certain southern sense of humor that I really love, a way of telling a funny story that says so much in a simple way. 

After re-reading the book, we watched the movie from Netflix and holy cow does the world need a remake and that's all I have to say about that. It would need to focus way more on the kids perspectives and would definitely need to include a lot more of the funny elements. The book was funny, cute, serious, smart. The original movie wasn't funny or cute at all and only had fleeting moments of smart. It definitely had serious down though, blah."

"event","One of my favorite songs in my early teens was ""Tomorrow Wendy"" as sung my Johnette Napolitano on her live Concrete Blonde Album ""Still In Hollywood"". In the intro to the song, she talked about the song's meaning a bit and mentioned that it was about a woman with AIDS written by her friend Andy Prieboy of the band ""All of Voodoo"". 

I recently did a youtube search for the video and actually found two really interesting videos, one was a more recent live version of her singing it where she elaborated on the song's meaning. Basically, it's about a friend of Andy's named Wendy who contracted AIDS and instead of suffering the pain, isolation and intense stigma associated with the disease (at that time especially, people were afraid of knowing someone with AIDS), she chose to commit suicide. This really shifted my understanding of the song. It's so much more about taking control of the only thing left she had control over, when and where she was going to die. Ugh.

The second video was the original music video of Andy Prieboy singing it, which I didn't even know existed, and it's amazing. Johnette is also featured on it.:
<lj-embed id=""10""/>

Even growing up in the 80's, I was very young and had to make an effort on my own to try to grasp the magnitude of the impact AIDS had on everyone and how it changed so much about life.

For a while, my idea of AIDS was a montage of images and news-bites: Magic Johnson stating publicly that he was HIV , Pedro Zamora from the Real World cast educating people about the disease, the Ryan White Story made for tv movie. Fight AIDS Not People With AIDS. The AIDS quilt.

Yes, I knew about it. Yes I knew it was horrible. But it wasn't until I read the book ""And the Band Played On"" by Randy Shilts that I began to understand how devastating this disease was at that time. NOTE: I know it still is. And as an epidemic in many parts of the world. I'm specifically thinking about American lives around the 1970's through the early 90's when the questions and ignorance about the disease was at an all time high.

It was just so many layers of devastation. It was viewed as a death sentence (for most it was). It was an ugly and inhumane way to die. People were scared of people with AIDS. AIDS patients were actively shunned by society, by our government, and by our ""health system"". I know it's a huge book and a difficult subject matter, but ""And the Band Played On"" should be required reading for everyone at some point in their life. And if you don't read the book, then at least rent the movie from Netflix. I didn't understand how much crap people with AIDS had to experience even beyond the physical consequences of the disease itself. 

I wonder how much different our culture would be if AIDS hadn't happened. How would dating/relationships be different? How much more art would have been created by artists/actors/writers/etc who died of AIDS?

I just watched ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and looked up the adorable kid who played Dill, actor John Megna. Died of AIDS in 1995.

"event","Ugh, I love two things: The movie ""Whip It"" (nice music!) and Ellen Page. New life goal: I need to be a jammer on the Providence roller derby team. Seriously.

In other news, I feel REALLY old lately. OK, not REALLY old, more like oddly old. I feel youthful, healthy, like I have most of my life ahead of me yet and all of that good stuff...but little people that used to be toddlers and babies in my life are now returning from serving in Afghanistan or starting their first year of high school and I'm sorry, but that's just too weird. Make it stop.

Who cares though? I never want to be one of those people that dreads every year I get older. Getting older is kind of cool in many ways and all that age dreading stuff seems like old person baggage that is more about image then about anything real. But I am definitely feeling it lately, and it's quite odd. I wonder when I'm going to spot the first gray hair.

While I just turned 29, let's just round up for the sake of argument. There's a really good chance that I'm still 15 years away from even reaching the half-way mark of this life biz. That's pretty much incomprehensible to me. Clearly I need to join a roller derby team; that's really sucking the marrow out of this life. Yeah.

Or maybe I'm well past half-way. Not to be morbid or dark, but we all know that ""the big day"" could be any day and it really gives me peace of mind to say that I'm super happy right now. I have goals and dreams for sure (thankfully), but I could barely be happier then I am now. 

Cue unexpected life assessment with the Beatles' ""In My Life"" softly playing in the background:

At least I can say I found love, someone who I connect with more then I ever imagined was possible and someone that I trust as much as anyone can trust a person.

At least I figured out something that makes me happy in life, which is to say that I found something that keeps me on my toes and that I enjoy doing, and this came after learning that I do not need a ""career"" to disproportionately satisfy my sense of meaning in my life. I like my job. It's fun and keeps me interested and it doesn't feel like something that defines me too much, which is a really good thing. I do web design, but if you ever ask me what I am, I'll never say I'm a web designer. I hope you understand the difference and why I don't feel that's a bad thing. 

At least I already took crazy risks & chances & did things that were based on their potential rather than their guarantees. 

At least I made commitments. 

I've owned assets! Shut up, my grandparent's Buick is super spacious and my Saab has 227,000+ miles on it and that's a freakin' source of pride. I've lived in three cities and have only had one window smashed and two broken car stereos stolen. I've been lucky enough to never break a bone, but I'm experienced enough to have fractured an ankle and been knocked out more than I can count.

I've traveled a lot, but never enough. I've seen my family go through great accomplishments and I've seen them struggle through some great challenges with amazing strength. They're amazing. I'm so lucky.

I live in an apartment that is, at least to me, more beautiful than most houses. It's the kind of place that is so one-of-a-kind and perfect and I LOVE it. Love it love it love it. 

There's just so much I'm happy for and so much I'm glad I went through and so much I'm looking forward to. So. I'll stop being mushy now. You can skip to the next song if you'd like now."

Suffice it to say, the problem is resolved and now I can get on with life.

Today I have my external hard drive plugged into my laptop for the first leg of the ""get my life organized"" marathon that is about to happen. The first leg is comprised of the ""free up my laptop memory"" event, a gentle warm-up for the more strenuous activities to come. I'm not a marathon kind of gal, so this merits a participation ribbon at the very least. I expect Bonnie to hand me dixie cups full of <strike>wine</strike> water as I perform today's marathon.

Other events will include cleaning the house as detailed in a previous entry, maybe some mowing of the yard, maybe some finishing of my business card, and hopefully some blog posts on my secret money making scheme website.

"event","I had quite a scare of the techno-privacy variety yesterday. I was checking my email via my phone and it told me my user-name & password were incorrect. That never happens; it's my g-mail account and I didn't recently change it. I figured it was a strange phone quirk and I really didn't worry about it because I figured it'd be fine later when I actually got on my computer. 

Well that was not the case and then the real freak out began. Seriously, the amount of info someone can gain from just a few hours of email access is truly frightening. They can easily figure out my bank, then go to my banking site and say, ""Hey, I lost my password, send it to me."" This can be done for any site and its just scary. If someone breaks into my Facebook account and sends dirty messages to my friends & loved ones...I can deal with that. In fact, a part of me believes its only a matter of time. But if someone hacks into my email, that's personal! Email is sacred.

Thankfully, during my attempt at resetting my password while going through Google's security questions, it asked ""Do you have a blogger website and if so, what is it called?"" Then the light bulb in my head flashed and I remembered that blogger is owned by Google now and that I had just changed my blogger password the day before, which means that while I thought I was only changing my blogger password, I probably inadvertently changed my Google Accounts password. Yep. Sigh.

I don't like that I can't have a separate password for certain sites. It feels less secure. I don't really care all that much if someone gets into my blog accounts, but I really care if they get into my email. I know in theory that because its all the same account that's supposed to make all of these separate Google account entities more secure, but I don't understand it and that makes me feel less secure."

I'm at work on my lunch break at the moment. I've spent much of the morning reading about some of the inner workings of Wordpress software. Wordpress is amazing. It simultaneously manages to be really easy for non-developer folks to use and edit, and yet is quite complex and allows for a limitless amount of customization. It's brilliant. I've been trying to grok template tags, the template hierarchy, child themes and related issues and the result is that my right-brained mind is feeling quite pulled to the left today. While I still have very little ability to actually implement many of the more advanced features which require a decent amount of php programming, I definitely have a better overall picture and hopefully learned some things that may come in handy at some point. Baby steps are better then nothing.

I'm so anxious for the weekend to officially begin in a few hours! This week has been good but long and I have some projects that I am anxious to put some time into. One of those is a labor-intensive late-August pre-fall apartment organizing. Note I didn't write ""cleaning"". No, this is the more difficult project of actual organization. I've managed to raise my cleaning standards over the past few months and have found it easy to keep things clean, but organized is a different beast altogether.

Exciting plans include, but are not limited to: cleaning out two massive closets and the basement storage unit. This means actually calling the garbage pick-up folks to pick up things like a broken television and probably some other fun finds.It means cleaning up piles in the office, which means spending time filing papers, hanging up artwork, etc. Realistically, this will probably take way longer than I'm usually willing to give of my weekend, but aim high!

I also plan to write some more thrilling blog posts on my super secret money making blog. 

If I accomplish all of that, then I should probably finish tweaking my business card design and actually order them. I had already ordered some cards, but they came back wrong (my fault). Luckily, as a graduation present from RISD, every certificate program student who graduated this spring gets a free pack of business cards from the awesome Providence-based <a href=""http://us.moo.com/"">Moo</a>."

"event","I had a pretty peachy day at work. We have a project for an auto insurance web site that requires approx. 6-7 pages of various insurance related pages per state, so I've literally spent about the last four+ months of my work life creating content pages about ""Mississippi Mandatory Liability Laws"", ""Mississippi Auto Insurance Company Quote Comparison"", ""Maryland Car Insurance Rates"". I love to learn, even random knowledge is great knowledge, but I question whether its ever going to be useful for me to know which factors affect my auto insurance rate the most in the state of Rhode Island or whether or not we are a ""tort"" or ""no-fault"" state. Sigh. I know way more then anyone who has a car that is so cheap it isn't worth insuring should really have to know. Anyways, I basically finished it today. There's some more work that should be done to it, but the redundant content creating aspect of it is done.

We were supposed to take Kate out for dinner, technically as a thank you for dog-sitting Max when we were away for a week in Chicago, but really just because it's nice to meet up with her and we all love trying out awesome restaurants. However, Bonnie got a fierce migraine near the end of the work day, so dinner plans are to be rescheduled.

Bonnie is resting, so now I'm trying to decide what to do. Read Ragan Fox's blog? Work on my secret money-making scheme website? Read more of ""The Girl Who Played With Fire""? All of those sound great, but I really need to do something active. I can't stand sitting in front of a screen all day. It's unfortunate that the vast majority of things I enjoy happen to involve computer screens: Work, blogging, reading blogs, website development, Netflix Livestreaming, watching a few select television shows, writing/chatting with friends & family.

I'll go work out until I feel less antsy and then I'll probably have a clearer idea of what I feel like doing."

"event","Today I learned that a famous ship named <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour"">the HMS Endeavour</a>, which is what the famous spaceship Endeavour is named after, sunk in Narragansett Bay and it hasn't been precisely located! If only I had a metal detector

It's pretty cool how I came to know this. I was looking up Christa McAuliffe,the teacher who was chosen by NASA to take part in the ""Teacher in Space Project"" on the Challenger that exploded in 1986. I honestly don't remember what led me to look her up, but I did. So from there, I was talking to Bonnie about the woman who was chosen to be her backup, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Morgan"">Barbara Morgan</a>. I figured that the ""runner-up"" would feel quite relieved, partially guilty, and rather traumatized by the whole disaster. It turns out Barbara, who was a teacher, became an astronaut and went to space in 2007! That's just incredibly awesome.

So I was telling Bonnie about Barbara Morgan, and she casually informs me that her grade school was responsible for naming the Endeavor. What??? That little school in Hope Valley named the Endeavor!? To my never-ending amusement, she reminds me that she was in ""NASA Club"" as a fourth grader, which I only found out about a few months ago, despite the fact that I've been with her for 8+ years. She claims to have been ""the Mission Control Scientist or some sh*t"" that she took very seriously and she had to do some science experiment that involved coffee filters, ink and water. (The best part of finding out Bonnie was in NASA Club as a 4th grader was that they were told to sit in chairs that were laying flat on the ground to blast off. The vision of that is so cute it almost hurts.) Anyways...

Of course, I then need to look up the Endeavor to see if it mentions her middle school, and it turns out that her middle school did not name it after all. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour"">Space Shuttle Endeavor</a> was not named by Hope Valley Middle School. I quote:

""The national winners were Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Mississippi, in the elementary division and Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Georgia, in the upper school division. They were honored at several ceremonies in Washington, D.C., including a White House ceremony where then-President George H.W. Bush presented awards to each school.[6]""

So then, I see that it was named after the famous British Royal Navy research vessel and was about to call it a day with Wikipedia when I saw that it sank in Narragansett Bay! That's here in Rhode Island, about 15-20 minutes from me! 

I'm so on this. For Christmas, all I was is a metal detector & some scuba gear."

"event","I know it's sort of odd-sounding, but I've been doing two things lately that maybe I should be ashamed to admit but really, I'm already over it. And truly, only the first thing I'm about to say is somewhat stupid...the second part is actually kind of cool.

Part #1: Bonnie and I have taken to watching Big Brother Season 12. Now mind you, we don't have cable. We don't have satellite. We don't have a wide-screen digital television. And we certainly do not have a 3D television which seems to be a new craze. We have a rather small-screen plain old flat-screen which doesn't get any channels because we don't even have an antennae. My point is that we're actively seeking this out. It's true. Back in the day, we watched a season of Big Brother (whichever season it was the had Evil Dick)and were briefly obsessed with it. Well anyways, we've been craving some mindless television and had heard from Kate that this Big Brother season was pretty awesome, so we've been watching it online.

Part #2: In an attempt to find out a bit more about one of the contestants, Ragan, I discovered <a href=""http://ragan.wordpress.com"">his Wordpress blog</a>. He's been updating it since November of 2001! I LOVE IT. He's smart, funny and scandalous and it's a truly interesting blog to read. I've tried to start at the beginning.  I've only made it through a few months and its fascinating. First of all, it's great when there are references to things that were popular at that specific time. It's hard to believe that one of my favorite movies Amelie is so old now! That was almost a decade ago, unreal. He writes a lot of really interesting smart things about slam poetry, gender/gay issues, Bush politics, etc. It's actually been the impetus of several great conversations I've had with Bonnie. It's totally weird because I'm basically obsessing over a person's life from nearly a decade ago, reminiscing over stuff that doesn't really feel that old, learning some interesting things and all from someone that is currently on Big Brother. HOW BIZARRE.

No shame, really. I'm too old to care right?"

Over the past few days I've been reading a lot of other on-line journals and it got me wishing that I was updating more often. So I decided that while I'm feeling it, I may as well take advantage of the inspiration.

Quick life update of what's going on right now:

I'm living in Providence in a beautiful amazing Victorian apartment building; we have pretty much the whole second floor to ourselves. The fenced in backyard to this place is amazing as it lets Max run around to get his  energy out and has allowed us to try our hand at gardening. We've spent quite a few nights this spring & summer enjoying fires while hanging out with a variety of awesome folks. 

I'm working as a web designer at Zeus Design. I believe it's my first non-customer service job ever. Unless you count magazine internships, but since I never really got paid, at least not legally, that doesn't count.

I'm 29. I could stand to get my hearing, eyes and teeth checked but never seem to have jobs that offer insurance and I always find other things to prioritize.

And now I'm already bored with talking about myself. I feel that was a decent brief short & sweet ""hello"" and will now feel much better just launching back into this thing with random thoughts."

"event","It is a curious thing to experience, the realization that my family has fully transitioned into another phase of life. My parents are more GRANDparents than parents. My brothers and sister look like real adults. There are growing numbers of little people around and they ask me questions like, ""Are you my dad's sister?"" in a tone that implies their heads can't really stretch big enough to grasp that their dad is also a brother.

I've been thinking a lot about how much history my parents and my grandparents have that I've never heard. I never asked. I think about the fact that there is a very good chance, likely even, that I will never have children and I'm basically OK with that, except that I always wish I had someone to pass our stories and common history to. 

Every time I've been out to visit my parents, I've been purposefully asking them about their past and about their parents and grandparents. I want to know more than just the few stories I remember from when I was a kid (many of which I'm not even sure are true stories or if I imagined them...for example, I swear my dad told me I was related to Amelia Earhart, but he looks at me like I'm crazy when I bring that up now.)

My dad woke up early on Saturday to drive Bonnie and I to O'Hare airport to catch our flight back home to Providence. After our Dunkin' Donuts coffees were near finished and we were awake enough to start chatting, I asked him for more details on how he met the two Vietnamese boys that are now my adopted uncles.

Here's the story:

My dad was drafted into the army near the end of the Vietnam War and was stationed near Saigon. Identical twin Vietnamese boys, roughly around the age of 7, lived among the soldiers on the base. The story at the time was that they were orphaned, but whether they were deserted or were runaways is still unclear. In any case, they learned to speak English and hung out with the soldiers all the time. A family in New Jersey was supposed to be working on adopting them, but that fell through and the soldiers they had befriended  started to get reassigned. 

My dad, who had mentioned the boys on several occasions in letters to his parents, recorded a tape where he laid out the failed adoption attempt and before he even got to asking, my grandpa had turned to my grandma and said, ""Before this tape is over, he's going to ask us to adopt these boys and that's going to be a big decision that's going to require serious thought.""

Sure enough my dad asked if they would adopt the boys. My grandpa said he was prepared to think long and hard about it, but about five minutes after they had listened to the tape, he came to the conclusion that they had already had five children and they never had to stop and think long and hard before having any of them. So they made up their minds then and there that they were going to adopt these two Vietnamese boys.

Of course, it wasn't like there was a legal process to adopting Vietnamese street kids. It was always a matter of knowing who to contact and who to pay.

About a year and a half went by and my dad had either been assigned elsewhere or was already back in the states and they lost the whereabouts of the boys. My grandpa asked my dad about them and my dad told him to let it go. There was no way he'd be able to find them. They have no permanent address. None of them spoke Vietnamese. It would be difficult to get them here legally, etc. Grandpa Garrett said, ""Look, if those were my sons, I would never give up looking for them. I'm going over there and I'm going to find them.""

He brought along one of my dad's army friends, flew to Saigon, and knowing that the boys hung out at the zoo a lot, went straight there to start asking street kids if they knew where to find identical twin boys who knew how to speak English. It's unclear who did the talking; I assume the army friend knew enough to talk to people. Within six hours he had found them.

Understandably, the boys didn't trust that some Americans were there to adopt them, so one of them went to meet the visitors while one hung out around the corner in case it was a ruse. They recognized my dad's army buddy though and realized it wasn't a trick.

My grandpa went to the American embassy, which only granted visa's on a day-by-day basis. They denied my grandpa a visa to stay long enough to work out a way to get the boys to the US, which required a lot of phone calls to an Illinois representative (who I don't know). Luckily, my grandpa was the editor of a town newspaper <span style=""font-style:italic;"">The Mendon Dispatch-Times</span> and simply told the people at the embassy that he was staying until he had those boys on a plane to the US and if they threw him in jail, they could explain to the media why. (I'm sure he was rougher than that; my grandpa has a reputation for getting his way.)

He got his visas and worked it out so that they adopted the two boys. My dad suspects his unauthorized time away from work contributed to his losing his job shortly thereafter, but that's all I know about that.

I'm glad I asked."

"event","I need to write about Chicago's Don's Coffee Club.

In late 2001, my now girlfriend had just moved to Chicago from Greenwich Village, NYC. She had the luxury of living there when there were still a significant number of grungy coffeehouses and lots of hole-in-the-wall diners and assorted venues. She loved to discover the lesser known hidden gems of Manhattan. 

So she brought that same energy with her to Chicago and scanned the neighborhoods for new places to stake out.

She discovered Don's tucked away in a small dingy building in the Roger's Park neighborhood. The neighborhood was borderline safe, the kind of safe that exists in a neighborhood that is bleak, blighted and it hasn't made up its mind whether it is enjoying its last hurrays before it is completely forgotten and neglected, or if it was just pre-gentrified. It could have gone either way. There were artists tucked inside some studios and some business life, but you didn't walk around alone and you avoided eye contact with just about everyone.

She went there by herself the first time she tried it out. We were experiencing one of our Cold Wars, so I was not in the picture that time. A little while later though, when her and I were in a better place, she brought me there to meet her first Chicago friends, a motley-looking crew who invited her to join in their game of cards and smoke cigarettes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

This became the epicenter of our social life, as this group was somehow ALWAYS sitting on a small raised platform in the front window of Don's like some sort of real-person window display. Smoking, playing cards, and talking about everything.

We never called to meet up there; we just showed up knowing that they'd always be there. Don wasn't even the owner by the time we came on the scene; it had been sold twice since then. But it was still the same old smoky tiny place that you think must only exist in old movies, with jazz music playing and maybe five other ""customers"" at any given time. 

I have no idea how it stayed in business as long as it did because one of the best parts about it was that there were so few others. It was always our place and it was awesome. The owner at the time, Bob, wouldn't even ask us to pay for our drip coffee that he refilled while we hung out for hours. It was as though that was his offering to us for making the place appear to be a functioning business. I remember that we all had to keep track of how much we drank and owed, because it wasn't like Bob was ever going to actually ASK us to pay.

Around the same time, Bonnie also happened upon a truly disgusting diner a block away from her studio called Standees. Its sign consisted of a huge red arrow surrounded by flashing light bulbs pointing to the door. There was a small Formica-covered bar, maybe 8 orange booths, and a kick ass jukebox. 

$5 bought fifteen songs and we'd stay there with a few of our other young regulars until our net worth was under $2. There was a guy named Dennis who was ALWAYS sitting at the counter near the tv. He never really spoke, but once we came in often enough to qualify as regulars, he'd do that head nod thing. And then there was the waitress Julie, who was basically Tammy Faye Baker with a smoker's voice, a bitchy attitude and a police officer for a husband who ticketed any one parked for too long in front of Standees. For better or worse, it was another home away from home (which says a lot about the state of my living situations in Chicago). 

One day, Bonnie was sitting there when one of the workers was chatting with her about life in general and asking her how she was enjoying Chicago. It was an older guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt and he asked, ""Have you ever been to Don's?"" To which she replied that she had and in fact she went there all the time.

""I'm Don!""

""What?""

""I'm Don! That was my place!""

And so, Bonnie met the famed Don of Don's Coffee Club during his brief stint working in one of north Chicago's scrappiest diners. For anyone familiar with these two joints, you understand how absurd this is. As described by Rob in the film version of High Fidelity, both places ""attracted the bare minimum"" of customers. Lets just say that they were both places that are not easy to come by (and I still can't really figure out why Don was ever working at Standees in the first place.)

Don seems to be a bit of a legend amongst a quiet cadre of writers. I was reading ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by Audrey Niffenegger and all of a sudden her two main characters are meeting over coffee at Don's Coffee Club and Don, complete with Hawaiian shirt, makes a guest appearance. She described him quite accurately, but nothing compares a short piece that I read on McSweeneys: (scroll down to the headline ""A Don For All Seasons"".)<a href=""http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2000/07/26don.html"">A Don For All Seasons</a>

Standees bought an espresso machine, which I think was what made Don quit. He grimaced at it every time he looked at it. It was just ""too much!""

[correction: I originally wrote ""Almost Famous"" instead of ""High Fidelity"". A kind commenter corrected my error. I am grateful.]"

"event","I went to a baby shower on Sunday. Baby showers have a way of making me feel REALLY queer, in two senses of the word. There is the awkwardness of trying to converse with strangers when the only thing you know about them is that they happen to know someone that you know. ""Sooooo, how do you know so-and-so? Oh that's great! We work together."" I don't really care how they know aforementioned so-and-so, and I also know that they don't care how I know aforementioned so-and-so. But it's just how those things go. 

They also make me feel uber-homosexual, and not because there are tons of women there. It's because there are tons of straight women there. There is a sort of assumed female bonding ""girls only"" sort of thing that happens. The talk usually revolves around babies, the differences between men and women and related topics. I always get the weird feeling that I am like a guy that is eavesdropping on the bonding rituals of the other half and its not my world and I'm not supposed to be there. 

I don't really do dresses, or shopping, or boys, or babies. I'm not judging! I'm just sayin', my life is largely void of such topics. I always feel completely out of my element and I feel like a poser. It's so weird. Other situations that make me feel similarly queer: Bridal showers, mall shopping (particularly anything that involves dressing rooms), and wedding receptions. 

Speaking of feeling like a straight poser, is it cheating to go along with people when they talk about thinking some male movie star is hot? I was recently talking about the movie Chocolat and a female acquaintance said, ""Oooh, and Johnny Depp was so hot in that!"" And I was like, ""Oooh yeah."" But then I realized that this woman probably doesn't know I'm a homo and doesn't understand that I actually mean, ""Ooooh yeah, he is totally hot...but I wouldn't actually want to sleep with him."" Is this dishonest? I know what I mean, but I also know that it probably reads completely differently and maybe I have some sort of obligation to make myself more clear? I don't know; I've just been thinking about it and I decided that if I feel like a guy is hot, I'm still going to say it, even if it makes me sound way straighter than I actually am.

Mmm, I'm so enjoying having a lighter schedule now that school is over (minus my one project that is still due). I actually finished a book! I read ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao"" and I highly, highly recommend it. It's about a painfully nerdy/geeky boy(Oscar) born in the Dominican Republic who is the exact opposite of what a ""typical"" Dominican man should be. He's not macho. He sucks at sports. He speaks Elvish. He's an unhappy, overweight virgin. Then he moves to New Jersey...and nothing gets better. It's basically a character study (and not just of him, but several members of his family as well). If you can handle using context clues to figure out the heavy dose of Spanish words and phrases thrown in (never mind if you are already down with the Spanish) and if you don't mind an occasional interesting footnote, then I think you'd like it. I wouldn't understand you if you didn't.

I'm also half way through Twilight by Stephenie Meyer and enjoying it. The writing isn't the best, but I like the characters a lot and its pretty funny, so it's still a good read."

"event","I've been thinking a lot about my values and the choices I make on a day to day basis. Maybe it is simply that I've left the urban lifestyle behind after six years and now live in simpler parts, but it seems to me that the general population is much more aware and concerned with the environment than even a year or two ago. Energy conservation seems more mainstream again. I'm sure that the price of oil is a huge part of the awakening consciousness. I've seen a lot less SUV's out on the roads. There are still quite a few trucks, but I understand that a lot of people need those for the type of work that they do. But who really needs an SUV? I have a neighbor who has five SUVs. FIVE. I find it hard not to judge him fiercely.

Besides, I'm no green angel. I take long hot showers. I turn the heat up higher than I need it. I honestly would probably be too lazy to recycle as much as I do if I didn't have a thoughtful girlfriend who calls me out whenever I choose convenience over principles.

But I am improving and I'm definitely thinking about it a lot more. There are really easy small things I've been doing. I have lit a fire instead of turned on the light and heat (although, the smoke that it produces makes me question the value in this tactic. Anyone know which is generally better?) I use cloth napkins. Bonnie bought these good reusable cleaning rags that I've used a lot more for cleaning. We carpool when we can. We use the more gas efficient car (even though the sterio is broken!). We try to buy organic and local, etc, etc.

Working at a book store, I have the awesome power of book display and have wielded that power for the greater good. All of last month, the first thing friendly (and a few unfriendly) patrons saw when they entered the store was a lovely display of environmental books. A few were moved to buy. Who knows if they'll utilize some of the ideas in the books, but a seed was probably planted so to speak. One cool thing happened last week when a regular family came in and the dad asked me where the kids version of the Inconvenient Truth book was moved to because he saw it on the display earlier and wanted his kids to read it. Score.

I can't remember how I came upon this family (I think it was in a newspaper I was reading), but they are a relatively young couple with a 5-year-old and a 6-month-old and they are donating the vast majority of their possessions and making a life changing move to live sustainably. They are chronicling their experiences and experiments on a blog, Cage Free Family. They are at that very scary pivotal period right now where they are making final arrangements before they go for it. Apparently, there have been a fair amount of ridiculous negative comments directed at them from stupid people. Why would anyone have a problem with someone at least attempting to live their life in a better way? No one is perfect, but thank god some people do what they can to make good choices. They need support (and they are also needing to barter some stuff, so if you have something you think they could use, leave them a note).

I'm glad whenever I find people that are actively embracing a move to the simpler way of life. Sometimes I feel like I'm weird for not having aspirations for a bigger house or better cars, like it seems like I either don't expect good things for myself or I'm too simple-minded to know that there is better out there. But I'm actually just happier living relatively simple. I remember when I moved into my first studio apartment, I was so happy to live in a space where everything I needed was within 15ft, no more of that annoying having to run upstairs to get something I forgot or search several different rooms to find something I lost. Life was just easier. It didn't mean I became more simple-minded, I was just less distracted by stupid stuff. And I have never understood the concept of working to gain more money. I work to sustain my lifestyle. I'd eventually like to earn enough that I will be able to afford health care for myself and/or Bonnie when the need arises. I'd like to be able to contribute my fair share in taking care of my parents when they are too old to do it for themselves. That's why I work. I don't work solely to buy more and more and more stuff.

I have lots of memories of moments growing up where I felt confused or disappointed when I didn't see what all the fuss was about when other people acted like something was such a big deal. Weird examples: I vividly remember Michael Jackson being a household name, someone as popular as the pope or the president. I was at a neighbor's house setting up Nintendo when a video of Michael Jackson's came on the tv and she told me that was Michael Jackson. I honestly didn't believe her, because, well, he was just a dude. He sang and danced really cool and all, but still, he was an entertainer like thousands of others. I didn't get why he was such a big deal. I felt that way when I really understood that to be a model meant you get to be one of those people that pose for advertisements in magazines. I mean, really? Why do we care? (Before I get hate mail, I should admit that I understand the underappreciated art that goes into fashion and fashion photography and a lot of work that models do.) I just don't see why it is on such a pedestal and why anyone would spend so much of their lives trying to be one. For some reason, I expected a model to be way cooler, like being Miss America (which, actually, was another disappointment). I can feel myself being vague and weird right now, but I'm not sure how to fix that. So...moving on.

The point is that I'm getting more and more aware of and comfortable with my real values. And I understand that a lot of people feel alone or weird for not being too materialistic or for not being a workaholic or whatever. But that's just silly."

"event","Random Thoughts this Monday, May 19, 2008:

-We made sausage and eggs for breakfast, which means that Franco is pretending to be my pet friend and act like he's snuggling up to me for my attention, when in reality he is sneaking up to the uneaten sausage on my plate.

-My sanity is expected to improve this week, since it is the last week of classes. I'm finishing up some final projects (two of which are not due until a week or two after the last classes this week), and then I'll have many more hours to myself until June 17. Then begins my summer class: Photoshop! I feel like I have a relatively good grasp of photoshop in the sense that I can make photos web safe; I can crop and resize and all of that, but I'm not so good at the fancy work. I'm mediocre at using the tools and special effects. So this will be a good class for me to take this summer. It's two days a week, two hours each class and it costs lots of money. My first choice for my summer class was Javascript, but I signed up too late and now I'm first on the wait list, so I'm taking Photoshop instead. Such is life.

-Did you know that cat whiskers shed just like regular cat hair? I didn't know that. I learned that this morning when I awoke to find Elliot smashed up against the back of my head. He managed to take advantage of my lack of consciousness by taking over my pillow and letting me sleep at a really weird angle that has left my neck feeling a little ""blah"" right now. When I reclaimed my pillow, there was a huge cat whisker on it. It actually scared me for a second because I thought he was probably in pain, but then he jumped back on the dresser and started using his paw to knock over the lamp. He's fine.

-My sister sent me an email with a photo of her pregnant belly. It is very weird and awesome that my twin is pregnant. I can't wait until October. Her and her husband are moving into a new house over the next two weeks. I'm mildly sad and happy about this. I'm sad because their current (or former?) house is comfy and I have good memories there. But they are really excited about the new house, so I am happy for them. They were having some issues with their neighbors too, so it will be nice to move away from that creepiness.

-Bonnie and I are only four episodes away from being caught up on Lost. This is such an amazing show; I can't believe it has taken me this long to give it a try. Thank you Joe Roch for threatening the end of our friendships unless we started to watch it. Real friends don't let friends miss Lost."

"event","When we decided to pack up the kids and head east to the scary-sounding hamlet of Hope Valley, RI, I expected to have to make a few internal adjustments.

I'd have to get used to the quiet.
I'd have to accept the fact that the majority of people wouldn't be my kind of people and deal with it.
I'd have to contain my road rage.
I'd probably be bored at least once a week.
I'd miss culture and have to make a pointed effort not to become too easily pleased with crappy television and mainstream movies.
I'd have to avoid family restaurants and frozen dinners.

Well. I was only about 50% right. Compared to New York City, it's quiet. But only in the sense that there aren't sirens so often that I don't notice them and there isn't Dominican music shaking the foundations of my building at 3am on a Monday night. However, there are A LOT of sounds and 80% of them come from the variety of wildlife in the area. There are birds. Cranky-sounding birds. Birds that sounds like they're dying. Birds that sound like they're in love. Birds that sound like they're easily amused by the repeated sound of their own chirps. There are squirrels. Lots of squirrels. They run around on the roof and its loud. They also manage to attract the attentions of our three cats, who in turn meow and dart from window to window knocking over any salt shaker or wine glasses in their path. There are peep frogs. Owls. 

And then there are the man-made sounds: a town fire alarm that is tested at 7pm every evening, a church bell that chimes on the hour and plays Christian tunes for several minutes around noon on Sundays, school bells ringing, kids on recess, high-pitched creaking of playground swings, chainsaws from the neighbors who are clearing land to build a new house.

I don't have to get used to silence. It doesn't exist here. The major difference between here and the cities I have lived in for the past six years is that most of the sounds are a pleasure. Generally, I find myself trying to listen more than I try to block out.

So I thought I probably wouldn't dig most of the people out here. The truth is, I don't really dig most of the people anywhere. I'm not a huge social butterfly. I like my fantastic few and love them like family. I don't even need to hang out that often. I just need to know they're there when I need them. They're the kind of people I could probably not talk to for an entire year and I know that if I randomly called them up or wanted to hang out, they wouldn't be weirded out. And those people are available to me here as much as they are to me anywhere else. I don't get to see all of them as easily or as often as I used to, but really, that doesn't matter to me that much because my best friendships aren't the kind that would falter at the whim of distance or frequency. I've met a lot of truly awesome people out here too. Great people exist everywhere. In my life, the only place that proved that theory wrong has been Springfield, Illinois. While I didn't meet anyone awesome while I was there, I did sublease an apartment in NY from a guy who grew up there, and he was awesome. And my parents and oldest brother lived there for a few years too, and they're sort of awesome. Anyway, I work with some cool people. Some of our customers kick ass. I even like my elderly neighbors because they always say hello and how are you and they still give us a lot of privacy. I appreciate that.

As for the road rage, Rhode Island drivers are terrible and most of the roads here are single lanes. So generally, I've accustomed myself to leaving early enough to get wherever I'm going assuming that I'll be stuck behind a grandma going 20mph downhill. The main problem out here isn't that people are selfish or aggressive. It's that they simply don't pay attention. They swerve into oncoming traffic on an hourly basis. Most of the highway has rumble strips on the sides. They are way too trusting and way too distracted. And for some reason, everyone in Rhode Island freaks out on this one turn on the highway called the ""Thurber's Avenue curve"". It's true that it is a long turn and you can't see what is far ahead of you, but it really isn't even as intense as a common off-ramp. And why it causes so many accidents is beyond me because this state has some of the most windy roads I've ever experienced in my life. This turn is nothing in comparison. Rhode Islanders are still very much a mystery to me. But the road rage, generally speaking, is much better than in my Chicago days.

I'm not bored out here. Not at all. I wish I was. But I'm working full time, taking three classes, doing some freelance writing, and trying to do some housework and enjoy some free time as well. My problem is that there aren't enough hours in the day.

I haven't taken in much culture yet, but that's due to time constraints more than anything. In New York it was usually a money issue. Here, it's just a time issue. I've been reading the same book for about two months now. I've seen one movie all month (Stop Loss, very good). There hasn't been any theater, but I've never been a huge theater kid. I do have tickets to see Eddie Izzard on Monday...can't wait.

I have mainly avoided frozen foods (except pizzas, but that's nothing new). I have gone to restaurants like T.G.I. Friday's and Applebee's a bit more than I'd care to admit. The good news is that I've also gone to some really incredible places in our area and in Providence. It isn't that there isn't good food around. I've just been making lame choices and that can be changed.

My whole point with this blog is to say, I like it here a lot. Yesterday, I did yard work. I rowed a canoe in our pond. I went out for Chinese food. Today, I went to work and did homework. Tomorrow, I'll do homework and go to school. I'll then go watch an advanced screening for a movie I have to review by Friday. Now, I'm drinking some wine and I'm about to go to bed to read for a while. 

This whole ""moving to the boondocks"" thing: It's a good gig. It's more than just knowing it's the right thing for right now. I'm actually feeling good at the same time. Score."

I don't think I've even stopped to pull up a sock in three days. My life has been a constant go go go. Now the great thing is, I truly enjoy just about every part of my life at the moment. So it isn't like I'm miserable. I just wish I could stop time, sleep as long as I need, and then start time right where I left off so that I can feel rested instead of wired. I'd also like to read more, work on my Flash skills more, and clean my house more.

Last evening, I sat out in a rocking chair on our deck drinking wine, eating a stuffed pepper, and listening to peep frogs. I love old people activities. I'm just ahead of my time, that's all."

"event","I'm pretty ridiculously happy with the way things in life are going these days. I'm living in a place I never would have anticipated, but I suppose that's part of its appeal to me. Every day I wake up and think, ""Wow, it's so weird that I'm here. Cool.""

I love New England. I've only lived here during the drabbest, coldest months of the year and I swear I've experienced more sun than I did in Chicago or New York. Grey, cloudy and damp: I still think its ridiculously beautiful. The country out here isn't like the country out in Illinois where I'm from. The farms are small and very much a part of the community. I don't see acre after endless acre of nothing but corn and cows. There are just small plots of land, bordered by trees and stonehenges, with neighbors all around. There are lots of roadside fruit stands. 

Rhode Island is chock full of really random and weird stuff that just comes out of nowhere too. I've been meaning to document them as I witness, but I don't have a healthy relationship with my camera at the moment. 

Now spring is moving in and I'm welcomed to my next surprise. Jack and Rob, the dudes who lived in this house prior, had apparently planted tons of perennials around the house. They are popping up like mad. We've been working on the inside for months: knocking out walls, painting, tiling, adding trim and wainscoting, replacing windows and doors, etc. Now I'm ready to give it a rest on the interior and start work outside. I feel like I haven't had enough since I moved to Chicago in 2001.

I like my job. It's simple. I work at an independent bookstore in a converted house. It used to belong to some prominent townsfolk who owned a ton of land, and they donated most of their property to the city of Westerly. So now, I get to work in a place located right across from a beautiful park. Shakespeare in the Park is about to start, so that should be fun. The people I work with are pretty cool too; they're sufficiently sarcastic and weird for me.

I'm taking classes at the Rhode Island School of Design (nick-named ""rissdy""). I'm learning how to make pretty web pages for pretty people. Or ugly people. Whatever. While I definitely wouldn't mind getting a nice job/business going where I make professional web pages for businesses, I have to admit that I'm also highly turned on by the creative, artsy side of things and I like to play with Flash for my own amusement. I have great visions of totally useless art. Ask me sometime about my clogging army. It's going to be amazing.

Anyway.

Oh, I'm also freelancing for the Newport Mercury. I recently wrote an essay about how I bestow bad luck on any team I decide to root for. My main job for them is to be a film reviewer though. 

So most of my life is work, school, freelancing, and renovations. However, in those few hours that I reclaim by skipping class and not sleeping enough, I am catching up on ""Lost"". I am on the fifth episode of season three and I really think Hurley needs someone to love who doesn't get killed. I also don't know what the fuck is up with those scary extras that just showed up without no introduction.

I've been reading a lot too, but I haven't actually finished any books because I've been utilizing the library system and I can't ever finish a book before I have to return it. Someday, I'll finish the ""Time Traveler's Wife"" because it's awesome. I'm currently working on ""The Ground Beneath Her Feet"" by Salman Rushdie. It's amazing me.

What else what else what else? We threw a house warming party that had most of our close friends from the New York and New England area attend. It was perfect. I love my people.

I've been missing a few friends that I haven't seen for too long from Chicagoland. I'm hoping that once finances sort themselves out, I'll be able to make a trip to O'hare soon. 

Bonnie just launched a new blog called http://listofnow.wordpress.com. Check it out.

"event","Oh how I love the smell of cooking in my house. I am sitting on a Darcy-sized super comfy brown armchair with ottoman, a glass of red wine to my left, in view of our kitchen where Bonnie is cooking steak on a cast iron skillet with corn on the cob boiling on the adjacent burner. Oh, there are also baked beans in the works. There are three cats running around. I have a generic Target version of a Breathe Right on. It's pretty sexy. I am wearing an awesome new orange sweater mailed to me as a surprise from my favorite store, Denise's Closet (that's my sister in case you didn't catch that one).

I have applied for a few jobs. I have registered for three web development classes at the Rhode Island School of Design. I am on my way to a new career, I hope. 

I am getting over the embarrassing emotion of feeling mildly shocked and saddened at the death of Heath Ledger. 

I am enjoying imaging a female or black president of the United States. If I had to bet my life's savings (OK, that's not fair since I don't have any), I'd bet that it will be a Clinton/McCain showdown with Clinton prevailing. But it's still quite a wild guess probably influenced by a lot of wishful thinking. I am leaning towards Hillary over Obama, partly because I really want to see a female president, partly because I want a male first lady, and because I just relate to her a bit more. But honestly, I'd be happy with either. I don't like Edwards much. And McCain is the best of the worst, which is kind of good because he's the worst we might get stuck with, but he's also the hardest for a democrat to beat, in my humble opinion.

I'm reading a few relatively crappy books that I secretly enjoy (just finished ""Faith of my Fathers"" by John McCain and some other writer, and now I'm working on ""The Lost Painting"" by Jonathan Harr). I just finished reading ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" by Michael Chabon out loud to Bonnie. I'm glad I read it out loud to her, because I'm not sure I would have followed it easily without her. It's an excellent read though, once you get into it. New self revelation: I really like the word ""verbover"". 

I had a vivid dream last night that I think is the result of unconscious anxiety about going back to school an leaving the urban lifestyle so suddenly.

I'm going to eat now."

Instead of using central heating, Bonnie's dad installed individual wall mounted heaters in every room, each controlled by its own thermostat. It is allowing us to only worry about heating the rooms that we are using at any given moment and not have to pay to heat a whole house. Fantastic."

We went to Bonnie's grandma's house for a little New Year's Day breakfast. Her cousin Rachel made me blueberry Mickey Mouse waffles, which was pretty awesome. Back in the day, Mickey Mouse waffles were simply made of one large waffle for a head and two small waffles for ears. But this morning, I was served a one-piece waffle, complete with concave mouth, nose, and eyes. I think I would have enjoyed a Mickey Mouse waffle-maker as a child. I'm sort of sad that didn't exist back then.

I'll really be impressed when someone can come up a with one-piece Mickey Mouse pancake, complete with mouth, nose and eyes."

"event","Ahh, another wonderful morning to wake up to in Rhode Island. Last night, Bonnie and I stopped by the local Stop 'n Shop, which is admittedly dated and mildly depressing with its 1970's architecture and fluorescent lighting. I expected to find some cheap little meals like frozen pizzas that we could buy just to get us through this week since all of our cooking supplies are buried together in cardboard boxes. There was actually a lot of organic and natural food there. Who knew?

I am currently drinking Bustelo coffee, a latino brand in a fantastic yellow tin that I became accustomed to while living next door to a bodega in NY. I thought it was probably a rather rare coffee in the states, kind of a latino version of Folger's, that I'd only be able to find in a bodega in the middle of a Dominican neighborhood in NYC. I was quite delighted to find it on the bottom shelf of Stop 'n Shop in Hope Valley, RI. Again, who knew?

*finish painting kitchen cabinets
*start painting kitchen walls
*put clothes away
*unload some kitchen goods
*welcome in the New Year with a glass of wine

"event","Wow, my life has moved non-stop for a while now. I'm overall very very happy about the state of things, although there is a strong feeling that nothing seems real or permanent.

Bonnie and I are now officially in our new home in Rhode Island. I woke up this morning after spending my first night in our new bedroom on our own bed (we've been sleeping on couches in the living room up until now). There were three cats sleeping with me, which was quite delightful since two of them, the boys, have spent about two days hiding and shivering in random dark corners of closets and cabinets. They are suffering from sensory overload, which surprisingly started before we even left the NY apartment. After most of the furniture was moved out to the UHaul, we let them out of the bathroom and they freaked out because everything was so different. Elliott even tried to climb up the blinds, successfully pulling them down. So the fact that they were joining me on my bed was proof that they are starting to get used to this crazy new place. Now I can't walk without nearly stepping on Elliott because he's following me everywhere I go.

Our bedroom is a light blue green, near robin's egg blue. When we first painted it a few weeks ago on one of our weekend trips out here, we were really worried that it was much brighter than we had anticipated. I was feeling guilty because I talked Bonnie into it; she had wanted a slight greener color that was lighter. Neither one of us wanted the room to be too intense. Anyhow, now that our stuff is in it and we have natural light coming in instead of flood lights for painting, it looks fine. It's just how I pictured it and I love it. So does Bonnie.

It's small, with two windows that open up onto the side of our house and the backyard. When I'm on the bed, all I can see out of both windows are the tops of trees and the sky. The color of our room matches the outside very well, almost like the windows are picture frames...a nice way to start a day.

Bonnie was gone, attending her paternal grandfather's funeral. It was my first time alone in my new house, and what would I find but no coffee! The coffee pot could be in any of the dozens of boxes. Sigh, so I took a shower (not bad for well water, the pressure is a bit less but the temperature was fine), got dressed, and decided I'd take advantage of my legs and walk to a little bakery that we ate at yesterday. They only accept cash or check and since I had neither, I decided I'd walk all the way to the town's library in hopes that I'd come across an ATM on the way. I did pass one place that said it had an ATM, but I was mistakenly under the impression that it was a bar and I've heard that the townies can be a little scary so I passed it up. By the time I got to the library it was closing, so I turned around and decided I'd suck it up and go into the bar. It was a convenience store. Haha, oops.

So I got my coffee and started to walk back, when all of a sudden a minivan pulls up behind me and someone in the passenger seat calls out to me. I turned around and it was Bonnie's parents, laughing at me. So I smiled and asked if I could hitch a ride and they laughed and drove me up to their house. Bonnie and Dan arrived at our house right as I was walking in the door.

So that has been my morning, but there is so much more that has happened over the holidays and that is going on right now. But for the sake of ending a blog entry before it morfs into a blog novella, I shall say tata for now."

"event","Since my sleep schedule is so backwords by most people standards, meaning that I am more awake at night and sleep during most of the day, I decided that it would be a wonderful experience for me to walk around downtown during the early hours of dawn. I took that A train down to 4th St. and transfered to the B, which I thought would take me to Delancey Street. Even after over two years here, I still can't figure out how to get around. I knew I made an error when the train started to go above ground. I found myself on a train crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, which turned out to be a beautiful sight as the sun was just rising. At the first stop in Brooklyn, I got off and took the next train headed back to Manhattan.

I just walked around for over an hour, north through Chinatown and the Lower East Side, into the East Village and then I headed west through the West Village until I ended up at 14th St. and 8th Ave to take the A line back north to meet Bonnie for breakfast at the diner on Dykeman. The walk and the air and the beautiful day just put me in a great place. I feel really good right now. I feel very lucky to be able to watch New York City wake up on a chilly bright December morning. This is the kind of stuff the city is all about; a nice private little ceremony to sort of say farewell for now."

"event","I am in such a strangely weird fantastic place...both literally and figuratively. Bonnie and I are in Rhode Island painting a few rooms in our soon to be new home. We're also taking the time to really walk through each room and the yard and visualize what we want to do with the place.

I feel alive in a way that I haven't in a very long time. I miss having nature affect me so much. This place is awaking my senses with so many unexpected moments. I feel that same newness that the big city used to give me all the time. It's true; I learned to take so much of it for granted, but it got hard not to. It's certainly time to step back from New York, learn to appreciate this new environment in my life, and then really feel the buzz and the beauty on my city visits (and maybe, down the line, on my great return...who knows).

I feel so at home already, and this house isn't even well insulated, painted, or remotely finished in any way. And yet, it's still so beautiful and exactly what I need right now. I'm obsessed with the ducks in the pond. They swim around in packs of anywhere from three to thirty and they have yet to cease to amuse me. Their occasional quacking disrupts the quiet around here. I enjoy that. The trees are so old and tall and really powerful. I think they nearly steal the show from the pond for me. They smell so good and it literally seems like the sky is raining leaves right now. It's almost a challenge to see the contours of our yard because of the massive amounts of leaves. I want to go and rake them, simply because I love to rake, but they are actually good for the ground. So I have to leave them where they are. It isn't like we don't have enough to do; I really shouldn't waste time on futile tasks. But I want big soggy piles of leaves!!

The centerpiece of the house is definitely the stone fireplace. Bonnie's dad tried lighting the fire a while ago and smoke filled the house, so he thought it wouldn't work well as a real fireplace and went out and bought a gas fireplace/set/whatever it's called to put inside of it. When I heard that news, I was pretty bummed. But when we saw it, it was so hideous that we insisted on taking it out and trying again.  It works! Lesson learned: Dirt and moisture on a log can create way too much smoke, so before you scrap your beautiful fireplace, scrap your crappy wood.

I'll probably write more later, but I need to clean up before we had out for Bonnie's job interview. Wish the girl some luck."

"event","So, I have a stalker. It's a boy. He stares at me constantly. He follows me around. He feels the need to put his paws on me whenever he can. His name is Franco. He's my cat.

He is OBSESSED with me lately and I'm not quite sure what to do about it. He isn't like this with my girlfriend. The other cats have their moments like all cats do; but this is different. And it has only been for the last month or so.

He will sit in front of me on the coffee table STARING at me for ridiculous stretches of time, sometimes over half an hour. When I'm at the computer, he comes and sits on the table to my left and stares at me the same way. If I pat my lap, he instantly climbs on while still staring up at me, looking so thankful for my attention.

He's like a prepubescent boy experiencing blind infatuation for the first time. I feel like I have him whipped. It makes me feel dirty.

I wish I could have a little talk with him about how girls don't really like it when boys stare at them. And that I know it feels like he can't stop
wanting my attention and he can't control it, but I'm sure this obsessive feeling will pass and he'll survive. I can't give him all of the lap time and petting that he craves.

I really don't need verification that I'm always being stared at; I'm paranoid enough. Damn it Franco."

"event","RIGHT NOW:

Book I'm reading: Atonement--Ian McEwan
Listening to: Groove Is In The Heart--Deelite
Clothes I'm wearing: brown v-neck long sleeve shirt, jeans with a big hole in the knee, mismatched dark colored socks, black shoes without arch support, underwear with PINK and black stripes, white bra. Tiny silver hoop earing. Mmmhmm.

If the song changes while I'm typing my right now stuff do I have to update it? I'm now listening to Praise You by Fatboy Slim. And now I have to find Weapon of Choice by Fatboy Slim on YouTube because it sparked a conversation about the video and there is a pressing need to watch Christopher Walken dance.

And now Black Hole Sun is on by Soundgarden and I have to dedicate it to my imploding Christmas tree which is not only folding in on itself and eating all of our ornaments, but is also in the process of creating a region of space-time where escape to the outside universe is impossible (wikipedia= ""black hole""). So, anyways.

I had a lovely brunch with Bonnie and Jonathan at Manajuana where I enjoyed unlimited mimosas (I think I had four), fruit, french toast, bacon, a piece of steak, and a large chunk of chicken fat that I refused to eat.

I plan on reading the Times, at least until I get sick of reading about Hussein being hanged. Actually, I'm already sick of hearing about that; it's rather barbaric and disturbing to me. So I'm choosing to be over it and skipping to the arts & entertainment and books sections. Because I'd rather think about cultural things that illuminate my understanding of the human condition, rather than reading about what humans are actually up to these days.

Now I'm listening to Love Is Our Cross To Bear by John Gorka. I'd like to point out that I keep stopping to do other things, so it's not like I am taking so long to type two sentences that a whole new song comes on. Now it's Unsquare Dance by Dave Brubeck and my cat Franco is staring at me.

Tonight I will be going to Cafe Gigi for pizza and wine. Mmmm.

Happy New Year my loves!"

"event","Oh, it has been way too long since I've updated my blog. I even forgot my password! I had to try a dozen variations before I got it right. But all is good. I broke in and now I'm ready to post again for the first time in months.

I have to say that life is pretty damn peachy right now. I've pretty much played all day. And right now, I shit you not, Bonnie just turned on the television and the end of Ghost is on right now where Molly is seeing Sam as a ghost about to follow the light and they kiss goodbye.

I was planning on going to the theater tonight to work, but Bonnie convinced me that I should instead meet her at Washington Square Park. And I did and we ate at Suzie's where I had authentic curry chicken a strawberry daquiri and a really strong mai tai. Then we went up to Target in Marble Hill and bought a new coffee pot because our old one kicked it and my good friend Jamesdavid hooked us up with a generous gift certificate to Target so that we good get our coffee fix easily every day.

Then we came home and played Scrabble, drank coffee from our new coffeemaker, listened to This American Life. I read a little bit (currently working on Atonement by Ian McEwan because my friend Kevin loves it and recommended it).

Checked out the news. Now I'm updating my blog. I'm starting to get some job prospects...both full time real ones and an ongoing freelance gig.

My sister cut my hair and I like it. Christmas was pretty good. My niece and nephew were fun.

My niece, Grace, was so excited to play with Bonnie and I and it just made me really happy because I remember when I was about her age (three) and I got to play with my aunts and uncles and it was awesome. And it was the crazy kind of play that involves screaming and tickling that parents usually tell you to stop doing, but since we were two adults engaging them with it...it was all cool. And Gracie called Bonnie ""Aunt Bonnie"" which was sort of unexpected and totally cute. AND, Gracie asked me if I was her daddy's sister and I find that sort of amusing because it's obviously strange for her to think of her daddy having a sister. And I totally relate because I sometimes think how strange it is that my dad, WJ, is a brother and actually has several siblings. He's just such a dad, you know?

The whole family was doing well. My mom did well with her gift giving and seemed to have pretty much stopped showering us with her year-round QVC purchases.

Yes, all is good right now."

"event","I've been writing in a ""real"" journal, trading in the binary for some moleskin and ink, a lot more than usual these past few days. I got all deep in it, you'd think I was stoned. But really, I'm just deep. I know.

This is a part of what I wrote verbatim:

""I just stopped to talk to Bonnie about how much I'm loving writing lately. I can't even fully explain why, but it just always feels so good while and after I'm doing it. It's like reading. Or its like love in the way that there are a million and one ways to describe the feeling of it, almost all of them equally capturing its essence and yet never satisfying it all together. I don't even know why or how, but it just IS healthy. If I think about it, words and feelings and thoughts are going through my head all of the time. And so few of those thoughts actually get expressed, and if they do, they have to go through filters like culture and self image and so on. But you can only let so much out to other people (and if you're lucky, you have some people who you can be unusually open with in your every day life...as I am). But what happens to all of that other stuff? All of those thoughts and feelings that occur and don't really go anywhere, but either come and go only to return again and again and again, or go by and leave before being appreciated, or wont go anywhere no matter what else you try to concentrate on? I think most of those thoughts turn into things. Neurosis. Stress. Fears. Ennui. Obsession. Skewed reality. I can't think of very much that is good that comes from unexpressed thoughts and feelings. Well, actually, for some people I can think of, suppression probably wouldn't hurt (read: Anne Coulter)."""

"event","So I'm at work putting used books online. Monotonous right? Never. Take the current book I am entering for example. It is a mystery called Gas Head Willy by Richard J. Thomas. Signed by the author to Henry Czerny, an actor in such blockbuster hits at Mission Impossible and the Pink Panther. The message says, ""For Henry Czerny- Who Will You Play in the Film? Enjoy! Richard J. Thomas."" And you'd think that would be fantastic. A collectible! 

But...there is also a doodle in pen of a naked man on the inside front pages. As well as a stick figure trapped in a web. So...how do I actually describe this on my amazon item description?

That is all."

"event","I recently finished a book by Kevin Baker called Dreamland. It is ""a novel breathtaking in its scope of ambition, it is the epic saga of newcomers drawn to the promise of America-gangsters and laborers, hucksters and politicians, radicals, reformers, murderers, and sideshow oddities-whose stories of love, revenge, and tragedy interweave and shine in the artificial electric dazzle of a wondrous place called Dreamland.""

This book is one of those fantastic historical fiction novels that make me slightly cringe at calling it fiction. Baker meticulously researched the time period, including the people, politics, and major events that actually happened and existed. He successfully gives the reader an accurate portrayel of the lives of early 20th century New York immigrants.

Did you know that there was an attraction at Coney Island called Liliputia that was a tiny recronstructed Nuremburg populated by midgets and dwarfs? It's true. People would pay to watch them go about their daily lives. Over 300 midgets and dwarfs lived in Liliputia, even when the park was not open. They even had their own fire department; while it responded to at least one false fire alarm a day just to give the spectators a show, they actually did respond to a real fire in 1911 that burned Dreamland to the ground.

Anyway, I just wanted to share a good writer with those who are interested. <a href=""http://www.kevinbaker.info"">KevinBaker.info</a>"

"event","Whenever I make a major change in my life, like moving to a new place, I retrace the places and people and choices that resulted in me living in my current situation. And then I compare how my life is now to how I pictured my life would be ten or so years ago. With a certain degree of shame, I am about to admit that my current situation is very similar to some documentary I had seen on MTV many many years ago (maybe when I was in junior high or early high school).

The documentary, if that's even what it was...it could have been just a regular episode of some random tv show for all I remember...was about relationships of twentysomethings. First major breakups. First true loves. The whole gamut. There was a young couple, maybe mid-twenties, and they were moving into an apartment together. I'm fairly confident it was in NYC. And I remember a shot of the boyfriend and girlfriend lightly bickering under the stress of lifting some heavy furniture up a staircase. And I just remember thinking they looked really cool. Like they were so grown up and that they had their own place and their own furniture and they were ready to committ to something serious.

And when I watched that, it seemed like a lifestyle that was so foreign to me that it didn't even occur to me that my life could be even close to that. I thought I'd be dating a man, somewhere in the burbs, working some typical job. Nothing outside of what I already knew.

But here I am. In an apartment. In New York City (never saw that coming). With a girlfriend. With incredibly diverse friends. I drink wine and tea...hardly ever soda. I say soda now instead of pop. I read books. I don't give a shit about the Real World or MTV (honestly, I remember wondering if I'd ever get bored with the Real World and MTV...this was a legitamate curiosity to me). I have short hair and I'm not ashamed of it. I have rather large breasts and I'm ok with it. I have cats. CATS. I am one of those people who has not driven a car in months...soon I will be a person who hasn't driven a car in years. I talk politics. I don't even believe in god anymore. I do believe in acupuncture however.

All of these things. All of these things that have happened to or changed within me. It's amazing. And I'm so happy. Happier than I imaginged was possible.

Sometimes I don't know why I'm so lucky. But then I think for a moment, and then I conclude that life fucking owed me a moment...because that whole childhood thing was fucking hard."

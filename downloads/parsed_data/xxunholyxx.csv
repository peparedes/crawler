"event","Comedian Hedberg, once called 'next Seinfeld,' dies at 37 

April 2, 2005


 



ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Comedian Mitch Hedberg, whose wide-ranging career included work in nightclubs, television and film, died this week. He was 37.

Mr. Hedberg, who struggled with drugs and alcohol, died Wednesday in a hotel room in Livingston, N.J.

Pending the medical examiner's report, the cause of death appears to be heart failure, said his mother, Mary Hedberg of St. Paul. She said her son was born with a heart defect and frequently felt anxious about his condition.

Mary Hedberg said speculation that her son's death was drug-related was gossip.

''We don't know that for a fact,'' she said, but added, ''it's not a secret Mitch used drugs. Whether that played a role in his death or not, we don't know.''

A hit on ''Late Show With David Letterman,'' on which he appeared 10 times, and ''The Howard Stern Show,'' Mr. Hedberg once was dubbed ''the next Seinfeld'' by Time magazine. But TV-series fame eluded him because his unique style of mumbled one-liners didn't lend itself to the sitcom format.

Mr. Hedberg delivered absurdist, random observations in a spacy staccato. His long, dirty blond hair harkened to the image of a 1970s stoner. 

""Rice is great when you're hungry and you want 2,000 of something,"" he declared.

Another gag surmised, ""Foosball is a combination of soccer and shish kebabs.""

Jokes about Mr. Hedberg's drug use were a staple of his act. He took a hiatus from performing for several months after a May 2003 arrest in Austin, Texas, for felony possession of heroin.

Born in St. Paul, Mr. Hedberg rose through the ranks at Minneapolis' Acme Comedy Co. and caught his big break through a Comedy Central special.

His rambling, non-sequitur style often drew comparisons to Steven Wright, but Mr. Hedberg disagreed.

''If I made potato chips and put them in a can, people would say I was ripping off Pringles,'' he said. ''But what if I put them in a bag?''

Mr. Hedberg had two popular comedy CDs, ''Strategic Grill Locations'' and ''Mitch All Together.'' He acted in the movie ''Almost Famous'' -- smoking fake pot with Peter Frampton -- and appeared on Fox's hit series ''That '70s Show.''

"event","Cyfair did one of the middle school pre UIL things Thursday, signed up to do stage crew... ya know just because i can.

Anywayz, me and travis were pretty much running around the whole time trying to find chairs and set up the warmup room. After that was done we ran to the band room and had to set up the sight readin' room the same way... sept without any gay chairs, just the really good ones. When i was settin up the stands, i was flippin them all right-side up and pulling them up so the kids wouldnt have to... anywayz this one really jewish one came off and i almost lost my balance and fell backwards =/ After that was done, the first band showed up, which i think was goodson... either way we had to run and finish setting up the stage for their performance. Dane had this paper that was just x's o's and rectangles all over the place... Anyone know that those really big risers are heavy when your holding them above your head... eeesh. When the band would be playing... stage crew (Me Travis Chirs Quy Nollan Issabel) played cards... and when they would finish we would set up for the next band using their extremly cut lil' drawings of squares and x's. There was this one that made NO SENSE at all. It was a rainbow... with 2 sets of numbers at the ends with t's under them. ... ... ... It turned out being chairs/stands with no risers but it was confusing. :P I saw my old band director from middle school and was talkin to him for awhile before Hamilton performed. Clearly, band directors dont change much over years *shrugs* Hollstein orderd us all pizza and drinks... although i dont think laura jason or rachel got any... they were kinda stuck in the sight reading room while stage crew and just other helpers went at the shit :P At the end, me chris travis and laura had to put all the chairs away... 60 choir room and 35 orchestra... Ended up finishing at a lil' over 9ish. 

Enough of this. I wanna go do somethin, anyone interested innnn.... ... .... Ya know ill let you decide :P"

Lotsa lil things that have ya know... no relavince to anything at all... have been occuring though. Fer one... Charles stole Rahul's paint spray paint can from in his slot... took it home... and blew it up with Garrett. Hes still been complainin bot his damn paint can... and its been like what, 2 maybe 3 weeks? Pfff.... Oh oh... I think im going to have bbb? lunch? I think? Its the lunch where you have an elective 4th period. Whichever that one is *nods* I got moved into symphonic band, which is 4th period... Gunna either screw my schedual up COMPLETLY or just move my chemistry L to 3rd period... which i hope they do. I like all my classes... besides that fact that chemisty was my favorite :( Its the only class that i acually have friends that ya know... are friends. Not just people i know. Well that and 6th period but theres no way in hell they can switch that class so im in the green there. oh and... german... but theres just no way they would give me german 4th peroid... and after thinkin about what i just said ... no shit they arent going to give me german 4th ill have band then *slaps self* So ya all SHOULD be well.... Moving on to more recent things... Well ok not really more recent... just.. ok ... ya. Thats right. Theres going to be absolutly no time synch in this fregin entry... i mean.. i should have told u there would be none at the begging BUT HERE IT IS!!! IN THE MIDDLE!!! WHAT THE BOOF!? Oh well.

Halo... OMG EWWWW. Halo pc is so nasty... 'specially sense those damn computers at netzone cant handle it. Such a horible multiplayer game to begin with... they just had to fregin make multiplayer for halo1 didnt they... fregin tards. Not gunna go on a rant bout it.. think ive done that enough about the damn game. halo2 though, multiplayer is really nice. No cheap shit like scopes on pistols that kill u in 3 shots. Ok seriousla wtf... a scope... on a pistol is bad enough... but when you dont even PUT.... A VISUAL SCOPE ON IT.... then we have a problem. Theres no scope on it.. yet u can scope hmmm... kkkkk.... ill go with ya on that one... just cause ya cant change it anymore ya'know? e_e Right. I know there was something that we played for more than half the time i just cant remember what the bloody boof it was. I know we barley played cs for 30 minutes... UNREAL TOURNY 2004... Oh wow that game is godlike if ur computer can handle it.. such smooth graphics and gameplay... plus its a 24/7 bloodbath. So much fun! ^^

We started by warming up inside... and within the first 5 minutes of the day... stupid fucking freshmen in my section think its funny as hell to be sarcastic and breath like they are gasping for air really fucking loud and venstra gets this... im going to rip your balls off and force feed u with them until u drop dead look in his eyes and just goes.. euphoniums raise your hands so like.. we did and in this really like.. calm but u can clearly tell he's pissed off voice... he says ""Promise me that was the last joke you will putt today"" and like... we just glared at those retards with death stares...  Anywayz, we went outside to practice on the football feild 'round 745 and it was muuuudddddyyyyy. Venstraa was sayin that Young thought it would be a good idea not to wear our shoes outside so they dont get all wet and nasty smelling from the grass and so ya naturally everyone but a few people listen so we all take off our shoes... and socks...

..
...

bad idea. So we are on the wet feild barefoot marching in mud. Oh wow that was definitly a smart move on everyones part let meh tell ya. Glump glump goes the mud under Grumpywumps feet... ugh. I really didnt mind it sept for when ya.. we held for a few beats cause every time we stood still... i was in a giant circle of mud... which was really fregin gay. Also when we reharsed this one part where we move up and back really fast... i kept digging my feet into the ground and my toe god coverd in mud. Blah. Ya so we were out there till eh... 11? maybe 1025? somethin round there. Anywayz, right when we got on the charter bussess i break my headphones. Ok what the fuck your obviously kidding... So im like rar and then when i get to my seat in the back i slam my head into the ceiling... rar again... i sit down realizing that i forgot to get the food that was up at the front so i stand up IN MY SEAT and wham... head... right into ceiling... so ya im like RAR exlamation mark exlamation mark by this time. Got the food... ate it... was like ok this is all going to be good. Open up my gameboy and i missing fuxing pokemon crystal... now im pissed. Nothing to do all the way fucking down to san antonio. AHH!!!!!!!! Oh ya... after that our bus driver stand up and is like.. if anyone needs me or speaks to me you will refer to me as Nikki. Not Miss Nikki, not mam. Just Nikki. So the rest of the time when me and Blanchard were talkin bout the busdriver we reffered to her as ""Plain ol' Nikki"" Rar anywayz... They put a movie on. Robin Hood Men in Tights... gotta love that movie. Doesnt get much better ya'know? Then Petty pulls out this Uber l33t haxz0rin' coloring book of yogi bear... tom and jerry.. flintstones... Omg COLORING TIME1!!!1 >.< Blanchard found a yogi picture ... and... scribbled over it with a brown crayon.. and said he was done SO i found a picture and colored yogi pink... purple hat green tie.. oh ya. HE BE PIMPIN! PIMP YOGI GUNNA PIMP U TONIGHT FOO! Watched a lil bit of badder santa on marks laptop... it was a pretty funny movie, the parts i saw atleast. He let me borrow his headphones which owned... until i realized I had the wrong fregin cd which was gayyyyyyy.
Getting back to the bad things about the busride... we sat at the back of the bus meaning 2 things... 1) Trashbags.. hanging off the sides of our seats.. where ALL THE TRASH WENT. It wasnt the smell... it was the amount of room it took up i mean christ... THERE WAS NO ROOM ANYMORE! Damm trashcans... the other thing omg.... ill hit on that later. It has to do with the bathroom.
So ya after i got bored of coloring in the coloring book and after seeing Coolrunnings for about the 20th time ever... I got pretty uhhh hella bored. We arrived 5 minutes later which is always good.
Got off the bus and put our uniforms on... and went over to warm up. Over there he gave us motivational speech like he always does and then we went and performed. Wasnt hot... nice feild.. so we owned. We made 5th place in the prelims and 1-10 go to finals in area so we were like yaaaaaay. Ugh...

Right right. Cant remember much of the weekend so SCREW THE WEEKEND.

Hahaha.. Yestarday we had UIL. It was pretty tight, leaving school at 1 and all was a biggy on my fav list. I havnt decided if i like my 6th period class yet or not... cause i mean, i know some of the people in there, but their preps... along with everyone else in the class. The people that fuckin sit 'round me are always talkin bout drugs and blah blah blah... god i hate these damn people in my class. Anoying much? I don't see how my teacher puts up with it, shes like the most mild temperd teacher ive ever seen. Right anywayz gettin off track a'lil there. We left fer da stadium and huh... cant remember the busride up. I know it was tight though ya know cause their always fun. When we got to the stadium Venstra was in his ussual ""Not in a hurry"" mood, so we all stood there just pissin round fer 30 minutes. 
He made us go down and practice on the feild for ""an hour"". Ha... Haha... LIES. 1:45 much?! Blah. The band parents gave us some food and then venstra like... OMG OMG OMG WE HAVE 15 MINUTES TO EAT GET DRESSED DO WHATEVER AND GO OVER TO THE SCHOOL TO WARM UP. So everyone like... dot dot dot. 
After we got in the warmup room we played a choral.. and that was it. The rest of the time the drum majors and teachers gave oh so inspiring speeches, which really weren't that bad at all. We walked back over to the stadium and saw the very end of cy creeks show, then we went on the feild blah blah blah perfom blah blah. Got off the feild and uhhh.. speaking for everyone, felt like falling over and just laying there fer a bit. Ya definitly just on the spot falling over and probably wishing not to be botherd. Stayed and watched 2 or 3 bands perform then got our rating, first division oh ya bitches. We get to go to area nexttt monday and skip the whole day of school. ^^
The bus ride back... that was fun. Sense my assigned bus was one of the buses that left, i got to choose any bus i wanted so like... partah bus all da way. So fun... specially when we were yelling random crap out the window to the other bands busses that was just comin in... and uhhh... apparently we yelled ""Whats your number"" to a uhhh... equipment truck. ... ... ... Interesting.

Im done with my boringness of band stories for now.. i think... unless i can remember anything at all that happend this weekend and or during school... Oh ya.

My english teacher asked me why i wasnt in K level classes and i was like uhhhh...... I failed out of them and shes like uh..huh... Another thing... Im learnin ta play da french horn! Go me! I can play uhhh uhhh uhh a c... scale.. ... ... yaaa... hmm... and american riversongs! But only on a melaphone so eh. Oh yes last thing, Football game 'gainst creek. That game fucking owned... 3 ways... 1) The acuall football game just... freakin owned hard ass. 2)I got to see Jaymi Paige Michelle 3) It was the 8th grade game meaning there were 8th graders playing with us in the stands it was pretty tight. I guess one more thing 4) being that uhhh... got to sit by some friends that would acually do stuff, not just bloody sit there and stare blatanly into the giant lights. Oh ya that was coo.

Oh oh oh... Ya theres like this really really really tight game that i found. Its in open beta right now which = no pay of the money yet. One thing though... its in all german. :o otherwise its like totally competly bad ass. And thats where my weekend went i remember now! e_e

Was up at school at 9 am... they made us reharse till 11 30 ish, and then they were like... Oh em gee we reharsed over the schedualed time GET ON DA BUS. *sigh*

Anywayz, on the busride up jason lent me Pokemon Crystal (shut... up...) Its pretty tight played it the whole way up. When we got there venstra made sure we were ready to go on and perform so he made us put everything on in the bus instead of the ussual take everything off the bus and get dressed after warmup. So ya anywayz there was this lil yellow bug and like flew onto my glove and kinda sat there...the whole time... named it George. All the girls thought he was hot <3 <3 <3 no not really they were like AH BUG AH. Hehehe..

Ya the performance went alot better this time seeing how i didnt just all of a sudden run into the field blatantly by myself. La la performed de de daaaaaaa... anddddd ok now. Everyone had to stay and watch Jv and Falls perform which was really cool cause falls has like... the greatest show eva and Jv has some pretty tight music. Anwyayz... after those 2 shows he told us we could either go home now or stay and watch the rest of the shows and the awards. Eh, i stayed, thought it would be fun. Some of the shows were fregin amazing after Jv. Tomballs show is kinda funny... There was this soloist trumpet player and the rest of the trumpets fold out their arms like wings and run around him. There was this other band that made a swastika to begin with... that was kinda uhhh.. odd. Anywayz, i should have bought a tap arg but i didnt have my money... Dane was sayin somethin bout like... when he went over to the tap place that alot of the people really liked cy fairs show. I dont see how really.. no idea. we have like Zero visuals. *sigh*

K. Woke up at 6 this mornin to get ready for a Bands of America so ya. Got there 30 minutes early with my section to polish our horns... god mines so freakin rusty and shit the polish really really didnt help that much but oh well it looked alot better then it did before ill give it that much. So Venstra's like... ok put on your ponchos we're going outside to march and its raining blah blah blah.. i swear every 15 minutes we were out there he would say... ""we're only going to be out here for about another 15 minutes"" Ya ok sure why not *shrug* Oh god the busride up there was soooooo fun! So i slept the first 10 minutes of it... what do u want from me i was tired give meh a break :P Kevin let us listen to his dell... ipodish not ipodish thing and it had some coo songs on it ... Bumble bee, White reflectoin, Ect... There was this one german techno song though by the Wise men or wise guys w/e ... it was called Tekkno. hahaha... it was tight. It was a techno song but... there were no instruments... the guys would just made the soungs omg it was such a nice song i want it to have my children. The rest of the way up we were all singin just random songs... blah blah blah. We get to the school and OMG we had to walk up this fucking huge hill and it was like ARG GOING TO DIE! It was hot out... we were wearing our long black pants... carrying our instruments... jackets.. waterjugs... hats.. shit in hats... oh god. As soon as we got up the first hill what'a ya know... theres another! How lovely. Arghz0r :P


So the whole time we are doing everything.. Venstra was like ""theres no rush."" So like we are not rushing... all of a sudden EVERYONE GET IN TEH STADIUM PUT YOUR WHOLE UNIFORM ON NOW GET IN THERE GO GO GO. So im like... WHAT THE HELL! Everyones already walkin in there with their uniform and im still holding everything in my hands. So im the last bloody one in there im RUNNING TO THE FREGIN BLOCK and as soon as i get there the tap off goes and i had to start marching oh em gee i was already tired from sprinting and then i had to march the show THAT WAS GRAND! Oh boy. Oh joy. So we played.... played... played some more. Ok so when we are getting off the feild im lookin around and everyone was sweating so hardcore. One of my friends literally... had a fucking waterfall comin off the back of his head. The whole top of the thick jacket was soacked. Thats hard to do if u pour water on it.


So as we are walkin' down to get our picture taken these ppl had to stamp our hands to get back into the stadium. Ok ... COMMON SENSE NEEDS TO KICK IN RIGHT NOW. Small stamp + Extremly sweaty ppl. Does anyone understand what happend to everyone stamp... im just curious. Anywayz apparently the stamp didnt matter and ill get back to that later. We took a picture as a whole group... seroius ones and unseroius ones blah blah. Then we branch off into sections (only if we wanted to) to get our pictures done that way. So like we put on our care faces ( -_- ) (<--- Care face) And looked off into the right with just our eyes it looked kinda freaky. Next pic was the goofy one... we took off our gauntlets and wore them as pirate hats. ARG MATT'EIS!! Starred off into the distance with our heads this time... it was pretty good too got the directors to laugh.


Went in and sat down at the stadium again and waited fer the awards and stuff blah blah. We got a division 2 which really surprised me do to how much we sucked in the first movement.. rar that blew anywayz. Ya we got like 11th or 12th  and they only take top 10 to finals with the amount of bands that came so we left early and got home round 8. The bus ride back... omg all i did was listen to The DDR song Bumble Bee, White reflection, andddd oh god what was it. Hold on let me think... SCARS IN TIME! omg that song is sooooo sexy. I want to huggle it to death for being so coo. Its like hardcore flute and either chello or violein.. my guess is vio but i wouldnt know. Hhahahahah right when it got really really dark outside on the bus charles took out his camera phone and told me to take a picture of something... and i didnt know what to take a pic of so he goes ""dude take a pic of toasty"" and im like ""But its to dark"" Hes like just do it so i was like Hey Toasty, he turns and this big ass bright flash goes off right in his face he was like AHHHHH OMG MY EYES! lololol... i didnt know the damn camera had a flash so for the rest of the ride home (bout 45 minutes) just sat there.. flashing ppl in the fause with the camera phone. Quite fun... quite fun.


Got home only to find everyone was on star wars galaxies... blah such a crappy game i wouldnt bother soiling my hands with it. I wouldnt bother soiling my money with it either.. 10 - 15 $ a month... ppfff blow me fregin pay to play shit. harharharharharh. Seroiusla though... even if that game was free and my comp could run it... nah i still wouldnt play it. Its just that horrible *shrug*


GUNBOUND TIME!!! Hahaha. So im playin with jarred and hes like omg matt your going to kill me and im like no im not so i kill him and the next game omg... that was lame as hell. I got him down to no life and i still had full. He shoots and on impact my gunbound crashes. God damn i hate it when it does that. Just picks the most RANDOM TIMES to crash. Grawr. Quite right. After words Starcraft was the key game where we played BOMB SADAM! God that game is so funny XD RUN SADAM RUN!!!! >>>>>.<<<<< Eh youd have to play it to understand :o Anwayz, ty sooo much fer gettin meh those songs jaymi la la la BUMBLE BEE OF DOOM!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA... Cant get enough of it

Anywayz wow it was hella hot. I dont ussually complain about the wearther or the heat or blah blah blah but christ when your just standing ... in the sun for 4 hours it tends to get on your nerves a tad naw what'a mean. So like at the last 5 minutes of practice i droped my instrument on the ground cause i was so damn tired and now there is a dent in the bell. Rar. So not cool. I felt like crap ever sense i woke up that day so ya practice was really rough. Not only that i had an xbox party directly following practice.

Netzone lockin on friday was pretty cool. It wasnt full which really surpised me but oh well. Played some wc3, cs, alien vs pred 2 (which i shall mention again later :P) They have a CS Tourny so i signed up my clan for it. It was a 4v4 tourny and we won it. Loffly beating of ppl up. Anywayz ya people were getting mad at me cause i was shooting them through walls and stuff. I just love it when people yell hacker out it makes u feel funny. You want to laugh in their face and yell at them for being stupid at the same time. ^^

Played Alien vs Pred 2 with jason and this guy next to me. Omg it was so great. I didnt know that marines could climb into the mechs but you can! My friends wanted alein lifecycle on which means that they start as these lil' things that cant deal damage but latch onto your face and kill you in one hit so they can evolve (lame) anywayz... i got in the mech and they couldnt grab onto me so i fregin was like AHHHHHHHHH BANG BANG BANG RAR. It was funny as hell cause they would just swarm me and try to hurt me but they couldnt. Hehhehe... Later i took alien lifecycle off and they started jumping at me. Most the time they were both runners so they would just leap of faith at my face... SO I FLAME THEM. They have a thing that when they kill me they eat my body.. and yell feeding time. Blast them.. i counter with frying u with flame thrower then pulling out my knife on yo' body fo! har har, victory to me.

Got home 'round 730 and played gunbound till like 9 when i fell back asleep. I awakend at 3 and got ready to go to lazerquest with my section in band. Everyone went 'sept for Quy and Derek... Blah would have been better if they were there. Anywayz, We all bought 3 games. I used Grumpywump as my name (hehe yeeeeeeah) I got a 3rd place and 2 1st. Owned much yes ok good. I was in 1st for the greatest score for the day... sept the game that it happend the guy mispelled my name ... Grumpwimpi. W00t... grump...wimpi... ugh.

Played time crisis 2 with vincent for awhile... Hehehe.. You know how you have to press the pad to come up? His was like.. uber broken but still worked IF U SMASH IT. So when he wanted up he was like AHHHHHHHHHH *smash*

Got home and watched arfenhouse. never gets old. No way can that flash get old it just no it doesnt. Got on SC wit meh pplz and played a lil ffa here a lil gums there. Eh, rest the day was pretty boring and omg im sooo hella tired. :O Peacey meh friendys! ^^

"event","Yestarday was the band lockin at this uhh.. place... if i remember ill write it in ^.^' its like this family center over by the public library. Anywayz... The lockin totally owned, just like last years. First thing,we ran into the backroom and set up a gamecube on the big tv they had hanging up. Yeaaaaaah. Played a round of smash then had to go listen to venstraa. After that we sat there and played smash for a bit, then i headed downstairs and watched a few of my friends play texas hold'em. Quy was like... dominating in chips. Nobody else had like anything. Went into the gym and played a lil basketball, came out and all of quys chips were gone and he was like ARGHHHHHHH. lol... Headed back upstairs and played some air hockey with some of my friends THEN BACK TO TEH SMASH!!! There were 4 tvs downstairs that ppl brought and played halo on... gah what morons. Fregin xbox loones. They bore me. Sn0rz0r.
People started gathering around the smash... the way we traded off was first person out of the 4v4 had to give up. I neeeverrr gave it up. Harharharh.. i ownz0r them newbzies. Lil freshemn that were like OH IM GOD!!!! Then get their asses beat in.. its so great. Love it!!! Jeff and Sean came over and owned me and this random guy i was partners with... and they were there for awhile. They never lost sept to me and Andrew. Then we started setting it on tourny mode so ya'know, everyone could play. Out of the 5 we had, i won 2 of them. It was tight, Sean won 2 of them, and then when we all left someone else won.. Blah whateva. I was pichu NO PROBLEM!! :P Anywayz, that went on for the rest of the lockin. It was fun! OH YA! Toothbrush thingy! 10 seniors sign up for it.. repeat... sign up for it. What happens is there is a coke on the table, a cup, and a toothbrush. The first person brushes their teeth, then drinks the coke, and spits it in the cup. Then next person has to put the toothbrush in the cup, and brush their teeth with it. REPEAT THE PROCESS!! XD The last person has to drink all the stuff the other ppl spit up. Its so nasty but its so funn to see the pplz faces. Jay fregin looked over at the remaining guy, took off his sandle and brushed it with the the brush then put it in the cup. Ugh lol its so great. The talent show ownz, theres always some singers (which are really hella good)last year there were 2 ravers (which were also hella good) then theres always some of ther stuff like fencing and blah blah blah. 

Today wasnt that grand, satardays never are. wanted to do something but nobody could so eh. Played gunbound with some friends, reinstalled sc and cs, which is always nice, and finished off the day. Eh, oh well *shrug* PEACEEEEEEE!!!!!!!111!111!

Wow, first period was decent, didnt talk to anyone but the teacher keeps the room coo. Always talking and giving instructions... its almost like someone talking to you, but ya never say anything back ya'know?

Omg algebra was boring even though the teacher is coo... she just left us alone to work on this worksheet for 20 minutes. Eh, just like any other math class i guess.

After school i headed to the bandhall and saw hilary so i was like YO WAZZAP!!! We talked fer bout eh.. 45 minutes in the hallway.. it was all good. Its like i dunno, i became very social over night? what the boof is with that. Hhehehehe... whateva atleast im social nahimean!!! Har..harharh...har.... Was outside waiting by the school for my ride fer a bloody hour reading my book when my friend walks up and is like ""have you seen my sister"" I was like uhhh uhh.. i dont know your sister and hes like ""short blonde"" im like uhhh.. no. So hes like ""lets go look for her"" and im like ok. so we went around the whole bloody school lookin fer his sister and we get outside by the bandhall again about 20 minutes later and hes like... man i wish i had my cellphone. I pulled mine out and hes like blah... i dont know my sisters number but eh he calls his mom WHO HAD APPARENTLY PICKED HIS SISTER UP!!! Gar silly parental units.

Anywayz i got picked up and so im sittin here thinkin should i tell her i missed the buss... then im like wait... our neighbor drove me there so she is bound to find out and get uber pissed with me cause i didnt tell her.

Now that i KNOW the way she goes i can just catch it soooo much easier but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Lets not trust matt. So apparently my mom is having my neighboor make sure i get on the bus at the right stop... so im like.. what the fuck is this its so gay seriousla... this is soo mother fucking GHEY I CANT STAND IT WHEN SHE DOES SHIT LIKE THIS!!

SO I GET ON! and the bus goes... next thing ya'know she goes up where she took a right and took a right TO GO WHERE SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE AWHILE AGO TO PICK ME UP! RAWR!!!

Ok anywayz... so we get to school ontime.. (i think?) and when we get off im just walkin with my cd player on and this ap goes ""Escuse me could u come here for a second?"" and he tells me of this new policy bout no cd players. WHAT... THE.... FUCK!!!! I CANT MAKE IT THROUGH SCHOOL WITHOUT LISTENING TO MUSIC!! GHEEEEEEYYYY!!!!! GGGGGGGHHHHHEEEEEEEYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!

To the performance gym i go! I was walkin down thar with someone but now i dont remember so EH! I get over there and i see no one i know so i cry! cry cry not really but thats not quite important right now. Next thing... im headin down the hallway to first when i see paige and jaymi walkin on down to get their shedys. I dont think anyone realizes that i nod at people instead of saying hi... i swear cause like ill nod to someone then later ill see them and theyll be like YOU DIDNT SAY HI!! and ill be like uhhh...... UHHHHHHH... *nod*

OK!!! Kinda wonderd around for a bit cause my first period (world history with Mrs. Wilson) was in the room i had first period health last year... rrright... So i's walked over just to make sure then turned around to head to see if anyone still gatherd next to the librairy where we used to play hacky-sack... nobody was there i was like :O WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Must be a first day thing. Eh...

Now im in first period... 3 minutes before the bell rings and im the first person in class... that says something about whos im my class. Fregin slackers and preps GOD... damnnnnnnnnit. Anywayz... the teacher told us to sit down in alphabetical order on our owns... oh ya that took at good 8 minutes to do. Nobody said a thing they just kinda sat down then someone would be like ""my last names starts with a blahhhhhhhhhhhhh"" and the person would move. THEN SOMEONE WOULD COME IN LATE! AND WE HAD TO MOVE BACK!!!!!!!!!!! GAHHHHHHHH! There were 3 different times someone new came in. We had to change seats EVVVVERY TIME! Lameified. The teacher tells us about blah blah blah blah blah blah.... blahhhh...... BLAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

blah much?

What is second period omg i forgot let me think... uhhh.... hold on.

...
...
...
...
...

OMG HOLD ON LET ME THINK GAH! (thinking outloud (aka typing) is kinda creepy O.o)

ALGEBRA II!!! there we go i got it nua.
The teacher is so cool! Shes so nice and shit its cool. Once again a classroom full of people i dont know. This time its not preps though. ITS CHEERLEADER/BRIGADE/COLORGUARD/WIGGERS! GOOD... FUCKING... GAME!!!!!!!!

Blaaaahhhhh..... Juniors ... thats all that are in my classes NO SOPHMORES JUST JUNIORS! I should cry

Next thing that comes... BAND!! yes pplz i know! I got martin this year (aka concert 1) Martins a total badass i swear. You ask anyone and they will agree with it. Anywayz... venstraa tells us about all this shittt blah blah lockin this friday blahhhhhhhhhh then we had to play our instruments. Well... me and Vincent didnt have... our instruments so we walked to 507 and the door was locked... so we walked back.. got the keys from martin... USE THE BLUE KEY!!!!!! ..... Walked back and opend the door. The door to the chior room was open from there so the second we open the door we are staring into the eyes of all these chior kids so we were like uhhh... Ran in there and look for our instruments for about 3 minutes... got them walked out the door.. closed it ... locked it... put the keys in my pocket when vincent goes... ""my case feels light"" he opens it AND HIS HORN AINT IN IT!! Got the keys out again and opend the door... then we looked around for another 3 minutes and couldnt find his bloody horn so we just left and locked the door and took the keys back to martin who was conducting a warmup for everyone. I get to my slot and there aint nowhere to put my instrument.. ugh.. so i threw it in a freshmans slot (the case that is) got out my marching instrument case and took out my spare mouthpeices. NONE OF THEM FIT MY CONCERT HORN! Ugh... got the case BACK OUT... put the concert horn up and took my marching horn over to sit down and play.. i played forl ike 2 minutes then we stopped cauase the bell was about to ring. WHAT A BLOODY WASTE OF TIME!!!!

Off to lunch... Ugh... i sat with the only people i knew. Scott, John, Garret, Max, and Brendon. i got me a clux deluxe (hehehe yes indeedy) i love those things.. there so gooooood! Couldnt brake tradtion so i had to ask for a dime from someone to get a drink :P Somethings just havnt changed ya'know?

Next thing i know im in Chemistry with once again... JUNIORS I DONT KNOW!! I knew Pennick, and Max, and their juniors... Crappy peice of crap crap classes crap die crap! The teacher seemed really laid back like... someone thats tired and doesnt really care which is cool cause those are ussually the coo teachers. Anywayz... she showed us this mephane bubble thingy where she would blow a bubble of mephane and this guy had a stick on fire... anywayz... you would shove the flame in the bubble and the bubble would EXPLODE IN A FIREY BLAZE OMG ITS SO TIGHT!!! ^________^ It was the first class we had to do work in.. eh wasnt so bad. Next i headed to german! HEHEHEHEE FUN FUN!!!

Saw one of my junior friends in the hallway i was like YO! He was like ... ... .. .. .. .. .. ? I was like Hair... he was like.. OMG YOU CUT YOUR HAIR! Laugh laugh.. then TO GERMAN! Barely made it through the middle of the hallway.. its so hard to find breaks in the line when ppl dont know where the fuck they are going :P When i got into bauskes room... half the ppl were from my german class the year before which is coo i knew ppl atleast. THE CLASS WAS SO SMALL!! it was like 20 ppl! ok not small but for german and normally seeing like 40 ppl in that room WAS SMALL!!!! Bauske has a new toy... its this plastic white bladed sword with a sparkly pink handle that makes machine gun/bomb/lazer sounds. Hahahaha... He anounced that we are not allowed to speak english EEEEVVVVERRRRR again the whole year. Last year we had breaks where we would speak english a day a week or somthin like that but not anymore. Straight german or you get points off :O German was fun like it always is... i got a lil headache from laughin so much but it went away quickly. 

Last period of the day and its english oh god oh no what a crappy subject oh my my my... THE TEACHER IS PIMP!!! Shes like... super hyper and shit but shes cool! English isnt going to be boring this year.. well it might sense eveyrone in there is a damn prep.. but hey the teacher is cool so im happy. I was kinda worried that they might have us take that Summer reading book exam today and i had only read about ... 5 pages... hehhee... I admit .. i was worried about somthing other then another person.) I cant let my grades drop this year. I. CANT. LET. THEM. DROP. That would be bad but then again they probably aint gunna sense theres no one to talk to in my classes. Probably get straight a's this year.. i hope. ^^

Stayed after for band.. got into the bandhall and stood around for a bit when mrs holstein came out and was like ""QUINTON BILL! WHERE ARE YOU?"" And i was like... can i sitll pass off? she was like ya go with these 2. THEY NEVER CAME. I didnt sign up and i showed up...they signed up and blew it off. Thats.. kinda odd but oh well. Passed off the song EZ. I coulda had it done a week ago when i tried the first time but nooo the trumpets in the room with me fucked it up sooo bad that he couldnt tell if anyone was playing it right.. which i know i was blah.. on them trumpets... blah on them Freshman trumpets!!! BLEEEEHHHHHHH!!! :P

Had to wait outside... for an hour and 45 minutes sitting against the school waiting for someone to pick me up. I made some nice ant friends that thought it would be funny to crawl on me for a bit. Didnt really mind.. had my CD player on and they never bit me so it was fine with me. DO WHAT U WANT IT DONT BOTHER ME ANTS!! (just dont bite meeeee!! ^^)

Headache.. ouch.. headache... God why am i getting headaches all of a sudden? that is like.. not cool what so-eva.

This is like.. just a thought. ANYONE WANNA MOVE INTO MY CLASSES?! PLZ?! THE WORKS EASIER THEN THIS PRE AP AND K STUFF I SWEAR!!! LESSSSS STREEESSSSS FO' YO' FRIEND?!?!?! Blasphemy.

Ending note: Freshman are funny... Just because they are... One came into my 8th period (8001) and was like... WHERS THE 7000's??!?!?! ... well to get here you passed them soooooo.. hehehe... fishy fishy! D LUNCH! NO FISHY FLAKES FOR U!!!!"

OK! Here we go. Got on teh compz0r and play areofighters for meh SNES emulator.. and i got this ship called Rabio. Its this cute lil rabbit guy that flys around with a cape on blowing the shit outa stuff. WHAT FUN! ^^

Anywayz, Jarred came over 'round 3 to pick up some of his cards he had lent to jason who had left the cards here for me to give them back to jarred next time he came down.

... Clap once if u understand what i just said.

Ok, he traded me this one card that ive been needin fer awhile and now i almost finished my deck! w00t w00t. Thing is im still missing a bunchy of stuffy so i put proxies in there.. ugh im so anti proxy but im never going to get these cards sooo bottoms up on teh proxies? ^^'

ooo... went to band today. 6-9. ugh. I did realize something as i was marching out on the feild today though. You can smell this distinct odor in the air.. right before it rains. Sounds sooo stupid but its true! im standing there and im like... god damn it smells like rain.. all of'a sudden it started raining on us! I was like :O hehehe tight! Everyone walked inside and we went to seperate rooms blah blah blah... After it stoped raining we went outside again and played almost through the first movement of the show while marching it. Marching.. and playing is fun.
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY!!!!!
Later when we all went inside... they gave away money for the people that sold the most bobcat cards... this one guys got fucking 170$. 170$!!!! JESUS CHRIST I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MY ASS OFF! That would have been soooooo fucking nice to have that money thats like... half of the way to a new computer... a much better computer than this PEICE OF ROYAL SHIT! Blasphemy.

I swear... there is something wrong with the pizzas i cook in the oven cause they keep trying to fold over into tacos... i mean i go and check on it and its like folding up AND ITS NOT EVEN DONE COOKING! Argh, stupid pizzas... stupid stupid stupid. Kinda funny though... i might sit there and watch the pizza do that nextime. ~_^

Leveld up almost all my guys on ff3 to 99... just a few more to go. Already leveld Locke, Jaymi, Mog, Setzer, Terra, and Cyan to level 99. They pimp. SLASH SLASH SLASH SLASH *dies* DA DA DA DAAA DUHHH LAAAAA DAAAADUHHDAAAAAAAAAAA. w00t w00t.

...ewwww CS for xbox... get it away russ GET IT AWAY!!!
AHHHH EVIL THING *holds up cross* Damn game wants my blood I swearz0r.

Is it just nobody talking to me... or has everyone suddenly become anti social right infront of my eyes. Its rather disturbing. I think the bordem has gotten to everyone. Why bordem.. why... *falls down and screams into the sky* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!1

OH ONE MORE THING! IF U WANT A BOBCAT CARD TALK TO ME NOW!!! >.< The sales end on THIS FRIDAY! THIS!!! FRIDAY!!! You want one talk to me. :P

IM DONE~! ^_^

HEY GUYS LETS GO DO SOMETHING... but nooo... we want to sit here and play games all day like lil indoor kikes :B ... RAR. Blasphemy... The only time i went out and did something was with the da kids... which is always cool.

Oh god... when school starts up im not going to be able to do ANYTHING during the week (sept on mondays) Bloody band everynight from 6-9... well... aside from the weekend and mondays that is. Nah i take that back... theres some saturday football games we have to play at. The first football game this year is acually on a saturday... LAME. Cool part is they might get us charter bus's to go down to victoria sense its so damn far away. Last time we were on charter bus's we played cards the whole time. Hehehe... one of my friends put up a 20 cause he thought he had this really nice hand. Bryan like... took that right away from him and garret was like :O AHHHHHHHHHH. It was great. I made like a dollar in change... i suckz0r at cards. Maybe its just my luke. Acually.. ya its just my luck but oh well cant do shit bout that. WHAT IF I LIKE FRIDAY THE 13th HUH?! AND I LIKE BLACK KITTIES IS THAT A CRIME?! Occasionally i break a mirror or 2 and walk underladders but whos gunna do anythin bout it?
BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I tried to post this adopt-a-chocobo thingy on my journal.. but sense u can't edit HTML directly (or atleast i dont know how u can) It kept saying STOP STEALING FROM OUR SITE!!!!! so i kinda did away with that rather quickly. 

Acually went swimmin the other day... was out there for about 3 hours burstin' across the pool. It was fun even though i almost colapsed from exahsiton... Well more or less the not getting enough air part. Mehhhh

*ramble ramble ramble*

Band pool party last firday... went and stood around with some of my friends. like 40 ppl in half of a closed off pool... It was closed off so that on the other half ppl could jump off the diving board. Everyone was just kinda standing in the pool talking. Snore... They did uhhh... what they ussually do to freshmen. Got out a slip-n-slide ... had the freshmen go down it as the seniors sprayed them with whiped cream and chocolate. Hahaha... it wasn't very entertaining but the seniors seemed to enjoy it.

Aight. Im done.

Yestarday was coo. Had some friends over fer a nerd parteh (ex. Gameing out the mo) Anywayz, Andrew, Phillip, Jason, and Jarred came. It was quite fun, like the last time sept uhhh... later in the night when i almost threw up my fucking stomach hurt SO BAD. Omg... 2 fregin hours of extreme painful'ness laying on my bed tossing and turning screaming bloody murder. ARG! Ok, pre-warning to all people'z. NEVER eat 4 taco bell soft tacos within 2 minutes. It doesn't go well with your stomach at all. ... ... ... movin' on.
We played worms... a lil' Halo, and I played Diablo one fer da ps1 on a ddr pad! God that games so fun when you play like that. ^_^ We ran through the last mission on Halo (The maw) on hard and legendary. Really wasnt that hard... dont know what these people are talking about with their Legendary hateing bullshit.
Let's see... Got a page done of my story. It seems to be comin along pretty well, the whole plot of the story is still in the process of being tweeked. Should turn out pretty nice though, 'specially if I really get into writeing it. :D

Even while im doing somthing... my attention span dies and i just start thinking about something comepletly different... most of the time. Ill like, be sitting there playing gunbound or something... or talking to my friends and ill just blank out and start thinkin about like... the first day of school or what new movies are out... Shesh. See.. this is what i spent doing today. PONDERING THIS EXACT STUFF. -.- Its bothering me cause the day just goes right on by... i loose track of time when im just compeltly zoned out. Gar... what is wrong with meh.

On a lighter note, i started writing a story... I have NO idea what its about though. Just kinda makin it up as i go along, seems like the best way to write to me. You can always change something that you wrote earlier and its alot easier to change the whole story if u dont already have the damn'd thing completly planned out from the start. I think ill revolve it around dragoons... just because any kind of dragoon is cool. Enough of this, i shall continue writing. *bows* B'bye

We watched this ""hedwig"" movie... Omg scared the shit outa me. Creepyst damn'd movie i have EVER seen. It was like... *eye twitch* about every 5 seconds. WOW it was a severly messed up movie. Whoever made that... is just... not right i swear. You cant make a movie like that without being uhh. Strange. Oddly strange. REALLY STRANGE. CREEPY ASS MOFO STRANGE. Either way... the movie was umm.. interesting? I dont know how to put it cause its just... wow. See it at your own risk. 

All in all it was quite fun. We watched a bunch of flash videos (including arfen house twice.. hehe alright) Wow when the ppl started playing ddr i was like :O ive never really seen ppl play ddr sept at like... fregin... Arcade places. Montasia those kindsa places, cant really think of what they are called right now sooo i shall refer to them as cheep-game-ripoff-expensive-fun stores! Ya sounds about right. Wait where am i going rambling on like this totally off subject O.o Back to da ddr at the party. It was fun watching 1 person play on heay mode and the others on like light.. one person jumpin round like a loon and the other one would always get to take their time just kidna pressin with the beat. All in all id have to sayyy that Hilary literally Owned everyones ass anddd thats about it. Haha.. damn good thing i didnt play i would have fallen flat on my ass! ^_^ Haha... victory me! Me motha picked me up at 10 somthin... alot of ppl had left by then. It was sad seein everyone leave, it didnt seem like it was 5 hours. It felt like bloody 2! Either way... fun fun in a bunch! Whateva thats suppose ta mean.. it just sounded good to say at the time. *shrug*

Got home and went straight on gunbound where, like it ussually does, crashes like every 7 games. Bloody hell i hate that... YA YA IM GUNNA OWN U WITH FULL LIFE YA YA *crash* ... ... ... GODDDD DAMNITTTTTTTT!!!!!! >.<

Blasphemy... it seems that whenever i want my alarm clock to go off... IT DOESNT and when i want it to... it just kidna sits there and snickers at my misfortune. I will one day catch it in the act... and thats the day ill have a hammer in my room >:) Maybe ill throw it into an acid bath i dunno. Either way dat alarm clock is goin deeeeown.

It was bad enough missing the movie but not being able to hang out with da kids angers me. Im always happy person when im around them... oh well. Time fer teh Grumpsters ta finish up dis journal.

Still it was pretty funny lookin at the freshmen, 'specially cause they are short... like I'd have to say about on average... 5' 1""? Either way they are pretty short.

It was fine so he puts it back in and i start the computer up again. YAY IT WORKED! I was like, ""WOO"" He was like ""yaaaaa..."" Anywayz, eventually the computer starts up and im on windows and like, it's not jerky anymore! Then hes like, ""Ok, open CS and see if it runs any better"" So like, I open CS and the computer restarts. .... I mean, last time I checked, the CS button wasn't the restart button. Anywayz, he leaves and then im sitting here on the comp... its runnin better I'm like ""YAY"" but it just freezes all the time for no apparent reason! Just out of no where poof.... T_T Either way, Sean is going to fix it today or tommorow so it's all goooooood I guess. He's going to sell me a nice video card too for 30$! AHAHAHAHAH... my comp is are getting upgraded finnaly... I'm totally amazed. What also amazes me is that I'm able to write this journal without the comp restarting which is kinda weird but eh. :D

"event","Today... totally fregin OWNED!!! AHAHAHA!!! I finnally did something, althought it wasss band. Either way i got to see alot of my friends again so eh. Had to wake up at 8, and be there by 845. We marched in the sun forrrr 3 hours i think.. till 11. Ate lunch man... ate lunch. Ohhh... lookin at my arms right now, IM SUNBURNED! YAAAAY! Being away from this treachorus room is soooo nice, even if you have to march in the sun for 3 hours, which may i add really isn't that bad. Kinda funny though today, alot of the new freshman were wearing jeans, I dunno i find that funny when alot of people are complaining of the heat while wearing like shorts and a sleevless shirt. Haha... lil boogers got another thing comin. I bet none of them gunna be wearing jeans tommorow. Meh, heats really not that bad. Last year i wore all black one day... black jeans, shirt (with a green overshirt) andddd i was fine soooo people need to stop complainin. Its so stupid, learn to cope with stuff ya fools. Not everything is going to be peachy clean perfect woo hoo hoo... so just ya know... live/deal/cope with it. Eh, back to band. After we were done eating tubas/euph's had to get all the chairs out and take them down the main hallway to the 3000's. What fun that was... racein down on chairs, slidding them into eachother. Meh, it was pretty coo. Our euph teacher is some guy from goodson, hes coo. Not really much to say about the rest of the band day sept we sat there and learned how to play some music... intersting right? Ha ha...yaaaaa.....

Now that I am home though, all is well! We stopped at Locatelli's and picked up 2 large pizza's. OMG THEIR PIZZA IS DA SHIZZZ MAINE! Mmm... I can still taste it in my mouth... :D :D :D God get that shit with extra cheese... they like glob the cheese on there. Its some great stuff, go try it sometime it's down by the McDonalds right down the streetttt... my... street. I really need to learn the names of roads, but I do know its at the intersection of Louetta and Grant... now im not even sure of that. Wait yes I am... meh, I'll go find out later *shrug*

Sister bought that new Yellowcard cd, it's pretty nice. Good band I'd have to say. We were lookin at laptops earlier... omg like, the shitiest lap top is better then this thing. Anger... ANGER! My parents are all like... maybe if u get some of your shit off of that computer it will run better. Or ya know.... maybe it was never good in the first place *sigh* they don't even know how to turn a comp on and they are lecturing me on if something is good or bad. I don't get it.

Hehe, I think i have rambled on enough for now, I shall part now. Laterz.

I shall end with this note: Learn your friends Veit names so when their lil brothers that only speak Viet come in lookin fer them, ya know who they are. *Nods*"

Just go out and do something... but noooo... almost all my friends are fregin gamers that ENJOY SITTING HERE DOING THE SAME THING. Bloody hell. The only people that would infact go out and do something are away on trips! I can't beilive this, well acaully yes I can but that's not the point right now. *sigh* Oh fregidy well. No matter.

I was lookin up online games today and came across this one called MU Online. It looks pretty tight, it's an MMORPG.... (Massivly Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) It's alot like Diablo II, but 1) It looks alot better 2) Gameplay is alot smoother and 3) Everyone plays at the same time in the same world so like... not only 8 people at a time. Eh, it's sexyyy uh huh... very sexyyy... check it out http://www.muonline.com

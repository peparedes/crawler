luke, a guy i dated in first yera, just got out of a two year relationship, and now wants me to teach him how to casually date, cause, well i guess that is what i am known for, its what i did with him hahahaha.  so the lessons are starting this week.

and a guy i knew in high school goes to mcmaster now, so we hung out some too, its weird hanging out with people you havent hung out with in years, cause although a lot of time has passed, some things never change. 

rachel i watched the series finale of alias and holy crap, if you dont have it i will send it to you somehow, cause its freaking amazing, you will die.

ok i am going to go sit on my balcony, sunbathe and read.  later peeps."

ok, I cant be asked to keep typing.  i reckon i will again soon though just out of pure boredom.

oh hung out with ian, and he is such a fricking moron.  what did i ever see in him?!?!?!?!  i tried talking to him but there is just nothing there.  he wanted me to call him, i said I would, but i am defs not going to.  what a twat."

so p.s. I am completely head over heels for - wait for it - my boyfriend.  so weird to even type.  he is the nicest boy that I have ever known I think, he texted me before my exam today to tell me good luck, called me right after to see how it went, and then called me again a few hours later to tell me that he missed me.  and I am making myself puke right now, but I love it.  he told me that last night he fell asleep with no blankets and pressed against the wall, cause that is how he has been sleeping whenever I am around (how can anyone like a bed and blanket hog like me?).

and he told me that after my exam tomorrow, as soon as I get to his place (which was going to be right after my exam, but as its always chicks before dicks, it will now be after i go with rachel to help pick out a lip ring for her) he has surprises for me, and he told me he was going to treat me like a princess all weekend.  no one has ever said that before!  I dont even know what its like to be treated like a princess.  I bet its really good though.  I dont even care about this freaking exam tomorrow, I just want to go see him.  now. now. now. I think I have discovered the best boy ever."

"event","fuck I hate exams.  and essays.  I hate school in fact!  its bloody hard to be at school this long, I am usually done by mid april, and here I get another freaking month and a half of it!

so yesterday was the first day of my not drinking ONE drink until saturday night.  There are two reasons I want to do this.  One - because I have two exams on friday and saturday.  Two - because a boy just ended dating me because I drink too much.  And three - because I think maybe I do drink too much.  I was drunk on monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday and friday.  eep.  even sam and rachel are calming down, so its definately my turn to as well.

nothing else is news really, I am starting to get really freaking sad about the prospect of having to leave england.  I am just not prepared for it.  Its not even exciting really.  When I was coming here, it was such a big deal!  months of countdowns, now I hate admitting out loud the day of my flight.  and it isnt because I dont want to go home - I really cannot wait to see everyone, especially my two sisters because they have been my best friends this year, total dedication.  I miss them the most I think.  I think its just because I have grown so freaking attached to everyone and everything here.  I like my stinking little bowland room, and my dirty ass kitchen.  I like having a place to go every night, I like having a bar right in my residence.  I like living across from rachel.  I like sam coming over for tea every morning waking me up.  I have gotten so much in a routine here, I find it difficult to imagine being happy anywhere else.  I wonder if I could ever be as happy as I am here.  and then there is that huge fear, that maybe I will never come back.  that these friends that I have grown to treasure here will move on, that I will move on too, that they will just turn into anecdotes I say when people ask me about england, and never be anything more.  and my biggest fear is going back to a place that is saturated in memories of jana, whereas here, I am safe from that.  one world I am scared of forgetting, and one world that I wish I could forget.  this is not going to be an easy adjustment."

so I am going to hull tomorrow morning, and even though I know that its going to be a blast, what it actually means even more is the fact that my dad is here in 4 days!  4 sleeps and I get to see my dad!  there is nothing more exciting than this.  I am so happy this time is actually here.  I get hull, then I get my dad and then I get jen!!  I am so excited that this is all actually happening!

on another note, I wrote two short stories in the last two days, its actually pretty good for me, seeing as how I was in a writing block mode for the last couple of weeks.  They are still rough, but I am happy with the ideas of them, I just need to make them maybe a little longer, and make the flow a little better.  But overall, I am pretty happy with them, and cant wait to read them out in class, creative writing is an attention whore like me's dream."

so I have again, done not much today, I am loving the life of laying around and doing nothing, its a bad habit that I am going to get stuck into soon, I know it.  but thats ok, I feel I deserve this break.  well I dont, but I am pretending I do.  I got my train tickets today, so I am definately going to hull on friday.  it will be cool to go chill in hull, and sykes said he is staying at smiths too, so it is sure to be tons of fun.  I am actually pretty excited about it really.

Am I the only one who thinks the press coverage of the popes death is going way overboard.  I now know his life story just because I watch the news, is that really necessary?  an 84 year old man died, not really the most shocking thing that has ever happened this week, let alone ever.  ooh manah, writing that is another reason why I am destined for hell I think.

nothing new in the lancaster area, and that could be because, well lets face it, my life is on hiatus until friday when it starts rocking all over again.  must get more work done before then.  how am I not even started on my history paper?  is that even possible?  I suck man."

If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan.
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand.
I move on to another day,
to a whole new town with a whole new way.
Went to the porch to have a thought.
Got to the door and again, I couldn't stop.
You don't know where and you don't know when.
But you still got your words and you got your friends.
Walk along to another day.
Work a little harder, work another way.

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan.
We'll float on maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on maybe would you understand?
Well float on maybe would you understand?

The days get shorter and the nights get cold.
I like the autumn but this place is getting old.
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast.
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most.
The days get longer and the nights smell green.
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave.

I like songs about drifters - books about the same.
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane.
Walked on off to another spot.
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want.
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights.
Adding their breeze to the summer nights.
Outside, water like air was great.
I didn't know what I had that day.
Walk a little farther to another plan.
You said that you did, but you didn't understand.

I know that starting over is not what life's about.
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth.
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth.
My thoughts were so loud."

Tonight I am going to try and get some more philosophy done.  hopefully I can highlight, summarize, and then type up all the summaries by the end of this vacation.  That and read shit loads of novels.  oh and write a history essay.  and do some creative writing.  so it turns out that I DO have tons to do, and instead I am just spending days watching alias and drinking wine hahahaha.  I am freaking useless.

so now that I know that I have shitloads and shitloads to do, I am going to get to it right now.  Tonight its philosophy and finishing the country wife.  and if I finish that in time, start another book-o."

but yeah it was loads of fun, and my first ever vacay that involved purely chillaxation (a new word, I love it).  now though I am back in lancaster and pretty freaking bored.  sam is leaving for paris on friday I think, if not earlier.  hassan went back to pakistan today.  nik leaves for roma tomorrow.  and that leaves me all by my freaking little self.  and it wouldnt be so bad if I had, lets say, the internet or a tv in my room, but I dont, so I have resorted to walking to towns, and if you know me, you know that I must be pretty freaking bored to resort to physical activity.  I am contemplating just hibernating for the next 13 days.  ooh, 13 days till I see my papa.  I cannot wait, I am going to email him with a list of the goodies that I want.  mmmm...canadian ketchup, soon you will be mine.

well that is about all i have to say.  I have a new crush named ben, but he is back home in birminham right now, so that is that.  and I dont plan on pulling anyone for a while, firstly because there is no one around to pull, and secondly because soon I will be with my dad, and dont want that to happen around him, no matter how pissed I am."

he called me thursday night, at the most perfect time, and asked me what I wanted from london, at which I said the shoes and killers t-shirt was what I wanted.  he said he meant something else, so I told him to get something that reminds him of me in camden.  sigh.  he makes me so giddy!  and last night he called me babe on msn.  woooo.  I am so gay.  but I cant help it.  I really cannot wait for him to get back.

enough about that.  I am getting pretty close to charlie, which is cool, I really like her.  its too bad it took so long for me to actually realize this.

thursday night was fun, dave the ginger was there, and rose brought him up to me (evil plan so that she could eat fries!) and yeah I pulled him.  he came back with me and we hung out with zoe and graeme (they live on my corridor and are friends with him).  that was good.  

friday I walked into town and just hung out, which was fun.  that night, ali rachels twin came to visit, and we drank, which was also good.

last night we went to the lounge and revolution, that was fun, but the best part was after.  me alex and mike hung out drinking, alex left at like 4 and then mike and I drank until 9.  I have only slept like 3 hours, I am so tired, but if I go to bed now, I will wake up in the middle of the night with nothing at all to do.  I might actually start becoming completely noctornal just so I can start getting work done.  hmmmm.  will try that tonight.  go to class tomorrow and then sleep all day, wake up at like 10 and work all night.

people keep telling me I am acting weird, which is just freaking me out and making me act even weirder I think.  I dont know, I am confused on how I am supposed to act, and I feel bad because no one wants to talk to me about it because they think it has to do with jana.  but I dont think it does.

ooh did I say that I was talking to Jenny and she said that dave dickson like me and the only word he could use to describe it was smitten, that has made me turn into a little girl, everytime I think about him I cant help but blush and giggle.  he also told jen that he would be spending a lot of time at our apartment in hamilton next year for me (since me and jen are going to live together)  ahhhh!  I am blushing even as I type this!"

alex and I had to walk home cause we were hanging with drunken dicks but oh well, that is what happens to some people when they drink I suppose, and alex doesnt even remember the walk so I can let it go.

umm, what else.  going out tonight which is wicked.  with rose, her boyfriend adam and all his friends, should be good times man, and I prolly wont have to walk home tonight, so thats ace.

ok, thats it, for all those reading dont be dicks when you are drunk cause it is just annoying!  and you will get your karmic payback one day *shakes fist*"

its valentines day.  and I got in a fight with ian last night and called him a dick.  he totally deserved it though, so I think things might actually be over, cause I dont plan on talking to him until at least he apologizes.

aside from that I had an amazing weekend, the rock star party was fantabulous, and there are pictures so check out my photo site.  it was a great time.

today me, sam and rachel are going out to get pissed, because well we are anti valentines day, so that should be good times.

so today will be the first (of many I am sure) tests for my non pulling decision, I always pull at the sugar house!  but tonight, I wont.  In fact, looking back, I dont think I can remember a time when I havent pulled there.  ooooooh, this WILL be hard!  but I have to win!

watched desperate housewives last night, such a good show!  then we watched true lies which could very well be the worst movie of all time.  its definately up there.

"event","oh my goodness, I had the best night last night.  what started off as a pint at the bar ended up as an all night party, and hanging with such cool new people.  I hung out with julia and tim on sunday night, and then again last night, and they are just really awesome, I totally love hanging with them.  it was just refreshing to be in a different group, with a different dynamic, and no mention of firestorm college, and all the members.

ibad came by too, which was nice, although warren was being a dick to him, but whateves, that is just what he is like I suppose.  I have decided to give up being his friend for lent (as in I will never talk to him, only talk if he is directly talking to me) cause he is such an ass, to me, sam, rach, rose, julia, nikol, basically every girl we hang with.  I think its the short man syndrome, he is over compensating for his lack of height.  oh and I am also giving up random pulling for lent.  not really for lent, but me, sam, rose, rachel and julia are having a competition.  we each give up something we love but isnt good for us, and the person who lasts the longest wins, while the person who goes out first has to get the winner pissed drunk!  yeah, I will probably lose, but here is hoping!

anyways, yeah it was a super fun night, and I am glad it all happened.  thursday and friday are going to be fun too - sugar house and then the rock star party.  I need to go get some cyndi lauper clothes though, cause that is who I am dressing up as."

I am so embarrassed that an 18 year old figured me out.  does it get much worse than that?  I need to end this crush, and fast too, its no good at all.

we all drank last night which was good, but warren was trying to get me to pull him again, but I didnt!! yeah!!!

and ibad called me at like 4am to tell me he was drunk and wanted me to come over or for him to come over here.  great, now I am getting booty calls, but not even real ones cause he cant have sex because of his religion.  I told him no, it was partial disgust with the booty call itself and - lets face it - partially out of laziness"

and I pulled ibad again, which again bad idea, I am trying to avoid boy trouble here, and I am just putting myself into it over and over again.

well other then the news that I am such a dick when pissed, there is nothing else really new.  

I am frigging starving, I cant wait for my fish fingers to be done, in like 10 more minutes.....mmmmm......

I woke up still drunk today.  I actually bought myself a box of wine last night, and like half of it is gone.  eep.  I am a total alcoholic.  

tomorrow I want to read my creative writing stuff, perhaps write some more, and read some philosophy.  those are the goals.  and if at all possible, begin thinking about what to do my from renaissance to restoration essay so I can ask some questions.  oh, and must go to the library for books.  oh and read for my romanticism.  ok, must do all those things.

I really have nothing to say though.  my creative writing class was awesome, they really liked my story which I was so proud of, it was really cool and filled me with tons of confidence.

I also picked up a philosophy class, so I am going to be super busy this term man, and I already feel behind in so many things.  I think I will use today to catch up.  on two classes - philosophy and from renaissance to restoration.  that is a fine goal I think, oh and must pick up essay topics for romanticism.  so much to do!

as soon as I am actually caught up though I will feel soooo much better, it will be awesome.

I think I am over my crush on rob totally, I hung out with them all last night, and yeah I still see him as attractive, but I can totally tell he isnt my type at all, so yeah, the crush seems to be finito.  which means i have no current crushes right now, and perhaps, I can have a boy-drama free couple of weeks.  I think after the whole escapade with dave at his place, things are over with him too.  so yeah lets cross our fingers for a total escape of boy drama for at least a little while, cause I am totally over it."

I ran into jeremey, the guy who goes to mcmaster, finally last night.  we have both been here since september, and I havent seen him at all.  owen was with him too visitng from leeds, which was awesome!  I didnt really hang out with them at all last year, it was mostly first year in which we were close, but it was still nice to see them.  jeremey kept trying to kiss me, and kept bringing up the fact that we danced in first year and I made out with him in second year.  both things I felt the shame for, but whatever.  I think we are going to hang out later.   he did seem like an ass last night to rach and nik, but he was drunk.  he usually isnt that assy, at least from what I remember of hanging out with him before.

and it was so nice to be called murph again!  as much as I hated that name soooo much it reminds me of the boys from first year, and how much fun I used to have.

dave the ginger was in my kitchen last night before we left for the bar.  i wanted so much to make out with him, but there were people around.  and plus I dont want to have a crush on him, that would just further complicate my life, he should just stay at the sugar house and thats it.

I havent seen rob since thursday, and even then i didnt really talk to him.  so maybe the crush will go away, and the next time i see him, i wont even give a crap about him.  ok, probably not, but a girl can hope, right?"

I was doing so good in avoiding him, but oh well.  I stayed over at his place, although nothing happened, we were both way too drunk to even try to do anything.  He drove me back today, and again, I said goodbye like I always do to him, its the most casual thing ever, still dont have his number, dont even know his last name.  Its hilarious how little I know about him, except that I pull him, and I know he is cute!

I didn't talk to rob at all last night, maybe I am getting over that crush.  its about time considering he is an 18 year old boy.  like I am way too old for him.

dammit!  why do I get crushes?  oh well, at least I know I dont really freak out about dave, its really an i-only-think-about-him-when-i-see-him thing.  and he is so fun to pull.  and such a good kisser, which is an improvement from mike from manchester, the worst kisser ever I think.  k, thats enough details I think for you all, although there arent many more, but I will shut up!

I am absolutely terrified.  we have to give a copy to everyone in our class (like 11 people!) and then read it out in front of them!  and even worse, we have to listen to them critique it!  eeep!

I have a date today with the boy that I met in prague who is from manchester, he is on his way here as I type!  how cute is that?  I am excited and nervous all in one.  I will just have to wow him with my amazing personality.  we all know I am the coolest cat around!

I met two girls from australia in prague (the night of my last entry) they are awesome.  they live in england so I am going to go visit them soon I think.  hahah, they let me try speed with them as well as an e and I was so stoned I didnt sleep for like 3 days.

then to glasgow for my birthday where I picked up a hottie that I refer to as ""white shirt"", turns out his name is scott.  nikol is here from mac, she is awesome to hang with, she picked up a professor who I love to refer to as ""old man river"". 

we then went to edinburgh for new years, which is internationally known for the street party there. we even saw scissor sisters (such a good band) and BLONDIE live!  with the gross scab I didnt really pick up as it probably looks like scurby or something.

we are now in prague.  some french girl is convinced that the scab is a cocaine addiction thing, which I think is much more glamourous so that is what I am now referring to it as.  hahaha, its hilarious that I seriously have not one clue on what it is.  its right under my nose too, so it probably looks like a nasty cold sore or something.

tomorrow we are heading to krakow.  then warsaw, berlin and amsterdam.  I though am looking forward to getting back to uni and settling in.

one final story - new years eve in edinburgh we had nowhere to stay, we were sitting on the street corner waiting for the train station to open at 7.  I was in the fetal position almost crying cause I was so cold.  a guy came up to me and gave me the scarf on his neck.  he then invited me back to his place with my friends for tea and a place to stay.  I was hesitent but he introduced me to his bpyfriend.  WICKED!  no sketchiness!  so they took all SEVEN of us back to their apartment and made us tea gave us blankets and pillows and woke us up for the train.  I love humanity.  he has given me enormous faith in peeople, and I just think that story is uplifting so I should spread it."

I will go on about it later, but the stupid thing is that after this 4 day haze of just being in a frigging good mood, I got 2 texts from adam, the first saying hey, and the second saying ""so we arent talking now?  we should have a chat when we get back""  I texted him back saying is was a moron, and that I was away and didnt even have my mobile on me, and he kept texting and texting.  blah blah blah.  I dont even think he knows what I know, but I dont care.  I really dont give two shits about him, he is a fun person to hang out with, but thats it.  oi!  drama drama drama.  and that is the last thing I want after how dramatic the last month was.  boy drama just seems frigging idiotic to me now, like not even worth my breath!  

i have decided that for the new year, I am just going to not talk to anyone whose company I dont enjoy.  why put myself through that?  I hate fake alex, and this year she is going to die!!  yeah!

although it was a fun night, it ended with me thinking about her.  its been that way for the last week or two.  i think its just cause I feel like I dont have that many close friends here, and so I am lonely.  eep.

anyways, happy happy christmas to you all!"

"event","oh dear god.  so jenny (my other best friend) just admitted herself into a psychiatric hospital because she was contemplating suicide so much.  I cant deal with all of this, and all within a month.  why is it me that has all the depressed friends?  my sisters will be my best friends from now on, at least they are forever.

other than that, things are fine here.  christina is here, she is awesome, a total lot of fun.  I got my email back from dave dickson, yeah!  he is so cute.  he is studying for exams on chemical thermodynamics, and statistical calculus, thank god I got out of science, I could NOT deal with that crap.

to everyone that reads this, if any of you decided you are leaving me too, I will hunt you down and get you first!  *shakes fist* everything must be good from now on, I need a stress free month or two, that is for sure. 

hahaha, I got a text from adam saying he was sorry if he was a dick and happy christmas, I just lauged and was like no worries, see ya.  I told laura the whole story about everything stupid he said to me, at first I felt bad, but then I figured its my freaking story to tell, he cant get mad, cause it happened.  and its not him that is the ass, he wasnt really ever my friend."

"event","that subject line is from a show called little britain.  its hilarious.  the last two nights have been a lot of fun.  friday night sam and I got drunk, then richard, francis and I went to the sugar house, and got drunk there.  came back and made drunken phone calls with sam.  then passed out.  francis called at like 4 to talk, so we talked for like an hour, then matty called and we talked for just as long.  I love when people call me drunk.

last night laura came over from cartmel, her sam and I drank, sat around and bitched, told hilarious, embarrassing, mean, and every other kind of story.  I love having girls to bitch to, that is the greatest part about girl friends.

thats about it.  sam and I are SO lazy during the day its hilarious, I think we are having christmas dinner at cartmel with laura tonight.  then visiting francis in liverpool and matty in huddersfield.  should be good times."

"event","ahhh, I am turning into an absolute miserable git this week.  every time anyone here has something stupid to complain about I feel like punching them in the face and screaming that they dont know what hard is.  and then giving them an indian sunburn or something equally obnoxiously painful.

I have a feeling I am going to have a blow out at someone soon, but I am trying to bottle it.  its hard to do though, and the more I bottle it, the harder it is to keep it in.  its just stupid to me, all the retarded things that people are frustrated with, and I know its normal, that used to be for me, but after all this, its just gay.  when nikol comes it will be cool cause I can vent to her about stuff."

"event","am feeling quite useless this week.  unmotivated too.  I kinda just want to hibernate for a month or so, I cant be asked to do anything.

I did go out last night, actually left the college.  that was a lot of fun.  sam is the funniest person I know in the world, and I love introducing her to the people I know cause I know they will like her too.  mike is just awesome, he is one of the few who gets me, and who treats me normally all the time, and I really respect that in him.  rachel and rose are just my awesomeness.  no words, I would be miserable if they werent with me.

I cleaned my room today which was good.  and I havent cried since like friday which is also awesome.  although the lack of sleep is still there, I actually cant sleep before like 7.  I am starting to see things.  

my mindset is good though, no really negative thoughts, just a total not caring.  I just dont really give a shit about anything right now, and that is what is getting me through."

"event","it is good to be back.  last night was weird, and it ended well, but for a while I didnt think it would be that good.  I do love the feeling of being missed though.  and I love that sam can tell when I need to talk, I need someone who can tell that without me saying it.

I am just kind of going through the motions right now, but that seems to be working.

adam keeps randomly texting me, he is really weird.  I have decided to ignore it.  well I will talk to rose about it probably cause she listens to that stuff like jana used to.  never getting sick of it.  I miss that.

dave dickson told jen that he wants my number here in england.  I pulled him when I went to kingston with jenny, did I forget to mention that?  so now on top of cheating on ian, IN CANADA (so no excuses this time) now the guy actually likes me, and I kinda like him too.

my life is a mess right now.

and again, the insomnia commences.  I slept only an hour last night, and it looks like its going to be that way again tonight."

"event","Ok,today was a Manderific Dat cause I got to see Mandy! But I will get to that soon. Let me start with yesterday since I seem to have missed making an entry yesterday.

YESTERDAY-Monday, March 22nd, 2004

Well yesterday was ok. I got to see Beckey. That was fun. I finally, actually met Lindsey Goodness instead of just talking to her online. I was dismissed at 1030 a.m. for an orthodontist appointment. My aunt couldnt pick me up so I called my uncle. He picked me up, drove me over there and then when we got there the lady said that they had to postpone my appointment until next Monday cause everyone else went to Florida. So I went back and kinda, accidently, not really, forgot to check in with the attendance office. So since I had A period lunch I skipped that and checked in after all the lunches were over so I got to go to four lunches. I saw Malea at 3rd lunch, and then went and walked around the school with Nikki and Lindsey. That was about as exciting the day got. After school I saw Beckey which was good becasue I had not seen her since Saturday and it was getting depressing.

TODAY-Monday, March 23rd, 2004

Today was a Manderific Day! Bobby and I decided to skip first period, so we walked to Phils, then to Healys, and then we walked through the graveyard and decided what we wanted to be when we were dead. (I am going to have a big ass tomb like the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet). The rest of the day was boring. After school I went over to Josh's house with Chris and James and we played with bottles, and rocks and the pond behind Josh's house-fun stuff. After that I went back to school and my Math teacher sees me. She is the class that I skipped today so she goes ""where were you?"" I go ""umm....I was late....I hate a ortho..dontist appointment"" she asks what his name was cause she never noticed that I had braces and since I couldnt remember I go ""umm...Phil...Healy""(yes bobby I stole your idea). Phil being from where we went to breakfast and Healy is because we went to Healys afterwards(for all you slow peoples out there). So then I got on the bus, saw Beckey and MANDY-YAY!. Since I watched Queer Eye the other day I am going to use there saying...""snaps"" for seeing Mandy!. Well taht made my day. And now I smell like all Vanillaish because Beckey had vanilla stuff on today. Then I got home, and called Beckey then decided I wasnt talking to her because she wasnt talking to me so she called Mandy and Mandy wasnt talking to her cause Beckey called her a slut so Mandy and I talked then Beckey left so Mandy and I couldnt talk anymore, o yeah and Beckey too-(tear). SO now I am doing this, taking a quiz, talking to Mandy, Malea, Monnie, and deciding what color tie and shirt for Thursdays Job Shadowship for IT academy. Ill add a quiz in here later on.
BECKEY even though I am not speaking to you, love you lots. 143/831 AnF. Love you babe.

"event","Ok, so I came back home from my Aunts house today around 2ish. I got home, and went online to talk to my Becks. Then I was angry cause her dad told her she couldnt go to the movies last night, so that is why I was at my aunts. Then when Beckey got back to her house he told her she could go and then seh couldnt get ahold of me. So that sucked. So I came home and was depressed 
'cause I thought it was just going to be another boring day. But then Beckey asked me what I was doing tonight and I wasnt doing anything so she invited me over to her friend Graces. 

GRACES

    Well for starters, Beckey gave me the wrong address. She told me the house number was 41 except that was her friend Josh's house. The house she was at was house number 18. So I went to the wrong hosue. When I finally found her, her Grace and I walked to Healys. Beckey bought Whip Cream and we attacked each other with it. That was fun. Then we met up with Mandy, Candace, and Rachyl. We went back to Healys and they bought diapers and some other stuff, so we could wear them on our heads. After that we went back to Grace's house. We were standing around and then all of a sudden, Mandy Candace and Rachyl caked Beckey and I. I got the worst of it, but Beckey got it too. It was all over the floor, but that was fun. We had a good time playing with the cake. After that we got a ride up to Shaws. Grace Beckey and I went to Waldens so Beck could buy Grace a present. Then we saw the other three again with balloons. So Beckey went to go buy one, and I ended up giving Mandy money to buy another one. After that we went back to Shaws and bought stuff I dont remember what, but I said I would pay cause I am a good kind person like that ;-) After that we went to Burger King for some strange reason and then to CVS so I could buy Mandy condoms. Then we walked back to Graces in the rain. Beckey and I smell like puke cause thats how you smell after you have dry whip cream in your hair. Then we basically just sat around. Grace was reading her book in the kitchen, Candace got stoned, Rachyl sat away from us, and Mandy and Beckey sat and leaned on me. Candace scared the shit out of Grace's mom, then squirted us with water. Then I left at some point. I think 11, but I am not entirely sure. Now I go to bed. Good night. Love you lots Beckey. 143/831 AnF. I had so much fun tonight Beckey and I love you. Good night!

"event","Hey everyone. Once again it has been a long time since I last updated this thing. I don't quite remember when the last time I updated was but I'll do what I can to inform you what has happend. 

  This week was really good. I am not going to go over each and everyday. But it was a good week. I saw Beckey almost everyday. I stayed home from school today and hopefully Beckeys dad will let her go to the movies tonight so I can see her. The rest of you who are going to the Spring Out of Winter Ball, mainly Andraya and Brittney make sure you guys take pictures for me ok! Nothing really interesting this week happend. Yesterday Candace gave her self fake boobs, using balloons and when I told Kacie she believed me. Then Candace made her self a fake dick out of a balloon. That was interesting, except then someone popped her fake boobs. I got off the bus and my sweatshirt smells like Beckey and her's smells like me. Thats weird. I decided not to go to school today because it is cold out and I don't want to wait in the snow for the bus, and now I am waiting for Beckey to call me at three-ish,so she can inform me to whether or not her father is going to let her go or not. He better cause that wont be cool and I wont get to see her until Monday if he doesnt.

  Now I will put in some of these quizzes I took cause I am so bored.

"event","Alrighty then! So this weekend was fun. Friday night I didnt go to the rink like people try and make me do. So I stayed home and talked to Beckey and Nikki online. After Beckey left for the night I went to bed. Saturday was interesting.

SATURDAY
   Ok, so I woke up at 730am, and went online. A short while later Nikki and Beckey sign on and ask if I want to go with them to Narragansett Pier Middle School at 4 to a basketball game. So I asked my mom and she said she will take me but she couldnt pcik me up becasue she was going out. She said that I ahd to ask my Uncle or someone for a ride. Well, my great aunt lives right near the school but ehr and my grandmother are in NH for the weekend, so I said mom if I cant get ahold of anyone why dont I just go and stay at my aunts house and she can pick me up the next morning, she thought about it and said yeah. So she dropped me off at her house, I walked to Bess Eaton, and then to the school. I was waiting inside the lobbu for Beckey and Nikki, and then Nikki walks in and sees me and says to follow her cause they were already there. So I waited in the lobby for like 10minutes not knowing that Beckey was like 15feet away, except there was a wall there so yeah. So I went in, and then the three of us went outside, and Nikki got into a big fight with some kid because hes an asshole and is mad at her because he likes Beckey and Beckey doesnt like him she likes me so he got mad at Nikki cause hes stupid I guess. So went outside and Beckey and I walked around the school, and then came back and went abck into the gym with Nikki. So we cheered for the team that Ben wasnt on. By the way he runs really fucked up like-it was funny-so then Beckey had to leave at quarter of five so that was sad. I ran back to my Aunts house and went upstairs to watch tv. Then I called Beckey at 6 and we talked for a half hour then she went to eat. I called her back at 715 and then we talked for an hour then we called Petrina and talked till 10 and then we left. It was an interesting night. 
   Now its Sunday morning and I am updating this thing and now I am going.

"event","Ok, well naturally since I can never keep up with these fucking things I am behind. So I am not going to even go into the days that I have missed. I am just going to go on with today. And hopefully I will continue to update this thing everyday (dont expect it though, I actually have a hard time doing this). Anyways. Ill start off with the morning time. 

MORNING:
 Not much sleep. Went to bed at 430am and woke up at 530am. I had someone on my mind all night so I couldnt sleep. Woke up at 530 took a shower, ate something and got ready for school. Then left at 650am and went to school, o joy.

SCHOOL:
First Period was Band: This actually wasnt that bad. I didnt do to bad playing today. I didnt get into any trouble with Mr. Price. So it was actually a good band rehearsal today. I just dont understand why I have to learn the music because I am not going on the field trip to the music festival so its not like I have to play this music in a concert or anything. 

Second Period: Since we had double periods of B for three days it from A perido to C. Damn that sucked. I had Italian which actually wasnt bad. We played TOMBOLA, and listend to music and took a Vocab quiz, which I think I did alright on. So its not like that class was dreadful I jsut dont like being there.

Third Period: This was math. My favorite subject and all so nothing really to say for this class. We are learning about ratios and radicals and the pythagorean theorem(what fun).

Fourth Period: Biology. DAMN IT. I hate this fucking class so much. It is so fucking gay. I dont get any of it, and the dumbass teacher who teaches us like were kindergarteners and then gives us College Grade Tests wont give me any extra help. What a twat. Yeah so my average in that class is a 48. O BOY im doin so well in that class. That little cunt bitch. I hate new teachers.

Fifth Period: Well I skipped this one. I told Mrs. Mohan I was in Jazz Band and had to go set up for the assembly last period. Im not in Jazz Band, I am not good enough so I went down to the auditorium with friends and we made fun of people. That was fun.

Sixth Period: Got out of this for some Jazz assembly. Hey got me outta class so I cant complain.

AFTER SCHOOL
Eh... Same ol' same ol'. I stay after everyday so what can I say. I did the same thing I normally do. I walked around with friends, and got on the late bus.

LATE BUS
Eh... I was very tired. Not many little munchkins though. I was kinda aggrevated cause I couldnt sit with Becky. I ended up talking to Dan the whole time about the military adn knives. 

HOME
Ended up breaking up with Emma. Things werent working out. Its all for the better. I know it is. Plus I still really really am in LOVE with Beckey, the girl who I stupidly dumped for Emma. What the fuck was going through my head that say, I have no fucking idea. But I do know it was the biggest fuckup Ive ever made and I will never do taht again. I would be stupid to let someone who I really love go...twice. Becky I love you. And I am glad you still love me to. Because I would be lost without you.

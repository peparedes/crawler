Anyway, I heard when you first start fasting you won't lose weight for a while because your body will be clinging to all the fat because it's being starved. Is that true?"

If I was going to create an LJ that's a fucking dedication to some guy in an anime, I should've made it Hellsings' Alucard. But NOOO, I got a cute little Vash plushie at Ushicon, so I have to dedicate my fucking life to him. Hah. Just kidding. Mayeb one day I'll make a new LJ when I'm not feeling so lazy. FUCK I'm lazy. GOD DAMN. 

I love Richard. Richy richy rich. Down down he goes. Down into my belly. I don't know if you can tell, but I fucking loved that movie Anchorman, and Richard. 
""Brick, where did you get a hand grenade?""
""I DON'T KNOW.""
BWAHAHAH. I loved Stephen Correll. Everything he said made me have to pee, and I liked it. HEY! I got the best massage this morning. Why won't Richard get online? I'm a saaaad panda."

Things are going so great with Richard I could scream (sometimes I do). I want him to come with me to see Metallica in November in SA, but he's being fussy about it. WHATTA FUSSY BABY. 

I finally got to playing guitar, and I'm serious about it this time. I know the intro to THREE, count 'em THREE Metallica songs. And a couple chords, and that scale thing. I can't spell it. >< Richard's teaching me, and happiness is mine. I want to get better and save my money for a BC RIch Beast, because those are sexy.

Something was gonna happen. FUCK, I forgot. Oh yeah, I'm seeing Anchorman with Walter the brother tonight. Zounds!"

Or maybe I'm just a loser with nothing better to do than chronicle my insipid life on the internet, which will obviously never be read, but I like to keep a tiny glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that some, ridiculously bored stranger will happen upon it and think I'm clever or something, oh no a run-on sentence gotta stop gotta stop oh shit oh shit oh shit IT'S COMIN' RIGHT FOR US!!

Whoo. Sometimes I'm too honest with my self. 

Hey guess what, imaginary audience! I got with Richard. A long time ago, (72 days, to be precise) and I love him with all of my shriveled, little heart. I wann go over to his house again sometime. Hm. I miss him. Ho hum. GOD RICHARD, WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?!

I swear, I'd break up with that guy if I had someone else to hang out with. Not that he hangs out with me. GAH. He just walks me out door after lunch now, but it's cool because I get to walk by my future rape victim Richard. Doesn't matter what I say here because no one reads this, right? 

Okie poo. Enough of that. My mom got me a big thing of chocolates and a velvety heart shaped box. I drew her a picture. How cheap. -.- Zach got me a big stuffed bear, a little stuffed unicorn, and some chocolates, and various people throughout the day gave my candies. But, the thing about that stuffed bear and unicorn is, I hate unicorns, and that bear was fucking ugly. What the hell? And he BRAGGED about gettign them from WalMart, I swear, if he wasn't Mexican, I'd nag him for being cheap. 

K then. I guess that'll be the update for today. For anyone who reads this, I love you lots (unless you're Victoria Garza, Amanda Castanon, or those bitches Samantha and Jennifer, whose last names I don't know.

She has this stupid little book, Shakespeare for Dummies or some shit, but anyway, some mongoloid from the class will stumble through a line and Mrs. Perez, that dumb bitch, will translate it into ""normal English"".

Hey! I got an idea! I'll talk about my past weekend! Well, it should be evident from my name that I am, in fact, an anime geek kind of person. So, I went with some other anime geek kind of people up to good ol' Austin for the Ushicon convention. That was my first ""con"" and Jesus Christ, it was fun. People were dressed up as anime charries (I guess this is ""cosplay"" XD) and I got pictures of all the good ones. Three Vashes, six Wolfwoods, two Sephiroths and then some others. Those are my favourites anyhow. I met and got to talk to Vash's voice actor Johnny Yong Bosch in the J-Pop room, of all places. I took a piccie with him, got his autograph, and my Vash plushie got a kiss form him.

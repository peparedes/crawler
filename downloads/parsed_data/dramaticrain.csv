I will hand you my soul on a silver platter.

You scowl at the silver platter. It wasn't quite shiny.

My soul is battered and worn. Sorry it's not brand new.

You're a professional at evoking my emotions.

I apologize for attempting offering help.

I apologize for finding different solutions.

I apologize for not being confrontational.

You want to have someone to feel your pain.

I am that someone."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Harry Potter Review with Spoilers.""><em><u><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><strong>SNAPE&nbsp;KILLS&nbsp;DUMBLEDORE (I warned you)</strong></span></u></em><br />It's all the rage: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince! People are sitting outside dressed in Hogwarts/wizarding attire, waving their wands in the air and stupefying anyone who cuts in front of them. During opening night, the movie made 20 million dollars (is that right?). Yes, my friends! Harry Potter is the most popular wizard in the muggle world. <br /><br />As I sat down in my seat, I was excited for this movie. Though 20 minutes of previews started to thwart my excitement, I was nevertheless anxious to see what was done with one of my favorite books in the series. The first five minutes was displeasing. <br /><br />If memory serves me correctly, didn't Dumbledore meet Harry's Aunt and Uncle, causing quite a stir (this was like the Goblet of Fire to me...and the lack of the Weasley's at the Dursleys)? I was immediately confused. And the 20 some year old woman flirting with a 16 year old boy...who happens to be reading a newspaper not of that world? Curious. <br /><br />As I sat in the sweltering hot theatre, my dad snoring to my right, my sister whispering questions to my left (my other sister was busy texting), I wondered if this movie was going to be any good. I was already a bit annoyed, but Draco was coming up soon...and I heard much talk about him in this movie.<br /><br />As I suspected, Tom Felton made a brilliant performance as Draco Malfoy, the boy who must do an unforgivable spell or else he would be put to death by a certain dark lord. He started out as a cocky know-it-all who felt as though he had to seek revenge for his father's arrest. Harry Potter the chosen one? HA! Try Draco Malfoy bitches. As time progresses, he becomes less sure of himself, his face becoming paler and his eyes looking as though he was sleep deprived. He was torturing himself with this task...a task that should have been so simple for an experience death eater that was given to a boy of 16. Throughout the movie, you can see him becoming weak. Tom Felton portrays this torture perfectly, making me feel almost sorry for him.<br /><br />Rupert Grint, as usual, was hysterical. I would've liked to see him try and get the memory out of Slughorn, rather than Harry. I think he would've done a better job at acting incredibly lucky...Daniel Radcliffe acted more stoned than anything. Anyways, Ron was caught in a love triangle between Hermione Granger (Emma Watson is gorgeous...but she as a bit weak in this one) and Lavender Brown (Perfect casting). Though Ron obviously fancies Hermione, Lavender is more aggressive (way aggressive) and snogs our young Weasley, causing Hermione to become slightly emo. <br /><br />Speaking of relationships, I have to hone in on a particular one that was the most talked about during those days we were forced to live without this movie. Harry and Ginny. I won't go into specifics, seeing as though I have stuff to do and waves to surf, but their relationship was rather...bland. Ginny wasn't really a developed character, so Bonnie Wright's portrayal of her was a bit plain. In the books, she was this vibrant, confident character who seemed to have an outgoing personality; her mother's fierceness and her older twin brothers playfulness with a bit of Ron's humor. Yet in the movie, Bonnie seemed not to have grasped the character. It seemed to me that she was just reading her lines with a hint of emotion. The relationship on screen between Harry and Ginny made me quite uncomfortable. It was awkward (if that's what they were going for, they did one hell of a good job) which I figured it should have been. Harry's best friend's sister? That does cause for awkwardness...but in this case, there was no chemistry. To be able to feel the awkwardness and the uncontrollable chemistry between them would have changed the film entirely. Instead, it just made me want to leave the theatre and wonder why the hell Harry would go for Ginny.<br /><br />Dumbledore. An abrupt change in subject...but it had to be said. Michael Gambon was spectacular, as always and demonstrated to us how our loved headmaster was getting old&nbsp;(just like Dame Maggie Smith...oh man, love her). I was looking forward to him dying, merely because I was hoping for a fantastic piece of acting and lead up to his actual demise. Pretty much it was him trying to talk Draco out of it while Draco pointed a wand and hesitated. The Death Eaters were spectators and merely smirked at the dilemma (except for Bellatrix Lestrange...once again, Helena Boheme Carter is fabulous). There wasn't exactly a trail to his death...it just....it just kind of happened. I was hoping more out of it, wanting to see the struggle...and I didn't much feel Harry's anger and disappointment.<br /><br />The movie was great if you haven't read the book. If you have read the book, you'll be disappointed. The acting was mediocre and the plot was like Grandma's dress in the attic...filled with holes. And don't take someone who hasn't read the books, they'll be asking a ton of questions during the movie and after. Would I see this movie again? Yes, but only when it comes out in the cheap theatres... and&nbsp;I would perfect my game called &quot;Where the Hell is Neville,&quot; a game I made while trying not to get angry at the film for not featuring Neville. I think Neville should have his own show.<br />.</lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","We marched. We looked like dorks. But I don't think either of us cared.
We dated the same guy...not at the same time...but became closer because of it.
We crashed prom. It wasn't our prom. It wasn't even our alma mater. It was Langely's. 
We got locked out in the garage. Langely didn't want people having sex in hotel rooms.
We lied and said we just came back from a show...or a dance...we mixed them up.
Car stalking. We discovered Jackie Chan restauraunt and wrote the story about a woman in a honda. 
Baseball games. You hit on the pitchers. You got one number but refused to date him because his ERA&nbsp;was bad. 
You got hit with a sunflower seed by another pitcher. He paid you back with some gum.
You got married...only because there was a loophole in the system, and it was a good excuse to throw a party.
We donated blood together, just cause we wanted to meet Ryan Zimmerman who didn't show up. 
The last time I saw you, we went to a canceled baseball game, laughed at my awkward parking, went to a bar and discussed alcohol and then saw the Hangover.

There was never a dull moment when you were around. 
If you were there, something extrodinarily odd was going to happen. There was always a story to tell after. 

You were a unique person, Caitlin. You've touched a lot of lives, made a lot of friends. You're a real angel now and you don't have to deal with this shit that's going on here. I love you and I&nbsp;miss you."

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I can't put this eloquently, but I'll try.<br /> <br /> I thought that today would be a great day to lie out on my hammock and get some homework done. Perhaps it was the sky streaked with white or the warm air. The weather was oddly picturesque. With my laptop pressed against my chest, I stepped out into the open air, dodging a few bumblebees and almost tripping as my dog ran under my legs. It was spring, no doubt about that. <br /> <br /> Sitting on the hammock, I turned on my music. Though it didn't suit the weather, it was slightly motivating. Immigrant punk was all the rage when beating procrastination. I put myself in the horizontal position, my head resting on the pillow. I could hear the faint sound of a car pulling up somewhere. As I looked towards the grave yard, I saw two devastatingly handsome black men. They were both dressed in white t-shirts. &ldquo;<i style="""">Probably visiting a late relative or friend,&rdquo; </i>I thought to myself. I muttered a small prayer and went back to my &ldquo;work.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I flipped through my rough draft, crossing out words, rephrasing&hellip;the normal editing routine. I glanced back at the graveyard and saw a mob of white and red shirts, plus a bunch of red balloons. This wasn&rsquo;t so ordinary. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be morbidly intrigued and curious. I turned off my music to be polite and pretended to be flipping through one of my books. They didn&rsquo;t say much, nothing that I could hear anyways, and they stood still. I sighed and remained outside, my homework getting the best of me.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">In the corner of my eye, I saw a mass of red fly through the air. The red balloons that I saw earlier were released from their bindings and set free. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>I watched them for as long as I could, until the last trace of red disappeared. The sound of a woman mourning interrupted the whirring sound of my sister&rsquo;s air conditioner. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize&hellip;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&hellip;This woman probably lost her child. How I wanted to hop the fence and hug this stranger! How I wanted to join them, tell them that their child was free!! Tears filled my own eyes as I closed my laptop. I could no longer be a witness. I couldn&rsquo;t help them. I couldn&rsquo;t comfort them. Their tears wouldn&rsquo;t soak my shirt, their cries wouldn&rsquo;t be muffled in my shoulder and my hands would not rub their back in a gentle effort to console them. I was helpless.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m inside now, the service still going on. Though it&rsquo;s a beautiful day, I need to be selfless. They need to have as much space as possible. They don&rsquo;t need a stranger mourning. They need that stranger to be happy, to know how precious life is.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">And I can assure them. I know.</p>  <br /><br />"

"event","Since Friday, all I have been doing is cleaning. Hmm, cleaning doesn't sound like the correct word. It's more like <strong><em>scouring</em></strong>. I've cleaned out three cabinets, filled up two heavy trash bags with food that we wasted (and&nbsp;I feel bad that our family wastes so much), sanitized the inside, and organized them. It may sound easy, but it definitely is not. It's very time consuming; looking at every single item for the expiration date and figuring out whether or not we will consume the items that have not yet reached the their tme of death. <br /><br />After organizing the three cabinets, I&nbsp;had to wash the outside of the cabinets (and I washed the inside too). Once again, this doesn't sound like too big of a job. But we have cabinets on the ground, and cabinets attached to the ceiling. I have no clue how many I washed, but I still have one side to do. After that, I removed most of the cobwebs in the corners, and did a lot of laundry. Hell, there's still <em><strong>more </strong></em>laundry to do! <br /><br />However, I am not complaining. Just merely stating the stuff that I had to do to get ready for Thanksgiving. Our house (at least the downstairs) has to be pleasing to the eyes of the <em><strong>30 guests</strong></em><em><strong> (!)</strong></em> who own them. Yes. 30 people gathered around the many tables of our dining room. How will we all fit, I have no idea. We're actually running a test run to see how many tables we can fit. The lack of chairs isn't helping either. My mom said it should be a B.Y.O.Fin.C. I&nbsp;thought she meant &quot;Bring Your Own <em>Fucking </em>Chair,&quot;&nbsp;but she meant folding chairs. <br /><br />Speaking of various items of furniture, I no longer have a bed. My futon broke, meaning sleeping on it makes my back hurt a lot. At the moment, I'm sleeping on a &quot;mattress&quot; at the floor. A futon &quot;mattress&quot; isn't really a mattress at all. Anyways,&nbsp;after reviewing my options, I decided to ask my dad for a new bed. Of course, he hasn't really been in town to talk about it (the life of a gospel quartet singer leaves many weekends occupied). I felt incredibly discouraged for a while especially because my room looks like a tornado tore through it. I was flipping through a book and found the cutest room...that has just a mattress on the floor. It was all handmade furniture (headboard, lamps) and it was all covered in flowers, something that would match my summertime bedroom scheme. I plan on making the best of my mattress (and distracting myself for the time to come) and decorating my room like the one in this picture. Yay creativity and glue guns!<br /><br />The Holidays should prove to be quite interesting. Christmas includes the one year anniversary of my grandfather's death (not the exact date, but pretty damn close). I&nbsp;know I'll be pretty down, but my mom is going to be a wreck. However, I hope we are semi distracted. We have a lot of people to shop for. We have, not only each other, but nephews and my niece. Not to mention, my boyfriend and his family. <br /><br />I'll be spending about 12 days in Ohio. That includes getting there three days after Christmas and a long train ride, 11 hours to be exact. The trip will definitely be worth it. New Years is going to be fantastic! This will be the first New Years in a loooong time where I didn't stay at home and stare at my television or go to a party and be completely ignored the whole time. I'm actually going to be at a party with his friends, at his house, with a bonfire and lots of alcohol. I might as well record the whole thing cause chances are, by 4am January 1st, I'll be passed out on his bed. I plan on partying hard. Now, don't you worry your little heads about me. I'll have Mike there to protect me (from his friends?) and his aunt will also be there. <br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving!!!<br /><br /><br />"

"event","Woo! Friday is gonna be awesome! I'm&nbsp; carving an awesome pumpkin with &nbsp;Mike and then we're possibly going down to my brother's house to help give out candy (we don't get any trick-or-treaters). Then we're going to play a drinking game to Ghost Hunters LIVE! 7 Hours of booze and ghosts.

Hopefully before he leaves, we'll be making another trip to Gettysburg. The first time we went there, we went to my second cousin's antique shop. He sells memorabilia from the Civil War era all the way up to Johnny Depp's autograph. It's all authentic with a few replicas. After we were about to leave, he handed me a gigantic replica cavalry sword...for free. How awesome is that?!? He also said to call him before come back and visit, and he'll give us a private tour of all the battlefields. We plan to do that and make a power point presentation for my Civil War and Reconstruction class.

We went on a ghost tour too. It was 2 hours with an old unenthusiastic woman dressed in period clothing. Though it was kind of long and boring (almost a ghost sighting), it was informative. Plus the kids on campus were hilarious. Some guy drove by blasting the Ghostbusters theme song. I was tickled pink!

The next ghost tour, we plan to be slightly inebriated. This one takes you off the trail and into dark alleys. Sounds like my kind of tour!

Woooo!"

"event","Don't tell me that the stuff that I believe in is bullshit. 

The fact of the matter is, I respect your beliefs or lack thereof. Though I don't agree, I certainly am NOT going to call it bullshit, because it isn't. It's your expressed view. It's your opinion. 

Beliefs are based on faith and hope, and not necessarily fact. If everything had to be proved, we'd be a whole bunch of robots from the same company.&nbsp;There wouldn't be any opinions. People should be respected for believing in something, not frowned upon and insulted. Is it so bad to have hope? Is it so stupid to feel as though you had someone to talk to that would listen, but not exactly in a physical state? It comforts some people...perhaps it's a security blanket.

I don't feel the need to argue over religion vs. atheism. What's the point? I'm not trying to convert you, so don't try to convert me. You don't believe in a higher being? Okay. Well I do. I just ask you to not call my beliefs bullshit. You believe that there's no higher being. I&nbsp;don't call it bullshit. I call it a belief. I respect your belief. I'm not going to say &quot;oh, well...there is a God, blah blah blah.&quot; I'm gonna accept it and change the subject. If I say &quot;Oh, I'll pray about it.&quot; Don't roll your eyes and go on a tirade about science and fact. Just tolerate it."

"event","...so I've taken a vow of silence to last until 6pm tonight. It's not a long vow, but I do need to concentrate on getting my voice back. 

Yes. I've lost my voice. That's the consequence for having an awesome labor day weekend. 

Allie and I went to Busch Gardens on Monday...and rode all the rollercoasters in the front...except for Big Bad Wolf. We wanted to ride that in the back. Let me tell ya, I lost my voice while riding the Griffon. AMAZING!!!! There was hardly anyone there because it was labor day and everyone was like &quot;OMGAH! FIRST&nbsp;DAY&nbsp;OF&nbsp;SCHOOL&nbsp;TOMORROW!!!&quot; So, after that we drove to Norfolk and crashed at my brother's house. Literally crashed. 

The next day we woke up at 7:30 and went to the beach. Except...my car was covered in mud and dead bugs and bird pee (because they don't really poop). Anyways, we drove to the beach and hung out. Let me tell ya, the waves kicked our asses. THANKS&nbsp;GUSTAV!!! As we relaxed on the shore, we contemplated taking a shower somewhere. My brother's house was locked and I didn't know of any public showers that were free....meaning I didn't have to pay for parking. So I called my dad and told him about our awesome trip and the fact that there was crap on my car and sand in my suit.

&quot;Well, there's a self car wash on 17th.&quot;

Off to the car wash on 17th. We got the crap off of our car and then thought &quot;hmm...a hose...water...let's get this sand off of us!&quot; So we definitely took a shower in the car wash.

I don't recommend it."

"event","Dear TOM, 
 I'm ecstatic to know that you're now becoming a regular visitor. It just means the PCOS isn't doing too bad. But why do you visit at the most inopportune times? 
  
 For example. Deciding to drop by and see me while at a Redskins game is never good. Never EVER good. Especially when I don't have any change on me, and I didn't see a tampon/pad dispenser anywhere. So I had to stuff my cute pink underwear with public bathroom toilet paper. We all know that public bathroom toilet paper is the worst paper. It has the consistency of a paper towel. 
  
 Needless to say, that game wasn't very enjoyable. Not because the Redskins only scored 3 points, but because you decided to invite your other friends and have a big whole party. This is doing a number on my ovaries. They're hurting like whoa. Could you please tell them to leave? After all, they're your friends. 
  
 Since I'm a nice person, I'm giving you until Sunday to leave. However, if your friends don't leave right away, I'm going to have to do something myself. Perhaps call my good friend Midol. He'll kick them out and then some. Now, if you're still here by Monday, I have no choice but...well...but to deal with it. Monday, I'll be going to an amusement park, but I have no desire to entertain you. 
   
  Love,  
     Me."

"event","&nbsp;So...this weekend kicked ass! 

Friday: Went to Ladies Night at the Pfitz with Allie and Shawn. Though the team lost, we still had a lot of fun joking around with the pitchers. One of them wanted to crash a fake party Shawn was hosting. Shawn admitted that it was actually Bible Study. He still wanted to crash it...and bring the beer.

Saturday: MARIE'S LAST SUPPER! I'm soooo glad that I didn't have to stay for ""family night."" I went to Marie's house (and didn't get lost!!!) and we left from there. Her friend Alaina drove to Grace's in Bethesda. Dinner was crazy expensive, but it was still hella fun. After that, I didn't want to go home, so Alaina and I went to Rocky Horror Picture show. While we were waiting, about 10 + bikes pulled up to the theatre. All of the riders were about 40 +. It was about 10x as fun because of that.

Sunday: Slept in until about 1pm. I got home at 3:30am and went to bed around 4:00am. Of course I would've been tired. After getting groceries (and leaving my wallet at home), I threw on a semi-cute ensemble and went to Word of Life to hear my daddy's group sing. His group moves me to tears. The harmonies are beautiful and the words...amazing."

"event","Please note the sarcasm in my subject.
&nbsp;
I need my room back. It's not a want...it's a need. I feel selfish, considering all the people in Myanmar&nbsp; are left without homes and are standing exposed in the brutal weather's wrath, but I do feel the need to vent. I should feel lucky to have a roof over my head and even a bed to lay my head. I am...I truly am, but please, allow me to vent on the current conditions of my life.

It is 6:30am. I must've slept about an hour; the minutes scattered throughout the night. I'm sleeping in my mom's room, considering that my bed is covered with dry stuff. There are bags and bags of wet clothes in trash bags in my garage. They were on the floor because I was sorting through them and reorganizing my room until the procrastination monster bit me hard. I should take more trash bags upstairs because I was too exhausted to do that last night...that and make the shit on my bed neat and tidy because my brother and my dad's workers are coming over to pump the water out. I'm pretty sure my dad is going to lecture them considering that they didn't do their job. They were supposed to seal a pipe or something, or have it empty outside, but instead the pipe just backed up and when it rained, the thing exploded into the basement.

My mom has asthma. A bad bad case of asthma. She hasn't taken her steroids and needs to. She spent most of the night coughing. Not just a *cough cough* but several coughs which had me getting up and checking to see if she was alright. Her breathing is heavy and quick which also worries me to death.

The alarm went off at around 6:10am. My mom didn't get up. I climbed out of her bed and hit the snooze button (note: the alarm clock is on the other side of the room) and woke her up. She mumbled something so I laid back down. About 10 minutes later the alarm clock went off again. I rolled out of bed and hit the snooze button. Repeat this step about three more times. 

The fact of the matter is, I can't sleep. My head feels as though it's bound to explode or my brain leak from both of my clogged ears. My throat is slowly filling up with mucus which can only be forced back down. The affects of standing outside in the pouring rain wearing only a tank top and shorts, and standing in rooms up to my ankle with water emptying it out.

I'm tired. I'm bitter. I'm sick. 

I just want my room back. A quiet place to curl up with my stuffed animals (most of which are acting as sponges) and go to sleep. To lay in my room surrounded by my Nationals memorabilia (if memorabilia means a poster of Ryan Zimmerman and a Nationals blanket...luckily their dry and safe) with Camille Saint-Saens Organ Symphony #3 playing softly in the background. Unfortunately I'm left to deal with the alarm clock going off once more and tripping over my mom's purse in the process of turning it off.&nbsp; O Fortuna anyone?

Ryan Zimmerman's all wet (my stuffed bear), Hiccups is holding water (my stuffed frog my boyfriend won me), my cuddle blanket is wet&nbsp; (another item from my boyfriend) and chances are I'm going to get bitched at again for not bringing my shit up tonight. Yes, throughout this whole catastrophe I got bitched at. Go figure.

More bitching at livejournal later."

The start of a new week means a start of a new conviction. I have several plans...one as crazy as the other but each one manageable. 

The two main things that must be done:

1. Go to the doctor's about my back. 
2. Laundry mat.

"event","As of next year, my life will be changing significantly. My boyfriend (and one of my best friends for about four years) and I are actually going to move to an apartment together in the spring. It just proves that the thing you want&nbsp; the most might be right under your nose. His friend might be living with us to help us with rent, but he's pretty cool.&nbsp; I finally figured out my major which has nothing to do with music (strangely enough) and hopefully in a few years I can finally start a career in sports entertainment.&nbsp; By next year (if things are working out) I should be engaged. Scary thought, but it's about damn time for me to settle down.

Right now, I'm incredibly busy with job hunting. I was nominated for president in VAPAA but I have to decline, mainly because I have to take a full load of classes plus working. I have to have enough hours with a pretty good pay to actually pay rent and bills. Perhaps a government job? They have great pay and benefits.

I'll figure it out some other time. It's sleep time."

You do NOT live here.

Don't complain when the washing machine doesn't work and your clothes are wet. Didn't you remove my clothes from the dryer (when they were still wet) so you could wash your clothes...the night I had to leave for my trip? You come over just to wash your clothes.

Don't get pissed when you pick up the phone and someone's on it. Once again, you do not live here. Some other people like to have conversations on the phone...people who indeed live here.

The computer is a family computer. When the kids are home, they have first priority. Don't sit on there for&nbsp; 3 hours watching cars on youtube. Get off your ass and let the kids use it. You aren't using it for work or school. 

The kitchen is stocked with certain foods that everyone likes. Don't complain that there's no food. You aren't paying for the groceries...you aren't writing the grocery list, so stop fucking complaining.

Another thing. Call before you come over. You are about to enter a house full of girls. Girls who like to walk around in their pj's without their bras. It's getting quite annoying to run upstairs to use the bathroom and you're sitting on your ass at the computer. Traci and I call before we get home...and we live here! 

It's called being polite. It's called being grateful. Say thank you for Heaven's Sake."

I don't want my feelings to affect someone else. I don't want my problems to be theirs. I don't want them to have to worry about it. 

When I have a lot going on, the littlest thing can ignite the flame and make me explode. I want to throw things, break things. I'm hazardous. I admit being childish, but at the same time I become angry and hurt. A mix of emotions that can only be interpret through tears and sobs. 

I can't handle a list of things to be thrown at me and expect them to be done all at the same time. I can't handle a huge list being thrown at me period. I get overwhelmed. I have to have it written down because it's easier for me if it's organized on paper. My mind jumbles up words and actions making me become frustrated.

There was a family of graves that made me somber yet very curious. 

Clara E. Toomer
May 3, 1885 - September 1, 1972 (around 87)

Horace N. Toomer
May 10, 1877 - April 28, 1923 (around 46)

Horace N. Toomer Jr.
October 16, 1917 - February 5, 1918 (around four months)

French S. Toomer
April 17, 1921 - December 19, 1922 (around one year and nine months)

I want to know their story. I want to know their life. Was it hard to make ends meet? Did they live a good life? What made them happy? Most of all, what happened with their children...

I plan to go in February to lay flowers on their graves. I don't know anything about them, I wasn't related to them in any way, yet I can't help but be drawn to them."

"event","I've never been so cold at a game in my life!

I had on my long sleeved shirt, a sweatshirt, a Nationals Jacket and a jersey...I was still cold. But not as cold as my feet. I had on two pairs of socks, but when your feet are resting on a block of ice (literally), they get cold fast. I've never seen my dad shiver or look really cold until last night.

So, we lost Jason Campbell...dislocated knee. Nik messaged me during the game and said it looked very painful...I just saw it this morning and I cringed in pain. Apparently Smoot was sick and so were several other members of the team. It's probably fatigue. You can get sick from not getting enough sleep and working hard...the past x days have been hard and emotionally draining for them. I was very impressed with them...

And can we give a hand to Yoder?!? I think so.


In other words, I'm tired. I had to wake up at 6:30am to walk the dogs. The dogs slept with me last night so that was new. Jersey (one of the dogs) kept barking every two hours. I didn't want to wake the neighbors, so that involved me getting up and mumbling ""Jersey...shhh...come here."" Anyways, at 6:30am, I looked outside and it was still dark. I didn't want to walk them in the dark, especially in an area which I'm not used to. I'd wake up every thirty minutes until the sun was up. That or until Jersey barked.

I'm so exhausted. It's been quite the emotional week. I need to get my brakes replaced, my mom keeps coughing and needs to go to the doctor once again to check it out, my grandfather is in the hospital with pneumonia...his kidneys are failing. Apparently he couldn't recognize my aunt (which he is pretty close to) and he tried to walk out the window. He's 80 years old, so pneumonia isn't the best thing. I wasn't too close to him, but close enough to be incredibly worried. My mom is pretty upset over it. She's really close to her dad.

I think I'm gonna go back to sleep until 11.

*~*Added: I got to see Joe Theismman from two feet. It was incredibly cold and though I wanted a picture with him, he looked cold himself and I just wanted to get to the car. My dad and I stopped and stared for a second before we were like ""Holy crap..."" Also...some dumbass ran onto the field. He was immediately tackled. I was immediately amused.*~*"

 We need a bigger place so I can stop sharing a room with him. Yeah that's right we share a room and have been doing so for the past 3 years and counting. But just so you don't think something freaky is going on let me tell you that we have our OWN beds! This is why we need a bigger place to live, but not just any place. I want a place I can call home. Not just another house or apartment. I want to own a house, I want to be able to know that I don't have a landlord. If I want to remodel the basement and make a kick ass gaming room or a movie room out of it I can. God willing, if I ever get a girlfriend I want a place (my room) I can take her that doesn't have pops bed in it as well. I want a room I can call my own where I can have the cord to the X-box hanging in front of the dresser and I don't have to worry about someone coming and unplugging it in the morning because ""I couldn't get in to my dresser to get my socks because your cord was in the way"". I want to be able to blast KoRn or Slipknot in my room if I want to and not have to think of pops watching TV in the same room or the neighbor down stairs or across the hall. 

Ok I'm done bitching for today, but I'm sure I'll think of something else to bitch and moan about tomorrow or the next day."

Dreams the dreams
You dream so well
For in our beds
We both do dwell
Dream the dream
That lovers do
Late at night
I dream of you
Tossing and turning
In my bed
With images of you
In my head
Dream these dreams
Those lonesome nights
When no one's around
And there's tears
In your eyes
Dream those dreams
And know it true
That here I dream
Of only you

I sware I had ot have heard my name called every 5 seconds some of the time or people asking or help. And it seemed as if I were the only one who knew anything about the store and it's products. So that part I don't miss all that much. Well I'm doing the maintenance thing for now and well see how money flows in from that alone. I should be more then fine with it though, seeing as I have nothing or no one to spend it on... but it's all good. What that they say? All good things come in time. Speaking of which, I just got a cell phone of my own. If you want the number just leave a message and I'll see if I want to give it to you :P."

To the people that showed up I thank you grately and you shall be missed. To those who couldn't make it, it's been nice knowing you... maybe I'll see you around some time.

It feels strange not having to goto work at Michael's(HELL) anymore. I'm happy but at the same time I'm going to miss going there and seeing the friends I've made over the years. But at the same time I'm happy I never have to go see that fat bastard Ken any more. Or put up with the customers bothering me all the damn time! 

Well... that's pretty much it. Oh and thank you once more to those of you who came last night, and remember we're doing it again in 3 weeks for Mich's party (she's quiting as well)."

"event","Well it's been a while sense I've writen anything so here it goes.

These past 2 weeks have been the same as usual, nothing big happening in them and such. I've been getting the screan names of a few of the people I work with that I hadn't had before. That's cool, though I don't see us keeping in contact after I leave for some reason it always works out that way. There is a few people I know will refuse to lose contact with me, they are the stubren ones :P . I was asked last night by John if I was still leaving and I told him yes, so he asked when my last day was and I told him I though it was Saturday but he only had me down for Thursday(tonight) as my last night so ... I offered to work on Saturday 9-5 and he said ok. I don't think he wants me to go, but for different reasons then the other people don't want to see me go. 
For some reason they(the ""bosses"") have been putting me and this one girl together at work, don't get me wrong I'm not complaning she's a great girl and beautiful in every way. I just find it odd that they put people with me now that I'm leaving more then they used to. 
Monday night I pissed on of the managers Joe pretty good. Ok, Jeff was closeing manager and he doesn't mind me listening to my CD player while sweeping the floor at night. Joe comes in at about 8:45 right before we closed and by this point I had the headphones on for about 30-40 min. Joe said ""Headphones"" and pointed to his ears. Like the smartass that I am I said ""yup that's what they are."" he told me to take them off and then walked into the back room to clock in. I'm like screw that! He's not even closing manager fuck him. So I keep my music going and keep sweeping the floor like normal when John comes up to me and said that Joe was bitching that I had them on after he'd told me to remove them and could I please do so. I said ""You don't mind, Jeff, doesn't mind, hell Ken doesn't even mind and he hates the ground I walk on. But Joe and Stacy both have a bug up their ass' about me and my CD player... what's up with that?"" John said "" I'm not sure but could you turn it off so I don't have to hear him cry any more"" So being the nice guy I am, I turn it off but leave it around my neck to piss Joe off >: ) .
 Well Sunday night we're having a party for those of us who are leaving. That should be fun. Then I probibly will never see any of those people again... sad but what can you do? If Michaels would have treated those of us who are leaving or thinking of leaving better maybe they wouldn't be in despret need of workers at this moment..."

"event","Well I finaly did it after 3 years of hell I put in my 2 week notice. I've been working at the same dead end position for the past 3 years, never given the chance to move up in position. I'm making a wopping $7.58 an hour after the 10 cent raise I just got from a review writen by a ""man"" who I've only worked with a hand full of times. And not only did I not get a good review, I got the worst raise our ass. manager john said he's seen... So I had enough of that shit hole! I mean how is someone who has been working there for 1 year and is the same position making the same amount of money as me who has been there for 3 years?! What kind of bullshit is that?! And that was not directed to the person who is making the same money as I am in any way shape or form. It's directed to the ass holes who run the joke called Michaels arts and crafts! They fucked me at every turn then got pissy when I started ramming them in the ass the same way! Ken, the jack ass who wrote the review has it in for me and has sense day one. He yells at me once in a while and I yell back and make him look like the fat, bald, sniveling, incompitent, moron that he is! So he gets me back the only way he could... my yearly review. all I have to say is ""They fuck you at the drive threw!"""

"event","Yesterday was an ok day. I got up did the shower thing, still feeling kinda drawn down because of this flu thing but I'm doing better then I was. So I get to work and John's like ok guys I'm placing Kathrine and Nate together in yard to downstock. Can I just say that I do not like downstocking yarn... but this time it wasn't all that bad, short shit wasn't there to bug the shit out of me. Don't get me wrong she's cool and all but she get rather annoying at times. So it Kathrine and myself, Erin and Jamie those were the teams and a few others also closed. They called Erin and Cathrine to their Reg. all damn day long, so the yarn got like 2/3 done if that and the pain brushes that Erin and Jamie did were finished by the end of the night because they took an extra hour or 2 longer to do them after everyone else had stoped doing that and started cleaning. And it showed because they did a great job on them. But it also showed that the people that shop at our store are fucking slobs because at 7:00 when we closed the store, what do we see but 6 yes 6 carts of reshop to put back before we can leave... Like the crazy ass people we all are, we get it done in 45 min. Now that's good timeing! 

Oh I almost forgot to mention something! John called the 4 of us that were in the little groups into the office and told us to go clean 1 - 20. So I'm thinking ""Yeah fun, all of us in one place at one time we're going to get in the way of each other!"". But it worked because jamie ran off and started at 20 and Erin and Cathrine started at 1 while I was on my 15min. break. When I got back Cathrine went and it was Erin and I cleaning in 6A as this nice black lady who looked to be about 40 or so hears Erin ask me what my sign was. I said Picies or how ever it's spelled. She said the 2 fisheis? Yeah the fishies, and the black lady said Oh he'll make a good husband! Picies always do. This is where Erin says yeah well I'm a Scorpio and the lady says something, I'm going to leave it at that and says that I'd never want to leave Erin. Well Erin and I are dieing she on the floor sitting agenst the pole and I'm coughing up a lung as I do now when I laugh because of this flu.
That lady is ok in my book and I'd like to know where she got the meanings of the signs because I want to see this for myself ;-)"

"event","Ok so it's been a while sence I've made a real post in this thing so here it is.

Lets start with friday. Friday pops and I chilled all day insted of working, I took the doughter of the guy who runs the office out to lunch for helping me with something. And no, there's nothing going on there. But then when pops and I are going to the bank to deposit our checks I get a call from my 14 year old cuz named Alex. Alex: ""Yo when you coming to my house? the movie starts at 7:40pm..."" Me: ""Be there in 10, so hold your horses there spanky!"". so after a huge fuck up on my part involving SEPTA we get to where we were going. I go up to the counter and said one for Res. evil, I pay then walk in then the girl turns to me and asks how old I am and if I have ID. I'm like ""Wut... what for""? Oh this kid's only 14 and he need someone over 21 to see this movie because it's rated R. So by this point in the night I'm like OH HELL NO! this shit is not happening to me now... because of course I have no ID on me on this night. so we get tickets to Paveratizy or how ever the peace of shit movie is spelled. we get out drinks and head up to the girl taking the tickets and I see that the movie is at the same entrance as the one we have tickets for. so I think to myself, why the hell not.. they never check tickets... and you guessed it... 5 min. into the movie a guy with a flashlight comes up to us and says ""can I see your tickets"" I'm like FUCK! why couldn't Alex just have kept his mouth shut when I started heading for the ""wrong"" movie and why were the only 2 fucking seats in the damn theater right next to the door. so we get kicked out of that movie and sent to the one we had tickets for *mutter* can I just say it was almost as bad as the spice girls movie...

Then there was yesterday. It was a better day over all, I opened so I was up at 7:00am and in by about 8:45am which gave me time to eat something before clocking in. before going to work I always goto Wawa and get a drink for the day and something for breakfast and lunch. when I got up to the girl my total was $6.66 , she pointed it out and snickered. I said ""Hay my lucky number! This is going to be a good day"" then I gave an evil grin and went to work. work took forever like old people in a 10 mile foot race. Then came 5:00pm, I clocked out and went with Mish and them to her house for brians suprise BBQ party. let me just say now that a lot of the night is a blur, Brian and I got shit faced and took over the bathroom. He got the tub and I got the toilet, and there we stayed for about and hour or more. we were telling people that needed to use the bathroom that we were not moving and to use the tub. One of the girls snuck in while I left the bathroom and pissed with brian in there after tossing a towel over his head, then she started yelling ""I have purple undies!"" then from what I hear she showed a few people to prove it. once she left the bathroom I waqs right back in there with my head in the toilet once more, and throwing up the water I was just given becaue I was as white as a ghost. as I lay there Mish tells me she's going to be right back because she's going to get me a bowl so I can go lie down on a bed. Well I get sick and tired of waiting and I fall asleep with my head in the toilet, waking up a while later to her saying ""where the hell did they go? no one is watching you 2..."" I said ""what happened to my bowl?"" she's like Oh yeah and she runs down to get one for me, but in the time it takes her to do so I'm in bed and passed out.

And that brings us into this morning. I wake up frezing my ass off. YOU THINK THOSE ASS' WOULD PUT A BLANKET ON THE DRUNK PASSED OUT GUY? NO! *mutter* :P but anyhoo. I find a blanket and look at the clock it's now 5:30 something in the morning... and to top it off I have a spliting headack, cotten mouth, and my eyes are killing me from throwing up so much. after a lot of just trying to wake up and getting a shower I get down stairs to see Erin asleep, brial and chrissy watching a movie. I get something to eat real quick and then get some asprin for the lingering headack. when I was coming back from tossing out my trash from breakfast I saw erin still sleeping so I decided to mess with her and poke her in the top of her head a few times... I got no responce in any way shape or form. so brian and I had a good laugh about it and started watching Ind. Jones, it got to a part that had this chick drink shots and we almost tossed our cookies again... then we got erin up finally and she got a shower and we went to work..yes work...*sobs*

Can I just say sorry to all of you who have ever worked even with a slight hangover... I feel your pain. I felt and liiked like death all day, it was horible. and on top of it everyone wanted to mess with me about it and this didn't help my headack in the least. Buy I would have done this day over again if only not to have to spnd friday night with my cuz, now that was pain... Now I'm home and I feel like a little better but I still can feel the affects of last night and I need sleep and water. 

so that was my weekend in all it's glory. I know there's more but I just don't feel like typing any more so any of you who were there feel free to fill in the blank spots of my night. Oh and note to self: never let brian mix you a drink after he's drunk, they are WAY to strong!"

That has become my life
Floats along in a never ending storm

Lightning crashes down all around me

Void of all emotion
I wonder the world hollow and alone
Lost in this sea so vast

Swallow the fear and the pain
So no one see the hurt
That's not so deep inside

Fighting back these wretched tears
Of loneleness

Pain
Your only friend

Hate
Your horrid gift

Happiness
Something not often felt
in this world so cold

My life

Dragons are very mysterious creatures who often<br>live alone in caves with hoards of gold. You<br>keep yourself from others and contain many<br>armoured plates for defence. However,  you will<br>be kind to others if they are kind to you. You<br>are very thrifty and rarely waste any money.

"event","First off this is not directed toward anyone in particular, I just need to vent. 

All I want is to feel loved. Is that so wrong? I want someone to share my life with, a fucking girlfriend... this is all I want. I'm sick of being alone! People ask me if I'm ok, when I say no they act as if I'm joking. When I say I'm always depressed and I'm just a good actor don't fucking laugh at me you dumb ass's, even if it's not meant as a mean laugh.

Every time I like a girl she never shares the feeling, so why the fuck do I try? Why torture myself? Why even care? I have come to the conclusion that people are cold hearted in nature. their only reason for being on this world is to suffer then die, which only causes more suffering for others... 

And no, I don't want any of your comments on this so keep them to your self."

Draped in black
Standing in a somke filled room
I see your face
Looking into your eyes
I was lost in your gaze

Loud music quiets as I look on
Flashing lights dim then point at you
People dancing part from around us
Everything fades as I was lost in you gaze
Unsure of what was to come next

Wanting to do so much
But doing so little...

Stunned
All I can do is look on and smile
While looking at the beaust which stands before me

Holding you close the whole night through
Never wanting to let you loose
My pulse races every time
You come near

Once again

"event","Ok, this is one of those sappy journal entries so if you don't want to read it then fuck off :-P  

It's hard for me to experss how I feel to people. I could be so depressed and lonely on the inside but seem so happy on the outside. I have a probiblem expressing how I feel twards people, girls mainly. Like for example I realy like this girl, we get along great and all but I'm not sure how to tell her how I feel. I want so badly to ask her out but just can't get up the courage to do so. Every time I'm with her it's kinda like the world seems to fade and everything's alright for the short time that we're together. And yes I know I sould like a moron, but I can't help it. *shrug* This is how I feel, I just can't seem to be able to tell her these things. All I want to do is ask her out... then see where it goes from there. Don't get me wrong I would love for her to say yes, but if she doesn't feel the same for me as I do for her then it's ok I guess. I just hope we're still friends after/if I finaly ask.

Well like I said it was going to be a sappy moment so tell me what I should do. I welcome any and all advice."

"event","Last night I went to this club called Shampoo with Mish, Brian, Court, Erin, and Chrissy(a friend of Mish's). Wednesday nights are goth/80's night at shampoo, of course I chill in the goth room almost the entire night except for like maybe 10 min. The greatest part of the goth room isn't the music, it's the mosh pit at midnight. I always get on the edge and throw guys back in. When it's time for the girls pit time we try not to be so rough with then , throwing them in and all but sometimes you have to just pick one up and toss her ass in. It's like stop being a bitch and only jumping people from behind, go hit her face to face and see what happens. So needless to say the girl pit time sux and only lasts maybe 2 songs as where the guys pit time lasts like 4 or 5 songs. 

Well lets see what else happened last night at the club? Umm... Mish though she'd be funny ahd smash her ass into my frontal area, which she's done on meny opcasions befor, and no not like that you perverted bastered. The only diff was this time she hit me just right and well.... how can I saw this... she smashed my boys. But it's all good, after a few min. I could stand again. 

I also got a date to Lori's wedding yesterday, which I'm very happy she said yes. I was telling the girl(who shall remain un-named bacause certen people I work with that have big mouths and will start all kinds of rumers know where my LJ is and read it) what I'm planing on wearing to the wedding because it's a hawaiian luau reception. So I'm wearing a grass luau skirt that we sell at Mike's. Of course I got laughed at for saying that but it's all good :P .

After we left the club we went to Dennies for dinner/breakfast. We sat around and bullshited for a while, the lady came to take our order and asked what kind of eggs I wanted I said ""suprise me"" her responce was ""so you want them raw? Wouldn't that be a suprise."" I said ""Ummm nah, I'll pass on the raw eggs thank you. But I would like the eggs cooked, I just don't know how I want them..."" So everyone ordered and she asked me ""Aren't you happy I didn't suprise you with raw eggs?"" all I could do was nod because I had a mouth full of food at the moment. HAHA funny lady *mutter* So we leave to go home and Mish droped Erin and Court off first because thay would have gotten in trouble if they got home as late as they would have if I got droped off first. Then Mish took me home, I didn't get in untill about 4:00am and I woke up this morning at 8:00am for work... Well that was my big night out at the club. Oh and if I bored you to death with my stories of last night TO BAD!  >:) Muhahahahahaha"

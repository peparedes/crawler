Standing in the towns small flower shop helping the lady behind the counter arrange some flowers he had picked out for Zex again. 
A Epiphyllum and a big twigy stick thing in one hand, with the other he pointing out somethings in a book. The lady walked away, disappearing in the back to get something leaving Marluxia standing alone in the store."

"event","Walking out the front of the hotel, he had convenced his foreign boss to let Marluxia go home and sleep. 
Sneezing as he walked up to his car... he threw up a napkin to hold his runny nose. ""mother fu-"" another sneeze as he struggled to open the car door. He sat down and leaned his face on the stearing wheel ""where did this come from?"" he wondered aloud still holding his nose. Starting the car he started his way back to his dorm.. 
to his nice warm bed.. and other things."

"event","At work again.... thinking about asking for the day shifts again. I would rather be at the dorm late at night. I get the feeling I'm missing out on.. things.
Back when I had no Life, this was fine, but now its kind of annoying. 
bringing me to another thought... Whats Zex doing, should I call him? 
...  
some lady just asked me if she could use the pool.... its f'ing 3 in the morning. Who keeps the pool open all night?! christ. ((works at a hotel! yes ..i win))
I should make Zex come use the pool..... at 3 in the morning. 
hm yeah. 

On another note. I'm getting sick, I think I downed 3 alka-seltzer today... and still can't breath through my nose. what a pain.

Why do I feel Like I just did?
Well I'm glade I took him back to the dorm.. and not just pass out in the car.
I did not drink nearly enough last night.

I didn't stay at the dorm last night.. couldn't sleep. sorry. Just went and waited in the parking lot of the building I had class in.
It was silly of me to want so much. He wont remember.. so unforchenetly it was just a one night thing... 
This makes me feel like shit.
That was the wrong way to get what I wanted."

"event","Marluxia hadn't done anything today but lounge around, no class .. so he didn't really know what to do with his time. watch tv, eat, think about doing home work.. come on, it sounded so exciting.
At around 3 he decided to do some research in the library.
and now he was walking back from the grocery store to the dorm room with a piece of paper and a bag in his hands. 

walking in he looked to see Zexion dilagently doing homework. ""I got you something."" 
handing Zexion the paper with some addresses on it, and holding up eggs."

I don't have a whole lot I wanna tell any of you. I could tell you about my job.. but it sucks. 
I only take.. 3 classes right now, one I don't even go to half the time.. no one showers in it. I don't party, because its retarded to be surrounded by retarded people. I havent found the right club yet. 
And I don't know anyone, except my emotionally challenged roommate and his baffiling friend, but I don't really know anything about them either.
its neat. keeps me on my toes.

"event","How d'you do, I see you've met my faithful handyman
He's just a little brought down because when you knocked
He thought you were the candyman.
Don't get strung out by the way that I look,
Don't judge a book by its cover
I'm not much of a man by the light of day,
But by night I'm one hell of a lover

I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania.

So let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
You look like you're both pretty groovy
Or if you want something visual that's not too abysmal
We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

I'm glad we caught you at home, could we use your phone?
We're both in a bit of a hurry.
We'll just say where we are, then go back to the car
We don't want to be any worry.

So you got caught with a flat, well, how about that?
Well babies, don't you panic.
By the light of the night when it all seems alright
I'll get you a satanic mechanic.

I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania.

So why don't you stay for the night? Or maybe a bite?
I could show you my favourite obsession.
I've been making a man with blond hair and a tan
And he's good for relieving my tension

I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania.

So come up to the lab. And see what's on the slab.
I see you shiver with antici... pation!
But maybe the rain isn't really to blame
So I'll remove the cause, but not the symptom."

No classes today.. I enjoy this new schedule of mine, no more headaches. 
I think i'll keep up the part time thing, although this means I'll have to find things to do during the day.. 
This roommate crap could get annoying. I don't want to find myself butting in on anything.
better then that last roommate ho bag. >>''

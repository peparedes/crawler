FRIDAY~tennis against middletown. it was the best game i have ever watched (no exhibition played, they only had one player and coach needed us to cheer) then we get home to century and wow my parents are out at dinner that they never told me about...so i bummed a ride home with devin
SATURDAY(my 15th BIRTHDAY!)~ p2p meeting we came a half hour late...smooth...but it was a good meeting, i got to meet/bond with people on the trip. we had community service after the meeting and it only took an hour or so and so we all hung out afterwards. then i came home for a few hours and then i went and babysat landy and girly (caroline). i spent the night over there because no one could drive me home, if you get the drift...
SUNDAY~i left the Reeve's house around 10 and came home for a few hours only to leave again for bball. we played girls against parents, which was fun. we only lost by 2 points hehe. then i came home agian for a few hours until we left and went to Cal. T. for dinner. then we came home and ate pie and opned present, i got my BIG one earlier. now i am sitting here. i think ill do sum homework

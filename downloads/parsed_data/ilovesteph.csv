"event","Since you won't talk to me online, and you won't answer my phone calls, the only thing i can do is talk to you here. What have you been doing? How come you won't talk to me? Are you seeing anybody else? Maybe if we actually talked we could figure out whats on each others minds. I keep trying to get a hold of you but you keep ignoring me. It doesn't make sense to just throw away a relationship that we've had for a year and a half. I just wanted you to know that I think about you a lot, and I miss you. It hurts to know that you don't care about me..."

"event","I started off the day today by going up to Macomb and buying my books for next semester. It's funny because all my books this semester are tiny, compared to the huge ass ones I had last semester. Today was a pretty good day for hangin out with the GF. She came over and we watched Forrest Gump, which I must say is a kick ass movie. We chilled for a while and Steph took some cute pictures of us together. Then later we went and seen White Noise. White Noise isnt as kick ass as Forrest Gump, but it's a pretty good movie. I really don't have much goin on these days, except for school is starting back up next week. I'm glad for that, because I'll actually have something to do instead of sitting on my ass all day.

I loved goin to sleep with her in my arms, it made me feel soo calm. Usually I can never sleep and im under sooo much stress but as soon as I closed my eyes I was out. Can I just say that I love Stephanie so much? Im a lot better off now that were in love. I wish every nite could be like last nite. :( Ohh well! Today there was some wicked ass fucken weather and thats not too good to work in. I thought I was going to die! This update wasnt nothin special but I did it for you Steph...cuz I love you baby!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Today was really tiring.
I got out of bed because I had to throw up. I'm really sick. I mean REALLY sick.

I feel a bit strange because we've just moved to Idaho and there's a weird smell in the house.

I'm so hardcore. Me and Buzz went to the mall today, and I stole a whole heap of stuff. I got a Good Charlotte CD, a couple of DVDs and some new boots. Buzz got caught, but he fought his way out, and then we stole some lady's car and smashed it into a phone booth.

Last night I had to masturbate twenty times. I'm so horny. Click here to see my website.

I want to tell the world to get fucked.

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's some photos of my girlfriend in the nude (but don't tell her that I've posted them here - she'll kill me! Har har.)

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself. (Not safe for work - teehee).

"event","As all of you may know, saturday night was the Trapt, Smile Empty Soul, and Strata concert. Stephanie, Stacie and me all went to Harpos to see this rock extravaganza. It was a pretty good time but I liked the last concert a lot better, maybe its just because I like the State Theatre a lot better or something. For one there was absolutely nowhere to fucking park and that was a colossal bitch to deal with. Then when we got inside there wasnt as much room as there is in the State Theatre. To top it all off Finger 11 was not even there and I wanted to see them soo bad cuz I've liked them for a few years now. DONT GET ME WRONG THOUGH IT WAS STILL REALLY FUN!!! Here are some pics from the concert...

those lights look sweet in the background!
<br>
<br>
Anyways at the concert I really didnt like Strata that much, but I really did like Smile Empty Soul. They did Bottom of A Bottle and I was rockin out with my cock out. That was my favorite part of the night, not to mention the singer from SES drinkin a beer in between singing! Trapt came on and the first song they played was Still Frame and that was pretty cool, but the singer was really weird. He was walkin around on stage like he was all holier than thou and shit. After the concert we went to National and got some food cuz I was super hungry. I was about to kill that bitch if she didnt bring me my food faster!!


Today was a famizzle gathering at my grandmas house and it was fun. Steph came with me and we ate some food and hung out with relatives. This is my cousin Nick and hes a super pimp..

I guess from now on when we chill in the living room we need a ""chaperone"" cuz we are just out of control...silly children. I went to work and that was not bad at all. We got a new girl and she was really scared and nervous; I felt really bad for her but I was kinda busy so I really couldnt make her feel welcome. Oh well everyone there is rude so she needs to get used to that. Well well well my stomach is feeling better so what you all think about that?! Concert is in three days so Im getting really excited!

"event","If there was ever a waste of a day, today would be that day...it was just super fucking stupid. Went to school and actually learned some things in class, but thats where it went downhill. Stephanie was sick and I did not get to see her AT ALL and that really burns me up. I just really want to see her. I went to the Verizon Store to get my antenna fixed and they charged me $10 for it...WTF they never charged me before! After that I went to some business seminar that I thought was gonna be worth my time but it was just a big money pyramid scam, and they wanted $235 up front. Fuck that. Mind you all this is going on while I have a stomach ache cuz I am not eating anything. I don't eat cuz I dont feel hungry and later on I get these pains in my stomach and its just not pleasant. I have nothing more to say...au revoir"

"event","I woke up this morning and it felt like someone had been sitting on my stomach all nite...it hurt like a bitch! I got over that for a while and went to pick up my girl from school. I was thinking that we had a early release instead of a half day, and I was gonna feel really dumb for comin up there an hour early. Then we chilled at my house all day and we fell asleep on my luxury bed! That thing is such a piece of shit i swear! I didnt wanna leave her but I had to so that I could go to work. Work was pretty boring so I left an hour earlier than what i was supposed to. Steph wrote i love you on my keyboard so everyone has to call it the sex keyboard now. Check it out:<br><center><img src=http://img37.photobucket.com/albums/v113/stephishott/lovekeyboard.jpg></center>

In other news, tomorrow I am bringing in my camera for the Fitz Hotties communnity...that should be some funny shit there buddy. Tomorrow it is supposed to snow what the fuck is up with that...two to three inches. I wanted to wash my car tomorrow but i guess I cant now.

Woke up and went to eat lunch with Steph, and Stacie, Jackie and Andrew were chillin there so that was pretty cool. Went to 5th hour class and we had the sub that I think wants down my pants i dunno she is crazy. Justin and Jackie made a guest appearance in our class and they almost got busted soo that was pretty funny!Then I met Steph in the hall again and seen her folder and I just wanted to run. I got over it though and went to the pep assembly and I swear thats the only time I ever had fun at one of them things. Then I dropped Steph off at home and visited her one more time before goin to work. Man it was soo funny at work this guy made a huge mistake...he ordered a extra large pizza for himself and them things are like party size and he was like OHHHH Jesus thats a lot of pizza!!! I kinda felt bad for him but he was fat so I'm sure he has no regrets! I shall be going so see ya..."

You don't remember me,
But I remember you.
I lie awake and try so hard,
Not to think of you.
But who (who) can (can) decide,
What they dream ?
And dream I do...
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
Have you forgotten all I know,
And all we had ?
You saw me mourning my love for you,
And touched my hand.
I knew you loved me then.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I look in the mirror and see your face.
If I look deep enough.
So many things inside that are just like you are<br>taking over.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me,
(You're taking over me),
You're taking over me,
(Taking over me), Taking over me.

I try to talk to Stephanie about these things but sometimes I get the feeling that she doesnt understand or maybe I am just being totally irrational. Im a jealous boy I tell ya, super jealous. My jealousy might kill me one day what do you think about that? When Im with Steph I feel great but when we're apart...ohhh boy it can get ugly. I cant handle feeling like this all the time I dont know what to do. MAN im such a whiner. Maybe I dont deserve Steph...theres probably a million guys out there that would be better for her than my stupid ass. Well Im gonna go beat myself up some more and go to bed.."

"event","I've been having such great times lately its sooo great. Stephanie keeps surprising me by randomly showing up at my house, and we just had our three month anniversary, sooooo yA'know. Walkin Steph home is the best times ever I want to do it every nite. We have sooo much fun just walkin down the street what do you think about that? Walking back is a drag though cuz its usually cold and I have no one to warm me up;( Stephs got me hooked on this one song by James Taylor and it makes me cry when I listen to it. She was obsessed with that song a long time ago but Im just now starting to get into it...oh well! Im kinda sad that the green on my tattoo is fading away but I can always get it redid cuz its free and fun lol. I think Im gonna write about a little black kid just for shits and giggles. We were walkin down the street today and this lil nigger wouldnt move out of our way and he was giving me this evil stare like he wanted to throw down or something. I couldnt help but laugh becuase theres no way in the world that a five year old can be a bad ass! Im tempted to write about something else, but that is defintiely not worth my time, effort, or thoughts.

"event","May I just say that this week rocked. Everyone else was on break but I still had school and work so it wasnt much of a break for me huh? Best part of my week was seein Steph like every day and doin a bunch of fun stuff. Then I got my engine in the mail for my truck so thats pretty sweet too! Justin and I have been talkin too so things are going great right now. Lately I've been excited about 50 million things...like I think I want to open up a hobby shop and just work with a bunch of my friends. Im also excited cuz Im savin up and maybe in a year or two Ill have my own place to crash. That would be sweet cuz my parents dont appreciate me comin home at 3 in the mornin lol. I already know what kind of dog Im gonna get and where Im gonna buy my groceries from and eveything! As for school it's actually going alright this semester. Im learning some useful stuff and sometimes I actually look forward to going. I think I might take some entrepuneur and marketing classes cuz that would help when I go to open my shop. I'm looking forward to this summer too because Im gonna be going on sooo many neat trips and Ill be all over the place. At work I find myself making more money and doing less work, so who wouldnt be excited about that!?"

Like punk ass bitches who write that they like Steph on their websites, or anyone else who even looks at her. I guess im just crazy. Anyways tomorrow is Valentines Day and thats just awesome. I'm gonna say a few things about Stephanie for a second. Shes sooo great! Shes just soo loveable and I can't believe she's mine. Every goodbye is harder than the last and that just makes me want to be with her even more. She's like my other half...

Things are gonna get better though cuz I'm going to hang with Steph on all next week. Today was just super gay I guess because of some stupid random things that just kept popping up. Like dumbasses hitting on my girlfriend, or Val getting mad about a random hang out that we barely discussed, or even my dad calling my car a piece of shit because of something he did. What a lovely day huh? Well Im super bored and I never have anything to say on this bad lad so later you freaks..."

"event","Last nite was the concert and it was really freakin sweet. Stephanie and me went to see MXPX, Sugarcult, Motion City Soundtrack and Simple Plan. We started off by cutting in front of every single person that was in line and no one bitched, how cool is that? After a while we got too cold so we gave up our spot in line and went to Hockeytown and I ate these nasty ass chicken pitas that made my breath smell like a sewer. We hung out at Hockeytown for a while and we played this hockey game thing which was totally awesome. When it was time to leave we left and stood outside in this huge ass line which wrapped around like four blocks. Out of nowhere this dude just started walkin down the street in a muscle shirt and I was like ""wow that guy is a bad ass"". After that a limo drove by with a bunch of hookers in it and I told them to fuck off or something like that. We got inside and some dumb black dude tried to take my camera from me cuz your not supposed to have them in there. I was like yeah whatever give it back to me and he did. I'm gettin kinda tired of typin all these details but when we finally got inside the bands were really good and it was neat to be like right in front of them on the main floor. After the concert I turned on this one road and I looked, and I was like man look at that jack ass goin the wrong way. All of a sudden the car turned on its flashers and a cop came over the loud speaker and was like ""turn your piece of shit around and go the other way dumb fuck!!"" I felt so embarassed but I couldnt help but laugh cuz who just does that. I bet Steph didnt think she would have a good time with me but guess what we had a great time so Im really stoked about that. Anyways Im super tired from wakin up early this mornin so I might just go to bed or pop some caps in whitey or something....night everyone!"

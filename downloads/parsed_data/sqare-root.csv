"event","According to the 1/07/04 Financial Times a study conducted by the Army foound that 20% of troops in Iraq, acquire mental health problems. Our total troop involvement in Iraq so far sumes up to about 330,000 soldiers, with about 140,000 troops there right now. Twenty percent of the troops who are luckie enough to come back home safely will not be able to function within their society. How can so many americans be put in harms way for absolutelly no concrete reason?"

"event","So I am in a Grassroots Campaign against the bag searches on the T. Bag searches on the T are stupid for the following reasons:

They are ineffective - Only bags are inspected, attackers can therefore bipass being detected by carrying any weapons on their bodies. Maybe this is missconception, but I was under the impression that suicide bombers usually straped explosives directly to their bodies...

They go against the 14th ammendment - The MBTA is evasive in providing any information about how they will ensure the searches are random. There is therefore no guarantee that people of Islamic or African descent won't be targeted. I understand that there might be some concern that revealing their selection mechanism might be a security threat, but if it reall IS random then it wouldn't be.

They go against the 4th ammendment - A random search is by deffinition a search done without reasonable couse. This is unconstitutional according to the 4th ammendment. Some might argue that we already give up our 4th ammendment rights at airports or even in some schools. In response I would point out that the MBTA is a PUBLIC transit system. On April 17th 2000 the supreme court ruled that officers could not even ""squeeze the carry-on luggage of public transit passengers in searching for contraband without a warrant or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity."" Looking through bags seems like much more of a violation of privacy.




In conclusion the searches are ineffective, unfair, and unconstitutional. I ask all of you to get involved in fighting this ridiculous policy. Contact me about joining the TRU or start protesting on your own.

peace out"

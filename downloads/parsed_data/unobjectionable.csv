"event","I've been back at home for almost 7 months now, and I've been really bad about keeping in touch with people back at New College.  Some people have been contacting me about my bad-friendliness, and now I feel like I need to get back in contact with my college roots.  

I miss New College in that I miss having access to a lot of cool people in very close proximity.  At home, most of my friends are away at college or live really far south in Chicago, so I don't have a ton of social interaction.  School is a million times easier at the little state school that is basically just a step above community college, but now I'm working a real part-time job as a bank teller, so that kind of monopolizes my time.  I like it a lot, but it's definitely not something I want to do for the rest of my life, mostly due to the fact that the pay is crap.  I really just want to finish college, but they're making me take all these gen eds and minor classes that are going to delay me for a while.  It's better than going back to New College, paying 7+ times as much per semester, and having to write a thesis plus do 3 ISPs, though.

I just want to get a cushy job so that I can take vacations to see everyone around the country whom I've lost touch with, pay off my student loans and move out of my parents' house.

Speaking of my parents' house, they're still not done with construction so we're still living in an apartment.  I didn't mind it at first, but now I'm so incredibly sick of this place.  I also really miss being somewhat independent back in Sarasota.  I really enjoyed living away from home, and I probably won't be doing it again until it's financially responsible for me to do so.  That won't be for some time.  I really hope I'm not 30 and still living at home.

Anyway, that's the end of my rambling.  I think I'm going to try to visit Sarasota next semester, so whoever will still be around and would like to see me should be prepared.  And someone should offer me their floor."

i feel so good about this semester; i'm doing more work than i have since the beginning of first year.  but it's almost like there seriously are not hours in the day anymore.

<lj-cut text=""i like a lot of things (including this meme)"">

<b>accents</b>: I like my Chicago twang. I like speaking in accents that are not my own. I like when people use accents different from my own, whether they are real or not.  Basically, I like everything about accents.

<b>Annie Hall</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.culturevulture.net/Movies/anniehall3b.jpg"">
I first saw Annie Hall about a year and a half ago at a friend's house, and I laughed out loud at almost every single joke.  I have yet to see it or any other Woody Allen movie again, but I enjoyed that one time thoroughly.

<b>Battle of Algiers</b>: 
<img src=""http://216.168.37.61/posteritati/jpg/B4/BATTLE%20OF%20ALGIERS%201SH%2004.jpg"">
This is simply an amazing film.  It was commissioned by the Algerian government to show both sides of the Algerian revolution.  The film itself definitely has more sympathy for the Algerians, but it portrays the French in a mostly positive light.  It looks like a documentary, but everything was scripted, based on true events.  If this isn't my absolute favorite movie ever, it's pretty close.  

<b>card playing</b>: 
I liked playing cards long before I went to Baton Rouge, but the summer made it an obsession.  Now, if anyone ever asks me to play a card game I like (including but not limited to euchre, setback, spades, sheepshead, asshole, crazy eights, klabberjass, gin, bridge, canasta, cribbage, Phase 10, war, Set, blitz, Uno...), I will play immediately with no regard to what I'd been doing previously.  Moreover, card games will forever remind me of Michelle, Anthony, Nee, Rachel, Daniel and all the others, and at very least for this reason, they will always have a special place in my heart.

<b>diesel sweeties</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.dieselsweeties.com/hstrips/0/0/0/1/00010.png"">
I was really into a few online comics for a while, and this was one of them.  It's about the future where robots and humans mix freely and have inter-whatever relationships.  It's "" indie "".  I dunno.  I think it's gotten progressively worse since Maura and Clango broke up.  I still read it a few times a week, but not every day.  It's located <a href=www.dieselsweeties.com>here</a>.

<b>French</b>: When it came time for me to pick a language in high school, I really wanted to take Italian, but my school didn't offer it.  So I decided to take Japanese or Chinese, but neither worked with my schedule.  French seemed like a better choice than Spanish, German or Latin.  I'm really glad that I ended up taking it and that I'm taking it again now.  I think the inherent snottiness is part of the charm.  I always feel like I'm in some elite club when I'm speaking French.

<b>Harvey Pekar</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.thecomical.com/images/the_last_supper_lg.jpg"">
I first found out about Harvey from watching American Splendor (which is also awesome).  He was a record and comics junkie, working as a file clerk, when he got fed up and started writing comics about his everyday life.  His friend, R. Crumb (a noted underground comic artist), offered to do the graphics for his comics.  Pretty quickly, Harvey became an underground comic god.  Since seeing the movie, I've read some of his books and found them funny and relatable.  Everyone should check out his stuff/American Splendor.

<b>Karaoke Revolution</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.realgamer.co.uk/screenshots/2_10.jpg"">
This game is so fun.  It's like Dance Dance Revolution, except for singing.  I'm pretty good, which makes it even better.  The only problem is that there are only like 35 songs per version of the game, so you run through them pretty fast.  Regardless, it's awesome.

<b>Monkeys</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.fireassault.com/monkeys2/files/screenshots/ka-zar.jpg"">
This is a movie some guys from my high school made for a film class.  It's about space monkeys that are trying to gain world domination by taking over people's bodies and then destroying stuff.  It's better than it sounds.  The sequel, Monkeys 2, is even better (the image above is from Monkeys 2).  They're both available for purchase <a href=http://www.fireassault.com/monkeys.html>here</a>.

<b>Nino Quincampoix</b>:
<img src=""http://amelielefilm.online.fr/persos/photos/nino3.jpg"">
Nino is the guy Amelie falls for in her movie.  I'm kinda over Jeunet's cutesy, overprecious direction and the immense popularity of the film among people who think they're artsy because they like Amelie, but I never get sick of Nino (or Amelie herself, for that matter).

<b>proofs</b>:Being able to prove stuff is definitely true (based on axioms) is the best part of doing math.  I couldn't give less of a crap about numbers or functions or any of that stuff.  Doing proofs is where it's at.

<b>Rilo Kiley</b>:
<img src=""http://moviepoopshoot.com/abouttown/images/2004/jan23/rilo_kiley.jpg""> 
Kate introduced me to Rilo Kiley about two or three years ago.  They make melodic, poppy music.  I like them, but not as much as some other people I know.  Their first album is a lot better than the third but not as good as the second.  I wish they'd mix it up more and try new things.  But Blake was in the Nickelodeon classic show ""Salute Your Shorts""!

<b>shoulder rests</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.primoviolins.com/bearpawmusic/kun2.JPG"">
I played the viola for about 10 years, but I've touched it once since coming to college, when I broke a string trying to tune it.  I don't know if I could even play the viola without a shoulder rest anymore.  It makes it infinitely more comfortable and helps you hold the neck up.  Yep.

<b>The Cubs</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.rassi.com/images/wrigley-field.jpg""> 
Being from Chicago and especially being from my family, baseball is very important to me.  I really get caught up in the Cubs; each game seems extremely important, even in the beginning of the season.  I'm not completely convinced that they're out of this season's playoffs yet, even though they're 5.5 games back in the wild card race with only twenty games left, which means that if the sum of the number of their losses and the Astros wins reaches 15, they're eliminated.  They've still got seven games with the Astros, so anything could happen, although there are 3 teams in between them and Houston.

<b>Twelve Angry Men</b>: 
<img src=""http://www.kroaibo.no/UserFiles/Image/film/12EidsvorneMenn.jpg""> 
If you don't know why this movie is awesome, go rent it right now. (the Henry Fonda  version, not the '90s one!)

<b>Yves Montand</b>: 
<img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a3/Yves.jpg""> 
He was a French actor who did a bunch of French movies.  He was also in a few English language movies, but none of this is why I know him.  He has a song on the Rushmore soundtrack, and on a whim one day, I downloaded all the music from him that I could find.  He's a less masculine Frank Sinatra who sings in French.  I like 'im a lot.

The end.  Do the meme; it's fun, especially with pictures!

You like things edgy, subtle, and smart. I guess that means you're

I hate it, but I think that has a lot to do with the fact that I looooved my last haircut. I dunno, it'll probably end up being ok, but right now, I want to rewind time 9 hours.

I feel too lazy to post more.  I'm going to be posting daily in a Louisiana blog starting Sunday, but I won't give you the link right now, because it's not ready.  

I never thought I'd be so bummed about a haircut.

"event","I feel a lot better today.  The chest congestion seems to have gotten worse, but the cough is increasingly less frequent and as such, my throat doesn't hurt as much.  Luckily for me, what makes me most noticeably sick right now is my voice.  When I start talking, I sound mostly fine, maybe a little sick, but then after about 5 seconds, it suddenly drops out completely and I'm whispering.  It's pretty fun, so I've been sitting here for about 10 minutes saying things like ""When is going to drop out?  When is going to <small>drop out?  <i>There</i> it goes.</small>.  Sometimes I get that low grumbly voice that is characteristic of sick people too.  I'm amused by the constant changes, and if you've got the time, you should take a chance to witness it.

I didn't get much work done last night, and I went back to sleep after turning my alarm off at 6 am.  Really, I should be over in the fishbowl again working on my music theory projects, but I'm still waking up, and the piano will still be there in 10 minutes.  Now that my sick story is believable (because it was true), I really need to finish those projects so that I have something to show him today."

I'm almost definitely going to take the bolded classes and the italicized classes are the other ones I really want to take.  I'll probably end up in Math Seminar too, at least fall semester, since I'm doing my REU this summer.  I should really take Physics I and II, but I may not have time and I really don't want to.

Thinking about next semester makes me happy.  Why won't this semester just end?"

"event","I slept until noon today.  This is insanely late for me.  I think the latest I've ever slept before was probably 10:15-ish.  Unfortunately, I had class at 12:30, and I proceeded to lock myself out while getting ready, before grabbing shoes and my bag.  I ended up being 20 minutes late to class.  

It's been a really frustrating couple of days.  I want to go home, where I don't have any responsibilities."

I was really worried about it because she just kept cutting and she blow dried it really messily in the beginning, but it came out well.  I'm a little anxious about how it'll look tomorrow when I just take a shower and leave it to air dry, but if it's really bad, I guess I'll just have to start blow drying it myself.

In other news, my break has been good, but not very productive.  I had an urge to go back to school today, but I'm glad that I'm staying until Sunday.  Hopefully, I will get more productive and actually catch up with my homework, like I had planned."

"event","I accepted the LSU REU.  After hearing a bunch of maybes and ""can't tell you right now""s, I decided that the safest option was the best.  The fact that I started getting super excited right after I decided to take it makes me feel that I made the right decision.  Here's to hoping that I'm not too dumb for this and that the projects aren't boring!"

LSU campus housing and you will be eligible for reimbursement of 
actual travel expenses up to $350. This funding is provided through a 
grant from the National Science Foundation entitled ``Mathematical

So, yay, I have an option, but boo, they want me to reply by Thursday.  I haven't even gotten a yes or no from anybody else and may not get anything until after Thursday.  I just think it's unreasonable for them to ask me to decide this quickly.  I'm sure that they want to be able to fill the places of people who decline before other REUs grab them up, but I dunwanna have to decide so soon.

Then again, the project (Toric Varieties, Ihara Zeta Functions of Graphs, Braids and Knot Theory) sounds fun.  I actually had assumed I wouldn't get this one, since I haven't had any topology and it seemed like you would need a little to do their program.  Otherwise, there aren't many pluses.  The stipend and other amenities are pretty much the standard for REUs, and LSU isn't exactly known as a pillar of knowledge.  I just wish Eirini would get back to me and make this decision at least a little easier.

I am tired.  Early bed time tonight, methinks."

"event","My dad's talking about getting me a car for next year again.  I don't want to get my hopes up again, but I think that it's more plausible this year because I will have money (current refund check, prospective stipend from REU) to pay for insurance.  It would have to be nice enough to get me from Chicago to Sarasota, since that's one of the things he's proposing.  And it'd be super duper awesome to have a car for concerts, possible Disney trips and other nonboredom.  

Ok, so maybe I am getting my hopes up.

In other news, I just helped choose the orientation planner and RA selection committee.  Dan Sarkissian will be the former and the latter is now composed of Paolo, Adesh, Kristin Psiaki, Shannon Benge and Brian Ellison, in case you were wondering.  I really enjoyed the meetings, especially the RA selection.  I didn't think that I was going to run for some NCSA position for next year, but I really do enjoy being involved, so I'm reconsidering.  I barely ever say anything at meetings, but I feel that I would say more if the ""Residence Life Rep"" had more responsibilities.  Or any responsibilities.

In any case, I'm in a good mood, despite the fact that I did almost none of the things I wanted to do this weekend.  Fun meetings and 2 new Arrested Development episodes starting in about 10 minutes, woo hoo!

P.S. Charissa, I am seriously addicted to buffalo wings now.  It's been less than two days since I last had them, and already I am craving them again.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to you, Charz!"

"event","I just came from what was most likely my first failed math exam ever.  I feel like shit.  Whenever I do worse than I should have on a math test, I really question whether or not I should be devoting my life to this stuff.  I know it's not really reasonable, since I missed the class where he talked about the things I didn't get (which was like half the exam), and that I haven't been keeping up with my work, studying hard enough, going to him with questions, etc.  The exam wasn't bad.  I felt relatively prepared.  But I wasn't, at all, really.  I feel like I'm doomed to repeat this ad infinitum.  It happened last semester with Calc III, and it feels like it will continue to happen now.

I don't know.  I feel really dumb right now.  I'm in the library, avoiding my room because it symbolizes applications and homework and grading that has to be finished, and I want to avoid anything like math for as long as possible, right now."

1. Pick a dozen movies that are ones that you have special feelings about.

1. There's an old joke. Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says, ""Boy, the food at this place is really terrible."" The other one says, ""Yeah, I know, and such small portions."" Well, that's essentially how I feel about life. Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.

"event","I woke up this morning at 4:30.  Not really sure why, but I speculate that it has a large amount to do with the fact that my room was incredibly hot when I awoke.  That doesn't really ring true for me, though, because I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, and something like that would not generally wake me up.  Anyway, I wasn't able to get back to sleep, so I'm sure I'll be incredibly groggy all day. 

Being at school doesn't feel like being at school.  I hate ISP.  I emailed Eirini about doing an ISP on polyominoes.  Sounds incredibly crappy, but it's something, it's valid, and it'll probably be easy.

<lj-cut text=""some not so cool pictures of my break"">

we had a real christmas tree for the first time in at least ten years:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/6e29898e.jpg"">


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_8969.jpg"">
white christmas!!


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_8970.jpg"">
this is where I live.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_8971.jpg"">
this was formerly known as my car, now known as megan's car.  note the awesome black hood, which was installed after I killed it right before starting college.


<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_8985.jpg"">
here's megan telling me ""no pictures"" at a gas station on our way to spring grove for the big family christmas party.

and then there are no pictures of my family christmas party, because I'm not used to taking pictures at those type of things, and the few pictures I did take were immediately deleted because they sucked.  so you'll just have to trust me when I say that I have adorable cousins and that the annual family game was super fun and funny.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9011.jpg"">
on the way home, I took a picture of joe.

here are megan and joe in their natural habitat, our home:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9012.jpg"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9013.jpg"">


a few days later, I really wanted to take some pictures, but it was like 11 o'clock, so it was dark, and nobody was up to pose for me, so I took a bunch of pictures of myself.  this had the added bonus of showcasing my newly cut and straightened hair.  it's unlikely that you'll ever see my hair this straight again.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9042.jpg"">
of course, I never have a straight face.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9043.jpg"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9044.jpg"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9070.jpg"">
I am shocked how straight my hair is!


then I took some shots from above like all the really hip emo kids do:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9072.jpg"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9076.jpg"">


Then I took my glasses off and shot the camera an ""I'm super hot"" look:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9110.jpg"">


after which I noticed my messy dresser in the background:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9113.jpg"">


so I took a picture of some more of my mess:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9052.jpg"">


then I got tired, so I turned off the light and told the camera to be quiet...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9116.jpg"">


and went to sleep.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v204/eileeeeeeeeeeeeeen/100_9130.jpg"">

which is probably what I'm gonna do now."

<lj-cut text=""calc evaluation"">
 This course was a solid introduction to vector calculus. The text for
the course was ""Calculus: Early Transcendentals,"" Fifth Edition, by
James Stewart. The course covered chapters 12-16 of the text. This
included an introduction to vectors and the geometry of space (dot
products, vector products, lines, planes, cylinders and quadric
surfaces), vector valued functions, the standard material concerning
partial derivatives (including tangent plane approximations, the chain
rule, max/min problems and Lagrange multipliers), multiple integrals,
vector fields, line integrals, curl, divergence, Green's Theorem,
surface integrals and the Divergence Theorem (hurricanes precluded
covering the material on Stokes' Theorem). The class met three times
per week for lecture and once per week for a voluntary problem
session. There were three in-class exams and weekly (roughly) homework
assignments. The evaluation is based on student exam performance.

Your homework performance for the semester was satisfactory.

Your performance on the first exam was strong and indicated a working
knowledge of all the material central to the course. In particular,
you did excellent work on the problem involving lines and planes, the
problem involving vector algebra, problem involving surfaces, curves
and tangent plane constructions, and the problem concerning partial
differentiation and Laplace's equation. Your work on the problem
involving limits and continuity for functions of several variables was
not as strong, but indicated no serious problems. All told, this was
a very good performance.

Your performance on the second exam, while marred by some small
computational mistakes, was solidly satisfactory. You did solid work
on the material involving classification of critical points and the
material involving Lagrange multipliers. Your work on double
integrals contained a number of computational errors, but it appears
that you know the material. Your work on triple integrals was mixed:
you were able to set up the required integrals in Euclidean and
cylindrical coordinates, but you had some trouble with spherical
coordinates and with changing the order of integration. All told,
this performance indicated that you were familiar with the main topics
being examined.

Your performance on the final exam was satisfactory. You did solid
work on the material involving the computation of divergence and curl
for given vector fields and the material involving the construction of
a potential for a given conservative field. You correctly stated and
applied Green's Theorem. You made a serious computational error on
the problem involving line integrals. While you were able to
correctly state the Divergence Theorem, you had trouble applying it
(the surface integral seems to have given you trouble). All told,
your performance indicated mastery of the core material of the
semester, save the computation of surface integrals.

Given the above, I find your performance for the semester to be
clearly satisfactory. I encourage you to continue your studies of
mathematics and I look forward to working more with you in the future. 



nothing that says that i did no homework second mod!  no actual scores!  really, this is the best I could have hoped for.  i feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  i will enjoy the rest of my break much more now.

"event","it's amazing how easily one can get reaccustomed to temperatures.  it's 37 degrees outside and i don't even feel that cold.  

thanksgiving break's been pretty good.  on thursday, we had my dad's side of the family (23 people) over at my house.  it was nice seeing all my aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents.  then, my aunt, her boyfriend, my sister and i went to see sideways, which i liked a lot.  then on friday, my mom and i went out to best buy   to get me a wireless card, because they were only 20 dollars with a router.  amazingly, there were still some there and the lines weren't too bad.  i also ordered new glasses, but they won't come in until monday, so i won't get them until i come back for winter break.  

today, my mom and i went to Jewel (it's a grocery store) and got me some food to take back in place of the clothes that i'm not taking back.  i figure i'll bring about 15 shirts, since i'll be back in Sarasota for only 12 more days after Sunday.  then, my whole immediate family went to another thanksgiving party, for my mom's side of the family (probably 20-something people too).  it was a bunch of fun, because one of my cousin has a 4 year old and a 6 year old and my uncle has 2 year old twins and a 4 year old.  they were so cute, and the little ones are just starting to be ok away from mom and dad. 

now that we're home,  i should either be packing or doing homework.  and yet I am here, updating livejournal and being lazy.  eh, packing took me like 5 minutes when I packed for coming here, and the homework will all get done some time.  right now, I'm super duper comfortable and do not plan on getting up any time soon."

"event","So, I passed my calc test.  Pat said that the scores were mostly in the 43%-78% range and passing was 50%, and I got a 74%.  I'm happy, because I basically crammed 7 weeks of learning into three and a half hours, but I still have a lot of regret about how seriously I've taken that class this mod.  There's really no excuse for it.  The material didn't get much more difficult.  I may have started the mod with more work than I knew what to do with, but that changed as the weeks went by.  I'm really frustrated with myself right now.  I feel like I'm lapsing back into my high school habits, and that's definitely undesirable.  I wish I would just be diligent with my work, no matter how boring.  It is very important for me to not only pass the calculus and pass it with flying colors, but also to impress Pat.  I've been writing my evaluation in my head, and it's just not very good.  And it's all my fault.  Sure, the overabundance of physics problems he does in class bore me to tears.  Sure, the homework tends to be monotonous.  But it still <b>must</b> be done.  So this weekend, I'm going to do all the assignments I haven't formally done and turn them in on Monday to the TA's box or something.  I don't know if it will help the homework portion of my evaluation, since some of it will be <i>extremely</i> late, but it'll make me feel better about my level of commitment to the class and it will help insure that I understand the material.  Done and done."

I helped the little guy out, taking him in my hand and putting him back down on the ground.

But how did he get up there?  Either this mouse has acrobatic skills and bravado that it has yet to explicity  exhibit or someone put him up there.  And that's fucked up.  In addition, they seem constantly terrified.  

Poor mice.  We should just let them run around and do whatever they want.  They seem really antsy about being cooped up."

"event","hi. i'm updating because a certain Sean (H) is making me. He is good.  uuuuuuummmmmmm he is extremely hot and buff.  I like him because he's nice to me. sometimes he gives me butterflys and make my face turn a bright shade of pink. I think this is normal. He also has this red bmw he likes to drive me in and occasionally lets me take the wheel because I'm just such a great driver. His voice is pretty kind of like his eyes. He also lives very close to me and that is a good thing. Meerly 2 miles. Sean is not my boyfriend butuuuuuuummmmmm know that if you're a jealous boy because he's probably better than you...don't fuck with him or he'll beat you up and stuff cause he's a skin or something like that. Did I mention he's Irish? yeah well incase I didn't....he's Irish. yup. He's also a funny guy. he makes me giggle and stuff. yeah...Sean is good.

Sincerely,
Mona."

I know alot of you are excited and ready for school, but I havn't even touched nor thought about any of the summer reading, or all that other ""homework"" bullshit Pali gave us. This summer has been <b>the sex</b> and it blows hard to say it's pretty much over.

Another thing, why don't you people comment! There are like a selected bunch of lovely people who do comment, thank you, but for those of you who don't...if you're going to bother to read my life in journal form...the least you can do is comment...about anything. Except for the occasional asshole who likes to post shit anonymously thinking I actually care about what they have to say....'cause they're really cool like that. But it would make me go like this ---> :) or this ----> <3 if you say something nice to me. I know I'm being a tad hippocritical, cause I don't necessarily comment on your journal, but if you take the time to...I will glady return the favor. <s>i will love you forever if you do.</s> You will be my friend.


the end.
oh yeah...and proof that i own:

"event","I can be a hippocrit. 
but so can you. 
Even more ways than one. 
with my friends, my actions. I'll admit that. 
Even if no one has brought it to my attention.
I'll be hostile enough to share this. 
I'm a shit-talker. 
but isn't everyone?
If there's something that I don't like about you,
I will talk about it behind your back.
Just like you'd do the same to me.
and if word gets out,
 we'll bitch and complain...
but I'll be your friend anyway.
And I'll do some fucked up things,
Cause I hate your face
But I'll still have my reasons.
It's the age. I'd say. None of us are the 'she's such a sweet girl' or 'he's such a great guy'
we may be cut out to be.
girls are mean.. boys are meaner. 
And I will make wrong decisions.
But I'm only having fun.
not too much fun. But just enough to get by.

I'm not a bad friend,
A bad girlfriend I could have been
but the enphysis in the word 'girlfriend' is 'friend'
so give me the chance to be your 'friend'and I may not be 
so bad in the end. Because after all....""boyfriend and girlfriend"" is only a title..so as for titles..I can be anything you want."

<P>then after summer school i went to laurens malibu beach house which is right on the shore and it was great. mishana, diana, charlotte, danielle, amanda, rusty, larson, astor, neema and alex goodman were all there. oh and of course laurens darling brothers and sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;we had such a good time, i had 4 red-bulls and then we were all just playing in the water and chilling on their like private beach area and like in the beach house playing around and stuff. it was really great. and redbull.</P>

on sunday my parents had a party for my brother (and i?s) graduation. some of my friends were here and my brothers friends and we were all just playing around and it was really silly and then amanda slept over and it was fun(ny) and then charlotte later joined us and then today we took a walk in my neighborhood and we messed around bucks house and then left cause  he had to go golfing with his brother and then we played around my neighbors house and then we took a bus into town (palisades) and we ate and then came back home. and then everyone left and now i am here. and oh i got my summer school schedule for pali:


1.HEALTH - ACKERMAN
2. LIFE SKILLS - CASTRO

yesterday - nicoles pool party in the morning...not much happenin there, left to victorias pool party...that was cool hung out with like everyone and all the girls, and all the boys, but for some reason the boys and the girls wont hang out together cause everyone is gay. but it was alot of fun and then after i went to pali graduation for my brother and hung out with charlotte and jenny and ashara and megan and nasser some, and saw alot of people and stuff.

today - THE SEX.
started with going to natalies pool party. geoff was there, + everyone else. oh oh and i saw sean from mayas party and he's so cute we totally sexed it not really but i love him, he's great. and alot of other people were there uuuh there was a game of spin the bottle. it was funny. it died. oh and some of jumped in the pool with our clothes on and some of us didnt have our clothes on and then me geoff and maya took a shower together. and alot of my favorite people were there...like everyone. and it was alot of <s>fun</s>sex.

AFTER PARTY - so me and geoff decide to get to century city somehow...we walked like 5 miles to a bus, then took two busses to century and finally made it and met up with cameron. century city was the worst ever, no one was there and it was stupid so we left and start walking to dianas and then cameron gets picked up and then me and geoff go to dianas lobby and just sit and lay  there for a reaaaaaallly long time being reeeeeallly emo and it was sex, and then we decided to get even more emosexual so we go out by dianas pool and sit under a staircase for like past midnight and it was really <s>nice.</s>emo and then we went back in the lobby to just dangle around somemore and then it was like almost 1 am and geoffs mom comes to pick him up and i go upstairs to dianas and then left. and the end."

"event","my computer is finally fixed. so i can finally update. here are the highlights of my week.

tuesday - went to yo la tengo with henry. it was fucking amazing, as expected. me and henry met them and got signed posters and t-shirts and yeah. its really cool how there is only 3 of them yet they can alternate playing all the instruments. i expected them to play the mellow rock that was expected, but i thought it was totally cool how they like raped our ears with their SCREECHING solo's. it was pretty.

friday - grad night at disneyland. i sat with heather and rusty and his friend on the bus. at disneyland i hung out with diana, alex, charlotte, nasser, and danelle, oh and emily too for sometime. it was alot of fun. we went on alot of rides and i played like 6 rounds of ddr with black girls. and um me alex and charlotte watched the fireworks. it was cool. 

saturday - dianas house and then alex came and then charlotte and jenny and we all went to the fairburn fair but then me and alex walked back to dianas house and played there until everyone came back. and then when everyone was home (+ johnny) we all took a bus to the prominade. and they went to the beach and i seperated to meet up with luke

luke and i had a really good time, for those of you who were wondering. we saw raising hellen and walked down to the beach and sat in the sand and then went back to the prominade and met up with people and hung out and ummm stuff.

"event","since i can't sleep. i've decided to tell you about my weekend. so far. 
friday - i went to amandas house and then jazmyn picked us up and we all went to jays party. it was cool i had my fun(x2) hahaha met cool people, hung out, saw people i havnt talk to in while, had a chance to bond with someone and um yeah. it was nice

saturday - went to asharas house and we got our nails done and then went to emilys early to hang out with nicky and megan.  the party was funn slippery velvet was good, half of half nelson was good, um met some more really cool people, everyone was getting wasted and fucked up and it was great. 

sunday - went to the prominade with ashara and with our luck, we (well actually mostly SHE) got busted by the cops for..doing something. i got lucky, but she got lucky too because they didn't arrest her or give her a citation or anything and let her go, but theyre probably gonna find out more and i'm scared of the out-comes. so anyway, ashara really did not want to stay at the promenade but i did....so she left and took the bus down to emilys and thats when i saw LUKE. and we said hi and talked for a really long time and took a walk and it was really nice and he asked me out tonight. yay im SO happy. he is such a great guy, he's got all the qualities. and i hope it remains that way. 

tommorow - i think im going to ashara wants me to come to her block party thing to harass mikey, and then going to westside pavillion with ashara and/or diana to get a graduation dress. OR i might just hang out with luke.

"event","saturday i ended up going to asharas house. which might i add was so fucking amusing. we did so much shit. literally. we just hung out around playa del rey the whole day and met up with people and harassed people and at night we were outside this wedding of black and mexican people and there was like these 2 black guys and 2 mexican girls who we were fucking with/fucking with us. and it was the fucking funniest thing that's ever happened to me. they were accusing us of being so fucked up on drugs and at the same time trying to buy some off of us. we had them convinced we were like 11 and then we had them convinced we were 16. and omg it was just TOO FUCKING FUNNY. we were like messing with the mexican chicks and they thought we were like run-away fucked up teens on the street. which we were. but anyway then we went back to asharas house at like 11:30 at night after wandering the streets that whole day. 

on sunday, i woke up. and then someone said something that was like so depressing to hear and i cried. and was ""emo"" and then i went to mishanas house to work on our project for stolper. we're doing ""the back scratcher"" we're almost done. and we just palyed on her computer like making movies and stuff. and then we were looking through her pictures but they were more like porn. and now im home and shitty again because of loss of entertainment, but atleast i have alex to talk to.

im missing ..something?...someone?....somehow.

"event","death cab for cutie was fucking amazing. molly and i went together and we met up with henry and his really nice/cool friend lily, and geoff and his friend, and katie and her friend lauren. the concert was SO great. i climaxed, i cried, and i was like shaking. they were so beautiful and all the songs they played were great. i don't think death cab has like a single bad song. they are SO cute and funny. the opening act was a band from NY called ""+/-"" (plus minus) they were okay i wasn't feeling them that much they weren't that talented or original but the drummer was really good. after the concert henry lily molly and i went to mc donalds and ate and then henrys mom took us to henrys where molly and i got picked up. i hope i go to the next death cab show because they were absolutely wonderful. i even got a bootleg t-shirt after the show

"event","and i have nothing. i am nothing no longer. shut up, you say? no. because for the record...i <i>need</i>a boyfriend. by the end of the week, if possible. you need one too? that's nice. i've heard it enough from you. now it's my turn to speak. ""you don't <i>need</i> anything, mona."" but am i happy? you keep telling me ""don't worry mona, you'll find him, he will come."" and i wish it was that easy. it takes me around 6 months at a time to the right ""him"" and everyone in between all that is stupid and worthless.  ""but you always have a boyfriend mona"" not any more! i never do. those boys don't count. i need someone who i really like. someone who makes me feel truely infatuated and who can keep me smiling even when im not with him. can you do that? i didn't think so. <b>why must all significant lovers turn into <i>in</i>significant others.</b> everytime i get what i want, i can't hold on to it. i need to learn to loosen my mind into a tighter grip. teach me how? everytime i come out of a relationship i change. i change for the better, and sometimes for the worse. and this time? i don't know..you decide. <i><b>but as for me i'm coming to my final failure i've killed myself with changes trying to make it better  but i still ended up becoming something other than what i had planned to be.</i></b> he's wrecked me. no, not <i>him</i>, but everyone. why do i keep doing this to myself? i don't know. why do we all do this to ourselfs? maybe it's worth the while. maybe not. a short period of happiness leads to longer periods of sadness.  and always leaves a semi-permanent feeling deep inside you, when youre all alone and thinking about nothing and everything,  suddenly the feeling hits you again and all you can do is but shed tears and then try to forget. but what happens when you cant forget? and you cant sleep it off? no more drinking till you pass out,  and <b> when comfort food has lost his comfort. </b>  ""get over it""? you say? yaeh i'll get over it, eventually. but what is there to do in the mean-while? <b>i need a boyfriend.</b>

...or a hobby. :-/

comment if you feel me. i don't need to hear anything like, ""aaw mona don't worry..."" though it was greatly appreciated. and sure, it made me feel good at first, but it's not working anymore. after someone telling me i'd find him, and when i finally did, i lost him...those words mean nothing. now, i know you wanta boyfriend too. we just gotta be stronger and try harder. because as for me, the little things like ex boyfriends, and the damned one night stands i keep getting myself into... keep piling up sinking me to the bottem. <i><b> but we'll all float on</i></b>


you make me emo.

"event","hi. so today my day started out pretty crappy, my friends messed up my plans and such. and i lost my wallet. it didn't have that much money in it....actually it did. but whatever. i decided to leave school at 3rd period.  so later that day  i ended up going  to sonia's house and there was lindsey, courtney, sammy, and julia. and then max victor miles and grant came and we took a bus to westside, met up with cameron, and then took a bus to the prominade. i hung out with like...alot of different people. not including jay. (long story). uh anyway i saw alot of people there that i did not want to see, and i saw alot of people that i did want to see. i saw some people i havnt seen in a long time. talk to some boy friends. mm-hmm. i even hung out with emily and we had our fun. hahahah. <--we gatta hit that shit again. 
something else that crosed my mind was i don't even like the prominade that much... i don't even know why i still go there. it can be fun with your friends and all...but im really fed up with the whole ""private school crowd(s)"" i mean, don't get me wrong...alot of them are my friends, and i'm not being judgemental to the people i don't know... but alot of them are all rich and good-looking, and they use that their advantages. and they're all like ""scene-kids"" and all ""musicians"" and they like...do stuff. alot of stuff. im probably just thinking of some people imparticular. so don't get offended by anything i say. cause alot of the private school kids are like. cool. bye.

"event","I love Liz. A lot. Times a bunch. Plus infinity.

Homecoming was tons o' fun. I got to eat with Liz, and dance later. Yes, I actually danced, as bad as it was. I'm glad Liz doesn't really care.

Umm, not much else has happened. Just hanging out, seeing Liz, myspacing, soccer conditioning. Fun stuff, especially with Liz.

Done.

I LOVE YOU LIZ. 
(Our kids are going to be so cool.)"

"event","Well, today I am going to church with Liz. And then I'm going to go to her house and watch a movie and help her move stuff. Fun. Well at least the movie part. And my head doesn't hurt anymore, which is great. I hate feeling bad. Hmm, what else?

I love Liz. Like times one-thousand-bagillion-million-trillion. Really. I do. That much. And then some. Well, i'm out."

"event","First entry. It's Bryant, still the same old one from before, just a new account. Still 17. Still Taken. Now a senior. 

Well, I guess I'll post again when I need to vent or something, later.

Love you Liz."

The sun is up but the moon is down, without the light of the sun, the moon can not shite white, nor is it visible to the human eye. give space, but do not loose orbit, for the sun is the energy of all that lives, the light that blinds."

"event","<P>Yesterday me and lewis decided to go to London to see Strapping Young Lad at the Astoria. Decided driving down would be best as there is pretty much no way home from london after a gig. So planned the journey with the aid of some internet map thing that turned out to be aload of bollox. ended up getting lost in london for a while. at one stage we thought we was gonna miss the show and was thinking of just heading home...but we made it. The show was intense, a great set.&nbsp; Had a right laugh, my bro tagged along too cos he was bored. hes into punk music so the gig pretty much ruined his life.hahahah.Beecher supported...they were incredible.&nbsp;anyways here s the pics.</P>

<P>I missed it good...sad but so true. hahaha.</P>
<P>Not been up to much really. Had a ""<FONT size=2>quiet</FONT>"" weekend at berkshore. few people came round, was good to see them. Had a bbq on the park also in the day. Got hella wasted and watched some dvds and talked and talked for hours. i love my friends...i really do.</P>
<P>Oldy has now got a proper nice guitar and an even better amp to play it through, sounds lush. Him and Lewis have been jamming lots recently. I was there today almost got a song together, im really excited even though i have had little input so far. We have limits at the moment, but ideas flow like a river when we put our heads together, it seems like we are thinking the same things, in it for the same reasons, same taste in music etc. i dont care if we ever get a couple more guys to get a full band, just hanging out writing music is so good. </P>
<P>Saw Lauren on sunday, that was cool, hadnt seen her for like 2 weeks, she is hella busy with her exams and stuff at the mo' shes gonna do dead good no doubt. was nice just to hang out and talk all night, be stupid, do stupid stuff, sing along to the most <STRONG>RANDOM</STRONG> music videos. had a great laugh.</P>

"event","<P>So...yesterday me, Oldy and Lewis planned to go out and about and take some snaps. We didnt have any ideas of where to go, but en route to picking up oldy me and lewis noticed the five cooling towers of a power station. See them everytime i go to oldys and think....that would be good to take pictures of. So we went to oldys and he mentioned it also and we decided to go down and get as close as possible to take some pictures.....We got there and confirmed our theory that it was abandoned and not in use. So, we decided to break in to get some wicked pictures.</P>
<P>It was so sureal being in there. you could tell the place hadnt been in use for decades. The odd piece of litter told us that we wasnt the only people to break in recently. To get in we parked the car at the main gate where there was lots of warning signs telling us that it was ""patroled by security"" and under 24 hour cctv surveilence. Turns out there was no security and only one camera which was pointing at my car as it happens. we walked round the metal fence and then into a farmers field in which we randomly heard BAG-PIPES...crazy farmer.....there was some wire fencing which had come down so we just climed through that. The land was really open, only the 5 cooling towers remian. There was some piles of rubble further away which could have been offices and the rest of the power station. In the distance we could see masses of pilons and electrical jumble, i think they were still active, we could hear humming comming from them. We actually discoved it was possible to get inside the cooling towers too, that was amazing. just looking up inside, your voice echoed for so long.&nbsp; So much for the security...pfft. we finnished taking pics and walked back to the car and drove home, never with confrontation.suckers.</P>

"event","<P>Well what an <FONT size=5>Eventfull</FONT> weekend. Been a crap one, it really has. for many reasons really. It went too fast....way to fast. I cant belive i have to go back to work allready. feels like i only just got away for a break..2 days felt like 2 hours.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Its time to let go of that hope, i know its gone now, gutted, &lt;/3, dissapointed...I thought this time things would go ok for me, i thought i had found what i had been looking for, perfection almost. I knew from the start i guess. i thought i would make it through, but the line has been cut and im drifting...sinking. </P>
<P>City as usual it was on sat night, was so nice to see just about everyone out. :0) Jenna, Lauren, Nici, Laura, Bekki, Oldy, Lewis,Loren, Blissy, Scatt, Lee, Kay, Partay Platts...and the one and only Mr JT aka Josh, fucking LEG-END. I wanna say sorry if i forgot someone and i want to say thank you to those who know who they are for talking to me and setting my head straight.</P>
<P>Sunday- today..Did nothing really, lots of thinking to my self. I had such a wicked time at band practice. It was great. Oldy came along too, was cool, think he was digging our cover of Warning, cos he asked us to do it again. Everyone was full of energy even after the night before getting fooked. Was great!! and then,Plattsey....Pulled out this new song....Sexy bastard!!! really is sounding great sounds kinda hell is for heroes/Reuben.. ish Absolutly adore it. cant wait to get all the lyrics sorted so we can start getting some gigs. i cant wait till tuesday till the next practice. that will be awesome as fuck.</P>

"event","Well thats it, monday allready. The weekend flew right by, it sucks how times flys when your having fun. Saturday started off shit, me and oldy were nackered and wishing we hadnt agreed to go out and meet a guy from work, but the night ended up being proper bo. A 6pack of redbull and 2 litres of vodka and coke soon sorted us out and made us hella glad we came out. Started off in Rescue rooms where we saw Laura, Laura, and nici sat on the comfy chairs so we joined them for  a chat. That was probably my favorite part of the weekend, chilled out as fuck music full of people sat talking to everyone for ages and that unspoken feeling of that atmosphere about a place full of people on a night out. Ahhhmazin. After a bit those dudes had to dash to we went to speak easy after meeting up with Scatt and plattsey....blissy didnt make it hahaha bless. speak easy was ok, allthough the pool table was out of action. doh. They closed early i think, or did i loose track of time. hmm. City was all good. Nothing special, music was good for a bit. Was awesome to see Nat hate not seeing her as much anymore. awesome. here comes another jam packed fun week of work!!! YES I CANT WAIT....honest *rolls eyes*."

Went lewis's house first for some pre night out drinks. was battered b4 i left the house to be honest, seeing as we made a mad punch with free alco-pops and vodka. After that we headed into notts for the meal at Scruffy's. the food was ace. Plattsey made me laugh, he was the only one not eating cos he was on ""a liquid diet"" meaning he went to the bar and kained more shots and beer than most of us managed over the course of the night. What a guy!!!</P>
<P>After the meal we hit up Rock Shitty, got so many dodgy looks as we wandered around pimp'd/g star'd up. Was a laugh tho.</P>

Im hitting Notts on saturday, going down in the day to go shopping, then gonna get batterd thanks to happy hour at rescue rooms, then i dont think im going to city, but dunno, who knows either way ill be out and about somewhere out of my face.

Getting hair cut hopefully in the next few days and having it coloured aswell soon, black and blonde highlights im thinking. Lee from lostprophets has the hair colour i want.

Working nights has lots of advantages like more money, lay ins. having all day to yourself, working when the world is asleep so ur not missing much.
but ive found disadvantages too, like not being able to go out and hang out etc with my mates, little things like not being able to watch a programme u want to or sit on msn and have a natter when everyone is online. I think ive pretty much put myself in a situation where theres no way ill get a girlfriend now...lol cos im not out enough and i only have 2 nights a week free. wich sucks. ah well. sorry for boring you.

then the D-I-S-C-O kicked in...but the dj sucked balls proper hehehe DJcocksmoker. lol. by this point i was paraletic almost. i had to stop drinking for a bit to ensure my upright standingness while awake. didnt want no man down. i took a few pics which ill try to get up soon, but im sure xxxoldyxxx will beat me to that so there no point.
the bar closed at like 1:45 which was pretty awsome, i started just feeling tired and like shit, and ria was by now flirting with one of my mates which sucks, alot. especially after what went on only an hour b4 i saw her flirting with him...bitch. i know she is gonan post a comment back...probably making me look wrong as usual. botherd.
I had a few EMOtional goodbyes to a few mates...Harris and Holly in particular. even tho harris isnt moving away..silly boy. But Holly is going to leeds, which sucks, ill go visit her tho.
Then i went to my room and went to bed, i had a massive bed it was so comfortable. well better than my piece of broken ass thing they call a bed. had a good night sleep. wasnt too hung over this morn. had a breakfast at the hotel then checked out and went home. lol but we just went out for lunch at weatherspoons. crazy. Tonight> i think im just gonna go for a cruise with Oldy and the Suttons etc around and about. fucking rude boys..innit!!!

sorry that this is a really shit boring post about something that is actually intersting if i could be arsed to write properly. im tired. real bad.

"event","<P>well....here i am...again...its 03:38 at the moment...i have to stop this. I need to change a few things really...<BR>First of all i need to sleep properly because it cant be good on my mind with all this shitty lets not sleep much business.<BR>secondly, i need to cut down on the getting drunk...i have done and im still working on it. last time i drank was michelles party last sat. thats 4 nights in a row without booze...thats good for me, infact no wait i had one can of fosters last night at scatts...lol dammit...see..i fail.but me and oldy have&nbsp; a pact at the moment...neither of us are hitting city for a whole month..we are half way...this saturday will be saturday 2 without city. or thursday for that matter....need to save money rather than blowing it on getting out my face...i sound like an old man... im 18 i shouldnt care...but i do...i looked at my last bank statement and the fact that i spent 220 quid just on getting fucked up royally is really bad. i dont spend any of my money (which i really do have to slave at to get) on stuff i can show for my money..like CDs i want or clothes etc. so im gonna actually do this and buy some stuff...rather than blowing it as i normally do...then after the month is up, when i hit city...it will be awsome cos ill get bladded for low amounts of cash and it will all be good rahter than routine... i know if anyone is reading this they will be bored...im kinda venting stuff at the mo and sorting stuff out in my head.Thats why no one comments. i read other peoples and they got shit loads a comments...its cos i rant too much and no one has any thing to say because there just isnt.<BR>I really want Billy Talents Album...and i want Reubens album...they are awsome live....Oldy asked me today if i had any Thursday albums i could lend him...and i paused for a second and realised that i dont actually have any...that sucks Thursday are like one of my favourite bands...all i have is a few MP3s... i need full colapse and war all the time...lol make me think of dotty skag heads spending every penny they can find on their next fix... i seem to just no buy anything except alcohol. I couldnt even afford to buy one of my best mates a present for her 18th...its gotta be late...i suck so bad at presents...ill get her one...:( i dont speak to Nat much no more...not since the end of 6th form...she seems to either hang with kelly or with her boyfriend...hes cool..which is weird, nat normally goes out with proper nob 'eds who treat her like shit...hah made me think..i blew it a year ago this saturday...fool.ah well.lol made us proper awsome friends cos of it. i love her to bits... thats another thing i need to change..im gonan make the effort to see her more...she lives quite close. </P>
<P>hmmmmm...what else.......im single at the mo' thats all good tho' i dont mind at all, ive been through ALOT of shit cos of the O-+ Gurls...I dont need no shit. At least im not bothered about being single...thats a good thing, it sucks when you are and you dont wanna be. She hardly talks anymore...never txts...replys to emails...she commented on here recently...im obviously out of her mind...shes after other people now im guessing...which could be a good thing, as long as its no one i know...shes more or less out of my life compleatly.</P>
<P>I need a Full time job. Id quite like to work either as an apprentice or what ever with photography..that would be cool working with a company and learning new stuff as i go along...would be useful. Things look like i will prob just end up working at the airport..prob night shifts.be reet. i need to pass my driving test before i can have that job...my test is in 9 days...still not got a new car. i want a metallic silver Quicksilver edition peugeot 306 or newer style 106...im loving the quicksilver stickers and interior on them. Im gonna get this new job save up some dolla and do some travelling..even if i have to go alone...i honestly dont mind.<BR>Im gonna get a nice SLR camera and hit the following if i get enough dolla:<BR>Paris, Berlin, Prauge, Rome, Moscow (maybe also St.Petersburg while im over there)heh mum sed she wud come to russia with me. them cities are my prime targets....heh The <A href=""http://www.oldy.3rror.com"">Shoot-to-kill</A> European tour. that would be amazing. Theres these photos of notts in Mcdonalds that have gave me ideas...really simple but effetive..gonna have a go after some sleep maybe on paint shop on my computer(this is the shit family one that is slow and gay...but yet deserves broadband???). This really is a long boring post....apollogies.</P>

"event","ok so starting from now i need to stop falling for females who are emotionally fucked!! cause all they end up doing is screwing with my head, and drag me along for the ride which isnt cool. especially as im kind of getting used to it and becoming to expect it.. which isnt a very good way to live, but thats ok my thing for 2008 is to try new things and not to be dragged down by emotionally fucked people.

anyways today i worked hard at fucking wendys, oh well i just have to work hard to find a new job, i did however perve on nicole alot which was fab hahahaha

anyways im tired, i put up the queen bed frame tonight, good stuff!!

Although i only have 2 periods today so i finish at 10.35 i think, then im off to penrith to go to work, even though i dont start till 1.30pm. Im pretty excited to work at the moment as i have a major crush on a girl i work with.. she's straightso i know nothing will ever happen, she knows i like her, but everything is still relitively normal,its just hard when trying not to stare at her much, as she is beautiful and full of life, even though she is at Wendys every single day, while waiting to start uni next year.. 
umm i think its like 5 days till my bday of smtg like dat, yay go the 29th of August!!!!!!!!! 
ahhh ya i won at basketball last night, and i actually played alright got the two shots that i tried i got in.. thats something that doesnt happpen all that often..

i failed 3 out of 5 trial exams, even food tec which i tried so hard for, i got that back today i was soooooooooo upset. im a bit scared of telling mum, i dont want her to be disapointed in me, which i know she will be... 

mmmm i dont think theres much new with me, my life consists of school and work, i never get to see any of my friends that mean the world to me.. 

im trying this new thing where im trying to be confident with myself and be comfortable with who i am.. so some of u may know already, but i like girls.. i guess im bi, as i still like guys.. so there ive said it now, oh ya no one tell my family!!! oh and ally if u read this then plz dont mention this at school as the trouble it caused last term, i spent most of that term paranoid and angry at people who i thought were my friends, ha ya right... the things people come up with and i hadnt even said anything, i can only imagine if i did say smtg... 

ya i think thats all ill say atm

mum went to hospital on sunday, as when she was mowing on the ride on lawn mower at jamies, and its on a hill, and somehow she fell off, the mower fell on her and punched her leg, its on her shin, so they cant stitch it up as there is no skin to spare on da shin, i dunno, theres like this hole in her leg about an inch deep.. eww its gross, i have a picture but its on my phone and i dont know how to get on on the computer... she was ment to come out yesterday but she had to have minor surgey, to clean it out properly, as its open and she was cutting lawn at the time. but all in all she ok! i just miss her atm. 
Today is tuesday, which means after today there is 3 more days of school, oh i sooooo cant wait fo the holidays, more free time to hang out with friends ;-) but at the moment im so exusted, i need alot of sleep, many hours to catch up and get rid of the dark cirles under my eyes... 
oh and im going to melbourne on the 27th for 7 days with my great aunty barb, to go down to see her son, who she only met last year, im excited, i need to get away. 
and im sorry to those of u ive ignored of not paid attention to in the last couple of months, as ive been really really stressed out.. but its all good atm.. oh ya nat if u read this i love u so very much, ur the bestest chicken eva, and we need to reall catch up, u too lou, we need to catch up to and everyone else i havent seen in ages.. much love to u all

You take a while to fall in love with someone. Trust takes time.

You tend to take more than give in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

"event","My Friend 

We all need someone
To talk to in our life,
A friend to whom we run
In times of stress or strife

A friend who's always there
Throughout the years,
A friend we know will care
And take away our fears.

A friend who's always near,
Waiting for our call,
To wipe away our tears,
And lift us when we fall.

A loving friend indeed,
On whom we can depend
To fulfill our every need -
Thank you, precious friend"

Friend: that one special person
who makes life a bit
easier by just being
there and listening to your
problems and difficulties.

Friendship: a special bond
between two people.
A bond that time
cannot break. It is strong
like a chain, with linking
hearts."

"event","Gift Of The Seagull 

A lonely seagull flies the winds
Majestic... soaring...gliding wings
A single screech sounds from the sky
Come fly with me... come here and fly

My spirit floats to be a part
I feel the beating of its heart
My soul, one with this bird of sea
Now knows the meaning to fly free

I feel the winds caress my soul
And soar the streams without a goal
My being trembles of delight
A treasure I received tonight

The seagull's flight of soaring high
The gift of what it means to fly"

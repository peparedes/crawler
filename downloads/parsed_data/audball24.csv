I have enough knowledge about english and grammar to meet my needs, so I'm taking the test to get it out of the way. And I'm gonna start making clothes for part of my home ec. portfolio, the portfolio is my proof that I did the stuff. And I want to make some of my clothes. And I like cooking so I'm going to record things I cook. Derek stayed over on New Year's Eve, so I got to see him. Spending time with him is good, and it's wonderful. I should probably go study some more english now. Keep the coments coming, I like comments, hehe :-)"

After Derek got home we hung out for a bit, then he took me to Pat's Pizza for dinner. Once we were done there he dropped me off at dance class. Let's see, yesterday I had a make-up dance lesson, which was ok. Um, this morning Derek's mom called and asked if I would come over and help her today because she wasn't feeling good at all. I went over to Reny's after mum came and got me, and I talked to the manager about my aplication, he said he was going to look over all the aplications next week because they're going to be hiring a bunch of people for five weeks because of the holiday season and all of that. So hopefully he'll hire me. I've turned in aplications to Burger King, Wendy's, but neither of them have gotten back to me yet. I've filled one out for J and B atlantic and the Grasshopper shop, and I have to go back to the Riverside Cafe and the John Edwards store to get their aplications because when I asked them they didn't have any at the time. So I've been doing alot of that lately. I've thought about asking the florist and Ruth Fosters, it wouldn't be too hard working with baby stuff, hehe. I've been doing so many things lately, I've just started a little Christmas decorating around the house, helping Derek's mom with the kids, job hunting, dance class two nights a week, and now I have to write up a book report for the book that I read a little bit ago. It might not seem like a lot to some people, but I feel pretty busy. Tomorrow I help Nola with the kids again and I have dance class, that will be the third time I've had dance this week, I'm already getting kind of sore from the last two. Anyway, I think I've typed enough for now. Latas y'all."

After we went to the mall we walked over to the movies and saw the Incredibles....which by the way is an awesome movie, y'all should go see it.

When I got there I told my dance teacher I was late because I couldn't find them. And she said that she thought I had left them there after my last lesson....and they were. I think I should start stretching every night for at least a half hour..cuz I need to be flexible if I want to do ballet without hurting. Something else that's cool is this thing we're doing in tap.....we have to do flaps across the room in a ""jogging"" style, and it's supposed to sound a little like a horse troting, and last night I was actually doing it! The last time I was having trouble with it. A flap is a move where you only use the taps that are on your toes..you don't use your heel taps at all. Things with me and Derek are awesomely super.

So I couldn't talk to Cheyral about why I've been missing lessons. Then after that me and mum went to burger king and ate and talked. And I dropped off my application..I was hoping to talk to the manager but it was too busy so I have to wait for a phone call. Then we went to the EHS Pops concert....which was ok. First the treble choir sang....which sucked. They all sounded off key and you could barely hear them. I thought the men's choir sounded better, they were much louder. Then the jazz band played, and after them the whole symphonic band played. The stars and stripes forever song they did was the best, especially the part where this one girl did the piccilo's solo, which was awesome because she nailed it. Ya, other than the sucky chorus it was ok. And my feet always hurt during dance class. Guess I just have to get used to it. Yup......that's about all I have for now. Talk latah.

Anyway, Friday was a really nice day, and I was happy to go home and see my kittys and be with my mom. Saturday we picked Derek up from the skatepark and went and got pizza and saw Sharktale, that movie is so good and funny! hehe. Derek came back to the house and we went skating around Winna Habba and came back and had stuffed shells for dinner. Then we stayed up and watched movies. This morning we came back to Derek's house and hung out there until my mom came to get me. And that was my sweet weekend. I have so much fun spending time with Derek, I love him!

Art project due Tuesday, YIKES! heheheeheheheheh"

"event","Dammm....Cheryal really works us, my feet hurt more and more every time I go back to dance class. And my new ballet shoes are a size too big, just like I thought they would be. So I have to send them back and wait a week or two for another pair. I love dancing. That's all for now, later...

"event","Today is Wednesday, which is practically Thursday, which is practically Friday, which is practically Saturday! And there's only a little bit of Wednesday left! hehe. I hung out with Derek today at the skatepark, and I've skated around on fun boxes and stuff at the skatepark before, but today I seemed wussy, but my body is physically tired today, and it was cold outside, so I was kind of tired and lazy. Then after we skated we were sitting on the benches with Katrina. Derek let me sit on his lap hehehe, it kept my butt nice and warm. And then he was tickling me and wouldn't let me go, so I had to yell and squeel to let out the tickled feelings...**sigh**Derek's soo cute and fun to be with. Let's see, tomorrow is a white day, and there's only a couple of white day classes that I like, which are art, French, algebra, and civics. Hey those are all my classes except for english. I'm not really woo hoo yay about english class. The one of the best parts about school is seeing my sweet Derek! hehehehe. I love him! Any way, my throat is starting to get a little sore again, uh oh, I hope nothing's happening again....I'll just take a throat drop, that should take care of it. I'll talk later.

"event","Well, today's Tuesday, and the week is almost half over, which is practically Friday. Today I went into guidance to get one of those drop-class-slip-thingy-mu-bobbers. The bad thing is, I have to get Mrs. Wright to sign the slip thing, and I think she's going to bite my head off if I go have her sign it. Anyway, other than that I've been having a good week. Except today it looks kind of shitty outside, I hope it doesn't rain at all this week or weekend. It's been so pretty out and warm. I've been kind of on the hypey side, but that's because I'm happy! hehehehehehehehe. Any who ba do be, I'm out, laters.

"event","Today is Sunday, which kind of sucks because that means tomorrow I have to go back to school and to my stupid stupid intro to dance class. It's probably the worst dance class I've ever had, no wait..it is. Hip hop is annoying, and I don't feel comfortable shaking my ass. Now I kind of wish that I had dropped the class when I had the chance. I had noooo idea what I was getting into. And we have to write papers....wow, I'm complaining, and I hate complaining. I just feel like this teacher isn't going to know what she is doing. My dance teacher Cheyral had a student who took the same intro to dance class and said that the ballet portion was shit.....well, she didn't say shit, but I know that's what she meant and wanted to say. I should have listened to Derek, because he was right about this class, lol. On a better note, I hung out with Derek last night at the bowling alley. Every time I see Derek he just keeps getting cuter and cuter! hehe. Love you Derek!! Well, my laundry is screaming my name and needs to be washed. And my room needs a little cleaning too. Like my momma says, ""It ain't gotta be pretty, just gotta get did."" I love my mommy.

Today I felt kind of...ughhh....My nose was running all day, and I got these little pains in my forehead from time to time. It was probably something with my sinuses or something. But I'm being a good girl and taking my penicillin. Yeah, I have to take 4 a day, and they're 500 mg each. I'm getting better each day though, I need to get a lot of sleep this weekend. Some more good news....my period should be over tomorrow! You people have no idea how happy that makes me! hehehe! No more being uncomfortable, with painful cramps that make you feel like your overies are going to explode, and having to change your......well you get the idea. Girls you know what it's like....and for the record it sucks. Some more good news, well it's good for me, I start pointe in January, I just found that out in dance class yesterday. Um lets see..what else....I love Derek, he's the sweetest, and he's a very very good person. Well that's all I have for now, laters.

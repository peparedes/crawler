"event","OK, so it has been AGES since I have updated my livejournal.  I think the last time I updated, I had just landed a job at Colombo Kitchen Attorneys; now I've left that job for another, full-time position at Etheridge, Sykes and Hamlett, LLP.  *WHEW*  Anyhow, graduation is soon approaching; I'll be out in the real world in less than a week.  I don't know if that deserves an *eek* or a *yippy*.  

I've actually finished my Civil Lit II project for the semester; all that I need to do now is print it out and organize it.  That should only take a hour, then I'm FREE, FREE of all homework forever (except for exams, and only until next spring when I start back to school).

Today's title comes from a comment from Braxton, he wanted milk, but got the container that milk comes in a bit confused with the container for bread."

"event","So, I'm really liking my new job.  I'm not doing much paralegal stuff, but I'm getting experience in a law office and learning how stuff works in a law office.  I'm busy, busy, busy now, though--I've got a 300+ page project due in my Civil Litigation class at the beginning of December, so between work and school, my life's pretty much full.  Luckily, Braxton understands this, so he's not upset that I don't have much time to spend with him right now.  Once I get my time management better, I feel like my life will be less stressful.

Today's title is from (again) Dr. Bullock's lecture.  He ran out of fictitous names for his examples, and so ""Toad Frog"" was the one he came up with.

"event","Whew..what a long week.  I spent the Labor Day weekend at White Lake, pretty much bumming out on the pier and drinking and eating waaaay too much (dieting's not allowed at White Lake, according to our ""crew."").  That's where today's quote comes from--some college guys were out on a boat in front of our pier, drinking coolers upon coolers of beer, and doing beer funnels...when they drifted closer, we realized they were drinking Busch Light, yet the boat they were on goes for at least $50,000.

OK, so the diet's not gone so well this week--I'm up about 5 lbs. from the alcohol and various stuff I've had all week, and every day that I try to start back, something happens (party at school, going out to eat, eat with the mother-in-law), so I'm just gonna restart tomorrow.  Mama and I are going to the lake, but we're doing salads and stuff all weekend--much healthier than the cheez doodles and burgers we normally eat down there.

Best news of all--I've got a (almost) full-time job!!!  I'm working at a law office in Greenville, doing various errands, filing, etc.  It's 30 hours/week, but I'm taking less than 12 hours this semester, so I can handle it.  I'm sooo excited about working there--the people are really nice, and its a small office, so you get to know everyone really quickly.  Not to mention there are some people my age there, which makes it nicer for me--I'm not around ""old"" people all day.

"event","So, I haven't updated in a couple weeks.  I've been busy, trying to find a new internship, since the one that I originally had fell through.  I've been on one interview, and they've even checked my references, but I haven't heard back from them.  Oh, well, what will be, will be.

In other news, I'm up to my ears in homework, so I guess it's a good thing that I'm not working right now.  I have 27 different assignments just for Chapter 1 in my Civil Litigation class, each of which takes at least 5 to 10 minutes to do.  Luckily we get Fridays to work on this stuff in class, so hopefully I can finish it soon.  OK, enough about school.  I found out last week that I'm gonna be an aunt for the first time--my (future) sister-in-law is pregnant, and due April 12.  I'm so happy for her, but her husband (my fiance's brother) just went back to Iraq last week for a 7 month tour of duty, so it's going to be tough on her going through this pregnancy by herself.

Today's title comes from Dr. Bullock, from the highly entertaining real property class.  We're discussing title searches and deeds, and whenever someone asks about inheritance of property (i.e. not buying or receiving as a gift), this is the man's stock answer.  He's a nut, I tell you!

"event","So, other than my now-constant sleep deprivation, classes are going great.  Dr. Bullock, my Real Property professor, is a bit eccentric, but in a good way (see my title for a quote from today's class).  Other than spending $300 on books, and having to work 20 hours a week for my internship, I think this semester will be really fun.  Highly stressful (2 150+ page projects, anyone?), but fun.  Anyhow, I better get back to learning about holographic wills, so I can get some sleep before my alarm goes off at 5:30 am.

"event","So, my weekend with Lexie and Angie was quite successful.  I bought waaaay too many clothes, but I did need them, since I've ""ungrown"" most of my clothes recently.  I got a pair of cordurory pants, a pair of black linen capri pants, a coral sweater and some cute black shoes.  Oh, yeah, and I hit Priscilla's, buying a vibrator, stockings, sex toy cleaner, and some edible massage oil.  Of course, after I dropped Lexie off at the train station, I had (ha, ha) to hit Crabtree and Triangle Town Centre.  I did fairly well there--just some BeneTint and eyeshadow from Sephora, and bras from Victoria's Secret.  Well, that's it for this entry; I'm going to go back to enjoying my last day of summer vacation before classes start again.

Today's title is a warning on the back of the box my vibrator came in...it said that if the unexplained calf pain occurred, to consult a physician.  Yeah, when I have unexplained calf pain, I always pull out my big purple vibrator. ;)

"event","OK, here goes my first entry at LiveJournal.  This is my second attempt at blogging, and I really hope that this attempt is more regular than my first attempt.  So, what's going on with me?  I'm sitting here as its pouring down rain, watching the cat sleep on the bed--yup, I'm bored as hell.  After I'm done with my cat-watching, I'll go do laundry...Yippee!! ;)  OK, so my friend Lexie's in town, and I'll get to go see her and Angie, and do some much-needed girlie bonding time, as well as some much needed shopping.

Speaking of shopping, I stepped on the scale today to find I've lost over 50 lbs (50.9, to be exact).  Dieting isn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be, so now I'm kicking myself in the ass for not starting last summer, when I first got engaged.

...... I havent written/ updated in the longest time.... i'v ejust been soooo consumed with different stuff
 da schoo' yea is almost up and iI think I have made a complete 180


Some people i though were friends I truly found out werent .. they were mean and nasty and I hated them for it..... but I realize that it was my fault I let muself get too attached to people quickly not really knowing who they are so next time I know be aware and just really know peeps well before labeling them as ""friends""

Some peeps i know who werent my frinds b4 are no being nice I just don know.. I'ves seen things , ppeps gettin hurt .. and things that just dont make sense (lisa u no wat i'm talkin about)and i think I am doing pretty well handeling it alll


since entering hschool peps just changed just dissing old  friends 4 no reason well ... I'm not like dat  and I dont like it so if anyone who knows me and truly wants a friedn  know that I am loyal and not just a poser like some peeps I know... he he just had to vent there a little bit:)


This year has moved by so fast and I just gottta take it all in ....

i mean i think i 've toughened up  i mean i was always afraid to say things that would offend people  but if somethings on my mind it will surley be said

i'm excited for da new year , new people , new experinces all of it but in tears before in my life i always allowed people to walk all over me like a door mat  and that will never happen again          Before i ethink i was really sheltered didnt want to go over the boundry ......I think wat changed me is that not too many pople hled the sme respect for me    they talked about me behind my back and throughout the summer didn t even try to contact me     Frankly i've come to a decision if im not good enough for you then u are not and will nevr bee good enough for me .... whatever keeps me content in life is what i want and wat ill gett and i wot allow anyone to stand in my way

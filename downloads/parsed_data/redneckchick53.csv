"event","i am almost so happy that i will be leaving a certain someone behind... not because i want to get rid of him but because it hurts less to see him randomly then it does when he is just there right in front of your face and you cant do anything but look and long. i mean sure i would hit that again but damn we would make such a great couple! haha isnt that sad that i think about that kind of shit. i tried not to get all lame and sentimental in his yearbook... i was like ""talk about making memories"" haha we definitly did that! so i want him. bad. now. i need to face that i cant have him. "" Keep quiet nothing cums as easy as you"" hahah fall out boy says it all!! so i need to get a boyfriend... this shit is bananas! fuckin rediculous!"

""Nobody Puts Baby In The Corner""

Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me, 
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be.
Light a match to leave me be.

I'll keep my jealousy close, 
'Cause it's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy, 
Then I'm not the only one lying.

[Chorus: x2]
Keep quiet,
Nothing comes as easy as you.
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret 
And your biggest mistake.
The hand behind this pen relives a failure every day.

And I'll keep my jealousy close, 
'Cause it's all mine.
And if you say this makes you happy, 
Then I'm not the only one lying.

Drink down that Gin and Kerosene,
And come spit on bridges with me, 
Just to keep us warm.
Light a match to leave me be.
Light a match to leave me be.

[Chorus x2]

So wear me like a locket around your throat.
I'll weigh you down. 
I'll watch you choke.
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.
[x3]

[Chorus: x3]
[comes back in during chorus 2nd time:]
(So wear me like a locket around your throat.
I'll weigh you down. 
I'll watch you choke.
You look so good in blue.
You look so good in blue.)"

"event","She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
And weighed down with words too overdramatic
Tonight it's ""it cant get much worse"" 
Vs. ""no one should ever feel like..""
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
I need them just to get by
Dance, Dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, Dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up its last call
Last resort
But only the first mistake and I...
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
I need them just to get by
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love
Dance, Dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, Dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me
Dance, Dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, Dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

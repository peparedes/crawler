"event","So Earthday Birthday was freaking awesome!  You all should have been there.  I got in the Mosh pit and started an all girl fight.  It was too cool.  Serg Tankian was the best, and then Filter and Shinedown.  I really liked Ashes Divide, but it was kind of a different genre.  The last two bands to play were 3 Doors Down and Kid Rock, and I'm not a big fan of 3 Doors Down anymore, and Kid Rock was a little slow.  I wanted another pit, but after Shinedown there were no more.  It was a ton of fun, and I got the bruises to prove it.  I had brought tickets for Amanda, Jr, and I, but Amanda decided not to go at the last minute, so I took Kevin.  We got there late and they had moved the concert from where it was 4 years ago, but we had so much fun once we were there.  Jr went crowd serfing, he said he'll have to slim down before next year so people won't give him a hard time about it.  

I love EDBD!

Things are going okay other wise.  I'm a crazy aggressive bitch, but once I calm down I'm fine and perfectly logical.  I have a date with a finiancial planner on Thursday to get my bills together.  His kid's in Lillie's class and Lillie's teacher set me up with him.  I'm so glad because he sounds like a wiz and I need all the help I can get right now.  

I'm so getting into punk music.  I'm digging Misfits, Rancid, and Social Distortion.  I'm going to take Jr to the Rancid concert in June for his birthday.  I am the coolest sister ever, in fact the coolest person ever, and don't non of ya'll forget it.  I've got to tone up a lot before then, because I was getting my butt kicked in the mosh pit at EDBD, and I heard these punk chicks are a little rough, so I've got to get myself prepared.  I decided when I was in the mosh pit that I had to stop smoking, because I couldn't breathe.  Part of it was because of all the dirt, and part of it was that I was pushed on my ass like 10 times, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger right?

Well, keep praying for me, because like I said, I need all the help I can get.

I'll tell you about my house falling apart next time."

"event","EDBD is May 10!  Headlining is Kid Rock.  Also on the line up is 3 Doors Down, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Shinedown, Therory of a Deadman, Filter, Ashes Divide (formed by a guy from A Perfect Circle), and Five Finger Death Punch.  I'm so freaking going.  I can get tickets this week for $35 plus ticketmaster costs, but that's this week only, after that it's $45 plus costs.  So if anyone wants to go, let me know asap.  I think I'm going to buy mine tomorrow, I think Amanda and Jr are going with me.

Don't be chicken, it's a lot of fun, just ask Erika!  I love ya Erika!"

"event","I need help you guys, I've been hating my job lately, and normally once my  enthusiasm goes, it doesn't come back.  I want a job I'd like doing, or at least have some kind of interest in.  I do not care about electronics, or the specs on them, or looking over other people's work.  However, I do not know what I would like to do.  I really wish the government paid more in welfare, or I'd be all over that.  I need the stability of my job, the insurance, the paycheck, and the consistent overtime.  However, I don't care about it anymore, and it depresses me to go to work.   I know I need to go back to school, and I know I probably won't get a good job until I do, but it's gonna take me forever to get a batchelor's degree.  At least 4 years, and I can't stay here that long.  My plan is to switch to first shift once Lillie starts school, and that's 2 years away, but that's not long, (besides I'd like to get her into an early pre-school, and although that's just a couple of hours a day, I only have a couple of hours with her).  I don't want to go to first shift here.  So I need your help.  I'm looking for a job that I would give me benefits, but it doesn't have to be a career for me, cuz I'd like to finish my batchelor's but I'll need more time for that.  So, what options do I have?  There's Real Estate, and I'd have to take some classes for that, but it's only like one semester, but that's not solid (it's based on commission right?) and is there insurance?  Then there's some other quick degrees you can get.  I was going for x-ray technician (so I still have some of those pre-reqs under my belt), but I don't think I want all that radiation. Do I want to work in the Health field, IDK, but I'm thinking no.  What about like pharmacy tech or something, I don't think I'd like that, but it would work for a little bit.  I want something that I work with people and perhaps outdoors a little bit, and but there's some desk work.  What about a cop, I wouldn't make a good cop, I'd be PMSing and give everyone tickets, but that would be fun, until I had to do something dangerous.  What the hell is there to do.  I want something with a little excitement, but not too much risk.  Any suggestions?  i don't think I could work with kids all day, although that would be fun, and I'm sure the benefits would suck, but I'd probably get free daycare.  I was thinking social worker, but where do they work?  I hate WIC and the health department, so I couldn't imagine going into some of those people's homes.  Is there anything out there for me? 

So what do I like, clothes and music, cars(but I don't know as much about them as I'd like to).  I like helping people.  I like doing things with my hands, more fast paced would be good, and I need periodical change.  So what does that get me, I could work at Burger King again, at least It was fast paced, and I was making something.  I have gotten no where, but maybe one of you knows the perfect job for me, and please hurry, I'm dieing here.

Anyway, enough babble about that.  Last week was a lot of fun.  We took the kids to the zoo, on Tylor's birthday, and we had fun, but we didn't get to see the giraffes, cuz it started to rain.  Also, they are having summer saturday nights at the zoo, and after 5pm it's free admission, we're going this upcoming Saturday.  They have a band, so it should be fun, you all should go with us.  Anyway, back to Tylor's party, he had a great party.  Not everyone was able to get there, but we really appreciated those who came and missed those who didn't.  Tylor loved his cake, he had his face shoved in it, it was the most adorable thing I've ever seen.  And thanks to all the great clothes everyone got him, he's looking pimp.  Thank you all so much for the gifts.  I'm already planning Lillie's party, it's gonna be all out Sponge Bob, it'll be great, I hope.  I need to get to know more little kids, you all are going to have to start popping them out, my kids need more playmates.  

Okay, the job search has just went up to a code Red.  Apparently while I was out, more drama happened, and they told one guy he can't work overtime anymore, because he was slacking, and he doesn't slack, so I'm super paranoid, and it makes me want out more.  Please help."

"event","I'm so bored today.  My supervisor and my team lead are out, and of course I can't find much on the internet to entertain me.  It's freezing in here too (just to complain a little).

So not much has been going on, I did my first presentation at work yesterday, which wasn't too bad, but I still got nervous.  I hate it, especially since I know all these people, so I shouldn't be nervous, but I did.  Aside from that I think it went pretty well, I liked my powerpoint presentation, it was kind of fun to play with that.  I'm going to do one presentation a month, which I think will get annoying.  

I dropped off most of the invitations for Tylor's birthday.  I think I just need to send out Mickie's and Rita's and I'm done with that part.  I'm going to pick out his cake this weekend, I'm not sure if i'm going to go with a baby cake or Shrek.  I really like Shrek, and there's a lot of Shrek stuff to decorate with.  IDK.  I think we are going to go to the Zoo on his birthday, which hopefully will be fun although it is so hot out lately.  I have no idea what kind of gift to get him, I was thinking about a couple of little gifts, although they both have a ton of toys, or maybe a big useful gift, like a toy chest, that he won't really like, but I will.  I'll have to check out Toys R Us or something.

Well, I guess that's enough of me spreading my boredom, but it helped kill a couple minutes."

"event","So I won our weight loss competition at work.  I was ahead of my team lead by 7 pounds (I lost 6 last week and 1 this week).  I have in total lost 42 pounds and 2 pants sizes.  I'm happy about losing so much, I didn't think I had it in me.  I know the competition helped, I wanted to win bad.  So I haven't got the money yet, but I think I won like $150 or so.  I have so many plans for this money since it is the only spending money I have right now, but I know it's not going to go as far as I want it to.  I have to buy Lillie a new bed frame (she broke hers jumping on it), she needs a new pair of sneekers, I want to buy at least one new outfit, and I would like to go out to a good restaurant.  I'll just need to be careful what I buy, lately money's just been jumping out of my hand, and it's starting to hurt.

Aside from that, the kids are good, I want to take them to get pictures done, but they both need haircuts, and I don't know how to dress a group for a picture.  Should we all wear the same color? (we don't have matching outfits, believe it or not).  Such a dilemma I know.

Not too much else has been going on, just working and going to the gym and paying the bills. 
 
I'll talk to you all later, have a great 4th of July if I don't talk to you before then."

"event","So I had a lot of fun on my birthday.  On Thursday I took off work and found a super cute outfit to wear to Redheads, but it took me all day.  Then on Friday Joe and I went to Bennigin's.  I was disappointed, because I didn't realize they were more of a lunch place, they didn't have the best selection for dinner stuff, and there was no bread or salad or anything.  I hadn't been there in a long time, so I wanted to go again.  The best part was dessert (isn't it always)  Joe and I got the Death by Chocolate.  It was so good.  It was Rocky Road ice cream on an Oreo cookie crust, with a chocolate shell coating, and chocolate fudge to poor over it.  Oh my god, I thought I was going to die it was so good.  Then Ashley came over and finally saw the house.  Then Shayna, Adam, Joe and I went to Redheads.  It was fun, and the drinks were great.  I really like the Jolly Rancher Martini, but the Peanut Butter and Jelly Martini was good, I just had a problem drinking peanut butter and jelly.  We danced a little and saw the casino boat come in, it was more crowded than last time, and definitely hotter, but we had fun, and the late night binge of McDonalds really made it a great night.
So Saturday we went to Old Town.  It was so much fun.  They added more rides in the back of Old Town, behind the lake where the big swing is.  They had the best Go Cart Track there, it circles up 3 loops, then it has a large slope that you go down, and it looks like you're going to come off the track when you're going down the slope.  It was definitly fun.  We went to Burger King to eat and then we walked around.  I love it there.  On Sunday we went to the beach with my mom, it was a lot of fun, I kind of have a little tan going on, but not on my legs.  Why are legs so hard to tan?  

The only bad thing that happened this weekend was when we were gone at Old Town we had left the dog chained up outside, and he got off his collar and attacked and killed the ferrets.  I felt so bad for Joe, he really liked the ferrets, and even though we were planning to get rid of them, we did not want anything like that to happen to them.  We thought about getting rid of the dog, but we decided to give him another chance.  He's really good around the kids, and I don't think he would ever hurt them.  I think it was just because the ferrets were so rodent like that he attacked them.  

Well, thank you all for all of the birthday wishes.  I had a great time, but hopefully more of us can get together next time."

"event","I haven't been doing too much lately, sadly.  I did get my hair cut by Shannon and it looks great!  I colored it myself, and it's not the color I thought I was going to have, but I like it.  Shannon gave me a ton of her clothes, I love them, I'm wearing one of her outfits today, and it's defintly cute.  

Oh, we got a dog.  He's a begal, he's nice, I didn't want him at first, but he's a really good dog, so I'm okay with him, aside from the fact that he wants to sleep in my bed, I'm not having that.  The kids love him and he's really good with them.  

So with my weightloss challenge at work I've lost 15 pounds so far, but my team lead has lost 12, so she's trying to catch up.  We all know how much I hate her, so my insanity is really helping me to stay on track.  I'm not going to let her win, I don't care what I have to do.  I've been doing my biggest loser workout video twice a day, and I'm eating like those healthy choice meals (they aren't so bad).  I do awful on the weekends, but I've been able to contiuously lose 2-3 pounds every week, so pray that I keep that up.  My team lead and my supervisor are doing the atkins diet, and it'sfunny, cuz my lead lost 8 pounds on week, which pissed me off, but then she gained 3 the next week.  So I really don't put much faith into that diet, I think it's too hard to stick with.  I just need to keep exercising and I'll do fine I hope, It'll be cool if I can loose like 20 pounds, which isn't that much more.

The kids are doing good.  We got a kiddy pool and Lillie loves it.  Tylor's almost walking, I think he's just scared, but he can walk around furniture as long as he's holding onto something, but he's afraid to let go.  Soon he'll be running after Lillie.

Okay, I need to get to work, I will talk to you all soon.  Hopefully I will see you all this weekend for Ashley's 24th birthday (she's so old), get on her and see what we are going to do."

"event","All we've done at work this week was eat.  And today I really don't have much work, so i read like a months worth of your postings.  I have too much to do before Christmas.  I wanted to plan a little X-mas dinner for my mom, but so far my plans are very vague, I haven't had time to think.  Christmas cards are a joke this year.  I feel bad, cuz people give them to me, but i still can't convience myself to write them.

I am eating way too much lately, I think cuz i'm telling myself i'm going to diet after the new year, so i have to get my fill now.  I have to go to the doctor on Friday, and that scale is the scariest thing, because you are not the only one seeing that horrible number.  Right now i'm eating on chocolate covered coffee beans my supervisor gave us.  They are so good.  Rockwell gave us two movie gift certivicates.  I thought that was cool.  Now i have 4, shame i don't get out much.  I have to go to walmart sometime either friday or saturday, that's going to be a mess. That little dinner i was talking about i still have to do all the shopping still.  I'm pretty much done with my gift buying, considering i did not get much for anyone but the kids.  I was gonna give out cookies to my family members, that's from the heart, so it's all good.  

I applied for two team lead jobs, i don't think i'll get them, but it would be nice to get out of here. You know how well i get along with my lead, sometimes i wish she'd just keel over.  

Tylor's doing great, and Lillie's a mess, but she's adorable.  Her hair is getting long.  It's so pretty. 

Mickie, your mom sent us a package this morning.  It had gifts for the kids.  It had two really cute stuffed animals, guess what kind of animal .... horses, they are really cute, and Lillie and Tylor both like them.  The rest of the gifts were wrapped, so I'll have to inform you later on those.  She's too good to my kids.  The stuff was in a big box with those foam peanuts, so we put Lillie in the box and took pictures, she played in there for a while.  We are easily amused.

This is going to be the busiest weekend, but i think we have Saturday free, that should be a great day to go shopping J/J.  

Well, i hope you all have a great Christmas, and hopefully i will get a chance to hang out with some of you while I have my two weeks off.  That's right, no work until January 8th.  Thank god!"

  We had a great time on Saturday! Tanya and Ashley, you should have went.  It was so nice to get out, Joe and I really don't get too many oppertunites go out like that.  Thank god for Jr., he was such a good babysister, and he works for free!
  I got pictures of the kids today.  We got them done at walmart.  I really like some of them, but I was disapointed cuz Lillie was being kind of a handful, and she took her shoes off and she wouldn't put them back on, and the woman said her feet wouldn't be in the picture.  She lied! Ashley, your mom would have a fit.  And it's such a shame cuz it's the cutiest aside from that.  Then there was this one pic with Lillie and she had her eyes closed, and it was not a very flattering face she was making, so i asked if we could exchange it for another sheet, the woman said no problem.  But after like 15 minutes of her looking for the manual, calling another employee, and fiddling with the computer, she askes us to come back tomorrow.  I'm not too happy about that, cuz we have a lot to do tomorrow.  Walmart's cheap, but the employees are not the brightest.  
  Tylor's such a good baby.  He doesn't cry too much, but he does like to be held a lot, but that's kinda nice.  He's smiles and coos, it's the most adorable thing.  I gotta video tape it.  
  Oh, we cut off our home internet =:(  I'm sad about it, but i never went on there anyway, and we were paying like 30 or more a month for it, and it's getting to be cruch time for house hunting.  We are so bad with our money, but we are trying.  Maturnity leave really killed our bank account.  It's so sad now.  Thank God for Tax season.

"event","So we have good news, we got aproved for a loan, and we are working on buying Denise's house, Rita's friend.  It's right by my dad, which i'm okay with, but i'd rather be a couple more streets away.  It's funny cuz everytime i Denise invited me to her house she would kick me out, that's why i've only been there twice.  Once was halloween, and she was hitting on my friend Josh, until someone pointed out that he was only 16, and then she made a big deal about everyone under 21 had to leave, funny enough, she personaly invited Josh and I and we were the only two under 21.  Then another time she wanted to have a girls night out and i came over with Joe, Jr, Lillie, and Rita's husband Micheal, so she really just kicked the boys out that time, but since i drove them i had to go too.  So, i just wanted to point out the irony of that.
    So, if we get this house, it's like 1000 a month and then we have to pay home owners insurance and water, and cable.  That's a hell of a lot more, and i'm not sure if we are going to be able to do it.  We really want to, and we might have to go dirt poor again to do it, no joke.  So, the first thing to go is, my lovely internet, and no cable, and no more cigs for joe, and the food budget will be like 30, so maybe i will get skinny, that's a plus.  I don't know what to do, but we want a house, and after a year we can refinance and the payments will be lower, and i will have gotten another raise.  So only one year of hardship, then we will be only poor, not dirt poor.  Another thing, i don't know what cost it takes to close on a house, so we are trying to save as much now as possible, i wish joe's dad would have told us about the divorce when we still had tax money. Oh well, wish us luck that everything will work out for the best."

She told my dad last night she didn't feel good and she made her bed up to look like she was in it, but she wasn't! She went to her friend house, and my dad didn't know until like 1pm today, he thought she was sleeping late cuz she didn't feel good.  We tracked down a few of her friends and they led us to this boy's house who said she hadn't been there, which was a lie.  For some reason his story changed after my dad called the cops.  He then said amanda left 30 minutes before my dad got there.  So my dad had to met the cops at his house to file a missing child report, and amanda went back to that boy's house and called my dad. She got home, and from what i heard, my dad riped her a new asshole and then some.  She is so retarded!  I hope she finds reality soon, cuz her crap is getting old.

I hope you all had a good easter, my mom came over and we ate with her and went swimming, but the water was cold.  Then we had to go to my dad's and eat with him.  They had much more and better food, and elizabeth brought cream puffs and mini eclairs, damn her.  It was good, but i had to be rolled out of there.  
Hostel comes out tomorrow, i'm excited, i wanted to go see it in the theater, but when we finally decided to go it wasn't there anymore. We are going to ride bikes up to blockbuster to get it, so if anyone sees me laying in the road, it's okay i only had a heat stroke.  I'm just joking, i got my gatorade, and i make joe stop ever ten feet if i don't feel good.  i can't believe it's so hot already, i'm never going outside this summer, if you need me i'll be in a bathtub filled with ice.

"event","We just got back from a long bike ride and i need a shower, good thing you guys can't smell me.  I'm trying not to eat sweets, and the day after i vowed this it was donut day at work, but i did good, i got one and brough it home for Joe.  We took Lillie to see the easter bunny at walmart yesterday, and it was so cute, she love him.  She was laughing the whole time and when we walked a way she waved for as long as she could see him.  They gave us free pictures and it's so adorable, i can't wait til she hunts for eggs.  Then i took Amanda shopping for her birthday, but i also brought my mom and lillie with us, and it was exausting.  Lillie needed a nap and i had to carry her around Ross, that girl is heavy. My mom did good, but she kept telling me to watch lillie and go get lillie food and she was very impatient when she was done with a store she was ready to go.  It could have been so much worse, but i got a little overwhelmed a time or two. Oh i got the baby a onesy from hot topic that says don't kick the baby and has Ike from south park on it.  I think it's cute, it was on sale for 9, normally 18, there ain't no way i'd pay 18 for an outfit he might only wear a few times.  My bellies getting huge, i'm gonna look like a whale by July.  I'm saving for the electric bill now, cuz i know i'm not going to deal with this heat.  Maybe i'll move to Alaska for a month or two. That storm was scary last night, it sounded like lightning hit right outside my window, i kept thinking it was going to strike through the window and i will have Powder for a baby.  Well, gotta go, oh we get the love seat on tuesday, i love our couches."

"event","It's so nice, it's not as comfy as the one in the store, but i think we just need to break it in, not a problem for my big butt.  I have been so bitchy lately, it sucks, i'm just annoyed over everything. It's okay, i have joe to take it out of.  we went to the beach today,it was nice, but i forgot it was spring break week and all the kids were out.  It's normally really nice to go on fridays cuz everyone's at school or work.  Amanda's birthday's coming up soon and i don't know what to get her, condoms?  Well, my life is pretty boring.  i'll talk to you all later"

"event","I am hungry, i'm waiting for the pizza to cool down, and Joe's on the phone with my mom.  I'm glad he's handling this well, but i get impatient with her, she's not bad, but she wants to buy Joe and me a house.  That will not happen cuz i don't see how she has money, and for a better reason, i will not put myself in a posible position to move her in.  Love her, but i could never live with her.  I'm horrible, Joe's in the background encouaging my mom, and i'm being a bitch.  

On a different note, we've been running around all day getting stuff done, and looking for a rug doctor so we can clean the carpets before the couches get here.  We went ahead and threw the old ones out, and it felt good. I can't wait for the new ones, but we still have to wait until Thurs, we just didn't want to store our old ones while the carpet dries. We still have to go to my dad's house, he sold my car and i've gotta pick up the money, i have to give some of it to him, since he sold it for me and they gave me the car for free, but that still leaves a good share for me.  I want to keep it in checking so i don't have to worry about little things, but we like to spend.  And we waste so much on food, it's stupid but it tastes so good, and i can't cook, so it's the logical choice.  Well, pizza's done, gotta go."

"event","I'm off today, thank god, that place sucks, but i like the paychecks.  We might sell my subaru today, That will be great, i didn't think it would sell so quickly since it looks like crap and i haven't even cleaned or vacuumed it yet.  I need to go couch shopping, i hate my couches, then maybe i'll have a couch party.  Speaking of parties, Tanya, you guys so need to have a house warming party.  I'm sure you have plenty of stuff, but we can always bring alcohol, and more importantly we can finally see the place.  
  We went to the beach today, no place better to make a girl feel fat and self conscious, oh well.  I'm trying to tan my legs, but it is not working.  We had fun except they were working on moving dirt or something, the had huge trucks riding up and down the beach, so it was not too relaxing since it made me very nervous around lillie.  
  We might go to the zoo tonight, but i doubt it cuz i have to wait on those people to call about the car."

"event","I ruined my old computer so i bought a new used one for 200, and he hooked me up with anti spyware, norton and a firewall, so hopefully no more viruses.  Not much going on here other than that.  I hate the people i work with and i can't fit into my jeans anymore, so i have to go shopping.  Oh, more importantly, THE GIRL SCOUTS ARE OUT!!!!  I got some cookies, but i may have to buy more, because i don't think 3 boxes are going to last long.  Maybe that's why i can't fit into my jeans.  No i don't think i've gained too much since i got pregnate, but i do think my jeans never fit right."

"event","2 days on the net was all it took,,, i blame joe for his adult adventures online.  I got threats of a virus so i bought spy sheriff for 30 bucks to delete the threats, but that did not work, so i bought an anti virus cd at walmart and it wiped out my computer, i have no start, no programs, no net.  i'm pissed, so now i have to get it fixed somewhere for god knows how much and how long.  To think i was finally gettingup to date, i tricked you guys didn't i.  Oh i'm at rita's by the way.  So i'll talk to you when i get all set up again."

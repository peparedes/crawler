Im glad that he is really sweet but doesnt say things to make me fall for him. But so yeah its good life is ok. Today was realy fucking gay though i almost lost my temper out on my friends it was pretty gay they kind of got a little freaked out but they know i have alot of stress on my hands so they werent mad or anything and at least i only threw the phone at the wall instead of at them. My best friend can be so bitchy and complainy sometimes it kind of makes me mad but i get over it cause eventually we always have fun right lauren. Yeah lauren is like my best friend she knows exactly how i am and doesnt care actually she kind of made me the way i am sometimes but i dont mind it.Wow there are so many things i want to say to some people right now but im just keeping it all to myself. This is gay im writing in here for no fucking reason i dont even so what the fucking point is of me having a fucking journal oh well i guess its so at least i can fucking say what i want to say on here its way fucking better then writing in some stupid notebook ""journal"" but yeah oh well im over it no one reads this anyways, but its all good i dont care im like just talking to myself nayways everything i say to anyone no one listens its pretty fucking stupid, fucking a ive used fucking way to many times but i guess its really the only word i like to use when im pissed so yeah but anyways well i hate lots of people right now and you know what from now on i think im going to start showing how i feel more often im not going to let people walk all over me. wel im going to bed now cause i havent gotten much sleep in a while its stupid and pointless but whatever.

"event","If that was to me im not taking it as a hate letter, well im sorry i came into your life and everything. Now i know i wasnt important to you at all. But whatever i guess sorry for me thinking i was. Why couldnt i have just listened to everyone else. I guess thats me i dont like to listen to other peoples advice. im glad you got what you wanted. Well sorry i do still have feelings for you and stuff so thats why i just said i just like you as a friend cause its easier for me i just dont go out and say i dont want you or whatever. Well i hope you have a goodlife and find some girl that doesnt think shes really that important to you or someone that cares about you or wahtever. Sorry i came into your life and had to be the girl you hurt this week, but im getting over dont get mad about anything i say its just how i feel. Friends right?"

Well i dont know if me and eric are going to go out or not cuase im still getting over dan and stuff and that would be kinda hard and awkward but its ok at least i know he likes me and we can see each other alot and hang out and its really fun hanging out with him and the best part is my dad lets me hang out with him whenever! I just wish i was 16 though! So i could drive around and stuff. But yeah well i dunno i cant sleep and well its been a while since ive been able to stay up this late and not be tired.

If I were to see you would you even talk to me or just say hi and then walk away, I dont want things to be different but they are probly gonna end up that way, it felt so weird today when I left and you didnt even kiss me goodbye!:( I dunno what to do so just will you help me out here and tell me exactly how you feel about me, and especially how you feel about my age now."

Im extremely bored cause im just sitting at school doing nothing and I cant see you talk to you or write you so this is the closest I can get to any of thoughs. Its probly not gonna be that interesting either cause its not like I have anything exciting to say! I wish I could say as sweet as stuff as you do to me! You make me so happy every morning and night whenever I think of you It makes me not so stressed out and it makes me forget about everything else in the world. I wonder if hes going to fall in love with me? or if he already has? I wonder if he has ever fallen in love before? I wonder if I would ever fall in love with him!? Hopefully this is the relationship we have been looking for! Well I dont really know what else to say theres just no words that can help me express the way I feel for you!"

"event","I miss him already even though we have been apart for about 24 hours if that. But he says that sweetest things to me and he always likes to hold me close which I love the most. Well if you read this please dont think im like gettting obsessed with you or anything and get freaked cause im not so you dont have to sorry about that. Anyways he has the cutest smile which I can always picture inside of my head. The thing I love the most about him is he has the greatest voice ever and he always sings for me! Im really lucky to have him now I just wish my best friend can find as great as a guy for herself. Well eventually she will if she just looks in the right directions.You know how in your journal you want to leave after you graduate and everything please dont do that if were still together! Do you really think your going to fall in love with me? I have never fallen in love with a guy before in my life well in 7th grade I liked this guy alot but you know I use to think I was in love with him but I wasnt really cause I didnt even know what love was. When hed say I love you I would say it back just because. But now I know the actual meaning i think maybe I can fall in love for real.Well im gonna be going cause I dont have much to say its kinda wierd sharing my feelings like this but then again its kinda cool cause I know Ill never say them or talk about them. I guess its just easier typing them without knowing someones listening or reading it right now."

"event","I'm so happy I finally found a guy that actually cares about me as much as I care about him. There's only a few bad things but they don't really matter to me just as long as I have him. One is that he does'nt live in the same town as me and the other is hes gonna be graduating this year and if we are still going out by the time he graduates I don't know whats going to happen I dont want him to leave me or anything like that I just hope I dont fall for him hard then something ends up happening. Hes the most sweetest guy I've ever met and my sister actually likes him which is a plus! Oh well I guess I shouldn't be worry about whats in the future just cherish what I have now and plus we have only been going out for a few days and things are going good so far because I dont mind hanging out with him ever and when I leave I start to miss him. Another thing that sucks is I dont want him to end up breaking up with me if we cant always see each other like every weekend cause I know that will probly happen sometimes. Well I dont really have anything else to say im not use to writing in a journal that other people read normally people hide theres. But im over it!"

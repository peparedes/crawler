she would suffer, she would fight, and compromise
shes been wishin' on the stars that shine so bright
for answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

and if she runs away she fears she wont be followed
what could be worse than leaving something behind
and as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow
its loneliness she finds..

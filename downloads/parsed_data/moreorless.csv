I spent some time reading old entries; it feels weird, like I'm reading someone else's words.  It also makes me aware of the little ways in which I've changed (mostly in terms of perspective).  I haven't really been keeping a paper journal--a few pages here and there, nothing consistent--and while I usually write entries with more substance on paper, this has its place.  
Getting back into the habit of writing is kind of tough...getting past the ""back to square one"" and ""where do I begin?"" feeling."

She came over and brought me a fan to tide me over for the night until the dudes come to fix the AC.  A fan from her own home.  Which barely does anything, but it's a nice gesture.  

The exhaust pipe decided that it no longer wanted to be a part of my car.  It disconnected at 4am while I was on 95N.  I refused to pull over in the middle of the night (thinking it was my muffler and fully willing to just abandon the damn thing) and drove it (sparking) all the way home.  Today I got it towed.

I haven't left the house yet today.  I was lucky enough to have that option, and there ain't no way I'm going out there.  Well, at least not until later tonight when I think we're going to cook out in the rain.  
Toxic Holocaust were good last night but sounded kinda wimpy.  Their music didn't have any ASS to it. And they were kinda quiet.  More amps, please.

I started a collage last night, which made me feel good.  I haven't made one in a while.  It feels good to make things.

I share a porch with my neighbor, and yesterday she and I sat out and talked for a long time.  It's nice, to have a neighbor I can do that with.  A few weeks ago I let her use my phone once when hers didn't work, and she bought me a sixpack to say thanks.  Nice lady.  Very baltimore of her."

"event","Someone broke into my apartment buidling last night.  Stole some stuff from the apartment on the first floor.  I heard the sound of glass breaking but when I looked out the window I didn't see anyone.  I thought it was a car or something.  A few minutes later I heard someone running.  Still couldn't see anything.  The window that they smashed in is directly below mine, so the angle was just right that I couldn't see down there.  A little later I was on my balcony/porch (damn straight I have a balcony) smoking a cigarette and I looked down at the street to see 7 or 8 cop cars and broken glass everywhere.  I called down to one of the cops and asked if something had happened.  He told me there was a break in, I told him what I'd heard.  The cops freaked me out more by asking things like ""Are your doors locked?"" and ""Is there any place a burglar could hide in your apartment building?""  (There isn't...there are only 8 apartments in the building, and a very small little hallway...but still.)
They said ""Don't worry ma'am, we've cleared the premises.""  I love when cops get all gallant and try to act like a knight in shining-armour. The fact that I was talking to them from my balcony made me feel like the damsel in distress.  
Then we joked about how stupid the dude was for breaking into my apartment building when the richer neighborhood is not that far away.

On a side note, it was strange to be joking around with police.  But I am not someone who ""hates cops."" I hate some cops, I hate the way the system operates, I hate the idea of police...but I don't hate individual people that I don't know.  People become cops for a variety of reasons.  To some extent, I understand why someone might take the job.  

Anyway.  That's what happened last night.  Crazy shit.

I think I've been happy for a little over a year, but that the chemicals in my brain were tricking me into being sad.  Now I can actually experience the happiness, and appreciate it in a more complete way.

I've been spending money like it's nobody's business.  But I'd say I'm spending it wisely.  Mostly spending it on music-related things.

Lately all I can talk about is music music music.  I hate that.  I hate when other people do it, and I hate it more when I do it.  But I can't stop thinking about my new amplifier, and how much I want to play music, and how awesome music is, and oh man I love music, and blah blah blah.  And that's just who I am, that's my passion, and I accept (and like) that part of me...but I really don't want to over-talk it to other people.  Especially because I feel that people fall back on music when trying to relate to other people, and that it's misleading.  It says nothing about a person.  It's just the fluff to avoid real content. 

You know those people who are really good at asking the questions?  Like they seem really interested in what you have to say, because they listen and ask follow-up questions and all the rest?  Well, I'm really bad at asking questions.  I try to give the best responses that I can, trying to avoid the reduntant ""oh, I'm fine"" response while steering clear of subjects that are too heavy, keeping things light, etc.  But then the subject changes and I do a desperate ""well wait but how are YOU doing"" and they say ""oh, I'm fine."" By then I'm already feeling stupid and self-absorbed and person ""x"" is already moving on to social target #14.  Sigh.  

Back to the music part, though...I'm dying to be able to play music in the city I live in.  Even to just rent a practice space for myself, no band necessary, to rock out whenever I feel like it.  To not have to travel miles and miles in order to do this.

Luck is not on my side today.  I spent the morning in a building with an apparent toilet paper crisis, and now I'm at home in a building with loud construction workers.  Who start work at around 8:30 am every morning, working on the apartment directly below mine.  Everything in my apartment rattles and buzzes because of the chainsaws.  Either that or because Godzilla is stomping around outside.  I don't think I'm going to get to take my nap.  So I'm drinking coffee instead, and feeling that uncomfortable hyperactive exhaustion.  I tried to wake myself up by listening to speed metal, but it made me feel edgy and anxious.  Or maybe that's the coffee.  I don't know.

I had an awesome birthday weekend, and feel very lucky.

I also think that the decrease in the amount of my social interactions makes it hard to be social when I do decide to hang out.  It's like playing a piano recital without practicing or something.  I either say too much or too little, and either way, what comes out of my mouth sounds idiotic when I play it back in my head.

But yeah, the season change does make me very nostalgic as per usual.  
The depression will also get better after this weekend comes and goes. I'm going to germany for four days.  To visit my grandmother.  For four days.  Not only is this a stressful enough idea in itself, but my passport is expired.  So tomorrow I get to run around baltimore searching for a post office that will do the emergency passport service.

This weekend was crazy.  Left friday night, drove 14 hours to arrive in Chicago at 8am, hung out, played a show that night, slept 3 hours, woke up at 6am to go play in pittsburg, got back to philadelphia around 3am.  I got in my car to drive back to baltimore, but by the time I merged onto 95S it was pouring rain, my car's check engine light was on, I couldn't see anything, and I was exhausted.  So I turned around and stayed in philly.  I mean I wanted to stay there anyway, more than anything, I just needed an extra kick in the pants to have the courage to shirk responsibility.  When responsibility is offered up next to the potential to cuddle, the latter will win.

Do you ever notice that when you turn on the radio, the song always seems to have some hidden message that is trying to tell you something?  I turned on the radio when I got on the highway and this is the song:

""Take it eaaasy, take it eaaasy.  Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy.""
So then I'm thinking, 'I don't know, should I go back and stay the night in philly?  Maybe I should...'
The song: ""Don't say maaaaybe...""

It made me laugh.  But I find that the radio often plays songs that are oh-so-appropriate whenever I turn it on.

"event","Q: Are you lost?
A: Yes. Yes I am.

If I wrote down my life, mapped it out on paper, it would look wonderful.  But for some reason I'm completely and utterly lost in all of it.  
I always had a fear of ghosts.  Not because I thought they were threatening, but because it seems like the worst kind of existance.  Between worlds, drifting unheard and unseen, knowing only a painful kind of restlessness without a way to resolve it.  I was afraid of ghosts because I couldn't even imagine how awful it must be for a ghost, caught in limbo, waiting to make the final transition to <i>somewhere</i>.
I feel like a ghost.

I had dinner with my parents last night.  
My mother said to me: ""You know, I remember when you were not more than 10 years old...we were sitting at the dinner table and I asked you how your day at school was.  And you said 'oh, school was fine, but I have trouble sleeping.' And I said 'oh no, dear, why?'  And you said 'I keep having nightmares because...I feel like life is passing me by.'""
Me:  ""Yeah...not much has changed.""

My closest friends make comments sometimes about how no one ever really knows me, about how I have this part of me locked away that no one can touch.  Maybe they're right, and maybe they're right when they say that I'm protective of it...that I keep it mine and only mine.  But I kind of wish it were more accessible.  I wonder if that's where the lonliness exists.  Because I feel far away from even the people who I'm closest to, who ""know me best.""  And when the people who know me best don't feel like they know me, and I don't feel like they know me (and maybe I don't know them either, who knows), I just feel kind of hopelessly alone.  So far away, so incapable of being close.  Like I am magnetically charged the wrong way, and there's some force that repels me from other people.  The distance might be very small, but it's still a distance.
Everyone has a part of themselves that they keep locked away...but I exist in mine SO much that it presents more of a problem when it comes to being around others.

"event","I've been thinking that I need to do more to make myself feel good.  Even on the more shallow levels, like buying some new clothes (for once), and giving a shit about my physical appearance in more ways than just the unhealthy ones.  Exercising more, being healthier.  Smoking less?  Making time to do the things that make me happy.  I think I've been ignoring the superficial needs, but I don't think it's superficial to need them.  
I've been sick so long, feeling like a frumpy old blob, and I think I'm starting to go crazy.  
Or maybe it's because being sick makes me watch television, and those commercials that say ""pamper yourself"" are really starting to get to me.
Either way, I need to, I think.

I've also been thinking about what nationality means in this country.  What ""Americanism"" means.  Because there is no single American culture to defend.  America is made up of many different and diverse cultures, all of which immigrated from other countries.  The only uniformity in American culture is that Anglo-Saxonism seeks to overshadow and dominate the rest.  Between those cultures exists a very distinct separation, loosely tied together under a flag.  And why?  Immigrants did not come to this country (and we're all immigrants) to be assimilated into the American ""melting-pot.""  They came in hopes of new opportunity, with ideals of a better future.  They are instead met with disgust and made to feel like ""aliens.""  And if they do not quickly assimilate, they are scolded for not properly melting into this vacuous pot.  The ruling class determines the ideal, and the ideal has a tenacious allegiance to Anglo-Saxon America.  And in this America, the goal is homogonization--to abandon everything in order to follow the mob.  Everything is in mass, but all that is offered feels like a cheap immitation.  There is no distinctive American culture.  It is distinct in that it is comprised of a diverse range of cultures.  And yet where homogenization fails, division is called to replace it.  Anyone who does not want to abandon their culture upon arrival must be separated, quickly sectioned off.  Because instead of seeing the beauty of diversity, it sees only the threat to Anglo-Saxon values.  Their answer is in mass media, in mass production, mass values, mass culture.  And Americans wander around, detatched fragments of people, aliens to America and yet aliens now even to their former countries.  

Then I've been thinking about punk rock in America.  And how much it's learned from ""Americanization.""  Under the guise of an open-minded alternative, punk meets its newcomers with disgust and judgement.  It requires complete abandonment of one's previous lifestyle, and only accepts the limited one it defines.  It scoffs at anyone who resists melting completely into its world.  It does not allow for partial citizenship.  Personal freedom is supposed to be an inherent part of the punk ideal, and yet individuality is wrong when it does not adhere to punk standards.  There is no distinctive ""punk culture.""  There are many different kinds of punk, and yet they remain fairly separate.  It is so wary of ""posers"" that it alienates its own members, regardless of their authenticity.  ""That's not punk.""  ""That's not American.""  ""Get out.""
And so the individual is left feeling like an alien in every area of the world...not punk enough to be punk, and too punk to be normal.  Constantly judged and excluded.

I realize that this has all been said before.  But I feel like we're all so used to feeling alienated that we don't know what it would feel like to be included.  And I sometimes just feel so tired of being alienated from everything.  Because, really, being an individual is so not okay."

All I want to do is sleep to escape from the anxiety this makes me feel.  
You know how they say ""Well, no one can make your decisions for you!""  Sometimes...just sometimes...I wish that someone could.  That there was a computer program where you could enter the problem and it would generate an answer that said ""The best choice is:....""

I don't feel like I have a home.  And everything in my life feels like it's so separate.  Compartmentalized, sectioned off.  Certain parts aren't allowed to merge with others, they are distinctly separated either by thick borders or big gaps.  The isolation is what defines them.  
It makes me feel so scattered, almost schizophrenic.  Or maybe more like a double agent or something.  Yeah, that's better.  That makes it sound more exotic and less disjointed.  Too bad the latter is more like reality.

My travel companions were not as unsupportive as they used to be, but instead remained indifferent.  They picked up my slack, carrying equipment when I was incapable of doing so and didn't even complain about it, but wouldn't want to go out of their way to help me out.  I like how other people who didn't know me went out of their way to bring me tea and ask how I was doing, while my own friends sat idle, completely self-absorbed.  But I expected nothing more, and maybe even expected less, so I guess I feel pretty neutral about the whole thing.

Bad taste is the only typical grandmother quality that she possesses--otherwise she is just mean and cold.  I could tell amazing stories about her and all the fucked up shit she's done, but she seems to be a little better these days.  Last time I saw her, she told my mother that I was pretty.  If you knew her, you would find that as shocking as I did.  I guess she was so skilled in the insults department that she decided to branch out at age 85 and give compliments a shot.  I've only seen her do it once, and she finds it so foreign and uncomfortable that her face still contorts into a strange sneer.  She talks through her teeth, without moving her jaw.

Even our friendship and love we never fully share with another;  there is something of every passion, in every situation, we conceal.  In hours like these we realize the awful solitude of individual life.  There is a solitude which each and every one of us has always carried with him, more inaccessible than the ice-cold mountains, more profound than the midnight sea; the solitude of self.  Our inner being which we call ourself, no eye nor touch of man or angel has ever pierced..for to it only omniscience is permitted to enter.""
-E.C. Stanton

<lj-cut>
For some reason, I always clung to the desire to be alone.  At times in my life I was extremely social, maybe too social--but ultimately needed time alone as much as I needed oxygen.  I associated being alone with being strong, and with being real.  And I am good alone.  Being alone and being lonely are two very different things...and although I experience lonliness from time to time, I still love the time I have alone.  The problem is trying to be flexible enough that I can be comfortable alone as well as comfortable with others.  If I spend a day alone, I am productive, creative, and secure.  I know exactly what I want to do, where I want to go, etc.  But as soon as I'm with someone else I become useless, unsure of what to do, what to eat, where to go.  It's not that I lose myself in others, but rather that I don't know how to share myself.  I am trained to be alone, to look out for myself, to be strong.  However I am NOT so sure how to be cared for, how to let other people in, how to balance out their desires with my own.  When to compromise, when not to.    
I spent so much time shutting people out that now I don't know exactly how to let them in.  And I WANT to let them in.  Four different people in the last month said something about ""you're a very private person.""  Not a compliment, not an insult, just an observation.  And I wanted to scream ""no I'm not! I'm open!  Ask me anything, I'll tell you whatever you want to know!""  But they're right, I am.  I might have an online journal, but almost never mention anything concrete about my life.
I don't know how to make decisions for more than myself.  For instance, if my best friend says ""jess, what do you want to do today?"" I'll say ""I don't know, what do you want to do?""  And she'll say ""I don't care, you decide.""  And I can't.  I am simply incapable of making a decision when it involves more than just me.  Because I know how to make others happy (if she said what she wanted to do, chances are I'd do it without question), and I know how to make myself happy on my own, but something about the combination makes me lose the ability to function.

I feel like if I am alone, I will at least not be fake.  I have no one to impress, I can't acquire an interest to look good to someone else, I can't brag about some new obscure band I like, I can't show off the latest trend.  I might not know the trends, or care about finding obscure bands, or pick up new interests, or impress anyone...but at least I know who I am.  The more unconnected I am socially, the more confident I am that I am indeed ME.  Turns out, I am a gigantic nerd.  I realized this when I made a myspace profile.  I am LAME!  But at least my lameness is honest.  
The thing is, is that it is totally possible to be a social animal and not be ""fake.""  I am pretty secure in who I am, and don't know why I would think that being social would jeopardize that.  I guess it's just that I'm human, and EVERYBODY does certain things that have something to do with impressing somebody else.  And I guess that instead of accepting that human quality in myself, I decided to reject it at the expense of having a social life...instead of just rejecting it and being confident enough in that rejection (even if it should sometimes be imperfect) to be social.

Wow this is long-winded.
I think that if someone who didn't know me read this journal, they would think that I am a very different person than I am.  Or maybe just that I take myself too seriously.  Hah.  I'm thinking that I write this way here because it is my only outlet for these kinds of thoughts...it's not like the time is right to sit and spew philosophical shit when I'm just hanging out with someone.
But I swear, I can be fun!  Really I can.  

In other news, I wish girls had a different way of interacting.  I get kind of sad when I'm hanging out with people and the women completely ignore me.  There's so much female competition, a sense of one-upping that always plays a part in women's interactions with each other.  And then the constant shit-talking, the wariness, the judging eye.  I'm not saying that I'm never jealous.  I would be telling a big lie if I said that.  But I try to recognize it and monitor it.  I feel like if I just admit ""ok, so maybe I feel a little jealous about how pretty and awesome she is,"" then I can just say ""she is pretty and awesome, and that has nothing to do with me, and maybe I should talk to her since she seems cool.""  We're just so programmed to see it as threatening, instead of good.  It's so engrained in our heads that it escapes all rational thought.  We don't even know what we're competeing FOR, just that we're competing.  We have no one to impress, but just this strange innate sense that we should be impressing somebody.  I'm much better about that now.  I don't play that game anymore.  And I value the women in my life more than anything, even if they are few.
But hey, we're all dudes here.

They're clever--they don't leave fingerprints, they can't be traced, they don't sign their name to their letters.

I know that in my own eyes, I'll die a failure.  And maybe that's okay.  Or if not okay, it's at least ""typical.""

Sometimes it would be nice if life really were like a book--where you can pick and choose the right moments to include, trim the fat of your life, and call it ""a complete work.""  Where your imagination can fill in the gaps and reconstruct everything according to what seems right.  

Fumbling around in that strange space between dream and reality.  Words and action.  
Sink or swim.
I am one of the hopeless romantics, one of the hungry ones.  And I know that I like the feeling of hunger more than I like to eat.  

And here I am, forever young, screaming ""I'll never settle! I'll never be boring!""  And wondering why I'm standing there alone, and why everyone seems to resign themselves to that fate in the end.  And maybe my view really is just a symptom of being young, this notion that being settled means being bored.  But we dreamers, we're always bored.  Wherever we arrive, we keep our shoes on.  We keep moving.  

But no one ever dies feeling fulfilled.  No one is ever ""done"" with their life by the time it's over.  So I guess we all die failures in the end.  There's no room for our futures in this world.  There's no where to go.

And I just feel like the more time that passes means more chance for regret.  And more people there are to miss.  And more moments there are to replay over and over until they're dull and thin, laced with regret.  Or at least frayed by nostalgia.  And every moment that goes by gives nostalgia more ammunition.  That fucking nostalgia.

I'm happy in the moment, and I wish I could say ""that's enough.""  But the future is held out like a carrot on a string, and I can't help but try to swat at it every now and then.  Grabbing at the air and thinking ""goddammit all I want to eat is a fucking carrot,"" even when I'm full from a huge meal.  I think I'd rather spit out the food in my mouth just so that I don't miss the opportunity to eat the stupid carrot.  I don't even like carrots that much.  The grass is always greener, isn't it.

But the space in between is filled in nicely.  I know I have to make some changes in order to be happy, but I think that will happen eventually.  Tonight I looked at a glass filled with water and said it was half-empty...my friend joked that perhaps I need a new outlook.  She's probably right.  I'm working on it.  I wonder if it's an inherent part of my personality to never be satisfied.  High expectations?  I guess I'm grateful for it, if only because it makes me push to get the most out of life.  Rest assured, I hope to milk it for all it's worth.

If I am ever found dead and the police claim that it looks like suicide, please make sure they know to start a murder investigation.  

But I haven't been in those dark mental places for a very long time, and while I do credit myself for about 70% of my improvement (and maybe 10% on being a teenager) I am eternally grateful for all the amazing people who helped me to feel strong over the years.  I'm happy to be in the place I am, and even happier when I look at the people around me.  Sometimes it scares me how much I can love once the walls are down. 

Anyway, the bottom line is that I feel very lucky.  And happy to be alive.  And not sure what 2005 will bring, but ready to take it on.  It really did sneak up on me, though...I had only recently gotten used to being in 2004."

"event","I'm obsessed with being strong and never weak.  The problem is that I seem to perceive things as weaknesses when they are quite possibly strengths.  Also that I seem to be a little too hard on myself.  Everyone's got insecurities and weaknesses...so maybe it's okay that I do too.  I know this isn't really profound, and seems really obvious, but...I think I just needed to write it down.

I was actually really social this weekend.  It felt good.  

But seriously, if I wanted 19 degree weather, I'd be living in Chicago already.  I'm not living there because I wanted to avoid 20 mph winds and below-freezing temperatures.  This is seriously offensive."

"event","gears shifting, locking, grinding.  Envy kissed me on the cheek, and I swallowed her whole.  Coffee made me buzz like a neon light and I think I started to hear things.  Loss whispered in my ear, seductive in a way, ""lose everything to gain everything,"" it said.  But I looked at everything as it is now, and loss seemed eery and terrifying and I started furiously writing my name on everything I owned.  But I can't write my name on the things I don't own, and that's when I started to worry.  When I hear sirens I get so nervous, and I can taste my stomach, and my worst fears start flashing like a slide show on my eyelids.   My nose bled today, only a little.  I blew my nose and there it was all dried and brown.  I wondered if that's what my insides look like, all dried and brown.  I thought about that saying: ""we're all pink on the inside"" and I wonder if all my self-hatred really comes from the fact that I hate the color pink.  What an unfortunate color.  I stuck my hand out the window and the cold stabbed at my joints and the breeze pushed winter in through my window.  I thought about all the heat that little gust stole from me and cursed at the air as if it were alive.  And for a minute I thought that maybe it was, because it was moving, and it was going somewhere, and that's more than I can say for myself sometimes.  And from my window I saw an elderly woman walk down the street, struggling, and I thought about time passing and got scared.  I really want to be something, you know?  Before I die I want to read a biography about my life.  Because someone would have written one, because surely I would have done something worth writing about.  Right?  Except that I'm moving about as slow as that fucking old woman, and I feel like I'm on pause."

"event","My stress levels are rising.  One cup of coffee and it's ""OH MY GOD WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!""
And of course no one can ever answer that question.
I'm feeling a little stressed.

On a side note...
I noticed that when people show me support, I get weirded out.  ""What are their motives for being supportive?  Are they being serious?  What do they really think?  What do they want in return for this display of support?""
That's sad, that to be supported doesn't feel natural.  Always narrowing my eyes and thinking ""where's the catch?"" 
But although the past might have bruised me a little, it's nice to know that my present has a lot of awesome and supportive people in it.

But on the other side of that coin...
why is it that some people think that it's their god-given duty to discuss whether MY decisions are right or wrong...or better yet, to ""inform"" me of my ""mistakes"" without being ""informed"" of the situation (ahem: MY situation in which they are not at all involved) in the first place?  Am I supposed to appreciate the concern?  Because it really doesn't feel like CONCERN--I don't feel like these people actually care too deeply about me or my decisions--but rather some sort of bizarre self-interest.  Boredom, maybe?  I welcome the people who care about me to make comments about my life...but I don't welcome the uninformed judgmental peripheral people.  This seems rational, doesn't it?  If my decisions don't affect you at all, why do you care?  If your concern does not come from love, then why would I be interested?  Just because you like to hear yourself talk does not mean that I do.

Sometimes I do need to use this thing to bitch and whine.  Please forgive me."

"event","I have been especially emotional these past few days.  The little things, the big things...I've been reacting to the world in a very emotional way.  I think that it strikes me as odd these days, although a few years ago I would have thought it was normal.  Over time I think that the rational part of my brain took control over my not-so-rational heart.  I've taken a very calculative approach to my life, and even a logical approach to my feelings and emotions.  If I felt something that didn't seem rational, I would convince myself to feel otherwise.  And I know that emotions are rarely felt because they're rational.  But over time I actually became pretty good at training my heart to coincide with my brain.  
I'm not sure that this was the best thing to do.  Safer, maybe.  But it is a very cold way of looking at the world.  I guess it was a response to being overly emotional in the past.  To ""feel"" meant the possibility of feeling <i>pain</i>.  I used to feel so much that I was constantly overwhelmed.  To make thing rational meant that I was guarded by that logic, that I could defend myself against...well, myself.  No matter what happened, I could deal with it.  When the shit hit the fan, I could numb myself to the initial emotional response and then have the ability to work through it rationally.  Where my emotions failed, reason prevailed.  I could choose when to feel, and when to be numb.  I was protected.  

The only problem is that the numbness took over.  And to be numb is far worse than being sad.  Worse than depression, numbness is hollow.  The kind of emptiness that is tantamount to feeling dead.  At least sadness is a feeling.  At least it makes me feel <i>alive.</i>  The only place I designated for my emotions was music--and I can't live my life in a song.

I think I am willing to take risks now.  Willing to be a little emotionally vulnerable, even though I know that I might get hurt.  Accepting the potential of downs as a means to fully experience the ups.  I want to really experience life, and not just to survive it.

I used to write poetry.  Now I write essays.  It would be nice to do both.



p.s.  Falling in love?  Best thing ever.  I've never been so happy to be so vulnerable.  Highly recommend, A+, would love to continue doing business with."

I am hoping that love is going to get me through this winter.  I need to surround myself with it.  Luckily, I have that option.  That, and a very bright lamp that is supposed to help with seasonal depression.  Fake sunshine.  There's something really unsettling about that.

I know that music is the driving force behind...well, most of what I do.  But right now I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing in regards to playing it.  I have the opportunity to <i>play</i> music all the time, but I still don't feel like I have a place to <i>write</i> it.  No creative output.  I think that words need to be put into action, and soon--a.) because I'm getting really ansy and feel a little unfulfilled and b.) because there's a lot of potential in the projects I've been discussing with other people."

"event","First things first...slaytallica was awesome.  You couldn't hear my vocals very well, so I'm told, but I did manage to remember all the words to angel of death and rock out a lot, and have a fucking awesome time.  People went so nuts that I left the performance bruised and bleeding...which I think is appropriate.  I also had (and still have) a severe bangover.  
So singing slayer and metallica songs was a dream in and of itself...but more than that, it was really fun to get out of my own personality for a minute while I was on stage.  It is much harder when I'm representing myself (in my own band)...my actual personality is the opposite of a ""lead singer.""  It is easier to assume someone else's personae.  I got to really rock out and enjoy it.  
I did watch Cliff 'Em All and some slayer videos to get the stage banter down.  We all thought the banter was important.  I wish we had played ""die by the sword"" so that I could have used the stage banter I saw on the video:

""They say that the pen is mightier than the sword...but I say FUCK the pen, because you can die by the sword.""

The dude danny, who practiced with us maybe 3 times (he got back from germany on monday)...played every solo flawlessly.  One of the most amazing guitar players I've ever seen in my life.

We had so much fun that we might even play again.

I suppose most people would wait until they're super good to buy a guitar like mine, but I think I've played long enough to know that it's not something I'm ever going to stop doing.  And it's the one things that consistently makes me happy, without fail.  Having my own guitar makes playing it even more amazing.  
Oh dear god, I'm never going to leave the house.  
Unless it is to play out of someone else's amplifiers, because that is something I don't have (and can't afford) for a while, and makes the whole experience euphoric.  

So the band that stayed at my apartment on saturday might stay here again tomorrow since one of their shows fell through.  I hope it is a little more tame than it was before, because last time was pretty crazy.  It turned into a full on party.  The neighbors might have put up with me before, but I don't want to push it by doing it again on a weekday.  We shall see.

I know that lately my lifestyle has left me feeling a little lonely, but hanging out with aquaintances only leaves me feeling unfulfilled.  I think that as a whole, I enjoy my small world more than I enjoyed my bigger one.  I might be a little too picky about who I spend time with, but at least I always know that it will be time well spent.  There are, of course, many people who still have a permanent spot in my heart regardless of time or amount of interaction...and with those people I do wish that those interactions were more frequent.

"event","Last night it was around <br>6pm, Lucy was acting anxious so I knew she would be going into heavy labor any time... I also was supposed to pick up mac n duffs owner from the airport when the called that evening.. About 8 I rushed over to get them. When I got home Lucy was in active heavy labor.&nbsp; She jumped on my bed and as she was digging herself under my blankets I saw her sides tighten up in a contraction... I quickly scooped her up, put her in her box and got in there with her... Just stroked her head and encouraged her to push.. Praising her each time she pushed.. Well after a few minutes I see a dark balloon starting to come out... Im not sure if its her water bag or a puppy.. Since I had been gone I didnt know her water must have already broken because I eventually noticed movement inside the bag.&nbsp; After a few minutes the whole bag was hanging out of her, unbroken, literally like a balloon.&nbsp; She wasnt turning to break it and I wasnt sure if I should break it or give more time? I quicly grabbed my phone and called Debbie King, a chihuahua breeder friend of mine.. I told her I thought the pup was all the way out, but Lucy wasnt doing anything with the bag.&nbsp; She said break it, clear the pups airway... So I rip the bag open and was horrified to discover it was breach, and the head was still stuck in the birth canal... STUCK!&nbsp; I start gently pulling.. I felt like I was squeezing the pup way too hard.. When she came out finally she wasnt breathing or moving.. I cleaned all the mucus from her mouth and started trying to revive her... Though I was thinking I had just just killed that pup breaking the sac to early.&nbsp; It took a moment but she finally opened her mouth and took a big gaspibg breath in.... I flashed back to Monets babies born at MSU that night that those idiot vet techs didnt even try to revive and felt a flash of residual anger at that whole thing... She was breating a little shallow, and all the time I was working on her she was getting cold.&nbsp; After I got her breathing I still had to deal with the umbilical cord... I had read about how to tie it off in 2 spots with floss, then cut inbetween the two ties... Sounds easy enough.. NOT!&nbsp; Pup was tiny and slippery and wiggling, still attached to the placenta and it took me a good 5 minutes to get the job done... Poor little girl was cold.&nbsp; </p><p>It was harder because of the temps right now... While its in the negative outside, the house is 60.&nbsp; I was working with ice cold hands... Scurrying to get heat sources going... I grabbed an electric blanket to put the babies on while I worked on them... </p><p>While I was dealing with the first one Monet was hovering around, whining, wanting so bad to come in the box with us... I finally let her... She came charging right in and started licking the baby, cleaning her for lucy... While I was still dealing with the first pups cord... Lucy birthed the second pup.&nbsp; Monet went right to work licking and cleaning it.. Lucy did a little, but monet was the main one.&nbsp; Lucy didnt chew the cord on the second one either, so I tied ans cut that one... It was getting a bit easier... By the 4th&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> one Lucy was licking everyone, mother instincts kicking in.... Monet literally had to SHOW her what to do... Through all that the first on that I had pulled out still hadnt nursed. I was really thinking she wasnt going to make it... Especially when I weighed her the next morning and she had lost a quarter oz... Thankfully later that morning I started seeing her nursing strong... <br>Lucy isnt as attentive to her babies as monet was... She will come off her pups for anything. Monet would never leave her pups in the first couple days.. I would have to lift her out to go potty, and bring her food and water.. </p><p>Lucy is off the pups everytime she hears anyone up in the kitchen making food, any old time she wants she leaves her babies unattended.. Monet always kept her babies spottless.. Lucys are always covered in puppy poop... I am always wiping them with grooming wipes... WTH Lucy? Shes getting better each day, but man.. Thought motherhood was instinctual for dogs... Not so apparently.."

"event","<p>Tragedy.... Utter tragedy.... <br>Last night about midnight Monet started her first stage of labor... By 3am her contractions were coming strong and she started pushing.. <p>&nbsp;</p>3 times during which she came out of her whelping box wanting to go out to potty... I though it was strange, because shes never done that before... <p>&nbsp;</p>By 3:30 am she had been straining and contracting with no puppy showing.. I called my vet, they referred me to MSU emergency services.. I called them and they said that I could bring her in for exam, ultra sound, blood work,&nbsp; etc etc... I asked how much was all that... She quoted approx $700 I said.. can I make payments... After going back and forth she referred me to call this care credit place that gives 6 month loans for medical expenses.. <p>&nbsp;</p>O said, Im having an emergency situation and you want me to call and apply for a credit card?&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>I was pissed and getti.g frantic as monet was straining and crying.... <p>&nbsp;</p>I called, wasted another 15 minutes getting declined for that... <p>&nbsp;</p>Called the vet back...wasted another 20 minutes going back and forth with her...&nbsp; was on the phone utterly panic stricken... I ended up hanging up to rush out to MSU with a still straining monet... Over an hour into her heavy labor already I was utterly wanting to get there NOW ...<p>&nbsp;</p>My sense of urgency was intense!&nbsp;&nbsp; Syd and I grabbed Monet and hopped in the car.. after 4am now... Fricking blizzard going on..&nbsp;&nbsp; The roads were awful.. I could only go 40mph... it took anoth 20 minutes to get there... <br>the<p>&nbsp;</p>When I arrived they took monet back to be examined and woudd not let me come... They were gone for another 40 minutes before coming back to tell me one pups heart rate was down to 80 when it shoud be around 200... That pup was in distress and likely wouldnt make it... <br>They recommended doing an emergency c section immediately to try to the save the rest... saying I would have to pay $2500 up front... I called my mom, had authorization for the payment in about 10 minutes.. <p>&nbsp;</p>By that time they xame back and said she passed the first pup... still born..... I said I wanted to see her before they took her to surgury... <p>&nbsp;</p>As I sat with her, they ultra sounded her and noticed the remaining pups heart rates were down, they were in distress... Then just a few minutes later, she passed another still born pup breach..... And a live one right behind it..The heart rate was very low... Monet got that pup going but it was very very tiny and wouldnt nurse... <p>&nbsp;</p>Then since she was passing pups on her own we decided to give her a few minutes before doing any thing else... Then a half hour passed with her having contractions and no pup..<br>They asked syd and I to step back to the waiting room.. To give her some quiet time... <lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p>Against my better judgment I did... <p>&nbsp;</p>Then I sat out there and waited and waited... I asked them not to leave her alone... They seemwd to think it was best to leave her alone... I said a chihuahua should NEVER be left alone to birth... I agreed to go back to the wsiting room only if they promised someone woyld stay with her... <p>&nbsp;</p>LIKE they are going to listen to me... Like when the breach pup came I had to tell them... GET IT... They were just standing there watching the body out with the head still laying inside the birth canal.. <p>&nbsp;</p>At that point I wasnt feeling comfortable that they knew what the fuck they were doing... <p>&nbsp;</p>I had to instill that sense of urgency... ""get the head out, rip the sac... QUICK..	 They just stood there while the body was out and the head was sitting in the birth canal still in the sac... DUH.... suffocating the puppy who had already been in distress.. <p>&nbsp;</p>I kinda took over after that, because it truly didnt seem to me they knew what the fuck they were doing... The pup wasnt breathing and they made no attemt to resusitate it... Which again.. I was like why are you not trying to revivehim...He was alive a moment ago.... They left all stimulation attempts to monet... <p>&nbsp;</p>So I understand why they asked me to leave... I was taking control of what was happening and what we were doing... giving them orders... Only because... they werent doing what they were supposed to be doing... <br>Then when they asked me to leave her alone... I just was like... speechless... Does it make sense in any wsy shape or form to leave a chihuahua in the middle of a troubled whelping ALONE.... No!!!!<p>&nbsp;</p>To me that was the dumbest possible thing someone could have said to me.... Any one who knows chihuahuas knows you NEVER!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everevereverever leave a chihuahua to whelp alone.... ever!&nbsp;&nbsp; cardinal rule numero uno.... Be there with her and assist if need be.... <p>&nbsp;</p>I said if the next pup comes breach, you have to be here with her to help... She said she would stay with her.. But probably didnt... She then left ys in the waiting room for an hour and 20 minutes before saying the ladt pup had been born alive but monet killed it... WTF?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know she wasnt right there... Monet wouldnt do that... she was probably trying to resusitate it by frantic licking....unsupervised.... <br>I asked them not to leave her.... I was just utterly devastated at the whole night.... <p>&nbsp;</p>1pup is still alive... Though she is very very tiny... only .72 oz.... <p>&nbsp;</p>She wouldnt nurse... I was done with MSU.... I wanted to go to my normal vet to complete what was left... She still needed an x ray to ensure no pups were left... <p>&nbsp;</p>I checked out of MSU at 11:30 am and drove straight to Miller... They xrayed monet confirmed no pups were left... They were also able to get the tiny baby nursing..&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>The tiny pup has a good strong heartbeat, shes nursing strongly now.. but shes just very very very tiny....<p>&nbsp;</p>Im heartbroken over the hell monet, sydney and I went through all night... Im so thankful monets ok... And that at least one pup lived for her to mother after all she went through... <p>&nbsp;</p>MSU.... not impressed.... Do you know how to assist with a difficult chihuahua birth?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm gonna say no... ya dont.... <p>&nbsp;</p>I havent slept, I been crying all night and all morning... I need rest but I cant tear myself away.. Just want to sit beside the box and watch them.... <br>it was awful... just awful... Thank god monet is ok.... Shes being the great attentive mom she alwsys is... <br></p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

"event","<p><br>I realized today that I really am starting to feel better about life in general.. I m thinking healthier thoughts.. I'm just feeling downright good.. Emotionally.&nbsp; I think I may be past the darkness I have been consumed with the past few years.. <p>&nbsp;</p>I love it, feels good.. I feel like if things come up, I can handle it.. Ill deal with it.. <p>&nbsp;</p>Going to school, being closer to my daughter, and family, friends, I chit chat alot with people on facebook... I have	ejected from my life everthing that has been a source of stress or unhappiness and thrown myself into things I love, things that make me happy... My dogs, drawing, school... I just feel full of this creative energy and its a really good feeling.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Depression consumed me... I am glad I didnt just get on an anti depressant and stay in the life that was making me unhappy... The cure for depression in my mind is just what I did, change my life... It was hard, it took a long time, but I did it... Im on a happy path now... Need to keep it going.&nbsp; :)</p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

"event","<p><br>What I love about having a little pack of dogs for pets, rather than a singular dog as a pet is, of course watching all their interactions with each other... How the dynamics change when new dogs come in... I am the pack leader so I enjoy that role too.&nbsp; I took them all outside for a couple laps following me around the house.. My role of pack leader outside is I lead, they follow... And now this is the way things always are so its just natural now, they just follow me... Its really cool I think.. being 'pack leader'.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>So we got several inches of snow last night.. about a chihuahuas chest depth of snow... so they were kind of having to work to jump and plow through the snow running... Sasha my little gazelle was springing through the deep snow like a rabbit... It was pretty comical.. <p>&nbsp;</p>Tucker just ran with the pack following me like he never left... The yard is pretty good sized so 2 laps running around the house was enough to tire them out... lucy and monet my little shortcoats were cold and wanted to go back in... Sash and tucker came back out with me to shovel the sidewalk and driveway..&nbsp; It took about a half hour to shovel everything and it was funny watching them racing and springing through the snow... Sash loves the snow... <p>&nbsp;</p>Its nice to have a bunch of chis because each one is so different personality wise.. There's the sweet ones, the silly ones, the smarter wiser ones the super playful ones, some are this or some are that.. I think having just one you miss out on what the breed fully has to offer as a companion.. I think chihuahuas kept in little packs are happier for it... They form such close bonds with each other, their bonds with their pack mates dont subtract from the relationship with their human either...I kind of feel bad for chis that miss out on that.. :)&nbsp; All the snuggling and wrestling and playing and mutual grooming, licking each others eyes and ears, tge confidence gained from always having a buddy by your side.. etc..<br>Not to say single chis dont have good lives with their owners... Its just enhanced living for them to be able to be a little pack.. :)&nbsp; As long as your the pack leader.. :) </p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

"event","<p><br>Bindi is 2.8 oz today... growing and gaining... Glad for that.. <br>I wish she had a littermate to snuggle with... Sometimes I hear her crying and the second I reach in and put my hand over her, she stops... She doesnt like feeling out in the open by herself... She loves to be cuddled... I take my hand away and she starts crying again... She settles right down when I tuck her against the hot water bottle too... She loves that heat.... Monet is generally with her all the time, but she comes out to beg if Im eating, or to go out to potty, to eat and drink etc... so during those times bindi cries...<p>&nbsp;</p>Im finding it very interesting how monet and the rest of the pack respond to her cries... Honestly they all sound the same to my ears... <p>&nbsp;</p>But they obviously are not... Sometimes a certain cry will bring monet rushing back into her box worried and whining... other cries, monet and the other dogs look in her direction with a curious cock of their heads.. some cries monet ignores completely like they are just meaningless noise... <p>&nbsp;</p>Some cries make the pack whine and act nervous... Its all very very interesting!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Dog communication... I wish I understood it better... I just love love love watching the way they interact and communicate with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Had a scary moment today.... Sasha actually went INTO monets box today.... I was sitting right beside the box texting on my phone and didnt notice she went in there.UNTIL... An explosion of screaming and growling	attacking made me litterally drop my phone, jump over the box, grab monet by the nape of her neck to pull her off whomever was in there.... It was sasha..who was cornered in the back of the box being viciously attacked.... No way to get out... holy shit...<p>&nbsp;</p>Poor girl... Shes fine... no blood or marks... Bindi never even woke up through that... <p>&nbsp;</p>Sash should have known better than to do that... They all know monet growls if they come close to her box.. Thats another thing... They understand different growls... Some growls they just respond normally to, other growls make them stop dead in thier tracks, turn straight around and move away... <p>&nbsp;</p>They all know not to go near monets box... I ve seen her warn each and every one of them... I dont think she'll do that again.... <p>&nbsp;</p>Ok.. bedtime... Bacteria lab in the morning... Cant wait....

Holy shit!&nbsp;&nbsp; I go over a whole swatch with the big cleaner, water only, and when I see soap bubbles coming up from a spot, I stop and get on my hands and knees with the hand tool part and scrub scrub scrub until the water is coming up the hose without being soapy.... Im exhausted... been at it a couple hours now... Not even half way done yet.... This room is huge!<p>&nbsp;</p>While I was scrubbing like that, I realized that I can probably still use oxi clean, but I have to use it together with the steam cleaner hand tool.&nbsp; Make sure no soap is left in the carpet... No more of that saturating a spot, leaving it over night and going half assed over it with the big steam cleaner... <p>&nbsp;</p>I think going foreward... if I see a spot I will spray (not saturate) it, then just leave it on 10 minutes or so, then hit it with the hand tool, set on hot water only, until water comes up soap free... And be sure the cant get in the area till its oxi free.... <p>&nbsp;</p>There just isnt another product that I know of that works like oxi clean.... I must have tried them all over the years.... Black lights dont lie.... You clean a spot with oxi clean and its GONE litterally.. Not a trace shows under the black light.... Every other product might&nbsp; look like it works in regular light... But under a black light you will still see the stain... <p>&nbsp;</p>I still want to use the product... just have to be smarter about it... <p>&nbsp;</p>Sophies breathing was very much improved last night when she slept..&nbsp; Benedryl did help... She was still a little stuffy, but it wasnt painful for me to watch her trying to breathe.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Well, mother nature is helping me out with getting the oxi clean out, the back half of my room is flooded...

"event","<p><br>I always thought that a dog shouldnt be bred every heat cycle...But after some conversations with other breeders, I have learned thats not correct at all.....
 http://www.bijoupoodles.com/ 

 the latest AKC breeders symposium, studies were presented showing that its actually harder on the dog to be bred every other cycle... Because of the hormone levels and changes in the uterus that happen when the bitch is in heat and doesnt get bred.&nbsp; It says its healthier for the bitch to be bred every heat cycle during her breeding career.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dont skip cycles... <p>&nbsp;</p>Thats long been the standard, breed a cycle, rest a cycle... This isnt natural for the dogs reproductive system... A dog should be spayed or bred, but not left to be in heat without breeding.&nbsp; 	That makes sense.... It also answered the question in my own mind, Is monet too old to be having pups?&nbsp; No she isnt... Considering the lifespan of a chihuahua can be 15-19 years... 6 is not old at all... Mabe for a large breed dog that has a shorter lifespan and births larger litters, 6 would be old... But wow..&nbsp; Learned some things... Good things.. :)<p>&nbsp;</p>When monet is spayed I'm going to ask them to let me know about the condition of her uterus... I have a few questions... I wish I watch the spay and see for myself... Mabe?? Ill ask...

"event","<p>ok... I just did a bunch of research.... Oxi clean.... wonderful product... seriously... It works... But its 65% sodium carbonate which is known to cause ""respiratory tract irritation, damage to the nasel septum, coughing and difficulty breathing if inhaled... <p>&nbsp;</p>It also has exthoxylated alcohol c12 -c16.&nbsp; This compound is created with ethylene oxide that is classified as a known human carcinogen..It can cause ""gastrointestinal irritation, redness,&nbsp; respiratory irritation, skin inflamation, corneal inflamation and reproductive problems""<p>&nbsp;</p>well well well.... then the other ingredients were all tied to gastro intestional irritations among other things...

This is not cool!!!&nbsp; I love love love oxi clean.... Its my miracle product... <p>&nbsp;</p>As far as the lump on her back, I did a bunch of research on that too and I think what it is, is a reaction to her shot... She did get lepto for the first time last vet visit... Lots of dogs have reactions to that in the form of a lump on their back at the vaccination spot... Thats where the lump is, so Im going to say..&nbsp; I THINK I figured out my own problems... .. I gotta get these carpets cleaned again with water only....immediately!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>You know the steam cleaner water is very hot and steams up my mirrors when Im cleaning... so all that steam in the air probably has oxi clean fumes in it too... <p>&nbsp;</p>Poooor little sophie...

Like shes straining to a breath in when shes sleeping.. I googled all the symptoms and what it most sounds like to me is a collapsed trachea.. FUCK!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Im broke as hell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank god Ive been dropping extra money at the vet for monets spay/dental...

Taking a breath in seems waaaaay to labored, like her airways in her nose are almost completely clogged... <p>&nbsp;</p>I hope its just some type of reaction to all the stuff Ive cleaned the carpets with lately... Im trying to think did all this start after I went a little crazy with the oxi clean on the carpets	the other day?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats a definate possibility... And I hope thats the problem, rather than a collapsed trachea... <p>&nbsp;</p>I watched a video of a dog with a collapsed trachea on you tube... It literally is exactly what I see in sophie right now so Im a little freaked out... <p>&nbsp;</p>Freaked out because it sounds like treatments might or might not work.. only 70% improve with treatment... <br>Fuck!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

In english I imagine it would translate into, 'pleeeeeeeease make it stooooooooop' . <br>So I just shot a full syringe of pepto bismal down her throat...&nbsp; about 0.9 ml's...&nbsp; She whined and looked painful for about 5 more minutes...Its started kicking in now... Her tummy us still gurgling, but the sounds are pretty muffled now, and shes stopped whining, shes layed down resting now... :(&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Pepto always helps... Monet is getting ready to drop her pups, Im starting to see signs of pre labor... And shes oozing... Its too dark in here for me to tell the exact color shade of the ooze... Which would really let me know how much longer its going to be... Monet has birthed all but one of her litters between 7-9pm on her exact due date.. Once she went into labor about 5am.... But shes pretty consistant with her birthing routine.... So I guess that means I'm expecting her pups Wed evening...&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>I still havent found her big box yet... The one she turned her nose up at is still here... She hasnt even went inside of it even one time!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today thats my goal.... I HAVE to find a box big enough.... TODAY!&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually she would have retreated into her box by now to rest and get it ready... <p>&nbsp;</p>Ugh, is that a ice storm I see out the window?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh fabulous!&nbsp; Drive safe! .</p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

I couldnt do the dog thing... <br>So it started in the morning with me discovering they had been chewing up my shoes... 1shoe each of FOUR pairs, 2 I hadnt even worn yet... Then it was indy attacking sasha, makibg her yelp, then it was indy pissing on the floor, then it was lucy pissing on the floor, then I dont know which one of them stole my steak off my plate.. Then its sasha running and taking a flying leap straight into a kinda large, full water bowl... Making a tidal wave of water all over the place....At least I already had the steam cleaner out.... <p>&nbsp;</p>Sprinkled in between all that was me constantly yelling at indy about growling at the pups.... or yelling at lucy to quit chewing something, or yelling at indy to quit fucking stealing all the bones and putting them out of reach!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Im just..... pissed!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of them better dare get in my bed tonight.... Everyone is sleeping in their own beds!&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Since I just saw 2 dogs piss on the floor today, I decided to get the black light out when it got dark.... see if there were any spots that I didnt know about.... <p>&nbsp;</p>*JESUS CHRIST Man..... My floor looked like a fucking leopard!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>I just went around and doused every spot I saw with heavy oxi clean... which I'll let soak overnight, in the morning Ill be doing a major steam cleaning.... I had never looked at the floor in here under a blacklight before, so I dont know how old all the spots are, but I am 100% completely grossed out!&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>*sigh.... Not a good dog day today... <br>: \</p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

"event","<p><br>So yesterday I was at soldans, I went kinda first thing in the morning, when I walked in there was one employee on the salesfloor.&nbsp; She was wheeling the feed cart through the small animal area, feeding and watering the small animals.&nbsp; I was the only customer in the store.&nbsp; I walked around for a bit, getting my usual supply of food, bully sticks and a new toy.&nbsp; I walk up to the counter, stand there for a bit as the employee calls over from the small animal area that she would be right with me.&nbsp; I was like ""no hurry""..... I dropped my stuff on the counter and walked over to chit chat w her and look at the small animals.<p>&nbsp;</p>I walked over to the small rat tank and asked if I coukd get one out?&nbsp;&nbsp; She said ""sure, we just got a shipment of new ones""... I looked in and noticed one looked REALLY small, and REALLY skinny... I reached in to pick her up.&nbsp; Once she was in my hand I could see she was obviously too ypung to be away from mom, she was skinny so you could feel her whole skeleton.&nbsp; She was dehydrated and lethargic.. I showed her to the lady and asked if they had any nursing mothers in the store?&nbsp;&nbsp; No they didnt, and she said she didnt know why the breeder would ship them that young.&nbsp; She would call about it. <p>&nbsp;</p> I noticed that there was no food and an empty water bottle in their tank.&nbsp; I threw some seed in their bowl and lab blocks from the feed cart. I filled their water bottle and watched while 7 baby rats all tried to drink thirstily from one dripper.&nbsp; :/&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>The baby in my hand was also very very thirsty.&nbsp; And not old enough to eat lab blocks.&nbsp; Barely if at all old enough to eat seed... She tried in my hand to nibble a seed, but couldnt..There were 2.&nbsp; Two that were just barely past fuzzy stage, with no mom.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>And as I watched the baby rats, I glanced in the mouse tank next to it, saw a dead mouse laying on the bedding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached in and shook the water bottle.... Empty...&nbsp; No food in the tank.... As I noticed each thing I mentioned it to the employee.&nbsp; ""Hey, these guys dont have any water""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and ""hey, look at how thirsty they were"" after I filled thier bottle and they were going crazy trying to jostle for a drink.&nbsp; <br>She swore she filled all the water bottles the night before.&nbsp; Right before she left!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mm hmmm, and I was born yesterday!	 How I didnt come home with those two babys&nbsp; I dont know.&nbsp; Their just going to die in that tank... They arent old enough to be away from the mom.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Well WTF soldans??? 	&nbsp; </p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

Not to drink, so I bring her water to her every half hour or so...not to go out..I have to physically pick her up and carry her out.&nbsp; She will go potty and littetally sprint back to her pups.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its really sweet how attentive she is.&nbsp; </p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

I wanted 150$ for it, he talked me down to 125$$.  He said hes going to use it in his races tomorrow..  He rides 4 different races tomorrow.  He made a deal that if my vest brings him luck to win tomorrow hes going to up the price by 25$ for each race he wins..lol... Yeah, Im going to watch the races tomorrow... Haha..I'll be waiting in the winners circle for ya with my hand outstretched octavio! Hope he wins a couple!

"event","Hello old journal.  I need to vent.  I really need to vent.  So here I am.  I have been fired from my job.  It all started back in July 11.  My boss and I had this group of juvenilles under surveillance.  Long story short.. They pushed out a cartload of merchandise without paying.  I went to stop them and they all fled in different directions.  My boss was keeping one in sight when the kid (14 years old) jumped off the 3rd level of our parking structure and fell 3 stories to the cement.  He ended up breaking both legs, pelvis, concussion.  Of course we were accused of 'chasing' this kid.  That is NOT what happened at all.  Noone was chasing anyone. When a thief is fleeing and we have the police on the line we are only trying to keep them in sight to relay direction of flight to responding officers.   Well my boss who was an execuitive with the company for 25 years was fired over that incident.  And I very nearly got fired but was able to defend my actions sufficiently to retain my job.  So from july to November I was the boss.  

Fast foreward to November 2011.  I caught another 35 people without incident in that 4 months. Well then they finally hired a new guy to come be my new boss.  A few days after his arrival I was fired.  I was fired because I stopped a guy pushing a laundry hamper full of 400$ worth of deodarant out the door without paying.  

I had seen the guy walk in the store with nothing, I had seen him shopping in certain areas as I walked around the store on routine patrol.  Later when I saw him with a laundry hamper FULL of merchandise.  Then I saw him put the lid on the hamper and push it down real tight.  
(this was when I knew he was going to steal and began surveillance on him)
Then as I followed along behind him he pushed the whole thing right out the door.  I stopped him.  The dude was HUGE and simply pushed me out of the way and ran. I didn't follow behind but just brought the cart and merchandise back to the office.  At the time I fully expected to walk into the office with the recovered merchandise and have my new boss be super happy and telling me good job.  Instead he asked me if I had seen the guy select any of that merchandise?  I said not exactly but I saw ENOUGH to know that was our merchandise and he was stealing it.  So I stopped him.  That is my job after all to stop shoplifters.  Well I was fired the next day.   

So stupid!  As a security guard if I had let that guy walk out the door with $400 worth of stolen merchandise I would still have my job today.  Bunch of BULLSHIT!  Luckily unemployment did an investigation and determined I was termed without just cause and gave 50 weeks of unemployment.  So Im unemployed now. I think after the incident in july they were just looking to get rid of me.   

I am broke, alone, unemployed, and just at a very low point in my life.  I mean I have been in a low point mentally for what seems like most of my life.. I honestly feel like I don't have much longer to suffer.  If any of you know me personally you know that I have suffered with anorexia for pretty much my entire adult life.  Only the short time when I was pursuing being a jockey was I able to feel happy and gain a normal body weight.  But I think that years and decades of daily starvation and punishment to my body is really taking its toll now..    I feel mentally broken and full of hate and rage.  I feel the strongest hate and rage towards myself.  Which makes it really easy to starve and punish myself.  My reality is that now I am too physically and mentally broken to help myself or even care much, and there litterally isn't anyone to help me.  I think if anyone tried I would probably push them away... 
 I am perfectly content to lay and spend the entire day crying.  Crying, smoking and starving... I have actually over the years learned to enjoy the feeling of hunger pangs..  Every hunger pang litterally makes me feel like the end of my suffering is getting closer..

its only a matter of time now.."

"event","<p>Today, while I'm thinking of it I'm going to write about some of things that seem to happen to me just because I'm white and live in Cleveland.&nbsp; <lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p>The worst thing happened a few years back when I had only been in Cleveland a few months, still very sweet and nieve, kind and friendly to everyone, didnt see the color of anyones skin, just the person you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Im standing beside my vehicle pumping gas.&nbsp; Only myself and one other vehicle a couple slots over pumping their gas.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the sudden I hear the man from the other vehicle calling to me..&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Hey white bitch......WHITE BITCH............HEY LITTLE WHITE BITCH, I KNOW YOU HEAR ME LITTLE WHITE BITCH....TURN AROUND WHITE BITCH.....just on and on...and on...the whole time I pumped my gas...The more I ignored it the louder he got....<p>&nbsp;</p>I had my back to him and never turned around.&nbsp; I stood there my eyes huge, scared, not knowing what to do...go in the gas station, tell the black cashier someone is harassing me outside..cashier just looks at me dead in the face, real serious..not even acknowledging that I just spoke to him.&nbsp; Never uttered one word my entire transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got in my car, got home and told felipe what had happened and my reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was pissed at me that I just let it happen, I should have turned around and stoid up for myself he said... He was always telling me I was weak and let people just cross the line with me, that I never stood up for myself...<p>&nbsp;</p><br>Then there was another racial incident when I worked at target in Bedford, the one across the street from the walmart referenced in yesterdays post.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>I was a security guard, in a police looking uniform, walking around my store on routine patrol.. I happen to walk past a woman talking on her cellphone, a black woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I walk past I hear her telling whomever she was talking to that she couldnt find something she was looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking only of trying to be helpful, I stopped, very sweetly with a smile told her, oh you know we have another display of those cell phone cases over in another location.....I start to point over to where they are.... as she snaps viciously at me...'did I ask for your help'?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she litterally launched into a full on verbal racial attack against me, something about this isnt a plantation and something about Ishmael.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was stunned and in tears as I said back to her 'this isnt a black and white thing, your a human being, Im a human being and I was only trying to help you and your being very nasty to me'<p>&nbsp;</p>She just kept on till I was in tears and she had to be asked to leave the store.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no clue what had just happened, and who the hell is Ishmael?&nbsp;&nbsp; My boss explained me something about the bible and racism or something.... I just never knew the world to be like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>I got home that night and told felipe what had hapoened and once again he was pissed at me, yelling at me saying that I shouldnt take that, and whats wrong with me that I never stand up for myself....I just felt so attacked by everyone...I wasnt thst person...<p>&nbsp;</p>I thought racism was horrible and evil..And only very dumb, uneducated, ignorant people could even be that way... I see humans as humans, color makes no difference, every person is different and should be... To me at that time racism was such a sad thing.....<p>&nbsp;</p>Those are my only two BLATENT incidents of racism....Everything else is just everyday and slightly passive... Like going through a drive through if a black cashier is handing me my food its usually with a stone face and never a word spoken...&nbsp; If its at a store, I will be in a checkout waiting in line watching the cashier greet and chit chat in a friendly mannef all the black people she checks out ahead of me then not speak a single word to me when its my turn, no hello, no smile, just the stone face I am very accustomed to now...every now again one is a little nastier than is normal... Over time, now, Im sick of it and dont deal with it well....<p>&nbsp;</p>Its crazy because I still remember being the scared girl not knowing what do do.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still remember the feeling of how I used to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Now Im accustomed to living in a world full if people I cannot trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; Im accustomed to and prepared to stand up for myself at any moment.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p>Theres no question or hesitation of what I would do now if some asshole tries to harass me while Im pumping my gas.....Oh yes I would turn around.....&nbsp; Thats what I mean when I say this city has changed me.&nbsp; <br>I dont hate black people, not at all, just the opposite...I am however very VERY aware how of how much they hate me..Its really sad.&nbsp; But just the way it is here...&nbsp; </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p>"

Got my new car.. an 06 Nissan Maxima.. Black.. tinted windows.  It drives soooo nice.  Sooo much nicer than my old car.  I miss my old car though.. I don't know why I get attached to vehicles.. probably stupid and pointless.. 

Oh.. its change I hate.  Thats what it is.. 

So wow.. new home, new car, new job..  

I made a list at the end of last year.  A list of things I needed to get accomplished for myself and all of those things were on my list.  Felipe is still drifting in and out of my life.  But he isn't around here anymore, he's moved to Philadelphia.  So for the most part I am completely on my own now.. For the first time in a very long time... 

It feels good but sydney is not here.. She is still living with my parents and has no intention of coming to live with me.   I understand, all her friends and family are there and she is living a rich spoiled life.  Life with me would be a poor life.. I try to be there for her as much as I can but she really shuts me out, convinced that I abandoned her.  When in reality I feel like she chooses to stay there rather than coming to live with me, which she has always had the option to do.. 

I never would have predicted myself and sydney to be so torn apart..  I cry almost every morning over it.. for some reason its the first thing to pop into my brain the moment I wake up almost every morning.. 

Caught another shoplifter a couple of nights ago.   Another action packed adventure of a case.. haha.. She was a known repeat offender who comes in and gets alot of merchandise off the floor and returns it.  

 so when an employee came and told me she was in the store I went right out and picked up live floor surveillance on her.  I followed her around the store for an hour and fourty minutes before she ended up at guest service with her cart LOADED with merchandise I had seen her select.   From where I was watching her from I could see her putting stuff up on the counter but I couldn't hear if she was buying or returning.. So I walked up behind the counter and asked the cashier if she was returning merchandise.  I then took over the transaction and told the woman she would have to wait because I had to go review video before I could approve the return.  
I stepped away for a few moments and pretty soon the woman just pushed the cart FULL of merchandise right out the door.   So I grabbed her and brought her and her 390 bucks worth of stolen merchandise back in.  It was a 60 year old woman that had been hitting us for YEARS.   My coworker saw her doing the same thing the other night and TOLD her to leave all the merchandise we weren't returning ANY of it.  So she was dumb enough to try it again right away and got busted... 

so yeah.. life is going on.."

Also terminated an employee today.  The day before yesterday she found another employees bank card in the break room and used it, overdrew that employees account.  She was dumb enough to use it in our store for 3 different transactions so it was so easy to pull video and build the case.  So today when we pulled her and sat her down for her interview and started asking her about why she thinks she might be in here talking with us today and whatnot she admitted to TONS of other things.  Things along the lines of theft of merchandise, return fraud and consumption of food. So we ask is there anything else?  We didn't even know about all that stuff.. We were still waiting for her to admit to the bankcard.  It took a while but she finally admitted to that as well.  

Poor girl.. She was a single mom with a new baby and on her own.  She was taking things like clothing and food for her baby.  Unfortunate but now shes unemployed as well and facing a felony for using a stolen credit card.  :( 

Caught 2 shoplifters yesterday.  <lj-cut> 


2 14 year old girls..  I first saw them in jewelry carrying big bags.. So I started shopping next to them here and there.. I noticed them keep looking at me.  So I left the area and went to wait over to intimates where I had a feeling would be where they would steal all the jewelry they were selecting.  

Sure enough my camera person soon let me know they were coming right to me. We don't have camera coverage of intimates so I had to make sure I saw everything..

 As I sat concealed in my little hiding spot I had a perfect visual as I watched them rip the tags off jewelry, sunglasses, a dozen bra's and matching panties, some boxers and just LOAD up their bags.  I had to change positions several times because they kept sweeping the area on lookout..They even saw me several times but I just played it off like I was shopping and talking on the phone.  But really I was talking to my camera man.  haha... So then they eventually put their bags back on their shoulders and head for the elevator to go up to the second level.  I notified my camera person that I had seen everything and keep them in view, I was going to the door.  

As soon as they couldn't see me, I sprinted for the doors and ran outside and up 2 flights of stairs to the upper level and was waiting outside the exit doors where they couldn't see me.  My camera person soon let me know they were coming for the doors.  They no sooner had one foot out the door when I stepped around the corner and right in front of them and as I was telling them to turn around and come back inside my camera person, who had run for the door right when they started going out the first exit doors, runs up and sweeps in from behind and BAM.. Caught.  I grab both bags off their shoulders and before they know whats happening we have them by the arms and are walking back in.   Textbook.. that one was pretty textbook.. 

Even the girls were impressed, one girl said I thought about running but thought you guys might have people set up around the parking lot.  haha.. 

Now I'm home alone in my own place.  I have the next couple of days off.. I think I am going to go look at new cars tomorrow.  310 dollars my ass.. I think its time to trade my old car in.  Shes lasted me 9 years.. Hmm... Same amount of time I have had this journal.  Yeah... I got my car and started this journal around the same time.  Now my poor old journal is neglected and my car is falling apart.   Litterally.  

I want a nissan maxima.  Mabe an 06 or 07.. I dunno.. we'll see I guess.. 

OH.. if you read all my drama this far, check out this absolutely HILARIOUS fool that was on the news the other night.   THIS IS the kind of place I live in... THESE are the kind of people I am surrounded by and deal with every day.  People just like the Dodsons.   Which I guess is why I find it so funny.  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE0LRjQkWKk   OMG I crack up every time I watch that.. 

Well.. I haven't eaten anything in almost 2 days now.. Hunger.. my old and constant companion.. I don't know why I all the time starve myself when I'm feeling hopeless about my life.. for days, weeks, frequently months of barely eating anything more a bite here and there..Getting terribly skinny, seeing all my bones when I look in the mirror.. seeing circles around my eyes and sunken eyes, adding notches to my belts, clothes looking way too big even though they are size 0 or XS. I see all this and I still don't want to eat anything.. I am just a messed up person.. 

 I think its my way of trying to die a little sooner.. I don't know..those things have been a constant all my life, since some of my youngest memories, wanting to die and starving myself..  At this point in my life I fear I am just too messed up and will never be ok..

"event","Deep Breathing sigh******   

I remember many years ago, trapped at steves house, I was wishing and wishing so hard I had my own place and could just go home to my own home, shut the front door and curl up on my own couch. Be in peace..I guess that was about 5 or 6 years ago now.  And many many MANY times since then I have wished for the same thing.   I went right from steve to felipe and never had any time of my own in all that time.. Lost my daughter along the way.. 

Have been in absolute hell with felipe for who knows how long.   Struggling, suffering, in absolute misery, I feel completely broken again..   WEll.. <lj-cut>

I finally did it.. I left felipe, bought my own place, and now here I sit all alone in my own house... Its been 2 months.. 

The thing is.. I bought the place next door to him.  It sounds crazy I know but this is how that came to be... one night following a huge fight and me feeling like I had taken all I can take and had to go somewhere NOW.  I wanted felipe to leave.  He had really no reason to stay here, he can go anywhere.. Me on the other hand.. I have a job here that I make pretty decent money and this place is CHEAP.  SUPER cheap.. So I knew the people next door and they were moving, their place was available and very easy for me to move all my stuff.  

Since I am here in this city completely alone with no friends or family to help me with anything it was just the most comfortable move for me.   I figure felipe wont be around long anyways.. He always goes away for the winter somewhere and I'm sure he will be gone very soon.  Summer is almost over.  

At the time when I started moving, felipe helped me move, then for the first month we were in this wierd place where it was like we were still together but just living next door to each other.. 

Then one night we went out to dinner and I sat across from him listening to him go on and on about things I just did NOT want to hear.. He was going on and on about 'american people' as he frequently did.  But it was offensive and I always get so annoyed with him as he's yacking on and on about how messed up all american people are and all our systems.  Every sentence starts with 'you guys' as if I am lumped in with everything he dislikes about america.   

I started acting visibly annoyed and asked him to change the subject.. So he starts going on about something else equally annoying.. THen I started realizing that EVERY single conversation we have was either him telling me what TO do or telling me what NOT to do.   

By the time my food came I was not hungry and barely ate 2 bites.  He then got pissed at ME because I didn't eat my dinner and that must mean I'm smoking.  He then started being a total ass.. I left the table and went to the lobby to wait for him to pay the bill..  He payed and walked past me, opening the door, walking out right in front of me and let it shut in my face.  RIght in front of everyone in the lobby.   After a ride home in silence, I went to my place and he went to his.  

We didn't talk for a couple days, then I get home from work and sit down on my back porch steps and am smoking a cigerette.  He walked up on my porch unexpectedly and saw me smoking.  It was the first time in our entire 5 years together that he had ever seen me smoke.  He just took the key to my house off his keyring, threw it at me, told me to have a nice life and turned and walked away.   I called over my shoulder as he was walking away.. 'YOU TOO'.  I have not spoken to him since.  

He has been over a few times, knocking on my door, bringing stuff of mine and leaving it on my porch. Once I cracked the door open a little, but I didn't look at him.. He told me he wasn't my enemy, I just nodded and closed the door..   I never look at him and certainly never speak to him.  I can't even bring myself to look at him.  I am so filled with anger and disappointment.  And I hate to admit it. But I still love him.. I love him and HATE him at the same time.  Its a very wierd place to be in.  I never have had to deal with lingering feelings at the end of a relationship.  

And living next door.. just imagine.  Its wierd.. just wierd.  I always find myself running to peek out windows when I hear him, wondering what hes doing and where hes going, wondering if hes seeing anyone else yet.  Just driving my mind crazy, then every time I catch myself like I'm missing him I start remembering some horrible thing he did or said and I get so ANGRY and hurt and send him to hell, remind myself that I NEVER want to see him again and go about my business.  I feel like I'm going crazy because its such a rapidly repeating cycle. Depending on what minute of the day it is, I'm either crying missing him or remembering something and hating him. Feeling my blood boil at some of my memories.. Then feeling my heart breaking so hard that all my dreams are gone.. just gone. I sacraficed so much and loved so hard and now I'm alone.. all alone.. as alone as someone can be.   

I feel stuck here because of my job.. I love my job.  I am doing really REALLY well.. Apparently I have a knack for catching shoplifters.  

And theres my family..    No not tonight.. thats too much to get into..   

I hope felipe leaves soon.  At the same time, I'm scared of when he leaves because then I'm completely alone... Here in CLEVELAND.  which might as well be Detroit. I don't even have anyone to call if I get stranded somewhere or something happens.  Its scary for me to think of.. All my old ghosts are still there apparently.. Feeling so tiny and vulnerable if anyone knows I am alone.   

I'm going through some crazy shit mentally these days.  I need to recover.. again.. 

So thats a little about where I'm at right now.  At least I'm home.. in my own place, even if its a cheap piece of shit in the ghetto, at least its mine.. And I have my job.  Mabe I will write more often now."

Last night I was cleaning up the kitchen, making all sorts of racket, putting dishes away, had the tv on, just lots of noise.  Well my two dogs were laying in their bed sound asleep in the other room, right next to a blaring tv.  They were seemingly oblivious to all the noise UNTIL.... 

I looked at them sleeping soundly and, purely for my own amusment picked up a potato chip piece that was on the counter and threw it on the floor just to see if the sound of a chip hitting the floor would wake them up.   

HECK YEAH, that chip no sooner hit the floor when both their eyes snapped open and they both scurried into the kitchen.. HAHAHAHAHAHa..   

In other news, Today marks 3 weeks that I have not talked to felipe.   Still feeling SO good about my new found independance.   LOVING it..  He did call the other day.  But he said 'I just wanted to see how your doing' I snapped 'I'm doing just FINE'  and hung up the phone.  

A new job opportunity has opened up for me here so I'll see what happens with that over the next few weeks.    Still no internet at home but otherwise all is WELL!!"

One night last week, while there was no security schedueled these 2 guys came in and robbed us BLIND.  Stole about 700$ worth of electronics..  I discovered it the next day when the counts of things I inventory each day were off.  Upon reviewing video I found out who stole the merchandise.  

Then while reviewing video and accidently punching in the wrong date we discovered the same 2 guys had hit us the previous night as well.  From then on we knew they would be back and we have been watching for them.  For the past week they have been our 'most wanted'

Today was the day they came back.  They were seperated in different areas of the store and we were trying to keep them both under surveillance at the same time which is NO easy thing to do.   So we see the one load up and head for the doors.  My boss and I stop him and are escorting him back to our office when he breaks away and flees towards the door.  My boss caught him and grabbed his coat, I was right behind them and by the time I got 2 steps and almost had my hands on him he broke away again and fled across the parking lot with me in pursuit.  Well he ran across the road and tried to jump a 5 ft tall snowbank and fell.  By the time he got back up I was ducked behind another snowbank, the police on the line giving them his description and direction of flight.  He looks back and can't see me behind the snow bank so he thinks hes gotten away, that noone is following him.  Then the police pull up.. he starts running again.. they tackle him, handcuff him and bring him and all the stolen merchandise back to me.  

So while I was outside securing the capture of that guy, my boss had went back in to keep surveillance of the other guy who was still in the store loading up with video games and movies.

So then the second guy tries to walk out and walks right into the waiting group of police officers.    

Thats how we do it here.   bag em and tag em.. hahaha. 

Then a couple of hours later I see a teenaged girl stealing 2 sweaters.  I stopped her and got her back in my office and it was pretty quiet and routine.  She was shopping with her great grandmother so she wasn't about to try anything.  

Whew.. busy adrenaline filled day.. LOVE days like this."

Picture this.. girl sitting, mother standing over her leaning down so her face is RIGHT in the girls face screaming at the top of her lungs...'YOU DUMB BITCH, YOU STUPID DUMB MOTHER FUCKING BITCH.  I MAY BE ALOT OF BITCHES BUT I AIN'T NEVER BEEN A DUMB BITCH.  IS THIS WHO YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING? THESE DIRTY NIGGERS THAT WASH THEIR ASSES IN THE KITCHEN SINK.  THEY ARE JUST PIMPING YOU, THEY STICK THEIR DICKS IN EVERY OTHER HOE OUT THERE AND USE YOU TO STEAL.  YOU DUMB BITCH.  DID YOU TELL THESE PEOPLE YOU LIVE IN A 400 THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE, THAT YOU HAVE A CAR AND AN APARTMENT. DID YOU TELL THEM ALL THIS?  DID YOU TELL THEM I JUST GOT YOU A 400$ COAT?   GIVE ME THAT COAT.   (she took the girls coat, her phone and took her gucci purse too) 

I can't remember all of what she said, since it went on for over 45 minutes, but basicly she was just spewing profanity.  Then she just started beating the shit out of the girl.. She litterally beat the piss out of her.. gave her a black eye, had her by her shirt throwing her into the walls and scared the girl so bad she actually pissed herself in my office.  

Apparently the girl had been complaining because her family moved and she wasn't able to hang out with her old hoodlum friends.  

We were all so stunned we didn't know what to do, we generally don't get involved with parents discliplining their delinquint children.. I mean obviously parents are going to be pissed when they find out their children are stealing  But OMG.. I couldn't sleep last night.. We should have done something.. We didn't realize she pissed herself until after they had left.. 

Then I started thinking about how scared someone has to be to piss themself?  Only in life and death situations when you are fearing for your life could that happen.. 

I will never let that happen again.  I have seen some parents do some off the wall stuff.. but that was way over the top.  I should have pulled the mother into another room and tried to talk to her.. mother to mother.. As angry and ghetto as she was I don't know that it would have done any good and may have put ME in danger, but it might have..    WOW.. I thought it was bad when one parent made her 17 year old son strip down to his underwear right in front of me.. But this.. I don't think it gets any worse than that without it becoming a punishable crime.  Poor girl.. I shudder to think what the mother did to her when they left.  


And in other news, tomorrow will be NINE days since felipe has called me.. To him I say.. FUCK you and your silent treatment.  

I feel so GOOD not talking to him.. I feel like I'm working towards my way out and doing so happily, I feel empowered and independant (alot of that I can thank you guys for)  

If I talk to him I just know that somehow hes going to mess with my brain and before the end of the conversation he will be telling me to get the fuck out and I will be trying to convice him how much I love him.. 

And I don't get how this happens I really don't.. His voice in my ear is dangerous right now.. so I hope and pray that he doesn't call or if he does that I just hit that one little button on my phone 'ignore'... The best thing is if I don't talk to him till after I'm gone..

And I don't have internet access at home right now.. so I'll respond to stuff when I can.. :)"

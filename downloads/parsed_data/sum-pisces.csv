On the back of the picture is this inscription: 'Remus Rodham; horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial&nbsp; Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.'</p><p>Judy e-mailed Hillary Clinton for information about her great-great uncle. Hillary's staff sent back the following biographical sketch: <br />'Remus Rodham was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory.&nbsp; His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.'&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />NOW THAT is how it's done folks!</p>"

"event","hi
im back
we have internet as of yesterday so happy again. also wanting to save about 5 or 6 thousand dollars by march (possible, very possible. im pretty sure anyway) so that i can tell peg on her birthday that we have enough savings to seriously start thinking about starting a family. she said&nbsp; 5000, see. i figured that'd be a nice birthday present for her. this is as well as saving for myself AND for a house. and paying rent to the owner of the house which happens to be my dad so yeah. straight into the mortgage account, cheaters. still. 
had an electrician through to fix a couple of things and my sister's ex (my sister is driving now. she has her ps. very scary) has finished his building apprenticeship and is going to fix a couple of things up as well. work is v v busy, permanent overtime and this is the christmas rush, already. crazy stuff.
oh and another scary thing? my sister (same sister) has this gr 12 drama assignment where she has to pick a theatre genre that's common in our society (she chose pantomime), perform a scene in that genre and do a write up for which she has to call, i quote, an experienced professional. she called me. ME. apparently im an experienced professional when it comes to pantomime, which is flattering and slightly scary. and so not true. 
rock nativity is going really really really (insert several more 'really's) well. still got heaps of music to learn but so good&nbsp;so far. brisbane ppl will see it. but book now cos there's already one show booked out. amazing cast. amazing director. she has a 10-month-old boy and he's SO cute and hes a snuggler and yes ive had a very bad case of babies on the brain lately. 
i bought a bday present for another of my sisters today. really nice watch. also needed a new bag and new shoes and they had this thing where you got a second pair for half price so i did. got shoes for work and some nice casual men's shoes. seriously for a non girly girl i am hugely into shoes. so many pairs of shoes. i also bought copies of my two favourite dr seuss books which are fox in sox and one fish two fish red fish blue fish. totally awsome books. 
there's probably more but there you go. 
ok i should go. just thought id let you know im back. not that anyone wouldve noticed id gone anyway."

and i got a drill. it's totally awsome. ive wanted one of them for ages
and now im going to post a notice on brisbane auditions saying i need a pianist for a show. oh and possibly going to have a band. sally didnt realise or had forgotten or something that shed ordered the band parts, so we have parts for drums, guitar and bass or bass guitar. is very very cool. now need to contact the director and tell her that and then work out what we can have and what she wants. and stuff. 
yes, so.

anyway.
im also getting lonely. the whole no uni and no theatre (for a while anyway) means no social life and im bored. i&nbsp; love living with peg, thats not the problem. i just need something to DO. so im sending out a plea to anyone who doesn't have plans for saturday during the day- neither do i and i want some. please help me make someone.

man i sound so desperate. bloody hell.

ok. other news. saw a mouse at work todya. zoomed out from under my bag when i picked it up to go home, went through a pipe and then behind a cabinet thing on the wall. so. mice in the lunch room which is right next to the display room. and customers (including ones from interstate) coming tomorrow, friday and possibly saturday. no pressure. they are also going to be shown around the factory. no extra pressure. shame i wore my most interesting pants today. it's giong to have to be the orange ones tomorrow. the ones i painted my name on when i was waiting for tghe painit to dry on the kettle for mother goose. ha. ""this is emily. she's new (one month, almost) and has wierd dress sense."" and did 164 frames today (and almost finished another 4. damn that buzzer). aim is 200. go me. how proud am i of myself. 4 sessions, right. each 2 hours, give or take ten minutes. 47, 35, 44, 38. best day yet.&nbsp;

other aim, of course, is a home loan in about a year and first appointment at the fertility clinic as soon as we can after settling in at the new house. haven't talked t peg about the second bit specifically but that seems to be the general consensus.

"event","peg's dog buddy got a bath today. that was interesting.
piano exam on the 15th of may. damn im tense about that. i would be practising right now except peg's napping. dont want to wake her but desperate to practise.
seeing the truth on thursday. will be interesting. cos charlotte's web has been performing while theyve been rehearsing so not only have i heard a few things about it, not all of tehm good but anyway. one thing that im not sure is good or bad. and&nbsp;i have SEEN the progress of the printing press being built. my lights/sound op (the other guy could only do until the end of teh holidays) is the new set construction guy so it's been interesting.&nbsp;
on that topic, i dont think im that bad an SM. not brilliant, but good enough to know that I CAN DO IT. and that is a good feeling.
still looking for a job. applied for one that closes on may 5. dont think ill get it tho. government library job and here i am with no qualifications of any sort except that im doing this advanced level on piano. maybe i should teach privately.
having an issue with my phone. apparently the $29 thing with vodaphone doesnt include particular kinds of texting that the $30 optus thing does. damn optus being sold out of all the good phones. cos they had the same phone that i got from vodaphone. maybe i should just spend the $75 and get it swapped to optus. after 6 months it's less but its annoying me./
i didnt tell you that did i? yeah new phone. old one got stolen. dad bought me a new one. same number. most bloody stressed and upset ive ever been. seriously. few weeks ago now. didnt feel like posting about it at teh time.
judge judy is on soon. then peg had better wake up cos i need to practise. going in to practise on teh piano im doing the exam on on thursday at lunch time. then spending the afternoon doing stuff, a lot of which will be at teh state library, and tehn the truth in the evening. it's going to be wierd going to see a show at teh arts theatre and not paying for it by volunteering for FOH. that's how i usually do it. cos im not paying to see shows, no way. no this time im using one of the several 2-4-1 vouchers i have. essentially someone else buys a ticket so i get a free one. first time ive used one on myself in a very long time.&nbsp;
ok tv calls

oh yes thats what i was going to say. i just bought a cordless phone to replace our old ex-telstra-callcenter- type phone. which works perfectly, i just felt like splurging. ah my mum and my fly-buys card. a brilliant team. only cost 7500 points too. bloody cheap phone.&nbsp;
but until that arrives, which could be up to 4 or 5 weeks, we are stuck with the old corded phone.

'<br />oh and we borrowed mums shaver thing and peg cut my hair!! 3 all over. is good. i like it a lot.<br />also very good news is that mum has i htink accepted peggy and our relationship. doesnt want us too lovey-dovey around people cos she has 'young children' who are much more accepting of it and always have been, and hte youngest of whom is 12. pfft.&nbsp;<br />my brother has a girlfriend. i find this hilariously funny and so cute.<br />and he's grown. they all have. it's really really scary how much they have all changed. and oliver has a motor bike. it's ginormous. but so is he. apparently he's about 110 kilos or summing now. and im what 55? i am incredibly jealous. not that i want to weigh that much but he's my younger bloody brother!! damn it. i blame it on my super fast metabolism. which i apparently got from dad, not mum like i thought.<br />you know what peg went and did? i had the third season of the l word on order. so she goes and says hey can you call me insstead when it comes in and then she gives it to me for christmas. well her and her mum anyway. damn it . i gave her a little knife which is apparently a filleting knife and also a chef's knife cos she is always complaining that we dont have enough sharp knives in the house. so she's happy. </p><p>lunch should be almost ready. peg showed mum a new way of seasoning roast chicken. it involves oil, herbs, whatever seasonings you want, basically, and a blender. not just stuffing everything inside the chicken, as mum has been doing for years. </p><p>this means i should go. hmm. merry christmas everyone.</p>"

called my grandma today cos it was her birthday yesterday. seriously am i the only one&nbsp;with a grandparent who wears hot pink and is still all girly in their late 60s?&nbsp;damn. apparently my calling her made her day. it always does. apparently.
which is why im&nbsp;not too concerned about coming out to her and my grandfather (they're dad's parents). they, and my mum's parents come to that, are all of the more conservative era. i have no idea&nbsp;how they would react if i were to tell them that this girl i live with, im actually dating her. um. for the last year. yes, im gay. no, i dont want&nbsp;a boyfriend.&nbsp;
something tells me they wouldnt react all that positively. but they love me too much to want to estrange me. so they would have to come to terms with it like my parents did, cos im not changing for them.&nbsp;

"event","&nbsp;it was 11 months on saturday. it was also a good performance. the goose's name was susan.&nbsp;
woke up at about 10 to 12 today.&nbsp;
yesterday was crazy. more later when i feel awake.
i need to get dressed so i can go with peg to her parents' house and pick up a lawnmower so she can do the yard. claire, you interested in weeding for us at all? i want to do it at some point, and i would help,&nbsp;but you wouldnt believe how much of it there is and peg doesnt seem to think its her job as the tenant of the house to make sure the garden is weeded. ive told her grass seeds arent expensive and its way to easy to get snakes in high, fast-growing weeds and for the sake of her dog she needs to look after the garden but anyway.&nbsp;
love yez all"

"event","&nbsp;i have been attacking my ling2000 essay once again. i think its actually workable but im not about to touch the stuff ive already written unless there's a fundamental problem with it. right now i just want to pass. i can deal with not getting on the dean's list.&nbsp;
i am now up to 2243 words, estimated count without references and my one actual quote (as i am including examples) 2100. out of 2500-3000. that's a very open sort of range.&nbsp;
also need abuot 1000 more words on 2035 essay. will do that this afternoon. they're both due tomorrow along with the greek exam that rick let us take home. i did some of it last night, it's almost finished now. most of a parsing question (something like 'identify and parse all the participial forms and infinitives in this passage. ive done 3. there are lots more to go. it is after all a 4 or so line passage), some multiple choice then it's done. the unseen translation was the killer (word in the dative, didnt say why. i ended up making it a possessive. the number 3 for some reason. ended up making it part of the prepositional phrase preceeding it. the rest was easy, except for 2 words that took me ages to find). after tomorrow i shall be free. except that i have work. and a show. and an audition the day after said show opens. i will not be telling sally. she can find out on her own. and noone tell her, k??"

i only blog when i have got something to say and most of the time...
most of the time..its not something good..


so this time..first year of college is almost done..
and still..i am not able to adjust to college life..
i feel so stupid studying in UP..
gawd they're all so smart..
i hate it..
i dont have any problems with the lesson i get it all..
its just that the studying and the requirements are killing me..
seriously killing me...
maybe not physically..
but my head and my emotions are getting bothered by them..
i always cant find enough time to do everything..
until now i cant find a way to study more..
i always say i should study more..do more..be more responsible..
but it never happens..
its so easy saying something.. its so hard trying to put it into action..
gawd..im dying in UP..
i feel so irresponsible..
am i a bad student?..
maybe..possibly..
i knew it..
i knew i was never meant for UP..
i dont feel like im having a hard time when its discussion and seatworks...
the test...those FREAKING UP tests..
they are the worst tests ever..
i am more stressed than ever..
especially beacause i am stressed out by my phone..
damn that phone..
i hate you i hate you i hate you..
you have added so much to my depression..
i dont feel at home in UP...not at all..
unlike lasalle zobel..
i miss highschool.."

well my life is getting complicated. everyday that passes by seems to make my life a little harder. right now if failing, being broke, not working, not getting enough sleep and still not being able to eat in school is great, then fine my life is great.

am i ok with it?
well, i am still sane. i guess i can handle it. as long as i see ches once and a while. im happy. >:D<


confused?
yeap, please dont call me smart or say that i can handle things in school....its just DIFFERENT in UP manila. my parents dont even expect me to get high grades. they just want me to pass....when did that happen? they always told me to get honors, not below 87 and stuff like that. haha! im losing hope in myself...but i shouldnt!! god! buhay..i got to learn how to stand up on my own. the only time im sure now a days is when im with ches or when i get to spend time for myself...just doing stuff i want to do..no studying.

are'nt i lucky?

i lost my phone today..
while going home...
kasi my mom and i commuted home from atc..
jeep and then tricycle..
and thats where i lost it..
when my mom and i got in the tricycle, i was already holding on to my pocket where my phone was, and even when the tricycle started to move. then my mom and i started to talk and i let go of my pocket already making sure that nothing would come out. when we got home my mom got out of the tricycle first then i scooted to go out. i was holding this little plastic bag of groceries that my mom let me hold. then she paid for the tricycle. i rang the door bell and opened the gate and we both went in.
we dressed up and then ate lunch...i can't remember the step by step details. anyway then i needed my phone cuz i was going to check if i had any messages...
when i went in my room i looked all over...it wasnt there, so i checked my parents room, the kitchen, the dining room and later on the whole house, and even in the bathroom. i realized it was missing, and kinda panicked searching the house all over again. then i really panicked and woke my mom up, knowing that she's really tired i understood that she couldnt get up. but when she was up already i was kinda throwing stuff around already with frustration, and she still seemed like she didnt get the reality that i cant find my phone. so i said, ""bakit ba parang ang relax mo dyan? i lost my phone mom."" so un...i called my phone, around 8 times in total for today. it was ringing but there was no ring in the house. which kinda concluded that my phone was not in the house. 
what more can i do? my mom told my dad and right now im just waiting for him to come home to see if he did anything or if he got it back or if its gone...forever. sob.

i love that phone. well i love that sim card. i wouldnt care if the phone didnt come back as long as the sim card does. my sim card holds a lot of memories...a lot of significant memories..
i was trying to sleep a while ago...and i couldnt..why? cuz i was thinking about my phone.
that phone didnt cost much, but if i would compare that cost to what my family is experiencing financially...it really is a  lot...

oh, another thing, my sister wanted to play ps, and when she plugged the ps the socket exploded...

to day must be my lucky day...

or it may be the bad karma, (remebers eri and my conversation about karma)

...

CONGRATS TO EVERYONE WHO PASSED ATENEO!!

back to me...i've noticed that my entries have increased in number. oh well.
anyway, people got their envelopes from ateneo today and the fact that i didn't take the ateneo exam..stinks. i don't get my dad, how can he say that the reason why i shouldn't take the ateneo exam is because of the tuition when the tuition in taft is way more expensive then in ateneo.. (i think) what i know is that in ateneo they go with semesters while taft it's trimester. isn't it right to say that the tuition in taft is more expensive since it is trimester? 
then my dad says that the transpo, baon, books, expenses everyday would pile up making it more expensive. wrong again, isn't it the same when i go to taft? and anyway, he did say that i would be living at my uncle's house if ever i got into UP (which i did not) then maybe i could live at my uncle's house to if i had taken the ateneo test and passed. right? wala lang. i just realized these today. what was he talking about??

oh wait, what am i doing? there's no point of getting into all this stress/fuss about something that can not be changed, oh yeah i remember my dad did this to me to. (remembers UP results..""dapat kasi nakinig ka sa akin eh....."") T____T"

"event","its old news and it seems late to write about this, but its what bothers me right now so i'll be writing about upcat now. as most of you know i didnt get in up, which really disappoints me and disappoints my whole family ... especially my dad.

there was this night i was using th computer when he told me to go to sleep and then he started to give me a sermon. he was saying that he was really disappointed that i didnt get into up. he asked me who passed in my group, so i said stpeh did. he then asked me what course and i said english studies, then he commented, buti pa daw si steph kumuha ng non-quota course wherein she has a greater chance of getting in. kasi naman daw di ako nag iisip at di daw ako nakikinig sa kanya na dapat nilagay ko sa form ko ung mga non-quota course that will be able to get me into UP easier. di naman niya sinabi pero i felt that he was putting the fault on me, parang naramdaman ko na kasalanan ko na di ako pumasok sa UP dahil di ako nakinig sa dad ko. ang tigas day kasi ng ulo ko parati na lang daw kung anong gusto ko ang sinusundan ko. tapos naiinis daw siya kasi nung nag test ako i was complaining that the test was hard and nung araw na un, nawala na ang tiwala niya sa akin na makakapasok ako sa UP ... wow.

also he was talking about nursing again. bakit daw pag kinakausap niya ako about nursing parati daw ako umiiyak at one point. pano naman kasi, parang wala akong lusot sa pag kuha ng nursing eh. sabi niya na we have all the good books for nursing already sayang naman daw. bakit daw kinahihiya ko ung pag nursing ng mom ko ... hindi naman eh! wala nga ako sinasabi eh. how can he say that i think like that, eh wala nga ako sinasabi. tapos nag co-complain siya na ang mahal mahal daw ng tuition sa lasalle. ""three terms un! 60 thousand per term at the most"" like i dont know that. i know that! then he goes, pag nag CPA daw ako mababayaran ko ba daw ung 720k na gagastosin para sa pag aaral ko sa lasalle? kung pag tapos ko daw makakahanap ba kaagad ako ng trabaho? bat di na lang daw nursing, its more practical, blah blah. tapos meron pa siyang sinasabi na meron daw siyang kilala na accountant sa office, he's like around 60 and he still lives with his parents and has no car and blah blah, ayaw daw niya ako maging ganon. parang naman magiging ganon ako, di ako mag papabaya na magiging ganon ako, no. grabe nakakainis siya. its not like im going to settle for something like that. sus. 

meron pa,ung tuition daw na they will be paying or my lola will be paying, they will be paying for somthing that they dont like. crap, pinapa guilty ba niya ako? sayang ba ung pera nila sa pag aaral ko?? tinatanong daw ng lola ko sa dad ko kung ano na daw nangyayari sa akin. he's getting pressured from my lola. walang kwenta talaga ung lola ko na un. aghk! naalala ko tuloy ung nasa party, shit, sobrang napahiya ako non eh.

haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay ... 
buhay ... ang sarap mamatay ngayon, unfortunately i cant, i dont want people who care about me feel bad. *hugs*

i had my birthday party today after the last finals in school. it started at 6 pm and well until now is still going on. i had lots of fun today. it was the best birthday party i ever had, except of course that there was one person missing and that was Lui. 

a lot of people came. starting with erika, asha, pish, dom, sandy, nadine(who is still here sleeping), iris, steph, steffi, csiy, gabby, jenny, katriz, bea mansueto, trish, chris, tano, clemence, mykell, ping, rich, polly, louie, alec and ches.<3 *am i missing someone? im sorry if i am*

there was a buffet waiting for everyone. they all ate and i ate when everyone else was already done, people were amazed that i was eating. lol well, yeah, if i think about it, i dont eat in school, so they would be pretty amazed. lol.

the people on table no.1 (sila dommeh) were all wondering when ches would come. hehe...then a little later when i was eating he arrived with alec. it was my first time to meet alec, and i could tell that both of them were nahihiya na.

so there we were, i introduced ches and alec to everyone then lead to them to the buffet table. they sat down at table no.3 (lol, tano's table) then i got my plate and sat with them.

after eating, we just talked for a while and then my dad came and brought up the beer. people started to drink and they played i never game. even alec joined in. so they got drunked...actually a lot of people got drunk, am not going to mention them. when i was sitting with ches, dom, sandy and shar. we were mingling then it started to drizzle..actually it was drizzling of and on the whole day..anyway, it drizzled and then it became a little stronger, i kept on asking people if they were ok with the weather. some of them went in like sila rich and rochie.

i noticed that ches' shirt was slightly wet already and so i told him then he took it of. dom, sandy, shar thought he was going to put it on me..to you know cover me from the rain i guess...but he didnt, and i knew he wasnt, but they want him to do it?? and so after what they said 10 million years, he put it on me. i kinda felt wierd. >_<

NEXT! we had games, the game was a relay with an egg and 4 members in a team. since no one wanted to play, i joined in, buti na lang tano, mykell and iris volunteered. volunteer nga ba mykell? hehe. anyway we won and we all got 200 bucks as a prize, thats individual ^^ the next game was the eggplant and calamansi thing.....aaaw...Lui mems.

then medyo, random things happened like, people going out cuz they were drunk and needed to walk. and blah. hehe

OMG!! un nga pala, ung blowing of the birtday cake. dad was really funny. nakibiro pa siya, sa mga friends ko. the best...ANYWAY! un blowing of the birthday cake...i had to blow it 4? times, grabe. then after nag speach ung lola ko....wala talaga siyang kwenta....kung narinig ng mga tao, may part don na mag nursing daw ako para ako daw ang magaalaga sa kanya. aghk! whatever...

anyway, i think this day was great! i had lots of fun and also this was a really memorable birthday party.

laughtrip talaga dad ko. kasi naman when ches had to go, nagpaalam siya sa dad ko no, then he was all like, ""ano na? anong gusto niyo gawin dto?"" he was telling his friends. then they were like...""ano ba ginawa ng biyenan(? spelling?) mo sa iyo?"" ""sino ba? sino ba?"" or ""ako na pare, ako na gagawa."" meron pa nga ""painumun niyo muna, bago umalis."" grabe talaga sila. mas laughtrip kung nakita niyo in person.

i had lots of fun. i hope that the guys who went had fun to! thanks for coming! kahit na may christmas party the next day and late na kayo nakauwi. >:D< to all. sobrang salamat sa inyo lahat.

---------
..lalalalalala..

when sila dom, pish, sandy, asha left na....
ches and i walked down the street, it was alec's idea.
we went to school.
sabi nila steph ang tagal daw namin nawawala. 
(talaga? parang ang bilis nga eh.)

"event","the so called long weekend... where, supposedly students are given time to rest, has not been helpful for me to acquire such rest. projects disturbed my weekend, and gave me stress the whole time. i would have been dead if not for my friends who helped me. the chaos of my weekend started when my good friend online, asked me how my UPCAT test went. as some of you know, that UPCAT test crushed me completely. it left an unforgettable mark, which changed the view i had for myself. i never thought...in my whole life, that there would be a time where i would be guessing a 300-400(?) item test to pass. that was my first time ever to guess so much questions.
(sunday: august 20)
    anyway, my friend asked me about UPCAT, and for some reason i experienced a breakdown...again. just when i thought i'd be okay to answer that question already, i get a breakdown. which in effect connected with the 4 big projects i had to do this weekend. i got paranoid and began to question everything, and soon i thought i couldn't do any of these projects.
    but then, mother dear was online and she helped me with the project. well...she was helping, but the help i was getting made me feel weaker and so..i dragged my self down. i saw myself crying over the things i haven't done and haven't tried to do. (which i do say is really stupid.)i needed a break, a break from thinking, break from thinking to much, and so i did. i left all my thoughts of the projects and started to chat and just to chat.
    ""we"" chatted for a long time, and as we chatted i became calm and relaxed. it's really weird how things like projects, grade and school related subjects get me down then all i need to get back up is a little chat with some of my best friends. during the chat i forgot all about the stupid upcat test and projects that are due tom and wednesday. i forgot everything..well i forgot them for a while, and actually that was all i needed.
>chat<
    i had a conference with rafael, ches and banz. then i talked with sandy, then had a different conf with rai and mike. most of the time though i was with raffie, ches and banz. we talked about the EB...ahaha..it was so much fun, then later banz had to leave. so raffie, ches and i talked about *ehem*. basta we talked about a lot of things, ghosts, evil spirits (cuz 3 o'clock na non) food, *ehem* and stuff. hehe...it was fun. then rai's status was so cute!!! right sandy?? ^_______^ it was so much fun talking to them talaga. i missed that, cuz before everyday kami nag chat. haha.. anyway around 4? or 5? ches went missing, meaning he wasn't replying anymore. so i thought maybe he fell asleep again, and well kanina when i asked him what happened, he said he did fall asleep...hehe...its not like that was the first time he fell asleep on the comp. hehe..^^ then later on, raffie went missing naman. it was so weird. it was a good thing rai was still online, i was suppose to go to sleep already cuz i had no one to talk to anymore, but them rai said, ""you can talk to me""...haha so we talked. i didn't know he was already awake for a day, then mike told me, and so i was like..what?? so rai went to sleep and mike told me to sleep too. so that i won't have eye bags daw. whatever. :P anyway un.
> back to reality<
    i started with the THE portfolio project and realized that i did better when i was really high/happy. i guess a mood of a person really effects what she's doing. especially if that person is me. i always knew that my mood did a lot. i was actually able to finish the portfolio, all i needed now was someone to print the thing for me.
    i chatted with my friends till early morning. which i believe was really helpful. it really cheered me up and i had a really good time. we bonded and just bummed around. it was fun.:)
    i was called a fave friend that morning.:)
(monday: aug 21)
    supposedly i had a practice for the filipino play to go to, but unfortunately the car broke down...again. so i wasn't able to go, since my mom did not want me to commute and she didn't want to escort me either. so i stayed home. i played PS until 5...yeah i think that was 5. it was fun, bumming around, being happy. hehe.. then i did my art project, i was able to finish it, but i couldn't print it. there was no one who could print it and i was so scared that maybe my dad won't be able to print it out. especially since my project was done in print master, i mean not every computer has that program. so just a while ago i was panicking again. then my dad got kinda pissed and told me to relax. then i shut up, thank god i shut up. i couldn't help it, everything didn't seem to go my way. but i guess not everything can go your way.
    blah...hehe...
    i made a note to myself. ^__^

i wanna absent tomorrow!! i dont want to do the rap thing, and the reason??
its cuz we dont have one yet. until now...i believe it's hopeless already. i mean we only have ..how many hours?...until tomorrow. which is the practical test day. if only we were able to make a rap. but the hell...i cant write anything. it just sucks! >_<
i dont know what i'll do. absent na lang. ayoko na talaga. haaaay!!!
music rap....what a prcatical test. a practical test of shit thats what it is. i believe im like this not because it is really a crappy test but because we wer'nt able to make a rap to perform. i blame myself, maybe i should have started to write one before pa....
we're so dead....im so dead. i wanna absent!!! puhlease! sana umulan ng malakas at masuspend. talaga.

you know what my mom said about the practical test??
she said that it was a stupid practical test and that to tell sir that we dont think rap is a kind of music. it's just a bunch of words put together.
guess what, i think she's right. even though there are some raps which are nice, i still believe that its just not music at all....

im so dead tomorrow...absent na ako...absent or clinic.

haaaay."

upcat test:

you can say it wasnt hard but no matter how easy it seemed, i still wasnt able to answer atleast half of it with certainty. it sucks...
why the hell did i study, if most of it wont come out anyway. it was just a waist of time.
geology....latitude...wintersolstice...shit...word problems...more word problems...me solving not having enought time for everything.
there wasnt a single test i finished in that damn upcat test. only science and most of it was guesses. i cant believe others didnt get irritated with that test. when i practically cried after it. that was the worst test of my life...EVER!
worst test EVER...EVER...most number of guesses in my whole entire life!

Thats life, which means...its normal..?
Now doesnt that suck. Don't you wish that something's wrong instead of knowing that, thats how its really suppose to be. Wont it feel better to know that you could do something to change it rather than accepting reality.
Reality where somethings are just unexplainable. Where science does not answer all. Where you cant have answers for everything.

...thats life...

one time at my grandma's house, my grandma was asking me what school iwanted and i couldnt answer because i didnt really know. my mom told her UP. but then i remember UP is mostly about medical blah. i dont want to take medicine...well i think i dont want to. then my lola suggested that i should take nursing to. i dont want to take nursing....=_= then they were talking about all that crap about courses and schools....i wish i knew what course topick. i wish i could be like others who already know what they want to be when they grow up. who already picked what course they'll take. this sucks.
cant i just stay in highschool forever? lol
cant think of anything else tuloy. all i think these days is ""what course should i take?"" the school is really no problem, i'll just take every test. the only problem is that i wouldnt know which school to pick cause i dont know what course i'd e taking.
so far i still dont know what to take...and i've been trying to take my mind of it. cause i havent been enjoying my summer break. all i could think of is the time when i'd have to take the entrance exams and still dont know what course to pick. scared of going to school and still not know what to do......sucks.
right now, i dont see anything good about my summer break. hope you guys are having a great time this summer.

LOL. ano ba yan..bibili lang ng load eh. -_-

~*~Result nr 11~*~<br>
<img
src=""http://live.quizilla.com/user_images/P/PainfulBliss/1117236222_Power_Transportation.JPG""><br><b>Your power is:</b> Transportation
<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> To simplify matters you
<br />can, all in all, transport your way to
<br />places. This helps you get to places faster
<br />and be more efficent. In combat that is also
<br />good since your enemy will not know where you
<br />are and you can get suprise attacks on
<br />him/her. For evil purposes you can break in
<br />to bancs etc and rob places. For good
<br />purposes you can save people kidnapped in
<br />places (if you know where they are) etc.<br>As a person you are always on the go and don't
<br />like not having anything to do. You see
<br />boredom as useless and try to avoid it.
<br />Therefor you have many friends that can keep
<br />you occupied. Other characteristics are that
<br />you're a nice and easy-going person, and
<br />maybe even popular. You are impulsive,
<br />energetic and just someone looking for a fun
<br />time and adventures. People can't be bored
<br />with you.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> You have a tendancy to
<br />not stick with people and can get enemies
<br />when you're not loyal. You can also back-talk
<br />people which will make you less liked.</p>

we had a longtset in filipino today.
which i kinda studied for, kinda only.
so when i got to school i crammed more stuff in my head right before we took the test.
then we hada seatwork in geom.
the seatwork was hard...it kinda destroyed my head. O_o
i got a wierd head ache after answering that thing.
we had mass after.
mariel was going emo..cuz it was the last mass that we would ever have for this year.
wow...
i never thought that the year would end so fast.
we went through a lot.
a lot...lot of stuff happened..
lot of stuff changed..
i'm gonna miss this year.
we had recess after the mass.
during recess i was trying to transfer my homework in physics as fast as i can on the 1 whole sheet of paper i finally got.
i never expect that there wouldnt be any paper at home..O_o
i didnt finish it during recess so i crammed it in during physics time itself.
grabe sumakit ulo ko ron.
sumabaw at sumaog..lol
bby the time we were checking i was done with physics and then i crammed in my algebra homework.
grabe mas sumabaw at sumabog.
...you'd never imagine how high and crazy i got.
sobrang bangag at sabog na di ako tumigil  sa pagtawa...lol
i looked really  crazy and stupid.
me and ping actually ecame sobrang sabog.
then miss vicky gave us seatworks and 3 new lessons..
so mas naging sabog pa...LOL
you wouldnt believe it...grabe sabog!!
tanong niyo pa si dom...:D

phew!!

then we went to tano's place.
i got there before sila iris and nan doon na sila ric, aleia, rochie, dani, ali, gimo, nani, cc then gabby, jan vit, clar.
they were ordering and collecting money for the pizza that time.
sayang di ko dala wallet ko eh. dapat kasi sinabi nila eh.
sayang!
anyway, dumating na ren sila tano, jan and francis and franco.
malas nga eh kasi wala pa sila iris, dom, bea and sandy.
di tuloy sila nakasabay sa surprise namin.
there were a lot of food and cake and fish and bbq and pancit and coke and vodka and rum...lol
i actually drank...sarap pala ng vodka...lol
anyway, we played ps, talked, and hanged out.

grabe ang ganda ng ahay ni tano.
the est ung ""garden"" nila.
grabe!! @_@
it was so cool.
haay...
i walked there nga pala.
ang lapit lang pala ng bahay nila sa akin. lol
ang saya nga eh. :D

ang saya kaya maglakad.

"event","its a wednesday today...
somehow the worst wednesday, but how could you say its the worst if you get cheered up right before the end of the day.


it was a fine day, until science/physics time came.
i started to think...
and you know when i think...
i lose myself in thought..
and then i became so depressed that i would die.
i'd die so that i wouldnt think anymore.
think of '....' anymore
think why i miss it so much..
think why im fussing over this..
think why i '.... ...'
why i find it so hard to forget..
why i cant just stop thinking and go back to my oh so happy self.
why it doesnt seem to have effect on him...
why we dont talk..
why he let me know......

2 periods of depression and lost in thought.
what would you be then?
i was down...almost cried..
tried not to.
i didnt want any of it anymore
i wanted to talk to my ""kuya""
one of the few people that when i talk to, i would smile
even though he just said hi.
one of the few that i miss so much..
one really long friendship which started only through pro.
that lasted until now.
(continue later...or not)

with all this depression...
i thought nothing could make this worse.
then it happened
miss isidro came in our class with the ranking.
im 70 in the whole batch.............
70...
....70....
i started to cry and couldnt stop it...
joe was there...it was so embarassing.
he tried to cheer me up..
i had to go to the bathroom and so i did.
(what was more embarassing is that petal said a loud in the bathroom, ""dont cry nicole."" like that would help..)
i cried and couldnt stop...it was so hard to stop.
i hated everything..
i walked around the school...
trying to think of other things..but then i couldnt.
so i went to the gazibo and sat down and...well dom tried to cheer me up.
i tried to cheer up...it does start with yourself, cheering up i mean.
but i couldnt and so i went to the bathroom again.
i tried to fix myself cuz i was a mess.........
when i got out..lui was waiting for me.
made me smile to see that he waited for me.
thanx..

so we walked to class and we were already late and so who cares i didnt.

computer time...

it was medyo sad pa, then in a while after reading dom's LJ and the sweet loving comments....and silly funny answers...i was up
i felt so much better.
i got high...thanx so much everybody who commented dom's LJ.
thanx...

AND SO:

im so high na ^^
nyahahaha
and to think i was so down kanina
so wierd..:P
oh well
thats how life is.
i think i love my kuya!!!
omg...im gona post this??

then ang galing ng E. ^^
tapos g was ok...i cant remember eh. :D
and then....uh d it was ok ren.

uhm, we had swimming next...
one thing is...these swimming events just made me feel really bad
cuz we were default cuz none of our girls were swimming pala....-_-
so grabe default
and then ms almeria said that ""nicole bad ka ha, di ka nag swim, ikaw ang nasa line up eh.""
POTA
i didnt know i was in the line up!!
they never told me anything.
you stupid people made me cry...damn it.
i cant swim eh!
i cant do anything about that.....

anyway, back to good mood and great fun!! ^^

it was so much fun. :P
then game na. :D
first match was against D, we won, ^^
then the second was against g...
which something happened after they won...swt
then the next was against E (chanpionships)
we lost to E, grabe ang galing nila....
it was a bad lost. so bad that i couldnt stop thinking that maybe if i had spoken up it would have ended better.
i should have done something......-_-


ANYWAY!
i had so much fun.

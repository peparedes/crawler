it was pretty funny. they told me i should ""provoke"" him..i didnt even have too!

it was great.

dont know if it will be on tv..maybe..he was acting crazy so there is a good chance that we might..but

the ""revealing"" time..they were like ""hey cort do you want to be on tv?"" and hes like ""what?""

and they go ""cuz youre on vh1's motormouth!!!!"" and rush the car... cort just sits there and is all ""what are you talking about"" to the dude...the most subtle reaction ever!

cort took a 6 foot dive off a fence onto concrete.. and i jump the fence too.. to help him? no. instead i found a shopping cart, picked it up and threw it on top of him.. then started kicking him..

i also jumped on the hood of friends car and put a huge dent in it. i felt really bad. still do. i havent felt this bad since i tattooed a friends forehead with a knife and a sharpie while he was passed out.

cort and i fought somewhere else too..in the street in front of pats house i think.at 6am.. we lost his key so we had to break in.. somebody saw us, called the cops, and they eventually came. but,we were passed out. 

cort awoke to the cops outside his window throwing rocks at him to wake up. he didnt know it was them so he yells ""leave me the fuck alone or ill fuck you in the ass!"", thinking that it was one of us. the cop turned to his buddies and says, ""hey, this guy just told me he was going to fuck me in the ass""

"event","in a conversation do you listen or just wait to talk?

       do you think chivalry is dead?

                           would you ever kill somebody (if you had to)?






       has everyone just gone completely fucking insane or is it just me?




                                                                        who wants to go skate tomarrow?

its supposed to be nice.







ok, its your turn to talk now. 


     thanks for listening."

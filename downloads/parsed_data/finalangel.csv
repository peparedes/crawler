They moved it up. He acts normal, you would never know he had cancer. He's still goofy as ever. Lol..well, I'm gonna go finish watching <u>Enough</u>. Then <u>Reign of Fire</u>. Muwahaha. Bye!"

"event","Yeah, this is public. Well, I think I might shut down my journals. No reason to keep them. I have a journal in real life(Actually, it's a notebook I never used for school, but yeah)and I wrote my stuff and feelings down into it. I just don't know if I should have an online journal. I don't like people reading my stuff. So, yeah. 

Anyways, I'm sorry, Andrew. I wish you the best of luck in school. (If I haven't unblocked you and stuff by then)."

<center>For all you dumbasses who don't know what the picture means, it means I love Jean. ...And that this journal is friends only. If you're a friend of mine that just got a LiveJournal, either IM me or post a comment here. Or, if you're someone looking for a friend, I'll be more than happy to talk to you. But you have to be open-minded, not a stuck-up bitch/bastard, or the most evil bitch in town. Feel free to contact me.</center>

"event","Well ladies and gents the big camping trip starts tomorrow!  My big squirtgun plan didnt turn out as well as i had hoped but I will survive.  I went to a pimpster VBS this week and it rocked up to the last minute.  Ummm I learned how to burn people eyes out with laser pointer radiation....  I learned an advanced level of how to peel glue off your hand...  I learned that the mafia will always take out the doctor first.  Be sure for a really long post sometime when i get back from my trip cuz I will have many gangster things to speak about.  um I have discovered a new person who roxes..  ""DUN DUN DUN DUNN DUNNNNN!"" so now we rule the funny and no one can stop us.  and now read the Bible verses :)        


    Love is patient and kind.  Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude.  Love does not demand its own way.  Love is not irritable; and it keeps no record of when it has been wronged.  -1 Corinthians 13: 4-5

    You are merciful, Lord!  You are kind, patient, and always loving. - psalm 145:8

See everyone next week!"

"event","Well look at the title.  As you can tell this one will be more boring than the past ones!  

     I went to work git my pay for ONE DAY last week.  Yippeeee.  I came home and danced around for no reason for awhile.  I have been very happy lately.  Its like a never ending high...  Its called JESUS!  :-D  You should try it sometime!

     Well its 10:20 right now.  I'm trying to decide what music I want right now.  Um but thats not the point.  The point is I am SO FREAKING HAPPY!  I think I've just been making alot of changes in my life.  I think this is the effect of sunday's service...  (See yesterday).  I just love God.  I dont care that none of my friends never talk to me anymore.  I don't care that I have no life!  I am just uber happy!  You have to try this.  Wooooooowwwwwwwwwwww.  Hmmm ((O.o))  << hehe

     I dunno what im doing at all!

     Ok I know this is kind of short but we're already to the grand finale of today!  We got us another bible verseee!  I was gonna try to share the sermon my pastor (pete) did but then I realized I'm not the preacher he is.  I wouldnt be able to do it.  So instead we have some bible verses on joy:

     For the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete. -Deuteronomy 16:15

     You have filled my heart with greater joy than when the harvest is abounding.  -Psalm 4:7
     
   I might add more in later.  Keep an eye open!"

     I recently saw I Robot.  That was really kewl.  I havent seen any of my ""friends"" in who knows how long.  I'm very lonely.  I have my books to keep me company!  And my rollerblades and my skateboard and my cat...  ungood.  O well.  

     Hey, if you care IM me and tell me I just wanna see how many people end up IMing me saying they care.  So if you care IM ME!  

     Church was good.  Our youth pastor did this thing that really opened me up to God.  I feel closer to him after that one.  Hes a great preacher. No one like him.  He shared a good way to avoid sin.  Or thats what I got out of it.  

     Anyway O joy its a BIBLE VERSE FOR THE DAY!

     A false witness will not go unpunished, he who lies will not go free.  
-Proverbs 19:5 and 9
    
     I wrote that verse down after noticing it came twice in the same chapter.  If it does that... It must be something God's tryin to drill into our heads.  So read it over.  Try this one on for size:  

Starting a fight is like breaching a dam.  So drop the matter before a dispute breaks out. 
-Proverbs 17:14
There ya go the key to a fight free life.

A friend loves at all times... 
-Proverbs 17:17A
Hmmmmmmm  I wonder how many people know that?

Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tounge. 
-Proverbs 17:28
In other words BE QUIET! :-P or Do not talk so much.  Maybe I should try that.

OK folks thats that!  Have a nice day!"

     Im doing this page because it got annoying having to update my subprofile everytime something in my life changed.  Not like anyone reads that either.  Abywayses  Today I went to Jess's birthday party which was awesome.  I think someone there is a little confused as to what they like sexually..  *ahem*  Um no I will not give you details except in involved a swimming pool and one stalker girl..  stalking a girl.. I think.  But I had cake and we sat around for along time.  (yes this was fun).  I get to sleep in tomorrow (YESSSSS!)  Then I am sleeping over at friendses house fore weekend.  Dernerer.  So I may not get to posting anything tomorrow but its possible.  Anyway heres a quotes/ scriptures/ devotional thingy for the day:


I just finished reading the book, ""The Oath"" By frank perretti.  Frank Perretti= GENIUS!  He's a great writer and I could recommend this book to anyone.  It uses amazing symbolism to show how sin affects us if we leave it in our lives.  Great book it is unbeatable.  But be sure your ready to read 530 pages :) .  Every page is worth it.  But the main moral is - Sin will destroy you.  Do not let sin rule your life.  Now go read it.  

Quote of the day- ""If life's a rythm, I've found the perfect beat."" - a song by someone"

walk a lonely road,
the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
but it's on the mid, I walk alone

I walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
When the city sleeps
and I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk up

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shalow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Aha aha aha aha
aha aha aha

I'm walking down the line
that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline 
of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
what's noft up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
I know I'm still alive and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone and I walk up

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shalow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone 

Aha aha aha aha
aha aha I walk alone and I walk up

I walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
when the city sleeps
and I'm the only one
and I walk up

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shalow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone"

"event","YOU'RE THE TOP   from Anything Goes

 


At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 

That I always have found it best, 

Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 

To let 'em rest unexpressed, 

I hate parading my serenading 

As I'll probably miss a bar, 

But if this ditty is not so pretty 

At  least it'll tell you 

How great you are. 

 

You're the top! 

You're the Colosseum. 

You're the top! 

You're the Louvre Museum. 

You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 

You're a Bendel bonnet, 

A Shakespeare's sonnet, 

You're Mickey Mouse. 

You're the Nile, 

You're the Tower of Pisa, 

You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 

I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

 


Your words poetic are not pathetic. 

On the other hand, babe, you shine, 

And I can feel after every line 

A thrill divine 

Down my spine. 

Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 

Might think that your song is bad, 

But I got a notion 

I'll second the motion 

And this is what I'm going to add; 

 


 


You're the top! 

You're an arrow collar 

You're the top! 

You're a Coolidge dollar, 

You're the nimble tread 

Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 

You're an O'Neill drama, 

 



You're Whistler's mama, 

 



You're camembert. 

 


You're a rose, 

You're Inferno's Dante, 

 


You're the nose 

On the great Durante. 

I'm just in a way, 

As the French would say, ""de trop"". 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 

You're the top! 



 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 

You're the top!"

I decided not to egg their car when I had the egg in my hand and was standing in front of their car. Now THAT'S what I call a nice deed!"

"event","Oh I just had a relapse of my horrifically magnificent dream! It was me and someone else (I think Krystina), my work partner, in Wollongong near the train station, trying to sneak into the building above Kwik Kopy, to a secret organisation. To uncover the conspiracy, we attempted to get in, but were warned by Keanu Reeves who was hiding across the road at the Navy building, that they had great security and that it would be very dangerous. 

So we didn't go in, but my partner had to fly overseas for an emergency meeting but warned me to stay safe and not try anything stupid. Being the brilliant persuader that I am, I convinced Laura to join me for another shot, enriching her with thoughts of fortune, if we made it in the forbidden building. 

Well we managed to get in, and Laura had no idea of the immense danger she was in, smiling broadly. The foyer was packed with Asian people, semi-corporate busy-bodies. I was calm, she was hysterical.

Well anyway, Keanu was there again! Sitting next to us, looking rather shabby in black, and suspicious, then very sternly he said, 'What are you doing here? I thought I told you it was dangerous?' I smiled casually and said, 'Nobody's here to stop me'. 

The security sighted us, and we made a run for it. Outside seemed to have darkened a lot, we must have lost track of time, I hid under the stairs and told Laura to do the same, but she ran my god so fast! down south. Thunder and powerful rainfall began to enthral the atmosphere. I called out to her to stay with me, then I saw Keanu across hiding at the Navy place again -wimp. He said, 'You're safer with her'. So I ran after her, then huge marching robots stomped through the rain towards us, while I stood in bewilderment, gobsmacked at their size, Laura made a quick turn around heading north -running so fast she was a blur in all the wet! So it was no use, I would never catch up to her.

But the last thing that happened was crazy! When the army of robots zapped Laura with their radar-gun looking thing, she didn't deteriorate or disapparate no, she shattered into smithereens! Like Homer and the Sun in the Chili Cook-Off...

Then I woke up. But I predict if my dream had continued, the robot monsters would have offered me a place in their league, as I showed a very gallant characteristic which would be an asset to their team :D

The moral of this story is to <b>never trust anything Keanu Reeves says, and Robots can live under water.</b>"

"event","MY PREDICTION WAS RIGHT! .... TOOL <i>is</i> going to play at Big Day Out! I knew they would, they love Australia and they didn't announce a second show after their first one sold out in 3 hours. So YAY! This is so exciting! Muse are there too, but I'm going to their side show as well ^_^. Isn't it lovely? We got to see their growing stages in stardom, like Chris Wolstenholme mature from his daggy hair-do, and Matt Bellamy hit puberty with all the sweating in the clip for Supermassive Black Hole lol, and now they're coming back!

I predict also The Butterfly Effect will probably come, and Basement Jaxx, AND OH-OH-OH.. EMBRACE::::: <B>THE MARS VOLTA</B>.. just remember people <b>no slam dancing in front of Cedric</b>.. or..ugh hold on *looks for link* - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFME1Huz108 yeah freaky huh? Too much drugs I say :S ...well I'm going to their side show too, they're like the modern-day rebellious Pink Floyd, more fast-paced, and frightening .. and nooo not because they have grizzly manes haha.

That is all. (Yes I have adopted some of Miranda Priestly from Devil Wears Prada's rude nature.. *drops face into hands and begins to tear up, attempts to run to room, misses and runs into wall, falls to the ground unconscious and unseen*"

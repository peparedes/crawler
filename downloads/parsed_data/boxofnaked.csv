<li>Before you go to bed every night, think of three good things that happened that day and analyze why they occurred. It makes you focus more on good things that happen, which might otherwise be forgotten because of daily disappointments.<li>Work on savoring the pleasing things in your life like a warm shower or a good breakfast.<li>Write down what you want to be remembered for, to help you bring your daily activities in line with what's really important to you.<li>Regularly practice random acts of kindness, things like holding a door open for a stranger or doing a roommate's dishes, for 10 weeks. The idea is to improve a person's self-image and promote good interactions with other people. (Participants who performed a variety of acts, rather than repeating the same ones, showed an increase in happiness even a month after the experiment was concluded. Those who kept on doing the acts on their own did better than those who didn't.)<li>Think about the happiest day in your life over and over again, without analyzing it, and write about how you'll be 10 years from now, assuming everything goes just right.

<i>""When it was over, all I could think about was how this entire notion of oneself, what we are, is just this logical structure, a place to momentarily house all the abstractions. It was a time to become conscious, to give form and coherence to the mystery, and I had been a part of that. It was a gift. Life was raging all around me and every moment was magical. I loved all the people, dealing with all the contradictory impulses - that's what I loved the most, connecting with the people. Looking back, that's all that really mattered.""

"event","My goal to stay up for my 8AM class and fall asleep on the 5-hour bus afterwards is failing. I already feel myself crashing. I've tried to keep myself entertained thus far, and it has worked, but I am at a loss as I feel more of a desire to sleep than stay up. I hate this decision, because it brings on a higher potential of sleeping through my one-and-only class tomorrow morning. And attendance matters whether you believe me or not. And it's an easy class. And I can't miss it if I sleep in, because that would also imply/assume I miss the bus that takes me to the far away lands of the North.

The day-day was long. (Tuesdays and Thursdays always are.) 10 pages of a Macro assignment, and I'm not entirely sure that it's 100% correct. School used to be easy, damnit. There is no reason I'm taking this class. That certainly doesn't help my motivation to learn more.

Frax came over tonight (because he's here for the weekend!) around 10:something PM. A 3-minute dance party was had. (That's right. I have photographic evidence.) Well, it was just Frax ""dancing,"" and I don't remember how it came about -- although I am sure he will remind me once I write that -- but it happened and that is the end. :P Good times were had. I miss having in-person conversations with him. And Shan, too. She was there, being my roommate and all. :) Frax eventually left around 2:something, and I was originally going to go to bed.... but... when I passed The Man Room on my way to go the bathroom and get ready, I heard The Men talking so I joined them for about a half hour more. Although drunk, Jordan is wise. And Kevo farts, but he still cares. And Sam, is Sam. I don't know. But he cares, too. They are all very good boys. (Sorry. Men.) Upon my exiting of The Man Room, Shan came to tell me about recent drunk-drama that was occuring nearly 2 inches away from our dorm room. Naturally, we ended up spying on them through our peep hole until about 3:30 in the morning when the noises subsided. I have concluded that I very much enjoy spying on people through our peep hole. My entire body was pressed up against the door. I'm surprised they didn't feel my eyes watching them -- or Shan krinkling the bag of Trix, whichever.

Contemplate your relationships with people and the Temporary Student Advantage card sitting to your right. Contemplate one particular picture that seems more pixelated than the rest and remember the smiles on their faces. Remember the happiness and the freedom and the lack of stress and when things came easy to you... remember when you didn't have to <em>try</em> in order to get good grades.

Contemplate the calendar that continues to fall from the door and wonder where the thumb tack went. Contemplate why you sometimes whisper or mouth things to yourself when you're typing alone, as if to concentrate harder and understand more of what's showing up on the screen in front of you. Contemplate how much money you've wasted in the last year while knowing how much you could have saved instead.

Know that you will care at the last minute, because suddenly grades mean everything to you, and you don't want to fail <s>other people's</s> your own expectations. Think about the happier things in life. Think about why you want to get your second tattoo, why you want to see this person, why you want to spend this money, why you want to get these grades, why you want to accomplish these things, why you want to become this person - think about your life into the future, when none of this will matter, yet you'll continue to look at the fuzz of your little black gloves and wonder how they ever mattered in the first place.</lj-cut><br><Br>

"event","Oh my god. My weekend has officially ended.

This is the first time I have sat in my room alone contemplating what to do with the rest of the day until work.

<lj-cut>So, firstly, my little sister (who's actually 16, so I don't know why I continue to call her ""little,"") Meaghan stayed with me and Shannon from Friday until.. a few minutes ago (Monday). My mom and dad left town for a wedding in Iowa of people Meaghan didn't know -- and obviously hanging out with one's older sister and her friends is a lot better than a road trip with one's parents. On top of Meaghan hanging out in the dorms, this was also the weekend of the ""Hamline Experience"" where various students on campus host perspectives and make them want to come to Hamline next year. Pretty sure me and Shan rocked at that - our kid (Amanda) loved us, and she was super cool too. Shan was very excited because not only did Amanda like the color pink, but she liked NASCAR. And Shan is a huge NASCAR fan; moments earlier she was shouting for Jimmie Johnson to win the Daytona and the entire floor knew about it. (She was explaining the ways of NASCAR to me and Meaghan as we watched the beginning and end of it, as well.)

Meaghan also took random adventures with me before Amanda got here.... we took the bus to Alice's party on the day of all days for it to be cold enough to freeze one's nostrils.. but it was nice to see Alice, Chris, Ruby, etc again so it ended up being worth it. (We would have frozen to death if Alice didn't give us any additional ""duds"" for the ride back.) The morning after that we walked to Perkins.. our waiter gave us free orange juice.. :-P I introduced Meaghan to the ""ways of Hamline"" (in particular, the group, and especially Kevo because a world without Kevo is no world at all).

In addition to that aspect of Hamline, however, she also saw people coming back wasted out of their minds when we got home from Alice's party. I could tell she felt uncomfortable, so I told her to stick around my dorm room while I ended up taking care of Kevo, Sam, and KG for the majority of the night. I walked KG to the bathroom and held her hair back as she was puking, I made sure everyone knew where their designated trash bin was, and I made all of them drink water in order to get the ""poison"" out of their blood (that's what Kevo kept calling it; he also kept telling me that his liver was ""fighting like a man,"" and we should call him Chuck Norris..) *sigh* They drank way too much. But I must say, I never thought I would be so helpful in such a situation. When it happens to you, you're incredibly thankful for all of the people that took care of you, and you can't believe that they were willing to do stuff like clean up your puke or stop you from passing out on the toilet..... it's only when you do this for someone else that you understand how it all works. You understand why it's okay to be there for them no matter what rather than get grossed out and leave. I finally understand how moms deal with the disgusting stuff their children do - Shan calls it our natural maternal instinct, where suddenly taking care of your friends is the only thing that makes sense. I was in The Man Room for a considerbly long period of time, making sure everyone was okay until they finally went to sleep with nothing left to puke up.... it felt wonderful. It reminded me of what they said when they helped me and Shannon a few months ago: <i>you'd do it for us</i>. And it's true. I just never believed one's willingness to help would accumulate to such an extent.</lj-cut>

Needless to say, it was a pretty crazy weekend. Full of plenty of food and coffee (and caramel white hot chocolates for Meaghan :-P) and Comedy Sportz - and Kevo being one of the volunteers!! - but I had fun. It's going to be hard stepping into the reality of school tomorrow (even though I had a class today, but that hardly counts), with three relatively difficult classes to attend and homework to complete before then as well as work tonight....... but I'll do it, because that's just what I do. And it'll be a chaotic week, but oh well, this weekend was worth it. (I wrote that so I could remind myself later, when I'm freaking out with too much to do and very little time to do it in.)

I'm going to go find something to entertain myself with. It's not likely going to be homework, so I'm clearly already making smart choices for this week, but at least I'm acknowledging my bad decisions now rather than wondering what the hell happened by Thursday."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Today, and Brian. Only read if you're ready.""><small>""I Will Remember You"" by Sarah McLachlan has been in my head since Brian's visitation. I guess what made it worse is that immediately afterwards (still in dressy clothing, implying people ask why) I had to go to work. Things were pretty mellow for awhile - I didn't have to call (instead I filed with Kyla, which wasn't too bad... it distracted my thoughts most of the time). But right before hand, when everyone was gathering their things to start working, Kyla was showing me this Handbook for Singles (that's not actually the title) that she bought on Valentine's Day which had a lot of amusing Do's and Don'ts in terms of [obsessively] seeking relationships... and then suddenly that same song I kept hearing at the visitation started playing in the background. The song that played while images of Brian's childhood flashed on the screen as everyone watched with tears in their eyes. I couldn't help but start crying again. I feel like it's still one of those things you only remember once you start thinking about, and then you just can't stop. I'm glad I went. I wanted to see him. I wanted proof that it happened, so I could step out of this overwhelming sense of denial..... but he didn't look like himself. I guess that's to be expected, when there's so much make-up on his [expressionless] face... but he didn't smile like he used to; he was an entirely different person laid to rest in the casket. I tried so hard the entire time to hold myself back from sobbing. Greta kept talking about Chemistry with him (I was also in her class, with Brian). Mrs. Anderson would always get annoyed with him for bringing random things up to distract the class, but it was never an anger-annoyed... it was always a friendly, ""Oh, Brian.."" sort of reaction, and the entire class loved him for it. History Day was an entirely different environment with him, a different group of people, a different teacher, but nonetheless he was the Brian that I remember. I guess I sometimes still have a hard time believing that he's gone, even with the program clutched tightly in by hands and the memories and pictures and his body right before my eyes. When I was filing, Kyla left to go to the bathroom, and I was in the room by myself, left to my thoughts... Faith Hill's ""Breathe"" came on the radio, and suddenly I was reminded of what I always notice and examine at open-casket wakes and funerals.... they're not breathing anymore. So of course I started crying again.. I couldn't help it. I composed myself before she came back and continued filing, but it's just so hard sometimes, when it remains something that you can't believe is really happening. This really happened. I keep thinking this isn't something you should have to do. You shouldn't bury your friends and peers - not when they're this young. It was so sad to see people go up to the casket and start breaking down... you could just feel so much sadness aluminating all around them. Even if you didn't know them, even if they were only someone you recognized, you wanted to go up and hug them and tell them everything was going to be okay (""because that's just what you say""). Instead I watched more and more people cry and hug one another... it was relieving to see that most people had someone to hold onto. I'm so glad I had Maura and Greta, even if we all knew him in different ways.. Maura especially, having gone to school with him for 12 years...... [Maura, I love you, thank you so much for going with me.] I want this to be it. I want everyone else to live the long successful lives that they hope and dream for. I never want someone close to me to die. Of course that's what this leads me to: fear of the people closest to me dieing. Someone dies, you're reminded of the fragility of life, and suddenly you start praying to whoever you pray to that it won't happen again - that it won't happen to the people closest to you. And you're overwhelmed with this feeling to let everyone know that you love them. <b>I love you.</b> I love you, I love you, I love you....

<br><br><Br><br><br><Br><br><br><br>*sigh* It's a lot harder to clear your thoughts of such things and start fresh. I want to write something non-Brian related; something to distract me. I need something to distract me. <lj-cut text=""Random Thoughts.""><b>Random Thoughts.</b> Hi. How are you today? I got dressed up and had to tell people why. They asked more questions than I was expecting - are you supposed to say thank you when people say, ""Oh, that's tragic.. I'm so sorry."" I had hot cocoa and a muffin for supper. Comfort food. Don't yell at me for not eating, this isn't the time. Comfort food. The cocoa didn't taste that great. I have yet to finish the muffin. Filing was good. Filing distracted me. I'm sure I would have upset the poor people I had to call today anyway. I'm just not up to par. I'm trying, but I'm trying too hard, and sometimes it feels too fake to keep going. I can smile. I can laugh. I can also cry. I've done all three today. <b>Random thoughts.</b> Next subject. I purchased a ""Student Advantage"" card today. Mostly so I could get 15% off of Greyhound, if the St. Paul bus depot doesn't give me the same deal that the U does. Money makes the world go 'round. They didn't capitalize the first letter of the second part of my last name. That was confusing. The G. They didn't capitalize the G. Never hyphenate your poor childrens' names. I understand that you want to be an equal to your husband, so you keep your maiden name, but why hyphenate your childrens' names? <b>Random Thoughts.</b> There is a dark blue suitcase and a 13 page syllabus to my left. I had to make sure I spelled syllabus right. Pictures decorate my cubby. His program rests next to a Valentine's Day card that Hannah made me. Oh, Hannah. Miles got me a silly Valentine's Day card that says ""Sit On My Face... and I'll eat my way to your heart."" Haha. Miles is silly. I like him. My friends at Hamline liked him, too, when he visited last weekend. That was fun. He got me ""The Princess and the Warrior."" (!) I love that movie. Many points to him. Many many. :D Maura, Miles and I went to The Black Sea - a nearby Turkish restaurant - to eat. It was pretty good. Crowded and small, but nice in one of those hole-in-the-wall random places you see. If you ask me what makes Turkish food Turkish I couldn't tell you. <b>Thoughts.</b> Jesse gave me [and Shan, and several other girls I'm sure] a rose. It almost died, but I saved it. Shan and my roses now rest in a large Dasani water bottle on top of our microfridge. They're beautiful. Bailey gave Shannon pink roses for Valentine's Day, along with a giant Hershey's kiss filled with mini kisses. She came back with the biggest smile on her face. Her immediate response was, ""They're pink!!"" She loves the color pink. I took a picture and made it focal black-and-white (focusing on the pink roses, of course, the only object of color in the image). <b>Beat.</b> Shannon just came into the room and said to me in a matter-of-fact/nearly monotone voice, ""My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard."" I smiled. It reminded me of Miles, which made me smile even more - not only because he's Miles, but because it's funny that the song reminds me of him. :) Just like cheese. Cheese reminds me of him. And random songs that I remember Mike playing in his Van Of Death. <b>Random Thoughts.</b> I've talked to Ben a few times. I found a videotape that we made back in the day. I saw myself. Shannon said she could tell it was me (when you hear me in the background), but we both noticed that I talk differently. My laugh is similar, but my voice [and articulation, especially] is completely different. There was one scene where Ben was taping me drinking milk. I made a lovely [incredibly unattractive] burp and was dressed in all black. My hair was short and dark. Robby's right. I do look better in my normal-colored long hair. I feel so much more attractive, now. I was so annoyed when I watched the tape. I sat there in disgust with myself. Shannon watched a lot with me. I was disgusted with myself, and Ben and my relationship, wondering why we didn't break up sooner. I didn't pay attention to him. We didn't have great conversations. Maybe these are the things that were just displayed on the screen, as both of us felt incredibly awkward being filmed, but it was just unpleasant to watch none the less. I did see his kitties, though. Stinky and Fatty: probably the fattest cats I have ever seen in my entire life. I wonder if they're still alive. I hope so. Ben had a lot of footage of them on the tape. Shannon couldn't believe they could even walk. (They don't walk, they waddle.) God, it was weird. I was a weird kid. I find nothing attractive about the person I saw on that tape. I remember at the very end scene, I said something that I recall making note of to my future self. Right before I turned off the tape, I told Ben that I loved him... he said it back, but you couldn't really feel it in either of our voices. You couldn't feel it the way I feel it with Miles. That made me incredibly happy, knowing I never felt the same way about Ben that I do about Miles. But I remember making a note to say it before I turned it off, as if I was trying to convince the self watching it in the future that that's how it was. (The original idea behind making the tape was so I'd have something to watch when I missed him. I think I watched it once.) <b>Beat.</b> I think I'm done with random thoughts, for now. The boys are being loud. They have an ethernet cord running from Sam's Man Room to Nick & Eric's room in order to play... some game... probably Star Wars or Halo... I don't know. But they're being loud. And I have homework. And I don't know when I'll go to bed. Let me know if you read this far. I really did put my heart into it, despite how random the thoughts were. They were real. I didn't delete anything, nor did I think too much before completing the sentence. Speak your thoughts - comments make me feel <s>like people are paying attention</s> loved.</small></lj-cut>"

"event","Well. I have officially attended all of the classes I'm taking, as of this morning.

<u>MWF</u>
<li><b>Intro to Music; 8-9AM</b>
Yesterday we learned about time signatures, tempos, how to read music, etc. [...] Oh my good god. I hope after we've covered the basics behind ""Musical Elements"" I'll actually learn something.

<u>TTh</u>
<li><b>Macroeconomic Analysis; 8-9:30AM</b>
Today was my first day. I think with the help of smart computers and Excel Spreadsheet, it should be relatively easy to understand. We did our entire homework assignment (due in one week) in class. All I have left to do is write a paragraph (""one line... maybe four.."") of the data in the table. Very cool.
<li><b>Intro to Environmental Studies; 9:40-11:10AM</b>
Class was canceled today, but last time we discussed various ""Environmental Issues"" that we wanted to cover (basic stuff like pollution, global warming, etc). I guess it should be pretty interesting. It's very basic in comparison to special topic classes like Global Feminisms that I took with Prof. Forte last semester, but her teaching style seems similar. (<i>My Environmental Studies teacher actually reminds me a lot of Prof. Forte.. I really miss her. I keep seeing people from class and from the memorial service -- everytime I have to walk in the same building I can't stop thinking about it.)</i>
<li><b>Intro to Anthropology; 12:50-2:20PM</b>
It seems like this class will be [in Mr. Bergland's words,] ""challenging, but fair."" The professor is a short round man with a big grey beard, and he wants us to call him Skip. (Hmm.) He tends to talk a lot and I tend to zone out when that happens, but I'm going to try my best and pay attention. Shannon's in that class with me so it will be nice to have a roommie. :-)

I should actually go read for Anthro before lunch, but I thought I'd leave you with a <i>lovely</i> sign that I saw today:
<lj-cut text=""Note the location of the staple..""><img src=""http://www.yesalbum.com/v001/emilyhg/misc/superbowl_019_res.jpg"">

<font color=red><b>Edit</font> [11AM]</b> That reminds me, I've been talking with some people (mostly from various conversations at work, last night) about changing my interest/major from something <i>psychology</i> related to something <i>sex education</i>/psychology related. I feel like this is an obvious choice for me; suddenly I'm much more excited to grow up and learn everything I need to know to become the next Sue Johanson. (I'm sure my parents would <i>love</i> telling people that their daughter studies <i>sex</i> for a living... :-D)

<font color=red><b>Edit</font> [3PM]</b> (In relation to the above edit-topic) I saw something in our school paper today that caught my attention: ""<b>We're hiring for the spring 2006 sex columnist.</b>"" I'm thinking about applying, but I don't know how I'd do. I love talking with people about several issues revolving around sex, but can I answer people's questions that I won't always be able to relate to? I feel like I'm able to relate to questions my friends ask me.. but can I sit there and write a 500-word response to strangers' questions? I think part of my hesitation is based on how little I am educated in the field to be able to devise more of the ""biologically, this is why <i>this</i> happens"" response rather than things that are experience/logic/opinion based."

Pablo, our new CA, took this picture of me yesterday and put it on our floor board. I get a smiley face and everything, man.

I feel like this picture really represents how I spend my free time. Sure, I do other things, but how else do I stay up for two consecutive nights until 5:something in the morning?</lj-cut>

As for an update, Frax came and saw a Hamline gymnastics meet (vs. Stout) with myself and others last night; watching a gymnastics meet is a lot more confusing and random than anticipated, but still cool. He also introduced me to the wonders of Eurotrip and grapefruit that I decided to eat like an orange. :-) Good times.

Ashley and I went to a Roller Derby tonight at Roy Wilkins. (I've never been to a Roller Derby before, nor did I have any idea what it was before tonight.) We took a shuttle with a bunch of adults (not exactly the company either of us were expecting) to the event... turns out it's quite the popular sport? :-P It was fun - lots of bruises maintained by the participants, but both teams we cheered for (Dagger Dolls & Garda Belts) ended up winning. Check out the Minnesota RollerGirls at www.mnrollergirls.com if you wanna see some nice bruises. :-) We also went to Cafe Latte and had several delicious food items followed by milk and Scattergories in my dorm room. Overall, it's been a pretty good weekend other than the fact that I woke up around 3:30PM today and felt like the laziest Lazy of all laziness."

"event","Once upon a time, Emily got back from her one-and-only-class of the day around 9 or 9:30AM and decided to do 100 sit-ups. And then she decided to do 100 sit-ups, bicycle-style. And then she decided to do 100 [*cough*girl-style*cough*] push-ups.

.....

I'm not sure how one just randomly decides to do such things, but apparently it happens. Perhaps I'll make it a trend. My spine kind of hurts, due to the FLOOR OF MY DORM ROOM but it was worth not walking in the crappy-wannabe-snow to the gym.

<b>I.</b> The Garden State & Wicker Park soundtracks are probably two of the best soundtracks ever. I'd almost say Garden State's soundtrack is better than the movie. ...And I officially want to own Wicker Park. Ah.

<b>II.</b> Today was quite eventful for the amount of time I had the possibility of wasting:
<lj-cut text=""It's a LIST!"">-was in bed by 10:something PM; I slept off and on but I've realized by body isn't used to going to bed before 7AM, apparently.. that needs to change
-was bored of continually waking up at weird hours, so I eventually got up before my alarm went off around 5:45AM
-lazed around, took a shower, BLOW DRIED MY HAIR (this is a big deal, guys), got dressed, felt pretty, went to breakfast club @ 7
-actually ATE breakfast (also a big deal); I've found that when you're awake for a significant amount of time before breakfast, you tend to be hungry for it
-had plenty of time to casually walk to my one and only class of the day, was waitlisted for it, got accepted, signed add slip, woo.
-got out of said class (Intro to Music) 20 minutes after it started
-walked to dropped-class-prof's office, signed drop slip, another woo
-set up adhesive dealies for LIGHTS in Shan and my dorm room
-went to lunch club, ate again, ..good for me
-got BOOKS (only $121.something -- awesome)
-set up LIGHTS with Shan#2; this has been a plan since Christmas and it's DONE; woo#3; need more lights to complete the square
-strung 6' silver beady garland thingy on random pole (telephone cord cover on the wall near the door, not that you care)
-felt accomplished; watched ""When A Stranger Calls"" trailer online; facebook; here.</lj-cut>

TADA.

And now, I feel like sleeping. 
I have work in an hour and a half.
Hmm.

Private entry for now because it's so freaking random? Okay.

<b><i><big>4:22pm</b></i></big>
<B>III.</b> Oh my goodness. So, Chris and Randi celebrated their one-year anniversary recently. ..Ah, I'm being girly I'll just copy/paste it.

<lj-cut text=""Mr. Romantic"">Chris: it was a fancy, candlelit dinner in my room, and I had it all set up and the candles lit and I held my hand over her eyes till we were in the room and then let her see it
me: awwwwwww
me: that's so cute, chris
Chris: with the dozen roses in the center of the table
Chris: all candlelit
Chris: it was perfect
Chris: the awesomest awesomeness in like-ever
Chris: :P
me: wow.
me: oh my god.
me: Shan and I want that.
me: so when did you give her the ring?
Chris: well, we ate dinner, then we had desert, and after I cleaned that off the table, she said she had something for me, so she gave me the corpse bride, which came out yesterday, and I was like OMG!, and then I gave her the ring
Chris: I was like, well, since we're exchanging gifts...heres yours :-)
Chris: she was like OMG!...you could tell she was totally speechless
me: awwwwwwwww
me: that is so adorable
me: yay!!!
me: and she didn't hit you????
Chris: nope :-D
me: :-D:-D:-D
me: yay!!
me: oh chris I'm so happy
me: that's awesome
Chris: I also gave you credit for the dinner thing, but I also explained how I dont really think its your idea, but it might be slightly
me: haha
me: aw
me: awww, now Shan and I are being girly
me: and how we want to be surprised like that rather than go with the person and get it
Chris: lol
me: *sighs*
...
me: I think it's very very sweet (& I know Shan agrees), what you did for Randi. More guys need to realize that it's still very okay to do sweet things like that</lj-cut>

THE END. (Major kudos to Chris. *applauds*)

<b>IV.</b> It's amazing what existing throughout normal day-time does to you. I'd say I'm happier and perkier and overall much better than usual - I <i>am</i> pretty, and greeting random people with smiles, but I feel the possibility of crashing after being up since 5:45AM coming rather shortly....

Hyper/crashing Emily = random entries = not always being able to make sense in a well-thought-out structured-sentence sort of way. Oh well. Wheeeee."

<b>UPDATE [5:04AM]</b> - I couldn't help myself.. I kept creating more versions of the same people. I found Ange a Hawaiian shirt, I made Miles relatively normal looking (and also found a different knight-like gettup), I made Nick a pirate because I couldn't believe I didn't the first time, I made Ruth batman because she keeps making love to him (her hair got darker in the process), and I decided that Ashley didn't need to look so formal for her job at the capital. (KG warned me that this would get addicting...) I apologize to those of you without eyebrows.

I spent all day with Jen and Mollie, today - old friends from North St. Paul. It was nice to see them again - they even drove all the way here just to pick me up and drive back to the new Caribou in Maplewood. Crazies. We spent a few hours in Caribou, I met their friend what's-his-face, was caught up on various happenings while I updated them on my life as well. It's always nice to catch up with people you haven't talked to in awhile - the information suddenly seems <i>fresh</i> rather than repetitive.

I also saw several other people I hadn't seen in awhile. That was kind of weird, but nice. I look forward to my last week before school starts. Suddenly I'm realizing it's approaching sooner than expected - which usually happens - but I'd like to think I am relatively prepared for it. We'll see."

"event","I was recently browsing through PiperBabble (Hamline-related website thing), noticing the rental opportunities for apartments and houses / people selling their cars and suddenly I wish I was older, had more money, was more independent, more responsible, and more financially able to make such huge [financial] decisions. I would love to have my own place. I would love to have my own car. I would love to have my own... everything. These thoughts are weird (new) to me. I want to have my own washer and dryer, spend Sundays reading the paper with a cup of coffee and a basket of clean laundry at my side that needs folding. I want so much to live independently, yet I know it's unrealistic and not financially possible.

Perhaps I'm having these thoughts the more I live at home -- or because my friends are already arranging for their own apartments next year. It's beginning to make me realize how much more I love it at the dorms because I feel so much more independent. There, I totally depend on myself in terms of food (buying groceries, for instance) and laundry and what I do and where I go. I'm cooking my own meals and doing my own laundry in an atmosphere that reminds me every day that I am no at longer home, where I simply exist.

Just some 5:30-6AM things on my mind... I thought I'd write them down. I guess I wonder if anyone's in the same boat sometimes."

"event","Okay, so, I officially love playing <i>Dawn of War: Winter Assault</i>. After the mini LAN party with Matt, Max, (and briefly Ruby!) last night as well as a few games with Max today, I have discovered that amazing things can happen when you upgrade to a Monastary. (Or, just, build an Armory in general.) *sigh* Good day. Also, Max and I went bowling. Of course, I'm usually reminded that I'm not that great at bowling just about every time I go.. but.. it was fun. And Max didn't beat me by <i>that</i> much. :-P

It bothers me that I have nothing planned for tomorrow between the hours of whenever I wake up and work at 5:30PM. Perhaps I'll play Dawn of War. (Or Fable! I have Fable now! Ahh...) I'm pleased.

On another note, I officially have 13.64GB of music thanks to Matt, Max, and the wonderfulness that is ourTunes. :-D

"event","Reading old online journals is weird; I don't know what I expect to find or take from it. It always feels like a constant reminder of how much everything has changed from what it used to be like -- that doesn't have to be a negative thing, it's simply recognizing such change and accepting it for what it is. That, or it's not caring about the old things/thoughts/memories as much as I used to.

On an entirely different note: while most of my friends have gone back to school, I have an additional 2 weeks to prepare myself for next semester. I suppose it would help if I knew what classes I were taking, but I'm wait-listed for the ones I want and refuse to buy books for the ones I'm actually registered for. I'm sure that was a bad idea.

My break is going well; I spent a lot of time with Miles and other friends while they were here. :-) I think as long as I continue to have a social life with those who are still relatively close, I'll be able to maintain sanity for at least the next week or so before I start remembering that I have to eventually go back to school."

"event","I wrote the following on the 7th of January as a means to update my life in three specific events (New Years, Gingerbread Party, and the 24 Hour Play) because that's all that had happened at the time. It started off with no desire to write in the proper sentence/paragraph format, so it's a little sketchy, but an update nonetheless. Perhaps I'll write about more recent events when I feel like it, but until then, this is all I've got. I noticed that I haven't written a public entry since the 31st of December so I figured this could make up for it...

<lj-cut text=""Cut"">

<b>I. New Years</b>
- 2 day (13 hour) road trip :-|
- took a mini tour of Indiana (not much to see; mostly where my dad grew up and downtown Indianapolis)
- no snow!!! just rain
- stayed in an expensive hotel for the wedding
- nice wedding; big church; simple brides maids dresses that made me happy; was reminded by my mother that you have to have a good back on the dress (or a nice back if the dress shows it) in order to keep the attendees interested, seeing as everyone stares at it throughout most of the ceremony
- very formal reception (people being paid to stand there with ordeurve plates)
- got sick after some ordeurves and a salad
- spent the last hour or two of 2005 (+ several hours of 2006) puking, alone in my hotel room (although I must add that my little sister Meaghan left the reception a few minutes to midnight just so I wouldn't be alone for the countdown)
- drove to Chicago the next morning; stayed in a really nice hotel in downtown overlooking the city from the 35th floor
- on the night we arrived, we walked a block or two to ""Uno,"" the first original Chicago-style pizza place. I couldn't eat anything because I was still sick (and didn't end up eating anything the entire rest of the trip), but it was still a cool place.
- took a mini tour of Chicago the next day; trolley to Navy Pier, taxi to the art institute (saw a really nice photography exhibit while my mom looked at the pottery exhibit; took pictures of an armor exhibit for Miles)

<b>II. Gingerbread Party</b>
- went shopping with Miles for the needed supplies of the Gingerbread Party at his house; my Orgasmo-key chain that I received from him for Christmas (which has a button that makes an orgasm sound when pushed) happened to go off in the middle of the aisle while a woman and her little daughter were passing through -- Miles decided it was the most hilarious thing in the world, WHILE REALLY THIS WILL BE A PRESENT MARKED FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS OF EMBARASSMENT. This is something I too would find to be hilarious, but perhaps not so much when it goes off more than 5 times a day
- lots of people arrived for the Gingerbread Party and we almost succesfully built the Empire State building with a marshmellow king kong, however, I am sad to announce for those of you who were not there for all of it, the building collapsed right as we were putting the finishing gum drop touches on it. No one was touching it at the time of the collapse - it just sort of.. happened. And most of it fell into Ruby's lap. I have pictures of the ""before"" and ""after"" shots as I was able to get a lot of what was built before it collapsed. (For the record, it took 6 hours.)
- Ruby, Donna and I ended up staying the night because our plans for Metro Transit didn't sound nearly as appealing when it involved late night walks around strange places (or rather, places one should not walk around in after certain times of the night) and horrible weather to be walking in

<b>III. 24 Hour Play</b>
- oh my goodness it's over.
- for those of you that don't know: the 24-hour play is when you have several writing groups that have 12 hours to write a play (7pm-7am) while the directors, writers, and techs have 12 hours to prepare for it it perform it.
- Ruby, Maura, Donna and I wrote a play closely related to Donna (Ruby's friend from Ireland) and both her fear of birds as well as her withdrawl from cigarettes. We had several ideas having to do with plot, but in the end, in that it-really-feels-like-we're-drunk-because-it's-four-in-the-morning-and-we've-been-writing-since-who-knows-when stage, it didn't really happen. Sinistra, Adrian, Norma, and Tiago are on a train riding across Europe. Sinistra is a middle-aged woman that likes attention; she is on the way to Poland following her husband to see if he's going on ""business trips"" or cheating with ""some tramp down the road."" Adrian (Maura's future husband) is a soft-spoken man who keeps to himself and writes things in his notebook while chain smoking the entire time. Norma is Donna, who is having a hard time quitting smoking and is very fearful of birds. She is on the train because a friend of hers died and gave her a bird to release in the ""wild of Poland."" She hasn't been feeding it for 3 days. Tiago is a 13-year old boy that tries to be older around Sinistra because he is in love with her. He says things like, ""I often ride these rails,"" ""I wonder if he's writing about my dark side,"" and, ""...I'm in a band."" At the climax of the story, they all think they're going to die because there is a flock of bloodthirsty birds dilligently holding ground on the tracks up ahead. :) We had fun.
- Donna & I ended up sticking around for the rest of the day as everyone prepared to perform the plays. I found a room with couches and took a little nap, but for the most part we just sat around trying to find things to keep ourselves awake and entertained.
- The plays went well. Donna seemed pleased with the way Emily Kastral portrayed her character. There were some exceptionally good plays that were perfectly cast, and the overall result of the 24 hour plays was concluded with a lot of tired but amused people.
- At the cast party held immediately afterward, I spent most of my time talking with Frax, Ruby and Stefan. It was very noisy but we found a nice not-so-loud-or-bright secluded area of the kitchen and Frax made me ear plugs. :) I anticipated my time there feeling out of place because Miles was sick and couldn't join me (and I know a lot of the attendees through Miles and not necessarily just school) but I ended up having a great time. At the end of the night we had a floor party (party on the floor of the kitchen); Ruby was making up ""chose your own adventure"" questions for Nikko and Maura was drowsily celebrating her ""I've been up for 40 hours"" stage of existence. People say silly things when they're tired, just as everything becomes highly amusing off of very little sleep.

"event","I filled these out over the course of last week and figured I'd post them even if it's the middle of January.

<lj-cut text=""2005""><b><i>DURING 2005</b></i>
<b>How many girlfriends/boyfriends?</b> one
<b>How many breakups?</b> none
<b>How many crushes?</b> three or four
<b>Care to mention names?</b> The only one of importance is Miles.
<b>Had to say goodbye to?</b> I said goodbye to all of the Annadalians. I specifically remember saying goodbye to Ben's mom at last year's New Years party - she started crying when she was hugging me goodbye. That's probably the most vivid goodbye-memory I have of 2005 other than graduation and the end of the summer.
<b>Missed anyone?</b> yes
<b>Win anything?</b> I'm not sure
<b>Best place you went to?</b> I had a really fun time kayaking in the sea caves with Miles over the summer and camping in a tent by Lake Superior. :) Also, of course, the band trip to New Orleans [ http://www.livejournal.com/users/boxofnaked/19768.html ]
<b>Worst place you went to?</b> I can think of a number of reasons why I shouldn't have gone to the annual New Years party at Ben's house in Annandale a week after we broke up.
<b>How was your birthday?</b> :P It was fun. [ http://www.livejournal.com/users/boxofnaked/18971.html ]
<b>Best present?</b> Pecan-free pecan pie is the first thing I thought of :)
<b><i>FAVORITES OF THE YEAR</i></b>
<b>Movie:</b> Eternal Sunshine (first introduced to me in 2005, and one of my favorites)
<b>Album:</b> The Killers
<b>Song:</b> Gary's adaptation of ""Numa Numa"" was a part of my life for at least 3 months.
<b>Month:</b> I can't pick one specific month, but the entire summer was one of the best I've had.
<b>Lesson you've learned from 2005:</b> It's okay to let go. Let yourself be hurt, let yourself be frustrated or mad, but recognize that things feel so much better once you've realized the importance of letting go and opening your arms to the better parts (and people) of your life.
<b>Hope for the next year:</b> My hope stems from a number of things, including hope that I will continue to be successful in school, that I will start figuring out what it is that I want to do and accomplish with my life, and that I will continue to be surrounded by the people I love.
<b>Clothing item or outfit of the year:</b> My black zip-up hoodie and favorite jeans that I wear all the time
<b>Hairstyle of the year:</b> 2005 was my first year of normalcy after years of dying it.
<b>Jewelry of the year:</b> I rarely wear jewelry anymore, but when I do, I love my pink-pearlish looking beaded necklace that Miles soddered(spl) back together.
<b>Makeup product of the year:</b> N/A
<b>Color of the year:</b> Purple. Somehow I ended up with a purple backpack, a purple body pillow, and a purple hugable soft-and-squishy pillow for college this year. To me, that's a lot of purple for one dorm room.
<b>Car of the year:</b> In the beginning of 2005, my precious Bertha was crushed and died forever. I'd like to give her car of the year. She served me well.
<b>Boy of the year:</b> Miles
<b>Food of the year:</b> Cereal or microwaveable dinners for Shannon and I when we don't have time to eat anything else. That, or cream cheese wontons because they're delicious.
<b>Drink of the year:</b> Shannon introduced me to caramel white mochas- I don't think I can ever go back to regular mochas again.
<b>Class of the year:</b> I loved a lot of the classes I took in my second half of senior year at South as well as my first semester at Hamline. My first thought in response to this question, however, was my third-year Global Feminisms class. I took it originally because I wanted to drop Crime and Justice in America and needed something to replace it, but I ended up being a lot more interested and had a much higher desire to learn than ever expected. Not only did I learn from this class in terms of my own individual thinking, but I learned how to handle the death of our professor in a constructive way by still feeling close to the class and to my work steming from the class. My research started through her guidance with my own perspective, and ended with a colaboration of work from our entire class in dedication to her memory.
<b>Appliance of the year:</b> The microfridge in my dorm room has served me well. Although it's simply a microwave that sits on top of a mini-fridge, it is one wonderful appliance with a name of its own, and I'd recommend it to college students everywhere.
<b>Recreational activity of the year:</b> I have learned to accept and understand the beauty behind LAN parties. Yes, they count, and I have learned many new things because of them.
<b>Means of Communication of the year:</b> AIM.
<b>Gift of the year:</b> I'm pleased with the things I gave other people for Christmas, this year. For myself, I was happy to receive things that showed they were paying attention to my interests (gift certificates to Caffetto's from my little sister, pecan-free pie from Miles) or things that made me laugh (the orgasm key chain).
<b>Holiday of the year:</b> Either my birthday or Christmas
<b>Achievement(s) of the year:</b> Getting good grades; being accepted into a college I wanted to go; getting a job that I like; overcoming the stress and making it out of my first semester alive.
-----------
<b>1. What did you do in 2005 that you've never done before?</b> Graduated from high school, went to Chicago, lived by myself for a week, got drunk enough to throw up, got high enough to pass out, got into a car accident, moved out of the house and into a dorm, got my first cavity, ....and on an entirely different [cheesy yet sincere] note, felt what it truly means to be in love.
<b>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b> I don't think I made any official new years' resolutions. Usually I just wish happiness upon myself and others.
<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b> Not that I know of.
<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b> Yes
<b>5. What countries did you visit?</b> N/A
<b>6. What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005?</b> Pants that fit me. I have pants that are too big, and pants that are too small (or rather, they would fit if I really liked how hip-huggy they are).
<b>7. What dates from 2005 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b> Last year's New Years party at Ben's because of the goodbyes, a few other crappy Ben-and-Morgan-related memories, Ruby's St. Patrick's Day party in mid-March as well as a lot of things associated with Miles, the coma/death of my Global Feminisms prof, the day I learned to hate alcohol, ... I have a very associative memory so a lot of things seem to stay whether I want them to or not.
<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b> See above meme.
<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b> See #13, below. 
<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b> Yes, but nothing major other than the stomach cancer scare.
<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b> I spent $60 on plastic organization storage bins for my dorm room and it was probably the most constructive, wisest shopping decision I have ever made.
<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b> I can think of a number of people including Miles for involving himself in school and making friends through various groups as well as being a wonderful friend and boyfriend, Shannon for being a great roommate and friend, Eric for introducing me to various perspectives of the world (and ""Waking Life""), and others. So many of my friends have accomplished a lot and I am very proud and happy for all of them.
<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b> Ben and Morgan, when I let it get to me, and myself, for the irresponsible decisions that I made.
<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b> Other than <i>college</i>, Christmas presents, and, I liked Ashley's answer: being social (resaurants, concerts, movies, and beverages).
<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b> I remember being really happy and excited when I found out that I got into Hamline. Pretty sure I jumped up and down, actually, after I hung up the phone. So.. there's that. I also get really excited right before I'm about to see people that I haven't seen in awhile. Like when I saw Miles for the first time in a month, or Ruth, because she always makes it exciting when you see her :-). I tend to get really happy when I see people I haven't seen in awhile. Makes sense, I think.
<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2005?</b> Numa Numa, I guess. I was introduced to its wonderfulness in 2005 and it basically changed my life forever. (That, and anything created by Gunther because he's foreign and has a mullet and luscious luscious lips and thinks of genius lines like, ""Ooh.. You touch my tra la la."")
<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
a) Happier or sadder?</b> Hah. Based on the circumstances of last year, I know for a fact that I am much much happier.
<b>b) Thinner or fatter?</b> thinner
<b>c) Richer or poorer?</b> richer
<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b> LET GO. I could not stress this enough.
<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b> 1. Procrastinate. 2. Waste time worrying over things that either don't matter, shouldn't matter, or will get me no where. 3. Waste my time with people that will only end up hurting me in the end when Truth is finally revealed.
<b>20. How did you spend Christmas?</b> It was probably the most laid back Christmas I have ever had. I woke up around noon, ate lunch, and then opened presents with my family.
<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2005?</b> Yes
<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b> Eck. (Hah. You know me. <i>At least</i> one a night. Obviously.)
<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b> I didn't watch enough TV this year to say that I watched anything in particular. (I don't know if I should be okay with that, or kind of disappointed that I didn't waste more time watching TV.)
<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b> Yep. 
<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b> It's been awhile since I've read anything by choice, but I have liked a lot of the books that I've read for school. Sherman Alexie's ""Tonto"" (there's more to the title) wasn't all that bad. I also liked ""Giovanni's Room,"" ""Remembering Babylon,"" ""Woman Warrior,"" and some others that we read in CIS Lit. 
<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b> Pretty German music other than Rammstein. :-D And other things like The Streets or the entire Garden State soundtrack or Bright Eyes, Metric, The Postal Service, Death Cab, etc. Lots of things that have been around for awhile but I am new to listen to them.
<b>28. What did you want and get?</b> Into college, a laptop, money, bus cards.
<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b> 1, It doesn't really matter and 2, I didn't tell anyone I wanted anything specific other than bus cards. A few of the things I thought of to write are things that I plan on purchasing for myself in the near future, so all is well. :-)
<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b> Looking to the above meme, I'd say Eternal Sunshine. I'm not sure if it was actually released this year, but I saw it, and I can think of others, but this is an important one to name.
<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b> :-) There is a link in the first meme.
<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b> Some sort of trip/adventure/vacation with my friends.
<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2005?</b> Simple. Jeans, shirt, zip-up hoodie.
<b>34. What kept you sane?</b> Socializing, freedom, and living out of the house.
<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b> The only moment of celebrity oogling I recall is when Ruby and I saw Micheal Pitt in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch.""
<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b> 1. Gay marriage: The fact that there are restrictions on who can and cannot marry one another, 2. Women's reproductive rights: I believe in a woman's right to choose.
<b>37. Who did you miss?</b> Miles, and other people I hadn't seen in awhile.
<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b> My roommate Shannon. (Plus a lot of Hamline and new-to-me-South folk.)
<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2005:</b> Firstly, I have found that ""<i>if you feel it, say it</i>"" is a nice motto to go by. Secondly [& this is a bit of a repeat, but] I believe it's important to learn to let go, even if you find that it hurts. Let go, and trust that bigger and better things will come from it. Let go, and learn to accept change. Let go of the little things. Acknowledge that you cannot always please everyone around you. Acknowledge that people may react differently toward something than you expected them to. Acknowledge that acceptance and understanding may take time. Learn to love the person you have become. Let go and let yourself breathe in order to remember how good it feels.
<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b> ""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""</lj-cut>"

"event","<br><li>LAN party at Stefan's a few days ago; I was introduced Dawn of War: Winter Assault and ended up playing it from 4:30pm-11pm. After that Frax, Stefan, and Miles played Battlefield while I watched The [horribly depressing] Butterfly Effect. I have definately seen this movie before yet failed to prepare myself for its unhappiness, once again. Ah, well. Great movie.<li>Yesterday I woke up at 2 o'clock to people informing me that we were seeing a movie at 3:45, so I decided to wear my pajamas all day. EmZ, Ange, Miles, Madeline, Christof, Mike and I saw Narnia at the mall followed by the wonderful goodness that is the food court (Panda Express). Good movie -- I haven't read the books but I have the older version of the film, and I have yet to decide which is better. Each movie's actors made the film a bit different. *shrug* Afterwards most of us went back to Miles' place -- and I kicked Mike's ass at pool. :-P (Probably the first and only time that will ever happen, ever. But I was proud.)<li>I had originally planned on visiting Leah earlier today at HCMC, but it turned out that her parents were taking her home for the evening so Miles and I went to her house and had Lefsa with her family. :-) It was good to see her again.

In less than 5 hours (it's 1:12AM), my family and I are leaving on a mini road trip for Indiana; a cousin of mine is getting married on New Years Eve. I haven't decided whether or not I'm excited, but it should be an interesting experience nonetheless. 1, I barely know this side of my family. 2, it's a very-big-deal sort of wedding (I guess it has to be if it's on New Years Eve). 3, my family is.. interesting on road trips. It tends to get rather frustrating, so I'm depending on my notebooks and my headphones for solitude. (I also took that 2005 survey that's circulating around Live Journal and plan on answering it throughout the trip.) We might be making a stop in Chicago on the way back, so if anything, I can look forward to that.

I hope everyone has a wonderful New Years, and I'll be home on Tuesday. :-)"

"event","<lj-cut text=""My official Christmas entry"">Christmas was very laid back this year. My family went to our old church in Maplewood for the Christmas Eve candlelit service -- something I remember doing when I was a kid, which is always a nice memory to re-visit. I may not be a religious person, but I loved the sense of community that that church gave me. They welcomed us with such warm smiles and big hugs; I'm glad I went back this year.

To sum it up, I received a rediculous sum of money (which is not to say that I am not grateful) from my grandma, parents, and various other relatives. I think I had more fun giving gifts this year than ever before - perhaps because I let myself spend what was necessary in order to buy them, and not beat myself up about it later. My mom even said that she was impressed with my gifts -- I think this is the first year where I have truly understood that wonderful emotion expressed when you see someone unwrapping your presents. I mean, I have felt it before, but not at all to this extent. Meaghan was especially surprised and happy, and it made me so glad to see that she loved everything I got for her. (I was good this year. I paid attention. I'll give myself props.)

When I was asked what I wanted for Christmas, all I could think of in response were Super Saver bus cards. It's hard to tell my parents to get me anything else when I'm attending an expensive private liberal arts school and I really don't <i>need</i> anything. I've been thinking about what to do with the money I received.. a part of me wants to not spend any of it and put it in savings. Another part wants to indulge and get a few things for myself -- like the Post Secrets book, a not-so-marshmellowy coat, or a video-capturing device (maybe a new digital camera?).. but do I really <i>need</i> any of that? It's much easier spending money on other people than on myself. At least the $20 Caffetto's gift certificate from my sister will be happily spent. :-)</lj-cut>

Happy Holidays to you all. I hope you're having a wonderful break. :-)"

I have learned about various aspects of psychology, discussed the relationship between vampirism and sex in Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> as it is used to emphasize Victorian ideals on women's sexuality by comparing desexualized and hypersexualized females (phew), and I have extensively researched the sex trade and its affect on a woman's sense of self.

<b>I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.</b>

Also, my Global Feminisms class compiled a binded booklet of our research in dedication to our professor who recently passed away. I feel so much a part of these 126 pages- not only because my research is in the booklet, but because I suggested the idea for the title as well as wrote a lot of the overall conclusion that was used in the final copy. I was a part of something so much more than I ever expected; I was a part of a class that I hesitantly joined full of juniors and seniors that immediately accepted me, and an amazing professor that challenged all of us. Togther, we made this amazing piece of work and together, we are whole.

<center><i>Inspired by Tania: Looking at Feminism in a Global Context
A collaboration of research in memory of Professor Tania Forte</i>
<lj-cut text=""An excerpt of the conclusion""></center>
""<i>Tania has left us with an earnest desire to assist and encourage women around the world to speak out. She was an amazing women and a beloved professor who will forever remain in our hearts. She became our guiding star, inspiring and changing us in a way we will never forget. We dedicate this compilation to her as a way of showing how she truly influenced each one of our lives, challenging us to think outside the box and grow as individuals. She exhibited so much knowledge and such a desire to learn, and it spread feverishly to us, helping to expand our learning far beyond the topic of feminism in a global context.

To a wonderful woman; a women who touched the lives of everyone she met through her wisdom, her inspiration, her radiating spirit, her open mind and heart, and her illuminating smile. To a woman who was always excited to learn and went out into the world (the whole world, from France to Israel to Egypt) to study and share her knowledge and excitement with everyone she met. No one could forget how special a person you were. You inspired everyone you touched and made us think critically as you played devils advocate to our unending barrage of questions. You introduced new, insightful, and challenging questions into our discussions and made us excited to go to class. You made us look forward to presenting our final projects, and we hope that you would be proud of the work we have accomplished.

Tania Forte, this is for you. May you forever rest in peace.</i>""</lj-cut>"

I don't think that memory will ever escape me, yet it once made me happy knowing that I hurt them back.

"event","I'm not sure what to say about yesterday. I'm not sure about what's important to write about at this point and what's insignificant.

The day started out well. Shan and Ali took metro transit for the first time to the mall and I was very proud of them. I joined them shortly after I showered and we walked around, ate, spent money, etc. I spent a lot more than I anticipated, but I'm pleased with what I got.

Afterwards I took the bus back to Hamline and Ashley and I went to the Korn concert. As expected, it was amazing. Even better than last year because of the smaller venue and the fact that we were closer to the stage. I remember a euphoric feeling coming over me to a point where I was convinced that I would pass out. Ashley said she saw a face that she only ever sees at concerts. It was an amazing feeling, being part of the crowd, being part of this giant Whole. The wait to get inside was entirely worth it. Natalie - an old best friend - spotted me, and Ashley and I were able to avoid a significant section of the line by joining her and the others. I remember my feet being so cold that they hurt, but the concert was still worth it. I wanted this entry to be dedicated to that feeling - that ecstatic euphoria that I only ever feel during concerts. It would have been called, ""All day I dream about sex"" with the picture I took of Jonathan Davis and an attempt to describe what the feeling was like.

After the concert, Ashley and I met Mallory and Brittanie - old friends of mine from middle school - at a nearby Perkins. Mallory and Brittanie told me stories of all the girls that had gotten pregnant and had babies since I last saw them. I can think of at least 6. I saw the pictures of their babies and could not believe I was living in an entirely different world from them. What would have happened, had I stayed in North St. Paul? What would have happened, had I stayed in my comfort bubble that I developed for over 10 years, completely ignorant to the world around me, and completely consumed by the pointless drama that was kept on the inside? Although I blame a lot of things on moving around, I'm still glad it happened, because I know I would be an entirely different person living an entirely different life, had I stayed.

Ashley and I went to Caffetto's for hot beverages and then she drove me home. I don't remember what time I got back, but what happened afterwards feels like it should have been an entirely different day. I remember bits and pieces of the night that followed, so I will do my best to tell you about it.

<lj-cut>I arrived back at my dorm room and Shannon and AJ said they wanted to get drunk. This is very out of character for both of them (as well as myself) but I agreed that it would be nice as I hadn't done it in a long time and my concert-high was fading. I remember prefacing the night by holding my cup in the air and saying, ""to the first time I've been drunk at college."" The three of us toasted (although it was neither of their first times), and that's how it began. I took shot after shot, with the simple desire to be drunk. I drank more than I ever thought possible in a span of only 45 minutes. Shan was just as gone as I was. I remember the irony of Shan and I being wasted and the usual drunks coming back to their dorm sober. I remember their faces going from amused to concerned and worried. I remember lying on the bathroom floor with voices surrounding me and not being able to move. I remember the paramedics putting a horrible scent under my nose that made my nostrils burn to wake me up. I remember hearing questions and voices from the paramedics and other people surrounding me but not being able to see anything. I remember people saying that I was turning blue. I remember being somewhat aware of what was going on but I wasn't able to respond or control anything. The paramedics didn't take me to the hospital because I started throwing up a lot of it and eventually started to respond again. I kept hitting my head on the toilet, or falling down hard onto the floor to a point where I remember Jordan saying, ""oh, god"" and heard so many worried people all around me. I was dragged back to my dorm room where we found Shannon lying on a mattress that was placed on the floor in a pile of her own puke. This is the worst either of us had ever been. There were so many people taking care of us. Caleb, Matt, and Kevin were outside of our door until 7 in the morning looking after us while Jordan was trying to wash the puke off of Shannon's bedding and Lauren was helping a still-very-gone-Shan wash the puke out of her hair and body in the shower. We remember very little of any of this.

I can't tell you how thankful I am to everyone that was there with us last night. Margaret, Emily, Tara, Matt, Caleb, AJ- who ended up not having that much to drink because we apparently took it from her, Jordan, Jake, and Lauren. Shannon and I agree that we have incredible friends and we are so lucky and greatful for them. I'm afraid to think about what would have happened had they not been there, or had they been just as drunk as we were. (Since I wrote this entry, I've learned that even more people were here that I don't even remember, but I'm thankful for everyone.)

Shan and I woke up on the mattresses that were prepared for us on the floor with a bottle of water and a trash can to puke in. We could not believe what happened. We each remember some of it, but throughout the day have heard more and more from the people that were there. I was overcome with a feeling of absolute disgust. We decided to get ourselves up, still feeling drunk, brush our teeth, and take a shower. So we did that, which helped, but I was still feeling sick. My world continued to spin and my body was in so much pain. After our showers various people came in to check up on us and told us more about what happened. I tried walking to Ali's room with Shannon, but the physical energy made me feel like puking again so after I puked a few more times, I spent most of the day on one of the mattress in our room. Shan was getting better and came back every once and awhile with more information to the puzzle that we've pieced together.

I remember crying, wanting so badly for Miles to be there and hold me, rubbing my stomach, telling me that everything was going to be okay. I thought about calling him, but I didn't want to wake him up and also just felt too sick to talk - <i>moving</i> made me sick - and I wouldn't be able to explain what happened without crying. I just wanted him to be there; knowing that he couldn't be made me cry.

I eventually walked around the dorms apologizing, thanking and hugging a lot of people as I heard more of the story. Everyone was so afraid. Knowing that I made them <i>that scared</i> hurts. Regardless of how far gone Shan and I were, we had amazing friends that were taking care of us - especially Lauren, our CA, who saw the worst of it. I saw the pictures, which I remember taking, but looking at them and thinking about the night is still so surreal. Drinking anything at this point reminds me of it. It took awhile to be able to eat something, but I eventually ended up having some soup and watching part of Finding Neverland until I fell back asleep. Shan has been spending the last few hours in the laundry room trying to salvage her blankets and sheets. I still can't believe what happened or how far gone we were. 

Thank god for our amazing friends, as I don't know what would have happened without them.

<b>UPDATE:</b> [12:30AM] Lauren recently informed me that I had a mild concusion, after having fallen through the bathroom stall, breaking the latch, and hitting my head on the ground. Jordan says I was lying there for 45 minutes before she showed up; she saw that I was turning purple, my fists kept clenching up, and I was falling in and out of consciousness. She had to call the paramedics because she couldn't get me to wake up.

How fucking scary it that.</lj-cut>"

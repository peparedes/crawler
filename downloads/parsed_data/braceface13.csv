"event","Today was really fun I went over melissa's house!! While I was there we went swiming and went for a walk where we found Ryan! Then we went back 2 melissy's house and swam w/ him and then we dried off and talked 4 a lil! To my surprise  Ryan picked me up and threw me in the pool when I just got dried off so I still have to hurt him for that!

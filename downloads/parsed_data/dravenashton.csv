"event","Is actually a fun read.&nbsp; Israel is incredibly dense and forgetful.&nbsp; How many miracles does God act in the wilderness, and how quick are they to rebell against God and grumble about their circumstances.&nbsp; So narrow sighted, and so dense and forgetful.&nbsp; They complain about their circumstances, cry out in despair when they're about to be consumed by God...and the cycle continues.&nbsp; Isn't that the case with the church though?&nbsp; We are dense and dumb as they were.&nbsp; We may mock them for being fools, but how many times do we turn from God and pursue our own pleasure, telling Him that His way is foolish and that we had it better on our own (which in it's essence is the very pride that all sin has its roots).&nbsp; How quick are we to cry out and beg from despair when we begin to taste the consequences for our insubordination.&nbsp; We are as dumb as they, trading the tender mercies and graces of God for filth.

Then there's the picture of Moses and Aaron.&nbsp; They had to put up with this congregation, but in almost every circumstance of grumbling and rebellion they fall on their faces and humbly plead with the people to change, and when God threatens to consume the entire congregation they intercede on the peoples behalf as divine providence ordained so that the Lords testing of them endures and God keeps his promise to His people.&nbsp; They are yet a mere shadow of Christ who came to be the true intercessor between God and man, who made the only lasting atonement for sin, and who mediates without haste or anger to God our Father on our behalf, lest we should be swept up in God's wrath!

How unlike Moses and Aaron, even more unlike Christ, we are.&nbsp; How often we resemble Israel.&nbsp; God help us and change us to be Holy."

"event","Al Mohler had a very interesting blog regarding homosexuality.  The <a href=""http://albertmohler.com/blog_read.php?id=891"">entire article </a>should be read, but here are his 10 points of consideration for any ""Christians who are committed to think in genuinely Christian terms"".<br /><br />1. There is, as of now, no incontrovertible or widely accepted proof that any biological basis for sexual orientation exists.<br /><br />2. Nevertheless, the direction of the research points in this direction. Research into the sexual orientation of sheep and other animals, as well as human studies, points to some level of biological causation for sexual orientation in at least some individuals.<br /><br />3. Given the consequences of the Fall and the effects of human sin, we should not be surprised that such a causation or link is found. After all, the human genetic structure, along with every other aspect of creation, shows the pernicious effects of the Fall and of God's judgment.<br /><br />4. The biblical condemnation of all homosexual behaviors would not be compromised or mitigated in the least by such a discovery. The discovery of a biological factor would not change the Bible's moral verdict on homosexual behavior.<br /><br />5. The discovery of a biological basis for homosexuality would be of great pastoral significance, allowing for a greater understanding of why certain persons struggle with these particular sexual temptations.<br /><br />6. The biblical basis for establishing the dignity of all persons -- the fact that all humans are made in God's image -- reminds us that this means all persons, including those who may be marked by a predisposition toward homosexuality. For the sake of clarity, we must insist at all times that all persons -- whether identified as heterosexual, homosexual, lesbian, transsexual, transgendered, bisexual, or whatever -- are equally made in the image of God.<br /><br />7. Thus, we will gladly contend for the right to life of all persons, born and unborn, whatever their sexual orientation. We must fight against the idea of aborting fetuses or human embryos identified as homosexual in orientation.<br /><br />8. If a biological basis is found, and if a prenatal test is then developed, and if a successful treatment to reverse the sexual orientation to heterosexual is ever developed, we would support its use as we should unapologetically support the use of any appropriate means to avoid sexual temptation and the inevitable effects of sin.<br /><br />9. We must stop confusing the issues of moral responsibility and moral choice. We are all responsible for our sexual orientation, but that does not mean that we freely and consciously choose that orientation. We sin against homosexuals by insisting that sexual temptation and attraction are predominately chosen. We do not always (or even generally) choose our temptations. Nevertheless, we are absolutely responsible for what we do with sinful temptations, whatever our so-called sexual orientation.<br /><br />10. Christians must be very careful not to claim that science can never prove a biological basis for sexual orientation. We can and must insist that no scientific finding can change the basic sinfulness of all homosexual behavior. The general trend of the research points to at least some biological factors behind sexual attraction, gender identity, and sexual orientation. This does not alter God's moral verdict on homosexual sin (or heterosexual sin, for that matter), but it does hold some promise that a deeper knowledge of homosexuality and its cause will allow for more effective ministries to those who struggle with this particular pattern of temptation. If such knowledge should ever be discovered, we should embrace it and use it for the greater good of humanity and for the greater glory of God."

"event","i decided to start doubling my blogs here so everyone else can read them and comment.  anyway, im only starting the most recent, if you want to read previous blogs, you have to visit http://blog.myspace.com/hisnameextoled

anyway, here is my last post.


""May I speak each word as if my last word, and walk each step as my final one. If my life should end today, let this be my best day."" - taken from the prayer ""Morning Dedication"" in The Valley Of Vision

Such a simple idea on the surface. Who wouldn't want their best day to be their last. I was thinking about this, and I don't know of anyone who would want to leave a legacy that was consummated in a final moment of mediocrity. Normally, I am led to believe, that people would want their last moment to be one of glory. Glory. Can there be anything better than to live a glorious life? Fame, power, wealth, is there a pursuit that is not rooted in glory? Whose glory? That is the focal point here, and it is the deciding factory behind this prayer's closing statement. We as Christians do not seek our glory, we do not seek our own will. It would be a shame to die in the process of sinning against Christ, our Lord, and stand before Him in the shame of what we were just engaging in. Sure we'll be in heaven being children of God, but how pathetic a way to be entered through the gates of heaven, then be called out of a shameful act! This is precisely what this prayer is praying against. We know not when our ordained time to die is, so the only way to avoid such a sad predicament is to live every moment as one that glorifies our Lord, and not one that glorifies ourselves (tho it truly disgraces ourselves, but we are a deceived people when we sin glory in sin).

""May I speak each word as if my last word..."" What is so important with how we speak? It is so easy to be caught up in the moment and let our tongue be careless. Slander, gossip, using the Lord's name improperly, lying, boasting (in anything but Christ), engaging in aimless debates and trivialities, there are so many ways that our speech can be used improperly. To have this aim means that, I do not want to engage in any idle speech! I don't want to be anything less than edifying when I converse with the other saints! I do not want to meet my Maker speaking anything shy of a completely admirable glorification of His excellence! Oh, what a great goal!

""...and walk each step as my final one."" There are countless things we could choose to do. Plenty of places we can choose to go, and plenty of ways we can choose to spend our time. The path of righteousness, the way to heaven, is a narrow and restrictive path. There are many things we ought not to do, and sometimes they seem devilishly delightful. What we choose to do with our time, will it be for the glory of God? Where will I be found when Christ comes for me? Oh, that I am doing something worthy of His glory!

These lines, as simple as they may be, are in fact so hard to live by. However, if we do live by them, they will be of much profit and will benefit us greatly as we live lives of obedience and glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. We do not know the time God has ordained for us to die, and we will never know. The only way that we can be sure that we meet our Lord, when we die, in a glorious state (for His glory), we must have this goal: that every moment is our last and we strive every moment to do what we ought to do. To live a life that has this as it's aim would be incredible and would ascribe much glory to God, as we should desire. I do no justice to this idea. I merely give some pondering, but consider them for yourself, and see if a live fulfilling such a prayer would not be one worth striving for. All glory to God. Let our lives be worthy of such a calling as we were called by God."

He was active in lifting up John Piper for prayer with his battle with prostate cancer, and now its Pipers turn to be faithful in lifting up Alistair with the same struggle.  So just for those of you who remember, keep Alistair (and Piper) in your prayers for their battle with prostate cancer.  Thanks, and all glory in all circumstances to God."

"event","I took the scenic back road from Bakersfield and was listening to Coldplay - Politik (live) and towards the end of the song, the climax, i was completely enraptured.  The best I can describe it is euphoria.  My emotions seemed to sail into the heavens, a great peace and joy fell over me, and I was totally enraptured.  Now I would usually just end here, be happy with the song, but this time God spoke.  ""As beautiful this sound is to your ears, it is as nothing to the choirs in heaven.""  I realized, every sensory blessing, whether it be a song, scenery, another person, a great work of art, a beautiful poem, a delicious food or drink, the touch of a loved one, whatever it is that we can find some enjoyment in, these are all blessings from God who if you are open to the softening of your heart and the fine tuning of your senses will meet you in the midst of your enjoyment and give you a glimpse of His glory, supreme above ALL things.  So if you are willing, seek God when your senses are at their peak, and taste and see that the Lord is great and greatly to be praised, and know how majestic and beautiful and perfect He is and how much joy we can see in Him.  Our senses enjoying His creation are his design for us to see a glimpse of His glory.  Amen and be blessed richly by Him!"

"event","Scarlet Rain


The light coming through narrow window's view
Illuminates the eyes of the man left inside
His spirit so bold now prostrate and old
His face once full of youth now haunted by the dead
Removed from the world around him with memories to haunt his soul

Softly in the distance he heard the rain coming
Just a gentle spray he began to pray
Nearing closer to the house it started to pour
Rain scarlet red steady overhead
Memories of youth come to mind; summer days on a grassy knoll

The irony of this light mixed with rain
The man's spirit carried his body from it's pain
By grace the man's spirit was born anew
A change not his own stirring from within it grew

A sadness lifted his focus shifted
No longer among the dead must he still confide
Walk out of his home a world here to roam
Cast his sight upon the saviour by which he's led
Take a final view upon his home now dark as a prison cell

Exploring this new world the man was found humming
But wolves found prowling as some start howling
The man unaware of what dangers are in store
Stumble in the dark wolves now see their mark
As night falls the lion kept guard over the man's life as he fell

The liberty the man began to see
Was not a yoke to be wreckless and remain free
For around him lurked evil still unknown
He clung to the lion and waited to be shown

A life almost wasted with no regret; the lamb had made him whole
He looked through the world of black and saw light leading away from hell"

<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Robot</B></FONT><BR>You are 57% Rational, 28% Extroverted, 14% Brutal, and 14% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Robot! You are characterized by your rationality. In fact, this is really ALL you are characterized by. Like a cold, heartless machine, you are so logical and unemotional that you scarcely seem human. For instance, you are very humble and don't bother thinking of your own interests, you are very gentle and lack emotion, and you are also very introverted and introspective. You may have noticed that these traits are just as applicable to your laptop as they are to a human being. In short, your personality defect is that you don't really HAVE a personality. You are one of those annoying, super-logical people that never gets upset or flustered. Unless, of course, you short circuit. 
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more RATIONAL than intuitive. 
<P>2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 
<P>3. You are more GENTLE than brutal. 
<P>4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant.</I>
<P>
<P><B>Compatibility:</B>
<P>Your exact opposite is the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=100&score2=100&score3=100"">Class Clown</A>. 
<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=0&score3=0"">Hand-Raiser</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=0&score1=0&score2=0&score3=0"">Emo Kid</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=0&score2=0&score3=100"">Haughty Intellectual</A>. 
<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

      1How blessed is he who considers the helpless;
         The LORD will deliver him in a day of trouble. 
      2The LORD will protect him and keep him alive,
         And he shall be called blessed upon the earth;
         And do not give him over to the desire of his enemies. 
      3The LORD will sustain him upon his sickbed;
         In his illness, You restore him to health. 
      4As for me, I said, ""O LORD, be gracious to me;
         Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."" 
      5My enemies speak evil against me,
         ""When will he die, and his name perish?"" 
      6And when he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood;
         His heart gathers wickedness to itself;
         When he goes outside, he tells it. 
      7All who hate me whisper together against me;
         Against me they devise my hurt, saying, 
      8""A wicked thing is poured out upon him,
         That when he lies down, he will not rise up again."" 
      9Even my close friend in whom I trusted,
         Who ate my bread,
         Has lifted up his heel against me. 
      10But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up,
         That I may repay them. 
      11By this I know that You are pleased with me,
         Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me. 
      12As for me, You uphold me in my integrity,
         And You set me in Your presence forever. 
      13Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
         From everlasting to everlasting.
         Amen and Amen. 

Today is not a very happy day.  It's not bad, for God has been gracious and kept me from danger and harm.  But I have a messed up stomach from bad sausage last night.  My movie date with Grace, the greatest girl in the world, was cancelled because she had to go back to santa barbara and work on a report.  I also generally feel alone.  But inspite of all of these things that try to weigh at me...God is so amazing and despite my bible study with Gordon and Mike being sort of...tiresome, reading God's word on my own is still amazing. God brought me through the rains last night, and kept me from falling asleep on my way home, I was very close.  Something ironic happened.  I went to the baptist church in Tehachapi when I visited my parents, overall a good church.  But people kept introducing themselves to me, and I suck at names, so they remembered mine, but I'd always forget theirs.  ha  However, this one girl, very pretty, introduced herself to me and talked to me a bit.  Her name was Allana.  Anyway, when she went back to her seat, she said ""Goodbye John Knox, whats my name?""  I was a bit uncomfortable, since I didn't remember.  But she told it to me and that kindof put a mental note in my head.  Anyway, on the way home last night I was drifting off...and I decided to get off and get a drink to keep me awake in Lancaster (which is 40 min from Tehachapi).  Anyway, I get out of my car and I hear this ""John"" being called, and when I turned around it was Allana and her family.  We all said hi and then bid each other farewell, but it was ironic.  40 min from their home, and me on my way out of town...stopping at the same gas station at the same time.  God works out some interesting scenarios.  hehe  Oh well...I am alive, and overall well so praise God.  There are many less fortunate than I."

It is not we who must make ourselves love God.  It is God who must make us, and direct us to love Him.  We, by the same token, cannot become patient.  The patience with which Christ has, the divine patience of God, is likewise a gift from God from His direction in our lives, and not an attainable virtue by our own account.  I pray that each one of us is granted these gifts, because we need them dearly."

new years and chritsmas were fun

i got to eat dinner with grace friday, and i get to see her later today!  yippee!

i got into 2 political fights, and 1 religious fight today:
*political 1-i got owned...because i argue without a real opinion...and had little to no facts
*political 2-i was arguiong my friend aziz, who hates israelis because theyre israeli, and they hate him...and he thinks he deserves to hate them becuase they hate him, and he thinks they have no right to hate him.  i think hes full of crap
*religious-aziz claimed to be a christian.  he acknowledges that all people are naturally bad.   but he was offended when i said that all people have sinned.  i then asked him if he had a conscience, and he said yes, and i asked him if he ever disobeyed it, and he said yes...and i concluded that right there proves my point that all people have sinned which led him to ask how people go to heaven if thats the case, and i said by the grace and mercy of God, and he said i was nuts.  here i thought that a fundamental christian belief was that all people were sinners and it was by grace we were saved. *drenching with sarcasm*

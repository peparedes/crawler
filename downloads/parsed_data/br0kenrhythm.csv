Sorry? Beg your parden?
Misinformed. 

Just for you all to know, really shouldn't believe everything your precious ears hear. Your diligent eyes read and whatever other ways you rely on to get your information.

Believe in nothing.
Think for yourself.

I am what I am... and no matter what others may like to believe. I'm not: Insane, Incapable, Delusional, Diseased, Dishonest, Dysfunctional enough to pull off harmful hurtful acts time and time again.  I live in the same fucking world that you do, and I do the same fucking things any honest person does, perhaps I'm a little nicer though. Because I believe in everyone being individuals, having choices, have their own life.
I care about those who care about me. 

And I have been fucked over millions of times for it."

I woke up, so obviously i must have fell asleep even though ic an remember when i did...
I woke up shaking, and cryin, and very hot. I was burning up, and my headache was there but 100 times worse. It felt as if razorblades were cutting through my head..  I had been dreaming.. about complications and events with nick. That happened when he was inc ollege
It hurt.
It hurt deep.
It was a very emotional time.
Some of you, if you knew about it would think that it wasnt a big deal.
It was to me.
Nobody will understand the pain i feel, you will understand pain.. yes.
But not this exact pain, or my exact reasons for feeling them
I felt them again last night,
I don't know..
I don't know..
last day of school, big english final. here i come. Computer and all :(
I will not fall, completely, again."

I love that people think they are so superior to me, and so much more grown up yet they are the ones making a big deal out of things. I'm not aying try my hardest.. and you just don't give a shit.  You made up your mind, on false accusations and lies. That day will never come huh? A fucking mistake makes me ""in your books"" a fucking ugle piece of shit whom in your WHOLE LIFETIME will never forgive. Since your fucking 17 right now, maybe in a few years you will grow up and realize whats ""really"" going on.... before you go and decide the rest of your life.
To me, youve hurt me just as much as i've ""hurt"" you. But in your mind.. i'm sure that doesn't mean shit. It's all about you..

""Fuck you. You went behind my back, you did exactly what you practically promised me you would never do. You are just my brothers girlfriend to me and thats all you'll ever be after this. You ruined every chance you ever had of being friends with me. I was just starting to trust you again and trying to be friendly and shit. Too late, game over -.-
I will not lie in my journal, I posted exactly what my brothers note said to me and my exact thoughts. I don't lie like you Kristy. I hate to lie. Esspesialy to my FRIENDS -.- I'm not the one who freaked out last time, so don't talk like I'm the one who was talking ""imaturely."" I remember clearly asking you to calm down and you yelled at me. Ha. I don't have to ""try"" to make you look horrible in my journal, because in my book, you are already as ugle as it gets. 
But yeah, incase you didn't notice, I had already done the forgetting and forgiving, and it's really too bad you had to go and screw it up like you did. Ah well, I don't really care anyways. 
Oh, and don't be waiting too long for that day I want to come ""talk"" and ""understand"" heh, cuz it won't ever come.""

Do you like to critisize me?
Do you like to mock my every fucking word or action?
Your just as fucked up as i am, and if you haven't realized that by now then your pretty fucking arrogant. 
>:O>:O>:O

 		     I want this to be a long entry.

Anyway,I had the best time i had ina  while tonight while driving, I had the music up real loud, and iw as singing at the top of my lungs, yelling, angry and lovely. It was a very real beautiful experience. With the sun going down,a nd me cruising down the hills and around the turns... It was a great moment. 

Ah, now i feel better... I talked to kate earlier,.. :). i enjoyed it.. i miss ya kate! Coyote Ugly is on right now, bah. I remember when i like loved that movie.. now when is ee it i tthink,.. blah blah blah.. SHITTY SHITTY SHITTY bang bang bang. Cablop. Stinky.
I like austrailian accents. Heh its funy that they cut out some parts in this movie.. and get this,. the girl comes in, fills up her bathtub.. reaches in her pocket gets money and just decides to open the door to go shopping? While the bathtub is filling...??But luckiliy the guy she just saw is right outside the door! HA! and she has a cat in her apartment? You only see it once the whole movie, makes ya wonder if it was ever even there at all'? haha. sorry i like to pick apart movies alot. Possibley becuase one day.. i want to write a script for a movie that will blow people away, something real, fulfilling, interesting and like nothing ever seen. It will leave something with every person who seens it. Ah..
haha my favorite part.. theres a huge fight in the bar.. but somehow her singing  gets the attention of the WHOLE crowd, .. and stops like a million fights, and people that were just two seconds behind the bar stealing alcohol.. to stop their vandalism, and their fun.. and watch this girl sing this song.. YEAH! 
Thats enough, i wont make fun of it anymore. ANd plus. if anybody at all is reading this.. im sure you are all getting bored.
I often question myself on my intelligence..? Its like, when i think about it.. i feel so way ahead of alot of people. Yet, i dont do really great in school, and i feel like i will do real bad on my SATS. > to contradict myself*kinda* i dont htnk getting good grades ins chool means your smart, i think it means your not lazy, and a few other reasons. But i do think SATS mean more.. but i dont know.. my mind is just a big bunch of mixed up words and numbers, with wires disconnecting and  starting fire in the corners of my brain. This is going to be a really long entry.. so just to remind you of that. If you dont want to read alot.. stop now.
I want to make a list of things i want to accomplish or have or do(that i can think of right now) in my lifetime> its fun,, and i think iot can tell alot about people.. you should do it too ;)

*Write or direct a movie (also would LOVE to act in it..)
*Learn russian
*Write a book
*Own a really great camera, and take really beautiful pictures, and have many of people see them. heh heh
*Publish a book of my poetry/slash sketches to go along with all of them.. Along with random thoughts/mindless ramblings and inspirations from the dying world around me. 
* Sing onstage, and be in a band.. where people can hear me sing.. scream and cry, as well as sing along with my words.. 
*Travel to europe, and possibley live for an amount of time
*Write or tell somehow.. my thoughts of creation, religion..a nd millions of other things.
*Communicate.. write or sing with Maynard James Keenan
*Make millions of friends, and leave alot with them.. through my words feeling and love for them. To help them out as much as i can.. to pass kindess and beauty on through the world..
* To have my meaning full tattoos fulfilled.
Okay so i can think anymore.. i think meds are kicking in. Even though now mayeer hwo hard i try i hardly ever get drowsy enough to falla sleep.. ah *sigh*
P.S.. these all might seem very impossible.. but i am very motivated.. and even if i dont accomplish all of them, i will try my hardest to do the best i can.. to get the most out of this life. 

So.. i wish i had brough tmy art in, ms dyer said she woul dhaveb put it up for the art show, even if im not in art. Oh well. I would have loved that.
Yep, i cant WAIT for tasha to make me a shirt :) :) and to h an gou t with her more, out of school. I love tasha, shes one of my favorite people. Im so glad ive gotten to know her. wee wee wee

I guess this is a long enough entry for now.



_*_*_*_*_
I see her moving, not a single bone in her body that isn't factitious
So..unwelcoming, after disposing of her innocence with another tyrant in the janitors closet
Fear escorted her to the nearest sink to fix the face she misuses everyday
Cotton swab gently gliding acrossed her porcelain like suit
hoping her foundation will disguise her of any faults
..she just can't seem to adjust in this skin.

Solely for pleasure she bangs her wrists off the lining of the hand dryer
everything is prettier when twisted with the affair of silver and pain
she endures in the numb doubt she has possessed
platinum aspired, beauty queen

Throw's herself into a stall, where she collapses momentarily
As she exerts herself and disposes of anything left in her stomach
She wishes she was young and could experience no wrath
As when cuts were covered by a pink band aid with several resemblances

She's anger, patiently waiting for a cause
Now distinguished that she is miserable
Need's to take a new turn from the usual ritual
Maybe later she will find a new bathroom to die in

Sadly, sanity has left her hanging by a thread
Now she hould climb back into her garbage pail perception
...A bulimic erotica searching for solace
Drowned in the strange abyss of her childhood memories
~kes


Love youa ll, well not all.. but anybody meaningful enough to read this.. and care.

People are responsible, or reliable.. ever. Or at least thats how it seems. I wish people could just be more considerate of others.. really.. this generation of minds seem to be more and more narcissistic and insensitive. 
mm hashbrown
Yeah so tedianne just got here. and i asked about the project and she was just like.. its monday.. youa ctually expected us to come?
Ugh I was suposed to go over kates sunday, or at least thats what i thought.. but i forgot it was my moms birthday.a nd i tried to find kates number to call her.. but i couldnt find it and she doesn thave aol  at her house...
so that sucked. And i really hope shes not mad. because it was a mistake. I would never stand someone up.. Speaking of kate, i wonder if her or tasha are here yet. This orange juice tastes weird, and i want another granola bar.
Man, i dont know if i want to give blood today or not. Ill probably go and see if i can get tested either way though i have low iron. Blah
I wish i could skip math.. I hate it. You have no idea how much i do...
I wish i had more positive updates. Or.. i dont know.. something exciting or beautiful. I wish i was something exciting or beautiful. 
. I dont know if it was worth it to spend my own money on a yearbook. I dont know.. im only in the yearbook once this year. Ha. It makes me laugh. Next year ill probably be involved in alot more. I really cant wait to graduate.. and start my life. To explore and witness everything ina  different way. It'll be a real eye opener. 
This weekend was okay, i experienced some things i never had before.. but it kind of secretly disappointed me. Oh well. Everythings overrated. This summer i want to do some really fun stuff. different stuff. I wanna road trip it. 
Well this is enough for now i guess."

Ive been to passionate with what everything really means to me. My present, past and future.. i spend so much time pondering, and punishing myself for. There is so much I want to accomplish, but it seems like everything is so slow and i will never get there. So much is going on inside that i want to explode. I constantly wish there was some way i could accomplish more right now. I am trying to get more and more to do.. learn new things, and just try to expand my horizons. Im interested in so many things, and i want to express myself in more and more ways. I feel like i need more of a change of what im doing right now.  Phew. life is so complicated. Its so spontaneous.. you'll think something going some way and then whoomsh. shit happens. Well i wanted to make this alot longer but the bells going to ring. Yay for tonight.. ill be up for a long time.. doing homework after i get home from a chorus concert. ew i love singing more then anything.. but i hate chorus? and the man who thinks he is musically gifted who rules the class.

Maynard James Keenan.... and I... wow. we have a connection. All of you will never understand what i mean, because its undescribable. Eventually, I will have what i need and be where i need to be to express myself through similiar ways as him. Yes.
I have been slacking off alot on homework lately. School work in general really.. I just haven;t had the motivation. Plus ive been doing all kinds of other stuff.. and have had alot of things going on emotionally, and yeah blah. Got a real good technique of hemping done last night. So soon enough, im goign to make a bunch of bracelets and chokers.. and let my friends choose which they want. :) Im going to make one special for nick though, hes my love.
This Entry is probably going to be rather long, for I haven't updated in like a week and i feel like I owe it to livejournal. Plus the voice in my head is being quite the chattermouth right now...s o i better let him havea chance to talk.
I'm trying to get more things in order. I have my license. I have been driving on my own, and it has  thrilled me beyond belief. I need to get more job applications.  I got some a while back and nobody ever called me :( tis okay though. Ill teach those bastards whose boss. Im afraid of taking SATS. I feel like i am going to do.. soooo bad. I suck so horribley at testing, its my worst thing. Right behind math that is. Which is on there, and which ruins a portion of it for me. Since i've hardly ever even gotten higher then a 77 in my whole math history. Thankfully, next year there will be no math for me. Mostly English type things,. along with some science, government.. acting and film making.. as well as photography. Some of which i might go for in college. I was thinking about rockport college, but in a way i would rather go to an universtiy so i can expand and take alot of classes i want. Not just focus on one major. Maybe try to major in 2 things, which would be INCREDIBLEY difficult. But oh well. Rockport would only allow me to study my film and photographyand such im going to do. If i went to a university.. i want to take writing, poetry, some literature, photography, film making<_- one of those 2 might be a majoring in,. I would also really like to take a language.. preferebly RUSSIan. because i am really quite amazed and interested in it. I want to adopt a russian kid, but shhhh. 
In the library, this is fucking boring. Kate better get in here! i had to kill someone to get on the list :). I like kate, shes real, and shes who she is. No matter what anybody says. Its inspiring....
Soo. I forgot everything iw as goign to say in this post. So maybe i will just end it soon. im excited to drive after school. I think im going to stay after for a little while not be in a huge rush. I hate leaving when everybody else is. Tasha's interesting, and really sweet.  I have to go to the bathroom. brb
Okay. So this weekend should be eventufl. Sometime over the whole weekend I have to clean nicks parents camp. I dont know when though. Blah yeah ill get paid but im not thrilled. Saturday should be fun though.. okay so now somethign got  me down so im just not going to writeanymore. Ill update again soon though.. love you all"

Name all of your friends (or the most important ones) and list these about each person: One word that describes them. What emotion they most often make you feel. If they were an animal, what and why. If they were a crayon, what color and why. Their best physical quality, their best non-physical quality. One memory about them that makes you smile. And if you could tell them anything, what would it be? 
--
nick-amazing,loved,dog.. because its my favorite animal, and hes my favorite. grey- because it just reminds me how much we have in common, and how he completes me. Everything, sexy boy, hmm but his beautiful face and all that goes along with that... hes so beautiful on the inside! all of them.. everyday is a new beautiful memory for us. I love him so much

  I hate hearing that what i am doing is wrong. That for some reason i'm not doing good enough. I try my fucking hardest. I used to not do that, I've come a long way. Compared to how things have gone in the past, I believe i have built my life up much more since then. I'm still learning, and i still havent accomplished a million different things i want to... but the fact of the matter is.. i'm trying. No one should ever  make someone feel as if they are lower then them. Of course we've all done it.. obviously every one of us. We all have faults. Ugh, sorry for all the blabbing. I just am really sick of doing my best, and not feeling appreciated for it. 
I love my dog, hes brilliant. Yes, anyway. 2nd driver test in about 2 weeks. Maybe sooner... yeah i know i should have passed the first time, i'm.. a good driver. Heh its something i actually mean.. i know how to drive. I really hope i pass, it will simplify a  few things. Now on to a job. To bad none of the places i applied to.. called me back.  All in good time, things will be figured out. I'm sure of it.. I signed up for classes. First time ever i was excited about school. I'm actually goign to take classes i want to take, ones that will maybe help out in the fields i might want to go to school for... all of which i have been thinking and debating constantly in my head. 
I apologize ahead of times, for my possible mood swings. As always, I try to keep them under control, but no matter how hard I try.. things slip up.
I'm glad im finding more friends, more people to relate to.(thank you kate)I can't emphasize enough how lonely I have felt not having friends. I had gotten other things straightened out.. but I was left with no one. I found myself, and my love (kiss) but i had no other people to vent to, to express to.. nobody to pat me on the shoulder and say.. i know just what you mean!!! Yep.

I have to much jumbling up in my head.. and i feel too sick. I need to lay down and fall asleep.. 

sleep: PLEASE JUST LET ME IN

dear any hypocritical ignorent assholes: I find it reasonable and honest to give you respect in your own right. Any person should have the ability to have opinions and express them... but i will never fucking go out of my way for you.. so that in the end you will ridicule me..and others who don't deserve it.  I have morals but i can also see the bad in people..I do not promote and will not provoke fake heartless people.

Kittens.. wow i cant wait until then are a little bigger.. i love them. ive never beeen around kittens or even cats because my dad hates them and im allergic. But at the shank house, i can play with all kinds of kitties! :) and now i get to keep one of them, and have it there. I  picked it out already, it was a tough decision cuz theres a nothe rone i really like but jordan likes it too, so she can have it :). i got the tailess one.. which a mustache and big eyes. hehehe  i think im going to name it boondock

and be comforted.. in the warmth of arms, the arms that belong to all the beauty in the world.

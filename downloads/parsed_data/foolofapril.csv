"event","I thought as I woke up @ 6am that today wouldn't go the way that I wanted it to...it turned out incredible to my surprise.

1) Woke Dave up...took a shower..he called me to see if I was up..and I was...he was the one I thought would fall back asleep...called me again to see if I had left...walked to the commuter rail station. I talked to him on the fone til I got there. He looked so cute from far away and was even more handsome as I got closer. He couldn't take his eyes off me..made me feel sexy..

2) Waited for the train for about 20 minutes..Dave ate a couple of the sandwiches that I made him..Got on the train...explained to him a little of what I was planning on showing him. Got off and found the red line train with ease...

3) Finally..got to Park Street....around like 8:30...he had to go to the bathroom which got me upset for some odd reason...had to go in mcdonalds..even though it was for customers only...talked to him and said let's not fight..and have a good day...

4) Walked through Boston Common...it was really beautiful...not to hot yet...Dave seemed to get distracted by the crazy people walking...sat down so dave could have another sandwich...I just loved walking with him...it was nice to have someone who wanted to hold my hand constantly.

5) Walked through the Public Gardens...decided we were gonna go on the Swan Boat...didn't open til 10 so we walked around some..sat down on a bench cuz he wanted to tell me how much I meant to him...he didn't want to give me a card..would rather talk to me from his heart I guess...almost made me cry...I really think we needed this day..to get away from everyone...ya know

6) Went on the Swan Boat....romantic...he seemed to like it a lot which made me happy...

7) Sat down yet again...we ate a sandwich and had a little break b4 going down Newbury St. Damn...Newbury St. is a bitch and a half. So damn long..well we were looking for a store...CONDOMWORLD...and it just happened to be like almost at the end of the street. By that time.. it was like 95 degrees out and we had to stop and get some drinks. 

8) Condomworld was pretty interesting...didn't have that much so all we got was 2 flavored condoms...promised myself that I would go back there.

9) Walked to Copley Place...love talking to him while we walked..he didn't complain once...I was so proud of him...I kept asking him if he was ok though...got to the mall..went through the whole thing just to get to the Cheesecake Factory.

10) Got some cheesecake..ate it outside..Dave was a little upset about how pricey the slices were...""We could have gotten this at Shaw's"" I told him that the whole point of going to Boston was to spend as much money as we could...he understood..once he tasted the cheesecake.

11)Went in a few stores...walked all the way back to Park St. and took the train to South Station..we got there around 2:30..so we had some time b4 the 3:10 train to Holbrook..Dave was looking mad tired..he put his head down on the table we were sitting at...almost missed our train too..had to run...we both looked so drained..

12) Decided that we didn't want the day to be ova..thought about going in the pool and the watching a movie...got rid of the movies idea cuz we really didn't have that much money..after some conflict with his mother..we got picked up around 3:30. 

13) Got our bathing suits at my house and went to his house...it took him forever to go in the pool cuz it was cold at first..finally got him in...i loved being in his arms...we had our little fun...**2x***Dave couldn't get ova it....got out...ate a delicious meal his mother prepared us.

14) Watched some tv...eventually fell asleep...woke up around....9ish..told Dave he should drive me home cuz we were both so tired...nah..didn't happen....had some more fun ******and then he finally drove me home..got home around 10:15.


I couldn't ask for a nicer day with some great weather..we both agreed on though that since today was so great that we know something bad will happen. It always does.... 
<marquee>All in all...the day brought us closer...and its been a wonderful 2 years!</marquee>"

<h2>Your bra is a SEXY bra!</h2>
Like you, your bra likes to titillate and tantalize.<br><br>
You like see through bra's, and in the right mood you might even wear one with the nipples cut out ;)<br><br>
Exploring the fine line between sexiness and slutty-ness is a favourite pastime of yours!<br><br>
Another favourite pastime is bending over to pick something up you dropped ""accidentally"" and making sure people (guys, girls, it's all good) get a chance to look down your top and admire how sexy your bra really is.<br><br>
Or more so, the package it encompasses....

"event","I hope all of my friends are doing well...I haven't talked to anymore and that really sucks. My life is pretty predictable: work...and help dave get his CDL license. And I still sit here on my ass in little old Holbrook not knowing what the fuck to do with my life. It really sucks....I have no drive to do anything. It just seems like there is nothing out there for me. The only thing I feel strongly about is helping Dave with his dreams. I don't want to necessarily want to say that Dave is a distraction...I don't know what it is.


If anyone has any advice...let me know...I miss you all.. If anyone wants to hang out im off tues and weds...


Love you all!"

"event","My eyes are burning from crying...It sucks...I can't sleep right now so I guess I'll write down my thoughts so I can tire myself out some how.

Tonite..was good. Work was ...well...work...Got outta work. Plans changed of course for Dave and I. We hung out a little bit and he dropped me off at my house at 1. It didn't end there. We ended up talking till 230am about everything possible. He got real serious when he was talking to me too which was a little scary becuz he rarely gets serious like that.

Dave started talking about all of his dreams for the future. He wants to have a house by the end of my college years. He figures he can get enough by working his ass off while I'm gone. He wishes I wasn't going so far to college but there is nothing he can do about it. ""Who will I mess with when you're gone?"", he asks me. That made me feel kind of sad. All he wants is to be happy which is what everyone wants. He got mad at me for disagreeing with him about the whole house thing. 

There were a few outbursts between the both of us. I cried a whole bunch of times. I'm such a wimp. It's pathetic. He told me he really wants to have a kid with me. He thinks that will make him happy. I told him he isn't financially prepared nor mature enough to handle the responsiblities of having a child. When I even decide to have a kid..we both need a steady job and a home. Toward the end of our conversation...he started staring into my eyes...dead serious..telling me that he wouldn't trade me for the world...he isn't going anywhere...he loves me more than I know. He started freaking me out in a weird way because it hit me completely that this guy is head ova heels in love with me. 

He told me that he had a crush on me for the longest time and even went out with a girl that looked similar to me to try and replace me some how but it didn't work. 

I wish people could see Dave for who is he. But I'm glad I get to be the lucky one to see all sides of him.

<marquee>""I know we both get aggrivated a lot at each other but I never could stay mad at you.""-Dave</marquee>

I honestly never thought this relationship would last this long..cuz ya know this is my first try. I love him to pieces. I really want to be with him. He told me that there is no one else better for him then me. 

He truly cares for me...and it feels pretty good. I mean I know things are never going to be perfect..trust me I've found that out for myself. When you look in someone's eyes and know that they want to spend the rest of their life with you...it makes you feel.........damn..there are no words to suscribe it.

<marquee>""I'm sorry that I don't open up that much ...I've been hurt my girls before.""-Dave</marquee>

My poor baby...I hope he knows I would <u>never hurt</u> him.....

I hate fighting with him...and sometimes I am such a bitch to him....


He told me I have so much more potential...then working at Walmart...He thinks I should do something involving the computer..I'm glad he believes in me. He wants me to have a job that I am happy about. Basically.. he doesn't want me working at WalMart for the rest of my life. He wants so much for his life and I keep telling him that I'm so proud that he has goals but he shouldn't rush his life away. There's so many things that I wish I didn't rush through.

I thought I would never be in love and when it finally happens, it is so strong I can barely control it.

It's pretty bad when I hear a song and just start full out crying about Dave. (Angel of Mine-Monica). 


All those years of complaining and the first guy I go out with wants to make me his wife. Damn...I must be very special.

People may have their own opinions about us. He doesn't support me finanically but he is my best friend and I love him with everything I have..


<b>I don't know if crying this much is a good thing or not.</b>

<marquee>""I would give you the world if I could.""-Dave</marquee>

I can't remember everything that was said but I think that was the most important part..

Sometimes I wonder if I should ever go to college. My love life is so great right now...but my social life sucks becuz everyone is gone. I don't even dance anymore...how sad is that shit...that makes me even more depressed. I was crazy about dance...I was even going to major in and I guess ever since my surgery ...my passion for it just vanished.


I hope everyone is doing well. It feels like I'm never going to see anyone..It sucks."

"event","It's been a little while since I updated this. I know so many people are dying to know what I'm up to. The sad fact is I bet no one even looks at this. What can you do?



It fucking sucks that all my school friends are all at school. And what am I doing...working and not gaining knowledge. The only thing that I am proud of that is that Dave and I have been going out for 19 months..It's such an accomplishment for me because he is my first boyfriend. He told me that if we break up there will be no other for him. It's weird...our lives are so different but we are so much alike...



I wish I could go back to June and relive my high school graduation...all my friends were there. That was one of the most emotional days of my life. I never really thought about this before but I was never so sad and happy at the same time. I regret letting that day fly by..I remember all I kept thinking about that I had to go to work after the ceremony. That day was so profound...damn...I wish I could go back to that. Anyone agree??? Help me out here...


Hmmm..I need to call Howard University..but I have no motivation...I promised myself the end of the month and it is steadily approaching..This sucks."

I'm so thrilled after I punch out from work...thinking how many more seconds i have to endure b4 I can lay in my bed..then when I eventually plop on my bed I have to hear constant yelling. It's getting to the point where it's like I don't want to even be at home. 
Life is a bitch.


Last nite was the WalMart Holiday Gathering..not too much fun. I won a prize...again. Last year I won a Gamecube and this year I got a dvd player..Works for me. Dave and I hung out for a couple of hours after leaving the party due to the fact that it was rather boring. We talked about a lot of things. I cried..about the stupidest things..He kept telling me that he wants no one else and that no one in this world is better than me. I'm just so worried that he we find someone better than me. He hates when I say that. He said I was perfect and no one is going to take him away from me.

<h2>Your Power Color Is Blue</h2>

If someone close to you is in pain, it makes you hurt as well.
You try to heal the ones you love with your kind and open heart.

<h2>This Could Last, But It Will Take Work!</h2>
You are good with relationships and good with communication. 

It's just your fear that holds you back. 

You are afraid of getting too serious, afraid of getting hurt, afraid of being afraid. 

You don't want to make the wrong choices, especially ones that could last forever, like marriage. 

This is ok for awhile. 

If you want a real relationship to last, you need to be completely open to it.

Good luck!

"event","Hey...boy it seems like I had the worst night possible...I fought with my best friend..we were both screaming at each other on the phone...never got in a fight like that..we were talking about if a girl cheats on her b/f. I said the b/f deserves to know everything no matter how much it will hurt. She said no woman should tell a guy that she played him. Just break up with him with the excuse of it not working out between them. My friend was just going to tell her b/f that it was not working out. She did that..but then called me and said that she fely so guilty that she was going to call him and tell him the truth. I was on the line when she told him. It was so hard for me to hear. She cried to me on the phone about what he said to her and all this stuff. Pretty hurtful words. She deserved it though. Then she started talking about how much she hates herself and how she doesn't want to be on the earth anymore. This started freaking me out. To be expected.
She put me on hold. When she finally came to back and I hate a male voice being cut off. I asked her who it was and she said it was her friend. Then, she started saying all these nice things to me, such as you have always been there for me and enjoy your life with your b/f and you have been such a great friend to me..this was fuckin scary. Then she said don't worry about me. Then there was silence. I kept saying hello and there was no reply.

I hung and said shes gonna hurt herself or even worse end her life. I can't let this happen. It was like one of those movies where the hurt girl calls her friends and tells them how much she loves them and then kills herself. I wasn't gonne let this happen. I called her back and she picked up the phone. I was balling my eyes out begging her not to do anything. That I needed her more she knows. Just trying to calm her down. After about 10 minutes of that..she stopped crying and I stopped crying...she called her other friend back and we talked on three way. We were trying to convince that everything will be all right. I know it was hard for her to hear. I felt so many emotions when she said if I hadn't called her back she really was going to do something to herself. That gave me such a weird feeling. Finally after a half an hour..she was back to laughing again.

What a night.....


I get to go see April this weekend. I'm happy."

"event","Boy does it feel weird staying in Holbrook while all of my friends venture off in various cities. 

If any of you guys aren't busy just call my cell phone. I don't want to bother you all cuz I figure you're busy with all that homework mess. I miss everyone of you.

If anyone cares here's the update on my situation:

The incision looks good. Nice long scar to look at. I went to the doctor last week and she said that I can't go back to work yet. That pissed me off just a little. She told me that the outside of me might be all healed up but the inside isn't . I have to go see her again in the middle of October. I still don't know what is up with the college thing. I still want to go, I just don't know when. My mother wants me to take some night classes. 

It seems as I'm getting more depressed as the days go along.
Oh ..here I go complaining!

Well.. hope to hear from everyone soon."

It sucks. 


You think the summer is gonna be a time for fun...and relaxing..but I'm getting extremely bored with my summer. The days just slip by and I can't do a thing about it. I want to get away...College is in August ...god that sucks in some way. 

I miss high school where I could see my friends...


Summer feels like a waste of time to me...

I'm not liking myself anymore. 

A year in and I already feel drained. That's a horrible feeling to have about the person who says they want to spent the rest of their life with you. 


I wish people wanted to hang out with me."

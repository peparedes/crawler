"event","What i want to know is why should i care...honestly seans right. It sucks...i'm trying to tell you...tommorow is gonna come as soon as 4 years now...weither its for the next couple months or until i graduate.  I'm always gonna be fighting...to try to get it to click in your head.  Right here waiting...for what...i have no idea.  To this day i don't know why you use too hold my hand and smile.  You always told me that I shouldn't listen to all the people and to jsut talk to you about us...and now when i think about it...i coulda saved myself so much pain if i just did listen to them.  But whats really sick...is that in the end...the one persons opinion i still want to here...yours...why...HA i have no fuckin idea and honestly i would love to jsut shoot myself in the foot about it.  So i'll go...not wanting to but i will...because all i wanted to here...was you to say you wanted me to stay...not for college...not for a degree...not for any of those shitty answers...i want you to want me to stay...for you...so i can finally show you what distance made you miss.  But i guess i'll never get that chance.  Tommorow is coming closer then we all think...and like i said either four years from now or a couple months i'll still be gone.  I'd just rather know what i used to have with you when i'm there instead of having it haunt me every morning i wake up...looking for an answer to a question only you can answer.

Look at me, my depth perception must be off again
Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did
It has not healed with time
It just shot down my spine
You look so beautiful tonight
Reminds me how you laid us down
And gently smiled before you destroyed my life

Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces
(let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces
(let me rest in pieces)
Pieces

<Insturmental>

Look at me, my depth perception must be off again
You got much closer than I thought you did
I am in your reach
You held me in your hands

Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces
(let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart
To make it go away
And let me rest in pieces
(let me rest in pieces)
<repeat x3>

Would you find it in your heart
To make this go away
And let me rest in pieces
(let me rest in pieces)
Would you find it in your heart

And let me rest in pieces

"event","In life decisions come.  Feelings i guess get in them.  What i wrote earlier.  Not to make someone look like horrible person.  If she was she wouldn't be in this profile in the first place cause i would have never wasted my time.  BUt like i said...It wasn't a waste of time.  I learned a lot from her.  It was just the end that sucked.  She's not a bad person and no one should ever think she is.  Shit happens.  Yea it's hard to say it cause i'm on the side who she let go of.  Can't say i never did it.  So don't think she's a horrible person.  She merely jsut had to move on...haven't we all done it.  Yea...i want to hate her when it all comes down to it but why don't i jsut look at it deeper...i was jsut tryign to express my feeling of how big a loss it was jsut because ya know what i thought love was...was everythingi  felt for her...yea it sucks to lsoe that but its not her fault.  I can't belive i'm saying this but i put myself in her shoes...i'd do the same thign eventually...in facti actually did it.  With Mel i broke up and less then a month later i was with christine.  Whatever...i just want to clear up the fact she's nto a bad person...yea it hurts...that's life i guess...i'll survive...jsut write now with getting ready to go home for break...all i wanted was everythign we had talked about..i was jsut too late and we are on two totally different paths.  So yea...i am happy for them.  It sucks to say it hahaha but yea.  Jsut trying to clear some shit up.  She's an amazing person and that entry was strickly on one action...it doesn't reflect who she is as a person.  Because...to me atleast...nevermind...
Just don't sit here and go strictly by my side...take both and just udnerstand in the end...she found someone to be there for her when she needed...not some guy 3 hours away home once a month.  She's finishing up high school...a time were she needs to jsut fuckin have fun...not get buckled down with some college army guy...i mean seriously who wants to dte a guy whose leaving in four years for war anyway...i didn't expect it to last anyway...in the back of my head gettign a taste of my own medicine was always there.  Just please...this journal is strictly to express emotions...love, pain, anger, whatever...don't think its the whole story or anything...think that ya know theres two sides...and she had every right to do what she did...it just sucks for one guy in the end...thats all...so no...she's not the devil...she's jsut like everyone else...a normal human being...learning from mistakes..............chuuuuu

"event","It's fine i guess...what's ever going from here...I keep telling myself your fine.  But it's messed up.  Just everything i've become the last couple of nights.  Can't believe i can't get over this.  My buds sit there say things like...your better off now, be able to move on with some one worth it, learned some things.  I won't let them say things like bitch, ho, or whatever...I don't knwo why cause i defiently want too..i wish i hated her...wish all this never happened...wish i could believe she was truelly sorry instead of being sarcastic as usual.  I think Manny put it best.  ""You gave her everything you could...you wanted to give her more but you told her you were in college and she knew that...she jsut chose to throw it back in your face like it meant nothing.  But in the end she mite of took everything...and you still love her...so you know you were honest and you were atleast real about and came out the better person.""  Everyone knows this got me so everyones just tryign to take me out but i gotta study for the finals.  As much as i'm trying to forget and move on...i just wish it was back to were i didn't know anything...i'd still get to here her voice before i fell asleep.  I'd be able to hope and think about what iw as gonna do for her next...but now i guess i just gotta laugh.  Chhhhhhuuu this sucks...it just feels so shady..the lies..when did they start...the lil she said i wish i could just believe it was real...i don't believe a damn word she says and me trusting people for awhile is like way the fuck out the door.  Just its jsut a buntch of fuckin bull shit cause i did it to myself get tangled up with a girl like that.  I learned...long distance sucks...love isn't real and if it was its a direct sign to get the fuck away as soon as possible...the once good thigns i thought i had are just lieing nightmares now.  Seeign her under a street light, first kiss at the football game, everything that made it seem like some fuckin dream...just all lies...it just hurts more then anything i ever felt.  like a constant weight on whatever the fuck is inside me...i feel sick...like i just dunno...lies?  wtf...I am turnign back to what i was but worse...looking for a temporary healing...alcohol or whatever...and thats scarry beign able to admit the fact i'm an alcoholic...Nisa and I had a good talk tonight...By the way sorry about gettign sick Babe haha...anyway just realized somethings...i realized how far i looked in to it...thinking i dunno...thinking allison was more then she was...cause in the end i just got lied to by just another chic...atleast that how Nisa put it.  So now my perspective is fucked up...for the first time someone actually cracked that one Justin ya'll know.  Left a permanent ""negative"" affect.  Usually i take the positive from everyone..instant forgiveness and straight up friends with you the first time i meet you...Totally different now...enemies everywhere...people out to fuck you over...trust is ridiculous idea and love is something people try to make themselves believe because they just want what they see in god damn movies.  And when all that shit actually happens...just makes it more deceiving.  I don't feel bad for myself..i learned stuff...can't love them ho's B...Jordian Ross...yea thats how it is...now i'm constantly on the look out...paranoid..constantly looking behind me...how ever you want to look at it...just not the same J i was before.  No longer the guy to provide advice to make you cheer up...this that permanent shit that just don't go away...life lesson.  So before you say I don't feel sorry for him just know this...i don;t want you to...cause i don;t either...i learned shit so i'm okay.  But before you go saying shit behind my back...take as much love as you could have for someone...take it...everything that makes you vulnerable to anything...give it all to that person..let 'em know...expose your weakness...then have that person act like she likes to here you say all that shit...walk in those shoes..a man who gave up any bad habits became totally loyal and came home on weekends missing weekends were he coulda made memories with his friends in college...but yet had no problem with that cause the false idea of love was the only thing in his head.  then as your at the highest level of feeling happy with that person...the last week or two were lies from her mouth...she was in someone elses arms and you had a general idea and listened to her lie to you over the phone...you try to make the tears silent so she doesn't know you know...then it ends...the one person who gave you a reason turns into a nightmare, enemy, or someone that jsut makes you feel like shit...it changes a man.  They say real men cry...i'll never again...just call me a ghost...don;t feel sorry for me cause i don't i learned what to do and that ain't trusting or loving it's just living...i gave into everything i was against...life is cruel and yea...i just figured it out...so take a walk in those shoes...realize how shady and shitty it was to do something like that and then try to continue with finals...realize why it hurts...then ya really mite know what it;s like...to be a dumb guy who thinks he's in love...when really just in love with some bullshit lie were nothing was real...Yea that's me now...but hey it happens right...we all move on...live and let die...just now a tough man cried, good man sinned...whatever...the sickest part is that inside...i wanna break out...Just what kills me is i have even shaken this kids hand thinking we were cool...just someone i knew...but i think everyone said it best after they saw me the other night...never get on my bad side...i dislike very few people in this world...just joined the list...but still i'm happy for 'em...who knows...it all ends up good somewhere down the road..i just want to graduate now and go overseas while being in the Army...it's all i got left...i need this war...that was that dream...she disappeared and then i started walking towards the war...well...here i come...anybodys son will do...i bluck my guitar barely...my left hand is swollen and i play a tune...a tune of understanding, hatred, sadness, joy, and heart ake...i looked for the best song...this one was it...so yet again i'm not asking for sympathy...just understand what it's like to be the good man inside that dies...and now your a just another mothers son filled with evil waiting to let loose...I'm now my own demon...and this is my song...for i have joined the group of normallity...who finallys got what lifes all about...and his wild sole...destroyed.....................

What it's Like - By: Everlast

We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change 
The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange 
He asks the man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes 
""Get a job you fucking slob,"" is all he replies 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues 

Then you really might know what it's like (what it;s like) 3x
Then you really might know what it's like 

Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love 
He said, ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll 
I'm the man you've been dreaming of."" 
But 3 months later he say he won't date her or return her calls 
And she swears, ""God damn, If find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls."" 
And then she heads for the clinic and 
she gets some static walking through the door 
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner 
and they call her a whore 
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 
'cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose 

Then you REALLY might know what its like (what its like) 3x
then you really might know what its like

I've seen a rich man beg 
I've seen a good man sin 
I've seen a tough man cry 
I've seen a loser win 
And a sad man grin 
I've heard an honest man lie 
I've seen the good side of bad 
And the downside of up 
And everything between 
I've licked the silver spoon 
Drank from the golden cup 
And smoked the finest green 
I've stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times 
before I broke their heart 
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start 

I knew this kid named Max 
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs 
He liked to hang out late 
he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs 
Until late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head 
He pulled out his chrome.45, talked some shit, and wound up dead 
Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain 
You know it comes that way 
at least that's what they say when you play the game 
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news 
'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose 

Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like... 
Then you really might know what it's like...to have the blues"

"event","So i officially am awake in the first hours of finals week.  It's abotu 2:47 and i just finished analyzing my sociology final.  Giving my opinion of why our society does what it does.  Male and Female roles in society and how i think it's a buntch of bullshit.  Someone taught me once that not all women grow up to want to be 2nd in the household.  Taught me she had a plan to be better then the rest by proving herself now.  Yea she taught me and i always enjoyed listening...oh well nevermind.  Anyway yea so in about 5 hours i gotta wake up and run over to Olscamp and turn this shit in.  It's been a rough weekend but it's not so bad.  Everyone said i should jsut cheer up and think of what stress i jsut got rid of.  It jsut wasn't that.  That shit was jsut attached to what people call emotions i guess thats why this was hard.  Anyway after i turn that in its back to bed then waking up and studying for government.  Hopefully that studying is a lot better.  Everyone is in their rooms studying.  It's crazy...never seen so many kids focussed on work in my life haha.  I dunno i guess i'm excited to come home for break too.  Get to see all my dudes and now i don't have to worry abotu were i put my time.  Three weeks!  I can get a lot done in three weeks haha wink wink knudge knudge.  My chill night with my lil sis Regina.  Remember babe the dress code is strictly PJ's.  Probably gonna end up at the Vue with Miz and Hunter.  Mike i'm gonna warn you.  Same feeling as last time we went before we left for college.  Let me clear my head first before we drop like 100 bucs.  Sean and JD...defiently hanging with those guys.  Hotel party i think is beign made for us returning college kids.  QUALITY INN! haha for one hell of a quality night.  Then probably blowing shit up with G-raham.  Definetly gonna have to hang out with all my girls from MND.  Lauren, Amy and friends.  Let's make the break good fellas.  Just straight chillin.  Nasty Natu style.

Swirl 360 ~Okay~
She sat me down and took me by the hand
She said I'll try to make this painless if I can
She was sorry and then she began to cry
Couldn't look me in the eye
I said baby let me just save you the time

I can see where this is going
Tears will fall and hearts will break
Loves a game we almost played
So dry your eyes and be on your way
As for me I'll be ok

Well I thought we were that perfect match
It's so hard to say that now without a laugh
There was never ever such a thing
Not as far as I can see
Now that all of love such misery

I'm used to it.  I knew it was a risk...Just wish i never met her.  Never felt this..never ever.  I hate everything about you now why do i still love you.  I'll make this go away in one way or the other.  You think it'll be the same.  Trust is gone, expressing anythign is gone, wake up again and realize that it always has to be about you.  Wake up and realize the guy who would have taken a bullet for you with no second thought isn't there.  Atleast i can die withotu a tear in my eye.  No more fear of whats after college now.  Thanks...the weight of the world is lifted.  You just braught back a man who was destined for failure...you gave a took hope.  He gave you his heart and you just broke it without a care in the world.  You think we can be friends like that.  we'll see...

My poems, essays, and presentations.  And in the midst of it all i kept thinking of the worst thing ever i could ever think of. I can lay down and kiss her picture knowing everythign is fine.  There's only one way to express why i worry so much.  I love her like crazy.  I was talkign jack tonight.  Asked him if he'd ever fallin in love before.  He said no...he said he defines love as being able to give your life up for someone.  I glanced down and thougth for a moment.  I woudl die for her...i lost my breath for a sec then came back.  Who knows...this is growing everyday and part of me wants it to stop because i'm so scarred that if it ends...how much this is going to hurt.  But, i can't think of that now...as every day comes i gotta think its one more day till i see her...I just want her to be thinking the same...hoping, praying...that this isn't a dream...i rest on every word she says...its why i worry or why i...i dunno...just scarred i guess...losing her is the nightmare i go thru everynight...if it ever became reality i dunno what i'd do.  Either way its time for bed...night folks...the semester is over...no more classes...just studying and three finals left...let's cross our fingers on this one fellas.  PEACE!

Closing my eyes on a world of Sunny days and making memories
To a land which is my mind in the shape of dark country side
Your there standying out in a red dress
The clouds turn grey and the rain is falling
I'm in a balck suite with the sounds of gun fire and war miles away
The forest is naked and dead
Everything is dark and everything expresses my pain
You are in the middle of the dark field...red dress, dirty blonde hair, and i can't miss your eyes
I begin to run...trying to reach for the dream within the nightmare
As we stare each other in the face...a single tear falls as your image faids away and once again i'm alone
This land, the tormented soul that no one see's
Nightmares of war and this dark field...the reality inside my mind...but thats it all in my head
I open my eyes to a new morning...once again hopeing the next night the rain that falls when i go to sleep just goes away
I get out of bed...get dressed and forget about it
Put on the smile...and when you call that night...i just act like everythings fine
No need for you to share in my pain...which brings the dark clouds...and rain

"event","Just re-read my autobiography essay for university success.  I realized something.  Haha no one has no fuckin idea why i do what i do...why i make certain decision...why i look at life the way i do.  Most people would see it and be like wow this dudes nuts.  They follow the croud.  Their scarred of emotions.  Emotions is what make you alive for fucks sake.  Anger, Happiness, Love, Pain, Broken Heart...anyone who just chooses not to recognize them is missing out on life.  Enjoy life and all it gives you back.  Your walking thru the snow alone on a beautiful day...the snow is falling...it makes you think of someone you care about.  Smiel for fucks sake...thats an emotion...call them or write them...just let it out.  Hiding it only makes it bottle up and then when it finally explodes nothing but negative energy comes out.  I dunno why i decided to write about this today but i'm getting sick and tired of fucks who are just hiding from small emotions.  If your angry...tell the dude who angered you.  If your in love...tell the person you love.  Someone broke your heart...tell the person who broke your heart.  Not that hard.  In the end ya feel better and for once people will see you for your true self.  The friends you haev will be true friends.  People need to stop smiling when there upset...acting like a dic when really they like the person...and fuckin need to stop holding back anger when initializing the problem is the first step to solving it.  Who knows whats up in the end of all this shit we call life.  I like to think while we are here on earth take every risk possible.  I'd rather live life reclassly then tip toe thru life just to arrive safely at death.  It's about taking chances.  Tell someone you love them even though you know they won't say it back.  And even if it hurts...atleast you said it and people know what your about.  Stop starring life in the face and bakcing away.  Tackle it head on and have a badass time.  Don't sit there and think after college your just another warm body at the office.  Your a fuckin individual.  Take pride in your right to fuckin live.  Go bungee jumping, cliff diving, sky diving, hang gliding, get a tatoo or a piercing, do something that will make you feel alive.  If not your just here waiting to die.  Take control...make yourself feel at peace.  Find a place that will do it.  Mine...being at st. peters in vatican city, Italy.  I want to go back so bad.  The weight of the world was lifted when I had penance there.  My other place of peace is in her arms.  I fear losing that place of peace.  But hey...that's living.  So for now i'm out i said my 5 cents on life and its back to a paper on U.S. Counter-Terrorism.  PEACE!

"event","Just sitting here in the dorm on a friday night waiting for it to unfold.  Everyone is tired of studyign and the fall semester is about to come to a close.  It's that hoiday season and so much has happened this past fall.  Obviously finishing it all off with my broken ass hand.  I dunno it seemed like a rough ride.  Not smooth.  I keep lieing to myself abotu not worrying about home.  If i could stay here it be better.  This is kind of my new family.  I live with them and everything.  Home is something else.  Just isn't like here.  The only good memory i have of home ar ethe nights were i get smashed with miz or watch football with sean.  But the one night that tops them all.  That would have to be the night i asked allison out.  My dream is for her to look me in the eyes again like she did that night.  This is harder then i thought being away.  Especially during the holiday season.  Who knows...Ihope everythign is going good back home.  I don't know i hardly get to talk to talk to her anymore...not like we used to.  Oh well...i'm sure it will all come around...hopefully.  This christmas season for some reason is jsut strictly about one thing for me.  ""Love""  .  I want to make everythign work out.  I want to make allison happy.  Prove to my folks that college is going good.  Show my bro his older brother is a badass haha.  I hate seeing the couples around campus and then look to my side and have no one there.  Tim's always with kate and i just think of allison.  Same with Matt and Meg.  I miss her so much.  I just don't liek tot alk about it anymore because the lonliness is mroe tehn the good memories.  I'm away more then i am with her.  Hopefully this break brings us closer together.  I don't know what i'd do if it just got worse.  So i sit here with my broken hand...contemplating what to do.  After break it's tiem for ROTC.  I just hope i can make her see...the better side of me.  I just want to walk with someone in the snow.  Wrapped around my arm beign able to share the adventures of my day with.  The phone no longer rings anymore, no more IM's...and i write a letter thinking it won't do anything anyway.  Is this hopeless or not.  I don't know what is to become of anything...all i know is that tonight i shall sit down with a beer in my good hand and make memories with my friends wishing she was here to make them with me.  Falling in love is something all young people should avoid.  It just punches you in the mouth at one point.  But sometimes it picks you up from other the other shit in life that knocked you down.  Who knows...i'm just here having no idea whats to come next.  And yea...i'm terrified...i just choose not to show it anymore.

Justin

P.S. All i want is to see you smile while we walk in the snow."

Straight up...i miss al...didn't want to...don't knwo why i jsut didn't want to.  But i do...more then i did last time i was here at BG.  I can't keep this from growing.  I don't knwo if this is bad or good, safe or not, happy or sad...i just don't know.  Frankly...i miss her...cause even if were fighting i still miss her...still love her...still everything i said abotu her when i first met her.

"event","Breaks over.  Means it's time to party again at college.  Finals...definetly got my mind wrapped around the importance of studying once i get back.  Ain't gonna lie...got woke up to a buntch of shit that i needed to have my eyes opened up to while i was back home.  Something about beign here just got me thinking and finally getting answers.  I know what i must do.  I smilin about it to.  Army...it's def gonna be numero uno now.  Studies...taking second place.  Special relationships(Allison)...gotta work on it to make this long distance thing work.  BUt i am gonna not focus on it that much jsut cause i think too much about it...analyze shit to much...missing the good shit.  I don't think it's hard cause were different, or it's three hours, or anythign like that...it's the attention...i love givign her attention...but i realize...i need it to because it makes it easier to be 3 hrs. away...if not...Who knows...as long as she's in my life...no way i can't be smilin.  So those are my top three.  Friends is a given.  Don't need to even mention...cause you know i'm mr. social.  Gotta cut back on the drinkin cause its jsut gonna break me down.  So here i say this:

I'm leaving, be back in three weeks for xmas break.  It happens...relationships...love the person no matter what.  two things ya gotta look at when its hard.  Is it making it stronger...or...a sign.  Anyway...i'm good now...much needed break.  If you know me.  I'm confident, strong, free spirited...thats without a weakness...now i got a weakness...i doubt myself...i'm good now tho...thanks for breaks...thanks for thinkign shit out...now i'm ready to party again with my dudes and ladies from BGSU.  No worries...I love all my friends, my family, especially allison.  Now that it's all figured out...someone pore me a bud hahaha  SEE YA LATER CINCY!  BE BACK IN THREE WEEKS!

"event","So i finally got one of these Live Journals. Pritty cool i guess.  Just a place for me to clear my head and share the stories of my life with my buds.  So let's see what happened today.  Well i came home last night from school for Thanksgiving break.  Awesome i guess...it seemed everyone was excited to see me.  Just frustrated right now but i'm okay.  Finals are coming...i want to do good but i know its gonna be hard.  Being a boyfriend again is crazy.  haha forgot what its like.  It's awesome though to come home and see her.  Allison just makes me forget about all the other shit thats out there.  I just feel i ain't doing the same for her thats all.  The sense of failure has definetly already set in.  I dunno what i'd do if i lost her.  Probably just drop out of school and enlist haha.  Oh yea!  can't wait for Army ROTC to start next semester.  Gonna be crazy.  but its worth all of it.  I'm so split right now in life haha...College is one giant party but when its time to work it sucks.  But its what ya gotta do to get somewhere in this world so why not.  Anyway i'm crashing so i guess that's it for the first entry.  You all stay classy now! haha

"event","Well it's good to be back home.  I dunno passing into West Chester on I-75 i just got a weird feeling in my stomach.  Just feel like eather something real bad or real good or maybe both is going to happen over break.  It feels like fucking Laguna beach around here.  Random hook ups, surprises, and drunken nights were the truth is expossed.  So then after passing rave and remembering all the good times in the DUB C i merged onto 275 remembering getting pulled over multiple times and me and graham making faces at people on the way home when we got fired from ""jACK OF ALL GAMES"" for doing donuts in the parking lot.  I passed I-71 one and if i looked to my right it was the way downtown were many baseball games have been viewed by me and sean...not to mention it was the way to the BIG MOE...and umm...to my left was Mason...yea...her face to mind...anyway..continued into Loveland and I felt at home.  This place is full of so many memories.  CRashing my car..OUCH! umm working at 20 mile steak house...Moeller i guess...the girls...haha mike getting arrested...i dunno it may seem like bad things but it made us who we are today.  I know i firmly stand by the fact that i don't regret anything because i learn from everything.  But for some reason i got a crazy feeling about this break.  So we'll see what happens.  Just wish coming home woudl be a little different then it is.  I just hope none of us go to jail hahaha and for some reason i'm getting that gut feeling haha.  Weither its beating someones ass, DUI, drunk in public...anything i just rather go home with no additions to my record.  I mean for fucks sakes i jsut ran from the cops up at BGSU on saturday.  And tim...stop getting drunk and telling what you and kate do behind closed doors hahaha.   So yea i'm out this break is gonna be nuts...but hey...that moe'05 for you.  Peace i'm out


J to the BIZ

P.S.  What did you want when i looked left...for me to smile or have that same tear fall...this time in sadness instead of joy..."

"event","right now,  its basically poker weed circus frisbee. thats the pattern and it would be much better if school wasnt in there. its not even that school is so bad right no, i have good teachers good classes and im doing well so i dont really have that much reason to complain. i guess i just dont like the concept of school, id just rather not go. maybe its just cause i know that theres so much more to life than high school. i just wish it would end sooner. 2 years seems like a long time from now. its not that hard or anything, its just a big chunk of my day stolen away from me. i think its not as bad as i really think. i just have too much to do.

tomorrow im going to Ringling Bro circus and the next night to Cirque du Soleil and the next night more poker. Sounds fun but its the same old pattern. Maybe i need to realize that its always going to be the same pattern. or maybe thats bullshit."

coffehouse was a lot of fun last weekend. i know it's old news but o well. all the bands sounded really fucking good, they were on fire...except the craters. and the juggling went well too, especially because e came up with the order and stuff as we were going on. a lot of people said i did a really good job which was cool. 

jay peak is gonna be so much fun. i cant wait, except for the six hour bus ride. ugh.

well vacation is good, i feel like its way too short though. i mean we need more than 1 week to be out of that shit hole they call education. i mean every day in school i feel like dying more than shuffling on to my next class, we need more than one fucking week away from that. honestly school is just a bad place. it trakes up so much fucking time, i hate it, i hate it i hate it. i think the problem with north is that a lot more people suck and a lot less people are very interesting than at csw. and i never hear about any shows and never have time toget out of this wasteland of a city. i havent gone into boston or cambridge for so long wich is really weird seeing as how i basically live there in the summer. eh whatever, were almost halfway through he schoolyear. i cant believe ive spen however many nomths its been since september wasting my time in school. its been way too long since ive seen any of my friends from csw. i gotta get out of this place and just go somewhere awesome. im going to new york on thursday and friday which should be fun, but im going with my family which is ok. im gonna get a unicycle though whcich is ill. maybe on new years something interesting will go down.

after school i hung out with some ill kids who i hadnt hug out before and colin gave me some more dreads. then i got thai food with colin and his dad which was awesome.

i think im starting to get backcrosses down pretty well, same with flashing triples and continuos flourishes. i finally learned burkes barrage this weekend. nnhs juggling club had a little performance on sunday which im looking forward to. ive got juggling club tomorrow at bu and thursday at north, which is sweet. im getting good at diablo too, i can do suicides and go around my leg really well.

im feeling more happy about things now. i mean school still sucks and it really sucks because my shit got stolen but im not letting school get int the way of other things, except for that it takes a lot o time.

theres this awesome camp this summer. its a travelling trip by the same base camp as the traveling theater camp i did last summer. but this one is going to be a circus about the AIDs epidemic and its traveling in south africa. i really hope i can go, because it will be so awesome, and some of the stuff you do is fire eating which i really want to learn. the only thing is it costs 4000 dollars. but im going to get a job, babysit my ass off and ask all my relatives and close family friends if thye can help at least a little bit. i really hope it works out cuz it just would be so perfect."

i feel like im pretty mellow and i dont get stressed out too much but sometimes shit just keeps building up and it really sucks. today i was pulling out all the shit that was broken in my bag and doing my homework and stuff kept falling apart, and then my mom sprayed water in my window when she was watering the garden and i just couldnt understand my math work and it was all happening at once and i just wanted to scream and shit. like, usually i dont get that stressed out but with all the school stuff that i get now and all the time school takes up i have such little time to just relax and do nothing. and i spend most of that time juggling. like it feels like shit to have all my time scheduled for me and to have everything i have to do dictated to me by someone else. i fucking hate it. but i more or less decided to just finish school for the fuck of it and i guess thats the shit ill have to deal with if i do.

and it wouldnt be so bad if i had just a little more time to myself or if i could find some other thing to do where i can just not have a care in the world. thats what i miss about summer."

"event","so school is alright. its big and crazy and theres no fresh air. but other than that its pretty fun. and classes arent too bad. i think ive decided to finish school and even go to college. like it really sucks, but i thiink i wanna finish just for the hell of it. its not as though ill ever use my diplma for anything but i might as well just finish. 

so i really need a new bike. mine is a piece of shit. ive fixed it up as much as i possibly can but it still creaks and wobbles and yeah you get the idea. but bikes are so fucking expensive. we found one for 440 today that is really nice. im not gonna get a school bus pass, im gonna put the money towards a bike, and try to get a job. hopefully ill be able to get in a month or two but i kind of doubt it. maybe it wont suck so much when my dad starts his job.

juggling club was awesome today. i learned some more tricks for passing clubs. i can now pass and catch doubes out of both hands and triples out of the right hand. and i can pick up a dropped club without stopping the pattern. i cant wait for the north juggling club to start."

"event","im so fucking sick of presidents and all that stupid ineffective representation. how can anyone expect everybody in the USA to be represented by one person. sure sure ou get to vote and choose who you like best but face it, the only way for people to really be represented is if they represent themselves directly. especially right now, i mean bush and kerrey, all your choosing between is a personality. their polcies are the same!! and even if they had different policies what if you disagree with both, then your not represented. it is absolutely impossible for everyone in such a huge country to be represented. we need to form small communities in which everyone has an equal say and gets to directly state their views rather than choosing the person who they hate the least. face it, local government just doesnt work the way it should. we have to stop trying to fix the problems in this system and start a new one. according to the constitution it is the peoples right to abolish the government and create a new one when the current government becomes destructive. i dont see how anyone can argue that this system has not become destructive. so lets reclaim our freedom and start a new system."

"event","i think im a huge dork. i count the days until the next juggling club meeting. o well, i dont mind.

its so sad observing my mom. her schedule is always the same. eat sleep eat work...repeat. i mean, its cool that she works at the childrens museum and she does good things, working to smash stereotypes about native americans, but its scary how her work becomes her life. shes either at work or at home, working.  her free time is practically nonexistent. i finally figured out why she likes going to maine. because its the only vacation she gets, the only time she doesnt have to work. i never got that because for me, at least in the summer, my whole life is vacation, going to maine just takes me away from my friends, but for her its the only time she has to relax. so she watches tv. its fucking pathetic. and this i guess is typical. and its about to happen to my dad too, now that hes got a job. i swear ill never gt like that. ill never be chained to any office or stuck indoors all day and not even know if it was nice out. no wonder shes overweight. no wonder all of america is overweight. because its expected to sit at a desk all day. and then come home to eat and watch tv before going to sleep.

ill never get like that. ill keep every moment of my life to be mine, not some office's. i wont try to make a living out of anything, i wont exploit my talents like that. ill make what i do into my living. you can live without money and without a home. theres food everywhere and shelter everywhere. why buy food and waste more material when you can get it for free and save food from behind the store in the dumpster. why buy or build a house when theres plenty that are abandoned and plenty other places to stay. all a permanant house does is keep you trapped inside. thatll never happen to me."

"event","its really weird to clean/rearrange your room. i did today and now part of my room is totally different. its really odd. 

im excited to go to camp on saturday and its gonna be really fun. but i wish i was just staying around here also. or actually, i wish i didnt have to go to maine right after. then things would be much less hactic and much simpler and much easier. maybe ill find a waiy not to go.

i feel so weird, and i dontt know why. maybe ive done too much thinking today. or maybe its cuz its the longest day of the year. or maybe its cuz i went to sleep at 6 in the morning today.

the one person i need to talk to isnt there, and hasnt been for a while. maybe/hopefully tomorrow they will be

i dont know why i wrote this post. maybe i just have nothing better to do. sorry if you read this and it was stupid."

"event","fuckin sucks when your mom reads your journal thinking its school stuff, which certainly cant be the truth, and finds out you smoked a lot of pot after graduation after you told her you stopped after you got in trouble before and still had felt like shit since then and now its even worse. only now shes convinced you have a problem and thinks your ""throwing your life away"" and wants to do everything she can think of to ""help you stop"" even though you dont regularly do it anyways. and it sucks when every fucking vacation you get from being trapped in a school you get in a shitload of trouble and get trapped at home with people you cant stand being with. yeah it really fucking sucks when your parents even mention the idea of calling the police on you if you do it again so you know even if you did want to you cant, and theres nothing at all you can do about it.

i went to the park and just swung on the swings and walked around with my friend which was pretty fun, then i went shopping with my parents for food at wilson farm, in lexington, it was fun. we drove by this crazy morman temple in belmont, it was super creepy. it had this really scary vibe and everything around just seemed so dead andit was such an ugly building. all the flowers were bent over and wilting and stuff and all the trees, which werent trees that normally do this, had their branches hanging down and the grass was all dying and the bushes looked so weird, almost sad or lonely."

"event","I definitely haven't posted on this lovely website in a long time. It's fun to visit once in a while, look at my past, relive thoughts, etc. 

Here's an update in my life. I'm a fifth year here at school. I finally made it, and I'm graduating in less than 3 months. It's exciting and scary and unbelievable all at the same time. 

As for recent times, I've been living in this house 8 miles south of Irvine in a city called Lake Forest. I have my own room still, but the owner of the house is pretty strict. She won't allow overnight guests so it's tough even to just have my sister visit me. She also stopped me from using a personal heater because those machines breaches her ""fire insurance."" In retrospect I guess her regulations make sense. Guests aren't allowed probably cause it's kind of awkward to have them, and personal heaters do pose a threat to the safety of the house. In the end though, I think she just doesn't want to deal with the extra costs that come with both situations. She's this cute Vietnamese lady who used to own a bunch of nail salons before she retired. She gives me fruits from her backyard and sometimes cooks me dinner. All in all I'm not complaining.

I also had to tell my parents that I am gay. Excuse me, that I like men (because apparently I don't act like a gay guy. How is a gay guy supposed to act? That's for another post). Anyways, times are already pretty shaky without having to come out what with graduation and the job search and really planning for the rest of my life. My parents are also going through some crappy times what with the house remodeling that's taking more than a year to do. Nevertheless, I don't have regrets on my part. The only regret that I have is that it wasn't as positive as I had hoped for. It wasn't all that bad, I mean my parents still talk to me and I am welcome to come home whenever I want. They do request that I try not to keep girlfriends out of my life, but even that will be hard to come by (especially after reading my previous post). Thanks to all my friends in advance for all your support. I definitely am aware that it will take a long time before my parents can finally accept who I am, but it's ok. Normality and homeostasis in families especially in America is relative, and time will only tell. 

I still have the same car. I've been wearing the same clothes for the past year. I still have a majority of my closest friends by my side. I look the same but I definitely don't feel the same. In a sense, I feel as though a part of me died. I'm being emo here. It's hard to describe. I don't have that same spark that I used to have. It could of been the drinking/drugs, all the times I was screwed over literally and figuratively, and just experiencing life. I guess that's what's part of growing up is that you ""mature"" emotionally. Or maybe I'm just purely heartless now. I'm taking Janelle to a lot of places because my mom and dad are kind of old for that stuff and they look more and more tired as time passes. But even when we do crazy cool things, I am not impressed too much. I mean Lord knows my family is not poor, but we're not rich either. I really don't understand why emotionally feel burned out, but that's OK too. 

Nevertheless, coming out, doing really well in school, and getting so close to graduation has really upped the confidence that I have for myself. I'm not afraid to voice out my opinion to anyone, even if it's my research adviser, my friends, or my parents, even if I can't articulate it well. I'm improving the way I talk and I can explain things much better than before. I admit there are still some situations when blah-blahs come out of my mouth, but it's not as frequent as before. It's a continuing process, and now that I'm aware that I can be confident, I catch myself being excessively modest. Plus I can stand up straight now. Jeez, I can't believe how long my posture has been like that but damn, hunching over for years can have a really bad effect on physical appearance and self-esteem!

Aside from a few inconveniences, life is treating me relatively well. I went home last week for a couple days, and my parents are still goofy, my sister is still sassy, and I feel quite happy. I see potential for a bright future, and I have a lot of dreams that I want to accomplish before I die, which is hopefully a long ass time from now. I can also be thankful for all of you who can put up with my bullshit, flakiness, and conceit. But of course there were the times that we had loads of fun, and I can assure you that there will be more of that in store. I love you all and may God bless you.

Until next time..."

"event","What is with me putting up with the bullshit that cocky, stuck-up, selfish bastards who don't give a fuck about me. Mind you, I haven't involved myself (nor had sex) with anyone for almost a year now, but puhlease. I'm so scarred that I don't think I really want to do even just one innocent date. EVER.

I'm tired of guys who just talk about themselves or ask for pity or don't consider your ideas to be conducive to theirs. I'm sorry if I'm a great listener. I'm sorry if I am not as witty as you. I'm sorry for putting up with your bullshit, waiting like a little house-dog for his master to come back home to play with him. 

A friend of mine put it well: ""You like assholes who don't treat you well."" Why? And when they aren't assholes (I'm going to be blunt and superficial) they are ugly or boring.

Fuck relationships, fuck dating. Getting to know another guy is a waste of time especially when they're just going to stomp on my heart. I'm not a perfect guy...by any means. I'm kind of wishy washy. I don't know how to communicate sometimes. I have ADD with family, friends, and everyone else. But GODDAMNIT, I'm worth it, and you better know it.

I gave my all to these men. I wanted more than a lay. Apparently what I wanted didn't matter because I couldn't express it well enough. Too bad...too bad. 

Yes, too bad because I'm stomping my foot down, and I'm keeping it there. I'm taking a stand against you fuckers. It's pretty clear that I can't handle you because you obviously can't handle me. I don't care if I'm going to be single forever. I just don't want to waste my money, time, and whole, sane self to someone who just wouldn't give a flying fuck anyways.

"event","SO I have to say that Friday was an interesting day (yay for rhymes!)

Apart from having $150 stolen from my checking account (the perps bought themselves drinks and tacos LOL...) I got to see somethign I thought I'd never see in a million years...or at least my entire life.

MY friends and I were walking out of the parking garage in West Hollywood, a kind of gay-mecca, but it can't really compare to SF or other locales world-wide. Anyways we were right at the entrance to the parking lot which lies adjacent to a busy street. My friend looks at me and says....

...""ARE they having sex? Oh my God...""

<IMG SRC=""http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f152/kuyajason/outreaching%2011-16-07/P1010002.jpg"">

So immediately after the initial feeling of shock, I started to feel sad. I mean just a half hour ago, I was outreaching and collecting sexual health surveys trying to promote safe sex practices while handing out condoms outside the bars. And then you see this happening, you just feel like you aren't doing enough. But I took a picture anyways, and that turned my frown upside down. A random guy was walking back to his car and he kept loudly expressing ""UGH!"" But I bet they were too drugged up to hear. I ran further back and took another shot, a little darker, but you can see important details...

My two friends were way closer, and they just kept watching in horor and amusement. A group of people were walking towards the parking lot this time. 

<IMG SRC=""http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f152/kuyajason/outreaching%2011-16-07/WTF.jpg"">

My friend said, ""Everyone look! They're having sex!""

They kind of stopped after at least 10 full minutes of powerthrusting. I thought they were done, and I felt kind of embarassed just watching these two people with their pants down, I think the guy was holding his junk. BUT NO they weren't done. My friend said, ""I think he's making her give him a blowjob!!!"" OMG...

When my friends came back up to me, they told me that it wasn't two guys...

IT WAS A STRAIGHT COUPLE! (Look at the last pic, the person in front is wearing knee-length boots, and unless you're a drag queen, you won't find a gay guy wearing knee-length boots who's also trying to get some ass that night)

I mean come on! I know gay guys are completly promiscuous, but just cause we are doesn't mean we don't have class! I mean, at least hide the damn bushes!!! They were standing right outside the parking lot entrance in the middle of a busy street. But it was something fun to watch I guess... LOLZ ABOUND ...so please, striaght people everywhere: Don't go to the gay meccas just to have street sex. GET A ROOM! EVEN A BATHROOM ! JEEZ...

And just in case you're interested, here's the <A HREF=""http://s47.photobucket.com/albums/f152/kuyajason/outreaching%2011-16-07/"" TARGET=_blank>rest of pics that night...</A>"

"event","It seems as though people say there's something specific you have to do in order to be truly happy. Maybe not even say, but just by doing, when everyone's doing the same thing around you, you feel like ""Oh, that's got to be the only way...

I roll out of bed alone, I eat alone, I take walks at the park alone, I get lost alone, I drive to places alone, I study alone, I watch movies alone, I go to church alone, and I fall asleep alone. It seems very lonely. There are times when I think, ""This would feel a lot better if I am with someone."" There's also the ones out there who I falsely believe are people I can ""spend my entire life with forever,"" only to find out that ""forever"" lasts under 20 weeks. 

Call me jaded. Tell me ""You just haven't met the right one."" 

I didn't really sleep well last night, or for the past 4 nights at that, but I went to church today and despite my tiredness, I prayed in m y heart. I realized that I had an epiphany: I am happy. I've never been this happy for as long as I can remember. I feel so free and independent. My feelings don't rely on another's happiness, and to me, another person's happiness is just as important as my own. But the commitment and responsibility to that aspect of life that I have with my friends is just as fluid as my own contentment. For me, it feels so much easier to not have to constantly work to make one feel happy, especially after I had just upset that person since we would have an intimate relationship.

Call me selfish, call me ignorant.

A while ago I visited my friend in Fairfield, she was having  a big birthday dinner with her close and extended family and friends. Everyone was having such a good time, dancing, singing, a typical filipino party. Even the grandmas had these wide smiles on their face. I can imagine what they felt like, all their children and grandchildren together, celebrating, life is good. The last of my four grandparents passed away on June of this year. I can also imagine how she felt towards the end of her life. 

Before 2 years ago she had been joyful, resilient despite the drama that was happening on my Mom's side of the family, all the infidelity, anonimity, in-fighting, and estranged-ness that was going on at the time. Then she broke her arm. She suddenly got sick, she would just spend hours sleeping in front of the TV. She barely spoke except when she would say ""Ha?"" several times. It's like she just gave up. Then the typhoon struck, and the whole roof was ripped from the house. She lived for a few months after the renovation, but she must of felt so lonely. Her only daughter lives in another country, her two sons constantly trying to find solace in other women, all her grandchildren either far from her or unsuccessful. I felt sorrow for her and regret that I did not get to see my lola alive, but I really did feel pity for her too...I digress...

ANYWAYS, I can't remember the last time my family was like my friend's from Fairfield. Maybe when I was 6, before all this drama happend everywhere. We haven't had such a large family party since I turned 12. I feel kind of disconnected from my extended relatives, since most are so far apart, others are caught up in their other lives, and some ... are ...well, let's just say shit didn't turn out right for them. I'm not saying that I am who I am entirely because of my past, but I think that it would of helped to have a more intimate family who expresses these intimacies freely, and it would of also helped if there was less drama amongst the relatives...

But anyways, all the weird things that happend in my life, I feel like it influenced me a lot to feel this contentment in solitude. I just hope that I can realize that this is my happiness. I mean, after all, happiness is relative, and all it takes for me to be happy when I'm down in the dumps, is that all I need is myself to get myself back up on my feet."

"event","<lj-cut text=""An excerpt from my textbook""> ""Nitrosamines are present in many foods, especially cured meats and smoked fish, and they are also found in tobacco smoke, alcoholic beverages, and cosmetics. Nitrosamines cause many forms of cancer.

Nitrosamines can be formed when amines that occur naturally in food react with sodium nitrite, NaNO2, a preservative added to meats such as ham, bacon, and hot dogs to inhibit the growth of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>, a bacterium responsible for a lethal form of food poisoning. Nitrosamines may also be formed in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract when bacteria in the body vonvert nitrates into nitrites which then react with amines...

The use of sodium nitrite as a preservative is a classic example of the often delicate balance between risk and benefit. On the one hand, there is an enormous benefit in reducing the prevalence of fatal toxins in meats by the addition of sodium nitrite. On the other, there is the added risk that sodium nitrite may increase the level of nitrosamines in certain foods. Nitrites are still used as food additives, but the allowable level of nitrites in curred meats has been reduced.""</lj-cut>

MAN...everything in this world causes cancer. What the hell. Even your own body makes the cancer, not from genes, just thru processes. Oh well."

OKAYokay, it's not that groundbreaking. But I saw Event Horizon, and um, that was a weird movie. But this kills it. For all the genres of movies I've seen, I have benchmarks. WWII can't top Saving Private Ryan, and Gladiator totally dominates my historical movies list (Alexander? PLEASE). This movie is my no.1 of the movies pertaining to space travel/enivornmental destruction/sci fi/thriller. Sorry ""Day After Tomorrow (Oh Jakey)"" and ""Space Odyssey."" SUNSHINE beats all of you.

All this realization after watching NOMAD (the warrior)...yes the actual title includes parenthesis as if Kazakhs needed to define what a Nomad is. Poor Jay Hernandez. Actually, I just think it's weird that a Mexican Actor was cast as the National Hero of Kazakhstan. Eh, Borat was funnier anyways.

"event","I'm having one of those days. You know, those days where everything sucks no matter how bright the sun is shining. In reality, while life plays out, everything is going well, but emotionally, you just don't feel driven to be happy. I hope this is what a normal person goes through, otherwise I feel like I need to see a therapist.

I haven't felt like this in a while. I feel like nothing is going my way, and it is selfish, but I want things to go my way all the time. Come to think, I look back and I realize that the no. 1 reason why I feel so crappy about life sometimes is that maybe I have too many high expectations. Optimism doesn't hurt right? But it's useless when a lot of the expectations get thrown out the door. 

Kids are so naive. And this isn't a bad thing either. As a kid, my memories are full of how life is so amazing, magical, undeniably true and real. People and animals and plants and everything is alive for a special purpose. Life makes things that could easily be still and unmoving into animated and, well, lively things that change the world and help one another and proliferate and enjoy life. 

Then kids mature. They live, and while they do, they grow, they get taunted, they taunt, they learn pride, misery, abuse, love, hate, jealousy, greed, sorrow, disorder, entropy. War, peace, famine, abundance, sex, rape, truth, falsities, religion, death, pain. All these emotions, all this chaos. Objects are living because of a bunch of biochemical signals. Survival of the fittest. Economy based on the theory of supply and demand. Physics and motion as a series of mathematical equations. History repeating itself over and over and over. Life is so tedious.

I just watched Equilibrium, a 2002 movie that barely anyone's heard of. It's got pre-The Machinist Christian Bale, who is a hottie. Anyways...the movie takes place in a Orwelian/Brave-New-Worldish civilization which is enclosed from the war-torn outside world, but is an oasis of totalitarianism regulated by monotony and emotion-suppresing drug use. It's pretty lame for me to say, but I think that movie made me think that maybe the purpose of living is to live and experience all these emotions no matter what. Maybe it's my skewed way of thinking in this country which upholds individualism and personal (potential, and restrained)liberty, but look: if people really cared for each other they'd be helping one another every day all the time regardless of class race age health looks...nothing else seems to be a better point to live than to feel. 

So I rant, but it's part of life, and I feel like life sucks, but that's cause I live to feel. Thank goodness for self therapy!"

My family lives in the filipino ghetto in LA, except that the city moved 400 miles north to Vallejo. LIfe's rough, there's a lot of crime and for some reason the garbage collectors never come by. A gay filipino mobster named Inday chases me around to be his/her lover. Meanwhile my family discovers I'm gay and I run away.

The 5th floor guy I noticed to be one of the dudes from my BME classes. A tall lanky asian guy I knew by face but not by name, so there was some kind of awkward feeling going on.

A minute after I first got on we reached the 5th floor. The bell dings, and the doors start to open, but then they stopped. They opened up an inch gap but the bme guy could not get out. ""Um..."" he said. We both were pushing the buttons for 5th floor and ""Door open"" but nothing happend. He stuck his hand out in the gap and tried to pry it open to no avail. I started to think that the elevator cable would snap and then we'd be hurtling to our death.

The doors slammed shut. We stood there in this fear-awkward mix of emotion. Then I hit the 5th floor button again and the doors opened as usual. He got out, ""Alright...thanks."" I waved him off, and I got off on the 6th floor.

My dad was a preschool teacher for 4 year old boys. I don't know where mom and sister were, but anyhow there was a war raging in some distant land, probably south america or the middle east, and they needed recruits. Somehow, I was a veteran, and the country even enlisted the kids from my dad's class. We were all in the same unit. Most of the battles I can remember took place at night, kind of like if you saw ""Flags of Our Fathers."" We were always crouched to the ground, with our massive automatic rifles. All we wore were turtleneck shirts and berets. One by one I'd see the young kids get taken down by oddly shaped projectile...as if the enemy were tossing axes and scythes instead of bullets. The weapons came down and sliced my prepubescent comrads in half tall-ways side-ways...all ways. Sometimes when the object hit them, it would peel their skin off. But I guess it wasn't a realistic kind of peeling off, because their skin came off as if a candle was melting. All I could do was stare in horror. At one point the opposing side threw a large curved metal object at me, luckily it fell short a few feet and i took one of the smaller objects that killed someone on my unit and hit him. I was breathing profusely with fear oozing into my blood....
...Suddenly I was in my living room playing a video game that resembled Super Mario World (scrolling adventure game) with an ultraviolent version of GTA San Andreas. The whole game I had to avoid Martial Law that took over a city whilst its citizens were running amok in a riotous rage. After I was massacred, I went to the downstairs floor where my dad taught his class. Many of his students didn't make it. What amazed me the most was looking down at the floor and seeing the kids who did. I just saw them kill people and here they were sitting as if nothing really happend. Some had injuries, but it was mostly superficial. The ones who got the brunt of the violence were finished off in the battlefield. The kids were staring at me, and I was staring at my dad. I went over to my dad and I just hugged him and started sobbing, and he was comforting me. I've never done that ever to him...probably when i was 6 or something, but not when I was an adult. He said, ""It's ok. Don't let mom know...""
Later on I tried to talk to my friends, but it was as if they didn't care about the shit I went through in the war. One would talk about a bad relationship. I finally understood why soldiers do not divulge to their close friends what happend when they were on a mission.
Then I woke up."

So last night, I was at the Senses Fail Concert in San Francisco, and lead singer Buddy Nielsen explained that he hated Rosie O' Donnel. I was thinking that he just didn't like angry lesbian comedians. The rest of the audience, me and janelle both wondered why he brought up something like that, so our reaction was a kind of confused silence...maybe it was because we were so tired from wildin out. Everyone was covered in sweat from the moshing, alas I digress...after seeing that vid up there, I am starting to lean to the punk singer's point of view. 

Sure, everyone is angry at Rosie, but I don't think I heard nervous laughter from the ""View"" members and the audience. I think they all enjoyed such a derogatory joke. So maybe the anger of society should be focused on the audience, or more correctly, on itself for being so hypocritical. Perhaps people are just blowing up what was supposed to be a small situation. It's just a joke right? It's all relative. 

Eh, who likes Rosie anyways?"

Anyways, it's the last day of school for many universities on the quarter system, and I'm sure at the final lecture before the exam, everyone's been through at least one class where the entire class clapped at the prof/lecturer. Ever since the end of my first quarter, I've been wondering why? Sure, it's out of respect. But sometimes, I just feel like some prof's don't deserve it. Personally, I do applaud those I felt were very helpful. For all the other 'research-oriented' mind-borers whose lazy lecture style induced what was supposed to be an inciteful dialogue into kindergarten school naptime, I just get up and leave. 

I do take pleasure in walking out of the last lecture of a class where close to no one claps. After all, <i>we</i> are the ones paying for their salaries. The very least I could do to help them out with their careers is to give them adequate survey comments, and apt attention.

Time for finals."

"event","I have a new series of posts to ...uh...well post. I call it ""What the F_word"" Moments. These moments are times I experienced massive amounts of shame and anger, but did nothing about it which in turn makes me look/feel like a big, flabby, cellulite covered ass. And without further ado:

This past sunday mom, sister and I ate dimsum at the restaurant that is inside what used to be Lido supermarket. YOu know, the grocery store in newark that sold frogs (it's 99 Ranch now, and yes they still sell frogs). 

After lunch we went to the store to run some errands. 

What the F_Word Moment 1:
Janelle and I were staring at the bullfrogs. We walked back to look for my mom at the produce section, who was holding a jug of milk in one hand, and choosing bananas with the other. When she saw us, she dropped the jug onto the floor which spilled all over. I stood there and covered my mouth in shock and stupidity. We looked around, and the mexican guy working at the produce section looked at us, smiled and said ""what happend??"" he then walked away. Some asian guy who was pushing a cart took two empty boxes and placed them ontop of the spill-zone. The three of us walked away. As we were standing in line at the checkout counter, a really angry man was speaking heatedly in an East-Asian language walked past us. He was being followed by a poor employee. We left the store without getting any reciprocity for our ""sin"".

What the F_word Moment 2:
As we walked out of the store, someone honked a blow-horn loudly. Some asian people standing on the curb looked annoyingly to whoever was behind us, but I ignored it. Then they honked again. I looked back. Two teenagers wearing their north face puff-jackets and black A's caps were walking hautily passed us and kept blowing one of those sports horns people use at graduations. They were simply doing it cause they were bored. I on the other hand was furious. I wanted to run back to the car and drive up to them really fast and honk at them, but shame and apathy took hold. My mom laughed it off and said, ""That's the future of America."" Agreed."

"event","Parents gave me a zune. It didn't sell well when it came out, and for good reason too. I didn't like the ipod/itunes interface. I HATe the zune setup. It's all wanabe. I spent 4 hours trying to configure the stupid windows setup at home. I had to update windows 4 freaking times. Finally I got songs on the player, and I know all this stupid work is useless cause all the songs are going to erase when I go back to my apartment and computer in Irvine. The biggest downside to this expensive piece of crap is that I cant even use it as an external hardrive without doing some useless tweeking to it. I really did want an MP3 player, but not something as complicated as the ZUNE. It ain't worth the $250 dollars. One day I'll sell it for $50 or something, and get me a nice and simple mp3 player with out all this flash bang-ness of picture movie wifi brouhaha. All I need is something to listen to music. If you are a techno fashionista, I suggest you stray far away from this stupid thing. As for me, there's only one dogma I abide by in these times of unecessary annoyance...

"event","Of course I was procrastinating today, but maybe it's not so stalkerish. Anyhow...

I was bored out of my mind trying to figure out some stupid math problem. So I did that thing where I went on the University Webpage and looked for people who have my name on campus. Not just ""Jason,"" but ""Andrew Jason"". So Surprisingly enough, I came across 8 total Andrew Jasons of some sort of combo (To be more precise, 7 Jason Andrews and 1 other Andrew Jason). How scarey that anyone as lowly as myself can have the access to such personal info so readily no? So what's the next thing a bored college student such as myself would do with other random college student's email? to FACEBOOK THEM of course! LOL. 

I went a-searching for who would have a profile, and a couple were duds; one dude had a profile but hadn't updated it since facebook began. Several of them came up with interesting results:

<b>Jason Andrew(1)</b> is currently a first year who lives in Mesa Court and hails from FREMONT.

<b>Jason Andrew (2)</b> is a bit older, but was born a year minus 2 days after me, and is from San Jose. He also has an affinity for the Simpsons.

<b>Jason Andrew (3)</b> is bi, acording to his ""interested in"" section, but could be as a result of him not knowing how facebook works with sexual orientation (lol). However, he did post pictures of him galavanting in Laguna Beach with a group mostly composed of females, which boosts his chances of being gay significantly.

<b>Jason Andrew (4)</b> has a love of Adult Swim.

<b>Jason Andrew (5)</b> is also from Northern California (If you say that Monteray is in that region too...) and was born a month before me.

<b>Jason Andrew (6)</b> has nothing in common with me cause he's a frat guy from SAE.

Finally there was only one other guy with the same arrangement that I had, and apparently <b>Andrew Jason (2)</b> didn't have a facebook page. Shame, I could of easily stalked and analyzed his page for similarities with myself, to boost my ego of course.

Until next time..."

"event","Today started pretty blah with an 1.5 hour class at 8 am. I fell asleep a couple of times. After class I decided to crash in the Science Library when I suddenly remembered that I had to go schedule an appointment at the Department of Engineering Student Affairs at the dilapidated trailers on the other side of campus. After a long boring walk across the park, I got to the secretary's desk. He's a white guy with red hair, probably in his mid 40's and was pretty short around my height. He talked with a slight lisp, and didn't wear a wedding ring, which according to my estimates makes him about 60% gay. 

I just walked through the glass doors when he stopped what he was doing (Shuffling papers or whatever) and stared at me intently. I told him my need to have an appointment with a counselor (if I didn't get one by 6th week, my winter registration would be put on a hold). He explained that I could only get an appointment then and there with a Robin Alward. So I waited until the petite spunky 60 something lady with permed hair called me in...

Robin: Hi how are ya?
Me: Uh...Hi. I'm ma ma good.. I'm good.
Robin: Ha?
M: I'm good. And yourself?
R: I'm, ahhh, tired. I'm just tired. <i>She rubs her face with her hands</i> What's your shirt say?
M: Uh, well...It's just a bunch of jibberish, I don't really know what it means! <i>Laughter</i>
R: Oh? Well...what's it mean?
M: I don't know, maybe something to do with Adam and Eve.
R: Well I think it's funny. <i>Laughter</i> Where'd you get it?
M: At Hollister.
R: What were you doing all the way over there?
M: Oh no! Not the town that's in the middle of no where...it's a clothing store
R: Oh, yeah, you know where it's at? In the middle of Garlic Country. <i>looks at my academic record summary</i> So...it looks like you've had a good summer!
M: <i>Thinks it's a statement about my summer-school success, and doesn't realize it's a general statement about summer break</i> Oh! Well, not really...
R: Oh? What'd you do?
M: I worked at a clothing store. Kind of encouraged me not to mess up this time around.
R: Yeah cause you don't wanna end up there right? With all the customers! You know, you just wanna tell them, ""Go find it yourself!"" And they're all messy...they're so, so...so uncouthe!
M: Yeah <i>Laughter</i>

So then she asked me where I worked, and when I told her it was in Milpitas, she explained that she was half raised in Newport Beach and half raised in Walnut Creek/Irvington when her parents split and talked about being a ""wild girl [sic]"" at the beach...

R: So what can we say about this...
M: I really, uh, hate to make excuses but...<i> explains to her the story about get everything stolen</i> So yeah that kind of ...I had a hard time ... and then I had a final the next day!
R: Oh that's horrible! Well you learn something new...do you put on sunscreen?
M: <i>Shocked at the total randomness, so takes it lightly...</i> Ah, haha, yeah all the time!
R: <i>Smiles</i> I bet ya don't.
M: Oh I try...
R: Well, I'm serious about it! <i>looks intently</i> My brother died this summer. Yeah, melanoma. And it was deep skin too. Didn't have a clue. Not one clue!
M: Ohhh, not until like the final moments..
R: Yeah, four months. It's really sad.
M: Yeah
R: I'm really serious when I tell ya that. I was just in Austrailia the past winter, and you know? There's a hole in the Ozone...over Australia and New Zealand. And the the the young people are dying over there. Just sad. It's serious!
M: Oh that's really bad. Yeah I  hear you. You know just across the street they have a tanning salon...
R: <i>Shakes head in disapproval</i> Oh no...Yup the sun it's deadly. You need to tell your friends... You know what kind of sunscreen to get?
M: Yeah I do.
R: Yeah? But you gotta look at the ingredients.
M: Oh yeah, Zinc Oxide?
R: Zinc Oxide and Titanium dioxide. <i>Pulls out magazine clipping</i>
M: Ohh...
R: <i>Starts writing two post its, one for me and my friends and the other for her</i> Yeah tell your friends! So life lessons learned: Don't bring your stuff to the beach, and...
M: Put sunscreen.
R: Yeah, so...I guess you know what to do <i>looks at academic summary</i>. I mean, not much more to say about this.
M: Yeah I'm definately not going to mess up this time. Well I better not!
R: Yeah, so well when you have any questions or concerns, or happiness, or life, just drop by and...
M: Okay! Sure thing. Thanks a lot.
R: Sure, take care, bye.

Can you believe it. My academic future at UCI depended on a conversation on Fremont and Sunscreen.

...

So yeah, wear sunscreen."

It was after lunch today, and the family was watching some TV. Everyone was in a good mood except for me. I had told myself that I was going to finally enroll for my summer school today. The catch was I had to enroll in TWO instead of the orignal ONE class, since I had a D+ in my biostatistics class. The other major drawback was that the total cost would come to be around $1080. That's almost the same amount that got stolen from me when I went to the beach!

We were all watching ""Behind the Da Vinci Code"" on the History Channel, and my mom finally came out of the bathroom after being in there for an unholy amount of time, while dad passed out on the couch as a result of having a food coma. She then began writing up checks for her Macy's card. I was waiting for her to get done, but I had to take my sister to the dentist in thirty minutes. So I took a deep breath and I prepared for what was to come...

me: Mom can I enroll in my Summer School now?
mom: O! Oh yeah, here's the card...
me: Well, I'm planning on taking two classes now...
mom: WHAT? ANO?! <i>Hindi ka nag passa nanaman ah?</i>
me: No, I passed...
mom: Then why two classes? You didn't pass ha? 
me: ... 
mom: Ha?
me: ...no I passed. 
mom: <i>Naku kang bata ka!</i> How come I've never seen your grades.
Suddenly dad wakes up
dad: Haa......ano......where are your grades?
me: ...
mom: YOU KNOW THIS whole time you've been in UCI I haven't ONCE seen your grades.
dad: ...
me: ...well...uh...
Mom then continuously persists that I show her my grades.
dad: WELL HE'S GOING TO BRING JANELLE TO THE DENTIST. <i> MALELATE SILA!</i>
They argue for a bit, then Janelle steps out of the stairway ready to be driven to her appointment. I got up and left and my mom gave me the checks I had to pay at Macy's since she was going to her work in an hour. ""We'll talk later."" I quickly walk out of the house. Janelle says ""Bye."" 

I tried my best to prolong my time outside of the house since I didn't want to be around my dad. Her appointment was done and we went to the mall to pay off the macy's card. Then we shopped for 3 hours. We got back home, and I totally forgot that dad wanted me to set something up with him in the backyard. It didn't matter now cause he was sound asleep in his bedroom. He had a night shift to attend to at San Jose International. So I sulked around the house and played video games with my sister. 

Then mom called from the hospital and continued to push me for what happend with my grades:
Mom: What happend huh? You can tell me. How come you haven't shown us your grades? What class do you have to retake this time.
After some contemplation I decided to give up the lie and just give in.
me: I got a D+
mom: <i>Naku talaga...</i> What class was it?
me: biostatistics
After some profanities, she exclaimed to me how it was ridiculous that I failed in biostats. Then came the standard parental lecture on how I was wasting their money, and I was wasting my own time. She told me how I was having too much <i>Gud Taym</i> and that I had to be on lock down. No work, no beach, no friends. Of course I didn't inerrupt her in her speil
mom: Are you listening?
me: yeah...
I was actually listening to my voicemail and watching TV at the same time, in order to numb my reaction to her ranting.
She went on to offer her credit card number. By that time I was past down in the dumps. I felt as though I was at the bottom of the dumpster buried under a meter thick layer of garbage.

Later that night I laid in the couch. Janelle kept saying ""EAT KUYA!"" I made a loud moan in reply. ""You know you're going to get over it..."" She warmed some food up and prepared it on the table for me. It wasn't enough. By the time I was done I ate enough food for 5 people, and now I sit here.

This whole D+ business is bothering me to the point of depression. It's just what I do. I let things get to me like this. If I didn't, then how would I learn the lesson? It's obsessive, I know, since it's psychologically debilitating. But it's not only this situation. I force myself to think about the past. And honestly, I've been putting myself into some pretty shitty conditions as this year drags on and on. Being near the source of my sorrow isn't helping. I really want to just hide in my apartment down in Irvine again. 

I do enjoy the time I'm spending with my sister. She's my only solace in these crappy times. We talk about things that other people wouldn't understand...like how amusing commercial jingles are so we sing them to each other.

Ben, my boyfriend constantly tells me that he loves me and misses me so dearly. I feel required to miss him too. But the feeling doesn't really come up. I kind of don't miss him. I love him though. I feel so guilty as a result. I see good looking guys on pictures and on the street and I get turned on. Then there's my poor boyfriend just thinking about me. Isn't that conceited or selfish at the very least? What am I to do...I'm stuck with that whole dillema of me not being able to appreciate my relationship again. I'm blaming the situation with my school with the amount of time that I dedicate with volunteering and my friends, and unbeknownst to my parents, my relationship. I just want to lock myself away from everyone and everything...why????

I haven't been hanging out with you guys as much. It's kind of part to do with being away from my family for so long, and part because I'm so afraid of how times changed so much. Especially to my friends in the bay area, things are different huh? The original crew was so big, but because of drama, school, and shear geographical distances, our bonds have weakend if not broken. I'll admit that I don't want to have to choose. I'm already at home, and I miss my sister when I'm away, so I just opt to stick around here. Sigh...but such is the nature of times. Old friends drift apart and strangers become homies. There's opportunity for all of us to be tight again, but you do have to admit that it won't be the same as it used to. I'll try to suck it in and be content with what we got.

But WHEN will this SHIT END!??!"

XmanofmanyhatsX: agreed.  
XmanofmanyhatsX: i'm only second rate compared to him
Mr JT Laughter: Yeah, it's just too bad.
Mr JT Laughter: You could have been great.
XmanofmanyhatsX: *sighs* i had big dreams you know.....
XmanofmanyhatsX: lmao
XmanofmanyhatsX: jk
XmanofmanyhatsX: you caught me in a somewhat good mood
Mr JT Laughter: Alert the media.

Mr JT Laughter: Didn't think so.
Mr JT Laughter: You know, you should try Mr. Windex. He can get you a lot more giggly.
Mr JT Laughter: Or maybe Mrs. Windex.
Mr JT Laughter: But if you mess around with Mrs. Windex, Mr. Windex will come after you, and we don't want that happening, do we, Jay?
XmanofmanyhatsX: i've heard that windex solves all pain.......
Mr JT Laughter: Hmm. Why don't you go try it?

Mr JT Laughter: No, but I'm sure you're rolling on the floor already, aren't you?
XmanofmanyhatsX: you're slipping.....*frowns* i think you've just been degraded back to mr.clean
Mr JT Laughter: No, I don't think so. 
Mr JT Laughter: I'm not being mean. The talking toilet really should get out, and you're just the one to show him the sweet life.
XmanofmanyhatsX: so is mr. clean moron
Mr JT Laughter: Mr. Clean is wild enough, young man.
XmanofmanyhatsX: ...but now he's missing!!!!
Mr JT Laughter: And keep this on the DL, but I hear that HE messes around with the Swiffer Lady.
Mr JT Laughter: That's probably where he is.
XmanofmanyhatsX: ooooooo.....scandals!!!
Mr JT Laughter: Maybe she killed him. I heard that the Swiffer Lady found him with the Pine-Sol lady AND Mrs. Windex... and get this... Mrs. Butterworth was there, too!
XmanofmanyhatsX: aaahhhh...no love for aunt jehmima???  or betty crocker???
XmanofmanyhatsX: wait...are we branching into foods now???
Mr JT Laughter: No, but that's what makes it so messed up, don't you see?
Mr JT Laughter: It's like that guy who messed around with a monkey and gave everyone AIDS.
Mr JT Laughter: Who knows what diseases the toilet supplies will give the kitchen!?
XmanofmanyhatsX: jt!!!!  dont' tell everyone what you do in your spare time!!
Mr JT Laughter: You know, you're quite witty when you're drunk
Mr JT Laughter: .
XmanofmanyhatsX: what you and toby do in your free time is NONE of my business
Mr JT Laughter: Okay, okay, I admit, Toby WAS with a monkey once. But I at least limit myself to closer primates.
XmanofmanyhatsX: i knew it
XmanofmanyhatsX: you, him and liberty all that freaky ass threesome and now we're all infected
XmanofmanyhatsX: i should make my peace w/the swiffer lady before i die
Mr JT Laughter: You really should.
XmanofmanyhatsX: maybe i could hire her to dance at my funeral or around my grave.....
XmanofmanyhatsX: hhhhmmmmmm.......
Mr JT Laughter: But you'll end up getting her pregnant, Jay, and that will cause such disarray in the toilet community.
XmanofmanyhatsX: i'd be dead!!!!
XmanofmanyhatsX: swiffer isn't toilet community dumbass
Mr JT Laughter: The cleaning supply community, then. I beg your pardon.
XmanofmanyhatsX: what do you bed of my pardon???  it's interested.....
Mr JT Laughter: If you ask me, the talking toilet is the one you need to make peace with.
XmanofmanyhatsX: already paid my homage to the porcelein gods thank you
Mr JT Laughter: I didn't need to hear that.
XmanofmanyhatsX: hear what??
XmanofmanyhatsX: i'm confused.......
Mr JT Laughter: Well, that didn't take much.
XmanofmanyhatsX: hey!!!

Mr JT Laughter: You know your babies are going to look like a bunch of boiled shrimp.
Mr JT Laughter: That's even worse than monkeys.
Mr JT Laughter: Shame, shame.

XmanofmanyhatsX: it tastes good.
Mr JT Laughter: You eat babies, too?
XmanofmanyhatsX: wiat....that would mean that i would eat my kids!!!
XmanofmanyhatsX: nnooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mr JT Laughter: Jay, I recommend you see a counselor and/or join a support group immeadiately.
XmanofmanyhatsX: ((haha....random thought.  have you ever seen clone high??))
Mr JT Laughter: ((LOL no))
XmanofmanyhatsX: ((ooohhh....nm then.  it was awesome...that reminded me of a episode.  sorry))
XmanofmanyhatsX: for oompa loompa lovers??
Mr JT Laughter: ((LOL))
Mr JT Laughter: No, for parents who eat their children. It's not healthy for society.
XmanofmanyhatsX: or swiffer lady lovers???
XmanofmanyhatsX: i won't eat my kids!!  esp if they're like boiled shrimp...that shit's nasty
Mr JT Laughter: All of Swiffer Lady's lovers could start a national database, rathe than a support group.
Mr JT Laughter: I thought you liked shrimp...?
XmanofmanyhatsX: ...not boiled shrimp!!!
Mr JT Laughter: Mmhmm.
XmanofmanyhatsX: we should start the database!
Mr JT Laughter: Yes, I think we should.
Mr JT Laughter: But be warned- Toby has also been with the Swiffer Lady. There's no telling what diseases you might have now.
XmanofmanyhatsX: aw shit
XmanofmanyhatsX: i have to get tested again.  *sigh*  mrs. buttersworth wasn't too happy w/me last time.....
Mr JT Laughter: And what did you have last time?
XmanofmanyhatsX: syrup poisoning
Mr JT Laughter: I hear that's deadly.

Mr JT Laughter: Well, I would love to continue this intellectually stimulating conversation, Jay, but unfortunately it's time for me to go to bed like the wimp I am.
XmanofmanyhatsX: i think someone's knocking on my door....hhhmmmm....
XmanofmanyhatsX: good because i have to go
Mr JT Laughter: Don't drink too much.
XmanofmanyhatsX: and if i find mr. clean i'll send him home

"event","alright so first things first....went over to ellie's the other night with alex.  that was special.  found out a/b her tounge ring...that was funny.  and she said sean didnt' know a/b it; bet he does now!!!  lol.  her room is a complete disaster area.....made me feel at home.  lmao.  then alex found a picture of us and called her a stalker so now ellie is my stalker.  i dunno if i should feel cool and pleased or freaked out and wierd.  eh *shrugs* oh well.  and el, i'm sorry a/b your mom.  that sux;know first hand.  

and then talked to darcy, that new girl in grade 9, and we hung out a little bit.  she's pretty cool...or she seems to be.  she's trying to branch out of herself; whatever that shit means.  lol.  but she didn't get why i got upset a/b her walking at night.  i don't even like it when alex walks at night adn i know lex can hold her own.  but yeah.  it was...interesting i guess you could say.  but yeah..that's what's going on in the life of jay at the moment.  such excitement.  whatever...going to bed now."

"event","aaannnnndddd i hate degrassi.  wow that's such a shock.  i hate homework, i hate the friggen lemmings we have there and i hate how everyone thinks that we're such badass motherfuckers.  oh wait...i like that part.  heh.  so jay's looking for a job right now....who's hiring???  

and yeah talking to ellie the other night...what a joyous event.  not.  i was half drunk out of my mind and she was being sort of bitchy.  no offense el.  i mean i know she's your friend and all alex, but seriously.  that girl needs to loosen up some.  we had a nice little chat about our parents and then i brought up her little ""hobby"" and she spazzed out on me and left.  whatever...sorry for caring.

look, i'm bored as hell so someone give me a call so we can do something.

"event","I've been working on Thesis since 9:30 yesterday morning. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. And I'm still in a history meeting conference. <br />And yet I really find my thesis interesting. I'm enjoying the challenge of completing my proposal. I didn't think I'd enjoy thesis this much considering my rocky start to the semester. Hopefully <em>hopefully</em> Ma'am approves.<br />There's a painful kind of happiness in doing something that you love.<br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

"event","You know, I'm a pretty stable person. Despite my unusual tendencies to pinch people whenever I feel like it, spontaneously utter incoherent words, and my affinity to communicate through yelling, I'm a pretty stable human being. I don't do drugs, I don't use alcohol to escape reality, and I don't carry around a blood stained cutter in my bag for &quot;emo moments&quot;. I feel generally well adjusted to life and all it brought down on me; I consider myself happy 95 percent of the time despite the fact that I sometimes keep myself so busy that I'm stressed half the time. Life seemed good, from a general point of view. Yesterday though, when Ma'am Sol totally creamed me for my apparent lack of talent at reading her mind, I went at a downward spiral. I was seriously so unhappy that I was sinfully unproductive the rest of the day. Isn't that pathetic?<br /><br />Yes, it was totally self inflicted since I totally brought this on myself. That was on the back of my mind the whole effing time yesterday and yet, I couldn't help but continue to kick myself in the ass (Mentally of course. This is still unfortunately physically impossible). After a few hours of wallowing in uselessness, a spark of revelatiion finally stung me. Today, after spending a few hours studying for theology, I realized that I've been living a life worshipping a false god called Anxiety. Anxiety in the fear that I should get back on my top form when it comes to schoolwork as soon as possible so that I can finally have a moment to relax. This made me realize that the only reason I'm not where I want to be right now is because of my unintended Machiavellian thinking. Oh shame. <br /><br />It is a wonder that I've not felt at ease lately. The jitteriness that accompanies me when I try to finish a paper is a sign from Anxiety, telling me to hurry along up so I can get to work on the next paper. Where is the joy in wanting to read something new for class because it's so interesing? Where is the excitement at attending a new philosophy class? Where did my love for&nbsp; learning go? What made me so happy to learn and do schoolwork before has now left me in a state of perpetual inconsequence. I must get it back.<br /><br />Here's to screwing the Anxiety god.<br /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

Crap.

I don't want to be a Senior! I hate the feeling that school will end in one year&nbsp; (although i know that that is semi untrue for me as i plan to take a fifth year but still! The feeling is still the same). Why is this happening? I'm sad. I don't want college to end. I want to&nbsp; stay in school foreeeeeeever.

"event","I planned to ignore this but since I've been tagged by so many people already that I would feel unbelievably rude if i continued to ignore it.
One of the main reasons why I planned to ignore this is because I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE NOTES IN FACEBOOK AND AM TOO LAZY TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT NOW. But once I figure it out, I swear to all those lovely taggers that I will import this blog entry to facebook.

Scouts honor.

Here's to Sam, Ching, Chris, Aziel, Nyx, Migz, Robin, Roberta, Ryan and whoever else bandwagon-ed me.

 Rules: Once you've been tagged, you are supposed to write a note with 25 random things, facts, habits, or goals about you. At the end, choose 25 people to be tagged. You have to tag the person who tagged you. If I tagged you, it's because I want to know more about you.
 
1.) I don't really have &quot;goals in life&quot;. I used to make them but found that they tied me down a lot so I stopped. I just take things a day at a time right now.

2.) I don't cram schoolwork. I always do things in advance. I've had that habit since gradeschool.

3.) I have a thing for keys. Not the modern ugly-and-sometimes-colored ones but the really rustic medieval looking ones. I have a medieval looking key as a key to my room right now and I just want to keep it with me foreeever.

4.) I used to have a stamp collection.

5.) I used to read the Bible everyday when I was like 11. And I read the Children's Bible several times.

6.) I've loved swimming and the sea for as long as I can remember. I feel that it's the closest I can get to actually flying.

7.) I used to write a lot of poetry when I was younger. I still do write but not as much.

8.) I spent my late grade school and early highschool days reading Reader's Digest. I now love reading Newsweek.

9.) I've been correcting people's grammar since I was in gradeschool. 

10.) I used to be the biggest bully ever when I was in gradeschool. I could get away with MURDER. The teachers there loved me. 

11.) I used to believe that if I wasn't forced to take ballet, singing, and painting lessons that I'd actually really like them and maybe even have gotten into them.

12.) I love being weird, weird people, and weird things. I find weirdness so interesting.

13.) I hate liars. I feel that lying is the highest form of disrespect towards a person albeit's done with good intentions.

14.) I love babies. I used to work in an orphanage the summer before first year college and I try to visit the orphanage for Christmas every year after that.

15.) My comfort foods are wheatbread with crumpy, pancit canton, bolognese spaghetti, and pizza. (How appropriate that all my comfort foods aren't healthy- with the exception of the wheatbread- considering how health-freakish I am right now) 

16.) I'm lactose intolerant. This usually doesn't bother me since I don't drink milk in the Philippines. But then I discovered FULL&nbsp;CREAM&nbsp;EUROPEAN&nbsp;MILK and am now having milk with cereal (caramel flavored) almost every morning for breakfast.

17.) I make funny noises for no reason sometimes.

18.) I honestly enjoyed almost every class I've ever taken in Ateneo (with the obvious exception of SA). I greatly admire most of the teachers I've studied under. I think Ma'am Sol, Fr.&nbsp;Dacanay, Sir Chua, and Sir Lozada are truly excellent teachers. If I ever become a philologist, teacher, or researcher, I would like to have as much passion for my work as Ma'am Sol has for hers.

19.) I used to love going out to parties and stuff in highschool but now I've become more of a homebody (CURSE YOU, ATENEO WORKLOAD!) and I honestly don't mind. 

20.) I see my room as my own private sanctuary.

21.) I have adjustment issues. That's one of the main reasons I went to Belgium.

22.) I LOVE eating pizza crusts with pepsi. I used to even dip the crust in my glass of pepsi and then eat it (like how most people dip their oreos in milk). I also like eating chocolate and mocha cake with milk though I just keep the cake in my mouth and drink milk at the same time ( though i rarely do that anymore).

23.) I co-wrote a batch song that our batch in zobel loved but didn't win. My friend and I wrote used to write songs for people back then.

24.) I used to dream of becoming a scientist- specifically a geneticist. I might have, actually, if I didn't hate chemistry so much. I also dreamed of becoming a doctor but now I realize that if i ever fulfill that dream that I'd want to become a homeopathic doctor.

25.) I am my own worst critic. I hardly ever let anyone see what i write (with the exception of that piece that got published in highschool- but even THAT was an accident) especially now that I've learned how to critique work better.

I'll tag when I figure out the notes thing in Facebook. :))

In other news:
I just drank the &quot;Best Beer in the World&quot; (otherwise known as Trappist Westvleteren Beer). I see why it's so special since the taste is so smooth but I rather prefer the Kriek Lindeman cherry beer more. 
I also just ate excellent Belgian chocolates called Verstraete. It was unbelievably delicious.
I love love LOVE Belgian waffles!"

"event","So today started out pretty well. I went and had my boots designed and they'll be ready in 2 weeks. That was fun. Then I went to Mall of Asia to buy gloves at Zara with their wonderful sale going on. Then I went home, where my cousin's boyfriend fixed my laptop which is great seeing as how my desktop decided to die last night. All of which made me smile.

And then my grandfather threw up blood and was rushed to the hospital. I'm at home keeping my grandmother company so she doesn't freak out and have another stroke. 

It's been barely two months since we had to rush my grandfather to the hospital. It feels like all these hospital trips will never end."

"event","&nbsp;Dec 30<br />We left for the beach today! I couldn't swim or anything which bummed me out but just the thought of going to the beach made me happy already. When we arrived I went boating with my aunt and uncles. I LOVE boating. I love the sea, the scenery, and the sky. Everything was breathtaking. Looking at everything reminded me just how much I'm going to miss the beach when I'm in Europe.<br /><br />Dec 31<br />New Year's Eve with crazy family members! I shall never forget my aunt who was yelling for marijuana and my grand uncle who dances like he's thirty. We had cheese, grapes, and fireworks in that order. Twas fun. I couldn't drink because i was a little sick but it was fun enough watching everyone else go crazy. The aunts and uncles kept making my brother dance for them as well as with them. <br /><br />OH and in the afternoon when I went boating with my aunts and uncles again, we had to stop by the beach to pick up my uncle's son and his cousins. The weather wasn't so great and the swells were HUGE so they had to swim to the boat to get to us. Long story short, the whole situation almost turned out into a Baywatch episode; except no one had to jump in to save them in the end (I volunteered to but my dad put an end to that so he was the one volunteered into it) since they just almost drowned instead of really drowned. Haha.<br /><br />Jan 2<br />My dad's birthday! Haha. We had a lunch here for him where the generations of the family were separated by tables. The theology teachers came by too with Rabeh and Eric in tow. Ugh the family had a field day making them uncomfortable. I felt so bad for them. But they did make my cousin very happy so I'm thankful for their awkwardness as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />After lunch we went laser tag-ing with the cousins. IT WAS SUPER FUN! This girl in charge must have had her period or something because she was so mean to us. She didn't even brief us about the game before we went in the &quot;zone&quot; so we didn't know what to the heck to do so we were just shooting and running around without a strategy during the first game. By the second game, when we finally got briefed, we totally kicked ass. We were the kings of the court! AND&nbsp;I WAS THE NUMBER ONE SHOOTER OF THE WHOLE GAME! 10, 000 plus points BWAHAHAHA. (as opposed to being second to the last in the first game)<br /><br />After the game, we went shopping in the fashion market and had dinner in Itallianis where we totally abused the free bread.&nbsp;<br /><br />Life is good.<br /><input type=""hidden"" id=""gwProxy""><!--Session data--></input><input type=""hidden"" id=""jsProxy"" onclick=""jsCall();"" /><div id=""refHTML"">&nbsp;</div>"

Today is eating-out-at-hooters-and-iceberg day with Alabangers and one Northerner! Bwahahaha! Hooters was weird. There was nothing to &quot;see&quot;, if you know what I mean.And the food was weird! They fooled us size wise and they gave me the wrong side dish to my burger meal. When we were thinking of complaining just for fun, I saw the fine print at the bottom of the ad that said &quot;not exactly as shown&quot;. BAH.

Anyway, after eating at hooters we walked around the San Mig by the Bay baywalk thing and saw children in bubbles running around the pool! Rich thinks that's how they power MOA. Slave Labor!

And then Javi got a nosebleed from &quot;speaking too much tagalog&quot; :D

Then iceberg! Where the ice cream was YUMMY. Yay! Ice cream and Alabangers always makes me happy. 

Dec 28
HIKING&nbsp;UP&nbsp;TAAL&nbsp;LAKE&nbsp;WITH&nbsp;COUSINS day. I say this in all caps for one reason: the experience was horseshit. LITERALLY horseshit. It was everywhere! As in you have to look down all the time to make sure you didn't step on anything everywhere. And the riders were so RUDE. I yelled at several of them when they asked us to move out of the way (I don't even know WHY they asked when there was like so much room AROUND&nbsp;us this one time. All the other times, they didn't follow the traffic flow. Philippines talaga.) There was this one time that this rider was complaining for my cousin to get out of the way saying &quot;kita mo sila, ang siga siga pa&quot; and I was all pissed and yelled &quot;ANG&nbsp;BASTOS&nbsp;KAYO&nbsp;EH&quot;. When my other cousins found out what I did, they said they were proud that I could curse in tagalog (but in fairness, I always curse in tagalog. I&nbsp;must have yelled PUNYETA at people like 10 times today. HAHA.)

I put this down as my Thing that Made Me Happy Today because in general, i love hiking. i love the fresh air, the exercise, and especially the view. There's no other beauty like nature beauty. And hanging out with people i don't get to see very often is always a plus.&nbsp;"

I FINALLY&nbsp;sorted through the clothes I want to bring to Belgium. It's such a sense of accomplishment, I tell you. Now i know what to go shopping for when i go to Greenhills. I also gave away lots of pants to the maids so that they can give it to their families. They were very happy. That made me happy too. :)

After all that. Javy and i played Zelda for like 8 hours. We went to bed at 3 a.m. I love doing these things with him. We used to do this all the time when we lived in Cebu. I help him out when he needs it but I watch him most of the time. I think he enjoys playing more when I watch him. :))"

- Go to IMDb and find a quote from each movie.
- Post them here for everyone to guess.
- Fill in the film title once it's guessed.
- NO GOOGLING/using IMDb search functions.

1.)&nbsp;  Don't blow smoke up my ass, it will ruin my autopsy.

2.)&nbsp; You seem more like the cat that got the cream and couldn't stop licking himself. 

3.) Remember that chap about twenty years ago? I forget his name. Climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down nearly dead. When they asked him, they said why did you go up there to die? He said I didn't, I went up there to live.

4.) Do you know what my daughter's nurse told her today? ""In a girl's voice lies temptation - a known fact. Eloquence in a woman means promiscuity. Promiscuity of the mind leads to promiscuity of the body."" She doesn't believe it yet, but she will. She'll grow up just like her mother. Marry, raise children and honor her family. Spend her youth in needlepoint and rue the day she was born a girl. And when she dies, she'll wonder why she obeyed all the rules of God and Country for no biblical hell could ever be worse than a state of perpetual inconsequence.

5.) Never is an awfully long time.

6.) I dare do all to dare become a man, who dares do more is none.

7.) Oh look, my tax dollars at work coming to arrest me.

8.) No. You want you to find this, because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding and or locating in your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?

9.) I'm quivering with anticipation.

10.) Do you think anything might tempt me to accept the hand of the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister? Do you deny that you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to censure of the world for caprice and my sister to derision for disappointed hopes, involving them both in misery of the acutest kind?

11.)  All right, Lewis, knock em' dead. That was a figure of speech. Please don't kill anyone.

12.) The brave do not live forever, but the cautious do not live at all.

13.) If you're not willing to act stupid then you don't deserve to fall in love.

14.) I own the hotel, and I live there. My life is very much like Monopoly.

15.) Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have!"

 bwahaha! i got tagged by phil.

RULES

The first player of this game starts with the ""6 weird things/habits about yourself"" and people who get tagged need to write a blog of their 6 weird habits/things, as well as state this rule clearly.. in the end, you need to choose 6 people to be tagged and list their names... (Source: )

1.) I find it hard to throw away empty shampoo bottles and whatnot. They pile up under my bathroom sink. I keep thinking that I'd give them to some recycling plant but it never pushes through. :|

2.) I like babies more than toddlers. It's just easier to take care of them and they're so cuuuuute.

3.) I don't like taking western medicines. (what?? i don't like the after effects!)
So I'm pretty much dead when i get a headache in the mall.

4.) I have to hit people. Don't ask me why. I just DO. (bwehehehehehe)

5.) If I want to, I can let a little amount of alcohol (like half a bottle of beer) affect me as much as 2 wine bottles would. (mind over matter, i tell you!)

..... or i may just have weak tolerance. Go figure. :P

6.) i eat breakfast at midnight. :D

I tag Panopski, Justin, Nielyman, Jim, Carlo and Rich.

"event","I wonder what it would be like to see life in a half spirit. If we are half spirit and half body, we're two halves of a whole. But when you live in your half spirit, how can you experience any emotion at all if all your emotions come from what signals you receive from your body?

You can't feel pain if you don't see the cause of it first.
You can't feel enlightened if you don't have the touch of life.
You can't feel love if you have no taste for it.

If we lived in our spirit only,
What then, does the spirit experience?

Purity?

We're untainted in that sense. Since we never have to deal with the alacrity of emotions that are the cause of the taint in spirit.

Hmmm...

Add a touch of asperity in that and it could be called emo.

"event","The river speaks in this humble abyss.

Can you name something more enchanting and immortal as the river? It flows and flows; and yet it is always the same. But at every moment, it is rendered anew. 
The secret of prosperity.
All the secrets that the river holds lay at the bottom. Where the rocks have fallen..

Would you be a rock thrown into a river? Where all the rock has to go is down. It has one destination, one path to follow. That is the only path it knows. It goes through the flow of life doing nothing. And yet it gets what it wants.. It goes where it wishes.

What a life that would be if we could get everything that we want. If we just sit idly by and let life pass us. Accepting what it has to offer and neglecting those it has not. Like the rock in the river. It falls into life and when it reaches the bottom, that's it. It's just there. It exists. It neither rejoices nor complains about its conditions because it knows nothing more than what it has been created to be.

The river cannot do anything about it. It is ethereal. Just like life. It watches, as each stone, in its misery or joy, sinks to the bottom of this cold, enchanting lair. Where many secrets live and die. Where many secrets are left untold.

Funny at how mysteries are what keep us alive."

"event","Has any one of you ever been tucked into bed?

I haven't.

At least to my recollection.
How strange. I never thought about being tucked in before. Although I always wondered what that would feel like since I've never experienced it. Until last night.

I think...

I think I was ""tucked in"" last night. Without even knowing it.

See, I've gone into the habit of going to bed without closing my curtains. (I get to see the sun come up if I've pulled an ""all nighter"" on weekends) I'm also a messy sleeper. I sleep with 3 pillows and a comforter. Come morning, my comforter is a twisted cloth and one of my pillows will most likely be on the floor. Last night was no different. I didn't close the curtains and my comforter was under my arms. (mid-body, more like)

But when i woke up this morning, they were closed. And my comforter was covering my whole body neatly. (notice the word ""neatly"") 
Imagine my shock when I woke up to darkness instead of light. And imagine my suprise when I didn't have to pull my comforter over me because of the chill I feel every morning when I wake up.

What a funny feeling.

Yet, for some unexplainable reason, I knew that my dad tucked me in last night.

Yes, I did go to bed at around 1:30. And I know that the possibilities of him being awake at that time and having this sudden urge to ""tuck me in"" is quite slim seeing as how he hardly ever does that...  

But somehow... I feel/know that it was him.

It's silly, I know.

But it's a new experience for me.

What a funny feeling."

don't get me wrong, the states was great and everything. but there really is no place like home.

I'd like to thank pat, raissa and kimmie for nearly breaking me in half on my first day in school. *scowls*


i think i've changed a bit because of that trip. i feel..... NICER somehow.

its impossible not to be nice in the states though. everyone is just so gosh darn friendly! it would be rude not to be friendly in return.

during the trip, i really got to know my family more. and sorry to say, I DONT LIKE THEM ONE BIT.

as travelling companions at least.

my sister REALLY got on my nerves during the trip. i swear i wanted to wring her neck and break her legs on more than one occasion.

i really miss junior a. we really were the best class. i will grieve for the moment. but only for a moment.

*sighs* at least we have many memories to cherish.

P.S.
the noisiness of junior a can beat the dull silence of senior c any day of the week!!"

"event","i wish i could write a long ass entry right on what has been happening in the states. but i swore to do that once i have returned home.


but in any case.....

i was in conneticut when i last went online. well, the next day we left for new hampshire to my aunt's lakehouse in lake Sunapee.  

IT WAS SOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!  and hell of alot of fun. we finally got to relax.... 

my cousin brought some friends over while we were there. they drank day in and day out. but they were good company nonetheless.

we returned to new york after that.  we spent 3 days there.

we spent a day with my aunt. we were just going around new york doing some shopping. we saw mary kate olsen in the restaurant we were having lunch in.

we went to watch lion king the next day. IT IS SOOOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!! it was better than phantom of the opera!! (i am NOT kidding!!!)

i am in canada right now! we arrived yesterday.

we went to Victoria island today. (i don't know if you guys gave ever heard of it) its a beautiful island that is an hour and 35 minutes away from canada (if you take the ferry at least)

tomorrow we are on our way to whistler mountain! its supposed to be beautiful! i hope we get to go skiing. but its summer now so i doubt there will be much snow left.

after that, we are spending a few more days in canada. (scheduled for shopping) then we are on our way back to san francisco! our last stop. we plan to spend our last few days shopping.

im not quite sure about my flight back home at the moment. but i am sure that i will miss a school day or two..

please forgive any grammatical errors in this entry. im pretty exhausted and i actually wrote it down so i wont forget any details when i write about the whole thing.

SO!!!! summary....

States:

San Francisco, Las Vegas, Arizona, Orlando, New York, Conneticut, New Hamphire, Canada.

"event","One night a guy and a girl were driving home from the movies. The boy sensed there was something wrong because of the painful silence they shared between them that night. The girl then asked the boy to pull over because she wanted to talk. She told him that her feelings had changed, and that it was time to move on. A silent tear slid down his cheek as he slowly reached into his pocket and passed her a folded note. At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down that very same street. He swerved right into the drivers seat, killing the boy. Miraculously, the girl survived. Remembering the note, she pulled it out and read it. ""Without your love, I would die.""

"event","im leaving for the states on monday. im gonna be gone for 6 weeks. im gonna miss my friends soo much.. 

but it was ok.  I got to hang out with my friends today. we had a blast! we met up in little quiapo for miggy's lunch and then we headed for town! we were supposed to watch a movie but we arrived late because i had to take the long route to alabang.

Pat, Raissa, Kimmie, Vinny and i rode my car. we took the f150 so we decided to ride in the back... despite the heat. the others rode in another car. when we got there, we were late for the movie na. So we headed to vinny's house.

we needed food and drinks. so mitch, vinny, don and i left to get them. i got to drive mitch's car! it was fun! we went to tahanan to ask if a friend wanted to join us. but she wasnt allowed to... to we drove back to vinny's house and ordered pizza..

After the pizza arrived, the fun began!! we made ginpom(sp?) and had some beer with the pizza. then we started fooling around having fun and everything.

i had to leave early. my dad said my curfew was 7 so i left at like 6 20. i kissed everyone goodbye (in the cheek, mind you..)

It was a blast!! im gonna miss you guys so much!!!!!!"

"event","I'm sure that every one of you here has experienced sadness and disappointment. Towards yourselves or towards the people around you.

Be it family or friends... People tend to disappoint. 

If you found out that a close friend of yours is not the person you thought he/she was, what would you do?

If you just realized that a close friend of yours has been lying to you since you've first known him/her, what would you do?

If you just found out that a close friend has been abusing your friendship, what would you do?

If you had to cope with that person for years because you thought that you could help change that person.. only to find out that its all been for nothing.... What would you do?

If you found out that the person whom you thought was decent, turned out to be a wild party animal who makes out and screws strangers at a party... what would you do?

If you found out that your really close friend did this to you, would you not feel disappointed in that person?

He/she lied to you about who he/she really was for YEARS.

You knew this person really well. (or at least you thought you did)

This person has betrayed your trust.

What would you do?

--------------

i slept at 7 o clock in the morning yesterday because of this little problem. As you can see... I am very disturbed with whats happened. Not to mention traumatized. (yes, traumatized. what caused that is too....er..... private to discuss.)

There is a story behind this. But i'd rather not elaborate.

Please state your opinions. Im interested in hearing them."

"event","i worry about the silliest things (if you would call them silly)

do you realize how much our parents spend just to keep their kids comfortable and happy? 

do you realize how much our parents spend to keep us safe and alive?

do you realize how bratty some kids get to parents who work soo hard just to give us a life to live?

and yet, how do these kids repay them? by doing bad in school, wasting their money on useless things, overspending, being a bitch to deal with...

do you see why some parents are always in a bad mood whenever they come home? on top of the huge pile of work they have to deal with, they have to put up with the bills and the taxes and their kids who are unappreciative and unthoughtful.

i hate coming across kids who are such friggin brats. they have no idea of the harsh life our parents go through for their kids. and even if they do what do they do about it?

nothing. nothing to make it better at least. those kids who constantly ask for things, talk back, disrespect and constantly disappoint their parents.

i pity kids like that. really.

i take my hat off to those kids who are making something of themselves. those who are excelling in their lives by improving on themselves and making their parents happy.

i think that thats what most parents want from their kids. to make something of ourselves.

that way, we aren't throwing our lives away.
we aren't wasting their efforts.
we're making them proud.

Really, how else can we repay them?"

im kinda annoyed/excited at their trip over here. for one thing, it'd be nice to spend some girl time with my sister. and some bonding with my brother. but on the other hand, when we used to live together we used to fight alot. and the last time they came over i was severly agitated at their behaviour.

so yeah... excited that i get to see them yet agitated that i'll have to deal with them.

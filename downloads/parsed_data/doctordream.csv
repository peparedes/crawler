The small child in seat 26E finally fell asleep. Five hours into this transcontinental flight, and only now can I hear myself think. Although the accommodations on Southwest Airlines are sparse, even a man on my salary can afford to see all of his patients with this new ding program. 

My current status makes it difficult to tell what time it is, though my watch says it is 7:06 pee em. If I am in the Mountain time zone, it is 5:06, and if I have crossed into the Pacific time zone, it is 4:06 pee em. In either case, I should land in about an hour. 

This cold winter has produced a surprisingly placid turn of events. At night, my patients and friends sleep soundly, thick warm blankets tucked into soft, comfortable beds. It is almost as if the chill in the air is so extreme that dementia and evil are oppressed - the wicked dislike the cold so much that they stay at home, plotting and brooding rather than murdering and despoiling. The metaphorical significance of Winter's chill caress and my own affiliation with the Pit is as comforting as it is shallow; each season in turn should have the effect of producing a placid and non-criminal response from the Lost. 

Still, I am struck by the tranquility among us. It was a scant few months ago that the traitors were forced to run wild in the Hedge, chased like dogs in a grim parody of the Gentry. There are many who feel that the Courts prevent us from falling into the deprivations of the Fair Folk, but I cannot help but feel that we act as we do not in spite of what we are, but because of it.

The Hunt of Leaves of the Leaden Mirror is merely one example of the depravity that binds us to our former captors. We decry and demean captivity, unless we are given the opportunity to satiate our most base and depraved of murderous desires. There is little doubt in my mind that a terrible man met his end at Camilla's court . . . yet any Western moralist in the past five hundred years would surely recognize that the antiquated notion of eye for an eye morality performs at a sub-par level. What possible good can come from adopting the stance of the despised Gentry, who ride down the Lost in catharsis of whatever alien and debauched pleasures sported by those strange consciousnesses?

There are many reasons for the Ash Run according to the Ashen Court. As the Lost, we reserve the right to punish and demean the workings of the Nobles. We are justified in bringing down the loyalists and criminals of our society, just as we are justified in the murder of our Fetches. Justified, they say! As if some how we earn the right to sin when we are sinned against! Our culture does not make the killing of a Fetch a crime, but our conscious does. It does because is must. 

The old ways, the old morals, the ways of brutality and cruelty are espoused by the Gentry. To adopt such depraved indifference for the well-being of any sentient is to fall victim to the same lurid temptations that motivate those whom we hate. The Fetch is created when the Lost is taken, our brothers in torment from the Fae. What rights, what moral imperatives mandate that we kill them because they are not us? 

The unfortunate truism of our society, our culture, is that it is not mature enough to embrace morality. We champion barbarism and death where civilized methodologies of reformation and rehabilitation are far more humane . . . more humane. That is the crux of the matter. We do not embrace the humane option when our hearts stir with fear and hatred for the Gentry. We embrace the darker, more perverse alternatives of death and torture. Our culture is not built on the logic that would compel us to restore sanity to the Lost. Our culture is not built on the reason that mandates an end to recidivism beyond execution. Our culture is tainted with the same cruelty that is espoused by the True Fae. 

They will not take my reason from me. I have not been so thoroughly beaten that, as a hostage, I am beholden to my captors. It is morality that separates me from Arcadia, and it is morality that I must hold more dear than life itself.

I must quiet now. The child in 26E sleeps fitfully. Perhaps I can bring him some peace.

The time is four twenty eight pee em. I just woke up. Some part of me wants to curl back up underneath the thousand thread count sheets, bury myself in silk and velvet and close my eyes for another eternity. The petulant child within me demands that I turn out the light and return to the deathless sleep where breathing is not so heavy and labored, where my head does not throb, and where Anne Guyer still lives.

We are creatures born of dreams, of glamor, and of passion. We felt the thorn prick from the rose of the gate of horn, and now that sweet odor is forever tinged with the pain of revelation. Anne fell in love with the rose, and her sanity shattered like glass against the thorn. Am I a King's Man, that I could not put her together again?

I could not find the Gentry that tormented her so. I treated the Butterflies for years - treating her symptoms if not her disease. Poor Anne wrestled with the nightmares over and over again - the poison infecting not only her but her lovers and their lovers. It was not until her lover came to my office with his own psychosis that I discovered the poison. It was right there, the obvious answer to an unnecessarily complex question. Anne Guyer had cheated on her paramour.

I cured Anne hundreds of times, each time purging her of the taint she succumbed to every time she slept with her lover and her paramour. I spent nights cleaning her mind, cleansing her dreams, oneiromancy unmatched in skill, but not application. Like a fool, I performed the surgery on her mind, never once recommending that she cease to pursue the same reckless behavior that shattered her psyche in the first place.

After years of treatment, Anne's body began to adopt the same broken stature as her mind. I could not stop the bleeding of sanity as it dripped from her pores. I could not quell the fugue of her brittle bones. Because I did not look for the cause of her malady, it consumed her.

Anne stopped breathing at 11:32 pee em last night. Her heart stopped soon after.

I went for a walk around midnight. Jayde joined me on the sidewalk near 376, where Stanwix runs into the river. We talked of remorse and regret. We talked of vindication and desire and in the end, we talked about Sorrow.

The world is a little bit colder today. The snow coats the ground as the ice clutches my heart. I am a child of Winter now. I hope it is a decision I do not regret.

The time is eight fifty seven aye em. The date is the 16th of July, 2003.

I have just concluded one of the more grueling sessions I have ever participated in. I cannot help but feel that the miserable heat of this summer is further degrading my stamina. If my air conditioning operated appropriately, my work would likely not be affected. As it is, I sweat, even in her dreams.

Anne Guyer dreams fitfully. Her mind sculpts clouds and serpents to slither through them. Large beasts, each at least as big as a bridge in the city, fly at her side. Each dream starts the same. Anne rides a serpent, bareback and legs spread. The obvious sexual imagery recurs in her dream, though I do not think it is prophetic in nature. She dreams of pleasant things, such as wind in her hair and butterflies (again, the cliche is concerning). Invariably and inevitably, one of the butterflies smacks against her cheek, the blue sky and white light soured by the streak of orange-red. 

In a slow moment, the white sky becomes burgundy, the white light shifts to the flickering golden orange of an inferno.

As her dream resumes, but her mind is filled with hundreds of thousands of shattered black teeth, each penetrating her skin as the beast she rides flies through them. She tries to bat them away but there are too many. Eventually, what shreds remain of Anne's flesh are consumed by a multi-fanged abomination that defies conventional description. It is not an entity with form, but merely a void which she interprets as bad.

Unsurprisingly, the repetitive nature of the dreams imply an inner strength that would intimidate many oneiromancers. Anne desires some of the sexual predation, fulfillment, and comfort. The teeth may disappear, the malefic entity that consumes may be destroyed. There are elements of the dream which are mutable. 

I simply can't do anything about the butterflies. No matter how hard I try, no matter what preparations I make, no matter my strategy or skill, I can not alter the butterflies. Night after night, one inevitably is crushed on her right cheek.

I have a client entering the office. Perhaps he knows how to kill butterflies.

The time is three ought two aye em. The date is the 28th of August, 2007. 

I have just arisen from my slumber, clutching my heart. I believed myself to be wrestling with her again. The last vestiges of my muscular contractions in my chest, which my cortex interpreted as the caress of fingers laden heavy with frost, are fading. 

I recall what it was like in her house. Each day, the games persisted. In her home of ice and shadow, I would stand as her aide. She would move too quickly, her fickle passions refusing to wait for analysis or strategy. I would give her advice the only way I could; by guessing how her opponent reacted.

Yet still, she would punish me. She threatened to leave me, to abandon me to the rest of Arcadia. Day after day, she told me how fortunate I was to be in her care. Night after night, she would explain that no one in the world loved me but her. As she tucked me in, burying me in the pages of her library, she threatened that the next day would be the day she discarded me. She plainly explained how miserable my life would be without her. As I watched the light from her lantern fade along the corridors of collections and shelves of scrolls, I could feel my security die. 

I would inevitably be awakened, her cold fingers plucking me from my chilled haven. Up and up I would rise, the little heat I had sloughing off like sheets of snow from a cabin roof. She would take me to her terrible breast and press me against the barbed icicles of her dress. I would enjoy her love for another day; as she rejoiced my blood dripped along the penetrating ice and silently stained her bodice.

I would advise her during the games again, and watch as my insight infuriated those against whom she played. They hated me, and I could feel the flames of their fury peel back flesh and flay skin from my slight frame. They enforced the notion that the only love in my world was from her.  She told me so, before she threatened to abandon me again. She would push me back with frozen fingers, threatening to lose me again. I clutched at her frigid palm, trying to get her to hold me again. I needed her.

Then I woke up. Today, I have three appointments. I will do my errands between ten aye em and twelve pee em. After lunch, I will attend to the guests. Then I will sleep again.

Most commonly, the Observer Effect is inaccurately referred to as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In Quantum Physics, the later actually describes the relationship between the measurement of the speed of a particle, and the measurement of the location of a particle. The trade off in accuracy means that any given measurement system is only so precise. In Quantum Physics, the former refers to the fact that observing a system is enough to change the system.

Systems imply order. Rules and pledges and determination that cause probability and predictability and precision. When an observer observes a system, those rules operate differently. The Government in the Sunshine Act was designed to bring an observer, in the form of the United States public, into the process of Governmental Legislation - much like an angry mother watches petulant toddlers. However, the purpose of the introduction of the observation was to instill the knowledge that such observation is taking place. Under the watchful gaze of Summer Court illumination, few Changelings are willing to pilfer the King's bounty of Goblin Fruits. 

Simply, behavior is altered when the system is observed. For these reasons, our psychologists observe children at play in bright rooms while they scribble notes in darkened rooms behind special mirrors. For these reasons our police intimidate captives with a silver mirror that shows only their own despondent state. Observation changes behavior.

Sometimes, individuals want to change behavior. This is where I come in. I observe people. 

Since I returned, I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of making people better. They invite me into their lives, seeking out my office, my hospital, my asylum, asking, begging, imploring me, myself, I, to fix, to mend, to cure them of their aches, maladies, insanity. I observe them, and they change for the better.

I can only hope that if enough people change around me, the Fae will notice them and just leave me be."

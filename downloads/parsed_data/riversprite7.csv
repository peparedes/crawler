Snape's and Harry's relationship started off with Snape helping with the baby and just to evolve naturally from there without confusion or dramatic insanity that you usually read in other stories. The author also managed to tie of all loose end nicely, living you with a feeling of closer. I would recommend this fic to anybody; I know that will be saving it to read again at a later date when I need some lighthearted fluff in my life.</font></strong>"

"event","I just finished a great Snarry fic called <a href=""http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19864"">The Way Home</a> by <a href=""http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewuser.php?uid=898"">Eriador117</a>, I must say it was so much better than I thought. A lot of times when I read a story were the main character has been sexually abused the author tends to make the recovery process and time very unrealistic. Eriador117 managed to make a story with a very realistic recovery process. <br /><br />The story follows the premise that Harry was sold into a pedo brothel when he was 4 and when it was time for him to go to Hogwarts, Snape was the one to go and get him. The story is pretty much about Harry coping with the sexual abuse, school life, and then later on his feelings for Snape. <br /><br />I think <a href=""http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewuser.php?uid=898"">Eriador117</a> did a beautiful job in conveying to the reader the trauma that Harry is going through. She(I'm assuming the author is a girl) also did a great job in building a relationship between Snape and Harry. The relationship started off as guardian and ward, to best friends and then at Harry's last year, future lovers. I loved that she perfectly timed her time skips so that you didn't feel if you are missing anything important, and you were not bogged down with too much filler. I also loved that she didn't go into detail about the rapes, you know they happened, but no nasty details. She also didn't bog the story down with too much smut. I love smut as much as the next person, but sometimes it can overshadow and cheapen the story. I think that if you had put any more of it in the story then she did than the story would not have come out as good as it did. <br /><br />If you are looking for an angsty story or a fluffy story than this is not it, if you are looking for a good drama and love story than you should defiantly check out <a href=""http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19864"">The Way Home</a>. The story was well written, the characters were well thought out and planned (I think considering the different circumstances they each went thought, Snape and Harry where not too OOC.), and the story was original. <br /><br /><a href=""http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19864"">http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=19864</a>"

"event","I have found Snarry fic find and I have fallen in love!  Even though I don't really need any fics found for me, just reading the post and comments you can find loads of Snarry treasures!  

Lacy Things by Diana Williams is quite entertaining.  I never thought I would like Lupin/Snape, but how can you not love a cross dressing Snape and Alpha Lupin? http://diana.slashcity.com/series.php?seriesid=1

I've got so many Snarry fics to read now, I just don't know when I'm going to find time to sleep!"

"event","I have noticed that on sites such as adultfanfiction.net and fanfiction.net that the Snarry fics are pretty bad.  You can find some really good ones, but those are far and few between.  In most fandoms that I read each site has their good and bad ones, but I don't know what it is about snarry fics that bring out all the crappy writers, but it is pretty ridicules!  

I know that they are trying and everything, but really, check the grammar.  I know I'm not one to talk, since my grammar sucks, but if you write something, put it aside and go back and read it 2 hours later.  You catch the majority of you spelling and grammar errors that way.  You don't need a beta to find the grammar errors that distract the readers and kill the fic for them.

Also, some new ideas please!  I'm so tired of the fics were Harry is secretly in love with Snape and Snape knows and takes advantage of him in detention.  Even though Harry is a virgin, his first time is incredible, despite Snape being very rough with him.  Or Snape rescues Harry, and Harry falls in love with him b/c of it.  Completely ignoring all the other times Snape has rescued Harry, and Harry still hates him after that.  The list can go on and on.  It is fine if you want to use the same story line, but put some meat behind it.  Tell us how and why Harry falls in love with Snape, despite the burning mutual hate they had for each other.  Build up their relationship, so that it actually looks plausible.  Give the reader a story that they read and fill that they are their sharing Harry and Snape's first kiss, or first nonviolent conversation.  

Don't over angst or fluff the story.  The readers need angst, fluff, and a some comedy interspersed throughout the fic so that they don't OD on each one.  Too much of each can kill a fic faster that a Mary Sue can.  And please be sparse with the OCs and OOCness.  Snape is an ill tempered emo prick, but that is why we love him; so don't turn him into a kind hearted fairy.  You can have him care for Harry, have his nice moments, and yet still be the sarcastic sadistic person who find a little too much pleasure in torturing his students.  Before writing a story examine why you like the character and keep true to that characters personality.  If you don't like something about that character, than don't just write that characteristic out.  Make a plausible way for that characteristic to be changed; and no Snape being a spy and only ""acting"" that way is not a plausible way.

I'm sorry for my rant, but I just tired of wasting my time looking through so many fics and only finding badly written stuff.  Or reading a really good description for a fic, to only be disappointed when I start to read it.  I know that I'm not a writer and writing a story is much harder than it looks, but really it is like some of the writers out there are not even trying, or need to release that writing is not their calling in life and they really need to give up.  

I'm sorry to sound like such a bitch, but I just needed to get it off my chest.  I'm usually not like this, but I just wasted 4 hours going through Harry Potter fanfiction and finding nothing good!  A couple years ago I used to read things and think that everything with my favorite pairing was golden, but I have found that my taste have matured.  Now it is so hard to find good stuff out there.  LJ does have the best writers, and the Snarry and harry potter communities that I have joined have great stuff, but after a while you get kind of tired of oneshots, no matter how well written they are.  I've always favored multi chapter stories and for some reason those are pretty hard to find on LJ.

Snarry snobbery might also have to due with the fact the writers such as Lee Lee Potter, RiffRaff, and LilRinnieB have spoiled me!  They are some of the writers that I first started Harry Potter fiction on and they are so good that most other writers seem to fall short.  If you haven't read anything by them, then you have no idea what you are missing!  Lee Lee Potter has an epic fic going called Death Eater Takes a Holiday, it is by far the best snarry fic I have ever read and one of the best fics that I have read in all the fandoms.  DETAH is my drug and I'm a happy addict, though there hasn't been an update since 6/28 and there is usually one every month.  I'm so chopping at the bits!

P.s.  So sorry for the spelling errors, it isn't my forte and I've pretty much given up!"

"event","<P>So its been forever again seince I've made a LJ post, so lets catch things up.</P>
<P>I am now living in Michigan with my father, who has agreed to alow me to stay free for room and board, as long as I go to collage. He has also agree to pay for any collage expences for classes I Ace. Obviously an offer I could not refuse.</P>
<P>However the process of setteling in has been slow. I've been here sence late July, however little progress has been made. I am still not fully unpacked, due to lazyness and space restrictions (Too many books to fit what little surface space we have, too many clothes for the drawers we have, and no place to hange anything cause the closet is full of unpacked boxes. Boxes cant be unpacted cause theres no where to put it all. BUT, slowly but surley we are sorting through the boxes, taking the things out we want/need and repacking to condence space. I just unpacked 6 boxes two nights ago.</P>
<P>I have found that it is apsolutly nessary now to get my drivers licence, as I cannot get a bank account here without one, nor can I apply for collage. However, the process of getting my licence is both expensive and tedious. Michigan state law dictates that I need 3 forms of identification in order to get my licence, which I would normally have (CT state ID, Birth Certificate, Social Security Card) However, they have a rather strict list and will now alow my social security card to be used. Therefore, to follow with the list, I have go reissue my passport (And pay all the costs included in that) before even applying for my licence. So I sent my Birth Certificate away with a PITA application form and photos, and have still a week to wait on them getting a reponce to me.</P>
<P>Job wise has been more or less sucessful though. Becca and I are both employed again, in almost identicle jobs as our last ones. I am a prep-cook and dishwasher at a place called EG Nicks, while she works at Taco Bell, another fast food place. Together we are managing what little bills we have easially and have already saved up 800+ dollers to buy a car with.</P>
<P>All and all things are looking on the up...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""and here comes the drama...""> ...except their not.</P>
<P>Though my Father gets along deicently with Becca and I, tentions are beginning to rise. The 'fatherly pressure' he asserts to get things done and to remind us of things are beginning to get more assertive, and on my nerves in the meantime.</P>
<P>He has me attending RICA (Right of Innication to Cathlisim for Adult), basically, church classes. I mainly joined to please him, and to learn a bit about the catholic faith and religion, as it is typically habbit for me to study religions like that. However, as I go through the classes, it seems that the entire premisis for takign the classes was that you had already agreed to become Catholic, in which I had made no such agreement. I consented to taking the classes on the grounds that it would help me with a personal search on the spiritual level, however upon reading the handout book they have given me to study, there apparently was an alternative course I could have taken called RINC (Right of Inquiry for Non-Catholics.) Sounds to me like there was path without the peer pressure of becomming Catholic available to me and I was convinently not informed. (Or it could be that the class is simply one and the same in our area cause the later is not vailable) Needless to say my father has some explaining to do in either case.</P>
<P>Also my father seems the not be content in the fact that I have a part time job and want me to look for another, full time job, and quit the one I have upon aquisition of the other. His reasoning to this fact would be that I could save more money for a better car this way, and would not have to worry about the vehicle surviving the winter. So much that the last conversation on how I explained that although I had only 3 days of work this week, I still managed to suck up about 24-25 hours out of it. He immediatly went like ""Thats not acceptable, I would go out monday and start looking for another job."" Which I dissagree with. These hours are pefect for when I start collage in 3 months (provided everything manages to go through ok) Ontop of which we are still managing to save a deicent amount of money with the hours/pay the way they are. Needless to say I am opposed in getting a car in the first place, as it would add yet another bill to worry about during a time in which I will not want to have to focus on expences in order to spend more time focusing on say, my studies? Not to mention the fact that I wont want nor (knowing how erratic my energy levels are duing school times) be able to manage&nbsp;a full time job ontop of collage. Which would be what I would have to do in order to afford a car ontop of current, and comming collage costs. Also, why pay insurance on somthing that is mostlikley going to sit in the driveway most of the time? Becca and I both bike to our jobs, and the school is in biking distance. Typically in the winter we end up walking if the roads are too slick for our bike tires, but with how warm the winters have been the past few years I dout that is much of an issue, even in the Great Lakes area.</P>
<P>Lookign at it logically. Work and School are in close distances. I have no friends out here, and the only time I visit my aunt or brother is with my father, in which case we ride in his Jeep. If my brother had the time to see me, he would visit me, as I have already offered him gas money to come. So quite simply, I have no reason to have a car yet. Though I am saving money for one anyways, mainly to keep my father quiet.</P>
<P>Speaking of father... here he comes now. I'll update on Becca and I later. </lj-cut> </P>"

"event","So I've setteled into my little escapism habbit again. Emersing myself in work with School, playing with FFXI or Gaia, and generally not leaving that pattern. And to be honest. I'm kinda content that way for now. I know that I really CANT do anything else given my situation, and I satasfy my wanting to get out with the reminder that with school, there isnt a fat chance of it. I expect it to be the same way with work, but at least then I can work towards the goal of getting my licence and a bit more freedom.

So here I am, updating my live journal in a pretty much abandoned class because of the crappy weather, though school is still on. I cant eat my ramen cup because I forgot to bring a fork with me, but I managed to eat my crackers and fruit cup just fine, which has suprizingly been holding me over. So theres no real complaints.

Infact, this are pretty damn good now, asside form yesterday's migrane. All I am waiting on now is a bloodly paycheck form my workstudy to start my bank account with, and start becomming alot more independent.

Well there isnt much more to post. I know there isnt any huge deep meaning or any important events in my life on here. But awell, I like being able to have a happy post for once. I think I will do it mroe often.

"event","Usually I dont like to sit here and vent to a journal. Mainly because I like venting to people cause at least then somthing is heard. But right now, everyone is asleep, and the more I try to vent, the more I alienate people, the worse I feel, and the more I vent. So I have to try to do it here, before I loose everything.

But there is good too, but I will start with the bad first.

My events in the past few months have steadily been getting worse and worse. Ontop of getting unsatasfactory grades form last term do to illness, I alienated someone I conistered to be my family: Zero. That seemed to be the start of a very steep downward spiral that has become my live at this point.

Sence then I have be ignoring my other friends, online and off, with the exception of FFXI. However, all the stress of my stupid, really not so bad life, gets poured into there, and I snapped at a friend for somthing stupid, and now I've lost that friend too. I cant blame her as it was entirly my fault, but it really hurts hard when you are uncappible of making up for your mistakes, especially seeming the issue itself wasent that large, but the events surrounding it were, which made it overdramatic. 

My combined guilt over all of these events is causing a horrible change in my habbits and atitude. Put simply, I cant eat much at all anymore without wanting to throw up. (And seeming I am now under 100 pounds, this is a VERY bad thing) I havent been able to sleep latly, what little sleep I do get is short and very uncomftrable. I've lost ambition in alot of things that I have spent the few years working very hard to be a part of. And I cant seem to shake off this horrible pitted feeling in my chest that constantly pains me.

I really want to talk with the people I have wronged and try to work things out, or at the very least have a final discussion so things can be ended on not so bad terms, but I dont know how to start, and I dont even think that they would want to talk to me any more. I dispise feeling so helpless against my own mistakes, but this is pretty much what I am now. Helpless. I dont know how to say it openly and I dont know what needs to be done, but... I need help. I'm in a rut and I cant pull myself out of it anymore. 

To put it into prespective, I feel as if I am standing in my own grave on a rainy day, And the more and more I try to claw at the wet dirt to get out, the more I bury myself. I'm chest deep in all my own crap, and though I have been able to work myself out of it before, I just cant seem to now. 

Anyways, enough with the bad. Lets try to talk about the good.

I've managed to get a group on my game, which seems to work pretty well. Although it is alot of hard work, it is also alot of fun.

The new building of KG seems to be running on one leg, but it is still a nice place to have a school. I am back in classes and will be getting busy with work again rather quickly. One more half to go befoe I throw myself back at the workforce, each day is another day closer to graduation.

Sam pulled away from the stress that was Jen Lee, and is on to better things. Not nessarily bigger, because thats not the way he like to live. But better, happier things and I am glad for it.

My life really isnt so horrible when I compare it to others. But as I like to say. Its just as cold at 60 degrees for those who live in florida, as it is at 20 degrees for those who live in newengland. These are my problems, and although they may not be as bad as other peoples, they still hurt plenty."

"event","Hmm. The holidays are comming. For the past few years I havent been able to enjoy the holidays like I wanted to, which is spending time with friends and family. From the looks of things, this year wont be an exception to that trend, but I seem find with it.

Spending this vacation in a relaxing mannor seems to be good for me somehow. Even though I have had problems with food and money, I am more mellowed out than I was during classes. I realize I am going to have to step up the pace when school starts again, but that is two and a half weeks away, I really dont want to think on it yet. 

I am so content in just sitting here and resting, though tomarrow night I will be picked up by my mother for X-Mas dinnder and resting at home for a few days. I am sure I will get my usual dosage of Adult Swim as I will be claiming my former room form my mother. 

So I will be away form internet for a bit, not that it really matters. I think I can use the time unplugged.

Its been four months sence I stared a bank acount with Savings Insitute, and they have yet to get my bankin card to etiher me or my mother. This is ridiculous. I'm just going to start a account over Here. SI May treat SAM well but they havent showed me any good serives to date. 

I'm in my nice little isolation trend again. I'm even shutting out my online friends. THe only thing I really do online is go to this fourms site and role play with people I dont even really know, just to get my agression out ""alone"".  I am realizing why I am shoving everyone away too.

My migranes have gotten worse lately. Every morning, and every night. I cant get any good sleep during the times I need to, even when I try. Its making me very irritatable. I've been finding myself trying not to make a smat ass remark to any one of Sam's jokes now. And I've shut Zero away competely. Goodness knows what kind of sparks would fly if I got into a conversation with HER in my current state. I love her as a sister, but I to hell if I am going to let her have to deal with my curretn atitdue. She's got enough to worry about, and we really dont need to worsen eachothers moral by getting into a fight. 

There is one good thing so far though. My brother and his wife (oh my god, I cant beleive I forgot her name!) Have been talking to me over the internet. Thats cheered me up a bit. We talk at least once a week over voice chat. I cant wait till my nefew Connar is born. Its nice to know that they are doing well at least, and that our family bloodline will live on for another generation at least. It kinda makes me homesick of Michigan, because I havent seen cliff sence before I left for Connecticut.... and now he's married and having a child! 

*Sigh* Awell, I'll get to visit them when I get done with KG. Speaking of which, I have bunch of books to order... boy this is going to get painfully frustrating. I need to order them Via online and they mail them here. At least I know that they DO get here! I have my books for photoshop class. But I still need to order my books for all my other classes.

I'm in for a long, intimate relationship with computers it seems. If I am not on them at home, I will be during classes. I just hope I will be able to keep focused.

Well, I was partically right, it pounced on Sam instead....

He got fired form his job, as he undoutably posted.

Now I find myself, here, stuck between now and the time I leave for my school, worrying about how to cheer my close friend up, worring about how he will recover from this, if he will be ok. He seems in total shock form this, and... I find myself competley helpless to do anything at all about it. 

If I cant help him with this at all, I pretty much am competely useless to him here. 

Ugh... there must be somthing I can do... anything.

I will probley brainstorm at school today, when I am susposed to focus on class. Awell. Its only the first week...

The more and more things start to beome rough for Sam, I start to dout more and more about my own abilities in the work feild. I am pretty confident that Sam can trug through. But... I dont think I would be able to handel the stress of it all.  Freelance looks more and more inviting than actually doing a full time job in graphic design. But that wont be enough for my goals..... I dont know. My migranes are really preventing me form thiking straight any more. And its ruining most of my sleeping habits.

I just hope I can find some way of makign Sam feel better. I just feel so badily for him right now. I know he'll come through, but isnt there some way I could make him feal better now?"

Was it the profoundly moving and modivating speach from sam? *BUZZ*

Was it the fact that I actually ate some good Subway? *BUZZ*

Did I *gasp* get a girlfriend? *BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ!* 

Nope! Out of all things, its the chair I am sitting in! I got sick of the small wicker chairs that is good for spacing in this room but gets uncomftrable as all hell in the long run, and of couse, I sit by the computer alot. 

I got fet up with feeling so damned uncomftrable, went into the kitchen and got the old wodden chair that I bought with me back into the living room. Sutffed the lining full of pillows like I normally do, put my feet up a bit, set th keyboard accorst my lap, and just sat back.

It was almost orgasmic how much more relaxing this feels! I never though such a simple thing would be so influential on my atitude as of late, but DAMN this feels better!

Its probley juts because I am sitting in a position I am used to most of my life, but I really dont care the reason as long as I feel good.

"event","My rage hit its mark yesteday, and i had to ask sam to go to bed so I could blow it off to my online firends, and not hurt him with my temper.

Normally, I lay in depression untill my anger snaps, and then I feel better for blowing everything off in a pile of steam.
It diddent work too well this time around, I have nothing to really be angry at.

I just feel hollow...
Everyone who sees just end up rushing to my aid, and makeing me feel worse off than before. I dont want to waist their time. Its not them who I want for comany, not when I am weak. I'm there for them, not the other way around. Its how I manage to deal with people, even my closest friends. I dont like asking for favors much, and people dont know how much it lies on my conciousness when I do have to.

I owe Viccy 5,67 for spotting me lunch
I owe Midnight over 20 bucks for all the spotting she has given me
I owe Sam swordlessons and my time for Photoshop skills, and so much more for letting me stay in his appartment for collage.
I owe Zero so much for being the one person I can depend on to slap me in the face when I am headed in the wrong direction.
I owe Flilz her books back.
Hell I still owe Nate and Bret all the lunch money they spotted me back in high school
I owe half of my online friends a deicent rp without  constant interruptions. 

These are things in my heart I HAVE To repay, weither or not they will let me.  The more I owe people, the less I feel like a person, and the more i feel like a part of a michene, a servent that will never repay his debts. And all the while I never seem to get  closer to that childhood dream of mind, infact I seem further away with each passing moment...."

"event","Well Its been a long time sence I have updated. Mainly just because it seems like an Inconvience for me to pull out a Journal Entry. But you know, I will most likley be posting more.

That is if I can ever get MY computer fixed so that It can go online again.


A side note, on my RPGamer forums I posted ""Rebel's Question"" I am anctious on what sort of replies I will get from it... infact so anctious I couldent really sleep last night. Awell, I slept all day so I am fine so far.

Still, I wish there were some way I could calm Sam down, he is winding himself into self-hatred, and that is a bad thing, speaking from expirence. 

A good note was in the time I was nervos I fixed my screen name on his computer  so  that I could get on the internet. Pain in the but, but I just duplicated his settings to mine, it took a bit of swapping back and forth to get it right, but I did it, so I dont have to be on his name. he should be happy about that. YEY, I finally did somthing  good on my own.

Lately I have been feeling kinda Useless, having to rely on Sam or someone else to get things done. I hate it. I hope it changes soon, before I blow a gasket or three. 

Awell, such is life I suppose. I hope to be posting more often now though.

"event","Well, I have gone to join the Wiccan Comunity on LJ (The comunity noted, not the pratice) 

Its come to light that I need to be learning more on what people view, what they beleive. So I can thake this into consitation with my beleifs as John Knasinski. I hope its as informative as I need it to be. 

College is starting soon, and the closer I get to it, the less I can sleep. I guess its because I am excited. I don't know. I am definately going to post more in my LJ when I am in college, mainly because I will have more to say. This journal will pretty much serve as the recording of my college year, and any others to come. Also, this, as always, will help people gain an insight to me, and how I feel on issues.

On a sadder note, for those that dont know my mother had a mamagram yesterday. They found a lump... which needless to say proves as a scare for the whole family. There still has to be more testing done, but I still cannot shake the pit inside my chest, telling me that this is going to be bad. I hate to say this, but most of my bad instincts come true.... I just hope this is one of the occasions I am wrong.

Alot of things are going through my head again, mainly on where I am going to go, and what I am going to do after Katheryn Gibbs. I am really appricating that Sam is letting me move in with him, I dont beleive I could have gotten nearly this far without him and his friendship. I just hope I wont lag him down while we are living together. Although some of our living styles are similar, some are still differnt. I know we will both adapt to a happy medium, but I hope that dosent end up slowing him down.

Alot of my reicent thoughts go to Zero, and the situation she is stuck in. There are times where I cant phantom the level of frustration she is going through. And once again I want to help, but 1 I dont want to overstep my boundries with her, and 2 I really dont know what to do. She must be feeling somthing of the same thing about her roomate, which is going tough so much pain. Once again, I find my hands tied when I want to help out...

There are also alot of issues going through my head I wont post on the journal, some of which regard my heart, some of which regard my spiritual beleifs, and conflicts that are going on therein. 

I am glad that my life is going forward again..... but what if I cant keep up anymore?

Tonight I had two and a half helpings of Steak Dinner at Firemans Restrant. Nate finished off like four helpings, Gen Yeiger, who I have finally gotten back in contact with again. Finished off about three, and her friend had one. All in all it chosted me 30 bucks for like twenty pounds of meat!!!! It killed my fundage, but BOY was it worth it. I would go out and do somthing like it again, if I diddent have to work tomarrow.

I've decided it best for myself if I just avoid the subjects (and people) that are causing tention in my heart right now. I am finally getting myself re-setteled, and my confidence is beginning to really come back again. A part of it is due to a nice reminder from Gen, that I have this uncanny ability to be apart from people for months at a time, but still be their friends at that distance, and just pick up later as if a day haddent even passed, with her as the prime example. 

 I got, and am going to contiue to have this problem though. About when someones life isnt really going well, I throw mine down into the dumps volentarily to try to help them through it. Call me stupid, but for some reason I get this urge to help people at times, especially if I feel attached. ANYWAYS, dispite that, I gotta learn that in a world like this, not many people are going to do the same for me. And that some people are like me, they wont learn a lesson unless they learn it the hard way. Unfortunately, this has chosted me to loose contant with 3 out of 3 woman I have ever had a serious relationship with. I always get the urge to check back and see how they are doing..... but somthing stops me. Awell, Se La Vi. I just hope those people find their own happiness. Maybe one day I'll finally find mine with somoene. 

LOL I put out a personal add thingy with Emode-Match, pretty much out of sheer bordom. I fill out all the little self discovery tests, they are pretty cool actually. Anyways, if anyone wants to look ints in emode match, you gotta be a member before looking though.

The dragging pain in my heart is over now. I am left to tend my wounds. This I must do alone, I am sorry to my friends, beleive me I appricate everything you have all done. I cant alow people to be close in now.... like I did before. To some, I may take it as just pity, or paying me back for attempting to help you. For others, my fool of a heart may take it wrongly...  

I MUST be alone now. At least inside. I cant let anyone close at this point. Those that attempt to heal these deep of wounds, will risk hitting a brick wall of coldness, or risk finding themselves somewhere they do not want to be. I have never felt such pain before, and I am weak now. This will be my only outward plea to keep distance. Love is a treacherous thing... it leaves you dizzy, with wounds that can never fully heal, and with holes wanting to be filled.

"event","Last night I was remided of somthing unexcusable that I did. And I have been spending  the time I have been awake, thinking about it.... 

Alot of people dont know what I did. Cause it only involved those that I knew online. Regardless of that fact, I still consiterd them my friends. And I did somthing horrible, manipulative, and dispicable over a year ago.... and I dout I will be able to get over this without some assurance from someone.

This was during the time I beleived I was in love with a woman named Kat. Everyone that knows me well enough knew that she lied to me costantly, and played with my heart. This post is to let those people know as well that I was not a simple victim in this, and that I too was as low as she was.

The things that were happening to me.... well. I was being hurt, and of course, I wanted to hurt her back. I lied to the people online, posing as a close friend. I told everyone online that I comitted scuicide, or attempted rather, by slitting my writs the wrong way. I betrayed the trust of friends online, to get at the heart of the woman who was hurting me, the one I beleived I loved. 

Physical distance means nothing as long as a person can be emotionaly close to me, weither this is friendship or relationship. In my blind emotion I did not consiter the consequences of my actions... And now I know that it may well have permantly damaged a friendhip I held dear with a friend online. 

This was a stupid, blind action of a needy, selfish, irrisponcible boy. And I will possibly never be able to forive myself for hurting people by seeking to control their emotions, by feigning an act that never happened, and quite possibly will never happen. 

I could never slit my own wrists, in fact I'm actually afraid of harming myself, especially with knives. If I had my choice of weapons, I would choose a katana over a double edged sword, for  fear of hurting myself with a sharp end I couldent control.

Those who know me know that I say I walk on the ""knife's edge"" Part of if means that I walk on the path between light and darkness, fantasy and reality. Good, and Bad. But it also has a meaning no one knows untill now. Its the path of pain, of fear. I am constanly afraid, so it appears that I bear no fear.

Walking a fine line like this hurts me, because..... I feel like I belong to nothing, I want to be able to be on one side or the other.... To either be able to help people, without the  need to get back at people that hurt me. Or I want to be ruthless, so I dont have to feel such guilt when I do somthing bad. But I dont belong in either path... So I walk the knife's edge, because I beleive i have to.

If this confession reduces any respect people have for me, I will endure it. Its time I paid the pipper for the stupid shit I have done. Though I will probley be pathetic and hide myself from it all, wallowing in my hole of selfpity, guilt, and remorse, as I have done before on countless ocasions. 

Let this be proof to some people that I am not a ""good"" person... Dispite what they think. Every time I hear someone say that to me, I feel I dont deserve it. This act I just told everyone is a reason why. 

I'm done here. Anything more would probley be stupid. And I have already said too much..."

Somthing happened to me last night that dosent happen often at all. And I wont say it here in the Journal. Although my Deffinition of Love is differnt from anyone elses. I still find myself sometimes wanting the ""love"" that everyone else seems to imagine.  In the end I guess thats my goal, to understand and be understood, fully. To understand and embrace the ture definition of love everyone else seems to embrace, or yearn for. And to have people understand my definition, which I beleive is the 'pure' form of love.

But in the end, I think that my form of love istn the whole picture. Although it is pure and trusting, its also denying parts of a person. Where as true love is everything good and bad. 

Although I want true love, I will settle for ""pure"" love for now. For with pure love, you at least know your cared for. And its better than nothing i suppose...."

In the end, it dosent really change anything, or maybe it did.

I now look foward to what I can do for myself while I wait. Although it seems selfish, I am not, because the things I do for myself usually benifit others, and its not as if I am abandoning her in any way. She knows well enough that I love her and will be there when she needs or wants me, at least I have given her that kind of solidness to lean on for now, untill she makes her decision either way, and afterwards as well I think.

For me, I know now who I choose to shower my affections twards, and while I wait for that person to decide to accept me in that capasity or not, I can consentrate on the tasks I set myself out to do before I met her. Although she is still constantly in my thoughts, its not more of a modivation to do the things I do then a pain of longing.

"event","I gotta figure out a way to speak as if I dont have a superiority complex. I guess its how it comes off alot. But in the end it dosent change the way I feel about issues, I just have to learn to hold my toung about things somtimes, and just express the end result of it. That no matter what, I still seem to be around. 

Another issue with me is the words ""I love you"". I think over time and missuse, those words have completely lost their meaning when they are said. I reconized the trend of it when my stepmother stoped saying it back. I think she diddent belive I ment the words when I said it. But I did, I just love freely, unfortunatly. 

I figure it this way, I am one of those weak sentamental men that beleive if the world had less hate, it would be a hell of alot better place. And there is the part of me that wants to destroy the world becasus of its ignorants. I hate ending up being a hypricate. I know as well as anyone that in this world you have to be strong, I am being ingorant myself in beleiving that it'll change. Awell, one can hope. 

Anyways, back the issue. I had consitered this so much so many times before, that if I really met my true love, what will I do to express it..... What I actually came up with when it happened seemed a little childish, and stupid. But, it ment more to ME in doing it than a million ""I love you""s, More to me than a wedding band.

I always come up with weird ways of expressing things... somtimes its direct, and somtimes, well, its nearly impossible to really discover some of my other methods, and when they are, its silly, and somtimes conistered stupid. And sometimes, I express somthing without knowing it, then discover what I did later, and kinda look at it all shocked like. 

Awell, tomarrow is nemsis night! (or day seeming that we are doing it during the daytime more than the night, or is it night then, I donno, the sun sets early now, so I am kinda confused) A couple of my friends are nervos to be metting my old High School buddies, but I am confident that this is going to be the most kick ass night I have needed in a long ass time!.

Amists the tossing and turning, I realized somthing. The simularities. Its undeniable. This feeling of helplessness is the same as before. Actually.... the pain is worse than before, because this time the feelings are real..... were as before they were just an illusion. Its more frustrating because I am fighting to get though a web of dispassion, not someone's web of lies....

My mind burned with so many thoughts, so many possibilities. I finally pried myself out of bed, and took benadril to force me asleep. 

In the end, it changes nothing, cept now I have more of an idea on why I get so upset. The subborn refusal to see, not my point of view, but the simple truth, harms me. The rebelious retort that seems so similar to a child pushing against the parent, where all there really is needed, is an acknolagement of the worry and care of a friend, and the gratitude, that at lease one person, cares.. wounds me. But my determiaton will never wane. I will hold to to myself, my feelings, even if  it ""kills"" me, and even if it kills me....

"event","I'm setteled and peaceful, I am disturbed and chaotic. Back and forth I go and I dont beleive it will ever end. Do I really want it to? I am not so sure anymore.

I have a bitersweet sence of things now. Sam is realizing that he is alike me. I do not know for certain weither or not this is from my influence, or just from his own self discovery. Either way, I beleive disptite the fact that he should be able to think for himself, I would not want him to go through the kind of daily torture that everyone here seems to have. Awell, just chalk it up to another one of those things I can't change.

I am really looking foward to ""Nemisis Night"" the so called event where five people whom I know, two more reciently, three from high school, and myself go out on a mall fest and at the end of it watch Star Trek: Nemisis. Thus the name. 

Technally this will be the first time I have seen Filiz in person sence she and I have ""broken up"" I use that in quotes because I realize that the whole seperation diddent change the way I feel about her at all, if anything it strenghtened it. I wonder if I will end up figthting mixed emotions.

Anyways, the plan beeing that we meet a the mall, then split guys/girls and go mall trogging, I have a feeling some of us will do last minute X-mas shopping, and we will end up going to the same places anwyays, because we all have alike tastes. This is an oppetunity to get two people that I wanted to meet together, namely filiz and heather. I have absoultely no idea on what is going to happen with that mixture of lifestyles, but I also invited brandy over, so there would be a third person around to prevent any huge disputes if one even occurs, which I dont think will happen. 

Another secret motive is to have heather help filiz in some way. Giving filiz another possiblity to entertain could only help in the end for her. not to mention heather has some pretty good ideals when you manage to get them out of her, I think they will both have a good time hanging out with eacht other. 

As far as the guy side, its me, nate, and mikey, this is the best possible combo for party-fest. Nate loves to just go nuts on a stress out, and so does mikey. They are both laid back on the suphace with problems underneath, which is kinda my issue as well, cept I am now more open about it now for some odd reason. This can get my mind off of issues and catch up with old friends. In the end..... I know that everyone involved needs this day, and I know it will be a blast.

Untill then.... work.... computer, sleep, up, work, computer and videogames, sleep,up, work... with the occasional eating somewhere in there. Speaking of work.... once again, i need to get ready."

"event","I am finding myself in chaos again. Last night as i curled myself into a ball to sleep, somthing rare happened. For a brief instant, i cried. I dont really know the reason. My mind was wandering about my past. It stopped as sudden as it started, but it was a horrible, wonderful feeling. It lets me know that I am still alive.

Everything about me is unbalanced again, I am catching myself trying to figure out who I am, what do I beleive in. While I am lieing in quiet, my heart is pounding in my chest for reasons I cant comprehend. I am shaking even as I write this. Somthing inside me needs to break again. I need to understand myself once again. What do I beleive really? What do I stand for in a world that seems so meaningless.

In the same note all of this dosent really seem to matter to me.... It dosent matter who I am compared to how I feel. Its odd. I keep thinking of others besides myself, when its myself I probley should focus on. Focus, heh, I think thats impossible for me right now. I need to know what I am. When good and evil are mirroring views to me.. I really dont know what I feel I am cappible or incappible of doing.

I got to go to work...... maybe there I can clear my mind"

"event","Whew, if anyone thinks it dosent involve had work, they are SO WRONG. I busted my ass off last night, helping to make over 135 pizza's in two hours! When you get your pizzas form Dominos, be sure to thank them, cause while you are only ordering a simple medium cheeze pizza, the pizza-makers are baking an order for sixteen other pizzas whith four of five toppings on them each! Not to mention all the chiken kickers, bread, cheezy, and cinna-sticks, and the buffalo wings! ALL HAIL THE PIZZA-MAN! 

Anyways, I get home last night early, because I found out that unless I am spifically scegualed to close, I get off around nine! Of course, I get home at about ten because I got a ride after a dilivery. I get home, hoping to suprize my buddies and what do I find MY BLASTED STEPFATHER, who came home from work early (note that the took the three previous days off due to a hurt foot) and he is on the fucking computer watching the stupid girlly sites, WITH MY INTERNET! GRRRRRR! 

After about eleven, I stoped bothering to wait and see if he was going to get off, and went to bed.

A week form tomarrow untill Nemisis Night! I gotta make sure of Nate's involvement. Cause if he dosent go, I can't give Filiz a ride there, and that would suck. Awell. I will do my best to get a hold of the elusive friend before then. Anyways. I got to go to work again. I will be online around ten-oclock. Mabe then I can get into contact with everyone"

You are the one who usually tries to take on the world for any cause you believe in. You are a natural leader in most circles and are not afraid to take that position if a situation calls for it. Others look to you for inspiration and praise you for your acheivements. Even though they love and adore you, however, you are left feeling alone or overwhelmed many times. You're almost always positive and keep your chin up despite any setbacks because you know that you will succeed in the end, no matter how long it takes.<br><br><center><a href=""http://quizilla.com/users/Elblai/quizzes/Which%20Classic%20Story%20Role%20Do%20You%20Play%3F""><font size=""-1"">Which Classic Story Role Do You Play?</font></a><BR> <font size=""-3"">brought to you by <a href=""http://quizilla.com"">Quizilla</a></center></font>


Kinda scary considering Katy's results.  Oh well, quizzes aren't everything.

PS - I just read about Katy's change in employment (to none) and WHOA!!!  I'm calling her right now."

"event","Have I ever mentioned to the 3 total people that read this thing that I LOVE music?  

<br>
<br>
Doves - Black and White Town

<br>
<br>
Anyone who has digital cable also has access to lots of free stuff
through ON DEMAND. I have been watching music videos and I was reminded
of how great codeseven is. And I was also reminded of how creepy giant
bunnies are. In addition to that I was reminded that I don't get nearly
enough readers on either of my blog deals. It's unfortunate, but I
suppose that's the way of these things when you don't have a lot of
friends that are ubergeeks. I guess this thing's still less than 2
months old too. I don't know, I just want to feel like there's a
purpose to what I'm doing. If I was writing about my problems or
whatever it wouldn't matter if people read it or not. But I'm trying to
spread some sweet-ass news, and I want to get other people excited
about this stuff. Well, congratulations livejournal, you've managed to
pull out even more complaints from my mind. So for those who read this
and are potentially unknown to me, you should check out this <a href=""http://jordandolce.blogspot.com/"">better blog</a>
if you haven't yet. I don't update that often, but I try. And please,
if you have any response at all to anything, go ahead and post. Hey,
even the new pope has commented on one of my stories on the other blog.
Thanks to all those who read anything I write. And as always, I hope at
least a couple people find something useful.
<br>

"event","Today is the last of a long series of days working at Bistro Wasabi.
Starting tomorrow I'll be enjoying THREE DAYS OFF!!! Apparently before
work today I have a lot of things to do around the house, including
moving boxes of my stuff, setting up my mom's computer, and putting
more doorknobs on. You can see pictures of the large device I found in
my yard at my <a href=""http://jordandolce.blogspot.com/"">real blog</a>.&nbsp;
Right now I'm watching ""Attack of the Show"" and this guy is on who made
a little movie about Mario getting killed.&nbsp; He just said that moms
were calling in complaining that their children were devastated because
their hero was dead.&nbsp; Check out his movies <a href=""http://www.videogamedc.com/"">here</a>.&nbsp;
Well, it's off to work with me.&nbsp; I'm going to teach my mom how to
match the colors and the back of her computer to make it work.<br>"

"event","All moved in.  Check my real blog in a couple days for some pictures.  I swear this is the ""tired house.""  Always, without fail, at 9pm every member of my family begins to fall asleep.  It's very sad.  Also, I don't know if my room will ever be right.  There's so much stuff I just can't believe it.  I need two rooms still.  Now I start a long period of working every five seconds.  

Wed - work, Thu - liquor serving class, Fri - work, Sat - work, Sun - work, Mon - off, Tue - work, Wed - work.  

Wow....just seeing it all like that makes me tired and sore.  I pity my poor, abused feet.  I soooooo wish I could finish watching Wolf's Rain soon.  Right now it's time for some Xenosaga so I can go to bed a little later and not be a total loser.  You know, I really kind of have to stay up late.  If I go to bed at 9pm one night, and then work until 10:30pm the next night, don't you think I'll just shut down at work?  I don't know.  All I know is that I have got to force myself to stay asleep later than 7:15am.  No alarm or anything, that's when I've been waking up.  Does this livejournal business force you into complaining or something?  I think there are greater powers at work behind this webservice.  I am very suspicious."

Too bad it can't all have been done yesterday.  I do so want to move into the new house and finally be able to get on with life.

Good luck, be strong, don't relent."

1. Today was a good day, and an excellent Saturday. Woke up and did my stretches (again! nearly like a whole habit!). Got up early-ish for a weekend -- like, 8am.

2. Took Kenobi to the vet with <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://chaosmanor.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://chaosmanor.dreamwidth.org/'><b>chaosmanor</b></a></span>. He's doing so well -- paw healing up, and generally so pleased on the Good Drugs. We're to continue to do ridic rigorous healthcare things for another week, and bring him back next Saturday.

3. I finished <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://www.dreamwidth.org/profile?user=cupidsbower'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://www.dreamwidth.org/profile?user=cupidsbower'><b>cupidsbower</b></a></span>'s beanie! At so long last! Now that I've reminded myself I can knit, at least for short periods, <i>and</i> I've removed the faint guilt of 'you should be working on the beanie', suddenly I want to knit All The Things. Next up on knitting: finish the ten-stitch doily thing from even more forever ago, and maybe start a table runner for the sideboard \o/

4. It stormed today! And wasn't too hot! Kiba was so Alert and On Guard during the whole thing, poor darling. It feels like it's rained so little, and I'm almost never home to savour it properly. I've missed it so much.

5. <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://chaosmanor.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://chaosmanor.dreamwidth.org/'><b>chaosmanor</b></a></span> and I took Kiba to the park where he ran around happily, and fetched our somewhat clumsily thrown balls with great glee. He was less pleased with the compulsory shower afterwards (hello grass allergies, ugh), but endured it stoically.

Bonus: the I played more Fallout 4, and refreshed Tumblr a lot, and now it's not even 11:30 and I'm pleasantly tired. Winning :)"

"event","And possibly also yesterday combined, because 

1. It is very very hot today. I've not looked up to see how hot, but enough that things are still hot and ugh at 10:30pm. ... Just looked, actual temp is 30C ish, apparent temp mid-20s, but it's totally 30ish in the house right now. Air con for sleeping tonight. At least it's not humid, and I've solidly learned that difference.

2. Yesterday we had a work gathering at work, instead of usual staff dinner. And it was really good -- the weather was great, it wasn't too noisy because it was outside, the food was meat-heavy and delicious and very prompt (yay on-site catering!).

3. Before gathering, co-worker and I strolled carousel looking for an A5 spiral bound notebook for me for work. (srsly, how hard is it to find an A5 spirax notebook? A: Impossible where we were. Not even Kmart or Target had them.) But at work today she'd bought me one (a top bound thing, but so, so feeling the love)

4. When I got home from gathering, <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/'><b>samvara</b></a></span> had bought and left on my bed a <i>gorgeous</i> present <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Eating-through-Zombie-Apocalypse/dp/1940363365"">Eating through the zombie apocalypse</a>. It's beautifully put together, funny, and has a CDC-zombie-outbreak outlook to food preparation and emergency cooking/survival. I approve wildly, and am into this.

5. I've give my cold to my co-worker and my housemates. Boo :( On the other hand, there's a shitload of people sniffing and coughing on the train, and at least one other person sick at work, so it's clearly Making The Rounds hard.

Bonus: Got a call from the insurers of my Super income insurance. I called them back, like a grown up, and answered their question honestly, and they're like ""yeah, that's fine, thanks."" sooo it seems like I'll have the income protection insurance I want, I hope \o/"

1. Today was a bit of a wash, mentally and productivity wise, because I was sicker (cold-ier) than I realised, and the afternoon was a bit of ""sitting and staring"".

2. I didn't drive to Granny's as planned because of it -- I stayed home and hung out with <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/'><b>samvara</b></a></span> while she played Fallout, and then I went off and played Fallout myself for a while. I did call mum though, to  check that she'd got my text message about piking (1+ adult point to me!), and she was totally relaxed about it, and mentioned that Granny was also cold-ish.

3. I mentioned to her that now she'd organised her will and in particular given me enduring power of guardianship that I really wanted to sit down with her (and Granny) and have the end-of-life conversations -- what she wanted, organ donation etc. I don't think she was expecting that at all, but dude, I need it. Also, I should start thinking about my own.

4. Finally sent off the Insurance Adjustment form for my super, and got the 'change of fund' form from work. Filled out the change of fund form even! Handing it back in tomorrow. Wild progress, I hope.

5. I borrow-nicked <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://chaosmanor.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://chaosmanor.dreamwidth.org/'><b>chaosmanor</b></a></span>'s beard trimmer to buzz my underarm hair, which worked a treat (prepping to wear super pretty blue top with cap sleeves). So easy and quick.

Bonus: made smoothie! Drank it while waiting for the bus, and it was okay. Looking forward to experimenting from all your comments <3"

I got myself out of bed to go to the beach, and drove <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/'><b>samvara</b></a></span> and Kiba to said beach. <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/'><b>samvara</b></a></span> guided me through parking with cars on either side. Still not something I'm comfortable doing alone, but I did it! Kiba was so well behaved, and the water and weather were wonderful. It was packed at the beach, more people than I'd ever seen usually (hi public holiday). Then cafe for breakfast. Iced chocolates are like food of the gods at the moment.

2. I made a smoothie this morning before we left the house, too; practice for making smoothies when I'm in the morning rush. (long story short: I'd been eating breakfast at work at my desk of a morning, which I was aware was pushing it but boss finally went from 'only during homeroom' to 'no more, sorry'. So! Smoothies. I might battle to find something that tastes 'good', but current recipe:

soaked oats and chia seeds
frozen berries
a little water
big dollops of yogurt
a bit of cottage cheese (apparent 'super secret' ingredient of the foodie websites. I'm not convinced but am going to finish the container anyway)

Mix, then stubbornly apply stick blender.

Anyone have their own smoothie methods?

3. I wrote! I wrote 100 words and then I wrote a little more, and I have half a ficlet. Oh my god.

4. I played Fallout 4 for the first time a few days, too. Have left Piper in Diamond City, and took Nick as a companion because I couldn't find Deacon. Take that 'it's been a while since you did the thing..."" anxiety!

5. We've been feeding Kenobi mince to take his meds (wild success), which last round turned out to be amazing-quality beef hamburger patties cos that's what was left at the IGA. They smelled so good raw that I sequestered two for myself, and had one this evening with rice and beetroot 'salad'. A+ life choice, although the rice was slightly hard. Still good.

All in all, an excellent day off. The fact that tomorrow is Wednesday is going to be unbelievably confusing.

(Bonus thing! Women's International Cricket, broadcast on channel 9, on Australia Day. So many women being expert and sponsored and on TV and it took my breath away)"

"event","Fellow Yuletider, hi!

Whee! Here we go again! (Alt: If it's your first time, welcome!) I hope you're excited and not freaking out too much.

My general likes/dislikes have tended to stay consistent through the years. Feel free to read back through the tags below, and this year's is below, if you want. 
<lj-cut text=""likes/dislikes""> 
Things that I love!
<ul>
<li> This year, with these fandoms, I'm edging mostly towards gen, or already-established relationships that aren't the centre of the fic (major exception here: Brides of Christ).  Relationships wise, femslash delights me in particular, but I'm also pleased for slash and het.</li>
<li>I've worked a list of fandoms this year that contain or could contain a bunch of women. I'm all for skilled, well-rounded, messy, flawed humanely-written female characters, basically.</li>
<li> I have a competency-kink a mile long. It doesn't matter what people are doing specifically, anything from teaching, to baking a cake, to putting together machinery. I just really enjoy watching people do things well with assurance and skill. See also: physical competency, the ability to kick someone's butt etc. :D</li>
<li> Intimacy. I don't just mean sex or physical touch -- that ease you get with someone when you've been together forever, and can hang out in their personal space and never bump into them; all the inside jokes you build up; knowing they're okay or not okay at a glance. That sort of thing.</li>
<li>Also! I struggle with plot at the best of times myself. If you find yourself writing a plotty epic, that's <i>fantastic</i> and go for your life. Or if you're sitting there thinking: 'they have to <i>do</i> stuff? ohshit.' I am A-OK with a thousand and one words of worldbuilding, or a lazy Sunday afternoon, or character study or <i>whatever</i> takes your fancy with these characters or this world, I suppose in the case of the Ray Bradbury.</li>
</ul>

Things I'd rather not read for Yuletide:
Rape/non-con, mpreg, partner betrayal, relationships breaking up. I have a major embarrassment/humiliation squick. Please don't show characters getting their hopes up, or getting excited, and then getting squished for it.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Fandoms!"">
<b>The Martian - Andy Weir</b>
Choosing book or movie as my request was <i>hard</i>. I finally came down on the side of Mark's humor, and the *amazing* team that came and got him. If you're after springboard ideas, I'm allll about their wicked competency, and the phenomenal bonds between them that meant they all went ""yup, willing calmly to die for each other, no question."" I'd love to see more of them working together. I had pangs that we didn't get to see them with Mark in either book or movie: I was craving comfort and patching up and touch and hugs, because holy hell, 18 months is a long time to be alone, never mind in terrifying circumstances. Another and/or idea option: So long alone, in constant danger would super fuck someone up, doubleplus points for Ares/ground crew supporting him in the immediate and/or far trauma-aftermath of Mars. I know we have book here, but I 100% endorse Mark teaching baby astronauts back on earth.

Pairings? I'm partial to a side-serving of Watney/Beck, and a doctor's healing touch ;), but don't stress if that's not your cup of tea; I'm good with gen, or other pairings in the background.

<b>There Will Come Soft Rains - Ray Bradbury</b>
Wow. I first read this via the sign up lists, tbh, and was blown away. If you have an idea (pre-doom, during-doom, post-doom, anything!) run with it like crazy. If you're looking for a springboard: I love the idea of who/what came after, piecing together what happened  last year, or hundreds of years later, or how it's remembered and what people are saying about it. Do we still have inane robots chanting stuff at us? What's the tech like? etc etc.  A completely optional detail of my heart: I know the (in-fic, entirely fictional, self! Jesus) dog is long dead, but I'm sad for it anyway. A dog nursed back to health, or a hale and healthy dog as part of the research crew, or you know, just a beloved dog that lives past the end of the fic, would completely make my Yuletide. *wry grin*

<b>Pet Sematary - Stephen King</b>
I saw this listed, thought ""huh, I loved that book"", then saw the single character and <i>stared</i>, because my <i>god</i>, that's fantastic. So, writer, how she's <i>doing</i>? (I'm running under the assumption that Rachel killed Louis, and relatively soon after that was killed herself, but having now typed that, I can see that going any number of directions) Where's Ellie now? College? What do people think happened? What does *she* think happened? What does she know? What's she done/doing with that knowledge? I could see her, depending on what she knows, taking refuge in the hard sciences and skeptics, or swinging hard the other way and getting deep into the occult, or any combination in between. *quiet starry eyes at whoever thought to nominate this*

<b>Brides of Christ (TV 1991)</b>
Oh god. I just saw the first ep for the first time in so many years and it broke my heart in the best way. It's possibly the most tender friendship-into-relationship I've ever not-quite seen on screen. I'm interested in that journal, and if Paul kept pages, secretly. I want to see if they can reconcile their love with the love of God, and furtive, tentative making out and gah, my heart. 1,001 words of that would make me unbearably happy. If you wanted to go for advanced level, so to speak, I've also just seen Catherine's relatively calm acceptance, and then utter steadfast support when Paul decides to leave the convent. Had they gently drifted back to friends by that point? Being able to see the path of that relationship from beginning to beyond the series would be magic. (Side note on side characters, I adore Sister Ambrose so much. And I really appreciate that even Sister Agnus, by the end, is shown softened and human and with warmth towards Catherine, even if they're still on opposite sides of the fence.)

"event","Yuletide writer! Wow, hi, suddenly we're here again! Welcome, if you're new to all this!

Okay, my general likes/dislikes tend to stay the same across the years (see my dear writer tag below if you want to browse past letters), but I reiterate them below, just in case ;)

This year, I'm carrying two old favourites very dear to my heart, and have found two new favourites in the fandom nomination list. The two new fandoms are fresher in my mind, so get All The Rambles. Word count doesn't correspond to amount of love; I would be equally delighted with getitng an Old Faithful filled, so to speak, as I would a more recent-to-me fandom.

<b>Above the cut, general things!</b>
If you're panicking about producing a fic where people have to Do Stuff, and there should probably be Plot and a Story Arc, and Character Development, and Characters Learning Shit! You totally don't have to. I'm all for 1,001 words of lazy Sunday afternoon; a bunch of vignettes or drabbles; a slice-of-life; a five-times fic; a missing scene or chapter, etc etc... I mean, if you've been bitten by a bunny that is all about the Plotty Character Development then shit yeah, run with it and be joyous. But it's not required.

I will say, though, that if you have an idea that you want to write for whatever fandom/s we've matched on? Write it. Ignore whatever I've said below and write it, seriously. If you're having a ball, that shines through no matter what you're writing, and I'll love it, too.

<lj-cut text=""Likes and dislikes"">
<b>Likes</b>
I'm happy with any 'level' of rating and relationship, from gen friendship to no-sex-shown relationship, to graphic, kinky sex. I have a power play kink, but don't feel at all obliged to include that if it's not your cup of tea.

I like complicated, human relationships. The sort of relationships where you know the other person really well -- how to needle and hurt the other person, just as well as how to make them happy, and which option to choose, and keep choosing. I prefer non-miserable endings to peoples' relationships, but take it where the story leads you.

I have a competency-kink a mile long. It doesn't matter what people are doing specifically, anything from baking a cake to putting together machinery. I just really enjoy watching people do things well with assurance and skill. See also: physical competency, the ability to kick someone's butt etc. :D

Intimacy. I don't just mean sex or physical touch -- that ease you get with someone when you've been together forever, and can hang out in their personal space and never bump into them; all the inside jokes you build up; knowing they're okay or not okay at a glance. That sort of thing.

Happy endings, although I get that they might not always be possible. If a happy ending doesn't work for your fic, I'd totally go for bittersweet 'things are still fucked, but we're still together and hanging in there' in its place :D

<b>Dislikes</b>
I have a strong embarrassment/disappointment squick, which mostly manifests in a 'person gets their hopes up about X, and then gets those hopes squashed or gets laughed at.' I can deal with it marginally better if, by the end of the fic, the person has rationalised it as a learning experience/can laugh about it and generally doesn't feel upset anymore.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Fandoms!"">
<b>Alliance-Union by C.J. Cherryh</b>
This is the little unlikely-fill-fandom-hope I keep carrying from Yuletide to Yuletide. :)

I loved Cyteen and Regenesis, and I'm craving Justin/Grant fic to round out the experience for me. The fact that their relationship is canon delights my soul, and those little touches (the horrifying note under Justin's pillow; the delightful moments in the morning after Justin gets back from Playns etc) has left me craving so much more of it (see the intimacy-like above :D). They were under so much pressure for so long and I'd love to see how they helped each other through. I'm happy for there to be explicit sex, fade to black, or no sex at all. Take it where ever you're comfortable :)

Alternately, I am always, always up for Catlin and Florian being competent and awesome. I'd rather they weren't explicitly a couple, but if you happen to have a bunny that includes them being together, then I'm game :)

<b>Alien: Resurrection</b>
Ripley here is competency-kink incarnate for me :D The tension between Ripley and Call was electric, and I love Call desperately *wanting* to be human, as much as I love Ripley looking curiously at her human side, seeming to wonder what it was... Would be delighted by femslash, but would be equally pleased with gen friendship, or a solo character study of either/both of them.

<b>Kings</b>
Oh god, the last few eps of this show just about killed me. I specified Jack and David because, well, I figured listing all the characters I would love to get fic about would knock me out of the matching race pretty hard. Both this and <i>Orphan Black</i> were last-minute realisations during sign ups, so I'm slighty more scatterbrained about them.

Scattered thoughts: Jack freaked me out in the last ep or two. I want to believe he can do good -- he's been brutally fucked over by Silas, by so many people. I want to believe that David was someone he could have learned to trust, and been real with while the lights were on -- Bible canon says they were lovers, depending on your interpretation, I wanted to see it, and how that might have developed. Maybe he finds his way out of that room and over the border into Gath. Maybe it's all a fever-dream. Actually, the ending of the show was so unnerving to me that I <i>want</i> a happy ending for that particular arc, even if the show is pointing and laughing at me. 

Um, if you ticked Any and are now cursing because you'd rather not write Jack&David or Jack/David (I'm good with either): Thomasina! Mashed all my calm, composed type competency kinks, even if she did side against Jack in the end. I'd love to know her story, and/or her backstory. Or Michelle being very cleverly banished for a year, I don't know how exile works, exactly, but my own headcanon is that she totally went: ""Right! to Gath I go!"" and finds David.

Side note: I'm totally into religious trappings, if that's also your jam. My reading of the show was that the <i>characters</i> totally believed in the existance of god, even if the show creators didn't. I'm up for genuinely-relgiously-minded characters.

Other side note: There's the potential for Jack to <i>hate</i> Lucinda, and I really don't want to read that. I'm all for Lucinda blossoming into a force to be reckoned with, though :)

<b>Orphan Black</b>
This SHOW, right? I realised after I'd signed up that I was subconsciously angling for 'happy families' which, ahahah, oh, brain. Basically, I love this show so much, but by its very nature, they're in danger and misery all the time (minus awesome clone dance party, but even then, Cosima!) Um, basically I would like them to have a little breather and happy-family time -- maybe a pre-series Christmas, or something (See above about knowing each other really really well). Alt: non-time-specific gathering thing, any and all Clone Club welcome.  I love Felix, and how fiercely he and Sarah are siblings even if they're not 'blood'. I ADORE Mrs. S as an IRA-people-smuggler, and how good she is with kids, and I am Very Concerned that the show is steering Mrs. S to be more involved with the Science than I want her to be. I desperately do not want her to be a bad guy.

Or, if you tend towards the darker and grittier than the light and happy -- I'm Totally There for fiecely protective Mrs S being physically and psychologically brutal to keep Felix and Kira and Sarah safe (see: the scene in the safe house, holy <i>shit</i> so amazing).

"event","<b>What I've read this year:</b>
<i>Arclight by Josin Mcquein</i>: A solid enough post-apoca YA novel. Strong opening pacing. I finished it thinking that I would be interested in reading the second one, once she needed a plot, and where she'd take that plot.

<i>Gifts by Ursula Le Guin</i>: A bequilingly simple story. It does facinating, tiny things; setting us up with an expectation of Horrifying, Inevitable things to be revealed. This expectation kept me reading for a good half of the novel, even though there wasn't much in the way of plot. And then Le Guin introduces a gutting emotional component that kept me transfixed for the next quarter... and then she deftly subverts that initial expectation, does the reveal, and it's nothing like what we expected, and so much more horrfying than I ever expected, and I'm even now faintly shivery about it, thinking it through. Also interested in reading the sequel and where she starts/takes her plot.

<b>Attempted to read:</b>
<i>A Thousand Kingdoms by N K Jeminsin</i>: I gave it 50 pages, and then stopped because of consistencies and holes in worldbuilding. People are welcome to assure me it firms up, and I'll wade through the lengthy dream sequence that was the dealbreaker at page 50ish.

<b>What I'm currently reading:</b>
Monstrous regiment by Terry Pratchett"

"event","Sorry! I hope you haven't needed to be refreshing too much!

I confess that I'm cobbling this together from other letters, and you can find those under the dear writer tag, if you want... I was going to say more information, but realistically it's the same information repeated in different ways. *wry grin*

I will say, though, that if you have an idea that you want to write for whatever fandom/s we've matched on? Write it. Ignore whatever I've said below and write it, seriously. If you're having a ball, that shines through no matter what you're writing, and I'll love it, too.

<lj-cut text=""General things"">

If you're panicking about producing a fic where people have to Do Stuff, and there should probably be Plot and a Story Arc, and Character Development, and Characters Learning Shit! You totally don't have to. I'm all for 1,001 words of lazy Sunday afternoon; a bunch of vignettes or drabbles; a slice-of-life; a five-times fic; a missing scene or chapter, etc etc... I mean, if you've been bitten by a bunny that is all about the Plotty Character Development then shit yeah, run with it and be joyous. But it's not required.

<b>Likes</b>

I'm happy with any 'level' of rating and relationship, from gen friendship to no-sex-shown relationship, to graphic, kinky sex. I have a power play kink, but don't feel at all obliged to include that if it's not your cup of tea.

I like complicated, human relationships. The sort of relationships where you know the other person really well -- how to needle and hurt the other person, just as well as how to make them happy, and which option to choose, and keep choosing. I prefer non-miserable endings to peoples' relationships, but take it where the story feels like!

I have a competency-kink a mile long. It doesn't matter what people are doing specifically, anything from baking a cake to putting together machinery. I just really enjoy watching people do things well with assurance and skill. See also: physical competency, the ability to kick someone's butt etc. :D

Intimacy.  I don't just mean sex or physical touch -- that ease you get with  someone when you've been together forever, and can hang out in their  personal space and never bump into them; all the inside jokes you build  up; knowing they're okay or not okay at a glance. That sort of thing.

Happy endings, although I get that they might not always be possible. If a happy ending doesn't work for your fic, I'd totally go for bittersweet 'things are still fucked, but we're still together and hanging in there' in its place :D

<b>Dislikes</b>
For Yuletide this year, I'd rather not read rape/non-con. I have a strong embarrassment/disappointment squick, which mostly manifests in a 'person gets their hopes up about X, and then gets those hopes squashed or gets laughed at.' I can deal with it better if, by the end of the fic, the person has rationalised it as a learning experience/can laugh about it and generally doesn't feel upset anymore. 
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Fandom-specific things"">
<b>Cry to Judas</b>
Oh my god, so many complicated places you could take this. Or simple places. To be honest, I don't have a firm grasp on the narrative the vid is telling, and maybe there *isn't* one. There are so many threads here, and you could pick one and follow it (the pregnant girl with the presumably anti-abortion mother) or you could damn near braid a bunch of threads together (the pregnant girl and the 'satanist' girl who has a crush on her... etc, was roughly how I was interpreting that sequence, but again, is so wide open to interpretation). You're welcome to take any thread, and any relationship combo (gen/het/slash/femslash) and run with it.

<b>Cyteen</b>
This is the little unlikely-fill-fandom-hope I keep carrying from Yuletide to Yuletide. :)
 
I loved Cyteen and Regenesis, and I'm craving Justin/Grant fic to round out the experience for me. The fact that their relationship is canon delights my soul, and those little touches (the horrifying note under Justin's pillow; the delightful moments in the morning after Justin gets back from Playns etc) has left me craving so much more of it (see the intimacy-like above :D). They were under so much pressure for so long and I'd love to see how they helped each other through. I'm happy for there to be explicit sex, fade to black, or no sex at all. Take it where ever you're comfortable :)

Alternately, I am always, always up for Catlin and Florian being competent and awesome. I'd rather they weren't explicitly a couple, but if you happen to have a bunny that includes them being together, then I'm game :)

<b>The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert</b>
This is sort of a sneak-signup drift for me, a little. I love Tick, and his relationship with his still-wife and especially his son. If Benjamin had been a nominated character, I would have hands down requested a fic about him. As it is, I'd love a fic with Tick and Felicia back in Sydney, with a side serving of 'omg, looking after a kid, do we know how to do this?' :D

<b>Alien: Resurrection</b>
Ripley here is competency-kink incarnate for me :D The tension between Ripley and Call was electric, and I love Call desperately *wanting* to be human, as much as I love Ripley looking curiously at her human side, seeming to wonder what it was... Would be delighted by femslash, but would be equally pleased with gen friendship, or a solo character study of either/both of them.


I hope that helps! If you want more info, or you have questions, you can PM <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://meghanc.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://www.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://meghanc.dreamwidth.org/'><b>meghanc</b></a></span> and they'll pass messages back and forth accordingly. Good luck, and have fun (and, lets face it, stress the hell out, but I hope the fun and excite balances out!).</lj-cut>"

"event","<span class=""userContent"" data-ft=""{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"">Labor/a  guy called George Wright emailed me a few days ago, asking for  donations to help win the 'neck and neck' polling race. He asked me to  foward the email on to three friends. This was my mostly-coherent reply.  I'm sending it to more than three friends.<br /> <br /> Dear George,<br /> <br /> I read the first email you (or your staff, whichever) sent with interest and pleasure. I was excited by even the possibility of<span class=""text_exposed_show"">  a Labor win, given how bleak things had looked previously. I considered  donating. I had $50 in my bank account earmarked 'political donation'.  It was going to go towards Labor, and the sudden wild hope of that win.<br /> <br />  Then the news of the PNG 'solution' broke, and I was horrified and  disbelieving. Surely we weren't producing an asylum seeker policy that  would leave *Abbott* impressed? And then the full page advertisements  appeared: giant 'f*ck off, we're full', like the back of some racist  bogan's ute, advertisements produced by *my government*, representing  *my country* to the world.<br /> <br /> And then this evening I saw the  photo put out by DIAC, of the terrified woman learning what was going to  happen to her, what my government was going to do to her, and to  thousands of people. And I realised, vicerally, that *she could be me*,  that she could be a friend of mine, any one of my loved ones. That if  she was allowed to settle in Australia, that she could be my friend. And  that we, *my country, my party* are terrorising her *for votes*.<br /> <br /> &quot;We get to choose the Australia we want to live in,&quot; you say.<br /> <br />  I don't. I don't get to choose a Prime Minister who will treat her  compassionately and who will care for her as she needs. Both Rudd and  Abbott will treat her equally brutally. This is a nauseating realisation  for me.<br /> <br /> I do get to choose where I send my money, and my  support. Accordingly, my donation money is going to the Greens. I will  speak against this Labor government whenever I can, and I will speak for  the Greens wherever I can.<br /> <br /> This Australia you are speaking for is not an Australia I want to live in.</span></span>"

"event","Squeaking in just in time with my Yuletide rec post!<br /><br />I didn't read as nearly as wide as I wanted to be able to do this year, but there were standout fics everywhere! Here are a handful that made me laugh, cry, and/or gave me that heartsqueeze of recognition.<br /><br />My gift!<br /><br /><a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/579995"">Birth</a> <b>Neverwhere</b> (Implied Hunter/Serpentine. Content notes: mentions of non-con)<br />The telling of Hunter's mortal growing up as a captive of the Roman Empire. This is realistically grim and brutal, and is a fiercely determined Hunter in every way possible. It's weird still, to me, to be thinking: 'someone wrote me grim, brutal fic! Yay!' But, YAY! :D<br /><br /><br />Other recs:<br /><br /><a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/599729"">Six Moments in the Life of a Shadow</a> <b>Digger</b> (Digger &amp; Shadowchild)<br />This one made me delight in the philosophical conundrums Digger finds herself in when explaining things to Shadowchild. Then it made me laugh at fabulous carnivorous fruit. Then it made me cry, and made my heart swell, and generally left me overwhelmed with feelings. Highly recommended if you know the comics.<br /><br /><a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/608083"">Reunion Song</a> <b>Push (2009 movie)</b> (Nick/Cassie, Cassie is 19)<br />Cassie is so realistically, justifiably angry here, and all her relationships -- with Nick, with her mother, with the world, are so visceral and believable, it makes me ache. There's so much yearning and hope and humaness.<br /><br /><a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/600824"">we shoot the scene again and again</a> <b>Push (2009 movie)</b> (Nick/Cassie, Cassie is 18. Content notes: mentions of pregnancy)<br />This is a fantastic use of both second person POV, and a detailed, fantastically close look at what it would be like as a Watcher. Wonderful descriptions and vivid use of senses.<br /><br /><a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/594959"">This side of paradise</a> <b>The Losers (2010)</b> (Cougar/Jensen)<br />Moving out of the gritty realism into the really funny. 17000 words of Cougar and Jensen going undercover as gay, and I found myself <i>rocking and weeping</i> with laughter. And sometimes shouting at Jensen through my laptop screen. *hearts*<br /><br /><a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/601229"">There's kinks in this yarn, but it still knits up fine</a> <b>Knitting (Anthropomorfic)</b><br />All the knitting fics were fantastic, frankly, but this one was the stand out for me. <i> The diary of a circular needle who just cannot STAND the thought of knitting another *(@#ing scarf. Luckily, KnitLife.com exists.</i><br />Wildly inventive and remarkably sensual, this was delightfully funny, and charming."

"event","Yuletide Author!  <p>Whee! Hi! I hope you're not freaking out too badly, and that you're excited. If in fact, you're panicking, can I offer you a drink? :D If you'd rather not know anything beyond my initial sign up prompts, that's awesome, go forth and write!</p><p>If you're looking for some of my general likes/dislikes follow me under the cut!<br />&nbsp;</p><b>General things!</b>  <br />It wasn't until I looked back at my sign up that I realised I've essentially asked exclusively for slash and femslash. That said, if you're swearing or sweating over that for whatever reason, I am <i>totally okay</i> with having that relationship be in the background of an otherwise gen/worldbuilding/plotty epic/individual's character study/five times/series of vignettes-fic.  I'm also delighted by any &quot;level&quot; of depiction of the relationship: from handholding and shy kisses to kinky rough sex. :D  <br /><br />If you're panicking about producing a fic where people have to Do Stuff, and there should probably be Plot and a Story Arc, and Character Development, and Characters Learning Shit! You <i>totally don't have to</i>. I'm all for 1,001 words of lazy Sunday afternoon; a bunch of vignettes or drabbles; a slice-of-life; a five-times fic; a missing scene or chapter, etc etc... I mean, if you've been bitten by a bunny that is all about the Plotty Character Development then shit yeah, run with it and be joyous. But it's not required.  <b><br /><br />Likes</b> <br />I have a competency-kink a  mile long. It doesn't matter what people are doing specifically,  anything from baking a cake to putting together machinery. I just really  enjoy watching people do things well with assurance and skill. See  also: physical competency, the ability to kick someone's butt etc. :D  <br /><br />Intimacy.&nbsp; I don't just mean sex or physical touch -- that ease you get with&nbsp; someone when you've been together forever, and can hang out in their&nbsp; personal space and never bump into them; all the inside jokes you build&nbsp; up; knowing they're okay or not okay at a glance. That sort of thing.<br /><br />Happy  endings, although I get that they might not always be possible.  If a happy ending doesn't work for your fic,  I'd totally go for  bittersweet 'things are still  fucked, but we're still together and  hanging in there' in its place :D <br /><br /> <b>Dislikes</b> <br />For  Yuletide this year, I'd rather not read rape/non-con. I have a strong  embarrassment/disappointment squick, which mostly manifests in a 'person  gets their hopes up about X, and then gets those hopes squashed or gets  laughed at.' I can deal with it better if, by the end of the fic, the  person has rationalised it as a learning experience/can laugh about it  and generally doesn't feel upset anymore.    <br /><br /><strong>Fandoms:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Caprica</strong> (Sam Adama)       <br />I  love the relationship between Sam and Larry, and the whiplash   difference between Sam being a loving husband, uncle, and general   family member and his job as a brutal Ha'la'tha enforcer  (dark-competency-kin ahoy!). I am mostly all about the domesticity and  the banter, and the affection for each other (see: intimacy :D)<br /><br />I  love the bits of Tauron  culture we see-- the rituals, (the tattoos  especially!), and even the  O.O death-before-dishonour system. If you'd  rather do gen that slash,  I'd love to know the story of one of Sam's  tattoos (more details here:   http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=309547004036)<br /><br /><blockquote title=""prompt"" class=""userstuff summary"">     </blockquote><strong>Bend it like Beckham</strong> (Jess Bhamra, Jules Paxton)       <br />Confession  time: I watched this movie for the first time maybe  two days before  signups opened. Then I realised the movie was nominated,  and stayed the  hell away from the fic. I therefore fear that by saying  &quot;'movie! your  heterosexuality is pastede on, yaye?' Please write me  scenes from the  *original* movie, where they're so obviously pining  after each  other...&quot; is actually like asking you to not only reinvent  the wheel,  but roll it down a road that's worn smooth by a thousand  others just  like it.<br /><br />So, uh, if the fandom is not in fact Done  with writing  tentative, awkward, laughing first times, be that sex,  blosoming  relationship and/or coming out (or staying firmly closeted) I  would  like to read one. *coughs* *toes dirt*<br /><br /><br /><strong>Cyteen </strong>(Justin Warrick,Grant ALX-972)                      <br />I  loved Cyteen and Regenesis, but I'm craving Justin/Grant fic  to round  out the experience for me. The fact that their relationship is  canon  delights my soul, and those little touches (the horrifying note  under  Justin's pillow; the delightful moments in the morning after  Justin  gets back from Playns etc) has left me craving so much more of  it (see  the intimacy-like above :D). They were under so much pressure for so  long and I'd love to see how  they helped each other through. I'm happy  for there to be explicit sex,  fade to black, or no sex at all. Take it  where ever you're comfortable  :)<br /><br />Alternately, I am always, <i>always</i>  up for Catlin and  Florian being competent and awesome. I'd rather they  weren't explicitly a  couple, but if you happen to have a bunny that  includes them being  together, then I'm game :)<br /><br /><br /><strong>Neverwhere </strong>(Serpentine, Hunter)<br />I  love the whole Neverwhere world like crazy. I love all the  characters,  especially the creepy-hilarious-horrifying Mr Vandemar and  Croup, too  (although was saddened by the way Jessica was written).<br /><br />Hunter   mashes ALL my competency/kickass buttons, and I'd adore a fic about her   and Serpentine, as gen or as femslashy as you're comfortable with. Hot   sex, and/or backstory, and/or a 'just' a Bechdel-passing conversation   between two powerful women. :D<br /><br />Alternately, if you ticked Any and   are now kicking yourself for it, I'd be just as delighted with a fic   that was about (other-character!), that included them in the background   :) Or a gen backstory for Hunter, for example.</lj-cut><p>Hopefully that helps! If you've got an idea, but are hesitating, you can send a message to &lt;user name=meghanc&gt; and she can pass on any questions/double-checking. And, really, you're putting words on a page! For me! Anything above that is a bonus! :D Good luck!<br /> <br />&nbsp;</p><br /></lj-cut>"

I just finished ep two, and almost reflexively went and bought its single season on Amazon. The wiki link can tell you plot things. I gave it money for the 'most of the conversations pass the Bechdel test', the matter-of-fact lesbian character, (and the apparent matter-of-fact bisexual character, although I'm waiting with interest to see how that pans out), the friendships, and the snark. The mace/creepy scene tipped it for me :)

And CISPA would provide a victory for content owners who were shell-shocked by the unprecedented outpouring of activism in opposition to SOPA and Internet censorship.

The House of Representatives is planning to take up CISPA later this month. <a href=""http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/cispa/?akid=1306.392739.EBOM7A&amp;rd=1&amp;t=2"">Click here to ask your lawmakers to oppose it.</a>

SOPA was pushed as a remedy to the supposed economic threat of online piracy -- but economic fear-mongering didn&#39;t quite do the trick.

So those concerned about copyright are engaging in sleight of hand, appending their legislation to a bill that most Americans will assume is about keeping them safe from bad guys.

This so-called cyber security bill aims to prevent theft of &quot;government information&quot; and &quot;intellectual property&quot; and could let ISPs block your access to websites -- or the whole Internet.

Don&#39;t let them push this back-door SOPA. <a href=""http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/cispa/?akid=1306.392739.EBOM7A&amp;rd=1&amp;t=2"">Click here to demand that your lawmakers oppose CISPA.</a>

CISPA also encourages companies to share information about you with the government and other corporations.

That data could then be used for just about anything -- from prosecuting crimes to ad placements.

And perhaps worst of all, CISPA supercedes all other online privacy protections.

<a href=""http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/cispa/?akid=1306.392739.EBOM7A&amp;rd=1&amp;t=2"">Please click here to urge your lawmakers to oppose CISPA when it comes up for a vote this month.</a>

[Someone else's letter]: designed for a conservative group of elected officials in until-last-November blue state Wisconsin.  YMMV, but I think it hits them where it counts (the talking point about A Liberal Conspiracy Against Their Re-Election) without getting dirty.  Warning for patriotic hornblowing.

""CISPA would obliterate privacy protections online and let ISPs block Americans' access to websites -- like SOPA in a more insidious and subtle form. This nation was founded on the will of the people, and its first Constitutional Amendment includes measures preserving our right to free speech and peaceful public assembly. It is impossible to ignore the fact that many Americans, including those in high political office, ""assemble"" and ""speak"" on the internet as impactfully as they do in other forums.

""Please vote against CISPA. You'll not only be upholding the will of your constituents, who were among the US majority who protested against SOPA, but protecting the freedoms of voters to come. If you truly feel forces are organized against your candidacy and that they question your motives in office, then you must defend the ability of your supporters to discuss those issues in public without third-party editing. Thank you for your time and attention.""

"event","This was a <em>darling</em> little movie. Visually <em>gorgeous</em>, and the soundtrack was charming. Arrietty is a fantastic little (heh) heroine, a 10cm little person who lives under the floor with her parents, who 'borrow' things from upstairs to make their homes. I grew up on the early 90s Ian Holmes version, and on the original book, so it had some pretty big childhood shoes to fill, and it did it well. It kept the spirit of the original, and spun it out in Ghibi ways that pleased me.<br /><br />I&nbsp;have nit-picks: many of the things in their home were Borrower-sized, rather than visibly appropriated or cut down to size. I was totally charmed by the use of stamps as paintings, though! The gender roles were almost painfully stereotypical, and I&nbsp;feel like with a tiny moment or two you could have established Arrietty's mother's fretting as, say, a completely legitimate response to a really hard and stressful life. Also, subtitliers! Please call SBS and ge them to explain how it's done Properly. :P But these are comparatively tiny things. <br /><br />I was delighted by the details <em>everywhere</em>, and how fearless and curious Arrietty was. I was struck by having a female protagonist, an actual point-of-view character, and how many of Ghibi's films do this, and how Pixar is only <em>just</em> getting around to it. I was also struck by the fact that there was actually two early-20s guys sitting behind us, and they seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. It's the little things!<br /><br />Also, my new 'if I&nbsp;won lotto' dream is to pay Valve to make a Portal-2-quality-graphics Borrowers game. Seriously! A tiny little third-person-character, creeping around a giant-sized house, looking for things to complete their home and combining 'borrowed' items to make X, which would get you into room Y, which would enable you to... etc *cough*<br /><br />In sum: <em>Arrietty</em> was wonderful. I recommend it :)<br /><br />"

Although that is also waiting on the movers bringing beds and desks and the like over tomorrow. (YAY movers omg!), and the like. Hence the couch sleeping tonight.<br /><br />ETA: Mostly for myself, to remind future-me that tense thighs and soreness do have consequences, and that I should foam roller more, and massage in the shower. I'd been having sore and tense thigh muscles for a few weeks, and dashing uphill yesterday to catch the bus finally made my left thigh go 'no, no more' and tug on my kneecap. It wasn't as bad as it's been in the past, but it was enough to make me carefully hobble-canter the rest of the distance, and this morning, when I got up and felt the twinging and the way I was instinctively moving my leg to not move my knee, I personed up and called the physio and asked if I could be squeezed in for an emergency knee taping because moving today, omg!

Hello!

omg you're writing me Losers fic! I'm just going to take a moment to glee over that. :D

Losers is one of those fandoms that I love to read fic in, but I usually hit a wall when it comes to thinking up fic I'd want to write. If you just happen to have an Epic Plot with a side serving of Jensen/Cougar and/or any of the canon pairings, allow me to give you the detonator and get out of your way so you can blow this out of the water :D.

If, on the other hand, you're thinking 'plot? um, they have to <i>do</i> things? ohshit,' I'd equally be delighted with a thousand and one words of, say, Jensen/Cougar or canon pairing PWP, or hurt/comfort post-mission patch-up, or banter and bonding snark on whatever passes for a Losers' lazy Sunday afternoon.

If you're after pointers:
Things I love: 
- that repressed manly love thing where they'd jump off cliffs for each other, worry when one of them is badly injured, and never ever be able to say the words 'I love you'.
- Military and/or physical competency: being supremely fit, or being able to strip down a rifle in three seconds flat, or Jensen being able to hack [insert high-security database here], Aisha ... pretty much doing anything *cough*. People being generally badass.

Things I'm cool with: to steal and paraphrase from someone's request last year: ""I'm cool with banter, D/s themes, violence, non-con, humour...""

Things I'm not so cool on:
- I have a major embarrassment squick. Other than that, not so big on mpreg, deathfics and that's all I can think of.

If you want any more pointers, or want to double-check something, I imagine you can safely anonymously comment to either DW or LJ, or email <span lj:user='kate' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://kate.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://kate.dreamwidth.org/'><b>kate</b></a></span>.

Best of luck, and have a fantastic time :D"

Tonight I have: washed my sheets! hung out my sheets! changed my sheets to pretty, pretty summer blue sheets! and cut my toe nails. For some reason, all of these things are weighted equally in my head.

Also, I love this more than I can properly articulate; it almost makes me cry from the happy.

"event","Confusion and gnashing of teeth 1: Adblock is failing me! I have moving, flashing things in the corner of my vision in Yahoo and there are ads in Facebook and all these places they weren't before. I've tried reinstalling adblock and restarting firefox, to no avail. Has anyone else had this problem> Any ideas on how to fix it?

Angst 2!: I want a smartphone. I'm very much liking the look of the <a href=""http://www.htc.com/www/product/desire/specification.html"">HTC Desire</a>.

Things I'm after in a (smart)phone:
 - ability to make calls, text (with threads!), and take photos
 - a good calendar, with a weekly-ish view of what I'm doing
 - ability to use GPS and maps while on foot
 - good browsing ability for blogging sites (LJ! DW, oh how I miss you!)
 - potential ability to read e-books
 - ability to listen to (and store) music

I'm pretty sure iPhone and Android both do these things admirably. Just that the android OS looks <i>pretty</i> and seems to be slightly cheaper, depending. I'm not deep about this. If there's something in that list that Android doesn't do well, shout out.

Angst the 3rd: what carrier should I go with? I'm currently pre-paid just-phone-no-internet with 3 on a $29 cap. Which... I resent paying $29 every month after Virgin's $50 'yeah, use it whenever,it's cool', but it works for me just fine, other than that. <span  lj:user='samvara' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://samvara.dreamwidth.org/'><b>samvara</b></a></span> has mentioned the roaming rates that kick in for internet (they kick in for my phone, too, but only when I'm using it, and even then I've never spent more than the cap's worth). So I'm wary of that.

The best deal I've found so far is <a href=""http://shop.vodafone.com.au/mobile-details/HTC-Desire-HD"">this one</a> from Vodafone: $50 a month for a two year contract: 1 GB of data, unlimited this, unlimited that. Only thing I'd want to double check is if they really, really did international texts. Pro column: 3 and Vodafone are completing a merger. They'll be delighted to swap me over, says <user name=""samvara>. Con column: their service has been up and down because they're... upgrading things? doing hardware things? I'm not too clear.

Can anyone advise? Who are you with, carrier wise? What do you think of them? Aid the confused!"

"event","Dad and I went 'down south' this long weekend, which is short hand in our family for heading for Margaret River, to the house that my parents built on a bush block. It was a wonderfully peaceful weekend. Photos below the cut!

<lj-cut text=""Photos in approximate order of events..."">

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5505490125/"" title=""1 We're off by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5177/5505490125_0706bedc4b.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""361"" alt=""1 We're off"" /></a>
An appropriate licence plate spotted on the way down.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506082400/"" title=""2 Knitting spot by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5055/5506082400_8067798d79.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""2 Knitting spot"" /></a>
I had grand plans of spending many hours knitting here (note the wonderful pattern by <span  lj:user='meghanc' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://meghanc.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://meghanc.dreamwidth.org/'><b>meghanc</b></a></span>, but got beset by waves of tired all weekend. I did get the toe done, though, so it's completely ready for train knitting. Anyway, that's the view from the house's porch. There's a birdbath just below the line of sight, and little birds come and hang out around it in the evenings and early mornings.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5505487031/"" title=""3 Wndchimes by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5295/5505487031_7b67b14cbc.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""3 Wndchimes"" /></a>
The windchimes above the table that sent gently resonating, single notes out into the air.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506086336/"" title=""4 Sunset by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5017/5506086336_4bedb39a13.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""4 Sunset"" /></a>
This photo sadly doesn't capture anywhere near the gorgeousness of the evening, but it's something.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5505489777/"" title=""5 Possum by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5505489777_966cb9955d.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""5 Possum"" /></a>
Possum! She lives in the wall of one side of the house, I think, although Dad's possum-proofed the rest of it, and given her a nesting box. She'll sit on your lap, and is remarkably lighter than a cat, although I was too unnerved by the biting-after-you-ran-out-of-food to let her do it for long. Hello, wild animal...

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506292836/"" title=""6 60 second stars by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5506292836_bf0b387d52.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""6 60 second stars"" /></a>
This is pale, pale attempt to capture the <i>amazing</i> number of stars in the sky. I'd forgotten how amazing the 'true' night sky is without light pollution, my god. This was a 60 second exposure, lying my camera on a flat surface and using the 'starry night' setting.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506295588/"" title=""6-1 Prevelly Beach by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5177/5506295588_340cbd3df7.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""6-1 Prevelly Beach"" /></a>
The next morning, we went out to Prevelly (sp?) beach for a coffee and a swim in Dad's case, and a mocha and a wade for me. This was our view from our cafe seats.

There was what turned out to be an uncle giving his niece and nephew a surfing lesson. They paddled up and down the beach, and then got the standing up lesson on the sand, and then back out for the standing-for-reals-on-the-water, and they both managed it. They were *adorable*.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506297146/"" title=""8 Wavelets by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5298/5506297146_3853ae414c.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""8 Wavelets"" /></a>
Beautiful water patterns in the sun.

Then post beach, we went shopping for various things (new sheets! whee!) including sandpaper and extra brushes, came back and sanded and varnished the picnic bench that friends had given Mum & Dad for their 40th birthday. After knitting and tugging a ball of yarn over such a rough surface, plus remembering how awesome it was to varnish my floorboards, I wanted to give it a go.

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506303416/"" title=""10 Pre-work table by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5058/5506303416_0802683b80.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""10 Pre-work table"" /></a>

After!

On Sunday, we went out to the Karri forest, which is so pretty you get two photos of the trees:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5505711103/"" title=""12 Beautiful Karris by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5056/5505711103_701d8b15de.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""12 Beautiful Karris"" /></a>

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5505714891/"" title=""13 Beautiful Karris by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5505714891_399a948662.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""13 Beautiful Karris"" /></a>

</lj-cut>

This is so cool, I'm placing it outside the cut so that people who aren't interested in my holiday can still see the omg! HART!

This is one of the signs along that stretch of road, warning drivers that people are likely to be crossing the road to admire the gorgeous trees. An example of the standard sign is <a href=""http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/5557648/2/istockphoto_5557648-aged-people-sign.jpg"">here</a> (insert gender role and representation snarl here. Plus, 'aged people'? says who?) Anyway, this is the magic someone/s performed on one of the signs:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/maharetr/5506316148/"" title=""14 Pixies sign! by maharetr, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5131/5506316148_413d0443be.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""14 Pixies sign!"" /></a>

I really, really want to meet these person/people and buy them a drink, and learn what else they've done.

<lj-cut text=""Sunday evening was the Aust short film fest""> They showed (all?) 16 short films over a few hours at a winery, with a decent cover band before things kicked off at 8pm. I'm... glad I went, and they were all technically ranging from solid to really good, but I was left wondering if it was possible to do a short film that was uplifting or kind or life-affirming, because a few came close, but many of them were grim and one or two were downright nasty. (My favourites were Flight(?) and Things To Do).

And then Monday we drove back. We left at noon, which was a Mistake -- we were stop-starting bumper to bumper in several places. Next time, leaving to go home at 9am, as well as leaving-to-get-down-there at 9am.</lj-cut>"

<i>Lara Giddings is set to become the first female Tasmanian premier, after David Bartlett announced he was standing down.

The Prime Minister has congratulated Ms Giddings on her likely rise to become premier, with Mr Bartlett saying he felt he could not be a good father to his children in his current role.</i>

*has a Moment*

This, combined with the realisation that apparently my co-workers are returning tomorrow, is making for a weird, delightful Monday."

She's been doing most of the watering (thank you!), and gave me dynamic lifter to add to the pot when I replanted it, which means it's not only still alive, but it's flourishing! I didn't measure it when we first got it, but it's now 43 cm and growing.

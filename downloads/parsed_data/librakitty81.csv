"event","Well, I started my job today...same shit different place.

Someone at WBI gave me a very good reference, because they created a job so they could hire me. Then, they gave me the job that was my ideal position. I work residential girls unit in the evenings. That was what I told them that I wanted and they just gave it to me. Pretty fucking cool if you ask me. Although, I don't blame them, I'm very good at my job. 

When I was working and people asked me where I was from, I told them Wyoming. The faces were so cool to look at when I told them that. They just looked shocked, and surprised. One lady looked at me and said ""Where is that?"" What a great experience.

Everything else is fan'fucking'tastic. I'm glad to be working again, I was getting very bored. I got so bored that I was using my takedown procedure on Lea, it was fun...she hated it of course.

I have tomorrow off, so TWAK MART here we come. I'm going to buy blackout blinds so I can have a third story basement. That's what I get for living in a basement forever.

So long my pretties, and your little dog too!!!!!----From Kansas...City..in Missouri."

I'm what you call a 'floater'(no, not in a toliet) what I do is go around in the hospital to different units, being a helpful person on the units. I love the float position, it's fun, because you don't just work on one unit, you are everywhere. Plus, you always get called to the physical takedowns. 

I got my physical shit done, the crazy RN, had to stab me twice, and then blamed it on me that she missed the first vein. Whatever, maybe you should get better at your job. I know that not every RN can be as good as my Dad was, but geez how hard can it be to take blood.

Anyhow, shit is good. Lea is having some woman troubles, so I think we are going to go bar hopping tonight.

Love and miss most of you!!!!

"event","Well, I have one day in this god forsaken hell hole left.
I am so glad that I'm leaving. No more of the same people, no more of the same bullshit. You know it's bad when a town makes you want to drink. It takes all my energy not to sit in a bar in this town, and just start drinking. I just want the days to go by quicker, and so I'm not so irritable with everything and I won't kill everyone. These days have been bad, I'm very quick to blow my top and just start yelling at or beating on something or someone. I just need to chill the fuck out, and not be so ready to pounce.

I have decided that no longer will I ever hangout or be civil to anyone I absolutly despise. I cannot pretend anymore that I can tolerate them, when in fact, I hate them!!!! Maybe someday that will change, but for now it's the way things have to be so I don't beat the shit out of them.

Anyhow, good news: I think I already have a job doing the same thing I have been doing for the past year. I think Lea and I have a 2 bedroom and 2 bath apt. that  we are going to rent. Thank god for the 2 bath, I really don't want to share a bathroom with a girl right now. I don't want to share anything with a girl right now. I hate girls!!!! That won't last for long, but it works for right now.

I have noticed that since I handed in my letter of resignation, I have become almost kinda worthless at work. I show up, because I'm a body, I do the bare minimum of work, and my charting sucks. Sounds like I'm quitting. 

Everything is slowly getting better regarding me, life, and the will to keep going. I have actual hope for my future now. I don't feel the horrible hand choking the life out of me anymore. I actually feel the need to live.

Regarding Delirium: I think I have lived in the state of delirium for the past 3 weeks. Last night is when I actually felt the pure madness of living in this state for to long. I do believe that I was actually crazy last night. So, when my co-workeers wanted me to go out and play, I turned them down. I went home and decided that enough was enough, I WAS GETTING MORE THEN 4 HOURS OF SLEEP THAT NIGHT. Which I recieved 9 hours of sleep last night, and I feel like a new person, and I can go to work with more then an ""I don't care attitude."" 

Agenda: 
1. Quitting my job Jul. 18th
2. Pack quickly in a week and a half.
3. Leave for Texas on Jul. 28th.
4. Fly in from Texas to Denver Aug. 1st
5. Pick up Lea the same day at the airport.
6. Drive back quickly.
7. Go to Frank's B-day party Aug. 1st.
8. Finish up things here.
9. Leave for K.C. on Aug. 4th

10. Have a good rest of the year/life."

I have come to the conclusion that I miss my dad. I miss calling him up and telling him I'm sick, and asking him ""What should I do?""  I always knew what to do when I was sick, but it felt good to have him tell me what to do. I think he got a personal joy out of telling me what to do when I was sick. I think it might have been the only time he actually felt like he contributed to being a father. Or vice versa?

Anyhow, talked to Lea last night. She is doing absolutely fabulous in K.C. I guess she's making the money, and then spending the money on cool, little, sexy outfits. She is meeting all kinds of people and having all kinds of fun.  Yet she misses me...they always do. LOL

Do remember when I chased you around my own neighborhood. Your very lucky I wasn't use to my neighborhood. I lost you....that had to be a sign. I wouldn't change a moment of my existance with you.

I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!

I have met the most incredible people in my adventures. I wouldn't change a moment...I might change the moments when I got beat up by the bastards that decided that I was thier's to keep.

I love my life!!!!!!!!!! 

I'm glad I'm not that big of a grudge holder....only to some do I hold grudges....the ones that really tried to fuck me over....I know that a lot of them have tried to make me hate them, but I don't.  I don't think I would have that many friends/aquaintances(sp?) if I hated everyone that tried to control me or ruin me.

Loving most of you!!!!!!!!!!!"

Then its off to the glorious Avalon to laugh at the crack heads and drink beer, and most importantly protect my girlfriend from the crack heads. We will have a 3 man bouncer/hitman squad...The mouth, the brawn, the intellectual and together we will kick your ass. Did I ever mention how bad I want to be a superhero?

I wonder what happened to my dear friend Lea?  I guess she no longer is an addict to the internet. Good for you, it was scary there for awhile.

I guess I should mention for those who care...I got another tattoo...I got the constellation Orion on my forearm.  That makes 12."

"event","I love the feeling of having 3 days off. This means I have 3 days in which I don't have to deal with blood squirting around a room, or cutting a shoestring from someones neck, or even cutting someone down from a shower rod. This job is definently not for the squemish. Although I do love my job, I'm always glad to go back to my safety net of ""Sanity.""  It's awfully scary to think that you once were the person trying to hang themself or trying to OD on Alcohol and Codeine. I need to try to never lose that part of me, so I can always remember ""how bad living actually felt at times."" I think it makes my job easier to deal with or maybe I'm just hopeful.

Anyhow, here is to 3 days off from work, and to those ""poor bastards"" who get to work for these next 3 days.

Love and miss most of you."

I have started this thing called RIPPED FUEL, its great it just makes me very thirsty. I actually found out about ripped fuel from Amber. I remember her dosing up on it before she went to work at JDC. Now I dose up on it before I go to WBI.  

Anyhow, life is fun. I think Shana's mom is a little nuts, but thats my own personal assessment. She keeps on complaining about our grass needing mowed...WHAT GRASS!!! She came over about 11:20am, and was freaking out about the grass needing watered too...Again....WHAT GRASS!?!?! So, she started up the sprinkler and is watering Crab grass, weeds, dirt, and my truck.

YAYY, I think I found someone to take my evening shift on Sunday...YAYYY...3 days off.

I'm Hungry..its time for daily feeding.

Why haven't I heard from my Lea...I miss that girl."

So, it has been awhile since I've posted, but I had no computer until today. Yukon is really excited too!!!  So, life has been pretty darn busy..moving, working, partying, playing. My b-day kicked ass..I got my ass completely wasted **I miss my DD** The amazing thing is that Frank was the DD for the first time...I'm so impressed it's scary.

On to B-day presents...My favorite fairy..got me a pair of horns which kick ass, because I always needed a pair of horns. My favorite girfriend got me a bunch of stuff although the cool present was a present from a store called Necroman in Hollywood....its a human finger bone(owner unknown)and a bunch of human bone beads(owners unknown).....I'm going to make the coolest fucking necklace out of both of them....YAYYYY!!!!! for me!

Work has been a fucking bitch and half...That's all about that.

Shana's all excited, she's running around thinking about what she should decorate each room with (colors, patterns, moons, stars, Hello Kitty). I just figure I'll let her just do it, I'm pretty much happy with anything. There was one thing I wouldn't let her do, and that was decorate the bedroom in PINK. I don't think I could sleep in PINK. Yea, I'm not a big fan of the color pink. PINK MAKES ME PUKE! I'm terribly sorry baby. I still love you.

I had a very creepy dream last night, it was about the movie House of a Thousand Corpses. I don't know why I just started dreaming about that, I saw the movie about 3 or 4 months ago. Anyhow, that was creepy.

Have I mentioned how much I love the month of October..probably only to friends. Not only is my b-day in that month, but cool scary movies come out(movies that I can't go and see with my gf, cause she gets to squeamish), AMC has cool, old horror flicks on, and my favorite holiday falls in the month of October. Oh my god I love this month!!!!!

Well, this is all I have to talk about. My words ran out.

"event","Well, for my last day off it was just ok. Got up around 2:30 or 3:00 not to sure which one it was. Visited with my mom, received some kick ass presents from her movie star trip. Then Shana and I went shopping...shopping is fun when you feel better then par. My foot was ""acting up"", the DR. said it would ""act up"" from time to time. Shana had the big C's. I don't think shopping was probably the best medicine for both of us. We got some pretty cool shit though. Then we went back to her place, and just chilled. I took her to work at 9:00 or so. Now I'm here **looking around** with two pussies. Which are cats, don't get the wrong idea.

I'm moving on Tuesday to our house. I'm wondering how the pussies and the dog are going to be about this whole living together thing? Zoe is curious but cautious. Eros is just freaked the fucked out, Eros actually went after Yukon last night. It was a huge riot to see this 20lb. cat take off after this 200lb. dog. I laughed my ass off. Zoe freaked Yukon out so bad that Yukon climbed up in my lap. So, here I am with this puffed up little cat, and this big Great Dane dog shaking in my lap, cause he's so scared. That was worth a picture, but i couldn't take a picture because I had a 200lb. dog on me.

My uncle called me tonight. We chatted about his recovery, my step-mom, my grandpa, my dad, his boyfriend, my job, my b-day, my girlfriend, and antiques. It was a good chat, he is suppose to call me on Wednesday to get my new address, cause I couldn't remember it. Ohhh... he wants to hear the letter that my evil Stepmom wrote to me too. 

Here's a Question: Is she still my stepmom if my dad is dead? I don't know.

My birthday is next Sunday, I have the 4th, 5th, 6th, and the 7th off. How I accomplished that I don't know.

Well that's all from me. Hope you all are having absolutly fabulous times."

I love waking up at 2 in the afternoon next to my girlfriend, knowing I don't have to be at work in one hour. That is the best thing in the entire world. I think snuggling is one of the best things ever thought of to do. I love snuggling. I love my girlfriend.

I think for my b-day present to myself I'm going to go and get some tattoos. I need some more ink. I love getting tattoos, thats another great thing in this world.

So she deleted my comment. What I said in was this:
Jen, I told you once that I Angie cheated on me, but
that was at the very beginning of are relationship.
Then you come in and start telling me that you saw and
heard angie cheated on me. Then I told her Angie knows
how you work so don't blame this in me. This must be
you you did to our relationship and now your're doing
it to angie and shana's so don't be bringing me into
this. I have nothing to do with whats going on right
now. 
If I was angie I would be pissed at you right now too
just stay out of peoples relationships.


you were right jen sucks she does try to mess up
relationships by saying shit. this is the second time
she has done this to you. I'm sorry angie!!

See I told MYSELF that Jennifer was a dirty fucking liar.
GOD get a fucking life and leave mine alone."

On to different business: Last time I checked I'm not killing my relationship with Shana by hating a certain Jennifer. Shana hasn't given the ring back, yet. Plus, let me take a big old nasty SNIFF...nope my head is not up my ass. However, I do smell pussy...Yummy and very Tasty. Speaking of tasty pussy, you know what I love most about Shana???? (NOTE: rhetorical question here, folks) Not a single time has she passed the fuck out while we're having sex!!! It's incredible what a little reciprocation and some enthusiasm will do for one's sex life. YAY for Angie!!!   Speaking of the magic number 59... Yes, 59, not 69. Please, oh please, don't ask. Your new found thoughts of inadequacy will haunt you for the rest of your life.

Another less exciting thing in my life...I see that Jen once again is ""targeting"" my girlfriend. I would honestly like to know why out of all the people in this world Jen only seems to go for my girlfriends? The big difference about this gf is that she is smart enough not to listen to a damn word that Jen has to say about me.  Anyhow, that topic has long since been a dead issue with me.

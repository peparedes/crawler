When one good think is going to happen, something always has to swoop down and fuck it up. I'm extremely tired, Ive had a long day. Had to hang out with the ""fam"". Step siblings are the worst.

So it turns out one of my friends sort of lied to me... Not about anything major, but about something important. 

I'm tired, sleep is good.

Part of me feels like I dont have a place here right now. Does that make sense to anyone out there? I feel like I'm trapped in this same god damn spot. I don't really hang out with much of my friends anymore, I guess I'm just busy, their busy, everyone is I guess.

I'm home alone right now, Katie and Russel just went over to Lisas bday party. Another party I wasnt invited to because I'm too young. Should that really matter? I guess they dont really stop and think how it makes me feel. It makes me feel like I'm sort of a ""there kind of friend"" Does that make sense? I feel like they look at me like I'm just someone to talk to, sort of a last resort. It sucks ya know? 

I hate this, I hate feeling like this. I feel really lonely, and I'm really up and down right now. I should go on anti-depressents or something, that might help right? I don't know I give up. I don't know what to do with myself to keep my mind busy. Its like I'm home alone and I pick out every flaw in my life right now. Ugh, I'm gonna go now."

So this morning I went to my first block. 20 or 30 mins into it i went to the bathroom and cried. And then I tried to call my mother; who didnt answer her phone. So I went home. And then when she finally got my messages, she proceeded to lecture me on my school work, and how its important, and bla bla bla! Jesus christ. So now shes like lets talk when I get home. AHHH I FUCKING HATE THIS. Im sick of it. 

And Eric pissed me off today. He has this tendancy to interupt me constenly, and so I just decided not to talk.

Sorry somethin in my throat. haha But I addmit it, he does! *Looks over shoulder* Um what else is new... I think about nothing. Except my slut of an english teacher assigned us a fucking essay over the weekend. But I dont really give a rats ass because I finished it. I think I hurt my moms feelings, she wasnt supposed to see my essay, but it was mainly about my father. So um yes. Cat, Kris, we should hang out this weekend, cuz its gonna be pretty boring! Ok... Ya. I have nothing to say, except this clartion D makes me feel high and gives me a craaaazy little buz, and makes me feel stupid and stuff. Ok Im going to go do something and stuff. What is there to do in longmont? NOTHING! Freak I hate this town. Ok I am leaving. Peace in the middle east my friends, peace!

Cranky=I havent had my coffee today, and Im tired and I want it<br>
Depressed= Ugh... How do I explain?<br>
Tired= One of those days.<br>
Jealous= Here we go. I went to a wedding tonight and I see all of these
happy couples and Im just sad and sort of jealous that I cant have
that... Im honestly starting to believe&nbsp; that there isnt that
""one"" person out there for me. I just dont want to be alone anymore. Im
terrified of dying alone, being alone. bla. Theres other things to
worry about.<br>
Crazy= Im in a mood where Im happy but Im depressed. Tonight a bunch of
the guys were picking on me and&nbsp; I was laughing, and then I went
outside to smoke and almost burst into tears. <br>
<br>
Im tired of holding back my real feelings. Im sick of Colin being an
asshole. I know hes joking but it honestly gets to me. With some of the
things he says I just think... I wonder how many other people think
that. It makes me sad and I dont know. <br>
Im going to burn a cd, and then go to sleep. Ill update soon.<br>"

"event","Ok. So my trip was good, just kinda long, and too much family. I missed Katie, and I still miss her. Should I explain? Im home, I hung out with her today, but I miss her because I know its not going to last. Great huh? Um. About that guy who likes me but wont date me cuz I smoke. I dont think I want a guy that wont take me for me. I know it sounds selfish, but Ive been taken just the way I am before, Ive been with a guy who doesnt smoke and he didnt get anal about my smoking. So ya. Im just afraid if its that whats next? I dont like your piercings, I dont like your friends, you know what I just dont like you! Im being childish, I KNOW!!! But Im not changing for anyone anytime soon. Caitlin mentioned a few things today that just made me think, guess what Cat, Im still thinking. ARRRGHH. Im not mad that she told me, Im just frusterated that the subject was brought up again. Because we all know its sort of a touchy subject. Um what else. Oh ya IM FUCKING DEPRESSED. GOD it felt good to get that out. So Caitlin, Shera, and I went to Boulder today. And everything I saw, everything I heard made me sick. I feel like Im gonna cry over nothing. Its the whole Katie thing. It sucks, its a great start to a new year. Im not shitting you either. This hurts so much. ::Confession:: I cried myself to sleep last night because I thought of it being two people in my house instead of three. I cried and cried. And normally it makes me feel better. It didnt, it made me want to cry again. To top off Katie leaving, schools starting, so Im nice and stressed, and Im sick, and my alergies wont go away. Many other things to top it off. Shall I name one thing in peticular?? ugh how do I explain this? Plain and simple, my x. Its not bad, hes not being an asshole, its just he was brought up and it made me think. And its just annoying, because Ive never had a problem like this... (Not that hes a problem) God I cant even fucking explain it. Im gonna go. Ill write later."

"event","Oi. So its been a bit since I last wrote. Ive just been kind of crazy. Im having a people over-load actually. Not to be mean to any of my friends but Im just sick of people. But ok so whats new... I went to ozzfest. It was absolutley fabulous... Slipknot was fun, but I almost died. I lost a pack of smokes and my brand new lighter *whines*, and my shoe fell off, but i kept it on some how! And then I was falling and I guess some guy caught me, funny because I thought my sister (Katie) caught me, but it was some randome guy.. *Thanks random guy*. And then we finally decided that we had to get out of that pit and i guess my chest was up against some guy and he taps me on my shoulder and I looked up (may I add he was HOT) and smiles at me. It was embaressing. But um ya. OI! I got a new shirt that I thought was Slipknot... woohoo stupid me. But on the back it says fuck you forever. ME LIKIE! But I dont know I downloaded a song from the band ""bleeding through"" Their actually pretty decent. I dont care if their emo/screamo. I kinda like em *nods!* And Oh my gosh... Hate Breed was aweeeeesome! Im half tempted to go buy their cd... But Im broke... And I have to save money for my cruise.... OH YES! Im going on a cruise to the carribeans (or however you spell that). For like a week! no 8 days!! Im excited. And Its going to be Winter, Russel, Dad, and myself! And  Winter and I get our own room so like were gonna go clubbing. IM so siked!!!!!! I cant wait. And like 3 days after I get back Katies leaving for the Navy... Im gonna cry, and Im going to have to deal with my mothe crying for like a month. Its going to be hell. And you know what really sucks. Right when Katie and I are just getting along great, and Im starting to look at her more like a best friend rather than a mean older sister, she leaves. Its really gonna suck. Because I go to her when I have a problem and she helps me, she gives me advice and makes me feel like SO much better... Oi but I will live. Im just gonna be pretty grumpy and in a really shitty mood for a while. But I shall go on. Ok Im off Im sick of typing. BYE BYE!!! have a fun night everyone!

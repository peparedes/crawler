"event","I think my crazy old lady downstairs neighbour is trying to torture me by playing xmas songs over and and over again with her electric piano in organ mode.  She woke me up with silent night this morning before 9 am.  Before 9 is way too early for a song like that.  I'm trying to drown it out with R&B, but I don't want to wake other neighbours up so it's not quite loud enough to drown out the horrible fake organ strains of silent night.  She like to play the same song over and over before moving on to the next one, so silents night for an half an hour, here come santa clause for another half hour etc.  I'm very tempted to slam down very dissonant chords on my piano (which I believe is right above her electric piano.  This was not a good way to wake up."

"event","So it wasn't the first concert I ever went to, but the first concert I ever remember going to was Michael Jackson.  I was a kid; in elementary school.  It was the late 80s and like all the other kids I loved Michael Jackson.   My mother managed to get us amazing seats (7th row center) so when he flew over the audience, he flew over us.  For a long time no concerts seemed live up to that, even after I wanted to no longer like him.  He was a very gifted musician.  

Then he became very, very odd.  So no one wanted to like him, but I think we were all secretly fascinated by him.

Even though he was a mess, and didn't seem to be making new music, it is a sad day."

"event","That man's approval rating is now down to 26%, with a 65% disapproval rating.  Yet congress still continues to do nothing about him, and they wonder why their approval ratings are even lower.

This man should be impeached.  I'm aware (assuming things go as they're supposed to in November '08) that he only has a year and half left in office, however he should be impeached, not doing it sends the signal that these things are ok, and possibly encourages future presidents to do the same or worse.  

Here a few reasons (in no particular order) he should be impeached:

1) Deliberately lying to the public about WMDs in Iraq leading up to the Iraq war.

2) Illegal Wiretapping of US citizens.

3) Violating civil liberties of americans.

4) Abuse of executive power and privilege.

5) Violating the Geneva Convention, thus committing war crimes.

6) Torture.

There are other reasons I didn't mention here and several other grossly incompetent things he's done that I'm not sure are actually grounds for impeachment (ie Katrina, Immigration, encouraging the Saddam Osama false connection).

It's time."

"event","I watched the Last King of Scotland last night, it was a very good film, and Forrest Whitaker was truly brilliant and definitely deserved that oscar.  
However, one thing struck me about it, why does Hollywood feel it necessary to have a white main character in almost every film about Africa; effectively filtering it through a white man's perspective?"

It did snow, but very, very lightly and didn't stick, so it was like a week without snow.  Now it seems to be back to the pattern of snowing every week."

"event","I need computer advice for buying a computer.  I'm going to need to buy a new computer when I get to Denver, and find a place to live, and since I really don't keep up with computers I really don't know what I need to get, so if anyone could give me advice, also about brands and stuff (like how much memory and all that jazz) I'd appreciate it.  Basically I use the internet and email, sometimes I use ms word (and if I go back to Uni that will be a lot).  I really don't play games (I liked the Sims for a while, but then I got bored with it), so I don't think I need anything really powerful or anything like that.  Price is a big factor for me.  I basically need to be able to put the computer on some sort of payment plan for this reason.  I do plan on paying it off as soon as I've saved enough money.  I'll probably have a cable modem for internet.  I was looking at the Dell website earlier (because they allow payment plans and every office I temp in has Dells, so I thought they can't be too bad), I'm not sure that they're as much of a good deal as they seemed because of several things.  They don't come with office, so you have to pay US$150 extra for that (and that's the basic one without powerpoint).  They also only seem to come with 90 day warranties (without paying extra and that's usually a scam) and that seems kind of lame to me.  I also am not sure laptop or desk top, I don't know how much space I'll have and not having to get some computer desk would be nice either way, but cost...  I also think about macs, but I think they might be too expensive.  Although maybe not when you add the cost of things like office, which macs come with.  I do have a copy of Office 97, but it's burned so I don't know how well it works and it's out of date anyway.  I also have a (legal, real) copy of windows xp.  I don't know what else to say right now.  But if anyone can help me with this I'd really appreciate it.  You can reply here or email me at adriarh at gmail.com.
Thanks"

"event","Well, it's official, I'm moving to Denver in June.  I never heard anything from any of the scholarships I applied for so going to NY to finish my degree is out.  So I decided to move back to Denver.  It seems like it should be a good place to save money now, so I can travel or whatever (and I think whatever probably means travel).  I'm really going to miss the weather and beaches here.  I'm absolutely dreading winter.  I hate cold, always have ever since I first remember experiencing it at the age of 8 (I lived in Bangkok before that), and also because I'm a ridiculous person I have a tendency to do things like wear 3"" heels in the winter (in snow or ice even) along with multiple scarfs and nice looking, but not particularly suitable hats, well I also wear 3"" heels in summer, but that's not ice.  I haven't experienced cold weather in years (some things I think are cold, but no one normal does).  So it's off to Denver I'll be going.  It will be nice to live in the same city as my closest friend again, and a bigger city than here, with a much larger jewish community.  
I've been dreaming a lot about traveling recently, lots of different things, I've been dreaming a lot about India (especially Varanasi, but other places too), I've also been dreaming about SE Asia, and also about places that I've never been like the interior of Africa and central America.  I don't know what this means, but I've been having at least one travel dream a night for about the past month or so (and normally I don't even remember many dreams, but these have been very vivid).  Maybe it means my wanderlust is back (although it never really left, and unfortunately I don't have the money to sate it).
I haven't written anything here in a while so I thought I'd write this."

"event","Something really, really freaky happened at the place where I'm temping today.  I can't get the image out of my head.  I'm the receptionist at this place and I went into one of the partner's offices to get his outbox stuff and right as I picked it up his chair turned a bit (he was facing away from me) and then he started making this really strange noise (like something between a wheeze and a pain moan) and then he started collapsing really slowly but his arm and hand were up but limp and sort of looked like someone with severe cerebral palsy, and the collapse was slow and almost in slow motion while the noise got louder.  As soon as I realised what was happening I yelled for his wife (also a partner and in the next office) and then called 911.  Their children were there today (and they ran in too, so they saw their dad like that).  I thought at the time that I was watching a man die.  I thought maybe it was a stroke or a seizure.  The paramedics said it was a seizure, but the doctor later called to ask me what I saw.  He was completely non-responsive (but breathing and all), and seemed to have no awareness (his eyes weren't focused and his face was blank), I guess he started to come around a little and at least recognizes his wife.  I haven't heard anything else.  I really hope he's ok, he's a nice guy and the most easy-going and likable of the partners.  He's in his 40s and seems really healthy and so this seems really unexpected...I don't know it's really just freaky.  I also had felt some weird compulsion to check the out boxes then.  I had checked the one for the senior partner and then was doing something else then I felt like I should go check the others.  It was really strange and I can't get this image out of my head and I really hope this guy is ok."

"event","I have this idea to make a post naming some books or authors that I like (and don't like) and asking people to recommend books to me.  I suppose I'll start off by saying that the writing is the most important thing to me in determining whether I like a book, character is more important to me than plot is, although I don't want to read something with a terrible plot, sometimes books without much of a plot work well.  I also don't mind (actually I kind of like) ambiguities in endings etc.  I don't read very much ""genre"" fiction.  I don't have anything against it, I just haven't liked most of what I've read.  I don't believe books should necessarily make me think, but I don't mind if they do.  I'll start off with playwrights and poets and then go on to novelists and short story authors.  I suppose I'll make it a list for easier reading.

Playwrights and poets:
I like absurdist plays.
Samuel Beckett
Tom Stoppard 
Edward Albee (I love _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_ by Stoppard and _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf_ by Albee)
Some of the existentialists (_No Exit_ by Sartre despite his misogyny).  
_Wit_ by Margaret Edson 
Tennessee Williams (some of it)  
Antonin Artaud,
Bertold Brecht
Christopher Durang
Shakespeare (of course) 
some of the greek tragedies and comedies (my favorite of those must be _The Trojan Women_).  
I find Ibsen to be incredibly boring.  
For poets I prefer modern, I like ""language"" and abstract poets, ee cummings comes to mind, and of course Rilke.  I'm not a big fan of more traditional poetry.

Novelists and short story authors:
My favorite newly discovered author (while I was India, so I guess it's not that recent) is Ben Okri, I think _The Famished Road_ is absolutely brilliant, for magic realism I like Okri better than Garcia-Marquez (whom I also adore).  
Joyce Carol Oates (particularly her more twisted short story collections) 
Margaret Atwood 
Colette 
Virginia Woolf 
Bernard Malamud 
Isaac Singer (at least the short stories which is all I've read) 
Tom Robbins (especially _Jitterbug Perfume_) 
Kurt Vonnegut
Sarah Waters
Simone de Beauvoir
Salman Rushdie (some of it anyway)
Kafka
_The Unbearable Lightness of Being_ by Milan Kundera (I haven't read anything else by him)
Bret Easton Ellis 
William S. Burroughs 
Jack Kerouac 
James Baldwin
some of John Irving's stuff
Toni Morrison
Alice Walker
I have an incredibly beautifully twisted short story called _we so seldom look on love_ by Barbara Gowdy that I find absolutely delicious.
I've recently read _The Hours_ by Michael Cunningham, _Red Tent_ by Anita Diamante, _Wicked_ by Gregory Maguire and liked all of them, but haven't read anything else by those authors.
I like some of the stuff that's frequently studied in English classes (at least in America), _1984_, _Catcher in the Rye_, and _Brave New World_ come to mind.
I find Dickens and Dostoevsky to be tedious and boring.  I like the writing styles of Joyce and Hemingway but can't stand their content.

Anyway, those of you that read this, please recommend some books or authors to me if you can think of any that I like."

"event","Here is a warning that this post might upset or offend some people.  It's also pretty angry.
I don't know how to make a cut tag so I won't
I read somewhere that some concert with celebrities raised 18 million dollars for the Tsunami relief effort and I thought that's great, then I continued reading and saw that 130 million had been raised for a similar concert for 9/11.  That makes feel really ill.  4,000 people died in 9/11 more than 225,000 people have been killed by this Tsunami and the number will continue to rise.  I don't mean to minimize 9/11 but what is 4,000 compared to 225,000?  I feel very badly for the people who died and were injured in 9/11 and their friends and family, but I guess actually I do mean to minimize it because I don't see how you can possibly compare these things.  Are these people less important because they're brown or not american?  The amount of aid that the US government gave I also find to really pathetic.  Not as pathetic as the original amounts promised (15mil then 35mil), but compared to what a lot of countries are doing it's still pathetic. http://blogger.xs4all.nl/marcone/archive/2005/01/03/19687.aspx (I don't know how to make a nice link)compares the amounts given and breaks it down to how much it is per person.  Japan, Australia and Germany all gave quite a bit more in actual money and all have lower populations and GDPs.  Even Mali one of the poorest countries in the entire world donated money.  The US gave a couple billion dollars to florida and that death toll was maybe in the low 100s if that.  This whole thing just makes me really angry.
The response to genocides (or should I say the politically correct term ethnic cleansing, a term I loathe but that's for another time)I also find quite lacking.  Among other places there is currently a genocide going on in Sudan and no one seems to care.  I remember when there was ""ethnic cleansing"" going on in the former Yugoslavia people were really upset, but somehow when it happens in Africa or Asia or South America no one notices or cares...
I need to stop writing now."

"event","A year ago I was in India on the coast in an area possibly hit by the tsunami.  For 6 months I stayed mostly in areas hit by this tsunami.  I think entire areas that I visited have been destroyed, entire villages and coastlines.  People that I knew or met have been killed.  It's very, very sad.  I met some very beautiful people in places that were hit, and I wonder how many of them survived, or if they did survive did they lose everything?  I think of a sweet guy named Johnson that I used to rent surf boards from in Sri Lanka, his place was on the beach, I think of some nice waiters in India who gave me a free desert one day (something never done) and the restaurant where they worked (and probably lived) is on the beach.  I think of a beautiful old woman selling sarongs on a beach in thailand on the Andaman coast who loved that joked with her in Thai.  I think of Sapa, a wonderful woman (formerly middle caste) reduced by widowhood to selling fruit on the beach in India.  I wonder what has happened to these people and many more.  I will probably never know.  I want to goto Sri Lanka to help, but I am not sure what help I could really be with no training for this sort of thing.  I will give money, it is one thing I can do to help.  Most of the people affected by this were already incredibly poor, and many of them had everything taken away from them.  I don't think most westerners really understand the poverty that exists, and will perhaps become worse.  I shudder to think of that."

"event","After having so many amazing almost magical experiences traveling how am I to return to a ""normal life""?  I find this to be something extremely difficult, maybe even impossible.  After 14 months of travel ""normal life"" seems to be boring to the point of depressing.  I don't remember how I did it last time, I'm not sure I even did it successfully the last time anyway.  Now I am back in the west another disposable person, and it all seems so ridiculous.  I feel I want to go and live life and joy and freedom and here I cannot do that.  I don't think I'm cut out for this.
A lot of people are pushing me to do things that I don't know I want to do and be things I don't think I want to be.  I should finish my college education, I should settle down somewhere, I should think about the future, I should stop trying escape life through travel.  Perhaps that's not escape perhaps that's life.  Perhaps there is no future and by spending so much time thinking about it and planning for it I'm not living now.  Why should I settle?  Why should I return to that world?"

"event","Today I heard on CNN that the Senate and House just passed a bill that slashes the Pell grant.  Eligibility requirements will change (eliminating many who previously qualified) and the average amount awarded will go down by $1000.  The caps also haven't been raised for 3 years.  If I hadn't had the Pell (and FSEOG (a kind of supplement to the Pell)), even taking out the maximum amounts of loans I never would have been able to attend college.  I've been planning to move to New York and start attending Hunter in the fall.  After I got over a good degree of being upset (this actually made me cry) and anger about this, I started looking at costs and so on, and basically I found that it will not be possible to go unless I have residency (and I really don't want to not to goto college that much longer).  

Basically after adding up the max amount loans, the max pell minus 1k, a work study grant, and half the amount I received last time for the FSEOG and then subtracted tuition (for 12 credits a semester) and a really low estimate for books I found that I would have less than $750 a month to live on.  I really don't even see how that's possible.  I basically found no rooms in NY for less than $500 a month and very few that cheap.  Even if I got the extra thousand that would increase it less than $850 a month which still seems pretty impossible.  I just really can't see how this would possibly work.

I now have $18k in loans than I owe (minus whatever little bit I paid off and plus whatever interest has accumulated on them), for 2 1/2 years toward a degree in theatre.  I have really nothing to show for this it won't help in any aspect of my life I can think of.  I also really don't want to settle for a degree in something I'm not interested in that pays better.  I really have no idea what to do.  I've tried for scholarships before, but there's basically nothing out there for a 20something single female who isn't a mother.  Scholarships for non-traditional students basically suck or don't exist.

I thought about it and I decided that since uni seems impossible (given where I'm willing to go and so on) that I just won't go.  That instead I'll save money to travel around central and south america (plus the money for someone to make loan payments for me while I'm gone), if I'm really lucky maybe I'll find a boyfriend (that I  think I'd be compatible with for long term travel) or a gay man to travel around Africa overland with (like french west africa and places like that, not the more beaten path of SA and Kenya).

I have no idea how I'll ever pay those loans off without living with my mother til I'm 40 or live and not work in food service for the rest of my life or anything like that."

It seems from some things that I've heard dems say that the party might be moving even further to the right (and it's been moving rightwards as long as I can remember), so maybe instead of going along the more lefties should leave the party or drop support and get together various smaller groups groups (ie the greens (without Nader) and maybe if there are any socialist groups that aren't bickering trotskyites or stalinists or maoists) and dissatisfied left dems and form a new political party.  If the dems go too much more to the right the little bit that separates them will disappear and the lesser of two evils will just become the two evils.  The republicans are the younger political party here and they're 150 years old, so I think it's time to get in new parties.  I don't think the two party system works very well anyway...

About what the next four years will be like, I think a lot of other people have already said it.  It could be as bad as some of us imagine (more new wars, draft, further eroding of civil rights, complete dissolution of separation of church and state, big brother getting bigger etc etc) and I hope it won't be like that.

One more thing that I've been wondering.  I don't know much about this as a Jew.  Is it possible that in some kind of bizarre evangelist christian philosophy that Bush is trying to bring about armageddon or the end of days or whatever it's called?"

"event","Tomorrow is the US presidential election, the third I'll vote for president.  I feel that I have to do something that makes me uncomfortable.  The past two elections I was able to vote for third party candidates because in the state where I lived at the time the outcome was no question.  Hawai'i has now become a ""battleground"" state.  The polls actually show Bush slightly ahead here.  Hawai'i has for all of it's statehood until very recently been very democrat.  I don't like Kerry, and I don't really want him to be president, however the thought of 4 more years with Bush is much worse.  I really don't want to see another 4 years of Bush.  The 4 electoral votes of Hawai'i probably won't make much of a difference in the outcome of this election, but it's close enough that it's possible.  

My cynical self says that it probably doesn't make a difference who actually wins this election, I think Bush will probably still be president anyway.  If the Supreme Court needs to become involved again (which at this point likely, since several states appear to have voting and registration problems) I think that the outcome will likely be the same as '00.

This always brings me back to my feelings that I don't want to live in the US.  I haven't since as long as I can remember.  I don't really have a lot of options of where I can live (legally anyway).  Most countries (understandably, given our laws) don't like to give out work or residency visas for US citizens (especially ones with no occupation).  I know I could live legally in Israel (and having done that, albeit briefly, I don't really want to do it again anytime soon) or Cambodia (where you can buy a business visa for $25 and renew it indefinitely).  Right now I don't really know of other options (and I'd like to be somewhere that lets me to pursue theatre).  

Tomorrow, I'm going to go to the polls and reluctantly vote for Kerry.  This makes me quite uncomfortable, but I don't want in any way to contribute to four more years of Bush, and I can't imagine that Kerry would be any worse."

"event","The high holidays are almost here.  Last year I was in Israel during the high holidays.  It was absolutely amazing.  I'm not sure I can even describe what it felt like to be there for the high holidays.  It was very special.  Last year I spent Rosh Hashana in Tsfat, which is a beautiful town at the top of a hill in the north.  This was just an absolutely beautiful place to spend the new years, a good way to start the year.  I spent Yom Kippur in the jewish quarter of the old city of Jerusalem.  As I'm sure you can imagine that was also an amazing experience.  No cars, no people eating, no televisions, none of the distractions there are here.  This year I am at home in Hawaii.  It will a bit different this year.  This is one of the most beautiful places in the world, but how it will feel to be here for the holidays I'm not sure.

I spent last week on the big island.  I was staying in a beautiful place in Puna.  I would cross the street and sit and watch the waves break on the lava sea cliffs.  I thought if I dove off the cliff and swam straight out I would have to swim until I reached mexico.  It reminded me how small we are."

"event","Well I'm now back home.  I traveled for more than a year and it feels so incredibly strange to be back.  It's quite difficult actually.  It feels strange just to even be in a western country again.  It feels strange not to eat every meal in a restaurant.  It feels strange not to live out of a backpack and stay in guest houses.  It seems strange not to be in new places.  It seems strange not to meet new people all the time.  It seems strange not to just get up and go whenever I feel like it.  Actually just about everything feels strange.  

I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to be doing or anything like that.  Right now I'm trying not to make any plans.  It just seems way too soon to think about things like that.  I think after a trip this long it's difficult to adjust to the routines of something like daily life again.  I think it will take me a while.

I miss the constant stimulation of travel, life seems boring now.  

I miss the freedom of travel, life seems less free now.

In some ways I'm glad to be home.  I was feeling ready to stop traveling (at least for a while).  Now that I've stopped of course I want to be traveling again.  It's nice to see my mother and my cat.  It's nice to be able to listen to music I haven't heard in a long time.  It's nice to be able to eat mexican food.  

I think it's still too soon to know how this trip has changed me or changed my outlook on life.

However I am back in Bangkok and this is  the end of my trip.  I've been away more than a year now and the idea of going home is quite strange and frightening.  I do feel ready to stop traveling though.  I'm also completely broke now, so I also really don't have much of a choice.  I don't know exactly when I'll be home since I haven't bought a ticket yet (that's my task for the day), but it will be sometime soon.

Laos was nice.  I basically didn't do anything there or see anything there, but it was quite relaxing.  I just went to some travelers hangout and watched a lot of movies and stuff like that.

The trip to Laos was quite an experience, and a really nice way for Viet Nam to say goodbye to me.  My friend and I bought tickets from Hanoi to Vientiene, the journey is supposed to take about 25 hours.  We boarded a bus to a place called Hue (about 14 hours south of Hanoi, also the place with the boat robbing) and at about 2 am we were dropped off at a town about two hours from the border and told that a bus would come for us in half an hour.  There were also 4 others with the same ticket.  Then we were told the other bus had engine problems and would come at 4 or 5 in the morning, then it changed to 6 or 7 in the morning.  Should I mention also that the place where we waited made most restaurants in India look spotless.  At about 5 a local mini-bus came and took us to a place an hour from the border.  Also on it were two more guys who had been left to wait by their bus on the side of the road under an umbrella.  When we got to that town, they tried to get us to go on another mini-bus, but knew absolutely nothing about going to Vientiene.  We decided the best course of action (though most probably pointless as at least my friend and I knew by then that we had been ripped off) would be to call the travel agencies.  So we called and were told that the driver had run off with the money (although that later changed back to engine trouble and then back to driver running away and then back to engine trouble) and that they'd send another bus in about half an hour.  An hour passed and of course no bus came, so I called the actual bus company and was told that we should check into a hotel maybe a bus would come that night, maybe the next day.  So the 8 of us decided that no bus would come (and even if it did they might make us pay as they took all of our tickets from us on the first bus)so we shared a taxi to the border and then a song theow (a covered pickup with two rows of benches in the back) to a town after the border.  By then it was about 4 in the afternoon and no more buses were leaving for Vientiene that day so 6 of them decided to share a taxi and my friend and I stayed the night in the town.  We took a local bus the next day, which of course broke down about 1/3 of the way along so we waited 2 hours by the side of the road for another bus.  Finally we got to Vientiene, about 5 in the afternoon.  We checked into a hotel and left the next day for a place called Vang Vieng.

I stayed in Vang Vieng for the rest of my time in Laos (which was until I ran out of money).  Basically Vang Vieng is a travelers hang out, by a river and other tubing or visiting caves, there's really nothing to do but hangout or watch movies.  It was pretty relaxing, I watched a lot of bad movies.
The trip from Laos to Bangkok wasn't too bad considering, of course I picked a bad seat and the window leaked on me all the time it was raining, but there was only one unscheduled bus change and not too much delay.

Now I'm back in Bangkok and on my way home."

Viet Nam has been quite an interesting place.  It's a very beautiful country.  I find it odd that no one seems to speak of this when talking about Viet Nam.  Since I last wrote, I've gone up to the north of Viet Nam.  Along the way, I became a certified diver, got robbed (and got the money back) , learned I can still do a back dive and saw some very beautiful places.  Right now I'm Hanoi, tomorrow I'll be going to Lao.  In some ways I'll miss Viet Nam, in other ways I'm happy that I'll be leaving.  I've had some very good experiences with Vietnamese people, but I think I've also been ripped off more here than I have anywhere else on my trip.  

I'm going to be going back to Hawaii soon.  I don't know if I can call that home, because I'm not really sure where home is.  I don't feel like I can name a place that to me is home.  I really don't like to think about this.  Of course I'll be happy to see friends and my mother, but I don't know what I'll do there.  I find it stressful to even think about thinking about this.  I don't know how long I'll stay or where I'll go when I go.  I will be completely flat broke, so I'll have to work.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis early.  I've been travelling for more than a year now and I feel ready to stop for a while, but it's also still difficult to think about staying in one place.

Anyway, tomorrow I'm going to Laos, after than I'll go back to Thailand and arrange a flight to Hawaii.  I'm not sure yet when exactly that will be, but pretty soon.  I'll let you guys know.

"event","Well normally I don't write these so often, but Saigon has just been so interesting.  
Yesterday I went on a tour to the Cu Chi tunnels.  This is a tunnel system where Vietnamese opposition lived for twenty years during the war.  It was quite interesting.  On the way there our tour guide (who was on the American side during the war and had to spend 3 years in a re-education camp after) pointed out areas that had been blanketed in agent orange (regrowth has started, but it's definitely not the same as the areas that weren't) and for some odd reason a rubber plantation.  After that we went to the tunnels, we saw various parts of the tunnels (they've now been reinforced).  There was one spot where there was a tiny entrance that was a very small hole and it looked as if no one could get through it (it was smaller than lots of supposedly burglar proof windows), but all of us that tried had no problem. I also heard a half-serious half-joking conversation between two english boys about how cool it would have been to be in the Viet Nam war and kill people and have Vietnamese women and so on.  Rambo is really cool man.  We later went through a section of tunnel that was about 150m long and took about 15 minutes to get through squat-walking.  It was quite small and hot with little air.  I can't imagine how people lived here for so long.  The tunnels were ingenious.  Not a place for the claustrophobic however.
After the tunnels they said come look at Vietnamese monkeys and a big (it was huge, I've never even seen a photo of one this big) snake.  Then lets go off to the shooting range and throw grenades and shoot ak-57s and rocket launchers.  Needless to say it will probably surprise none of you that I didn't shoot a weapon.
After that we returned to Saigon and went to the war museum.  It was a really intense museum.  They had old american helicopters and tanks on display, tiger cages (where VC people were held in the South), a bloody guillotine and lots and lots of photographs.  There was a little section about how John Kerry had killed come innocent villagers when he was in Viet Nam.  Many of the photos were very, very disturbing.  Lots of photos of the war and war crimes committed.  There was a special section devoted to photographers killed during the war.  The most disturbing exhibit was of agent orange victims.  There were photos of babies and children deformed by the parents exposure to it.  It was quite disturbing.
Later that night (well I guess it was last night) I went out for a mad, mad night on the town.  First we went to bar/club and played pool for a night.  This wasn't so crazy yet.  Then we went to a club called ""Apocalypse Now"" filled with Vietnamese (including a lady-boy with a very funny perm)and dodgy looking expats.  They were playing really cheesy music (like take me home to west virginia) and showing football (soccer) on the telly.  We got bored of that pretty fast so we headed away from there and found a Vietnamese Saloon. It was great.  It had real saloon doors and the inside was very saloon like with loads of wood.  There was a band there playing pop covers (like Madonna and Santana), the bar was filled almost entirely with Vietnamese and it was hilarious and fun.  It closed so we headed to a club in the tourist area, which was insanely backed and from where we were sitting we could watch the fat old men find prossies and leave.  We headed to another club that played hip-hop and R&B, sometimes really cheesy stuff like MC Hammer and Busta Rhymes, though they really love the Fugees here.  There the night started to get funnier.  Sitting near me was a guy with a hooker and once when she left he decided he needed to speak to me, I didn't want to speak to him and told him that, he kept speaking to me so I old him I'd be rude and he kept on so I asked him if he ""came to Vietnam for the prostitutes or where they just a bonus of his visit?""  I then was kept amused by some scandinavian girls trying to entice men by dancing together but being very careful not to get too close.  We went back to the other bar which by then was also playing hip-hop and r&b.  There I met some hungarian guys from the countryside who wrote the first verse of hungarian national anthem for me and told me they imported ""THINGS"" to vietnam that were unavailable here.  Then we met some gay vietnamese guys who were really nice though one of them kept hitting on me and advised me not to go to gay bars to pick up men.  Finally we left, it was about 6am and the sun had already risen.  
The end."

I was a bit sad to leave Cambodia.  I really liked Cambodia.  The people were great, they were very nice and friendly and smiled a lot.  Angkor Wat was of course amazing.  It's just this huge amazing old city and temple complex in the middle of the jungle.  There's one temple that hadn't been cleaned up very much, with big jungle trees growing on the roofs and out of the walls of the temple.  It was like something out of a dream.  There was another temple with faces (intriguing smiling faces), big faces about 50 of them all of it.  Of course Angkor Wat itself was quite impressive, it was huge.  I don't think I really understood the layout until I saw a model of it.

I also went to Phnom Phen (Cambodia's biggest city) and that was fun and crazy.  I went out to club with about 10 people from my guest house on my birthday and had a blast.  I also went to one of the killing fields, this was very sad to see.  There were many children begging for money there.  I don't think some of them really understood what it was, I think they were too hungry to care.  I went to an absolutely amazing museum called Tuol Sleng or S-21.  It was a prison, where people were tortured before bing sent off to the killing fields to be murdered.  There were rooms there with the instruments of torture left in place, it was really disturbing and fascinating at the same time.  There were also photos of many of the victims, paintings by a survivor of the place (10,000 people went there during the Khmer Rouge and only 7 survived it), and biographies of some survivors and khmer rouge people.  I found that some Cambodians believe that Pol Pot is still alive.  I think this says a lot about the fear they lived in.

I think Viet Nam will also have interesting sites..."

So far the Cambodian people are just very truly nice, I've seen a lot of smiles.  It's much poorer than Thailand, but somehow the people seem happier.  A little girl gave me a bracelet she made, as a good luck present, knowing I wasn't going to pay for it.  She was very sweet and showed me her english school books.  I gave her a nice pen.

The last few days in Thailand I didn't do much.  I was accosted by a drunk mad australian, going on about the price of oil and bush and so on.  I also went back to the Mr. Friendly store, which is a great japanese kitch store selling ""mr. friendly"" products; pill boxes, tool boxes, notebooks etc.  The products say things like: ""He always stays near you and steels into your brain to lead you to good situations"".

Well after six months in India, I was never approached to be in a Bollywood movie.  Now I've been in Bangkok less than two weeks and I've been in a Bollywood film.  I was approached on the street and said sure why not.  So I was in club scenes for two days ""dancing vigorously"" and staring much, it was all very, very indian.  It was fun anyway.  The actors in it are quite famous in India, one of them I even recognised, and I haven't seen many Bollywood films.  They weren't very nice though, but that's basically to be expected.

Otherwise time seems to be going wuite quickly in Bangkok.  I've been here almost two weeks and seems like no time has passed, although I haven't really been doing anything so I can't really say why that is.  I've been eating loads of wonderful thai food like mango and sticky rice and green papaya salad with sticky rice.  I've been able to speak more thai.  It's much less rusty now than when I first arrived.  I find outside the really, really touristy places people are still pretty happy when I speak thai with them.

People have been telling me that the Thais in general (in tourist areas) are becoming less friendly and more resentful of tourists, and I think I can see this. I know that my Thai is rusty and my pronunciation has probably gone very much downhill since I haven't really been speaking Thai in about two years; but this time the Thais in this area (granted a tourist area) seem completely uninterested in the fact that I speak Thai and often answer me in English.  Before even in this area Thais would usually seem to like that I spoke Thai and ask me how I learned it etc.  This seems quite strange to me and quite unlike my previous experience.  The tourists here seem more immodestly dressed (by thai standards) than ever.  I think the Thais are probably just really tired of all the tourism and what it's doing to their culture and environment and probably also quite sick of all the tourists who have no interest in the local culture and just come for islands, prostitutes and cheap shopping.  That's the Lonely Planet for ya.  I'll write more later when I've been here longer and have a better idea of this.  There seems to be as many (or perhaps more) prostitutes than ever."

I stayed in a room with big windows out over mountains and a valley; when I woke up in the morning, I would open my curtains and look at the mountains and it was just so beautiful.  Two of the mountains have snow at the top.  I think this is the first time I've seen snow in at least 3 years.  

There are a lot of Tibetan refugees in Dharamsala (the Tibetan exile government and the Dalai Lama are here), on the streets you see monks and nuns everywhere.  Generally they're very friendly and like to speak to tourists to practice their english.  One day I went to see the Dalai Lama.  Everyone stood on two sides and watched him walk by.  It doesn't seem like much, but you could feel his presence.  He had a lot of energy and it was a special thing just to see him like that.

There are also some real crazies.  There was one tourist woman who walked around one day elbowing everyone she walked past (including the monks)very hard in the stomach.  There was a baba who painted himself whitish silvery (although in some places in India, this is a common sight).

I was here for pesach.  I went to seders at the local Bet Chabad 1st and 2nd night.  The first night was huge, the second nights seder was very small.  I think it's going to be very difficult to keep kosher for pesach in India.

I've just spent a week in Varanasi.  Varanasi is a crazy place.  It's probably the holiest place for Hindus, on the Ganga (ganges).  One of the first mornings there we woke up before dawn and watched the sunrise over the Ganga and then took a boat up and down.  Another evening we took a boat across and watched the sun set over Varanasi, it was incredibly romantic.  

Varanasi is an old city with tiny alley ways.  Wandering around it's easy to get lost (though for some reason I never did).  You walk by little chai shops and then you'll see a shrine and then a shop selling plastic junk then you'll see a sign saying baba blablabla touch him and he'll touch you.  

Walking along the Ganga you go from one ghat (steps to the river) to another.  You'll see dhobi wallahs washing clothes in the river.  Then you'll be in a market like place.  Then you'll walk past a wedding party making puja (ritual offering).  Then one guy will walk up to you and say ""Hash you  need hashish, very good price, very cheap, very high quality"".  Then in the next ghat you'll see men bathing in the river, in the middle of the river you'll see a dead cow floating along.  Then some guys will yell ""hello boat"", ""boat madam"".  Then some children wll walk up trying to sell you cheap postcards and if not ""one school pen"".  Now you'll look down at the river and see 10 feet of shit and rubbish and a dead body.  Then you'll hear someone yelling ""Baba baba"" and you'll see a guy with a long white beard and white hair and silver and gold clothes and makeup with an orange sarong.  Theen you'll smell then unmistakable smell of burning flsh.  You'v arrived at the burning ghats.  Here you watch with fascination as bodies are cleaned in the river and then burnt on piles of wood.  You'll hear the chanting ram manam sate as they carry the bodies.

I just arrived so I haven't done much yet, just hauled in a fishing net and tonight I'm going to buy a fish to be cooked.
Anyway, I'm happy to be out of Goa.  I spent too long there and it's nice to be in a city again as well.  
The train ride was interesting.  On the berth across from me was an extremely drunk middle-aged English man.  He had been drinking at a bar before going to the train and had a liter bottle of brandy with him (which over the course of the journey, including of course in the morning he consumed most of).  He was basically the stereotype of a drunk middle-aged English man.  He looked comically like a stereotypical English colonialist, tall, big-boned, red-faced (from the sun as well as drink), sandy-haored, safari style clothing.  He was loud and obnoxious and a bit belligerent.  He decided at one point that he needed to have a loud conversation with someone in the early hours of the morning when it was still dark and everyone was sleeping.  I asked him to keep it down and predictably he just got angry with me and later in the day was joking about pushing me off the platform (although I didn't find it very amusing).  Well, sometimes in India life is coming like this.
I've found while traveling (though especially in India) things just happen when you need them to (whether or not you know you need it to), for example every time I'm in an expensive area I always randomly meet someone to share a room with, even when I'm not looking.  On a long boring train usually someone interesting pops up to talk to.  When I don't know where I want to go, someone pops up to give me an idea or spur me on to leave a place I'm bored with.  It's really odd, but it always seems to happen.  Things also, when I needed a warm jacket, someone who was leaving gave me one.  It's quite odd, but things like this always seem to happen for me here.  
Well I think I've rambled enough for now."

Right now I don't have very much to write, I had an uneventful New Years and I don't really believe in resolutions.  
I must say though that if any of you ever go to India, try to visit Hampi in Karnataka.  It had these emazing, bizarre rock formations and ruins of the capitol of an old hindu empire.  It's like being on another planet."

"event","I'm still in India, still enjoying it.  I've been here about a month and a half now.  To give a brief update.  I flew into Delhi, went to a place called Jaipur, which has lots of Jewelry scams, fortunately I'm not so naive.  Then I went to a place called Pushkar.  I stayed in Pushkar for three weeks or so.  I basically did absolutely nothing there, but it's very difficult to find the motivation to leave Pushkar.

So after a long journey across half of India, including one night in Mumbai, I am now in a small city called Pune.  Pune (at least for foreigners) is most famous for the Osho Commune(www.osho.com).  Osho was a guru who attracted a lot of western followers, was kicked out of India, went to Oregon, was kicked out of the US, and returned to India, founding this commune.  He's been dead since the late 80s or early 90s.  The woman I'm traveling with (Katie) was interested in checking out the commune, so I tagged along.  This commune is considered by many a cult, and the followers: Sanyasas are also known as the orange people.

It's really a very amusing place.  It's very expensive by Indian standards (though cheap for the west), and it seems as if there's constantly something to shell out money for.  There's a strong undercurrent of sex and money.  Osho is known in the Indian press as the ""sex guru"".  You actually have to take an HIV test to join.  Also everyone wears maroon robes of varying styles (a lot of the girls wear sexy robes, which is offensive in India).  It's an ashram, there are many meditations everyday.  The mediations focus on dance, and while it's great that non dancers are enjoying dance so much, the trend seems to be dancing like a maniac with no rhythm.  There are other funny meditations as well (although I have to admit, a lot of it is fun, but I didn't feel any sense of meditation from them) like speaking gibberish and shaking.

Some of the people there literally walk around like Zombies, most seem ok though.  Also everyone constantly speaks of Osho and how great he was (I've read some of his stuff and he does have interesting ideas, and I think he made contributions), and chant his name, basically a lot of them worship this guy like a diety.  The most interesting and funniest thing though is the evening meditation. I had trouble preventing myself from laughing through a lot of this.

At the evening mediation everyone wears white robes, you'll get kicked out for not wearing white or coughing or sneezing.  It starts with everyone dancing maniacally and out of rhythm to Indian elevator trance.  Every once in a while some drum sounds and everyone chants ""Osho"".  Then they chant Osho again three times with their arms raised up (and they claim they don't worship him).  After this is silent meditation, followed by watching a video of Osho himself speaking for about an hour (called meditating to Osho's words, again he does say interesting things, but...), then gibberish for a few minutes, then everyone streams out.  This takes place in a big black pyramid.  The view of all the people in white walking down the stairs of the black pyramid is nice.  All the buildings in the commune are black, mostly very modern.  It's very nicely landscaped and there's a nice park as well.

Going to the commune was definitely an interesting and very amusing experience.

Tonight I am leaving for Goa, I'm taking a sleeper train, and tomorrow I should be relaxing on the beach."

"event","Ram Ram,
I am still in Pushkar.  I've been here about 3 weeks now.  I really don't anything here, but in a way it's very difficult to leave (even though I'm starting to get incredibly bored).  I don't do much here; I read, I talk to people, I play backgammon and cards, I wander around the market, I drink chai. 
I am starting to get very bored here, I'm even getting bored with the french boy.  
I have finally decided where to go next, and found out what times the trains leave (from a near by town) and how much it costs.  I'm going south, to better weather and beaches.  I'm going to one last place in Rajasthan, Udaipur, which is on the way south, after that it will just be more south and more south.  I want to go all the way to the southernmost states Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
Kerala, is less touristed than Goa (so far)and inside there is a town called Cochi, which was home to a small jewish community for a long time (maybe 2000 years), although now they've almost entirely made aliyah.
Sorry, no spellcheck possible, somehow the livejournal website is displaying everything in Hebrew, and I have no idea how to change it to english."

"event","Hello everyone,
It's been a while since I've written anything here.  I left Israel 2 weeks ago, and now I am in India.  Right now I am in a touristy little town in Rajasthan called Pushkar.  Pushkar is a cute little town, on a lake, and is an important pilgrimage site for Hindus.  I think there are more Israelis here than there are in Israel...well at least if you combined Pushkar and Goa...
I haven't seen much of India yet, actually just Pushkar, Delhi and Jaipur (which is also in Rajasthan).  It's not as crazy as everyone says it is.  It's very dirty, and very colourful, cows walk around on the streets in the cities and towns and everywhere they want really.  There are scams and so on, but most people are friendly.  There is though an incredible amount of poverty here.  It's quite depressing.  I don't know quite what I can do.  It is also an amazing place.
What no one ever told me though is that it gets cold at night here in November.  I wasn't really prepared for this, and I think I'm going to have to go south soon.

"event","Hello,
I realise I haven't written anything here in a while.
I spent about 2 1/2 months in Tel Aviv.  Last week I started travelling around Israel.  I spent Rosh Hashana in a place called Tsfat, which is a kind of mystical religious town in the North of Israel (and on the way out a religious person stole my sleeping bag!).  It was a nice experience I was going to a synagogue with a lot of singing.
Right now I am in Sinai.  I just got here today, but so far I like it, it's interesting and nicely different from Israel.  
I'm planning on spending Yom Kippur in Jerusalem, and then it will be back to Tel Aviv.  I'll probably leave for India in less than a month.
I'll try to write more soon.
Sorry, I've been so neglectful, internet access has been difficult.

"event","Hello everyone,

I hope you are all well.

I'm still in Tel Aviv.  I have a job in a pub now, so  I'll probably stay here a while, and then  it will be off to India or  Bangkok.

To say a bit more about what I've been doing since I've been in Israel, I was on that free tour for the first week and a half I was here.  We had Shabbat in Jerusalem.  We also had a really neat drama workshop.  Before we left Jerusalem we had a private concert by a well known Israeli musician.  We then went to the Dead Sea.  We hiked Massada at 4am and watched the sunrise from there over the Dead Sea.  We then went to the desert where we stayed in a Bedouin tent and had a workshop with an Israeli artist.  After than we went North to Zichron (between Tel Aviv and Haifa), by this time I was exhausted having had about 15 hours of sleep in 4 days, so that part is a bit fuzzy, but had lunch in a Druze village, and went to a blues bar.  After that we returned to Jerusalem for another Shabbat, this time we were at a kibbutz in southern Jerusalem.

Since the trip has been over I've been in Tel Aviv,  I haven't done much interested, gone to the beach a lot.  I've try to learn more Hebrew every day.  Jaffa is interesting.  It's quite old.

Please email me and let me know what's going on with you.

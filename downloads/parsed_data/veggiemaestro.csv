"event","Because it's been a year since my ""veggiemaestro"" pseudonym became out of date, and because I like a little bit of change for the new year, I will be changing my LJ username effective immediately.  My journal will still be friends-only, but if you are currently on the list, you have been added to my new username's friends list.  The journal is identical to this one, with just the new name, <lj user=boris_nyedlikev>.  Please update accordingly.

Also note that my AIM screen name has changed to: ishmaelofthewest"

A LOT has happened in the last two years, and not much of it has been good. But things are getting better...I make good money now, we're away from all the negative people who have been damaging our relationship, and we're closer than ever.

"event","being pregnant officially sucks. 

i find it extremely ironic that it's the people who have 10 kids between them who think that i am boring and drag down their good time because i am pregnant, as opposed to my single, childless friends. or rather, friend. 

personally, i think a certain someone has a crush on my boyfriend, and is looking for excuses to get him away from me so he will pay attention to her. 

most of the time, i want to be ghetto fabulous and punch her in her big teeth. but then i remember that i am trying to be high class, and classy people dont get into fist fights over their men when they are pregnant.

besides, when alfie was filling out a job application yesterday, he put down that i am his fiancee. now if only he would formally ask me...."

"event","so. it would appear that over the course of the last two or three months, i have gained almost 25 pounds. now, while some people carry extra weight well, i do not. i no longer fit into the majority of my clothes, and those that still button/zip/cover my lovehandles are so tight that i am ashamed to go out in public. 

as a result, i have decided that i am going to lose not only those 25 pounds that have mysteriously found their way to my midsection, but i am also going to lose another 20 pounds on top of that, making my goal weight 120 pounds. i understand that this is mildly unrealistic, but im gonna give it a shot. there are alot of really great numbers between 120 and 165. 

i have a distinct feeling that my weight loss success is going to rest solely on the shoulders of exercise, because i am poor. and it is a proven fact that the poor cannot afford healthy food, which is why they are among the least healthy in this country. so my goal is to spend at least an hour a day doing some sort of cardiovascular activity, and a half an hour of weight training every other day. 

i need to call the Y and find out if i qualify to get a free membership becuase i am so poor. maybe ill give them a sob story about how ive gained so much weight, and i cant climb a flight of stairs without wheezing anymore, and yeah. the Y is way better than the gym at the college. mostly becuase i hate working out in front of all the little sorority girls and their size 0 spandex. 



watch me turn out to be pregnant.

"event","i havent been able to sleep the last few nights, and its really starting to get to me. all i seem to be able to do is lay in bed and think about all the ways the creepy old guys at work harass me. so now its three am the night before my industrial safety final, and i am updating my livejournal and eating a chocolate chip cookie. this sucks.

so yeah, im poor, and yet i insist on having a decent christmas. therefore, i am launching myself even further into credit card debt in order to buy al good presents. 

i have quite decided i need to make more girlfriends. i have none. at least, none that still live in keene. and certainly none that plan on coming back to keene after graduation. 

its weird how i can be so happy, and yet so miserable at the same time. it just baffles me. i have an amazing boyfriend who is crazy about me, but i live in a shithole apartment that im pretty sure is rotting from the inside out, thereby giving me allergies and causing me to perpetually be sick. i have a shitty job that pays me worse money, where i get sexually harassed and treated like im stupid because i dont have a college degree yet. too bad im probably smarter than just about everybody in management. i drive a shitty car that breaks down every other day, and if it werent for jeremy (who is a fucking saint for putting up with me), it would probably be a gutted carcass at nick's used cars and parts by now. and the fact that all of our money goes directly to paying bills, so that we have no opportunity to save anything, only makes things worse. we talk about moving to a new apartment. we talk about buying a house. we talk about getting married. but at the rate we're going, we're going to be 50 years old, still unmarried, still living in the same shitbox becuase we cant afford anything else. i keep telling myself that once i graduate things will be better, but its going to take me at least another two years to finish. probably more. all because we cant afford for me to go to school full time. other people make the real world seem so easy - its not. and it sucks. but at least i have al. being with him makes it all worth it, really. and i know that if we can make it through this, what with my constant tantrums and lashing out for no reason because i dont know what else to do, then i know we can make it through anything. 

i just reread that, and i gagged. thats my cue to go and pimp myspace until the alarm goes off at five."

im also having a hard time with al's trip to concord. like, im glad he wants to go see his friends, but does he really need to be there for a week? and i love how the plan just randomly went from me driving him up later in the week to him leaving tuesday afternoon with no warning. especially since i asked him last week to help me figure out this whole insurance thing so i could get my car registered and give my dad's back, and he didnt do anything. im starting to feel like the only time anything gets done is when i do it, and i dont have time to do most of the stuff i need to. and it really hurt when he didnt even call to say goodnight last night...it really made me feel unimportant and like he doesnt miss me at all. i dont know.

last night we were getting some stuff unpacked when he came across some old letters from this girl melissa he used to live with. she wrote him these letters after they had broken up, and apparently he never read them because i started reading them out loud and they were HILARIOUS. they were all like, you're my soulmate, i love you so much, i'll love you till the day i die even if you marry someone else, blah blah blah. keep in mind, this is a girl who had a 5 year old kid when then started dating, at age 19, and after a year and a half goes to al, ""i like my boss and i want to go out with him instead."" and when that didnt work out, she wanted al back. so the letters go on to say how when he's ready to have kids, he ""can have one"", and that if he would like her demon child will call him daddy. so then, and this is the best one, she starts talking about how he is the stars and she's the moon and you cant have the moon without the stars, and i quote, ""What i'm trying to say is WILL YOU MARRY ME HONEY???"" underlined. just like that. with three question marks. in a letter. after they have broken up. i thought i was going to die laughing. partially because the majority of these letters were incoherent due to poor spelling, grammar, and made up words, and partially because while most people write letters like that to their ex, few actually send them. 

i got to see al all dressed up in his spiked collar and bracelets. that made me laugh.

he also found some pictures of his ex kate, and i was looking through them, and they made me a little sad because you could tell how much he loved her by the way they were taken...obviously she was a pretty girl, prettier than me, but the way these pictures were taken you could really see her the way he saw her, and she looked so beautiful. i worry sometimes that he doesnt see me that way, that in spite of what he says there's a little part of him that wishes he was still with her..."

at 2, i called the house to see what the plan was, because i was supposed to go to brattleboro when i got out of work and i wanted to know if that was still happening. but no one answered, so i figured they had gone to lunch or something and would be in later. at like, 315, they show up. so im talking to him, and he starts talking about how they didnt leave for like, three hours after he called. im like, but i called at 2 and no one answered. hes like, well, we were at the house....so that bugged me a little bit that he didnt answer the phone, but whatever. 

no big deal. 

so then he said that he would meet me at the track at four thirty the next day, and we would hang out. at five thirty, i call to see where he is. he answers the phone (still in brattleboro)and tells me that he forgot what time we were supposed to meet, and he was waiting for me to call him becuase he cant call long distance on cindy's house phone. mind you, i can hear chelsea in the background, who has a cell phone. and while hes talking, he starts coughing because he's smoking a bowl. so im like, 

cool. you would rather smoke pot than see me. 

so he came over, and we talked it out, and everything was fine. 

until tuesday. 

when he was hanging out with karl, and i was at the track meet. so its getting done, and i called to see where he was, and if he wanted to hang out. hes like, we're at seth's house, but do you want to go to applebees at 8? so im like, well this might get over at 730, can i just meet you at seths? and he goes, you dont know where here is. so i ask him to tell me, and hes like, well, i cant really invite you here becuase seth is karls friend. and im thinking to myself, 

uh huh. like youve never invited me to a friend of a friends house before. 

but again, i tried not to get upset, because it would be stupid. i was going up to burlington to see kristen friday night, and he was thinking about going to concord to see some friends. originally, he had planned to go up thursday night, and come home saturday. but his car had to get worked on first, so he was gonna go friday night. since i had to work today anyway, i was like, just stay till sunday. he was like, that sounds good, ill come over at five when you get out of work. so five oclock rolls around, and hes not here. i take a shower, and at 6, i im his friend will to find out when he left concord. will tells me hes still there. 

shock. 

when i ask what time hes coming home, he calls to explain that his battery died, and he had to get it recharged today, and now hes tired, and hes going to stay till tomorrow. 

even though he has a car appointment in keene at 8am. 

so i dont really know what to think. i know that im being needy and clingy and all those things that guys hate, but i cant help it. i dont know what my problem is. i just miss him so much. i dont know. im stressing out about school, and that always makes me freak out about lame other stuff. i just need to relax, and we all know that will happen...never. fuckin a.

i miss him."

your mother said you went away
She said there was nothing that I could have done
There was nothing nobody could say
Me and you we've known each other 
ever since we were sixteen
I wished I would have known 
I wished I could have called you
Just to say goodbye...

when all the others turned away 
turned up their nose
We liked the same music 
we liked the same bands

the wildest things we'd ever seen
Now I wished you would have told me 
I wished I could have talked to you

gonna ever understand me
the way you did
Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere
In some bus or train traveling along
In some motel room 
there'll be a radio playing
And you'll hear me sing this song
Well if you do you'll know 
I'm thinking of you and all the miles

And I'm just calling 
one last time 
not to change your mind
But just to say I miss you baby

"event","so. christmas was really good this year. minus the part about finding out that my boyfriend is moving to florida. but even that i can look on the bright side: i have somewhere to go for spring break. 

i need to try and get this whole jealous and insecure thing under control, because no one wants to put up with that. especially not my boyfriend. i think i realized just how stupid it is to get so worked up about things when i found myself getting insanely jealous of his ex girlfriend. like really? what the point of that? shes an ex for a reason. and if im not careful, i will be too. because i whine too much. and i freak out about the dumbest stuff. and thats just not cool. the last year or so has been really rough on me, and its kinda freaking me out that things are going so well lately. i think thats part of my problem. i keep waiting for him to drop the bomb. i keep waiting for things to go to shit. almost to the point of not enjoying the relationship i have. this is the first one since josh thats made it past the one month mark, and its kinda freakin me out. 

hes so amazing. ive never had a guy treat me as well as he does. and im a little worried about him going to florida. like, i know that on my end nothing will change. thats just how i am. but i dont know if he feels the same way about me as i do about him. but i need to put these ridiculous thoughts out of my head. everything will be fine. im just going to miss him like whoa. 

i wish i had a better attention span. none of those paragraphs are complete thoughts. oh well. i know what i was trying to say. 


what are people doing for new years? i need a plan, and so far i have my parents party, and toms. neither of which are particularly stellar options. oh well. i'll come up with something really creative. and it will be superfun. but right now i am going to go look up lodging options at okemo."

"event","nicky taught me to drive stick last night. apparently im pretty good at it. he also got drunk and told me that he didnt just randomly buy me slim jims for my birthday like he originally said, but that he remembered one time just after we met that i called him from 7-11 and was buying slim jims and had mentioned that i really liked them. meaning he actually remembers shit like that. which makes me wonder if he's going to remember how i was telling him about the cinderella snowglobe at the disney store that i wanted and my mom wouldnt get me for christmas...why is it that i break a guys heart and he still treats me eighteen kajillion times better than my boyfriend? 


i told the guys that i would be sober sister on the trip to st. johnsbury saturday, before i realized what i was agreeing to. i have to get up at the ass crack of dawn (like, 5) to ride to st j with nick and a bunch of middle-aged men, where i get to watch them bowl for six hours. then we will go to dinner where they will buy me steak, i get to watch them get wasted, and then they will sexually harass me. and then i get to drive home. in jeffs expedition. which is huge. and not cheap. and in all honesty, the only reason i did was becuase i was feeling neglected by my darling boyfriend, and part of me is hoping that when i tell him, he will get jealous. which he wont. but part of me is still hoping. 


i think the hardest thing for me right now is the fact that im a hypochondriac, but i have no one to hypochondriac to. kristen comes home in 11 days."

"event","so last night i went out with al, and the party was lame. so we stopped by yankee lanes (shock) to have a drink with doug. afterward we went back to carls house and watched eurotrip till carl and jimmy got home. jimmy was headed out again, and carl passed out, so al and i ended up in jimmys room making out. things were getting pretty intense, when he suddenly sat up and was like, we need to stop cause i dont want to do anything you dont. but its been like, a year, so i was like, no, i think i want to. but before anything happened, jimmy came home. so that was the end of that. as i was getting ready to leave, i realized that we had been about to make a huge mistake because im just not ready yet. of course, i figured he'd be like, right....when i told him that. but he was just like, thats fine. whenever youre ready. in all honesty, im having a hard time believing hes for real. i keep waiting for him to turn into an asshole like every other guy i know. i might as well enjoy it while it lasts, right?"

"event","so. yesterday was thanksgiving. i got wasted. shock.

lindsay smoked a cigar with my uncle. if i hadnt been so drunk, i would have taken a picture.

todds friend pat stopped by. it made it feel more like thanksgiving. i talked to him for a while. it turns out chris has been really weird lately and they dont talk much. but pat looked good, and thats good. i just felt bad that i was so drunk. cause i really didnt expect him to show up, and i got wasted cause i was bored. oh well. its not like hes never seen me drunk before.

i really need to see al, because ive been thinking about alot of things, and i think seeing him would lay alot of my fears to rest. 

i have a wine headache. and im tired. im frustrated and i dont really know why. i guess i'll go clean my room so i can watch a movie later."

"event","nothing amuses me more than people who call me at 2 am to try and make fun of some lame thing i posted in my journal months ago, like im not going to know who it is. honestly. i couldnt care less. i was, however, going to apologize for certain unkind things i said about this person (also months ago, before i ever actually met her), because it was not Christian of me to say them. oh well. at least i have better things to do with my time than make lame prank phone calls at 2 oclock in the morning because i think im funny. 


for the record kristie, i really was sorry about what i said. i had completely forgotten about it, and when i found out that you had read that, i felt awful. but getting a phone call at 2 am that i would assume was meant to be offensive (it wasnt, because frankly, i couldnt care less what you or anyone else thinks about me) kinda made me think i didnt need to. especially because you blocked the number. if youre going to do something like that, have the balls to own up to it. since chelsea has gotten to know you, and has told me that youre pretty cool, i have no problem with you. if you want to be an adult and talk about it, that would be great. however, if you decide that you dont want to try and work things out, please just let it go. calling my phone, whether you block the number or not, is a waste of your time and mine. i dont care if you dont like me, thats your right. but im not a fan of being harrassed, and i wont put up with it. its your call."

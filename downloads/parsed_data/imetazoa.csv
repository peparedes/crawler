"event","""If Behe wishes to suggest that the intricacies of nature, life, and the universe reveal a world of meaning and purpose consistent with a divine intelligence, his point is philosophical, not scientific. It is a philosophical point of view, incidentally, that I share. However, to support that view, one should not find it necessary to pretend that we know less than we really do about the evolution of living systems. In the final analysis, the biochemical hypothesis of intelligent design fails not because the scientific community is closed to it but rather for the most basic of reasons -- because it is overwhelmingly contradicted by the scientific evidence.""

""Dembski's argument boils down to a recasting of an old creationist claim that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. Put simply, this law states that in the universe, there is a tendency for complexity to decrease. How then, ask the creationists, can evolutionary processes produce more complex life-forms from more primitive ones? But we have long known why this type of argument fails: the second law applies only to closed systems, and biological systems are not closed.""

""What exactly did the designer do, and when did he do it?""

""Newton found himself stymied by the complex orbits of the planets. He could not think of a natural way to fully account for their order and concluded that God must nudge the planets into place to make the system work. (So perhaps in this one sense, Dembski  is the Newton of information theory.) The origin of species once seemed equally mysterious, but Darwin followed the clues given in nature to solve that mystery. One may, of course, retain religious faith in a designer who transcends natural processes, but there is no way to dust for his fingerprints.""

""In the absence of evidence that natural selection and random variations can account for the apparently designed features of living things, the entire question of design must be reopened. Alongside Darwin's argument against design, students should also be taught that design remains a possibility.""

""Evolutionary theory is not inadequate. It fits the evidence just fine.""

""Although William A. Dembski, one of the movement's leading figures, asserts that ""the empirical detectability of intelligent causes renders intelligent design a fully scientific theory,"" its proponents invest most of their efforts in swaying politicians and the public, not the scientific community.""

""Jonathan Wells, a biologist, and Michael J. Behe, a biochemist, seem just the CRSC fellows to give intelligent design the ticket to credibility. Yet neither has actually done research to test the theory, much less produced data that challenges the massive evidence accumulated by biologists, geologists, and other evolutionary scientists... At heart, proponents of intelligent design are not motivated to improve science but to transform it into a theistic enterprise that supports religious faith.

So the movement is advancing, but its tactics are no substitute for real science.""

""Evolution, in his(Dembski) view, ""is the ultimate status quo"" and ""squelches dissent"". Young people, who ""love rebellion"". see that and are attracted to ID as a result. ""The public supports intelligent design. The public is tired of being bullied by an intellectual elite"". He contends that skeptics resort to rhetoric and ""artificially define ID out of science,"" allowing in only material matters.






hey dembski,
publish some papers and then maybe ID wouldn't be defined out of science."

"event","intelligent design is a valid theory that opposes evolution. that is not the issue which raises the problem. the issue that raises the problem, is that this valid theory, is not a scientific theory. science is defined as knowledge that is acquired from the scientific method. the scientific method involves formulating a theory, testing the theory, and coming to conclusions based on your results and observations. 

if you argue that intelligent design needs to be introduced into science classes, based on the fact that it is the contrary alternative to evolution, other alternatives must be introduced that are contrary to evolutionary theory... such as aliens. aliens do not fall into the category of ""higher being."" Higher being infers divine power. Divine power refers to abilities organisms in this universe are not capable of. Therefore aliens, which are thought to exist in the universe, would need to be introduce as a further alternative to ""higher beings"" and evolution (the flying spaghetti monster does unfortunately is not included in my argument cause he is viewed as a religious figure and infers ""divinity,"" where as i am suggesting that aliens have no religious affiliation, and no divine powers, but they just exist)."

"event","today sucked hardcore... well it would have sucked hardcore had it not been enlightened by a certain beautiful person (that gave birth to an even more beautiful person aka: amanda). mrs. johns came to boston and we had a wonderful lunch/dinner/does it really matter? it was good food in my tummy. and i learned all about what my beautiful amanda has been up to. and i got to talk about my buttface. and it was just really nice to see a familiar face from back home and from times that i miss so dearly.

on another not so happy note, i am still doing lab work for biochem that is due at 10am. i have class from 9am-3pm straight then i go directly to my research lab and run some experiments. i'll probably get out at 5, have dinner w/ matthew (hopefully), go home, go to sleep, and then go watch... a famous/older movie that was on my list of movies to see which is now drawing a blank in my mind.

i need some amp. RAPIDAMENTE!"

Hello everybody...Due to some rookie douchebag idiot spreading rumors and posting them on Absolutepunk.net without our consent, our New Found Glory UK tour, Drive Thru UK/Europe Invasion Tour, and Drive Thru Australia Tour has been cancelled. We tried in every way to make the tour happen but because of all the confusion, our funding for the tours was cut and we were dropped off the bill. To clear the air and set everyone straight...HOME GROWN HAS NOT BROKEN UP. We continued on and played our two shows at Thousand Oaks and Lancaster which were fun as hell and we'd like to thank all the kids for coming out. The new demos will be posted up soon and make sure to come see us at the San Diego Ground Zero show and the Anaheim House of Blues show featuring our favorite local band, Power Serge. More shows will be posted up soon. El Modena Class of 1993.""

also, i officially have a nice small studio this summer in west campus.
i have a good chance at UROP funding.
i am now the vice president of the bioethics society (everyone join!) along w/ emily who is the secretary and who is wonderful and is going to be an awesome roommate next year.
and i'm going to get straight A's because i'm dropping physics.
and i have recieved another free item... a ps2 thin for my buttface.
and because i freaked out when i heard home grown was breaking up, i went and bought a shirt... which i just recieved in the mail today. which is awesome.

"event","It's so strange to be called to do something, to know in your heart what you were meant for. My whole life I've always felt like there was something waiting for me, something amazing God created me to do. But I've never known, never cared enough to actually pray about it. And now He has spoken to me, as clearly as He ever could. He has given me a heart for the nations, for the starving children in this world. Here I am in my comfortable house in my comfortable life in America, never actually letting it sink it that there are others so much more unfortunate. Of course I've always known there was poverty, and I've always felt horrible about it. But not until now did I realise I have to do something. That one day I will stand before God and be held accountable for everything I've done and haven't done. My life shouldn't be wasted in America, never reaching out to the needy, never going beyond my own safe little box, because I'm scared. But its more than just being scared, also. We're too ignorant here, we don't know what its like to be starving, what its like to not know where our next meal is coming from. There's a whole area of our minds we've never reached. The part that understands suffering. None of us here in America other than the absolute poorest of us know what its like to suffer. Searching through a dump each day to just find food and clothing is an incomprehensible concept to us. We can't wrap our minds around it. But others go through it everyday. Their whole lives is suffering. It makes me sick to think of the celebrities with their millions of dollars, living in huge luxurious mansions, throwing huge lavish parties, while millions are dying from hunger and diseases soley because they weren't born into the priviledge which we were. We have the most responsibility for those suffering, because we are born with the most priviledge. Completely unneeded things fill up our whole lives. Cell phones, ipods, things such as that which we feel are necassary when they are 100% NOT. Not even running water or electricity is necassary, and we feel we would all die without those things. Do you see how sad our existances are? How ignorant we are to reality? And its hard to come by a teenager in this generation who actually gives a crap about those less fortunate than themselves. We would rather keep on living our comfortable lives than be bogged down by the thoughts of those suffering in other parts of the world, just because they seem so far away and we can't even grasp what they're going through. 
I choose to be different. I choose to give my heart to those in need, because it is the only thing other than loving Jesus Christ that matters in this world. I refuse to live my comfortable life here in America, never giving a second thought to the needy. I refuse to even only donate and never actually go and be the light in a child's life. I will travel the seas to reach out to those who know nothing of education or of Jesus, who's lives seem completely hopeless. It starts with the children, because they are our futures. Its not their fault that they were born into the mess they live in. I could just as easily be one of those children living in a shack, digging through dumps. But I'm not, and therefore I'm responsible to help them in any way I can. I will not push them out of my mind, just because its unpleasant to think about. These are lives which deserve every chance anyone else is given. How many genius minds are wasted because they were never given the chance to be educated? I choose to change lives."

"event","So it is August...that means school is almost here. I can't explain to you the dread that filled me even as I wrote that sentence. Summer is almost cruel in a way. It just gives you time off, which of course, is nice, but it also ends. When it ends, you can't imagine actually having to work again. Getting up at 5:30 seems inhuman, and coming home with even more work, math for that matter, doesn't seem like it will happen. But of course, it does, just like it does every other year. For some reason, each summer we get so used to just relaxing and it seems limitless amount of time stretches before. Then August hits us unexpectedly, and we remember September is when our worlds end. I've always found the kids who actually enjoy going back to school the strangest creatures. How could you possibly prefer work to leisure? Maybe I'm just lazy, but it can't be normal. Holding on and treasuring the last few weeks before school seems a chore in itself, because times keeps going and we're powerless to stop it. It's the 9th today, and soon, before I know it, it will be September 4th, the night before the first day of school, and it won't seem like a second went by from this moment to that one. Quite a depressing thought, but its true. I hate not ever getting enough sleep, no matter how early you get to bed or however many naps you take. I hate teachers and homework, and not feeling good about yourself in front of others numerous times throughout the day. How much easier is it to just not worry about those things? Sleep in til noon, and do whatever you want with your day? Obviously its better, but work is necessary for survival, and not a one of us is going to escape that fact. I swear I'm enough educated just the way I am right now. Most people 100 years ago never even made it to grade 10. Did it even exist? I don't know, so why must I? The only thing I can imagine myself getting smarter at is math, which I heartily dislike and do not care to know more about. Whatever I do in my life, I will not have to know the math I will learn from here-on-out. I am perfectly knowledgable in anything I will actually use in my life. So why this unecessary educating? I'm all for education, but what really am I going to get out of this? Three more years I have at that place, and I have a feeling they're not going to be short."

"event","I feel like at least ten pounds has been lifted from my chest. I went to my former best friends house today, because we both felt how much we missed each other. Just talking to her was something I can't even explain how much I missed having. It was such a relief when she messaged me on myspace saying she felt the same way I did, so I no longer felt stupid for feeling that way. So I went to her house, and of course things were kind of awkward at first because we haven't talked in months, and things got pretty mean during that time between us. But we both felt the void in our lives where the other had been, and just being able to talk to each other felt so comforting and nice. I've known this whole while she truly was my best friend, but it was hard to admit that to myself while all of this was going on. She went out and got new friends and started doing all this crazy new stuff without me, so I guess I just felt really pathetic for wanting to be best friends again, especially when she was turning into someone I strongly disliked. But she's still the same person, just experienced more. We still have tons to talk about, and stuff stopped being awkward because we just know each other and like talking. It was so good, and I thank the Lord that this happened. From now on our friendship will be more complicated due to the fact that we share no mutual friends, but I think we will appreciate it more, because we know now what its like to not be friends, and neither of us liked that much. This is just an example of how things really do work out in the end, and I'm not just being naive. I know there's a lot more to come, and its probably not all positive, but God has a plan, and I want to make sure it is always fulfilled throughout my life."

"event","It's amazing that I actually survived freshman year, because I didn't believe I was going to at many points along the way. My only hope can be that each year will pass as quickly. But time is a strange thing, mostly because it never stops. Yet while we go through each trial, it seems as if those torturous moments will never end. Looking back, though, obviously it did, and there you are. I can hope to God that September will never come, that sophomore year will never start, but of course it will, without fail. Or I could pray that it would all just be over with, that I could just skip the whole monstrous affair of high school. But this could never happen either, because time does not leave out anything. To get to where you are wanting to be, you must go through every moment until then. However unkind those moments may be. There's no way out of this, no matter how hard we could hope or pray. What I do pray is that it can go over smoothly, without leaving me with whatever unpleasant memories I fear I will possess one day. I know the Lord will do His will, but praying that His will is in favor of me is not so wrong, is it? Perhaps it is in some way. I just don't want to go through hell. I want friends and fun. Not friends who pressure me, or nonexistant friends. I'm scared there are no people at my school who would understand me. Even the friends I do have do not understand me. I love them, but I feel as if there has got to be someone with a more kindred heart to mine. Possibly in the form of a good-looking boy? Or is that too much to ask for?"

"event","So, as this school year comes to a close, I'm trying to figure out what I have learned.
That people who you believe to be your best friends have the ability to drop you faster than a hot pop tart on a cold kitchen floor? 
That if you feel something is wrong with a relationship, there is? 
To not ignore the things your heart screams at you, just because you don't want to address the issue?
That to become something else for other people just because you feel what you truly have to offer is not enough is a certain way to become completely and utterly unhappy with yourself?
Not to sacrifice parts of who are just because they're considered ""uncool""?
Yes, I have certainly learned all of these things, and I can feel how much progress I've made with myself as a human being, and I'm much happier with where I am. Parts of that may be because I went to one of my first parties and realised that's not who I was or would ever become. I recieved my purity ring from my mother and of course people make fun of me for it, but the most beautiful thing I've found is that I honestly don't care. At all. I know who I am and what I stand for, and thats something i didn't know before the experiences I've had this year. That doesn't mean I am completely satisfied with myself. There are definitely places in my life where I'm lacking. I would like to become much more outgoing and not so introverted, wanting to just stay in my safe little box all the time. I feel like its almost impossible for me to make friends. And its not 'cause I'm mean or unfriendly to those I don't know, it's just that I don't want to reach outside of myself to others, because overall it makes me pretty uncomfortable. I'm scared they won't like me, or I won't like them. I feel as if I am a very different sort of person and there's not a whole lot of people who would understand me. Maybe everyone feels that way to some extent, but I truly think that sometimes I can make people feel weird when I speak my opinions on subjects (which usually tend to be pretty strong) or display my sense of humour, because maybe they are just a different type of person. I just want to extend my comfort zone, so that new people don't make me feel uneasy plainly because I don't know how they'll feel about who I am. That is one of my major goals this summer, along with trying to lose a few pounds, like 5 or 10, maybe get down to 115, 'cause I think I may look scary if I got lower. I just pray that I won't lose myself and all the soul-searching I've had to do this last school year, because more than anything I just want to stay strong in my beliefs and what I stand for. I'm scared some hot guy will come along and everything I've learned about unhealthy feelings and relationships will go out the window. Seeing one of my best friends disrespect herself by only wanting to have ""fun"" and therefore failing all her classes, getting drunk, high, and giving herself away to guys has really made me realise how utterly insane and stupid the saying ""I do whatever I want!"" is. To do whatever you want could be the worst possible thing for you. You stretch and grow through discipline. You'll never be happy with who you are if you expect nothing from yourself. Just having ""fun"" will not pay off in the end, and you'll wish you would have seen that while you were having all that ""fun"". I just pray to the Lord that I have the strength to stand firm in Him and myself. Or my words and actions (my entire life) will be completely worthless."

"event","I've definintly learned a lot about myself these past couple of days. One is that I can't stand people thinking they know who I am and what I'm about. Especially when the only things they hear about me are from someone who is severely at odds with me right now. If you only knew the negative things about someone, you probably wouldn't think you like them much either. And no one would like you if thats all they knew. Thats our exact situation here. And, no, I don't care about them liking me or not, but I just don't want them commenting me and saying stuff behind my back when they know <strong>nothing.</strong> Some of the stuff they're saying almost makes me laugh, 'cause its just so off. But this whole thing is definintly not making me laugh most of the time. I think most people I talk to this about think its just some teenage drama thing. And it is in multiple ways, but it has exceeded the level of just being ""drama"". Its officially a life-changing thing. Best friends not being friends at all anymore after seven years is pretty serious if you ask me. And it feels more real than anything in my life has felt in a long time. But something underlying thing beneath the surface is telling me this is for good in the long run. I'm sure God has completely different plans for our lives. Or maybe just mine at the moment, because I'm pretty sure she isn't wanting to be anywhere near God's plan for her right now. I'll just pray, because no human strength is going to resolve this thing. If its even meant to be resolved. I'm sure we'll talk someday and come to some sort of resolution, and then we'll be over, 'cause I don't think we're done just yet. There's more for sure. But no more friendship. I've seen a girl inside of her through this whole thing that I would never want to become friends with."

"event","So now my former best friend is telling all her new ""friends"" bad stuff about me, so they're leaving me comments on myspace saying they hate me and I'm a bitch. I've never done anything to them, or to her for that matter. She's just so insecure about who she is, she has to feel better than someone else. I'm just at such a loss for what to do right now. I know the mature thing would be to not even acknowledge the mean and untrue things they're saying about me. But its so hard, because its human nature to just want to fight back. I really don't feel like fighting, but I definintly feel like defending myself. One doesn't come without the other most of the time. All I have to do is pray and hope they just get over it. I'm just so sick of feeling treaded on."

"event","Well this is my first time ever journaling online so its a little new to me, but I'm just gonna write and see where it takes me. 

Right now I guess you could say I am unhappy. &nbsp;I'm not just gonna sit here and complain because thats not going to get me anywhere. But you know when you start to get that gnawing feeling inside your stomache telling you that your life is so much smaller than it should be? The people you know, the places you've been. It could be so much more. And yet you just sit there at home, doing nothing with your life, waiting for something to happen to you, but never taking the initiative in having that something happen. I get up in the morning, go to school, come home, do homework, maybe watch some tv, go to bed. Is that all life is about? I know its not, but thats what my life has become about. I guess I'm lacking drive right now because I'm lacking a purpose. A destination I'm working towards. I just work and work and get nowhere with it. And all in all that leaves you feeling pretty depressed.&nbsp; 

Don't even get me started on my social life, though. I've had a best friend for seven years of my life (since i was eight years old) and now we're just starting to go our own ways. We're different people with different ideas about who we want to be. And those people clash in a significant way. She wants to be a ""rebel"" (although she'd deny it) and I'm wanting to be a better and better person everyday. I've done a lot of stuff I regret and most of them have been with her. The major problem here, though, is that we have two classes together and ride the bus home with each other and live about a block away. Its almost impossible to not speak, much less not feel hurt when you hear them speak to others without you. Which I have to do everyday in science class when she sits with her new best friend right behind me. I try so hard not to care, you don't even know how hard, but no matter what I tell myself, I know I care. We know who the other is more than anyone else does. We've had more sleepovers, more long talks, more secrets than with anyone else. We can't just sever off that part of us thats been alive and thriving for years, but obviously slowly started to die out lately. But its still there, throbbing and aching for someone to take that place inside of us again. I know I can address the wound and it will heal one day, but no one can replace her, and she'll find no one can replace me. Cause we're the only us there is around.&nbsp; 

Well this is pretty long, so I'll stop for now, but I'll write more later, cause I have a lot to write."

"event","Hi LJ!

I was rereading my most recent blogs and I have to say they're quite melancholy. It's not that I really am this somber pessimistic person, but I think it's actually very therapeutic to write out how I'm feeling. I'm not particularly close with anyone anymore. That sounds depressing, but it's actually not. When you grow up, if you aren't married or you're not raising children, I don't think it's really possible to be that open with anyone. I also think my geographical location has a lot to do with my lack of ability or desire to relate to people. As I've said before, I could attempt to open up and pour my soul out of the urn but considering the criticism and ""I'm sorry to hear's"" I think I do better this way.

Still working at the old car factory. It isn't a bad job but it's certainly not a career. When people ask me if I'm going to retire there I usually respond with something along the lines of ""God, I hope not."" It's a void. There are no real embellishing and pretty words to make it more glamorous than what it is. You can't really have a <i>real</i> life outside because of the ridiculous hours and finding people who can work around your crazy schedule is hard to come by. I understand now the reasons for all the affairs and coworker relationships but I can't indulge. If I were to hookup with anyone at work I'd wither. I get bored so easily and I tire of talking about work or even thinking about it when I'm not there. Hell, I don't like thinking about it when I <b>AM</b> there. I think I need to start bringing my notebooks to work. That way, when I'm at my desk I can start writing down bits and pieces of stories I've had rattling around in my brain for awhile. I love to write. It's my passion, but like anything else when it comes to me, I get distracted so easily.

I've also come to realize I've been far too tolerant of conflict breeding individuals. I don't know why it is I fall so easily for aggressive and cold men. I haven't been respecting myself the past 5 years by allowing myself to be treated so horribly. I <b>am</b> a forgiver, but I don't think I can keep reconciling myself to being verbally abused and treated like a come and go commodity. I'm a soul with thoughts and feelings. Apparently, if you have tits and and female genitals you <i>deserve</i> to be treated shamefully if you aren't submissive...yeah, fuck that. 

I'm getting a pretty fat check this weekend (or so I've been told). I'm going to put most of it back for my continued house hunting, but I think I'll use some of it for a vacation. I work too much. I never take off. I always make the excuse that because I'm a young single woman that I need the money (which I really do) but still...life is far too short and as far as I know we only get one. I need to have fun. Not sure where I'll end up for memorial weekend but it's sort of become a tradition for me to take an extra long weekend. I need to stop taking guys on trips with me that try to make moves though. It gets old and predictably boring. I just HATE when people think just because there are two people off the opposite sex that there <i>has</i> to be some type of romantic or sexual chemistry there. Can you not just have fun with zero expectations? Can you not just have a few drinks without assuming or hoping it might lead to something else? 

I tell you one thing, there is nothing more positively euphoric than sitting outside on a starry night somewhere with a cold drink and a cheerful conversation about anything and everything. That's why I want a house, LJ. I want a back porch I can sit on with a beer or mixed drink in hand, and truly enjoy the company and creation around me. It's the simple things, but I'll be damned if the simple things aren't ridiculously impossible to accomplish. Well, gotta get ready for work, liebling. 

Vielen Dank,

I'm thinking too much again, but I can't really force it away. I wish there was a way I could get peace. I've accepted how things are but I can't find the cheer in it. ""Look at the glass half full"" they always say. Sometimes I do, but there's still a lot of fresh wounds that aren't healing. What am I doing wrong? I've prided myself in this personal evolution but there's a heavy compromise. The memories linger. I can't will them away but I hate to involuntarily dwell on them. I've made the necessary changes. I've sacrificed what I wanted for the sake of doing what's right. And let's face it, doing the right thing is a heavy weight to carry. No one else understands it so they can't empathize and it just...sucks. I'm not miserable.  It may sound that way, but I'm not. I'm just detached and I can't relate anymore. It's a deep exhale and an onslaught of questions I have the answers to and I don't know where to go from here. What should I do? I don't want to relive past mistakes. I just want to recover. How am I going to get through this, LJ? Just you,  and me, and the trinity.  The going is rough and I don't see a win in the near future, but I'm hopeful. Fortunes change,you must believe.

"event","Well LJ,

It looks like it's been another freaking year!!! You want to know the truth? The real reason I fell off the map was because I was getting anonymous comments and had a pretty good inclination as to whom they might be coming from, but I digress. How've I been? Meh. That one bland little word pretty much hits the nail on the head. I'm ok...not great, not terrible...just ok. To be perfectly sincere I'm very empty these days. I think I've lost the ability to be comfortable around anyone I can't relate to, and let's face it, I can't relate to <i>anyone</i> anymore. Have you ever poured your guts out to someone just have them regard you with cold disinterest or apathy? That's what's happened to me. 

I've grown very weary of it. I want to look someone in the eyes and see a keen sense of interest in them when I'm speaking. I want to know they <b>WANT</b> to hear what I have to say. I can't find anyone that genuinely cares and that deeply disconcerts me. My God! I've completely forgotten how much of a relief it is to exert exactly how I'm feeling and what I'm thinking into writing. I've missed this, LJ. I've missed this electronic telepathy we have. I know when I write this out you're not going to stare back at me blankly with cold indifference. I can say whatever I have to and you just accept it. I love the ease with which this comes to me. 

I've done it all, you know. I've sat in doctor's offices and told my story. I've spoken to strangers about it. I've spoken to ""friends"" about it. I've spoken to holy men about it. I've told them all, and yet I felt no sense of relief. It actually felt worse to give someone the KNOWLEDGE of what I've been thinking and what I've felt and just know that they hadn't at all <i>heard</i> anything I said. You cry a hundred thousand tears and what happens? People don't want to empathize. They don't want to comfort you. They want you to make THEM feel comfortable. They don't want to deal with your soul. They don't want to <i>see</i> your soul. They just want to see your body. They just want to see your emotions. They just want to see what's easy for them to write off, but no one wants to peer inside your heart and really reach out to you. It takes a far greater amount of effort and talent to see a person's soul. I think only a handful of people out there are capable.

I'm ok, LJ. I'm struggling. I'm struggling because I realize I have to jump this hurdle alone. I realize now that people don't want to understand, but I'm alright, you know. I've made it a habit of blocking people I no longer think should be a part of my daily existence. I believe social media, text messages, and this new fangled impersonal world we live in makes friendship and love far too casual for my liking. I think it's high time those who want to be a part of my life make it known. I'm ok...I'm just wandering for now. 

I want to start writing more. I want to express myself more freely. I need to exert this energy that's festering inside me. I think I'm going to make this a habit no matter WHO comments on it. And if anyone out there is going to comment on my thoughts and my words from the discrete safety of anonymity than I suggest you make yourself known or I will otherwise disable those comments. In any case this feels pretty liberating. I want to divulge myself more openly into this. I know I've said so before but I really need this. I'll write back soon, LJ. Hold it down for me.

"event","Hi little livejournal. I've come to really like posting my thoughts here. I can't really express myself to a person very well...i've never been particularly good at that. It's always been easier to communicate through written text for me. And I guess it's easier here, because a computer isn't going to be overly critical of me. It isn't going to tell me that I'm being too emotional or that I take everything to heart when I shouldn't. I'm going to click and post and that's going to be the end of it. In a way, I'm really happy none of my friends read this anymore. I like the intimacy of this. I love the fact that it's so personal. And it's nice having someone to talk to...in a manner of speaking. 

I'm very sad, little journal. A sad fool. I've come to take reality with a grim acceptance, but there's too much I don't understand. I think I'm stripped of all my innocence. I wish I could get a fraction of it back...I wish I could be carefree again. I wish I could live in a dream land. I wish I could still believe that there are ways to achieve your goals without compromising something along the way. You can't...people are inevitably corrupt. The bottom line to everything goes back to how much of yourself you're willing to sacrifice. I can't compromise my values...because doing that comes back to haunt you. Being immoral hurts oneself more than it does anyone else. And I learned years ago that sin actually does affect everyone. I don't want to hurt other people.

""Fortunes change, you must believe"" That's a quote from one of my characters from an original story...one I've never gotten from poetry to novel. That metamorphosis is hard. It's hard to focus. But really...as corrupt as the character that said that is...he's right I think. Fortunes do change, but when? I'm getting older now. I know what I want. More than anything. I could care less about money. Fancy cars, furniture, homes...I don't care about all that. I'll make do with what I have. I just want people who care in my life. But these days those kind of people are conspicuously absent. I'm trying to be a better person. I'm trying so hard to resist bad things. I've stopped believing lies, I've stopped entertaining fantasies, and all I'm trying to do is find a little bit of sunshine. It's harder than it looks. 

I'm not in desolation or anything. I'm just disappointed in people. There's so many gentlemen friends that have really let me down in recent times. Empty promises, blatant lies, the usual lines ""I really value our friendship""...but what he's really more interested in is busting his nut. *Sigh* It gets old. The lies get old. The facades get old. I'm getting old. I'm getting tired. Just yesterday a good friend at work, whom I always kid around with playfully, was adamantly trying to get my #. It really crushed me. Why, you ask? Because he's married with 3 kids and always brags about his devotion and love for them. It upset me because I was shocked he'd really try that. What's so wrong about asking for a number? It's inappropriate for someone who's married. I'm sure his wife wouldn't appreciate that and the saddest part about it is...that happens to me all the time. When you think you can let your guard down and really have fun and be open with someone that drop that bomb. Lust or boredom. He's getting antzy. They come to me because they think I'm an opportunity. A nice distraction. I've come to realize that's all i am to them. 

Girls don't want to be friends. It always has to be a competition with ANYTHING. So pretty much all my friends are guys...it's just getting difficult. When one of them subtly drops a line or makes a lewd comment it hurts me because that trust isn't there anymore. My really good friends don't live in the area, the state, or some of them even in this country. I miss them :( I miss my Canadian friends, my Japanese friends, and my old friends from college who've all moved on and have little families of their own. I wish not everything I got attached to had to leave. I'm really lonely little LJ. I need to pray more but its so hard now. It's hard to believe that fortunes really will change. Can God really let me move on? I've done some pretty terrible things and you know and I know I've had to pay for them. I've learned! I really have! I'm trying so hard to be better. I just want someone to need me...that's all. It doesn't have to be romantic. Just good honest people who care. 

I hope the next two nights at work go by quickly. I'm ready for the weekend. Hope to be in touch again real soon LJ. Maybe I'll have a sunnier post next time :) Let's pray for sunshine in my life! Fortunes will change...maybe soon. I sure hope so. Until next time!"

"event","I don't understand. I don't understand people. At all. Why are people nihilists? Why can they not be happy with the simple pleasures of life? It's not fair. I'm envious of them. The people with families...the people with spouses and children...the people with something to go home to...they're all so sickeningly selfish. How can you cheat on someone who's been faithful to you? How can you fuck someone and tell them you love them and then get into bed with your husband and wife that same night? How CAN YOU DO THAT?!!! How is it fair that they get to have their cake and eat it too? Be strong, wives! Be strong husbands!! Leave them! I know I would...Who wants to stay in a miserable loveless relationship ""for the sake of the kids"" or because they want to ""work things out"" One mistake can be forgiven. But turning a blind eye to infidelity because you're afraid to be alone is ridiculous! You'd be surprised what strength you possess. 

It breaks my heart. To hear about people in marriage counseling and the same shit keeps recycling itself over and over again. Why waste the money if you know you're not going to change? Why live a lie? I don't get it. Why entertain a false fantasy? Do you not know that a fantasy is just that? It's imaginary. People are pretty painted shells on the outside...but on the inside we've all got our ugliness and dark ambitions. The secret to love...is ACCEPTING the stripped, ugly, dark, and frightening dimensions inside the other entity and loving them anyway. Beauty fades, sex is empty without the passion, and we're all made of dust anyway. I wish I could find a person who finds beauty in souls instead of lust in a shell body. 

I'm getting tired. Tired of all this corruption. Be thankful for people who love you. Be thankful for your beautiful children (the ones who carry on your legacy) Be thankful that you have something besides alcohol to kiss you goodnight. You know it says in the book of Ecclesiastes that by sad countenance the heart is made better..and the day of a man's death is happier than the day of his birth. I'm beginning to find meaning in that verse. Not that I'm anxious to die or anything..for my own reasons...but I really do believe that the wisest souls are the souls that have been in mourning. Everything I hope in time will come..."

"event","I am STARVING right now. I don't need to go livestock and start eating just for the hell of it though. I've gotten fat enough as it is (10 lbs fatter to be exact) and it's beyond annoying. I guess I stopped thinking about weight gain when I LOST all that weight this summer with the anxiety and depression streak. It really got to me when people kept asking at an alarming rate why I was dropping weight rapidly. The pains of emotional strife have never mixed well with my physical being and I tend to drop weight over any stress. After I forced myself into perseverance I started eating again and now it's definitely starting to show...much to my chagrin. The crunches and kamakaze work out will just have to resume. 

*Sigh* On another note the big sis and her family are going back to Canada early next week and I regret that I've not gotten to spend hardly any time with them. I'm happy I got to attend the little niece and nephy boo's birthday bash and my niece's baptism and a sunday luncheon at my grandmother's with the whole fam...but with my job it really wasn't possible to spend as much time as I would've wanted. It's not easy taking care of every day expenses on your own. The cost of living...yeah just the amount it takes to keep you alive and breathing is way too much these days. It's the life I keep choosing though. 

My stomach really does feel like it's about to turn over and eat itself though. Hummmmmmm :////// I need to start back on my fanfiction...and keep adding to my collection of original works. Time...time and focus. Two things I don't have a lot of these days that are mandatory for that type of creativity. Well, I'll go ahead and add to my infinite list of things that seriously need more diligence from me. I gotten way to comfortable with apathy these days. This calloused exoskeleton I've developed could really use a soft touch. 

Until next time, darling dear :)"

Not that i hate working nights, in fact, they're my favorite. Tonight was just one of those nights everyone decides to try pushing my bitch buttons. BUT ANYWAY, what's going on with me? Well work is work. It pays the living expenses so i'm not going to sit around crying about that. I leave that shit at the turnstile when I badge out...well most of the time. He's back in my life again. Yep. My forever whatever. I sensed he'd come back. He's so predictable. I ask him to hit the door and that I'm better off and he always finds a way to come back.He'd follow me to the ends of the earth. I'm totally shutting down my emotions on this because I don't know where to go with it anymore. It's been 3 years now. 3 years since we started our history and 9 years since we met. He's got the Peter pan syndrome, and me? Well, I just have the proud stubborn independent woman streak. I don't know how I feel anymore. I'm gonna pray because that's all i know to do at this point and take it day by day. On another note this apartment is starting to get to me. My lease is up in a little over a month anyway. I've looked at a duplex near downtown and i'm considering it. Perhaps the landlord will negotiate with me on a few things. I'll probably head that way after I wake up this afternoon to drop off my app. Pray for good tidings for me, liebling. Oh by the way did you know Ich spreche Deutch? Well....i do. Moderately. It's something I've picked up the past couple of years. I can joke with the Japanese guys at work too but not very much. I would NOT say I'm comfortable even speaking it moderately but they say my pronunciation is pretty top notch.

"event","Well it's already Sunday and I don't know why but I'm starting to regress back into an old state of loneliness, isolation, self worth issues, and depression. I'm trying really hard to fight off so many temptations and frankly I'm sick to death of it. I'm trying to be a better person, a better human being, and a better friend to people but every time I try so hard to rise above it all these awful temptations manifest themselves constantly and it's really really hard to say no sometimes. I find I'm having to detach myself from people altogether these days and it's really starting to take a toll on my mental health. I want...no I NEED to be social but I can't be around people who just want to take whatever they can get from me. Sometimes, in my heart, I feel the darkest desires overwhelm me and I have no choice but to completely pull away completely. It's not that I don't care...it's not that I don't like them but I can't live with thoughts and the guilt that would haunt me forever. 

I'm already struggling with these nightmares...the same ones that threaten me week after week. Either loved ones of a person I've given into harass me or I end up being dragged into hell and hear the sins repeating over and over again in my head while the ones I loved dearly turn their backs on me. I can't take the burning in hell dream...I hear that voice in my head sometimes and i can't take it. ""you're going to hell Amber. You'll burn for what you've done"" 

So I completely separate myself from it. I want so badly to be close to someone. During the week it isn't so bad. I hear from my friends and I stay fairly preoccupied at work. It's always the weekends that get to me, though. I want to go out...I miss going out. But all the places I used to enjoy are infested with things or men that would ask of me what I can't succumb to. I really hope God hears me. I'm sorry that I don't pray as much as I should or go to church like I know I need to...but I hope he understands I'm trying really hard and I'm struggling desperately. I need to be inspired by goodness...are there no good souls left in the world? Is everyone out to take what they can get?"

I suppose I'm still a hot head but all in all I'm a lot less quick to rant about things of childish nature (i've progressed to whining about things beyond my control these days) So where should I begin? Let's see obviously the previously mentioned boyfriend I lived with is no longer in the picture. I moved back to my home state of Mississippi over 3 years ago and I've been through some pretty tumultuous relationships and situations. It's hard to believe I'm the same girl that sat around all day crying about part time jobs and annoying not quite ""in-laws"". My how the years do fly. These days I like to believe I'm a little more level headed and less likely to throw childish tantrums (although it does still happen periodically) I'm an employee of a decent paying automobile manufacturing company and I'm learning to appreciate the single life and my own strengths on a much deeper level.

I find it rather depressing that I haven't had time to fill you in on how my life is progressing. Well as you know I've been in North Carolina for over a year now! So I'm happy to share that one of my goals is fulfilled anyway. (Getting the hell out of Mississippi) 

So my older sister is pregnant and I'm going to be an Aunt. I guess I'm excited, but I doubt I will be getting to see my little nephew hardly ever since, you know, Celeste lives up in Canada and so forth. She and I aren't really speaking right now anyway. I can hardly call it my fault though. She needs to understand that not everything revolves around her and that there's more to life than what she wants and when she wants it. I wish her the best of luck in everything she does but I don't think her dreamworld with this new marriage and baby will last. Reality has got to rear its ugly head at some point and I honestly don't think she'll be ready when the time comes for it.

I've been writing a lot more recently but every time I get started on a new story I can't seem to continue it. It's like I just get a lack of enthusiasm and it lays unattended somewhere forever only to be discovered years later. I really wish my brain would stop over analyzing things and just stick to one thing at a time. This is why I never finish anything. Because I can't concentrate on one thing at a time...it's like I try but I get distracted with something else, so I find myself trying to finish 3 things at once. 

I can't live up to my own expectations and its killing me. I'm my biggest critic and I'm kind of a hard ass. Things at work haven't been going favorably either. I'm tired of filling in for people who don't want to work on weekends or with people they are uncomfortable with. In the end I'm the one who always ends up filling in for them and I've just about had it with all the bullshit that's been going down at the store. But as they say no good deed goes unnoticed and no bad one goes unpunished. Karma is a bitch and I hope for those lazy fuckers that she's on the rag soon. Anyway, I have a lot to be doing if I want to accomplish my new goals (finish some of my fiction and copyright and publish it) As well as move out of Jonah's parents house soon. Well adieu my friends, for that handful that might actually read this."

I don't understand how some people can be so selfish. They have hardly spent anytime with us and my sister and her new husband have both been selfish freaking pricks since they got here. I'm beginning to feel as though I have officially emancipated myself from them altogether. They never consider anyone but themselves and I guess my fiance and I are just dead weight. Fine by me.

I mean seriously, some people seriously need to grow the hell up and act like a mature adult. I really think some people never really get over themselves and for the past few days its been driving me insane just thinking about it. But you know what, livejournal? I pity them. People like that never go anywhere in life. They never progress. Why you may ask. Its simple really. Because they never learn to evaluate themselves. 

It made me so angry at first, but now...It really is just so damn pathetic. Grown adults act this way. What a depressing thing it is. Some people live their whole lives miserably because they can't understand why people don't agree with everything they say. Well you know what loser...that's life. NOBODY agrees with everything you say. And the people who don't disagree to your face are just humoring you so you'll shut up and go away. How sad to live your life that way. But luckily for you...I'm not angry anymore. I gave someone so many chances to prove to me they weren't a jackass. But I gave them one too many chances. So you know what...I forgive you for being the way you are. But when you are old and useless in your age, and all alone you'll hate yourself for what you've done to people who have tried. So all in all you were a cunt, you are a cunt, and you will forever be...a fucking cunt until you learn to check yourself. I'm over it."

"event","Yesterday I worked out really hard. Ran on the treadmill my usual amount of time and that weight lifting thing for a bit. I'm really sore today. I've been working out more lately. Jonah and I usually do it together in the gym downstairs. It's just so incredibly hard to get up the next morning. I didn't even go to class today. I just slept for an additional 3 hours, and Kakoli and Kenny are getting on my last nerves. Kenny is just being his normal stupid self and being picky about generally anything and talking about Bangladesh non-stop. Just for the record unless you wanna here about Bangladesh for like 2 hours straight and how much better it is than America, don't talk to Kenny. Not only that but I'm fucking sick of his laziness lately. Here Jonah and me are busting our asses trying to get a job and he completely takes advantage of his all the time. He shows up late almost everyday now, he complains about how much he hates it, and expects his son to find him another on the internet. How hard is it to drive around Burlington one day and just go looking. 

Hopefully now they are realizing how much of a waste that stupid trip to Bangladesh was. Kenny probably could have had a good job if they had waited until December to go. They talked about how broke they were with the bills and then just blew 3,000 dollars on plane tickets. If they were so dead broke to begin with then how the hell did they afford that? And now they are even worse. Because Kenny got lazy and wouldn't keep going to his second job but one day a week so they let him go for someone more regular. His wife got him another second job at pizza hut and he ""didn't like it"" so he quit after a few days. So now he has no second job and they still complain about money. SHUT THE FUCK UP. seriously. My god...if you are so broke you'll get whatever job you can take. He's gonna get fired for being so lazy with his day job and then we'll see how it goes. 

As For Kakoli...what can I say? She has had a bad attitude lately and I am frankly sick of hearing it. I dont' want anything to do with her for awhile and I just want to find a good job to pay our bills. Jonah is looking too. Stupid fucking Bangladesh. Screw that place and that trip they went on. We'd all be better off if they hadn't gone on it to begin with."

One of these days I'll get a job and buy myself an old truck like I've been dying to for the past few years. I applied at food lion online today. I'm thinking maybe it would be better to go apply in person thought. I'm also going to apply at Pilot Travel centers. It wouldn't be too bad of a job. I'm not even going to be picky these days. Its not like I know anyone up here. I could really care less. I'm not too proud for any job anymore. 

I always was a hard working individual. Whether anyone would like to believe it or not. I enjoy making my own money and working for it. I'm an ambitious woman. I don't like my man to always buy everything for me while I sit around. I can't stand it. I honestly don't know how women do that. It's so insane. You sit on your ass all day while your husband puts food on the table, pays all the bills, and works his self to the bone? I'm sorry. I just can't do that though. I was never meant to be a housewife. It's not for me. I'm just working woman who equally puts in as much work as her man.

My sister is moving to Canada. Blah. I say she doesn't know what she is doing. She's rushing off into another relationship again. As usual. Who can tell her anything though? It's just a lesson she will have to learn on her own. Ah well. I have work to do now. I'll be back later though!

Muah!

Its only like 15 minutes away from our house and thankfully I'm only taking 4 classes this semester. All of which I should have no problem with. Developmental psychology is already looking pretty easy. I really like my teacher and the class is very small. Only about 12 of us in there. Art appreciation is looking to be pretty boring, but nothing seriously hard. Hell, its not even going to be a challenge. By the way, my art teacher's name is Mr. Fishman. I'm not joking either. You say it just like that. Fish-Man. I could not contain myself when he introduced himself. He was like, My name is Mr. Fishman...don't laugh. Its not funny. And then everyone did. Let's see American Literature looks like its going to be pretty boring too. But I doubt I'll have any troubles academically, maybe just trying to stay awake. And as for my speech class...well I actually like it. My teacher is awesome and so are the people in the class. I'm looking forward to this year. A new start. A new school. A new life.

"event","I cannot begin to contain myself. Just 10 more days!!! Ten more days and my Jonah will be back from Bangladesh!! I am so excited no one understands. He has been gone for 3 weeks and it has been an absolute hell for me. The first day he left I could not stop crying, that night in our bed, I felt as though there was a hole forming in my heart. He wasn't beside me and he wouldn't be with me for a month. It was as though the happiness that my heart had finally found was abruptly stolen away right before me. I had never known such emptiness in all my being. The next few days weren't any better. My mental state was all but stable. I cried constantly and found myself regurgitating everything I ate (and no it was not done intentionally) I just couldn't keep anything in my stomach. 

Then the next night I was rushed in an ambulance to some hospital I had never heard of before. I remember being alone. Completely and utterly alone in an emergency room on an oxygen mask crying. No one was there. I had no one to call to pick me up, no one to talk to, and my husband was over seas somewhere unable to do anything and just crying FOR me. I hate that day. I really wish God would just erase that day from existence. July 5, 2007 is not a night I ever want to remember, but one that will haunt me for the rest of my life. The one night God turned away from me. I have no idea what Jesus went through the night he was betrayed and left die alone...but I will say I have a better understanding of it now.

Over the past few weeks I have been sleeping on Patrick's couch. Calling Jonah constantly to see if he was ok on the other side of the world. I hate not being able to talk to him whenever I want to. Its the worst feeling in the world. But like I said its only ten more days now. And I know that I have to be strong for the remainder of this time. I really believe some kind of evil spirit had been plaguing me for the past few weeks. And once my best friend, my family, and Jonah and I started praying together...it was like I woke up one day and the sickness that I had was just lifted. I eat like I used to and I act like my old self again. I really think this was some kind of test from God. My weakness was really put to the test, but I know I can handle anything if I have God on myside. So bring on the clouds, bring on the lightning, bring on the thunder...I know if I let go and I let God, I know that I will be the successor. I've done my time in purgatory...its almost time for my release."

But how am I supposed to spend my days without my Jonah here? We are pretty much married already, ya know. I won't be able to sleep because he's not going to be beside me. I won't wake up to his dark eyes first thing in the morning. He won't make that strange coffee-tea and Kakoli and Kenny won't drill me about eating unhealthy. I am so fucking depressed. These 3 weeks cannot fly by fast enough.

My heart is wrenching. When they left the driveway early this morning...I stared until I couldn't see them anymore. Then ran upstairs and cried...literally holding onto myself tightly until I collapsed. I mean I know its just their vacation..but they are overseas now. Someone I don't know. Somewhere I can't be. Somewhere I don't understand things. In a third-world country. I just hate the damned thought of it. It makes my stomach cringe. I feel faint now. I really need someone to talk to.

"event","I think starting today I am going to be updating my livejournal more frequently. I think I'm just going to keep an online diary of my life in North Carolina these days. Its been awhile since I have really recorded anything at all here, and its really so much more personal than myspace. So I think I'll begin right now. I'm sure no one reads this anyway, and even if they do I really don't mind. NC is everything I have hoped for and so much more. In case you were wondering, I live with Jonah and his parents in their ""3 story"" doll house looking home. Its really beautiful out here. I have my own room but I always sleep with Jonah. And YES, his parents know we do. That's how much they adore me. At first I thought me and Miss Anna were going to be the worst of enemies. We are EXACTLY alike, and I'm so not exaggerating. They already consider me a daughter. Isn't that just wonderful?

Jonah still works front desk at a hotel in Greensboro but he's quitting this weekend because they will be going to Bangladesh in July. And I'll be here. No, that doesn't bother me, but I will miss them all tremendously. I mean, they are my family you know. I can't say that It doesn't worry me at times but since Jonah and I have already been down the road of not seeing each other for months at a time I suppose 3 weeks isn't really that big of a deal at all. It will pass by in the blink of an eye. You should hear my bengali mum right now. She's singing in Hindi (indian not bangla) its really beautiful. I am currently looking for a job around Mebane, but I think it will be another week before I get any call backs because of the online shit. Doesn't bother me. I'm really very happy.

Sometimes I do get a little homesick, I won't even try to deny it. I miss my family a great deal. And I call them on a weekly basis. I really wasn't trying to escape Mississippi like everyone claims. I had just had enough of the same horizon and needed a change. I got what I wanted. I have all I could ever want. I really do. Its not like I have a car anymore. My dad said I couldn't take it up here because it would be too much trouble. So now I don't have a vehicle, but that's what I'm getting a job for. I mean, honestly most kids would probably be ripping their hair out right now. To be honest with you, I came up with with only 3 bags. 3 bags, and that was all I had to my name. A few shoes, some clothes, and a few picture frames. That was all I brought with me. All I had to make a new life with. And I tell you, as sure as the sun sets in the sky, I could not be any happier. 

I love my life. I love my families (both of them), I love my friends up here. I am finally at peace. For anyone who ever believed I could do it, I commend you. I've gotten to where I am today, because of your support. I am who I am because you helped me find out what I was. For anyone out there who tried to bring me down. Whether you set out to hurt me, or you just didn't give a fuck anymore I should thank you. You've made me stronger. You've made me wiser. You've made me see the world as it is. You can all stay in your little box for the rest of your lives. You can bicker and bitch and gossip to your gaggle of geese all day, every day for as long as your would like. That's all you'll ever have. As for me, I intend to be so much more. I'm the shifting sand, and you're a hardened stone."

"event","So its been about 6 months sine i have updated this thing. I really need to stay in touch with livejournal. I've been neglecting this little bugger for awhile. Lol! School has been going pretty well I guess. I dropped my biology class because i just knew i would end up not going half the time and since i'm looking for a second job I really would like to have more time to myself at least during the day. I haven't been home in over a month and honestly it really doesn't bother me. Its not like its a big deal or anything. I feel glad that I have my dorm to go to. I like being independent and having my own place to go to. So, this month on the 21st of February Jonah and I will have dated for 6 months. thats half a year. It makes me really happy. I'm so glad we're so close now. We talk about everything together. There's probably not one thing we haven't really talked about to some extent. He's my best friend as much as he is my boyfriend. So, thank God he's in my life. I've been through some heavy depression the past few weeks as well. What with his parents calling me up and threatening, and then staying on his case. Its been hard. Its been really hard. I'm really glad my friends were there to help me. I don't think I would have made it if Jonah, Vanessa, and Miranda hadn't been there. Jonah was there the best he could be. Vanessa was always there the second I needed her and so was Miranda. 

Then there's the whole issue of me moving to NC next year. I'd be lying if I said I'm not nervous, but the thing is I know everything is going to work out. I'm really excited about it actually. I'll be with my baby and at the same time making new friends and not depending on anyone besides myself. I think sometime next week i'm going to tell my parents about me moving up there. Its going to be hard but I know I have to face the music sometime. I might as well do it now. So, me and Vanessa were talking about our weddings and the colors and the bridesmaids. I really think I want my colors to be scarlet and creme. I just think that would be so gorgeous. Jonah said that Patrick would be his best man for the american wedding and Jon G. would be the one for our Bengali one. You know I've been thinking alot lately and...well I'm glad I've decided to wait until marriage before I lose my virginity. I know how much Jonah loves me. I know because he was right on top of me when he came down last time.

Neither of us were dressed at all. I know this is really personal but hell, its not like anyone will read it anyway. So we were both completely bare. All over each other, and he just looked into my eyes and said, ""baby, you are so worth the wait. I'd wait forever for you sweetheart"" and when he said that I couldn't help but cry. I knew I had found the man I would marry. Honestly what other guy would have said that? What other guy wouldn't have pushed through? That's how I know Jonah is really in love with me. If it had been anyone else they would have taken advantage of the situation. But not my jonah. And I knew that before we even started really making out like that. I knew I could trust him like that. I know I can trust him completely. I can tell him anything.I can trust him with my virginity, and I can trust him with my life. All I can do is thank God in heaven for finally answering my prayers. I waited 5 years for the right man to come into my life, 5 years of rejection, tears, and prayer and it finally paid off. I'm so proud of myself for not giving in to any guy. Thank God for giving me morality and determination"

"event","Hello Hello all my lovely little darlings. I hope everyone is doing fabulously. I realize that it has definitely been sometime since I last updated this thing. I really don't understand why I have made a habit out of neglecting this little site of mine. In any case I think I should let you all know that things are actually going very well. And for the first time in my life...I can honestly say I am ""IN"" love. Can you believe it? Me of all people? In love!! But I recognize it for what it is and I am the happiest I have ever been. I remember telling people countlessly, time after time, again and again how I loved them but I was never truly ""in"" love with them. And yet here I am eighteen years old...head over heels. I have never had this kind of passion, this burning desire, this overwhelming bliss as I am experiencing now with my Jonah. My man of Bengali descent...my beautiful lova love. lol! I miss him horribly now though. After last weekend he went back to Carolina and I of course am here. But he'll back next month during the second weekend. I'm very excited!!! This is me people. Think about it. Little miss virginity, independence, conquester of the narrow minded, madly in love. And the best part is...he loves me for it. He respects me, he cherishes me, he loves me for who I am and everything I stand for. God grant us a happy ending! The best thing ever has happened. I'm moving on with life and leaving my immaturity behind. I'm a woman now. 18 and ready to conquer. Bring on the torrents and darkness. Love will light the way and cut through all uncertainty. So we have it all planned out right? Me and Jonah. Neither one of us were like this to begin with. We were both so skeptical of what we had. We thought if anything it would be years before we ever got to the point of actually loving each other and seeing each other. Now we pretty much consider each other our spouses. He's just like an argumentative self-righteous husband and I a bitching and also argumentative wife. But...we're so crazy about each other. The degree of our desire for each other is so fucking immeasurable. God, I miss him damn it! Needless to say, I'll see him soon enough. His dark skin of bangladesh heredity, his coal dark eyes...almost onyx, his perfectly white straight teeth, his long jet black hair, his sculpted strong frame, his rich warm laughter, and his terribly wicked and sometimes dry sense of humour. All in all I miss my baby. I really do. So Jonah baby, when ya gonna come up and see me again sometime?"

Adam is the best thing thats happened to me in awhile and all I can say is that I love spending so much time with him. We always find interesting things to do together and it seems like we never run out of things to talk about. And when i'm in his arms...i just feel safe. I feel like no one can touch me when I'm with him. He's so kind and thoughtful. He always tell me how beautiful he thinks i am and he's always begging to pay for everything. (I put up quite the fight though) My only hope now is that he and I get even closer as time progresses. He and I...we're inseperable...And HE NEVER forgets to call me."

Anywho I know I've been accepted into Northeast Mississippi community college! whoohoo! lol, I'm kinda proud of myself. I mean hey, I was questioning, at one point, whether or not I was even going to graduate. But did and everything fell into place. I am just really glad everything has gone the way it has and, even though I have my regrets, all I can do now is look ahead and go on with my life. I have no idea what God has in store for me in the future...but I have a feeling, within the next few years of my life something great will happen. I feel refreshed and new,I feel like I have a chance to start everything over and just...have a second chance. I'm really grateful. Other people may think that its a sad time because the people I grew up with will never all be together again. But to me...its like I get to start somewhere new and make a new name for myself. I really want to take advantage of this. Thank you Master, for everything. Amen, Amen, Amen!"

I don't know. All he said yesterday was how he thought i was beautiful and how he thought my legs were gorgeous (sounds kinda like cada) but he's a very nice guy and he's so sweet and adorable.

"event","OK livejournal. I love you. Sorry I haven't updated this thing in like forever. I've just been preoccupied and whatnot. Anyway, Since no one reads this i'm going to do a little bit of bitching on this thing. Fasten your seatbelt kids, this is gonna be hard to swollow. Some of you people need to get a fucking grip on life. I'm not saying i'm an expert or anything but damn, for the love of all things beautiful stop your fucking whining. Stop bitching about how no one understands any of you. Tough luck. No one really will ever truly understand you. I'm not sure we even understand ourselves at times. If you don't know whats going on with you how can you expect anyone else in the world to. I'm sick of all of your philosophical meaningless bullshit on life. None of us know anything about life yet, including myself. We're so misguided thinking we need to have all the answers to everything in one day...like its just going to pop right into our heads and we'll finally grasp the intangible wisdom on the meaning of love, pain, sorrow, and joy. You learn from experience ok. You learn things from your mistakes, or other people's mistakes. You don't learn if you keep doing the same thing over and over and over again knowing it didn't work the first, second, or third time. Stop running in circles, stop sitting in the same place crying waiting for the answer to walk up and introduce itself. It doesn't work that way ok. I know I'm not smart. In fact I'm a stupid, hard-headed, stubborn ass bitch but at least I know sitting on your ass waiting for all the answers isn't going to get you any where. Shut up and take the world head on. You are going to fall...you are going to have trouble picking yourself up and carrying on. But have hope for yourself. If you give up and sit down and cry then don't expect to go anywhere...and don't expect sympathy for it either. Its like a mountain...there is only one way to the top, and it is very difficult to reach it, perilous it seems, almost impossible to climb the distance, but if you fall the don't look down...look to the top, pick yourself up, and keep going until you get there. Though the trip may be long and hard. Believe and you will get there."

I'm not sure how i knew...gift of perception i guess but i knew Timothy was going to be sitting close to me. Well he was. And we didn't talk that much the trip up there. but back was quite a different story. it was all cool til i got the info from my mom that neither she nor daddy were doing well at all. they were both very sick and dad's not getting better. Well after that I just broke down. I just sat in the bus seat and I cried...its the only thing I could do. Then Timothy turned around and grabbed my hand and just held me. I don't know...it felt so right. I didn't want to let him go and he didn't let me go. He just held me close and told me he still loved me. I knew our time wasn't done yet. When we separated it just felt incomplete. I know it sounds weird but I just have this way of knowing, this perception, this knowledge of when something begins...and when it is supposed to end...whether or not people are going to last...when something bad is going to happen. A few weeks ago when Timothy and I broke up it was like I got this feeling. It didn't seem right. It was too sudden and unfinished. I'll know if and when it is ended that it is for good. I'll know. But anyway we are back together and I told him how things were going to be if he really wanted to be with me. He said ok and we made a compromise...I'll loosen up if he grows up. lol. so its all good. we are connected...and everyone is affected. 

Sorry this is my favorite part i've written so far to my story. It seems to go good with this particular moment...

""and eight will be our number"" said Barleme to Annabella
""why shall eight be the number? why will it not be 7? Seven is the number of God."" responded bella
""eight is infinte. It does not end. it is two circles tied together...they go on forever like my love for you...Annabella daughter of Shydarach""
""you love me, sir? A poor horseman's daughter? You are the son of a noble Knighted lord or the dunelands. You are skilled in lore and latin. You should not love a maid who can offer you nothing in return."" said she now gazing into his dark eyes.
""it matters not. My love for you was kindled when first I saw you walking throughout the darkness of this wretched abode. A fallen seraphim from the heavens it seemed you were. My heart was moved...and I could not ever hope to love another as long as my life endured"" he said pleading with his eyes now
""you know this to be true?"" she asked as tiny rivers of salt fell from her sapphire eyes.
""no one has ever dared to love me. no one i thought ever would. i belong to you son of Baradayis. I love you and no one else.""
...And he kissed her beneathe the glistening torches of the caverns in the tomb as the shadows danced around them.'

HOLY FUCKING SHIT! and it was pretty loud too. i know Baronee heard it cuz she told me not to use vulgarities in the store. i got in trouble for that then Ray came up and hugged me and he like touched my ass which was weird but cool because he's 20, he's hot, and he turns me on. anyway work sucks but the stockman is great. later much"

Its so old. but hey i got a pretty check for 250 dollars today not including the pretty little check from baskin robbins of an additional hundred or so i'm gonna get tomorrow. i love being a work-a-holic. It drains time with your friends but you spend more time doing things you get paid for and diciplining yourself. I've learned from over 5 friends of mine it doesn't pay to quit your job and ""take a break"" because when you start needing one again they aren't as easy to find. Luckily for me though my mom and dad don't pay for gas and phone bills so I HAVE to have a job. So I had one before I even quit my job at Baskin Robbins. You know, I'm banished out here to this room again because we have company and my sister's at home. So I'm not allowed in the house and i have no heat out here so i'm freezing my damn ass off. lol. Man, the rules around here are so stupid. But I met this new guy at work today...His name is Ray. Which is weird because thats my dad's name. But anyway, He's like gorgeous. Just guess what he looks like...you got it! My dream guy. He's tall, the blackest hair, tan skin, super gorgeous brown eyes, and his voice is so smooth and sweet. I was like omg forget about depression from a damn broken heart you are fine! lmao. No seriously I think I have a crush on him. I actually look forward to work now. Is that bad? I mean my God he's 20 years old, single, gorgeous to look at, and he's really really nice. What more could you ask for? For once an older guy who appreciates things more than teenage guys. lol. But alas...Alicia has already spotted him and she's like basically throwing herself on him. GGggggrrr. Stupid little huzzy. So what if she's cute and skinny. Oh what the fuck am I saying? He's bound to be like any other guy and get with the first girl that throws herself on him. lol. but i dont know...he was so nice...maybe we'll become friends. I hope so."

You need to start respecting that seriously. At least have the decency not to talk about it ever again. It was your fault and yes i'm still a virgin. duh. i told you that twenty thousand times. you already knew the answer to that one. yes, Wesley went to prison and can't get out on bail. he has a sentence for 2 years in prison. for assault, attemted rape, and other things he's done to other people besides me. Will you stop asking me a certain question? yes. yes yes yes yes yes. i do. I still do ok. I can't help it my situation won't alter until i graduate so you'll just have to deal with the fact that i still go to school there and i still like him. get over it. you don't have anything to worry about. he's over and done with and trust me...the feelings are not mutual. he doesn't care anymore ok. jeez. stop bugging the shit out of me. don't worry about Isaac either. I have a feeling he's pretty pissed at me too. so just chill the fuck out and go on with life. not trying to bitch but stop being paranoid. you're time will come when i'm ready...if i'm ever ready. so don't rush things and take it slowly. i'm not a marilyn i'm a betty jane. men like pretty girls.

My mom is forcing me to go to prom...but I didn't want to go without a date so I invited Cada bug. you should've heard how eccentric he got about the very idea of it. lol. He was like OH OH OH! Fuck yeah! I'm gonna weird out everybody with the beetlejuice tux with the black and white mellos and redye the tips of my hair blue. lol. he says its still blue but i thought it was kinda faded. lol. I'm glad I found a date though. He said he really liked the dress I picked out and he couldn't wait to see me again. Its weird to me. Being with him like that again...as dates. I mean we don't go out its just strange to me the idea of being picked up in that ole truck in a fancy dress. lol. I'm glad we're friends again. Too bad I couldn't go with Timothy...I really miss him alot. I miss my best friend but he doesn't seem like he cares. At least we acknowledge one another. Well bug was the only option for a date and I WAS NOT going to my senior prom without a date. I'd feel so dumb. But then again i have my doubts with Cada. He said something about giving a baby to his lady and I was like...we are NOT doing anything like that. You know how i am. I guess I sorta miss him though. It'll be fun to go crazy again and be stupid like we used to before the mess was made in our relationship. My only weakness is Cada is a gorgeous guy...and I'm not exaggerating. He's by far the best looking guy i've ever been with. He's stunningly got this sex appeal to him...and i know all those girls are going to be all up on him. But he says he's over that stuff. He told me he hadn't had sex for like...what was it? 7 months now. lmfao! Thats a world record for him. I hope he doesn't get all kinky on me. After all...he's an older guy now. 21 to be precise, and he looks better than ever. I'm kind of embarrassed to stand next to him because he's so much hotter than me. lol. But he says i'm cuter now than when i was back when we dated. He acted serious...oh and he promised not to hack into my computer anymore so we'll see how that goes. lol. you know cada, there are such things as comments. If you want to talk...then leave a comment. Don't break into my privacy you douchmonkey bastard. I'll cut it off you ho. lol

I told him everythig. About mine and Timothy's split, about the fact that i was a fling and nothing else, about how hurt i was, and how i didn't feel like going on with everything right now. It was strange to me. He didn't try to get all up on me like he normally does. He just sat beside me and hugged me. Thats all. I think that's all i really want. I just want for someone to be there. And well...he's been there. I just cried on his chest about my friend just dropping me. I'm glad he told me but it was such a lead on. I told Cada I just wanted to run away from it. I was sick of my family, sick of being a fling, and sick of just being an empty space to fill. Suprisingly he just held me...for like an hour and didn't let go while I cried on him. I've never done that with a guy before. Never been able to cry and keep crying. He told me he wasn't going to leave me like everyone else and that I meant more to him than now since he has grown up. He said, ""Amber, I'm 21 years old now. The only thing I ever cared about in high school and my first college years was sex, drugs, and good times with my friends. I never appreciated such a firm foundation that you were and are, I never saw the significance of your person and now I appreciate the person you always were. You haven't changed a bit, and I love you for it."" lol. Can you believe he said that? Well, we talked forever then about 11:30 he took me home and walked me to my door. Then next morning I found a note on my windshield that said I will love you forever and no man will ever love you as much as I do. It was really sweet. lol. I'm not going out with him...at least not now. But maybe after I graduate I will consider it. Its not like whatever he might do hasn't been done to me before. He's the best I can do anyway. *sighs* I'll give in to fate. She put him in my life and won't let him out..."

I asked my master if he would help me with something. I told him I didn't want to grow apart from Timothy and that he meant alot to me. Well, I talked to Timothy and he seemed ok with me. Like he didn't hate me. Well, if he did then he did an awesome job of hiding it. I hope we'll stay good friends anyway. So, Mr. Davidson gave me an extra day on my notecards again. He tried to argue with me about the rise of the iron maiden in early gothic ages and i won. he stared at me and winked. it was halarious. I hope that perv screws some dumb chick and gets her knocked up. lol. that would be so funny. So Cada called me last night dying to tell me he has the highest grade point average in his calculous class. I was like yay for you. lol. He's so smart and yet such a dumbass. He apologized for singing me a sex song on my answering machine and getting me in trouble by my dad. Honestly do guys not ever think? Duh. If you leave an message on the home answering machine my dad's gonna hear it. Dumbass. Well I gotta go work on my notecards for English. oi. oi. oi.

"event","Ok ok ok I know this is really geeky of me but I've been thinking and I really want to try to give myself hope again. I really want it to work. Just a few thoughts...

Love seems like a fable
of folktales growing old

To me it seems intangible
something I could never hold

The years have brought my heart to sadness
and left my spirit broken

Yet in my dreams I've seen a man
bittersweet and yet unspoken

I met a man the other day
a long time friend again received

it seems that there was something more
my eyes could not perceive

His eyes danced, his smile was warm
I'd missed his merry laughter

He held me tight and asked me then
he we could spend some time thereafter

As the time we shared together
brought hope back in my soul

I craved the love of this young man
to make me somehow whole

My mind is warning me to let time pass
but inside I'm tempted once again

To give myself another chance
and allow this feeling to transcend

His name means hebrew laughter
mine means golden jewel

A gem of the trees and sweet laughter
seems like treasures of idealistic fools

But I'll indulge in this profession
and take a chance once more

To let hope prevail in my heart
like it used to long before

"event","Sorry bout the Ren and Stimpy song i think its funny though. HAHAHAHAHAAH. So darlings how are you this Friday morning? I'm pretty good. A little bit sleepy and kinda pissed that I HAVE to have a job. *sighs* I wish I could just take a break from working. Before I even left my job at Baskin Robbins I already had another one waiting. I'm not trying to complain its a good thing I found another one so quickly but I just wish I could've taken a break for at least a week or two. But oh well thats just laziness. lol. I should be more greatful. I'm sorta hungry though. We have like NOTHING to eat here and everyone knows how I eat like a horse and need me some nourishment. lol. So yesterday I went to Isaac's for awhile. I liked it it was really fun. Except for the fact I'm afraid of his little horse in the backyard. I tried my best to stay away from it as much as possible while we were out there. But the weird thing was betty is a really cool dog. Which is ironic for me to say because she's a BIG german shepard. Everyone knows how I feel about those dogs... but she's a pretty dog though and very sweet. Lets see watched Donnie Darko and got confused because I got most of it but I still didn't completely understand alot of it. Really twisted but cool story. I'm hoping tonight and tomorrow night after work I can do a little work on my research paper for english and get some more books. Yep. I'm just tired of doing work and ready for Northeast. Northeast, Northeast, Northeast, Northeast, Northeast!!! wahahhahahhahaha! My mom thinks i'm insane and she wants me to dance with her but I'm not gonna because my legs are really sore from splitting last night on the porch. Mama said I was too fat to do it anymore so I of couse had to go and show her I could still do it and I did like 5 times...which I regret now. Oh well. beauty is pain maybe if I keep doing that my legs will slender up a bit. Hopefully...well gots to go. I love you darlings.

Love and LOTS of Smooches

"event","How you ever felt like you were too plain and unattractive to catch the eye of anyone? Have you ever felt that even when you are with someone they don't find anything about you truly beautiful? Have you ever pretended to be something you weren't just for the attempt in hope that someone will find something within you beautiful and likeable? I have that feeling everday...I have problems with insecurity. I always thought someone would see the real me and find that there is nothing interesting or remotely attracting in my personality. So i cake on the make-up and always hoped they'd see something there...

No Doubt
""Magic's in the Makeup""

Can you tell I'm faking it?
But I wanna be myself
A counterfeit dispostion
Can't be good for my health

So many different faces
depending on the different stages
My personality changes
just like a chameleon

There's more than one dimension
I can fool you to attract attention
Camoflauge my nature
Let me demonstrate...

Makeup's all off
Who am I?
The Magic's in the makeup
So who am I?

If you bore me then I'm comfortable
If you interest me I'm scared
My attraction paralyzes me
No courage to show my true colors that exist
But I want to be the real thing
But if you catch my eye can't be authentic
The one's I loath are the one's that know me the best

My makeup's all off
Who am I?
The magic's in the makeup
Take a wild guess...who am I?

The makeup's all off
so who am I?
If the magic's in the makeup
then who am I?
Magic's in the makeup
But I wanna be the real thing
But all my magic's in my makeup
And I really want to show you

Me without the makeup..."

"event","Good morning darlings. How are you all doing? I'm ok I've been kinda depressed because what do ya know? Looks like I'm single again. But you know what? It'll just be ok. The way I see it is if it wasn't meant to be then it wasn't meant to be. Maybe he just wasn't right for me. Everything happens for a reason though. God knew it was coming and I hate to say it, but so did I. It hurt pretty bad but I'm alot better now. I was so sad when I went in to work yesterday morning. I kept thinking how it wouldn't be the same any more and how I'd have to get used to being me instead of we. Then strangely something great happened. I was just about to take my 15 minute break and low and behold I saw an Isaac creeping about. I ran up to him and hugged him as soon as I saw him. He had come to fill out an application and I had forgotten he said he was coming. I took my break sitting down with him and just talking while he filled it out. It felt good to talk to my old friend face to face again. Afterwards he and I hung out and acted crazy. I think it helped me get off that depression mood and think about something else. We ate, went to his house, drove around lake piomingo, walked out on the docks, and did these random little dances. I did the splits on the concrete (which I thought I couldn't do anymore) it was alot of fun and I think it was good for me. It helped to clear my mind of all the pain and it felt really good to just hug a friend. But alas. Today I work too. Actually I work everday this week except tomorrow. So looks like I'm gonna be busy. lol. Oh well. See you guys around.

"event","Amber,
Hey dollface how are you doing? I'm sorry about your problem. I really am. But you know something? I'm glad that for once you called me. Amber, the last time we talked when you hung up the phone I was afraid that I would never hear your voice again. I really believe in my heart that you and I are supposed to be together. Yes, I've messed up. I've apologized a million times already but this time I really just want you to know something. From the first time I laid eyes on you I got a combination of so many different thoughts. I looked at you and saw a marvelous creature filled with beauty, sadness, innosence, wisdom, and aggression. Then, I got to know you and I realized I had come to know a girl like no other in the world. you are a beautiful feminine engima of confused emotions. But the things that most people dislike about you I had grown to love. Sometimes you lash out, sometimes you cry, sometimes you give all the love that manifests within you, and sometimes you are in too much emotional pain to notice anyone at all. But thats what makes you such beautiful and pleasurable company. I would be the happiest man on earth if I could be so bold as to gain back the love I once lost on account of my stupidity. Call me again Amber. Let me come and see you. I will sweep you off your feet and one day I will marry you. I love you so much my silouette. Let me back into your life. you seem to be drawing back the barriers lately as you've let me call you. I love you.

"event","Do you think it is possible to grow sick from depression? I left school earlier and in a few minutes i'm taking my dad to the neuro surgeon. All i thought about last night as i was taking him back to the doctor how it would effect him if i died. I kept thinking how it would effect Anna and Meghan. I wondered what my little brother would say when he saw me in a casket. I kept thinking about it all last night. I tried to win a battle today. i tried to tell myself i was gonna be ok and that i held a firm foundation. but i am weary and tired. Death seems peaceful and life seems painful. It seems like i am drifting away from those closest to me. I haven't eaten since monday. last night i thought about what mom was making and i even went to go eat...but when i looked at it i didn't want it. i don't want anything today either. I keep thinking about my little brother lemuel eric and how he died. i keep thinking about how good it would be to see him and tell him I've missed him. I've been thinking alot about the book i've been reading for my research paper. how glorious it would be to be a martyr. to profess there are none like the master of nazareth and to die getting a crown upon my head in heaven...why must i linger among the shadows of the wanderers..."

I love timothy but i don't ever see him and he just doesn't understand me at all. i hate my freaking life. i just want to be six feet under right now. good bye to the world. and the people of the tower. oi, oi, oi, oi."

Mrs. Simmons lied again and we aren't even going to get to watch a movie now because everyone voted for a drop grade. well she didn't even fucking give me a drop grade. she said none of my test scores were low enough so my average would be ok. what the fuck is that? i mean how is it fucking fair to give a bunch of people who failed like half the damn tests a drop grade and not me one because i haven't failed any? stupid bitch. i really can't stand her. lets see everyone in my damn government class needs to get a grip and act like they aren't a bunch of godless celtics.

Last night after work I went and got 3 more piercings. It was really cool. I asked the girl who was doing it if it would be better to wait a few weeks or to get them all at once. She said, ""what the hell, get it done now it'll probably be cheaper."" I was like ok. so I have 3 in one ear and two in the other. uneven yes. but I think it looks pretty cool. I got barbells and they look really awesome. It didn't really hurt at all. I knew it wouldn't though. I had already gotten 4 piercings before this but I let the top two grow back in. I knew what to expect. lol! Except the one next to my cartilage is a little sore. I think me and Jennifer are going to hang out today if she wants to. I don't know if Anna is still sick or what. I have to work all next weekend again. But ya know what? Its gonna be ok because after church today I'm going to apply for like 4 jobs. hahahahah! I love being a bitch sometimes. lol! Well check you guys out later. i gotta work from 5-close tonight so I'll be home around 9:30 or so. By the way I got yahoo instant messenger. If any of you would like to talk to me that way as I said I'll be home around 9:30. Love ya!

#2 Why did my ex-boyfriend send me a picture of his...um whoops-a-daisy? My God Cada thats f*#king sick!

"event","Ok Ok listen. Since we got out of school today due to the weather I decided to post my poem I let a few of you read. Its based on a dream I had about a girl who fell into a grave and ended up in like this entire dimension of lost souls and whatnot. Its not finished yet this is all I've had time to revise. So here it goes...

""The Dimension of Darkness""

Shadows of the darkness
Forever writhe in pain

And lost the captured souls
that they sought to gain

In the hollowness of hatred
lingers ever more

Hellish fathom spectors
that death had never bore

Eyes of glowing madness
that crave the living soul

Of a displaced maiden
damned into the hole

How did it come one dreaded day
this maiden found the road

And lost her spirit in the land
where death has been forbode

Living and breathing is worse than death
as darkness rules the restless nation

But live she must since it was she
that recited the incantation

She cannot cease from running
as the spectors grin and stare

Among the maze of brick and wall
with apparitions lurking there

Alas! Among the shadows
Lady cherubim holds a light

Rejuvinating broken souls
as her aurora burns so bright

She said, ""Little maid lost in the 
blackness of the devil's land

Drink from the goblet of our Christ 
that I hold in my hand""

The maid did so then thanked the angel
and walked back to the maze
 
She quickly stopped seeing then
she'd caught a spector's gaze

It called to her, ""living maid from far
above why dost thou dwindle here?

In the land of endless dark
that mortal men all fear?""

She answered, ""I fell into a tomb
and saw markings in the grave

i read the warnings to myself and
was drawn deeper in the cave""

It said to her,"" Little maid thou spirt is lost
and thou unspent soul is craved

I hope that thou can make the journey
I hope that thou art saved...""

Well what do you think so far? Too confusing? Too dark? That last part was a conversation between a ghost and the girl. He basically told her since she read the writing aloud (it was an incantation) all the spirits in the dimension were after her soul now. lol! crazy huh?"

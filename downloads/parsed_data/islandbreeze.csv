"event","ok, so i'm the least jealous person i know... i have total faith in the people i associate with and always assume that they are being honest with me... so, why is it that i'm a total jealous wreck tonight... why does it bother me that she had a friend over to watch tv? why does it bother me that she slept on the couch? maybe it's the moon... maybe i just need to get some sleep... maybe it's because i really like her... maybe i shouldn't worry about it, but i am... ugh! i hate this feeling... i haven't really got a reason to worry... it hasn't been that long... and it's not like i'm not going to see her friday... it's not like she hasn't sent me a card and flowers ((albeit 'virtual'))... she also says she 'picked something up for me' the other day... i like surprises... i really do... and i can't wait to see what the surprise consists of... ugh... i think i just need a hug tonight and some sleep... yeah, thats it, lots of sleep... 
i think i need to not stress over it... i don't think its ever felt so good just to hear someone's voice... it's the nicest thing ever to have someone call and ask how my day was and really truly want to know... and then tell me about their day knowing that i really want to know... the stories aren't bad either... ok... southpark time..."

"event","<big><b>this is sooo true... freaky man!!!</big></b>

<b>ANDROGYNE</b>
Your score placed you in the category of Androgyne. This is the true middle of the road, neither butch nor femme. You may also wish to review Soft Androgyne and Hard Androgyne, the two categories surrounding you. In a ranking across the femme/butch gamut, if 1 is femme and 100 is butch, you fall between 48 and 52 on the scale. For a review of where you fall in the overall population in numbers, refer to this chart. Your group encompasses folks of all types, genders, and orientations, though is not as large a part of the population as the hard and soft androgynes surrounding you. 


You are the best of both worlds, and have absolutely no feeling of being either femme or butch. You see yourself as ""you"" and that's all that matters. You dislike labels, surprised yourself by even taking this test, and are now laughing as you identify with this definition! 

You switch roles fluidly without thinking from nurturing/subordinate to providing/leading as the situation demands. You are often a jack or jill of all trades and master of a few, but not all. 

In clothing you go for the practical, not always bothering with the concept of neatness if that interferes with comfort or the time it takes to get dressed. Wrinkles don't drive you crazy, though you do prefer to keep reasonably up to date in your style, without going to any extreme in it. 

You are shy in many ways, being intimidated by overt aggression as well as complete silence in a conversation. You tend to babble to fill silent space and clam up when confronted. 

Odds are good astrologically that you are a Libra, Pisces, Gemini, or Aquarius. 

You're willing to try anything once as long as it does not pose a risk to you. You're also good at doing just about any job, as long as you find a way to get trained for it. Physically, you're average in fitness, not being overly concerned about being either ""curvy"" or ""chisled"". If you are female and have some endowments, you wear a bra in public but not at home. 

For partners you are comfortable with all types, for you are a peacemaker and changeling at heart, changing yourself to fit the situation and avoid hostility. You aren't a doormat, though, and do express your opionions."

"event","i think the stress is finally getting to me... maybe it isn't stress... maybe it is a combination of stress and my imagination... i really feel like no one would care if i just dropped off the face of the earth... and more than anything, it just makes me sad... i can't explain it... i'm just sulky... and i don't really know why... i feel like everyone wants me to be on top of things and cover their asses and be there for them and want <i> some </i> things from me but not other things... i know that there are some exceptions to this, but they are few and far between.... bah!"

"event","ok... there are just a couple things that bug me to no end... 

THEN ((correct usage)) - i'm going to the old port, THEN i have class.

THAN ((correct usage)) - i would rather go home than stay on campus. 

((note the difference in meaning of these two words... other words that have different meanings are your and you're, they're and their... it just pains me that people in college don't know the right ways to use these words... ok... no more ranting))

ok... so oddity of oddities... i'm wearing a skirt today... haven't done that in probably two years... i feel like a fish out of water... o well, at least it is a nice day out...

I'd just like to say that the construction outside the towers needs to stop soon... i didn't have to get up till 9:30 this morning but the construction started at 7:30... therefore i was up at 7:30... argh! so, now i'm tired and stressed about this week... 
i should work on that paper i put off last night... i had better things to do last night that write a paper... but now it's due and still not done... o well... thats the story of my life..."

"event","so... family vacations somehow are always cool... even when we fight the whole time we are gone... so anyway, went to Washington DC with my parents and brother... left on friday... got to DC that afternoon and checked into this place my mom had found on the internet... what a fuckin dump... holy shit! anyway, we wandered around till we found a sheraton and reserved a room for the whole vacation... the guy at the roach motel was pissed that we dropped our stuff there for two hours and then took off... i mean really... that place was BEYOND discription... it was that bad... 
so, in the 3 and a half days that we were in DC, we saw the national air and space museum, the museum of american history (the best ever... a whole room full of pop art), museum of natural history (dinosaurs baby), the Washinton momument, the lincoln memorial, the Korean and Vietnam Memorials, the Hershhorn art gallery ((sooo cool)), the National Gallery of art, the US botanical gardens ((thats for you, andy)), the National/Hershhorn Sculpture gardens, the Freer Gallery ((boring)), Ford's theatre ((bang!))... 
other than that, the capital building and the FBI were all closed to the public... it would have taken an act of congress to get thru security with any sort of weapon on you... it was odd having to go thru more security to see some damn planes hanging from the rafters than to get on a plane... anyway, ask me questions, and i will tell you!!"

"event","i wrote something in my paper journal today that really sums up how i felt when i woke up this morning... 

i feel weak. like pit-of-my-stomach weak... everytime i see someone i know, that pit gets deeper... like somehow these 'friends' of mine are taking something from me just by looking... hollowing me out... looking at me for some divinely inspired answer to some question they've been asking for ages... this weak feeling extends through my whole body... my arms are heavy... my feet leaden... my brain is foggy and my pen slow on the page... i'm not used being held captive to the million and one emotions swelling inside me... i feel the need to cry, but can't... the tears just won't come... 

***

but i think i'm ok now... i can sing again... i can't sing when i'm feeling weak like that... my voice doesn't seem like part of me... there's something about the emotions in music that just doesn't sit well with me when i'm not feeling strong... but, i cranked up the tunes tonight and let it out... i have always had a good voice and hearing it reminds me that, because it is so strong, that i am too... and that things are ok... and that, even though the thoughts and emotions in the songs aren't mine, they are thoughts and emotions, and that is enough..."

"event","so, i did the reading for class today... and i think i learned something from it... i have a God-y side to me, and if you didn't know that, then you do now... these quotes just make me understand the power of prayer and the fact that He has control of my life and that it is important for me to let Him do His thing and know that it will be ok... anyway, here are the quotes:

""then i did what i have done since childhood
when i was saddened: i prayed.
i bowed to my Love and spoke:
O Lord: now i am saddened.""

*** 

""then i spoke to our Lord: what do You want with this suffering? And our dear Lord said thus: all your paths are measured, all your footsteps counted, your life is blessed, your end will be happy..."" 

anyway, welcome to the real me... something about those two quotes make me feel quiet in a way that i don't usually feel quiet... none of this points to me being a ""religious"" person... <b>i just believe...</b> i think partly because i don't have the answers to anything in my life right now and it's easier to believe that someone else is at the helm... anyway... thats my story..."

"event","<b><marquee> ahhh! poetry written in class... the best kind... read and enjoy!</marquee></b>

you knew through simple observation
more about me than I did
you wouldn't let on
content to let me stumble, left footed
toward tentative understanding
Suddenly finding steady footing
on unfamiliar ground.
looking for support and understanding
i reached out
only to find you there
still content to watch me
like today's foal
testing new legs. 

***

there are so many things about me
that you will never know
because you didn't stop to find out 
Why? When? How?
you would rather be with she
who is safe and familiar
instead of taking a chance on
someone who, without you knowing
already loves you and knows
how to answer
Who? When? How?

*** 

Something about you
awakened something in me
then something about you
scared me half to death
Now, you call and stop by
calling me friend and equal
It seems time for another kind
of awakening.

***

No matter when we interact
somehow I always walk away feeling 
like a child
just discovering the newfound freedoms, feelings, emotions
of adolecence.
i just can't get past 
that feeling of being 
babyish, unschooled, green, illiterate
in your company.
yet, with all that you know
and as much as I think you would like to
you cannot or will not
teach."

"event","So I got the dress today. I'll be getting it around the beginning of October. It is absolutely stunning. I'd post details except I want it to be a surprise for the most part and I REALLY want to surprise Tim. And it seem like good news just keeps coming. Ashley is doing good! She had another surgery this morning but shes doing good, she is such a fighter. I'm so proud of her. So between moving and the dress and all the other excitement... Well, lets just say it'll be a wonder if I sleep much in the next couple nights."

<u>The Dream</u>
Every time it starts the same,
Almost with the same terrain.
I stand there on the ground
Can't help but look around
To see my sisters play
On a bright sunny day.
I try to run
Share their fun,
But that's when it starts to come undone.
I climb the latter
And here their chatter
As they cross the bridge.
<i>The unheard of, rickety, crickety old bridge.
My heart beats faster,
My breath grows shorter,
I grow weaker,
Time grows longer.</i>
And when I reach that ledge,
Following my sisters on the bridge
I start to fall.
Fall forever.
Fall with speed.
Fall to nowhere.
Until I scream!
And see it's over."

"event","I know this is rough, but it came to me the other night.




I've tried my best 
To find those words 
That could express
What you mean to me

I've turned my world all around,
Shaking it up and down
To see if the words fall out
That say all I want to say
Of what you mean to me

To say I love you
Doesn't really say it
To know I miss you
Only makes it worse
To feel your touch
Makes me burn for more

I search my world harder
Searching for the words
I stumble across a memory
A memory of just us two

I remember the night
The night I knew it was true
As the music played
For just us two

I knew my life had changed
I knew I'd never be the same

You leaned on me
Just before you feel asleep
I whispered in your ear
I breathed in deep

I knew my life had changed
I knew I'd never be the same

I've tried my best
To mold my words
To make them tell you
What you mean to me

Now, I sit here 
Trying to explain
It hurts 
When I can't be there
I cry 
When you're away
I'm sad
When I can't see you
I die 
When you're in pain

I've tried my best
You know I have
You've been there 
Thick and thin

If only I could 
Find those words
That truly express
What you mean to me."

"event","But I have to let the few people who may possibly read this know what has happened.

As of Friday January 6th Tim and I are engaged.

He made me this wonderful 4 course dinner (yummy salad, mouth watering bread sticks, wonderful pizza and to top it all off... pumpkin pie) and when he came out with my slice of pumpkin pie he had the ring on the plate and got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I cried like you don't understand, and of course I said yes. 

We spent all of yesterday on the road going to tell my parents (well really just seeing them, Tim asked Dad for permission and then Dad told Becky and Mom. So really we just stopped to see them and call debbie and tell my grandparents). Then we were off to see his parents. His dad knew about it but his mom didn't have a clue and freaked out. We went out to a wonderful dinner and then 3 hours all the way back to Dubuque.


No dates have been set yet. 

Tim and I are waiting to hear from UW-Platteville. We would like to see if it's possible for me to transfer and not get held back much (if any) more. I'm hoping I can because Platteville is 15 minutes from Dubuque and well I have a 45 to Whitewater. And as Tim said, the most important thing is school. Our wedding can wait a little while if we need it to, no point in getting married and then not being able to see each other more than weekends."

"event","Chapter VIII

Highest good is like water. Because water excels in benifiting the myriad creatures without contending wiht them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way.
   In a home it is the site that matters;
   In quality of mind it is depth that matters;
   In an ally it is benevolence that matters;
   In speech it is good faith that matters;
   In government it is order that matters;
   In affairs it is ability that matters;
   In action it is timeliness that matters.
It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault. 


Chapter XXXVII

The way never acts yet nothing is left undone.
Should lords and princes be able to hold fast to it,
The myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord.
After they are trasnformed, should desire raise its head,
I shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block.
The nameless uncarved block
Is but freedom from desire,
And if I cease to desire and remain still,
The empire will be at peace of its own accord.


Chapter XL

Turning back is how the way moves;
Weakness is the means the way employs.
The myriad creatures in the world are born from Something, and Something from Nothing."

"event","So I survived my sisters wedding, although it feels like a big blur now. 
I mean between flying down there at the ass crack of dawn (which ment only seeing my Timby for a little while) and then finally getting there only to have to wait around for debbies flight 2 hours later (which was late) and then having to sit in the car for another 2 hours to get to the hotel (oye). And that was just the beginning. Then Becky starts asking me to try to get the family going as quickly as I can so we dont have to walk a half a mile for parking. Well of  course we didn't get going when she had hoped, and of course there was the big debate about breakfast which we ended up just munching for. In the car i hear nothing but complaining about how horrible this is and absurd it is that becky is having us do this for her wedding, dressing up and etc, to which i wanted to say ""hey, if this was a wedding by our standards of traditional, making people do stuff they may not be comfortable wtih we wouldnt think a second thought because its tradition, shes choosing a diffrent path, we should respect that"" but i didnt really feel like picking a fight which debbie would have seen that as me picking a fight. But anyways, it was a fun day. I can't say its something I'd do very often, I'd probably do it more if I didnt have to dress up in period clothes and address people as ""my lady"" and what not. But the shopping was fun, and I sat and talked to a lady whos sister did glass etching which was way cool and she, herself, did jewerly making and they were just wonderfully tallented and just very wonderful people. I got Tim a glass that had a classic English scrollish thing on it from them and was very tempted to get a few other things. I think that's the only reason why I'd really want to go back, I mean watching the fights and stuff was ok and all but the fun little shops were the best, and to get that I could just go to a craft fare. There was one guy who I got a knife/mini sword and a silk umbrella from who was a POW from WWII and just a very interesting guy to talk to. I was a little upset that Debbie and Mom just took Raven for the day and didn't let me spend much time with her, but I did have a little time holding her durring the wedding. Which btw was very interesting, I can't exactly put it all into words but it was very beautiful (and so was Becky's dress, oh my god i dont remember the last time i saw her so dolled up and soo beautiful) But it was a very nice wedding and Alen gave my parents some gifts of very expensive, very rare books. After that we saw the court thing and then was mostly tired and didnt really want to stick around cause of the rain so Becky temporarly came with Dad, Debbie, Mom, Mary, Joel, Renee and I to get Raven settled into the hotel room with us and I have to admit i was a little cranky to have that many people in a room bairly bigger than my bed room when i was so sweaty and tired.  But anyways, thats not the best part of the night. This is the most interesting part of the night... i suppose ""best"" is not the word to be using:

So Raven is settled in for a little while and Dad, Debbie, Mom and I are all kinda settling in and resting our feet, being able to spread out for the first time in a while since everyone else left when theres a knock on the door. Alen came over asking for Dad's tools because becky and temporarly put her real wedding ring on her right hand with a ring she's been wearing for a while because her wedding was also a wedding for their personas in the SCA (if that didnt make sence, let me know i'll try to explaine it the best that i can). Ne whos so these two rings are cutting off the circulation to her finger on her right hand and Alen and Dad are trying everythign they can to break this ring and they bairly scratched it. So finally we call 911 to see if they can help and they get all the way out there only to find out they dont have a ring cutter, so we're just about to pile a bunch of people into a car to take Becky to the hospital hoping they would have a ring cutter but just then the fire department calls saying that they found a ring cutter and are on their way. So they get there and after a few minutes of sawing with this cutter the ring is finally off and they cut the other ring off and Beckys hand is returning back to normal. Now heres the kicker, earlier when Becky was showing Alen the ring asking if this was an ok ring for a wedding ring he starts laughing and says ""sure, if thats the one you really like, then thats the one u can have"" and after a little while becky finally gets him to tell her that the ring was worn by German Women who COULDN'T find a husband, which figures that would be the ring Becky would pick out. So later, when the rings are off and shes comfortable, we all have a little laugh about that and the night continues. 

The next day (sunday) wasnt very eventful, we packed into the car, said our good byes (which i think i'm the only one who really wanted to say good bye to Alen but i'll get into this later) and drop debbie off at the airport and then head on our drive straight back to madison. Finally getting home and not wanting to move once getting here. Now with debbie in the car and with out we had the same conversation twice. Debbie and Mom don't like Alen, Dad and I arnt totally thrilled with him but hey, whatever, he makes becky happy and its her choice, we should support that. Now Debbie and Mom just start complaining about beckys choice saying she coulda done better and blah blah blah and i'm 3 seconds away from saying durring both conversations ""dude, it doesnt matter, hes family now, he deserves to be treated like family, if for no other reason because Becky deams him worthy of it"" but again, i didnt really feel like picking a fight and mom and debbie would have seen it as me picking a fight so i kept my mouth shut. Which the aquard scilence was covered up soon with mom chiming in saying ""but i do approve of Tim, hes a very good guy."" so i'm figuring i now have my mom and dads blessing on marring Tim when that comes around to being an appropreate time. 

Now i'm sitting here missing my Timby cause its been a long weekend and i didnt get my fill of Timby time and i'm drinking the worlds weirdest beer, i cant even begin to describe it, tim says it tastes like bananas but i dont taste that, i dont know what i taste. and i'm watching the news on Katrina slowly trying to see if i can find any information about my old Online friend Emile (or better known by his Middle name, Simon) to find out if he's ok or what. Last I heard he was in New Orleans, but who knows.

As of now... nothing."

"event","for once.... this is pretty damn rare.... Tim is asleep before i am. although he should be. he has to work in dubuque tomorrow and has had the tendency to get to sleep around 5 or 6, thankfully he took an ambien and has been out for about a half hour now. I hope he sleeps well, he needs it, especially with everything he has going on and how busy his mind has been lately. I'm afraid we are two of the same. We both worry too much, although i'm mostly worring about him right now. but i have to look at the bring side so i can stop worring a little. he's asleep, which means he's relaxed, which is probably a first in a long time. I hope all is well for everyone out there in internetland. I know i havent exactly been around or able to talk or posting. My car finally clunked out. well mostly, we were able to get some poor soul to buy it for 300 and i now have a chevy blazer which i have yet to name. mable was a good car. she took me through 20,000 or 30,000 miles or so, i dont remember how ""young"" she was when i got her but she had 161000 on her when i passed her on. 

options for car names: (and meanings)
beverly (meadow of beavers)
Edlyn (noble woman)
Perri (wanderer)


any other ideas? i'm kinda tired i should get some sleep."

With it's brutal nesting habits
And it's pointless savagery

And raises up the ante

And the other down your panties

You torment the birds and the bees
You leapt into the abyss, but find
It only goes up to your knees
I move stealthily from tree to tree
I shadow you for hours
I make like I'm a little deer
Grazing on the flowers

Everything is collapsing, dear
All moral sense has gone
It's just history repeating itself
And babe, you turn me on

We stand awed inside a clearing
We do not make a sound
The crimson snow falls all about
Carpeting the ground

I'm sorry that things are not well
I'm sorry you are confused
You looked nice and ripe
Aparently you're green
Please 
Do not hate me
I mean not to scorn you 
I'm just trying to help 
After all
I did have fun 
Picking you from the bunch
You seamed so sweet
Sweeter than the rest
I'm sorry 
We must part our ways
I do not want to eat you 
Not today
You do not mix
Not with my other Mangos
It is my unfortunate
Pleasure
To Inform you
That your cutting remarks are
Too much like acid
And That
Your sour is much too
Bitter for my taste
I have no recipe for you
So out Sour Mango!
Out! 
I shall not mourn 
Your passage through 
My life
Nor shall I mourn
Your passage through
The garbage disposal

Sincerly,

[23:54] ShortChippy: hi
[23:54] titiania: hi
[23:54] ShortChippy: i'm back
[23:54] ShortChippy: i won 6
[23:54] titiania: cool
[23:54] ShortChippy: andy lost 10 :(
[23:55] titiania: aw
[23:55] ShortChippy: cristina won 14
[23:56] titiania: fun
[23:56] ShortChippy: yeah...we both felt bad...this was andy's first time
[23:56] titiania: aww
[23:57] ShortChippy: andy and i are gonna go to the Ho this summer
[23:57] titiania: cool
[23:58] ShortChippy: yea...for wisconsin people
[00:09] ShortChippy: i wish he liked me
[00:10] ShortChippy: he had fun besides losing 10
[00:11] titiania: thats good
[00:11] ShortChippy: yep
[00:15] ShortChippy: :-\
[00:15] titiania: ?
[00:15] ShortChippy: nevermind....you don't like me talking about it
[00:17] titiania: no what is it?
[00:18] ShortChippy: i really like andy, and i wish there was something i could do to change his mind about me...but i know there isn't cause most guys don't like me, and the ones that do have girlfriends or mega issues
[00:19] titiania: well that just goes to show ya havent found someone good yet.
[00:19] titiania: i know it sucks, but sometimes thats just how things gotta be for a little while, then something good comes along
[00:20] ShortChippy: easy for you to say
[00:21] titiania: yea, but dont forget that it wasnt too long ago i was saying the exact same thing
[00:21] ShortChippy: yeah, and it has been thrown in my face so many times, that you have someone and i am without.
[00:22] titiania: i'm sorry i'm not trying to do that
[00:22] titiania: thats not my intents at all
[00:22] ShortChippy: kk does it all the time too
[00:22] titiania: well i'm sure they dont mean to do it either, but thats just kinda how they are
[00:23] ShortChippy: yeah and that is why i can't stand hanging out with them, they make me feel like shit
[00:23] titiania: well ok, i wont ask you to hang out with them again, especally kimberly
[00:24] ShortChippy: kyle is the hypocrite
[00:24] titiania: yea, but we all can be
[00:26] ShortChippy: i have issues with people who can be unfaithful so easily... ex. kyle, and andrew
[00:26] titiania: yea
[00:26] titiania: understandable
[00:26] titiania: but thats something thats their problem, and only yours if you make it to be
[00:26] ShortChippy: ok i understand the JD david thing
[00:27] ShortChippy: well with andrew it was, cause well he put moves on me
[00:27] ShortChippy: and kyle comments to me
[00:28] titiania: comments can be stopped, you can always say ""hey i'm uncomfortable with you saying that please stop"" and andrew you could have stopped too
[00:28] ShortChippy: i was sick, i wasn't thinking, i had a 102 temp
[00:29] titiania: ok, well then if you wernt feeling that good and thinking straight then should u have hung out with him in the first place? i'm not trying to be a bitch or make this all your fault i'm just trying to say that everyone has a part in it ya know? and its only you're problem if you want it to be
[00:30] ShortChippy: it isn't my biggest problem right now anyways
[00:30] ShortChippy: i got other shit on my mind
[00:30] titiania: ok well what is?
[00:30] ShortChippy: don't worry about it
[00:31] titiania: no tell me come on i wanna help
[00:31] ShortChippy: it won't help
[00:31] titiania: alright fine
[00:32] ShortChippy: i've tried before and i hit a brick wall
[00:33] titiania: well i dont know what to tell ya hon
[00:34] ShortChippy: excuses are made, people pretend, people ignore....pretty much what it comes down to
[00:35] titiania: i'm sorry if i've done something to piss you off but i'm not exactly sure what i've done wrong
[00:38] ShortChippy: there is a reason i just gave up
[00:38] titiania: i'm sorry
[00:41] ShortChippy: cause i tried before, and i wasn't understood, and things got ignored...and i just gave up
[00:41] ShortChippy: and you don't need me bringing you down
[00:41] ShortChippy: so i might as well not even bother
[00:43] titiania: well i'm sorry, i guess theres nothing more i can do but be sorry. i'm sorry i didnt understand i'm sorry i ignored things i'm sorry
[00:44] ShortChippy: no offense, but sorry is mundane to me
[00:45] titiania: well i dont know what to do
[00:45] ShortChippy: why bother
[00:47] titiania: well let me know what i can do, i'm here you know where to find me just let me know
[00:47] *** Auto-response from ShortChippy: changing my infusion set
[00:55] ShortChippy: how can a person do something when they don't even realize that shit has happened, and even when it was pointed out, that it got ignored and brushed off
[00:56] titiania: well i'm sorry, i didnt realise you felt like i was doing that, i certianly didnt mean to
[00:59] ShortChippy: i had a long conversation with you about it, and then it got ignored, that is why i have given up, it isn't even worth it anymore, even if it has been upseting me, my mom told me to blow it off, dina told me there isn't much i can do
[01:05] titiania: I'm sorry if you feel that i have somehow lessened your possition in my life i'm really sorry if you feel like i'm ignoring you or blowing you off but you have to understand that i have alot going on in my life right now perticularly with becky and raven and school and etc, and i know you have alot going on too. and i understand what you're going though isnt exactly easy but i need to figure some things out. Its not that i dont care i do. i'm just stuck and i'm not sure what to do anymore. yes i'm spending time with tim. but i dont mean for it to be cutting back on your time. i'm sorry if me going outta town durring your last weekend in town hurt you but i needed to get away from this house for a little while
[01:06] ShortChippy: this is why i don't even want to talk to you about how i feel, cause you come back with something that makes me feel like shit and be littled
[01:07] titiania: i dont mean to make you feel be littled but i'm trying to make you understand that i have things going on too, i'll try to help you out as much as i can but i'm only human i can only take so much
[01:07] ShortChippy: i haven't wanted to bring it up cause i know you are having a rough time because of becky, but i can't keep lying to you that i am ok with things, when i am not
[01:08] titiania: well what arent you ok with? what is it that i'm doing wrong
[01:12] ShortChippy: i wouldn't say you are doing something wrong, versus i feel i have become insignificant, that you don't want me around, i feel like your life has too much in it that i am a hassle to have in it, that it sucks when your best friend tells you, you can't talk about something cause it frustrates them, when the reason you are talking about it is cause you are frustrated yourself. and this has been since florida, but more so now, cause you found a replacement for me. 
[01:13] ShortChippy: i came home more times last semester to hang out with you, and you never seem to want me there...and it seem to get worse over break, that you would rather be somewhere else, and i was an obligation.
[01:17] titiania: its not that i dont want you around, i want you around and i love talking to you and i still love being around you but tim is not a replacement for you and i'm sorry if i occasionally need a break from everything. i dont mean for you to take things personally but i was doing the same thing to kyle, i didnt exactly spend alot of time with him and i still havent been. i'm not sure what else to say but thats the truth. and i'm sorry if you feel like i havent wanted to be around you, i do, but i'm not sure what else to do
[01:18] ShortChippy: don't compare me to kyle
[01:18] titiania: alright well i dont know what to tell you
[01:19] ShortChippy: i didn't expect you to
[01:20] ShortChippy: cause i know you don't realize how much i have been hurting lately
[01:21] titiania: well i'm sorry but i havent exactly been happy go lucky lately either. i've been hurting too. 
[01:21] ShortChippy: yeah, and that is why i didn't want to talk about it, but you pryed
[01:22] titiania: well isnt that what a friend is suppose to do?
[01:22] titiania: a friend is suppose to help you though the bad times and enjoy the good times and listen when you need an ear. thats what i'm trying to do
[01:23] ShortChippy: yeah but a week or so ago, you were telling me you zone me out cause i talk in circles, that you can't stand to listen to it anymore
[01:24] titiania: well i'm sorry if all you were talking about was guys. and theres only so much of the same stories a person can take
[01:24] titiania: and i'm sorry if i encouraged you to talk about guys
[01:24] ShortChippy: YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TIM!!! that is hypocritcal
[01:24] titiania: well i was trying not to
[01:24] ShortChippy: but you did
[01:25] titiania: yea cause you were talking about other guys. its a vicious cycle. its the way we sometimes work
[01:25] titiania: we;ve done it before
[01:26] titiania: i remember we had a conversation before we went to florida about how we always talk about guys and you said its cause i always talk about them and i said its cause u always talk about them nad its just a vicious cycle we end up getting into and i'm sorry that it happens i cant controll it anymore tahn you can
[01:26] ShortChippy: then don't make me feel like shit about it
[01:27] titiania: i dont mean to make you feel like shit, i'm sorry if it does
[01:27] ShortChippy: it is on my mind, i am dealing with it, and honestly i just don't want to talk about the other stuff that worries me and bothers me.
[01:27] titiania: well ok, then dont complaine when i talk about the same subject in my life
[01:28] ShortChippy: last thursday I felt like shit, and then friday you acted like everything was ok...and i can't stand that
[01:28] titiania: well you seamed ok i wasnt sure what was going on so i was trying to mend things
[01:28] ShortChippy: by not saying a damn word
[01:29] ShortChippy: things have just gotten worse
[01:29] titiania: fine its all my fault it'll always be my fault i have to get to sleep because i have a obligation in the morning if you feel like talking to me again fine, but because everything is my fault i'll just keep out 
[01:29] titiania: if nothing else i'll talk to you in a few months when things have cooled down and we can come back at this rationally
[01:29] ShortChippy: SHUT UP!
[01:29] ShortChippy: it is not
[01:30] ShortChippy: what the fuck
[01:30] titiania: what else are you trying to tell me? 
[01:30] titiania: you're telling me that i'm not a good friend and that i dont listen
[01:30] titiania: and i'm sorry
[01:30] ShortChippy: so you are just going to stop talking to me like that
[01:30] ShortChippy: sorry i told you how i feel
[01:30] titiania: i'm not trying to be a bad friend 'm trying to be a good friend. i'm sorry thats how you feel but apparently theres nothing i can do to make it better
[01:31] ShortChippy: you are a good friend....just things lately have been messed up
[01:31] ShortChippy: see i fucked up again...
[01:31] ShortChippy: i did this with jeff, and i am doing it with you
[01:31] ShortChippy: this is why i should keep things bottled up
[01:32] titiania: well ok you did i dont know what i did wrong i dont know where the communation was lost i'm willing to help you but i dont know what i've personally done wrong and i dont see how if you were in my shoes you would have done anything diffrent
[01:32] ShortChippy: I DON'T NEED HELP!
[01:33] ShortChippy: i wasn't asking for help
[01:33] titiania: well obviously you do, if you feel that you're doing the same wrong things to the same people then obvously help is needed
[01:33] ShortChippy: and i was just telling you how i have felt lately, not trying to blame you for anything
[01:33] titiania: well thats how it felt 
[01:33] titiania: and theres nothing i can change about it
[01:33] ShortChippy: fine i am a fucked up person, who needs so much help, that she doesn't deserve friends
[01:34] ShortChippy: cause her best friend just told her she will stop talking to her for months
[01:34] titiania: and i'm sorry if it keeps going like this there nothing i can do. i want to help you though whatever i want to be your friend but i just dont know how anymore
[01:34] ShortChippy: just don't push me away anymore
[01:35] ShortChippy: that is what has been pissing me off
[01:35] ShortChippy: big time
[01:35] ShortChippy: and i don't want help!
[01:35] ShortChippy: i am not a mental case
[01:36] titiania: last time you told me all the things you felt and all the things that went wrong i didnt do anything cause i didnt realise there was anything to change, i explained my bit and i thought that was it. now you come back with the same thing saying nothing changed and you say that nothing needs to change this is just how you feel, i dont understand anymore. 
[01:36] ShortChippy: you don't need me doing this to you
[01:36] titiania: i'm not trying to push you away but having arguments like this really doesnt help matters. 
[01:37] titiania: and actually frankly i dont need you doing this to me. and i know you dont need me doing this too but i'm stuck i dont know what to do.

[01:44] ShortChippy: but it happened...
[01:44] titiania: well i'm sorry but i didnt know about it and if i dont know about it theres nothing i can do
[01:44] ShortChippy: my mom even said something the next day cause she heard what was said
[01:44] ShortChippy: there isn't....
[01:45] titiania: what was said that made you upset?
[01:45] ShortChippy: the whole thing about me dressing nice
[01:45] ShortChippy: i changed like 5 times
[01:45] ShortChippy: trying to look my best
[01:46] titiania: well thats fine, no one said there was anything wrong wtih that
[01:46] ShortChippy: and then to get that i was overdressed hurt 
[01:46] ShortChippy: i got ""that's what you wearing""
[01:46] titiania: well i'm sorry. sometimes i forget that you like to dress up to go out, i dont always dress up to go out
[01:47] ShortChippy: i know, and i didn't expect you to, but the comments made me feel bad
[01:47] ShortChippy: and the whole popcorn thing about me going to get it so i could meet someone really set me off
[01:49] titiania: you know, i'm sorry if the details of our past hurts you and i'd love to sit here and argue through them with you but i have to teach in a few hours and i'd like to be awake and somehwat reaxed. i'm sorry if things got said that hurt you but you're hurting me right now, i dont know what to do to make things better you keep me thinking that i either did something wrong or that i'm accusing you and i'm not. you tell me i'm a bad friend and then take it back, you've 
[01:50] titiania: tried to blame your problems on me and i cant deal with that anymore
[01:50] titiania: 'm not sure what to do i'm not sure what you want of me so tell me what is it
[01:50] titiania: my heads spinning i cant take it anymore
[01:50] ShortChippy: you are a good friend
[01:50] titiania: and i dont wanna push you away but if thats how i can get all this to stop so help me i will. as much as it kills me you'll leave me no choice
[01:50] ShortChippy: i just felt pushed away
[01:51] ShortChippy: and i may not use the right words
[01:51] ShortChippy: losing you as a friend would destory me
[01:51] ShortChippy: and i am sorry i have felt this way
[01:51] titiania: ok then tell me when i'm not paying enough attention to you tell me right away when things are bugging you and we can solve them when they start instead of letting them build up to the point where we are at now
[01:51] titiania: i need sleep, i'm sorry if i have to cut this short but i need to sleep
[01:52] ShortChippy: ok
[01:52] *** Auto-response sent to ShortChippy: Goodnight, sleep tight 
No more tears 
In the morning I'll be here 
And when we say goodnight, 
Dry your eyes 
Because we said goodnight, 
And not goodbye 
We said goodnight 
And not goodbye
[02:10] titiania: I'm sorry, but lately all you're doing is thinking about yourself, and with my situation apparently i cant be there the way you want me to be and its obvoius that cant work with our friendship so lets both cool off and i'll talk to you in a month or so when maybe we can both be less selfish and see eachothers situations better
[02:10] *** Auto-response from ShortChippy: so i messed up with a person who means more to me than i could ever tell her. because i had to go let myself think about me for once. and i hurt a person i care about. i'm going to try and sleep so i don't get sick."

Only you do it a lot of times and the result can be more boxes if you're not careful, or worse yet, tab A gets something from slot B and falls off. Or slot B gets something from tab A and then you have to smear goopy cream all over slot B, during which time inserting tab A into slot B is just not going to happen, what kind of slot do you think B is anyways? Meanwhile, tab A is busily being inserted into slot C or D, without even so much as a phone call the day after. And tab M just looks on just wishing it could be tab A, because nice tabs never get any slots. And then there's tab F who actually likes tab R, but isn't sure if tab R folds that way. Slot C eventually finds out about slot D and they all find out about slot B, who in turn finds out about slot C and D and in a vengeful plot, tears tab A from its box in a fit of passion. Slot C ends up meeting tab M, and it turns out tab M fits perfectly into slot C--no jostling or forceful cramming at all. Tab and slot C are joined forever by tab K, who has sworn not to insert itself into anything and a few months later, there are new tabs and slots and everyone, except for A, is happy.

"event","Like today, one of them comes by asking if she can use the phone for a second cause she has to call in sick from work. Well, first she makes the phone call, then gives me the half hour explination of what happened to make her need to use the phone, THEN she goes into all sorts of topics from cats to pregnancy to working to school to politics to God knows what else cause I started to zone out 2 hours later I realise we're talking about breast feeding kids and I know I should have been insulted because she said ""well .. yea ... she was a big girl like you..."" now come on you've been yacking off my ear for the past 2 hours I nicely let ya use our phone and now you insult me! Good God woman! but at that point I was just too annoyed that I just let it slide. Still bothers me, I mean I know I'm over weight, I know theres a little extra baggage that could get lost. But man she made it sound like I was huge! Grrrs

Ok well anyways I'm back to working on the month log project that should have taken an hour to begin wtih but for ungodly reasons is taking SOOO much longer..."

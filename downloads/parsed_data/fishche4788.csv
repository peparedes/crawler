"event","Hey!!! well it has been a while since i have updated so ill pick up where i left off. On friday i went to the football game and frankly it sucked. Most of my friends are in the band and the other friends who arnt were all fighting or with their new boyfriend. the only good part was wen the band went on break and i chilled with all my best buds (especially jess and britt). I never went to the dance cuz i was wicked tired and i hate most dances anywayz. On saturday i had practice and then we had a BBQ at the pool which sucked at first cuz there was like no food left but then billy had his father (who owns patriot pizza) bring us four pizzas. so that was awesome!! then i came home took a shower and then it was off to the American Idol concert with the fam and my aunt and two little cousins. It was ok but the best part was seeing Jasmine Trias on stage in person. she is so HOT!! she looks even better in person then on tv!! so then i come home and go online for a second and meg im's me and we talk for like 4 hours about tons of shit that needed to be discussed. i definitly think that we needed to have that convo. On sunday all i did was go to swimming a.k.a HELL for 4 hours and get the shit beat out of me. then i came home ate a shit load of food, took a nap and did homework. well thats all for now!!

"event","hello everyone!! Lets see here from the last time i updated i have done some cool things. On saturday i went to practice and got the shit beat out of me and then i had to go to stupid ass work. work definitly sucked cuz i had to vaccum the pool and do tons of shit which SUCKED. so then these two girls that live where i work are like wanna go to the movies and i was like uh no and then they were like dom is goin so im like o ok ill go. so dom picks us up and we go see Anacondas which was good and then we brought them all home and that was saturday. On sunday i went to the Deustche Bank Golf Tournament which was awesome!!! I was almost hit by John Daly's golf ball cuz my dad was like COLE and was like wow there is a ball shit! its coming rite toward me Ahhhhhhh!!! it was funny and i was on TV!!! i also saw tiger woods and was like 2 feet away from him. and today i went to fox woods with the family. My parents gambled while me and jill walked around and hung out in a 2 floor arcade and won a shit load of tickets but the prizes sucked so we gave them to a little kid. he was like wicked happy he was acting like we just gave him a million dollars. so thats it. o and at fox woods we ate at this huge food court which had like every type of food imaginable for only 13 dollars at the door and then you could eat all you want.

"event","hey everyone!!! i have had a very fun day today!! i will start off when i woke up and went to work. I was dreading it but my favorite person in the whole world DOM came early and we talked about arizona and all that. then i left at 3 and went to the pool to swim and i thought someone was gonna be there but no one came so i swam alone but after i swam i talked with hannah for a while which was fun. then i went back to ridgewood to meet dom and casey was there so us 3 waited for danielle to come and pick us up so she came and we went to the band show thing. we didnt stay very long but at least i got to see some of it! me, danielle, dom and casey drove around for a while and went to a cemetary and drove around some more. it was fun. then they dropped me off and here i am now. im goin to bed soon cuz i have to go back to work tomorrow morning.

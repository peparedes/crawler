"event","Wherefore doest the river flow?  Why must it take me with it?  Today I cleaned out my toe jam with my fingernails.  And then, without washing my hands, I ate 2 PB&J sandwiches.  I like PB&J.  They are yummy!  Anyway, Coach Price rocks, because he cathces me skipping everytime I do it.  And I do it so much.  Sorry mom!  Whitney looked so beautiful today.  Her makeup was perfect.  She does a good job with it.  Ryan smelled like fesces wrapped in burnt hair today.  I have a crush on Steven Bennett.  I don't think he knows, but maybe he will figure it out someday.
I burnt myself today lighting my cigarette.  And then I lost my keys.  AGAIN!!!  I had put them on top of my car last night when I was getting out of the car.  This morning, they weren't there.  That sucks.  Oh well, mommy will have to buy me another copy.  I sure do love my 88 Honda civic.  But the keys are hard to keep up with.
So what's going on in your world?  I hate boys (except Steven).  The girls at my school are sooooooo mean.  They are 2-faced punks.  But then again, so am I. JK  I'm perfect!!!  Especially my face.  People don't understand me.  They think I'm conceited.  But I'm not.  I just have opinions.  They just happen to be humble but accurate.
I ran over a squirrel yesterday.  It was as big as a chipmunk.  I freaked out and then reversed the car, and hit my dad's car.  That stunk.  So I put it in forward, and ran over my sister's tricycle.  Rough day huh?
Chapel rocked yesterday.  It only lasted an hour and 15 min.  as opposed to spiritual emphasis week where chapel lasted 5 hours.  Yay!
I had tea spilled on me last night, all over me.  Thanks O'Charley's!  Good times.  Why me????  Why me????  Why does O'Charley hate me???  Oh well.
Cliff is a sexy beast, but Colby is ugly!  Wait, they are twins.  Oh well, life is confusing.
Well, I'm off to lunch.  Love you guys!  Muah!!!
Haley

P.S.  fesces means poop.
P.S.S.  I weigh 84 lbs.  do I look fat?
P.S.S.S.  Soccer won yesterday, they are so good, I can't hit a ball with a bat like that, life stinks..."

When I saw Whitney this morning I felt better becuz my gosh Whit it's called SHOWER!! j/k In Algebra we did a whole lot of NOTHING as usual..and at Lunch Colby and Cory went and got me some uh Wendys! We got report cards today and I dont have one C...YAY NOT GROUNDED!...
After school Whitney came home with me and we watched Muary and then went to the tanning bed..then my mom said hey go get some Milk and a Dr.Peper..and so we went in Brunos with 5$ and we are gettin all that then my mom calls and says get some cotton balls and I dont hink I have enough money so we get to the cash register and NOPE NOT ENOUGH MONEY! Welp we go back to the car and get more money and go back in then as we are gettin gin the car I slam the Door on the Cotton Balls so they go EVERYWHERE! It was funny...well me and Whit are about to go get some Guthries and come home and eat then I am dropping her off at her house and then I am stopping by Colbys..
    With Love
Hale and Whit"

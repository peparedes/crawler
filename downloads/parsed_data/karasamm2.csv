this isnt about vitaly
this isnt about adam
this is about me moving foreward in my life and becoming who i am to be in this world. i want to fill it with everything in from the coming years. im tired of living in the shadows. im breaking out.

i feel like im back up at state. and i cant sleep. its a good thing that i dont have to be up for anything.
i feel like shit.
<lj-cut text=""current thoughts, u dont have to read, i just need to get this out in front of me""> im having <i>issues</i> at the moment. and i dont know how to get rid of them. i dont want to have to see any less of him, but at the same time i dont see how im gonna get unattatched from him, if we dont. its a sad thing whats happening. im completely miserable when im not with him, i feel like my heart breaks each time... i figured that maybe typing up what im feeling in here might help me a little, so far no good. 

i dont know exactly what im feeling, but i know its not a good feeling...right now is what i mean, not all the time. on wednesday i went to work cause i was feeling down and as soon as i saw him i started bawling, and i dont know why. i just missed him sooo much. and tonight after he left i was soooo crushed. i tried talking to him but neither of us know what to do. neither of us want to spend less time w/ each other. but i need to feel ok when im not with him. im kinda starting to think that this is why ive been so sick lately... cause i always get sick when im not w/ him, except for that one time in the parking lot...

i dont know what to do. i love him sooo much. and i know that he loves me, but its hard. ive never felt like this....like i wanted to just keal over and die when he leaves and just not be awake when im not with him.

i just got physically sick like 10 min ago. i think to much...i know. i just want to be happy, and i am, but i hate being preoccupied with the thought of losing him, and he keeps telling me that its not going to happen. but ive almost lost him, twice...(nov and feb). and my heart was shattered to pieces each time and i was miserable.
<center>::begins to sob...again::</center>
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO...

<center>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</CENTER>

i feel so overwhelmed...what am i going to do tomorrow?? i wont get any homework done just cause i know that i wont. maybe my mom will take me shopping. ill prolly have to drive out to new hudson tho sometime tomorrow... i dont want to go out that way.

"event","<center>You cannot quit me so quickly 
Is no hope in you for me 
No corner you could squeeze me 
But I've got all the time for you love 

The space between 
The tears we cry is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more 
The space between 
The wicked lies we tell to keep us safe from the pain 

Will I hold you again 
These fickle fuddled words confuse me 
Like will it rain today 
We waste the hours with talking talking 
These twisted games we're playing 
We're strange allies with warring hearts 
What a wild eyed beast you be 

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a rollercoaster 
You know you went off like the devil in the church 
In the middle of a crowded room 
All we can do my love 
Is hope we don't take this ship down 
The space between 
Where you smile and hide 
That's where you'll find me if I get to go 
The space between 
The bullets in our fire fight 
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you 
The rain that falls splashed in your heart 
Ran like sadness down the window into your room 
The space between our wicked lies is 
The hope to keep safe from pain 
Take my hand cause we're walking out of here 
Right out of here is all we need dear 
The space between 
What's wrong and right 
Is where you'll find me hiding 
Waiting for you 
The space between 
Your heart and mind 
Is the space we'll fill with time</center>

and like 20 min in getting sexually harrassed by a customer.
adam ""yelled"" at me cause i didnt tell mike about it. but ive never told anyone when shit like that happens. i told adam, and then steve walked in on our conversation...and steve got pretty upset about it, and he didnt even know what really happened. i just dont understand what mike would have done. anyways so i ended up crying at work...

i dont know how im going to survive this semester... i starting <i>thinking</i> last night while watching mad about you. and i just got so upset over my parents and school. i just missed adam like crazy. so for the past like two or three days my mom has been in one of her little moods where she hates only me, and sets out to make my life miserable. and then this morning, i find a note on the counter that says: 
<i>cara,
could you pick up your sister from her post at 3:55
love, mom</i>
and then there is a huge smiley face underneath....shes only nice when she wants something, or when adam is around...im convinced.

i have a bio quiz that i have to take today. im really not sure if i want to take it cause i only went to one of the classes that she lectured on. so i have no idea what we learned. i guess i should make up my mind cause i have to leave soon. hmm....

i cant stand living here anymore. i hate talking to my mom about where im going to school next year cause all we end up doing is fighting over it. who gives a fuck if i dont want to go back to MSU next year. fuck her!

not too much has been going on. ive been seeing adam everyday. yesterday we both had work and then went home and each took naps, at like 730 he came and got me, and we went to best buy where i got a movie and some collectors pack of Mad About You. we also talked to a guy over in the car audio section about the new head unit that i got. after that we went to red robin for ""dinner""/dessert. melissa was working there so she came and sat with us for a little while. and we kinda sorta talked about the place that she found in canton for us. we're going to try and set up an appointment with the guy soon. at like 1030ish we left there and went to meijer to get me a new razor. and then we went back to my house and watched mad about you.

right now im waiting for him to come pick me up. we have to go to gifis cause i left my bracelet there yesterday, and then we're goign to rams horn for lunch, and then probably back here to do biology... or maybe to his his house cause i hate my mom.

"event","had a pretty shitty day (the 17th).
i didnt go to math even tho i shouldve. i should have went and gotten my test. but nope! i didnt. damn me! well i got up for biology and went, took forever to find a parking spot...and i ended up getting one on like the opposite side of the parking lot that i wanted to be in, in the center lot. so i get to biology and i had an okay time in there. i got my test back that i took last week and i got an 80% on it, and i got an 81% on the quiz that i took yesterday. everyone that i saw today really liked my hair tho...so thats a plus...

anyways after biology i went home and got really bored, so i decided that i would go for a little run, cause i havent been running since like the spring when vitaly and i went... anyways so i get all dressed for the weather, it was so damn cold out. annnnyways, so i run up to the elementary school thats in my neighborhood and on the way back (over on meadowlark (i think thats the street)) im running, im running, putting one foot in front of the other...and BOOM! i put my foot down and my whole fucking knee gives out...WHAT THE HELL!? so i walk the rest of the way home in a hell of a lot of pain. i get home and collapse on the bed, and then decide to stop feeling sorry for myself and got my ass out of bed and into the shower. and then back into bed. and then instead of calling into work, i go. and then i get there, and the new girl wont stop staring at me. i was like mmmk... so everything that she says to me is a compliment. and i get kind of suspicious that the managers told her to be nice to me, so i ask adam to ask debbie what was going on, because it was making me kind of uncomfertable (if she was just being nice to me, and just faking it...fuck that) so adam asked debbie and she said that she would never get involved between two of her workers like that, but that jennifer would...(hint hint). so now im pissed and pretty hurt...i guess that what happened is that im ""not the easiest person to get along with"" so to get on my good side shes complimenting me. she complimented me on my hair, my earrings, my necklace, even my work pants...""i really like your pants, where did you get them?"" wth!? and those were the only things that she said to me all day.

i feel like the whole world is against me. i wish it was summer and my friends were back in livonia, i feel so stuck.
hopefully, tomorrow...ill just be drunk, and all this will go away for awhile...


if a lightening bolt struck me down right now i wouldnt be the slightest bit upset, unless i lived."

nothing exciting, just a giant martini...

i love laying in bed after a shower just with a towel wrapped around me, theres something about it thats just really relaxing. and thats exactly what i need right now. just to relax, id go into more details but then i might be <i>running my mouth</i> and some people just really hate that about me.

its time for a change with my body. im sick of the way that it looks. i dont want to gain any weight, cause i did that already and nothing good came from it, so i think that im gonna try to lose weight or turn my fat into muscle. vitaly is on this new whim right now about gaining weight, hes been drinking these protein shakes and hes been working out, and has inspired me to take care of my body, not to necessacerily (sp?) lose weight, but to keep it healthy, and healthy looking. i went out for a run today, and fucked up my knee pretty bad. it totally gave out on me, so i had to walk the rest of the way. damn my knees!

my biology lab went pretty well today we were dealing with beetle larvae and we thought that we killed all of them...but luckily they didnt, they just panicked a lot and went into shock and then froze...lol. the girl that was in my group with anthony and adam and i said that she thought that they put them into bottles of tequilla, i hope not! eeee....

i talked to brienne for like a quick 5 min today over AIM. i miss her soooo much. next time youre in town be sure to call me you crazy girl you! 

so i think that spring break is a no go this year for the 5 of us that went last year. its a shame! i know that i have NO MONEY for anything right now, i think that katy is going to ohio or something (even tho we're supposed to go to arizonia..), i talked to brienne a while back and i dont think that she could go either, i dont remember, and i havent talked to amanda or stephanie in a long time...so much for doing this every year...maybe we should start a new thing and try to go in the summer...since we know that we all have the summer off at the same time... any takers??

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.

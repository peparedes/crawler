"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#cccccc size=4>OK...so this is for corrina! Day _: today was a dull day. school way dumb as always and nothing really big happened. im kinda angry that a good friend is making me make a certain decision that i might not want to make. who is he to think he can tell me what to do?? i think this guy is just trying to get out of something that we were gonna do... although i told him he could. maybe he just feels obligated?? but the truth is i dont want to spend that night hanging out with him... if he is really wanting to be with the girl he really likes?? i event told him i would help him...i dont understand. well this is what has&nbsp;got me aggravated so im gonna go ponder.....bye.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","Sometimes It Be That Way 


Night with its shattered teeth attempts to speak 
My pen is present but courage left via the sink 
And I'm sorry I snuck up on you from behind 
Sorry not all my love letters did rhyme 
And I'm sorry that Jesus died for my sins 
And I swear to God it won't happen again 
And I'm sorry if it was my swerve that tempted you to sway 
Oh well, sometimes it be that way 
And Romeo was a very nice man 
He said, ""Jewel, I don't think you quite understand"" 
And I'm sorry if you had to explain it like this 
Sorry I was a point you were destined to miss 
And I'm sorry I spoke to you irreverently 
Down in the hollow by the old olive tree 
And I'm sorry if my heart breaking ruined your day
Oh well, sometimes it be that way 


CHORUS
I said, ""Oh well, I got nothing left to sell"" 
This love was a bell that rang unheard in the air 
I was bound to find out that you didn't care 
Oh well, sometimes it be that way 


And Aphrodite with her neon lamp 
Kissed Neptune, they put her face on a stamp 
And I'm sorry I used it to mail a letter to you 
Sorry I'm glue and the rest bounces off of you 
And I'm sorry not even this jet's metal wings 
Could get across these simple things 
And I'm sorry if I ever sang your name in vain 
Oh well, sometimes it be that way 


CHORUS


Now flame licks the air with its silver tongue 
Night has many hands but I have just one 
And I'm sorry I walked in on you unexpectedly 
I'm sorry I never served you chamomile tea 
And I'm sorry I didn't always have a match 
That could start a fire big enough for your heart to catch 
And I'm sorry if it was my heart breaking that ruined your day
Oh well, sometimes it be that way 
Oh well, sometimes it be that way"

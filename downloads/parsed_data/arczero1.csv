"event","I haven't updated in a few days, I guess. Still, not much to report... I'm still the same old me... unfortunately. I wish I would change, somehow. I don't mean a radical change, like, a superhero. But I wish something about me would change, to make my life more interesting, more... worth getting up for, in the morning. I get up, go to a mediocre job, come home, play video games, and go to bed. I suppose there are things I could do to change that, but I just wish something outside of my control would change. I've spent so much time training my mind and body for combat, yet, I've never had to do so much as threaten somebody... (at least in a serious manner). I think I would make a great (un)super hero! I may not have special powers or anything, but I certainly know how to cause pain. That would be the coolest job, ever. Yeah, I wouldn't get paid, and I would probably seem like a nut case to the police... but what makes them so special? Why do they think that it's okay if they take a bullet and it's not okay for me to take one? I can see where it's their job to do that, but the crime is more directly my problem. Police perform a service that most people are too afraid to do for themselves... but when someone comes along that isn't afraid to do the same thing, they flip out! I don't wanna wear a blue uniform that practically has a ""Shoot Me!"" sign on the back of it. I wouldn't want to worry about some complicated legal system... Heck, I wouldn't want to be limited to a lame-o little pea-shooter of a gun! I'm talkin' .50 caliber guns and automatics that'll break your wrist. If some moron wants to steal his way to the top, I'll cheat, lie, and blast him back down to the gutter... not stick him in a cell (that I'm paying for), where he can watch TV and get free meals. If some guy wants to rob a bank, screw the bank! Blow up his escape car and watch him wet himself in front of me! Rawr! All that gang violence? I'd start a turf war, I'll take back the city... I'll tear through cars with armor-piercing bullets and use any means necessary to bring the gangs to their knees. They think they're so tough? Wait until they face someone who's willing to fire a gatling gun down a residential street...

Okay, so that's a little over board, but seriously... police don't do much else besides catch reckless drivers and look at dead bodies at the scene. I think this world could use a few vigilante's...

That's enough of that rant, I guess... I just feel so useless, like a relic or something... and people wonder why I play violent video games. It's because it's an outlet, a place where I'm allowed to unleash a bit of the rage I feel. The other day some guys came into where I work and were talking about killing some guy! Oh, how much I wish I could've jumped over the counter and beat the crap out of both of them! Rawr!!! I'm gonna go to bed and dream of a place where I can beat up stuff and stop crime before it starts... stupid lazy good for nothing legal system... making it hard for me to use the few talents I have..."

"event","Recently, I've been somewhat more concerned than usual about my so called 'love life'. I find it somewhat disturbing that I have yet to have a tangible romantic relationship. That, in and of itself is not unusual, but the fact that I have tried, many times in fact, makes it unusual. I mean, if a person hasn't had a relationship until after they're 25 because they don't want to, that's perfectly okay. But, when a person puts much effort, thought, and action into it for several years and has yet to recieve any results, something as gone wrong. I have, however, stopped trying to place any blame on the members of the opposite sex. I place all the blame on myself, whether the blame's nature is direct or indirect, because that's the only logical conclusion. There must be something physically or personally wrong with me in order for this to happen. If a guy is one for one, he got the girl of his dreams on his first try, he's pretty dang lucky. If a guy is one for two, he's still lucky. Even if a guy is one for five, he's doing pretty well for himself. But me, I'm zero for something like thirty. There's something wrong here. I'm talking ratios, if a guy takes out three girls before meeting a girl who want to share a romatic relationship with him, and then, after the relationship ends, he dates another five girls before having another one, he's still got an average of one out of every four girls. I'm at zero out of thirty!? Holy crap! I know 100% pure geeks that have had more luck with women than I have. I know of no hideous disfigurement of my face or body, so I must be at least marginally attractive. What does that leave!? I must have major personality flaw, or a second personality that this one is not aware of, because as far as I know, I'm an acceptable kind of person. 

So what's the deal? Is there some unspoken attrtibute of attraction that nobody told me about, that I apparently fail in? Am I so unreasonably boring that no girl in her right mind would find talking to me an interesting endeavor? Am I found to seem like a jerk because I have a great wealth of knowledge for someone my age? Or are the young women just arbitraily opposed to me? I really want an answer of some kind. Even if it's something I can't change, it would be nice to at least know why it is that I'm stuck here, alone. But the fact that I see nothing excessively wrong with me, either superficially or in terms of personality, drives me nuts. I've contemplated every possible explanation for this. I've thought, ""Maybe all the young women just think I'm already taken, for some reason."" I ruled that one out because I'm sure they're all well aware of my single status. I've thought, ""Maybe all the young women don't know enough about me to like me."" I ruled that out, because if they cared enough to learn about me, they have many ways of gathering that information, including, but not limited to, asking me directly. i've gone through scenarios like those over and over in my head, and I've ruled every one of them out. This doesn't make any sense.

Yeah, the chances of finding someone who likes me are relatively small, but with each failure, that percentage goes up ever so slightly. By performing various calculations, though, I've come to the conclusion that I should be at roughly a 77-81% success rate, taking into account the idea that people tend to become attracted to the people around them and the 'one in a million' theory*. But as everyone knows, attraction and love are anything but logical. If they were, I'd be at a one to one ratio of success, purely because I run numbers all the time. 

Well, I'm done with that rant. I suppose what it comes down to is pure, 100%, unadulterated bad luck on my part. Or, if I wanted to look at this from an optimistic point of view, it's bad luck on the part of all the young women who have turned me down. But, understandably I'm sure, I'm in somewhat of a pessimistic mood, right now.

If your wondering why I'm amused, it's because I'm somewhat amused by all this, purely out of emotional masochism. A trait I've picked up from all this crappy rejection throughout my life... thanks a lot, girls...

And it was also, kind of, the first thing that came to mind when I saw ""Current Mood""... *shrug*

"event","I know I haven't updated this in a little while, not for lack of time or opportunity, but because I just hadn't felt like it. I mean to say that I've felt very confused about what I've wanted to say. There's been so much going on, lately, that I haven't had the opportunity to stop and sort it all out. Even my dreams have been confusing. Like the one I had a few days ago; it's been a sort of recurring dream, but it's not the same each time. It's like each dream is a continuation of that last. I keep having this dream where I live with this girl, but we're only room-mates and we constantly worry about other people thinking we're lovers. The coherent parts of those dreams are usually her and I talking about different people and what they've said about it and telling each other that it doesn't matter what other people think about the situation. I guess in my dream, I feel as though I wish she and I were more than just room-mates, but I don't want to say anything. This got me thinking about a show I watched a long time ago, one of the characters believed that reality was a dream and what everyone else percieved as his dream was his 'reality'. It got me thinking, what if both were true? What if the world we see when we are asleep is just an alternate reality we exist in when this 'conscious' body needs rest? What if Our dreams are more real than we believe them to be because this alternate reality breaks the laws we hold to be true in this reality? Like dreams about flying, or dying over and over again, but coming back. Dreams where you know what other people are thinking because, somehow, you are them at the same time that you are yourself. These are all things we can't comprehend in this reality. But in the world of our dreams this is commonplace and often destructive (like dreams about being killed), so in that reality, we dream about a world where things are more lawful and mundane, as a reprieve from the chaos of reality. That would make a great series of books. Like a story where, somehow, the two realities begin to collide. I should let this body rest, I feel as though my other body is rested enough, now. ;)"

I'm excited, because I have a date for this Friday! :D It's been a good long time since I've been on a date... the last one was when I went with TJ, Megan, and Debra, because Megan had never been to Dicks. Hmm... when was that? I dunno, but it was several months at least. Well, this time I'm taking Debra again, which is exciting. That means it'll be an entertaining date... not that she's inherently funny, she's just great fun to be around, because she shares a similar sense of humor to myself. I'm happy that I get to go with Debra again, but I had been hoping Kristi would've been able to go. She's so quiet, at least from my point of view, and that usually means the person is pretty cool in my book. Most people I can't stand to have talk all the time (with a few exceptions ;P ), but most of the time my favorite people are the ones who don't talk all the time. They like to listen, rather than blather on about ""Johnny is going out with Jenny"" and ""I saw Jenny kissing Bobby""... can't stand that stuff. So, anyways... back to the topic... I was hoping that it would be an opportunity to get her to talk a bit, but instead, it'll be another great opportunity to hang out with Debra. And, for those of you reading this who know the people I'm talking about, if you say anything about this, I'm gonna... uhh... do something mean... :P    Time for bed."

"event","As several people know, I'm a victim of Chronic Depression, which means that on a fairly regular basis I become depressed. Right now, my depression is morphing into a mood where I feel inclined to fight/exercise/go-ninja... basically my masculine hormones that lean towards violence are all on overdrive. Realizing that you're thinking about the most efficient way to twist your manager's arm so that they face away from you so that you can break their shoulder bone with your elbow is a kind of scary experience. Even more disturbing is knowing full well that you're capable of doing it. Luckily for the rest of the world, this will only last another day or two, until I start getting opportunities to cram tuna into my diet. Apparently, there's a chemical in tuna that corrects the imbalance in my brain that causes the depression. Unfortunately, I have to monitor how much tuna I eat, otherwise I'll get poisoned from too much mercury... essentially I'm at risk of becoming a walking thermometer.

I got the third and final legendary weapon from the Kamigawa set today! If you know what I'm talking about, then you can congratulate me, otherwise, ingore that. ^_^

There's a girl who has been invading my thoughts, lately... on the one hand, it's cool... but on the other, it's not. I want to tell everyone about my attraction to this girl, but I know the consequences of doing that. If I tell someone about it, then they'll tell somebody else, and pretty soon, she'll hear about it, deny that she likes me at all and all my chances with her will be flushed down the toilet like an unwanted pregnancy on prom night... (If you can tell me what that's from, I'll give you a cookie...)  All I need to do is work up the balls to tell her that I like her, that way I can get it over with and start the ""rejected process""... (Cynical, aren't I?) I mean, I've never had any success with women, yet, why start now? Maybe it's just my depression talking right now, but I just can't see her liking me that way. She's way above me in every aspect. I don't deserve to live on the same planet as she does, let alone the same city. (Of course, I'm of that opinion for many people, but it's still just as powerful a statement) In any case, I'll never forgive myself if I never try. If she doesn't force herself out of my head, then she'll drive me nuts... of course, if she wants to keep herself there, supplemented by herself, then I'm all for it. ;)"

"event","Nothing especially interesting has occurred lately, I just happened to be thinking and wanted to write down some of my thoughts...

I've contemplated the idea of a 'superhero', and I find the concept quite interesting. Someone who, for some reason, has declared that they are more capable of serving justice than the system of law enforcement in their given area. Some of these heroes are gifted with special abilities, some have trained their entire lives to be what they are, and then there are those, like The Punisher, who are heroes out of necessity, rather than choice. Even if it's unrealistic, especially since it takes an extremely traumatic event for someone to decide that sort of a lifestyle, I think it would be cool to aspire to be a 'superhero'. Something about the life of being poor, having no legal ties to the world, having the freedom to do what needs to be done all seems romantic. I suppose that's why so many people enjoy comics and movies depicting such people. People willing to put everything on the line to protect everyone else, for the pure satisfaction of making a difference. Here I make a distinction, a police officer is no superhero, but they are heroes. The difference is that a superhero is not reimbursed, paid, or otherwise rewarded for what he/she does. A hero is paid and lays it on the line a different way. A hero, like a police officer, is willing to draw their gun and fire on a criminal if the criminal is an immediate threat to the officer, while a superhero has the ability to, without fear of retribution for superceding the law, attack a criminal for no other reason than being there and being a known criminal. A hero follows rules that restrict the amount of justice that can be delivered, a superhero dishes out justice in amounts not possible by a hero, because he is guided by a moral compass rather than a textbook full of laws.

Well, I've run out of flowing thought for that one, however, I did have some more thoughts on realistic situations. I realized that a person is constantly judged based on performance versus average performance of others. Why this is, I'm not sure... would it not make more sense to judge someone based on performance versus prior performance? Sure, I may run a mile seconds faster than my friends, but did I run it any faster than my last time? I may have performed extremely well compared to my co-workers, but it doesn't really mean anything if I still performed less excellently than I had in the past.In the business world, I can understand making such judgements to determine who will advance, but when determining whether a person gets a raise or not shouldn't be a community effort. If in the first period of time I performed perfectly at my job, I would expect to deserve a raise, while if during the next period I, perhaps, was lacking a bit of the effort I portrayed in the first period of time, I would expect that I might not get a raise. In the real world, it seems, a person might receive a raise, so long as they perform marginally better than the majority of their peers. A person might file a piece of paper each day and recieve a raise if his co-workers filed a piece of paper every other day. I believe that a persons progress should only be measured by how well they did versus the last time they checked their abilities. Like in weight lifting, I am not successful unless I progress. I may still be the strongeest person in the weight room, but I am a failure because I did not go anywhere, I didn't push harder.


This is getting awfully lengthy... perhaps I'll finish these thoughts another time."

I'm just 9 days away from Halo 2 goodness. ^_^ I took the rest of that week off from work, so that I can get some experience under my belt for the Halo 2 party set up for that Saturday. Although, some of the people planning to attend that have been cheating... using the pirated copy of Halo 2. However, I will still beat them, because I will go all hardcore on the game during that time off. We're talking 36 hours of play for every 6 hours of sleep. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but I won't be getting alot of rest compared to how much playing I'll be doing. Naturally, I will get a full 10 hours of sleep before the party, so that I'll be completely rested for it. My number one targets are Justin and the Hartsock boys... Gubler, although he beat me in the last party, won't stand much of a chance during this next party. I've been using CounterStrike as a practice utility in the absence of my own copy of Halo, so I feel much more able, now, anyways.

This week, it is my goal to try and make up for the work I missed last week, by working extra hard, and taking any extra hours they offer me. I suspect that this time away form work has given me the mental energy to go back there and take hold of the reigns again, reinvest my efforts, so that they can continue to view me as a valuable asset to the grill team.

Eh, well, I'm out of things that I want to talk about for now... until next time."

I'm really excited for this coming month, Halo 2 comes out and I will also be getting Dead or Alive Ultimate. I'm excited because both of these games are XBox Live games, and I'm really hurtin' for people to play with. Apparently I have a strange taste in games, as compared to my peers. *shrug* But who cares? In other news, I seem to be failing once again in the world of love. The girl I like has interest in other places, and more eligable suitors following her around, than myself. Not really a surprise to me, that this would happen... I seem to be cursed in love. Well, until next time!"

"event","I just got a new wireless network adapter for my computer last night. This one has proven already to be way more reliable than my old one. My old one had this bad habit of just deciding that it didn't want to remain connected/turned on. In other news, I finally get to cash my paycheck today. My brother's been too lazy to take me down to the bank so I can have money again. Unfortunately, most of my paycheck is going right down the drain... but oh well, my next paycheck is just over a week away, anyways.

Last night I made a few calls to try and find a date for this Friday, but with no success. Most of the girls my age, that I know, are going to a football game this Friday. I can't seem to think of any plausible possibilities, besides the ones that are going. I suppose I could ask some people from down where I used to live, but that might prove a bit tricky. Some of them have their Homecoming football game this Friday, as well. Hmm... I suppose it would be possible for me to have Ryan (He and  I always set up double dates, because it's more fun than going solo) ask his date if we can move it to next Friday, or something. ""Why not Saturday?"" you ask? Because Saturday is the Homecoming dance, of course. I may be naive enough to not realize it's homecoming week, but I'm not stupid enough to think that these girls aren't attractive enough to have dates for the dance. (Shoot, with some of them, I'd be surprised if they didn't have lines of guys asking them out.) Yeah, that's what I'll do, I'll press for a postpone of the double date until next Friday. That'll give me enough time to find a date for it ad figure out some sort of activity for the double date, since Ryan and I have a tendancy to just make it up as we go along. (^_^)

I suppose that's all I have to write about for the time being. I'll post again, soon."

"event","Well, I''m not exactly sure what to put down here, but I suppose I could talk about my day, today. It was kind of average, because I didn't really do anything exciting, and nothing really exciting happened. I got up this morning, went to work, came home a messed around on my computer. Now, here I sit, a brand new member of LJ, not sure of what I'm going to write, but I'm sure to write something. It seems I always feel like writing something, I just don't always know what I want to to write.

I used to hate the idea of having a blog, because I would like to actually write in it as though it were a journal, but I'd be afraid that my friends or family would read it and be like, ""I didn't do that!"" or ""That's a rude thing to say about that person!"".  But now, I'm just, like, ""Whatever, if I'm writing something in here that makes another person look bad, it's because that is the side of them they were showing me at the time."" These journals aren't unilateral progressive omniscient novels, they're merely the one-sided experiences of a person. If I were to type, say, ""My brother is a complete idiot."" he would likely get frustrated with me, for having written something like that where people can see. However, the point would be that I think he's an idiot at that moment, other times I may think he's a genius. Another fear I had of writing in such a place where my friends can see, is that I tend to be a very ""closed-book"" kind of person with my feelings. Especially those of a romantic nature. So if I were to write about my thoughts and feelings, concerning my relationship desires, I would feel very exposed to my friends, like I no longer had any secrets. (Yes, I keep secrets from everyone, especially the people close to me, and it's a critical psychological respite for myself.) The way I've reasoned my way out of this, is: perhaps I should share some of my feelings with my friends... however, the fear remains, that, if I were to share my feelings, I would end up losing my chances with the girls I like because my blatant feelings would scare them off. Meh, whatever...

That's something I could share with you people: a brief history on my love life (or, rahter, the lack thereof). I have never had a ""girlfriend"", as a matter of fact, I've never been kissed. Heck, I'm probably lucky I've ever been hugged by someone I'm not related to. This, I don't really understand. I've tried darn near every approach there is, none of them have worked. Bleh, I don't really have the focus right now to finish this paragraph's thought. Maybe later.

I'm feeling kind of tired right now, so I'll update again, soon."

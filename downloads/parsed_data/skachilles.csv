"event","Today I was thinking back to 3rd grade. This boy named Tom had a little scar on his face, so of course us other kids wanted to know what it came from. Well he told us his grandmothers's dog bit him in the face... how unfortunate. Tom then went on to tell us his family sued his grandmother for it. At the time, that sounded abominable, now it just sounds like life.

SM played their first show last night, sounds like it was great.  I am getting sound clips of it now, makes me sad I live so far from Jersey.  

Today I got a breakfast burrito and went to the bookstore 3rd hour before auto tech.  I bought ""Cat's Cradle"" by Vonnegut.  Other than that I got some icecream and watched soutpark.

"event","I am so aloof and listless lately.  Today in 6th hour the teacher was talking about maturity being the ability to own up to your actions and recieve the consequences deserved.  Well I got to thinking that by that standard, nearly everyone is immature.  In the class there is a nice little recliner.  I'm always the first one to class because nearly everyone eles is always late, so I sit in it usually.  Well a girl sits almost right in front of it, and during the teachers speech she pulled out a piece of paper that was clearly in my view.  She started writing and I figured it was to a friend naturally, but at the top, ""mom,.."" caught my eye.  I know its not my buisness and I had a lot of trouble deciding at the time, but I decided to read.  Shes a lefty, so you would always see the begining of the sentance once she finished and her hand was out of the way.  She started off saying she was sorry for all the shit she put her mom through this summer with her drug problem, then saying how she could never make it up to her.  Then she started a new paragraph ""I just need you to know I still-"" then she stopped, and I looked away.  I honestly didn't want to know, buy my curiousity is bigger than anything inside me so I had to look.  The pause took what seemed like forever.  Her eyes were red and her hands shaking, she continued ""-doing drugs.""  I have no idea, but I felt so... dissapointed.  I have never even talked to the girl, and I was reading this incredibly private letter that was killing her inside to write and I had the audacity to be dissapointed in her.  I know, I know.  She went on to say she quit coke, but was onto harder drugs and didn't feel like she would ever be able to quit, that she felt she ""would always need a fix.""

It all got me to thinking about my life, and honestly, I need to change a few things- I just don't know how.

I went out to look for a job today, thats about it.  Tomorrow I will go work out after school, drink some green tea, read, watch southpark and go to bed.  I lead a boring life these days."

"event","Its so hard to give up some one you care about.  I don't know if its really giving up, or freeing myself.  I think she taught me how to love.  She definatly taught me how to live.  Then again, she taught me to be lonely, spereated and how to long for something you can never have.  She knows me better than anyone, we met well over a year and a half ago.  Every day I spent with her rank as my favorites.  Walking with my arm around her, talking about the world, pretending it would last forever.  Its hard to let go.  She has a whole different life, far far away that I have been slowly phased out of till now when I am barely aknowledged.  Still, I can't get her out of my head.  Meeting her and having her in my life has made a big part of my direction, and now its going the wrong way.  I can never have her, she loves some one eles, lives just under a thousand miles away, and stopped caring long ago.  Thing is, I can't free myself from her.  I keep hoping things will go back to the way they were, but they wont.  the distance is too much now, and in order to move on, I think its best I just say good bye one last time and hold to it...

In other news, Alison has a boyfriend and wont talk to me, Bonnie ignores my calls, Genny couldn't care less, and I've never been more alone.

I hold the ball upside down, no thumb, awful aproach, but I can throw it so fucking hard and it will seriously hook the entire width of the lane if I am not careful.  Its interesting to say the least, mostly for others.  Nothing big happened today.  Just more of the same old shit; girls fuck with me, school, car, thats about it.  Noteable accomplishment of the day is setting off two car alarms in advertantly.  I hardly ever rev my engine, I think it is white trashish(fuck you, it works) but today a guy was begging me to after hearing it take off down the street many times so I did in the school parking lot, and not one, but TWO car alarms nearby went off!  Fear the LT1 with 3"" duals and no cats!  Hopefully seeing Bonnie either Friday or Saturday night and if I get lucky(which I never do) Jenny also.

Bonnie and I are going to try again for next weekend which is cool I guess, but it was a little dissapointing.  Ended up just driving by the COSR meet because it looked pretty shitty, not worth even stopping in.  After that I cruised for a little bit, not looking for a race or anything, just wasting time.  Ended up watching the Southpark movie with my friend and her boyfriend, that movie never seems to get old.  After that my friend Andrew called me and we tore up the city in his T/A.  My car is faster but I am not as retarded as him so we take his car.  You know how it is.

Today I decided this is going to be one long fucking year, and believe me, I will be counting the days.  I made it to my first class on time this morning suprisingly- Sociology, room 604.  Teacher is alright, I don't think its going to take any effort to pass.  Not must in the way of girls in the class(like all my classes, goddam sausage parties), we'll think on the bright side and call it a ""distraction free class room.""  Not really in the mood to talk about my classes and there isn't much to tell yet.  Just a bunch of ""Hi my name is ____ and I spent my summer whacking off"" bullshit.  Looking over the parking lot, it appears I could actually have the fastest car there.  High School drags are one week from today and I need to still re-do my rear suspension so I can get rid of wheel hop.  High school drags is the worst bracket racing event of the year.  Its all about who has the nicest looking car and the hottest girl in the seat next to them, not who is the fastest or best bracket racer.  Oh well, if I take a girl with me I'll have all of the above.  Now who do I take?"

That's all I ever get.  It's not like I'm not swinging hard enough.  I keep my eye on the ball.  I watch it all the way in, I just can't seem to hit it.  When I swing I swing for the fences but that doesn't do any good.  My timing is never off.  I stay too far back in the box.  It always breaks right before it gets to me, slides right under my bat.  All I can think to do is move up and take sharper swifter cuts.  No waiting for the fastball that never comes.  Every pitch has to count.  Each pitch needs to be taken like the game is all on it.  In a way it really is.

Here are things in a nutshell:

-I got a job
-New car
-Car payment

That is it for the most part.  Ever realise how dull your life is when it's all listed out?  I guess now I will go into a little detail about my job.  I make pretty much nothing for doing quite a bit.  I am the one that puts up with the impulsivly hungry movie patrons of the world.  Majority being extreamly easy to manipulate.  You make a suggestion and they are either too weak to say no, or just not smart enough to realise that when I say ""It's a better value""  I really mean ""I am supposed to con you into buying this because it costs more.""  I am good at my job.  I had well over $1,500 in my drawer on friday night.  I am looking to be promoted fast.  I know who's ass to kiss and how to do it.  I know what to say and when.  I am taking that bitch over.  I've really only met one prospect.  Thing is, I can't read her.  I am ubnormally bad at reading girls as it is, but she really has me stumped.  Most people that talk to me on a personal basis know that I pick up on a lot.  Physically I have observed more than normal, but on an emotional level I am getting nothing.  She is friendly to everyone which is the problem.  I am having problems finding any differences.  I have deciphered fragments but it is probably nothing.  If you look deep enough for something, you can inadvertantly cause yourself to find it.  I am trying to avoid that.  Most of the other attractive girls are older and in possissions that I never come into contact with.  The aforementioned girl is the only one I can't get out of my head.  At first I was skepticle of if I even though of her decently.  Maybe I am just looking for some one and she is there and a possibility so I am finding things to like about her that don't exist?  Sounds just like what I went over.  Today we weren't very busy so I was sent home a little early.  Earlier on in the day, what I assume was a daycare or something like that came in.  13 kids, 3 people incharge.  I'll start with the higher-ups.  Two female, one male.  After observing the children for about nine seconds I thought to my self ""Why the fuck is this guy doing this?  He looks like he wants to stab one.  Hell, I want to stab one.""  Then what should have been so obvious presented in the form of a 5'5"" blond.  This girl was ridiculously gorgeous.  I didn't notice her at first becauase she came in last and 13 dirty, sticky, running, screaming children had my attention.  She came to my line which warrented a co-worker calling me a ""lucky mother fucker.""  While she was there, I sure was.  No refuting that.  Her hair bounced in sync with her hips.  Her lips beared the sweetest voice.  For a while I almost envied that guy.  When they came to my line to buy things, I envied everyone.  Shouldn't kids over 7 be able to count?  Jesus Christ, I have never seen suck ignorance in my life.  I stayed polite because I am taking that place over, remember?  One greasy kid ordered $24 worth of stuff. I made him pay beforehand because I doubted he was good for it.  I was right, he had $2.43 in pennys, nickles and dimes.  it took quite a while to explain how currency works and that $2.43 and $24 are different.  The Goddess made him buy some candy and leave.  I almost messed up the next few orders because I was so inthrawled in her.  One little girl came throught the line three times to order three boxes of nerds.  I don't think she knows that you can buy more than one thing at a time.  Once they were all gone, everything was slow and boring.  The sole girl of my interest that I work with showed up with a friend and what seemed to be a younger brother of one of the two.  I was busy sweeping but made my way over near her and we joked around a tiny bit and I was commanded to go home.  Here's the ending you have all been waiting for- I went home.

After that I went for a long drive with no purpose and here I am.  Other things happened but this is all for now.

I have tomorrow off, I might start writing in this thing more often just so I can look back on it and see how the situation progressed."

"event","Day started easily enough.  Wake up, have a nice glass of milk, take a shower, friend calls and asks if I would like to go look for jobs with him.  Same thing nearly every day.  Agreement is that I go pick him up, so I do.  Not long after picking him up he tells me that he is desperate for work only because if he gets a job this week his father has agreed to buy him a new car.  Earlier that morning he called and got an interview with ""CoPIRG""  Neither of us had any idea what it is or what he was even applying for.  He was supposed to go in at 4 PM, I'll get back to that.  Time being about 11:00 AM we went to the theater I already applied at so he could apply and I then applied again.  The girl took our applications so she could go stock the bathroom with them like always.  From there we hit ""Checkers Auto Parts""; ""Dairy Queen""; ""Papa Johns Pizza.""  We then retreated back to my house to get directions off of mapquest.com and got into an interesting conversation about the orgasmic nature of soccer fans when their favored team scores a goal.  When we left heading for the Mall We would yeall ""GOAL!!!!!"" At every person we saw and every car that we passed, it was mildly amusing throughout.  Right after getting to the mall we saw a friend of ours who had already tried most places and told us who was accepting applications and who was not.  Most places take applications even if they are not hiring which is probably why out of my sixteen, yes that is right ladies and gentlemen, sixteen applications submitted have come up with nothing.  We hit 3 places I don't even care to remember then it was 3:10 PM so we left to go to his house so I could drop him off.  He asked me to come along to his interview because he would get lost as it was in Lodo.  So we went, traffic was bad on teh highway because of an accident, after we fought past it it was a smooth ride the rest of the way.  After passing the place twice we figured out that it was the right one.  I had an entire thirty cents on me to put in the parking meter which gave us 18 minutes.  We were running 4 minutes late and it was like a group orientation thing so I was invited to partake.  In need of work I obliged.  The girl ragged on about the environment for 18 minutes(I timed it) Then she played a 6 minute video.  Then told us what the actual job is.  What you do is go around to houses for NINE HOURS a day five days a week (that's 45 hours a week, being under 18, that's not even legal in Colorado) begging people for donations to help prevent manifest destiny.  She said it payed $250 a week so I was interested.  She began taking people into a room and doing interviews.  Wach lasted at minimum 14 minutes, longest 18 minutes.  I was last out of five, they all got hired including my friend.  Well Upon mine she asks ""First of all do you have any questions?""  So I asked about the pay.  It turns out, you get $250 in a week IF you meet a quota of $100 per night in donations per night.  So I asked ""So if you get $20 in nine hours you get paid $10?"" and she painfully said yes.  So this is where I had a problem.  We would be taking peoples money under the understanding that they are donating it to nature and that stuff.  Well, if 50% is going to the person collectings pocket, I'd say 25% goes to the organisation it's self as it seems to be somewhat lucrative, and then at least another 10% goes to pay the ""supervisors"" as they make a solid paycheck each week she said.  That means that 15% is actually getting its intended use.  That means if you donate 20 dollars, 3 of that is being put to use.  Morally I could not partake in that.  We never got passed the questioning part.  My total interview time was 2 minutes and I was fortunatly not hired.  On the way out we found a small stand giving out free copies of ""The Onion"" so we each took one.  On the way back home I pointed out the serious faults in teh job and my friend decided he was quitting.  He did not ask questions so the job sounded nice to him.  He then told me about how his father offered him a job with his company for FOURTEEN FIFTY AN HOUR.  I could not comprehend why he was even looking for a job when that was at his feet.  

Still jobless."

"event","I got to thinking today about my place in society.  I don't really have one.  Thnking about the American society, I really don't fit in.  The first thing that comes to mind is my morals.  Life would be so much easier with out them.  Not to sound Nick Carraway-ish but I am one of the few honest people I know.  I keep a lot of my feelings to myself for the plain fact that I really don't trust most people, nor should I.  I don't cheat.  I don't lie.  I don't steal.  I do care.  What shaped these strong morals of mine?  I am not religious.  I've regreted puting others before my self many times yet I still do it any way.  I never pass blame, A few time's I've even taken unwarrented blame just to protect some one.  I also go to thinking about love, or lack thereof.  Why haven't I told anyone I love them in the last 9 years?  Then again, why hasn't anyone told me?"

"event","Things are going good today.  The begining of the day I got my final project for English, not what I was expecting but still alright.  We have to do an 18-21 minute oral presentation on an author of our choice.  Naturally I picked Hemingway(if you have ever talked to me on the subject of literature you would understand).  In American History we just did review for our final test.  I missed Science because I was getting my classes for next year.  The counselor did a really bad job so later today while I was mowing my lawn I reconfigured it in my mind and it works perfectly.  With my config I will get more credits, have less off hours.  Only down side is that I will be taking some harder classes.  One I will be eligable for college credit at CU.  If I apply myself I wont have any problems.  I was given the choice of Advanced Latin or Physics II and I reluctantly chose Advanced Latin.  Nothing eles important happened till Latin.  The female junior and I had an especially nice conversation today.  After that she was demonstrating how to do this jump spin thing.  

Not much to say today 

Might be getting a car in a few days also."

"event","Todays most important events all transpired in the span of about 90 seconds.  I am always early to class, just because I have nothing better to do.  My first class of the day starts at 8:01 am.  I started walking down the hallway directly to it at 7:53 am.  Very near to it is a huge bay window overlokking our glorious overcrowded parking lot.  Standing near the glass I see two ver cute freshman so peacfully singing ""amazing grace.""  Why they were I doubt I will ever know nor is it important but it sounded very beautiful.  I slowed my pace drastically and noticed how surreal it looked with the sun behind them.  Another girl which I have seen roaming the halls quite a bit joined in and only helped the tone.  it lasted only maybe 10 seconds but none the less was good.  It wasn't really the song, it was the concord trinity so serene.  Still 7:54am another girl a ways down the halls staccato rang out telling them to be quite.  This angered me.  Utopia to dystopia in seconds.  They had unexplainable renewd some hope in my eyes of society but this other girl tore it down.  With the girl was another girl I have come to be very fond of but after she was actually mocking the three girls.  She is in the school choir so I really would have never expected it.  It was then that I decided I no longer liked her.  Between her hipocritical act and how little I actually know her despite what I have observed over the last 8 months, I was totally over anything I once thought I felt for her.  I am not really going to look for a high school relationship any more.  More than likely nothing positive would come of it.  I am very stoic so I have come to desire a somewhat reserved girl.  My standards in general could be seen as too high but I refuse to 'settle.'  There is no reason to persue something so pointless unless I have at least some reason to think something would work out.  Thus far I have seen no evidence of this."

"event","My first class of the day the teacher is often late.  Somehow kids can still manage to casually stroll in later than her.  Some try to sneak even with the teacher is watching.  Today we had to do a comparison of groups throughout history to the migrants in ""The Grapes of Wrath.""  The girl in my ""group""(Group just means I do all the work while the others talk)was mad when I told her that Rose of Sharon's baby dies in the last chapters(she didn't get around to reading).  I ended up writing the entire essay myself for two reasons.  A) if I wanted it to be done decently I had to do it myself  and B) they wouldn't have done it anyway.  Fueding started early when one very attractive girl(apperences only, but I'll get to that later) said something that was....well less than intelegent.  Another girl decided to tell her how stupid it was, profanity was her weapon of chioce.  Nothing much came out of that but I was almost glad it happened.  The attractive girl has said some things that have just made me cringe but not enough to fully turn me off.  Her boyfriend supposedly beat some guy up for merely suggesting that she was ""hot.""  This thrilled her.  Moving onto History the class got to go out side to the ""wetlands"" for no reason at all but I enjoyed it.  My friend ditched me to walk with some girl that has never payed attention to him before, I didn't mind since I deemed that a worthy cause.  I then walked with another friend and this one girl.  She is pretty and some what fun to be around but I don't see anything there.   Once in the past she, another guy and I played a very mean joke on a guy but he deserved it.  Besides long dry uncut grass and a small pond not much was to be seen.  In science the friend that ditched me propelled himself to new hights of negative attention with eating a large styrophome ball.  Later a kid threw part of one at him and he punched the kid, the first time I have ever noticed him retaliate.  I was standing in the middle already so I served as mediator but I was proud of him.  Lunch sucked, I won't even talk about it.  In math I had finished everything so I just read.  Latin yet another fight broke out over somethign petty but nothing much came of it.  Afterwords i came home ate a slicke of old pizza and had a large glass of milk.  Today I noticed how easily tempers can be sparked to conflict."

"event","All my sorrowed beliefs from the past and premature assumptions of the future are colliding.  Everything I once held true I am begining to reverberate upon, slowy tracing back over.  No reflections of the past shine through as I progress into the future, I have learned nothing of my mistakes.  It feels like I am walking straight into what I have always feared with echos of time lost, time left, and time unseen.  Throughout my life nothing has ever givin me greayer pleasure than learning.  I can compair it to some's yearning to meet new people.  Along with that I have always thrived in being proven wrong but it has become a rarety.  Maybe that's a good thing.  When I am proven wrong, relearning correctly what I once failed at I don't dwell on petty indiference but on triumph.  Through out my life I can remember one time that has always stuck out in my mind reguardless of how miniscule it may be.  I was about 5 years old and I would spend the day with my grandmother during the summer while my mother was at work.  She had me help her in the yard and once and only once was I shouldered with the responsibility of watering a young tree.  Based upon all my current knowledge I wattd theleaves rather than the ground below so the roots could absorb water.  Now this all seems silly and I am almost ashamed of admitting it as it now seems such common practice but it is as close as I can remember to experiencing the process.  With everything you learn it somehow contributes to your belief system, even if in just the way somethign simple works.  What I got out of this is that everything is deeper than ever imagined.  Everything is made of tiers, starting with a base.  Nothing can be considered static, chaos prevails in every system.  When a child is growing up in school the three numberes that are embeded into every mind are 9-1-1.  At the most vulnerable time in a mind's life it is pushed to fully trust the governmet, only through age and indevidual trials is it set to reject, question, or accept these values.  Socially speaking the values I have always been subjected to are to get good grades, go to college, get married, have a family, hord away money for future generations, and then die.  Untill recently that has been my plan, but where is it's base?  Everything to me seems to begin with death and work backwords to the top.  I plan on attending college, but every major I want to persue is not lucrative by any standards outside of happyness.  If I am nto happy what am I living for?  working my way backwords to the base of all societies structure?  Marriage seems to be teh only thing I am content with.  I want to fall in love even though I never have been.  Out of my entire family The only one I ever see is my mother, and that is sparatic at best.  I can't remember teh last time I actually said that I loved someone.  I guess what I am looking forward to is nto so much marriage but meeting a girl I could fall in love with and could put up with me enough to at least at one point think that we could live together untill we reach the base of lifes plan.  death.  Today was an interesting day in how painfully realised how deep what was though shallow can be."

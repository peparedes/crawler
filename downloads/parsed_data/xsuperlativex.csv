&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have never made plans like that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not with my bests, not with [[boyfriend]]. No one.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it is because I don't trust people, and because I'm so afraid of being let down when the plans don't happen. I don't want to open up to anyone,&nbsp;ever. The most I've ever opened up to anyone is to [[friend]]. And now she is switching schools. I am going to miss her more than anything ever. I'm crying at the thought of her leaving. She means a whole whole lot to me, she is an absolutely amazing person.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow I need to&nbsp; really talk with him.

Because I couldn't find what she needed me to find, and I wasn't even the one who lost it. I was in the basement for a total of probably an hour looking for a cock gun and liquid nails. Both of which were backstage <strong>upstairs</strong>. She is the one who put me in the basement by myself with nails lying all over the place.

The entire night was just a bust. And I feel so bad for cracking. But [[friend]] asked me, quietly, what was wrong. They had both asked me before if I was okay, but it was in front of everyone. She just asked me quietly what was wrong.<br /><br />""I'm underwhelmed.""<br /><br />She asked if it was with [[boyfriend]]. I told her it had nothing to do with him. He is amazing. ""I don't know what he sees in me."" And then I just started crying and she hugged me and told me <em>she</em> sees what he sees in me, but I still have absolutely <strong>no </strong>idea. And it eats at me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been told my whole life that I'm not good enough.

I love the feeling of when he is driving and we are holding hands, and he squeezes my hand. Not to crush me or anything. A gentle, but firm squeeze. It's amazing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today [[friend]] asked me what I think is holding me back from **v*ing him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid he will hurt me. I don't think he will, nothing gives me that impression. I'm just scared to be vulnerable to him. I'm afraid that as he gets to know me better he won't like me anymore, he won't want me anymore. It makes me sad to admit that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not that I don't trust him. I do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But most of the things I tell him not because I want to, but because I feel like I should.

I think it is the sweetest thing. Yesterday was a good day.<br /><br />I don't know where today went wrong. I don't. It makes me sick. I am in tears right now, with no desire to speak with anyone but him or [[friend]]. I can't call [[boyfriend]]. He isn't hanging out with me tonight because he had other things to do. I sound absolutely disgusting for even thinking this, but shouldn't he want to cheer me up? The prospect of seeing him tonight had me at least looking forward to something.<br /><br />I don't know why I even bother getting my hopes up for anything anymore.<br /><br />I could call [[friend]]. But she is so in love that it makes me insecure about my own relationship. She makes me question what I have, with how head-over-heels she is.<br /><br /><br /><br />I want someone to do something thoughtful.<br /><br /><br />Instead I will lay by myself all night, listen to Matchbox Twenty, cut myself, cry, and wallow in self-pity.</p>"

He did pay for me though, which I was kind of hoping he would, and kind of hoping he wouldn't. Cause if he wouldn't have, I would've been a little like ""Yeah, he lets me pay for myself!"" but also a little, ""So does he not <i>want</i> to pay for me?""

Then we drove around for awhile, cause it was Saturday morning, so there was nothing really we could do. It was fun though, just driving with him.

Then we went to tech.

"event","So I'm going to do my homework. Like right now. I'm about to do it. It's just really hard for me to focus on it, I'm rarely in the right state of mind for it, and usually when I get there I have a disagreement with a parental unit and am immediately taken out of it. Right now I have to be downstairs because of the wireless internet being faulty and instead having to be plugged in. I'm in the wrong environment.

I know it seems like I'm just making excuses but whatever I am just really upset. I just started my period, my gifts from my parents are the most selfish things, I have a headache, and I'm commando right now because my maternal refuses to do the laundry. Have you ever been commando on your period? It is definately not reccommended. And I don't even have any fucking tampons, so I had to shove some toilet paper in my goddamn vagina, as I can't wear a pad, from the lack of clean underwear.

I don't want to do the work. I have to, but I know it's not enough. December, she wouldn't even bargain with me for grades. I really really really REALLY wanted to see my band in Wisconsin, which is only like 5 hours away, and she wouldn't even bargain with me for grades. I actually tried. I actually tried to get all As to shove it in her face and make her take me, but she wouldn't and I couldn't. That is why I don't want to do the work. I am so fucking afraid that it isn't going to be good enough. And even if I try the hardest I possibly can, and it's not the best that can be achieved, they don't even BELIEVE I tried, so I don't even get that sort of credit.

I really really don't want to be doing this at all. I am so thoroughly fed up with everyone. I told [[friend]] that I liked a boy and she was like, oh yeah I liked him last year and then tried to get me to hit on him FOR HER. Except she is dating a boy right now and it's most unfair that she can do that. And I told her I wouldn't even do anything, because she used to be like ""in love"" with him. And I told her she means more to me and she does, but I do not think she should let me let her get in the way. If our roles were reversed, I would most definately be telling her to fuck him or something. But that's just the kind of person I am. I am the person who is always there for everyone else, and when I ask someone to be there for me, they aren't. Because they have better things to do than listen to some pathetic little girl cry her heart out. And I always get replaced.

And to top it off, I have the hugest fucking pores you've ever seen in your life."

"event","I absolutely do not like the winter. I don't like snow, I don't like cold, I don't like when snow gets on your shoes and the bottom of your pants and you go inside and take off your shoes, but the snow is still on your pants and it makes your ankles really cold, i don't like Forced Family Fun, I don't like being near my siblings, and I don't like the holidays.

They got me American Eagle mittens. From American Eagle. And I don't know what to say to them. Because they were from American Eagle, right, so they were definately expensive, and they were the kind that cut off the ends of the fingers, but have the little bit to cover them up again. But they're from American Eagle. And I know Ria knows that I don't like that store at. all. And Ria definately knows that. And she was the one who knew I wanted the kind of gloves that dont have finger tips. And the gloves are like, light pink and white and gray. And my jacket is like a dark green color. I didn't know what to say to them. So I was just like, yes, it's cool, yes, i like it, uh huh...

So now I am talking to [friend] and she doesn't even know I'm crying but it's okay because she is helping me without even knowing it."

"event","<P>Turns out the ""contest"" I entered that I worked extremely hard on is actually a ""sweepstakes."" Which means it doesn't matter how good or bad the entry was, because it is a completely random drawing. So it doesn't matter that I worked six hours a night for three consecutive nights to make it the best I could, because it could've been a picure of me in a band shirt with a santa hat on and i would've had the same&nbsp;chance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am very upset by this.</P>"

<P>I am in PJs and slippers. Because I refuse to walk on their stupid cold floors barefoot, and I did not bring these things from home for nothing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm kind of upset, but mostly excited to enter a contest thing that I worked really hard on.</P>"

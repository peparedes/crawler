What's wrong with me and my baby. 
We ain't gettin' down like we used to do, 
I mean it's pretty good now, but there was a time, 
When it didn't work too well. 

I went down to see this Gypsy woman, you understand, 
I told her my story, I told her what was goin' on. 
And she told me, man she said, all you need, all you need, 
She said all you got to have, oh Lord, 
Just a touch of Mojo's hand, oh bring it back on, 
And it feels pretty good, yes indeed."

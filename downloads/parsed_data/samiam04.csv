"event","I'm not going to school this summer, and part of me now thinks that I should ahve, but oh well. No money = no school, so what can I do? So now, I work liek crazy and yet somehow I have not been able to save any money-go figure. I haven't done any of my crazy shopping splurges in a while so thats what I did with my last paycheck, and I had a car payment and a HUGE insurance payment that I had to pay...it was equal to like 2 1/2 of my normal payment b/c they failed to send us a bill for 2 months in a row. So now I am back to square one with no money, but hopefully now that I am current on my insurance I can go back to saving SOME money...man, I used to be good at doing that, but not anymore.

I really want to move out.....no scratch that--I NEED to move out. Just to know what it's like to be on my own, and if I end up back here a few months later, than thats what happens. But I just want the experience. So hpefully V will come through and actually eb serious about getting an apt. together. 

Side Note: The Phi Sigs are HOT. yep yep. Not all fo them , but alot of them! hehehe **wink**

I had fun last night with all of the girls. Who knew they were so crazy?! lol. Its so much fun having so many girls I can count on. 

I hung out with Mar and Julio the other, night. That was great just getting to catch up with each other. It was cool that we can still click after so much time appart. 

I am just so calm right now. Things don't seem to bother me so much. I have just been so mellow lately-that's why I was so happy to just let loose last night. :)

OK, so I can't think of much else to say-life is good, but boring. And Joe is a HOTTIE!! MAN O MAN!!! :)"

"event","So I got over the whole Rene fiasco. That was such a waste of time. Being depressed over someone I never liked anyway seemed pointless. I woke up the next morning as chipper as ever and I have been so happy since I learned the truth and stopped lying to myself. I am so much better than that and I don't need to make myself something I'm not. I'm not a girl who will sit around forever waiting on some guy to make up his mind. Ignoring my phone calls is so juvenile, so I havent called him since I learned what his whole game was and he hasn't called me. So, I guess that should tell me something. I think that once he realized he wasn't getting in my pants is when things changed. Which just says what kind of person he is. Oh, well. When I see him, I will be nice and just act as though we lost touch.....

So, now, I have a real crush...something I can honestly say I haven't had since junior year. When I first met Joe, i t hought he was such a cutie....then I got to know him....what a fun guy. We are always joking and there is a lot of flirting on my part....always a fun thing! And those eyes....WOW! So yeah totally crushing on this hottie and totally loving it.

I am so happy right now....and i love this feeling. Even when work sucks....it doesn't shake me. I had a good time at the island last weekend with Mar and I had fun with Dana Marie at dinner last night. Good times!! I can't wait to get back down to the beach-- I love it down there!"

"event","I just want someone to love. Is that too much to ask? I'm beginning to think that it is. Again I have been turned down. For some reason this time is different though. I felt like my world fell apart last night. I think I always knew it was just a game to him, but I wouldn't let myself awknowledge that. I wanted to think that someone could actually genuinely like me, and I felt special-I wanted to do whatever I could to make sure that I didn't lose that feeling. I have never felt like such an idiot. I am so embarrassed. I just wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to do what I did. I kissed him--to some that's not a big deal-to me, it is. Last night I couldn't sleep and I just kept crying. My sister was listening to the Ataris and I started balling b/c it reminded me of him. I mean i wasn't even dating this guy but I hurt so much. I had worked so hard on my self-esteem. I used to not have any! Now, I feel like I'm back where I was a few years ago. It's not a good place to be and I don't like it. Why do I let guys' opinions of me affect me so much? Who are they to tell me if I am a good person or not?? The only thing that matters is that I'm comfortable with who I am. And I was. Now, I feel like I have to find her again....and who knows how long that might take. 

I can't help feeling that I did something wrong though...nothing comes to mind...other than I kept hoping things would change after he would treat me like crap. Maybe one day I will get this whole dating thing under control and I will start to understand what is expected of me. What I am supposed to do. 

....I think I need a makeover...yeah....thats it...change the hair, lose some weight. Things I need to do anyway....but now I have a reason to. I need to catch someone.....anyone's eye. Dana says she has someone in mind...but I'm hesitant. I guess we'll just have to see what the rest of the summer has in store for me. It did just start, although really CRAPPY. 

I'll survive though. I've been rejected before, I know the feeling well and I'll live. It might take me some time....but I'll get through it....afterall, how can i not?"

"event","It seems like I am always the one people come to with dating problems. I find this quite entertaining though b/c I have never even been in a relationship. I like helping my friends as much as I can though, however I don't know how much help I actually am. I've been so pre-occupied with H and Dana that I haven't been able to focus on my dilemma with Rene. I hope that those two can get their mids made up about one another so I can focus on me...and maybe get them to help me out as well, though I don't know that I have much to even try to save with Rene....and that sucks. He was the first guy I kissed that it even meant anything to me. It wasn't some earth shaking event, but it made me get butterflies in my stomach. It was a good feeling. He makes me comfortable and I like just being around him. When he came to the airport, my heart jumped (just a little) I was so thrilled to see him. I just want to talk to him, but for whateer reason he has chosen to ignore me. I don't get it. There must be SOMETHING wrong with me......"

I can't go back to the way things were this time last year. Speding time with all of my friends...Marian, Jenny, Julio, Sarah, KC, Josh, Nancy, David....and everyone else.

It's hard to think that my first year of college is over, and so hard to believe how far I've come. I went from being bitter about going to PANAM to being excited to go to class b'c of the amazing ppl I've met. Who whould have thought that at PANAM I would join a soroity? But that has been the best decision I've made. I've had my ups and downs, but made it through, becoming a stronger person for it all. I think I have  better understnading of who I am and I have learned to liek her and appreciate her.

We had a decent time at the concert last night and we even held hands for some of the time and I got a kiss on the cheek....so *yay* for me. We'll just have to see where this goes. I'm kinda nervous about not seeing him this summer though, even though I am sure we will run into one another at some point in time, at least I hope we will hang out some. I met his sister last night too....and realized that I need to keep my mouth shut at time. She is a sweet girl and I thought she was really nice....no clue on what she thinks about me, but I hope i made a good impression. 

I almost kissed him last night, but I stopped myself. i don't know why though. i'm just someone who needs things to go slow. I mean, not even a week ago I wanted to kill him and now here we are holding hands and ""cuddling"" in a sense. So, I stopped myself....he didn't seem too upset though. At least I hope he wasn't...and I'm not easy so I didnt want to give that impression either....even though it was only going to be a kiss.....ahhh I make a bigger deal out of things than needs to be. 

Anyway, summer is almost here and i still dont know if i want to take classes....part of me feels that i should take at least 2...during summer 2 and right now....that is what i am leaning towards....but do i take them at TSTC or PANAM???? another debated issue....what I do know is that I need to make a decision FAST!"

"event","I have come to the conclusion that I am destined to be alone. Quick Recap:

I met Rene, it seemed that there was a mutual liking, we flirted and got to know each other as best one could in like 3 weeks, it seemed everything was going OK. Today, he's back with his ex, at least this is what I'm hearing from all of my friends. Yeah, so that's a nice thing to go to school to today. 

Now, I know that we didn't have anything, I'm not one of those girls who will put all that I am into this, since it only lasted a few weeks. Still, i can't help but feel a little betrayed. I had somewhat expressed how I felt about this guy, and I had heard that he felt the same way. So, naturally I am thinking things could actually work out for me, for once, but oh no. I'm new to this whole Dating Game, as I refer to it, so maybe I just played wrong, maybe my turn was over and I was too blind to see it. Who knows......I just wish that I could have gotten a simple explanation or warning, something telling me that he was thinking about getting back with her. I think i made it clear, as to how I felt, I mean I don't go around giving everyone massages and what not. Apparently, I wasn't clear enough though.

Maybe she's just better than me. 

I feel like I am back where I was a few years ago. I think of myself as a pretty confident person, except I feel about an inch tall right now. i feel like a fool for thinking that things might work out just this once. I feel like I was just a joke to him and all of his friends. I don't feel like I can trust anyone, as i feel betrayed by my friend whom I felt might actually help me in this situation. My confidence is gone. I feel like a nobody. No one will ever like me and I am destined to be alone. I'm pretty enough, smart enough, or funny enough....

And then there is that part of me that feels like I was just taken advantage of because a lot of people look at me as a naive person, or just the fact that I am nice is cause enough to walk all over me. Or maybe I was just used to make her jealous. I don't know. 

As much as I don't want it to bother me, it does...

So here's hoping that there is someone out there for me and that I find him soon."

It was so much fun, I was singing and dancing the night away. I haven't had that much fun in a while and it's strange to think that I had that much fun by myself....I mean I was with my mom and Carlos but I was there without any friends. I so wish that they could have gone. 

Then, after the concert I went to XS. That was fun but I got so tired super fast. I mean HELLO....3 hrs at a concert standing and then off to the club wow, I had no energy left last night it was all gone, and my throat hurt SO bad....lol but still it was a good night even though some ppl bailed on us...their loss. 

I love my friends to death but last night they bummed me out, there I was having an awesome night, just a lil sad that I was at the club alone but still doing good....having fun...but did they let me be....OH NO....they had good intentions but it still bummed me out. THey tried to get me to go talk to go up to guys, but thats not my style and then they even went and brought me a guy to dance with. Now that made me sad instead of happy bc I felt that I wasnt good enough to get a guy on my own. OH well, I'm over it. Its just something I have to live with...

So, what's going on in the world or Samantha...hmm....well I'm really hoping to get a bid to pledge Delta Zeta...That would seriously make my year! Some might think I am only wanting to pledge DZ b/c it's DU's sister sorority,and I guess you could say I have some ""history"" with at least one of those guys, but actually, that has NOTHING to do with it. The girls are so great and are So friendly, and a sorority is one of the fastest ways to meet tons of ppl. I've already met SOOO many ppl just hanging out with the girls at lunch. I went bowling with all the Greeks last weekend and had a total blast...it's so cool haw everyone hangs out and gets along. When I am with the DZ's I feel like I have a place I belong. It just feels right to me, I only hope that they come up with the same feeling.

There is also a new guy that has sparked my interest.....he is so gorgeous! His name is Juan, and he's a Phi Kap....at least I think he became a brother....anyways....he is a total sweetheart and an incredibly beautiful guy. Believe me, if you saw him, you would now what I am talking about...perfest body and such a cute smile! AH! I can't wait to see him again, I saw him Tues, and walked him to class....it was the first time i really got to hang out with him one-on-one....and when I left him, I felt like I was walking on air. Just thinking about him makes me happy...(I sound like such a loser)...but no one has made me happy like that since....Robert, but I guess we will just see what happens, so wish me luck.

School, is there, it's the whole reason I am having these thigns happen to me. Who would have thought that I would find a place where I feel like i fit in at PANAM....go figure! My classes are alright....EDCI sucks and I want to shoot myself, but other than that it's just a BUNCH of reading, and it rakes forever to get it done, but I'm working on it....hopefully this semester will calm down and I eill stop feeling like I am going 150mph. It's school, work, home...everyday....no time to really just chil...I need to find some extra hous in the day somewhere.....if onyl I lived in Edinburg, that wiould give me about 2 extra hous...maybe next semester...HOPEFULLY next semester....

OK, well there is your quick update b/c I know you were just DYING to know whats going on over here....lol"

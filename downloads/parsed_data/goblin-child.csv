"event","water.
i like to drink it.
i don't really like to be in it though.
most of my bath times have been rather traumatic/dramatic things.
but such is life for a young conquerer.
but something new has begun.
bathing with the she-demon.
it's happened twice so far.
at first it was somewhat unnerving.
the second time almost amusing.
i splash my mighty little fist and they get all a twitter.
the third is going to happen very soon i'm told.
let us see what happens."

my plan is well on it's way.
i've been using the laugh on the troll and she-demon for a couple of weeks now.
(the troll and she-demon being <lj user=eegare> and <lj user=bloody_princess> )
they love it.
it makes them so happy.
they are very good minions.
and it's wonderful when my plan also rewards them.
it makes it all so easy.
and today i nearly rolled over.
the troll was exstatic.
and the she-demon was upset she missed it.
i waited until she left the house.
and then i refused to show her.

i'm so evil.
but i'm so cute too.

when i rule the world we'll have to have two or three a year.
all the people and all the food.
i really wish i had teeth.
especially since i went to two of these dinner things.
one at the She-Demon's friends house.
uncle bentley cooked and uncle john was there and auntie fran.
uncle cain was kind neat even if he didn't have much of a clue.
his girlfriend, jo-lyen, i like very much though.
when i rule and have my harem, she will be one of my girls.
it was wonderful, i was cuddled and cooed at by so many people.

and then, the next day, we went to my pop's house.
that was even nicer.
i was cuddled and cooed at again.
but this time there was toys !!!
and a four legged furry thing that licked my face all over.
and more of that food stuff.
i can't wait to try it.
even though i really like this not having to feed myself thing.
and after the big people ate more showed up.
these ones were really great.
cooed, cuddled, kissed and made to laugh.
it was awsome !!!
except for all of them caling me sasquatch.
 
  note to self: find out what a sasquatch is."

They expect me to learn to speak, when so many languages are being spoken around me?  Silly silly people.

Some nurse took me last night and hurt my foot.  Note to self, kill her when I rule the world.  Better idea, kill all nurses who hurt babies.

Another person stuck stuff in my ears that made a real nice sound.... she had to come back many times.... something about too much mucus in my ears still.  Thats what she thinks, I just wanted to hear that sound more.

More feeding by the She-Demon, more abusing the dumb Troll's protectiveness.  Got him to carry me around the hospital by pretending to cry.

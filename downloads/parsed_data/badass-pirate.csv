2. <U>Jay and Silent Bob</U>

These Two <b>have</b> to be one of my favourite. Specially Jay... is he <i>really</i> heterosexual? I fear we will never know.

3. <U>Batman and Robin</U>

I don't care what you people say, that they were actually secretly bum-fucking or whatever. They were not. So shut up.

8. <U>Dante and Randal</U>

They are legendary. Maybe <i>almost</i> as much so as Jay and Silent Bob.

"event","Hi.
Well i am back from Canada, back to this shitty place. I tried soooo hard to stay and even wouldn't hand the woman my passport...i tried to lose it too, seeing as i am a canadian citizen if i had been 18 i could of just walked out and stayed..but nooooooo...GRRR! I h8 wales, mostly coz the people r all grumpy and unfriendly and my school is the worst in the world. Canada is so much better i swear. Okay I am gonna stop talking now coz i'm all alone and upset and i am planning on runnng away so they realise how much i actually hate this place and move..i wish.

<H3>Things Monique should see</H3>
1. Eurotrip (of you haven't)
2. Deuce Bigalow (both movies)
3. Dukes of Hazzard
4. Wedding Crashers (if you haven't to all of these really lol)
5. Old School
6. Family Guy Movie
7. Garden State (i finally got my friend back from seeing cinderella story haha she hated this movie, it has a random ending and is pretty weird but entertaining)

I have a new favourite song..either ""scotty doesn't know"" from the greatest movie ever Eurotrip, i laughed so hard in that, OR All American Rejects ""Dirty Little Secret"" its amazing and is on the Deuce Bigalow European Gigalo soundtrack, well it should be coz it played it at the beginning, that a great movie btw.

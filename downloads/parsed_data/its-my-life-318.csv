"event","Ok, so I haven't been on here in forever. And so much has happened, and most of it was terrible. Why is everyone going haywire? I mean honestly, people should be happy. This school year is coming to an end, and then summer vacation for the next two months. But why are people acting all ... weird?

[35] Steve invited himself to go with me and people to the carnival at the Southgate Plaza

[68] Back in March, Jackie didn't invite me to her birthday

This break has been amazing so far. It's exactly what I needed to make myself a little happier. Now if only I could get a boyfriend...

Carissa, sorry I couldn't do anything with you today. If it makes you feel any better, I didn't do anything with anyone. I'll make it up to you. You, me, and Sarah will have a you me and Sarah day sometime soon...lol don't ask I'm tired...

Jared... How could you forget what I got mad at you about? I'm not that mad, but still, it bothers me.

Nate, Friday morning's going to be awesome!!! I just hope it will finally work out...

Well, I g2g now. It's about 1:00 and time to call Nate and Jared. Bye!!

"event","Wow. Saturday was amazing. I went to Nate's house to hang out with him and Tilden. Then Jared came over after like maybe two hours. We hung out in his basement for a little while. We were all wrestling and fighting. It was fun. Then we watched Saw. It was stupid. The ending sucked. I didn't like it. We went back down in Nate's basement and hung out again, started fighting with each other. We ended up going to the movies to see Hitch, which turned out to be better than I expected. Nate fell asleep again. As usual. He fell asleep during Saw too... yea. I dno. Today was boring. But Nate and I talked on the phone pretty much all day. But I have to go now. Bye.

It's all her fault really... but anyways, Kristen, Phil, all of you who are going... have fun. And Kristen... if they do lock you in the bathroom, then they're obviously not good friends to you. It's your choice whether you want to be friends with her or not. Not anyone else's. And that thing the other day... with Maria or whoever?? ""Becky's gonna kick your ass cuz you didn't put her name one the calender. She just put it up there..."" Yea... what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Like Becky could really kick your ass. Fine. Let her get mad. I really could care less. Ugh! Hopefully they'll just drop this after the Florida trip and just let you be. I don't really know what else to say for now. Oh yea... Jared, I will wake you up on Saturday morning. You better believe it!!</font>

"event","I stayed home from school today. I'm so sorry Kristen. I would have helped you sneak into dentention but I honestly couldn't even sit up earlier. My mom thinks I'm having kidney problems... great. First she's talking about a tumor and now this... I mean, what the fuck is up with everyone? I can't stand this. Life sucks. Sometimes I just want to die, you know what I mean? Knowing that my parents are mad at me, my sisters could care less if I was living or not, and the only people in my family who care about me are my Aunt Julie and Aunt Jill... What is this world coming to? I can't even talk to my mom anymore without her getting mad at me about something... my parents both think I'm sadist because I don't believe in God... Why should I? There's no proof he exists. There are historical documents of Jesus and all... but I think that this Jesus just claimed to be the 'son of god' and back then people started to believe him. And now, look at what he's created. There are so many churches out there and all they want is your money. I swear it's like a cult. Why do people believe in this kind of thing? I don't get it... But I really want to know why my parents are making this such a big fucking deal. It's my choice to believe in God or not. Not theirs. That's why my dad flipped out on me on Monday night. I told him that I wasn't going to make my confirmation. My mom knew about this already, and all she said to me was ""Your grandmother's not gonna be very happy when she hears that."" But my dad... 
Dad: ""What makes you think that?""
Me: ""It's my choice whether I make confirmation or not!""
Dad: ""No it's not! As long as you live under this roof, you follow our rules.""
Me: ""Yea, well you're not hte one who has to say you want to continue you faith in the Catholic church are you? All I have to do is say 'No, I don't want to make confirmation' and then I won't get confirmed.""
Dad: ""Well then maybe we should start going to church again.""
Me: ""If you do, I'm not going with you!""
Dad: ""Yeah, you better believe that you are!""
Me: ""Fine, then I'll find a way to get myself kicked out of the church.""
Dad: ""You do that and you'll be grounded until your 18.""
Me: ""Why are you trying to force me to believe in God? It's my decision. It seems like you're trying to change my mind for me, and it's not gonna happen!""
Dad: ""Just GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME! I DON'T WANT TO FUCKIN HEAR IT!!""
So I went up to my room and stayed there until it was time to go to religion class. Yea, he made me go. So I went. And in the car, he started again.
Dad: ""You know, what if you're wrong about this? What if there is a God? What happens to you then?""
Me: ""How should I know? It's not like I'm creating a religion here.""
Dad: ""But what happens to you if there really is a Heaven? Do you go to Hell?""
Me: ""I believe that when you die, that's it. You're no more. The end.""
Dad: ""BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU'RE WRONG?""
Me: ""I don't know, I'll find out when I die, won't I? Until then just stay out of this ok? I don't need your help to make this decision.""
Dad: ""You know, Einstein believed in God.""
Me: ""Well, I'm not Einstein.""
Dad: ""But doesn't that make you think? One of the smartest men in history-""
Me: ""But I'm not him! It doesn't matter to me what Einsteing thought or what you thought... It's what I think that matters here! You can't decide for me!""
Dad: ""THAT'S IT! JUST GET OUT OF THIS CAR! GET OUT!""
So I got out of the car and went to religion class. It's rediculous. I hate him. He's such a jackass. And last night I had a dream...more like a nightmare about him. I was sitting at the computer, and from where it is, I can see into the Family room where the TV is. My parents were in there arguing about something and the next thing I hear is my mom yelling at him, and it sounded like she was in pain. My mom was yelling, ""Jordan! Help!!"" and my dad said something like, ""Bitch, you know that ever since she was little she stayed out of our way when we were fighting!"" But I couldn't watch him kill my mother, so I started yelling at him, ""Back off of her asshole! Let her go!"" My mom was yelling ""Thank you"" and I just jumped on him without thinking. He threw me off and I hit the wall. I grabbed a spoon (they were eating dinner in there before they started fighting) and I threw it at his head as hard as I could. He threw my mom down to the ground, grabbed and knife and I started running. I ran out the front door, fell down the stairs flat on my face, got up and started running again, the whole time he was following me. He threw the knife at me and it hit me in the back. There was a police car comming. Then I woke up.
I don't know what else to say right now, so I'm gonna go.

So ""bah"" on you Jared... You know what I mean. Maybe Carissa and I should've just left you in the closet. That way we wouldn't have had to deal with you!! HaHa. You know I'm joking. At least, by now you should.
Kristen...I can't believe that you're leaving for Florida on Friday! I'm gonna miss you... well anyways have fun and do whatever you can to tick Mrs. Georger off. PLEASE!! lol You understand. By the way, I do know how to sneak out and back in even if they do put tape on the outside of the doors. I'll have to show you what I mean.
Nate...I'll ask her. Don't worry. My parents were out last night and when they got home my dad knocked my chair over so I fell and then he shut the computer down, if oyu wanted to know why I didn't respond. So I will do that for you. Don't worry.
Happy... I can't believe you thought I was a guy!! lol It's okay though, that's happened to me before. And what's with your fascination with old people?!? I mean wtf... lol
Tilden... Yea, hi!! I hope you didn't tell anyone. ANY OF IT!! Well, I thought I'd say something to you since I was saying something to everyone else. Dude, we have to hang out sometime next week. You're awesome...
Carissa... Happy V-Day!! ""Throw pillows suck!!"" lol You get the point. Hopefully this V-Day will be even better than last year's...
Sarah... You found a Valentine! Yay! Now I can stop asking my cats for you...lol
Amie... Even though things are kind of rough right now, I know that things will get better. I'm here for you, remember that. You can always call me. ""I'm only one call away..."" lol
Kerri... Happy V-Day!! We don't hang out as much as we should, but when we do, we have some awesome times. ""I'm a piggy!"" lol That whole day... awesome.
Yea... well Happy Valentine's Day everyone.</font>

I'll just be single the rest of my life... everytime I end up going out with someone, it always ends up the same. Either the guy likes another girl or he cheats on me. It sucks. I can only remember one time when I broke up with someone, and that was because it was just weird going out with them, we seemed like friends and only friends. But really, I wouldn't want to lose any of my friends if we were to go out and break up... that would just suck. This report card is horrible. My parents know and they're not too happy about it either. Who cares. Screw it all. Life sucks. Why go through it if the world is just gonna get sucked into the sun in a few billion years?? I don't know. But this is getting rediculous. So whatever. Love day is so soon....

Why can't anything work out the way it's supposed to? Why do the worst things happen to the best people? I don't know, but I don't like this. It's my life... why am I so sick of everything in it? Why isn't anything working out? Why can't things just work out for once?

Kristen... I need you now, more than ever. Just please, stick this out with me. I can't lose you. I love you way too much. There's just so much going on right now, I can hardly take it all in. I just want everyone to be happy. And I know that the world doesn't work that way, but I just wish it would. I love you so much. Don't ever change. I love you. bffe

Nate... I love you so much. You are one of my best friends. If I didn't have you in my life anymore, I'd die. I can't stand it when people hurt you. You don't deserve it (most of the time). But I love you and that's what matters to me. You. I care about you. You've been there for me, you've helped me through so much. But now I feel like I'm losing you, and believe me, I don't want to. I really really don't. I'm here for you whenever you need me. Call me if you need to talk to someone. Just please, don't do anything rash. Just sit and think for a minute. I know that if you're reading this, you probably don't really care, but I'm just letting you know that I do care. I care about you. I want you to be happy. I want you to be ok. I don't like it when you get this upset. I hate it. Why does this have to happen? I'd rather all this happened to me. It has before, but I don't like to see my friends hurt. I'd rather be the punching bag than see my friends get hurt. I stand up for my friends. I try as hard as I can to let them know I care. Nate, I'd jump in front of a car for you. I'd take a bullet for you. Life is too precious to just let go of it. You only live once, live it well and be happy. Don't live with the pain. Get rid of it. Forget about whatever makes you mad. Forget about everyone who ever hurt you. Just please, don't forget that I'm stuck here, soaking so much shit up, and I care about you. You're loved. You're my best friend and I don't want anything to happen to our friendship. No matter what, you will always hold a special place in my heart. I will always cherish the memories we have. Most of all, I will always love you. Just believe me when I tell you that I care about you and no matter what, you can always count on me to be there for you. I love you.   Your one of my best friends. And right now, I couldn't stand to lose another best friend. I just couldn't. I've been through so much this year so far...Just please, know that I care about you and I love you. There's not much more I can say...I just really hope you care about me as much as I care about you. I love you. bffe

Jared, There are some things in life that I just don't understand. Why people start things, I'll never know. There are just some stupid people out there who think they ""own"" everyone else. Well, they can't stomp on us. I'm always gonna be here for you, no matter what. I love you. bffe

Everything's falling apart...but why now? Why? WHy is this happening to me? I just want to die sometimes. I cry myself to sleep at night thinking about stuff... I can't take it anymore. And things are just accumulating... is it ever going to get any better?

"event","Well, here I am sitting in the public library. This keyboard is old... eww. It's like... yellow. And it's so loud when I type on it. Oh well. Too bad for the people around me. I think I see Chelsea over at the desk... yep. That's her. I've been so bored lately... no one seems to like to do anything anymore. I don't know if it's just me, but no one goes anywhere or hangs out anymore really. I mean, yea I know that we all have to deal with school, but even on the weekends I have been just sitting around on the phone or the computer and no one seems to want to get out of the house!! This is crazy. High School... well, what can I say about it? Most of the people suck. Some are ok though. The teachers... they suck too. I don't know why. THey just do. Except for Ms. Reed. She's awesome. But no one else seems to care if their students do well or not. That bothers me. Why don't they just care?? It's so stupid. Spanish tomorrow, Kristen. That means we get to finish watching Buscando a Nemo en espanol!! lol anenenenome... lol being single is ok, but just that. Only ok. Being with Cody was like being single. I never got to see him, he never wanted to do anything with me. Only his friends and that girl at Exposure. So really, I should have just stayed single. I could have had a reacord of over 1/3 of a year by now. I don't know why that matters exactly, and I guess it really shouldn't. But yea, oh well. I think I'm gonna try to wait for awhile again before I get another boyfriend. Cody only confused the hell out of me. And none of my other ex's seemed to matter to me as much as Cody Smith did. I don't know why he did, but he did. He actually was a good boyfriend until he decided he liked Amie. No offense to you Amie, I love you!! But it was his fault our relationship ended, and it did hurt me. I mean it really hurt me. Cody Majeski on the other hand... he didn't really hurt me that much. I knew he wanted to break up with me, I could just tell. So yea, he didn't really hurt me, he just pissed me off. I could mess him up so bad if I wanted to, but I just don't see the point in it. He obviously doesn't even want to still be my friend like he said he did. If he does want to be my friend, why hasn't he called?? Do I have to call him? Oh well. I don't need jerks like him in my life anyways. I really don't. All they do is cause pain. He didn't cause any pain yet, but he might have if I had no idea he was going to break up with me. I still don't see why Sarah or Heather didn't tell me right after they found out. I'm sure that Sarah never would have mentioned it if I didn't find out from Heather. Thank you Heather!! This is getting long and boring isn't it?? Well, I guess it doesn't really matter all that much because no one really reads this anyways, right?? So who do I like now?? I don't even know anymore. I really don't know. There's just a lot of confusion right now, and no one seems all that interesting to me anyways, so why bother with a boyfriend? I do want a boyfriend, but not just any guy. I want someone who will care about me, who won't hurt me, I want someone who will TELL ME THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I want someone who's sweet and considerate. I want a relationship, not a job or stress. All this stress is depressing me anyways. I haven't been really happy in a long time. I don't know why either. But I do know that I don't like it. And somehow, I'm going to fix it. Well, I should probably wrap this up. Bye!"

But hopefully Phil will be able to fix mine : ) Yesterday was hysterical... classic. I can't say anything more about it, but if you ask me, maybe I'll tell you. By the way... Thanks for your comment Kristen, and yes, I still do. Why do you ask though? I wonder... Well, anyways, things haven't been so bad. I mean, they aren't the best, but they're better than they were. I just wish people wouldn't lie anymore... that's the whole problem. if people didn't lie and backstab... things could be better. But hey,  what can you do when your friends want to lie to you and about you, backstab you, and whatever else they might do? There's nothing I can do about them. Nothing. That bothers me. If I could make them tell me the truth, I'd be so happy... why does everyone have to lie about everything?? It's 2005... wow, where did 2004 go? It went by fast. By the way everyone, I found out the goodbye song to Bear in the Big Blue House!!"

Cody, if you're reading this (but I highly doubt you are...) you really screwed up. I mean it. You don't know who you're messing with, do you? If I wanted to, I could male your life hell. It wouldn't be that hard. And by the way, thank you so much for leaving out bits of the truth. That really makes me feel good. Really? No! i can't stand it when people do that. But hey, if that's the way you want to be and treat people, go right ahead. I'm just gonna forget about you. That's all. It won't be very easy, and I know that. But it's the only way you'll see....

And if anyone can guess who I like now, post a comment. I want to see who you all think I like. Only one person knows, and i'm not saying who. She might have forgotten by now though...

I can't believe all those times you lied to me, and you cheated on me! How could you do that? How?! I'm mad. I really am. I just wish you had told me the truth. I would have understood... but no, you went to my friends before me. And I'm sorry to hear that. I thought I could trust you. I guess you wanted to break up. But I hear you do care about me and that's why you didn't tell me... but I WANTED YOU TO TELL ME!! That's all I wanted - THE TRUTH. That's all I needed. So how long were we living that lie? If you cared so much, why didn't you just say something when I asked you? Why? I wanted to know the truth. I didn't even hear it from you. I wish I did. I wish it didn't have to be this way. But I can't believe that it happened. If you had only given me the truth...

Well, I'm single now. Yay me I guess. Might as well try to be happy about it since I'm gonna have to deal with it for awhile now.


I know that this will break me
I know that this might make me cry
You gotta say what's on your mind, on your mind
I know that this will hurt me
And break my heart and soul inside
But I don't wanna live this lie
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me
~~The Truth  -  Good Charlotte~~


Cody, all I wanted was the truth. Why couldn't you just give it to me? Why did you lie? Why did you make me cry? Why did you hurt me? It's not my fault. It's yours. You are the reason I'm suffering here... You. Not me, you. I love you to death, but this makes me wonder why. I told you that all you had to do was give me the truth. And you couldn't even do that! I guess we really were living a lie...

You say you care.
Heather says you care.
Sarah says you care.
Everyone says you care.
But do you really mean it?
Did you ever?
I don't know...

It's my life... I don't want to live it in lies.
It's my life... I want to live it right.
It's my life... I want you in it.
It's my life... Don't mess with it!!

Comments are welcome on this, it's really getting to me. Tell me what I should do. What's going on. This whole thing is messed up and crazy. I don't like it. I hate it. I don't want to live it anymore...

My life's a lie...
And you don't care...
You left me here...
To do what??

I'm sick of this life
I'm sick of the pain
I'm sick of being caught
Up in your game
I'm sick of the lies
What happened to you
I'm sick of this shit
I only wanted the truth

Thanks so much to all my friends who actually TELL THE TRUTH.

Comments are welcome here. I just want the truth.

"event","<font face=""Comic Sans"" color=""Aqua"" size=3>Just got home a little while ago... I was at a Christmas party at my Grandpa's house. The third and final one for the year. It was kind of boring though.

I didn't talk to *him* today. Or actually, yesterday when you think about it.

Since today it the 27th, yay! One month for me and Cody! We made it this far baby, let's keep it going. I love you so much. You really don't understand how much I care about you, and I don't want to lose you. But as long as you're in my life, I'm happy.

I didn't get the chance to talk to Kristen today, either. So I guess I'll call her tomorrow to see if she can do something. My dad is staying home from work, so I don't have to watch my sisters! It's a miracle, I swear, but he wanted to stay home. You know, have a longer vacation.

I hope New Years 2005 will be as fun as 2004 ... Walking around outside aimlessly at 11:00, looking for Orion's Belt (the constellation), throwing monkeys everywhere (me and Nate, lol) ... it was just the best ever (taking out Jess that is). Anyways, I hope everything turns out ok...

OMFG he's online... he better not talk to me when I sign onto AOL... OMFG again! He just sent me an email!! Those of you who want to know who I mean in any of these, just ask me, and I'll probably tell you. GrRrRr !i!

Well, there's not much else to say. So I'll leave you with a question:

Why is High School so full of drama? Seriously, I feel like I'm in one of those reality TV shows or movies. It sucks!! Leave a comment on this please!! Help me out! Any suggestions??</font>

"event","<font face=""Comic Sans"" color=""33FFCC"" size=2>OK, so here it goes. What's goin on right now? I don't know. Yesterday sucked. It just did, ok? Ok. At least you understand me. Or do you? Do I even know you? Who is reading this? Why do you care? Oh, fine. Go ahead. Read about my boring pathetic life. It's your choice whether you want to read it or not. So let's see... New Years isn't what *he* thought it was going to be. Neither is *his* Christmas present. Why did he think that? I don't know. But whatever. Like I always say, whatever happens happens. Right? I hope so. I don't get things right now. They aren't exactly clear to me. Oh well. I'll get through this and hopefully it will all work out in the end...

I miss him. I can't stand this! He's the only person who really understands me and helps me in these situations other than Kristen. I need him. I'd do almost anything. Seriously, I would.

I hate High School. Not the school itself, but the people in it and what's happening in our lives now that we are in it. I didn't think that going to High School would affect me this much. But it did. So here I am, just wondering what college will be like... If it brings more drama like this, I think I might just forget about it. Hopefully when I get out of this school, this will be better. Or, at least I could get out of this phase and move on with my life. I'm trying. But this isn't even affecting her this bad...or at all it seems. This is insanity - how can she just not care? How could anyone? i know that no matter what, I couldn't not care about something like this. I have to care. That's what I do. All the time. It's good in some cases, but in cases like this one, it's no use and I wish I didn't care so much, or at all. But if I didn't care, I'd be just like her, and that's definately not something that I want to be. So what do I do? I forget her, slowly... piece by piece. It might take awhile, but still, I think I'm finally letting her go... If she wants to, I'll let her. She'll realize she's the one that made the mistake. Then she'll understand the pain and effort it takes...

Really though, some things are ok. But then again, a lot of things aren't ok either. I'm sticking through it all - no repeats of last year. I'm trying so hard, and believe me, this time, it really is hard. A lot of people don't even go through this, but since I am, I'm going to try to over come it. And I will. I know I will.

Kristen - I really admire your strength. Even in the worst situations, you manage to pull through help yourself. You have been there for me through so much of this f*n S*t and I really really want to thank you for that. You're always so kind and caring, and I just love you to death. You are my best friend. I'm always here for you if you need me. We'll keep adding to our memories one day at a time... taking time to enjoy everything there is to life, and stick together through all of it. ~*~BFFE~*~

I can't believe that Christmas is in two days. Really, I mean, two days! I'm just not in the spirit this year. I wasn't really last year either. Christmas isn't exactly my holiday. I like New Years and 3/18 day a lot better (lol, if you get it).

Well, I'm kind of tired, so I think I'm going to head to my room where I can wrap presents, write down a few things that are on my mind (just like I do on here), and then go to sleep, because we all know I need it. Sleep is my temporary escape from reality, a few hours away from everything that's going on. And dreams... I want a lot of mine to come true, and if they can't, I might as well imagine them at night when I can't do anything else. So goodnight everyone. Or should I say good morning?

"event","Ok, one problem fixed. Not saying which one, but those of you I told this to you should know what I mean.

Yesterday was pretty cool. I went to the mall with Cody, Jared, and Becky. Christmas is coming soon... the dollar tree is amazing!! Everyone will know why soon enough... lol

Other than that, things suck. I can't stand it. I'm sick of school, I'm sick of all this f*n bullshit. I can't take any more of it. There aren't many things I care about right now... I'm just gonna let my grades drop. I really don't care anymore! I just don't! I'm gonna forget about everyone who has hurt me, everyone who has ever left a mark in me, everyone I ever cared about who just turned into a BITCH! Lately, everything is so fucked up and I can't fuckin stand it anymore. I really can't. I just want all the drama to end. And some of the BITCHES aren't doing anything to help either. This is so screwed up. I can't fucking believe it! Why can't things just work out for me ever? I can't stand it! High School sucks! The only things in High School that matter to me are:

Kristen
Phil
Steph
Becky
Richelle
Noelle
Study Hall
S******* C******

I don't really know of anything else ...

Middle School was less complicated. It was easier. It seems like things are mounting up on me. When will it all let go? When? Hello? You're not answering me! Will someone just give me a sign? Can someone please just give me some answers? Is anyone there? Is anyone listening? NO! Why would anyone be? No one cares. They shouldn't either. There's no point in it.

Kristen -- you've been there for me through all of this. It's nice to know someone cares. Thanks. I love you! Shizzlin Weasel Diesel

Cody -- I Love you so much. Thanks for being there for me ... Tiffany/Shaneyney/cousin/brother

<marquee><font face=""Comic Sans"" color=""Yellow-Green"">~I Love Cody~</font></marquee>

Peace everyone.

"event","Everything is confusing. I don't seem to understand it all. Tonight is going to be very boring... I can't go out anywhere because I'm stuck at home watching my sisters while my parents go out, and no one else will be home either. Practically everyone I know is going to the Kissmasbash. There aren't really any good bands playing there, but still, I won't be able to talk to anyone while I'm stuck home because no one will be home! I stayed home sick today again. I slept 18 hours from 6:00 last night until 6:00 this morning when my dad made me take a shower, so that was twelve, went back to sleep at 7:00 and woke up at 1:47. That's a long time... but I don't think I'm sick anymore, which is a good thing. This is crazy though. My mom better let me go somewhere this weekend. I'm getting so sick of cleaning the house and remodeling it every chance my parents get. I could really careless what the kitchen looks like right now. But still, my mom insists on making it look more like this house is ours. We only moved in here a month and a half ago, but she thinks that the whole house should look like it has always been ours. I still haven't emailed Chris back. I'm going to as soon as I'm done with this entry though. The email I'm sending him isn't very nice, but at least it will hopefully finally get him to unerstand that I can't stand him. Jess's birthday is next Thursday... I'm deciding whether I should give her the box or not. I think should. It would definately put her on a guilt trip, and then when she'd try to be my friend again, I could tell her off for everything she's done already. But then again, I'm still deciding. Anyways, I think that's all I have to say for now. I Love Cody! Well, I might get to add something later. Bye!

There are more things I want to add today, but I'm not sure if I will get around to them. So for now:

I Love Cody
I Love Kristen - I'm here for you.

Waiting, for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting
Liberate your mind
You motherfucker, you're so narrow-minded
So narrow-minded
Liberate your mind
Now motherfucker, will you liberate your mind
This time

Disturbed, Liberate

That's all I have time for now. I'll try to add more later."

"event","I don't know anymore. Life is messed up. Everything is going out of control. I can't stand it. Jess is forgetting. How could she?? I don't know, but it's bothering the hell out of me. Why? WHY??? I don't understand it. And now Chris wants me back as a friend. I can't believe it! He understands that I was the reason he got friends. Well, he wants me to be his friend again so he can have friends. I don't care. I'm not gonna just forget.

Here's the first email he sent me:

i miss u im changeg i want u back all of you jess u kerry amy nate mike explisl kristion i konw i scrrod up and i what things to go back the way they were. im sorry please forgive me chris ferraro


Then I wrote back to him:

 
Chris,
  I don't want to take you back as a friend. Yes, you screwed up. But you screwed up so many times before, and I just let them go. I was being nice. I thought I was doing the right thing. And I was. I was being forgiving. I was just trying to make someone else happy like a usually do, but honestly, Chris, look where it got me. I don't want to accept you back into my life, I think that that would be a big mistake. We've tried in the past, and it just hasn't worked out. The last time though, yo screwed up so bad to the point where I hated you. Time has let me stop hating you, I think that hating people is wrong. But I still remember everything you have ever done to me, all those times you hurt me. But now that I look back on it, I can't believe I was so stupid. I tried, Chris, I really did. And it didn't get me anywhere, did it? All I got was another problem to solve, another issue to go through, another part of my life to look back on and ask myself, ""why did I do that?"" I know why: I'm a forgiving person. But you have to realize that sometimes, things that some people do can't be forgiven. Sometimes, people hurt. People cry. People do some really stupid things. But we can't change the past, and if I could, I wouldn't. We went through a lot in a short amount of time, yea, but still, my life is complicated enough as it is now without you in it everyday, and I'd like to keep things going the way I have them. And that means that I'm not going to just forgive you anymore, I'm done with that. You have showed me that you can't be trusted. I don't know why you would think I would just forgive you and take you back as a friend or whatever you're looking for, but I'm not only speaking for myself, I'm also speaking for Kristen, Jared, Amie, Kerri, and Nate who also do not want you back as a friend. You can ask all of them. I'm not sure about Mike and Jess..... I thought you were friends with Jess. Why would you e-mail me? Why me? Why do you always say ""hi"" to me if you know that I'm not going to respond? Why, why, why, why, why? I don't really know.. write back to me if you want to. Bye.

Can you believe that? Most of you don't know about the basement thing. Or the BUrger King thing. I'm not going to explain them though... just know that he knocked me out before and I have these memories that I really don't want to have. And Jess... Well, what is there to say. She's just.. ahh, I don't know."

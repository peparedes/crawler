of me dissolve and I become
a wish to assimilate the world, including
you, if possible through the skin

I would not consume
you or ever
finish, you would still be there

Unfortunately I don't have leaves.
Instead I have eyes
and teeth and other non-green
things which rule out osmosis.

"event","You can't unwrite letters. &nbsp;I scroll down this page and see love letters written by a version of myself that is no more than shedded skin on the side of the highway. &nbsp;I am ashamed of them, for they are really love letters to myself, to my ability with words, to a romanticized notion of what love is, what my love for Don&nbsp;was, and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are permanent, though, they cannot be destroyed even if I burn them, and I do not think&nbsp;I want to burn them.

I do not write love letters, now.&nbsp; I wrote them for Ian, and for Don, in the twilight of our romances, when&nbsp;I was grasping for some kind of meaning, some way to feel fulfilled in a situation that is inherently incapable of fulfilling me. &nbsp;Now, I want to write love letters to myself. &nbsp;She is the one who needs them, the one who should be benefitting from my natural talents. &nbsp;But I starve her for affection and she pours herself, like water, into the arms of men, their methods of praising and caring - she is weak or strong or cuddly or standoffish, she is the shape that expands to fit the amount of affection available to her - solid, slippery, full, thin, she is the same shape as what is available to her.

And there are ways that another human being cannot give her affection, and ways men cannot give her affection, she does not know how to hold herself, hold herself up into one shape, her shape. &nbsp;Be like water, be like water, but you'll seep into floorboards, carpets, you will become a mire and be walked upon, where there is no dignity even if there is an enlightening view."

"event","Once when I was growing up, I took a trip to the beach with a girl who lived in my neighborhood.&nbsp; I did not know her very well, but the trip sounded like fun so I decided to go along.&nbsp; Near the beach was a forested area and in that area of the forest was a creek full of tadpoles.&nbsp; Being quite young and still amazed at the variety of life on earth, I began collecting them to take home.&nbsp; I got them back to my house safely and my mother helped me set up a fishbowl habitat for them.

I took them into school once a few of them had started growing legs.&nbsp; I was the hit of first grade with those little guys, and although I thought they were astounding, I did not name them.&nbsp; They were just, collectively, &quot;the tadpoles,&quot; and even though I would sit and watch them individually move about, I never thought to actually name them.

At some point, at my brother's insistence I'm sure, I decided to name them.&nbsp; At which point they began to die off.&nbsp; At the moment, they are still in a shoebox buried in my mother's yard, their names forgotten and interred with their little leg bones.

===============

There was a night when my mother could hear a strange yipping come from under the house.&nbsp; She urged my father to investigate and when he did he discovered the runt of a neighborhood cat's litter.&nbsp; He pulled it out from under the house and, as a family, we cleaned it up and took it to the vet.&nbsp; He was a two week old kitten, basically useless, but we were told he might be fine if we kept him warm and fed him.&nbsp; All day long my brother and I played with this kitten that we knew was going to be ours.&nbsp; We played with him for hours and hours and only at bedtime did my mother care to suggest we find a name for him.&nbsp; We argued a bit and decided upon &quot;Buster.&quot;&nbsp; When we woke up the next morning, he had died.&nbsp; His bones are somewhere near those of the tadpoles, and it still pains me to remember his name.

===============

Language is perhaps the most useful tool of society as it exists today.&nbsp; Each combination of letters represents an abstraction, and arbitrarily stirs up emotions and ideas in us.&nbsp; Words are self-contained little bubbles, in theory.&nbsp; You can find a definitive list of other words that any given word &quot;means.&quot;&nbsp; However, they say language evolves, it is alive.&nbsp; Each person who encounters a given word infuses it with the entirety of their experience.&nbsp; And so, words from hundreds of years ago can reach us now and affect us, or serve as a catalyst for individuals to allow themselves to affect . . . themselves.&nbsp; You see, the dictionary is a guidebook, but we all decide for ourselves what firsthand experience qualifies as &quot;pain&quot; or &quot;joy.&quot;&nbsp; Webster provides the borders, but each of us draws our own personal map.

We each decide when an experience is a &quot;thing,&quot; and then consequently that that &quot;thing&quot; requires a name.&nbsp; The list of available names for any given experience is chosen from a dictionary.&nbsp; We must take the broadest possible terminology and apply it to our most specific and personal encounters with the world.&nbsp; We have to borrow the &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;joy&quot; that are used indiscriminately in advertisements and as jokes and as threats by the population at large, and we have to somehow find space for our own unique pains and joys.

Like cramming -yet another- person onto a rush hour MUNI train, we make the people in our lives and the experiences in our souls uncomfortable and crowded by forcing them to all share horrendously vague terms being simultaneously used by people we hate to describe experiences we cannot understand.

I take the people I know and the things I feel and I let them wait for an empty train car.&nbsp; They ride alone, they are silent, but it is they, and they alone, who fill up the space.&nbsp; Nothing crowds or crushes them, no one pollutes their air space.&nbsp; They remain pure and calm and unnamed."

"event","I endured some small collision when we last made love and there is an oval bruise ripening on my anterior right shoulder.&nbsp; It is the color of drying watercolors against my skin: an aqueous splash of purple with darkened pinprick spots that bloomed into an elliptical tan and is wilting to a yellowish egg, the purplish spots now collected along the bottom.&nbsp; It is small, the size of a thumbprint, I would imagine.&nbsp; Well, your thumbprint - your hands and fingers are my size, feminine, and soft.

If I knew for certain that your thumb grabbing my shoulder caused this mark, that has lived almost a week on its own, I would feel compelled to bludgeon the area again, stamping the same broken blood vessel and squeezing out more colors.&nbsp; I would want to see the visible proof of you, longer.

Yet, for all I know, I incurred this injury stepping into a doorframe, or leaning a funny way against a subway pole on the way to meet you.

I strode down the street: my outfit and attitude for making love one of coy confidence, and yours of boyish elusion.&nbsp; As I clip-clopped toward you, our eyes caught each other and you ducked behind a concrete pillar, as though your thirty year-old frame could ever move as quickly as your mind, your body could possibly escape my gaze.&nbsp; And my gait gained purpose, I became matronly, intentioned, and aggressive.&nbsp; Could I have bruised myself?

You called me baby, begged me to give myself joy, held my hair, kissed my nose.&nbsp; You entered me suddenly, and all at once, and we struggled.&nbsp; I cannot penetrate, so I would merely deny, repel, reject, and elicit your renewed effort.&nbsp; But at what point did you touch my shoulder?&nbsp; I on top, you behind, when?

Afterwards, I massaged your back with my feet, skin on skin, and I looked down at the nape of your neck.

You read to me and I fell asleep watching the bridge peekaboo with me from across your deck, through the curtains.&nbsp; I read to you and you fell asleep as I struggled to regain the enunciation talents of my adolescence.&nbsp; I awoke to your voice, soft, at the doorway.

Did you bite me?&nbsp; Let's say you bit me as you buried your face into my shoulder, exclaiming love.&nbsp; That's the ticket.

I know you cannot love me as I love you - you weren't built for this strange and glorious pain.&nbsp; We, too, will ripen and wilt and it will be as natural as the next thing despite all the various colors that fill our shape.&nbsp; I wish always to return to the soil, to smooth consistent skin.&nbsp; But at this moment, anticipating our next contact, anxious because you are leaving in merely a week, I would like to leave the littlest vein open, to keep the tiniest fissure intact, so that I might bleed for you in the way most appropriate to us: slowly, subtly, painfully, beautifully, but always beneath the surface."

I had just arrived at work when I heard cars pulling into the driveway.&nbsp; I put down my briefcase and pulled back the curtains of the upstairs window in order to see a large shiny black pick up truck loaded with people.&nbsp; I only thought I knew one person, a man, at first.&nbsp; As the crowd grew, I recognized more people in it.&nbsp; They were all nostalgically familiar, but I'd no idea who they actually were.&nbsp; I was surrounded by a family of strangers.&nbsp; I wanted badly to leave work, but there was too much to do.&nbsp; I cracked the window open and watched as one of them pulled out a boombox.&nbsp; I went downstairs.&nbsp; A woman explained to me that this was their annual ritual, to play a particular Jethro Tull song at top volume in the early hours of the morning.&nbsp; It seemed like a strange ritual, but I figured it would make more sense if I knew which song they were going to play.&nbsp; I forgot about work for the moment and sat down to listen to the song, so I could identify it and solve the puzzle of this tradition, and why it would include me.&nbsp; The first few notes played and then
 
There was a man leaning over me, in very sharp focus.&nbsp; He was clean-shaven, wearing a dark coat that looked new and stylish.&nbsp; He smiled warmly, looked me right in the eyes, and spoke to me.&nbsp; I don't remember what he said, only that he was saying goodbye.&nbsp; I didn't feel sad.&nbsp; I wanted to know which Jethro Tull song was playing.&nbsp; Everything felt like a mystery, the vague yet intimate crowd suddenly shrinking to one sharply defined man, tenderly kissing me on his way out the door.&nbsp; I was suddenly very aware of my warmth, and of darkness.&nbsp; I forgot about the song.&nbsp; The room fell out from under me as this man alighted on my bed, for a moment, and then
 
I am not sure where I was.&nbsp; There were calm waves.&nbsp; I couldn't hear anything except a relentless rush of water pulsating through air.&nbsp; For a moment, I thought it was music, but it was just the sounds of nature.&nbsp; I existed on a plane that was out-of-body.&nbsp; I organized, I strengthened, I encouraged, I enjoyed.&nbsp; I do not know what, though.&nbsp; Some void, some place so solely mine that it had no exposition.&nbsp; It was a peaceful drift.&nbsp; It was a place I could have never been if it weren't for the man who alighted on my bed, who shattered the insane puzzle of my previous life - the one full of people, but not one who knew me - and replaced it with an aimless sun-warmed float toward a meaningful morning."

"event","There's no one like a therapist,
to listen calmly when you are pissed,
to explain the logic you may have missed,
to forgive the froth and address the gist.

You sometimes need a professional,
to expose your worries as banal,
to remind you to walk when you want to crawl,
to be a mirror in which you're big, not small.

So, if you have problems you need to fix,
eschew the simple, and choose elaborate tricks,
don't lean on drugs or get stuck on sex:
a CPC will take your shit and cash your checks."

"event","Writing my poems is like shaving my legs:

I have known I should do it for days, I have taken tweezers to the particularly dark ones
and long ones, and one growing in pairs or triads,
or any that threaten to grow backwards or any
that just . . . annoy me.

I try to force some out with my fingernails, but
they resist, they leave marks,
they are failures that may not ever heal.

And so it is a rough patch left - the ones that grew in
easy and modest, the ones I barely knew were there,
but now I see them and should prune them.

This takes preparation - relaxation or, rather,
exhaustion by means of steaming wetnesses,
slow openings and vulnerabilities met
with sharpened blades.

I have never used cream, but never had
a problem bleeding, either.

When I'm done, the wetness gone,
I wash what's left off the sides and swirling
drown the drain,

where they belong."

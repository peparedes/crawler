"event","Well, The TCBY Livejournal will have to be no more, because neither Nathan nor I will be working at TCBY after Sunday (he quit a long time ago, but my last day is this Sunday).  I really have no idea why I'm writing this, nor do I have an idea as to what I'm going to do with this spare livejournal now.  It's not like I actually have stuff that I don't write about in the other livejournal.

Gah, and it's not like I'll have anything nearly as interesting to put in this journal from any other place that I work.

I'll have to think of something to do with this thing.  First thing, though, will be to change the color stuff.
But not the icon, because that's just too great."

"event","This is the first update in forever...since Feb.5.  I'm mostly updating to say that Nathan turned his 2-weeks' notice in the other day, and I'm going to probably Tuesday.  But this doesn't spell the end for the livejournal here,  rather...a reformation.  Revolution!  

Anyway, I'll probably change the layout and stuff due to it not being TCBY anymore.  Nathan, I believe, will be working with his dad, and I'm pretty sure to get the job at Ross.  I don't know exactly what's going to happen to the journal, but whenever it does happen it will!

Sooo....yeaaa, that's really all there.

But I'm posting tonight.

First, some pictures.
Nathan and his brother got some crazy baggage of popcorn proportions.

Now then.

It rained that night, so Nathan posed in the rain.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dc24b3127cceb852a83496e90000001610"">
He looks like a floating torso!

Now, we took out the trash during the rain.  This made our hair wet, and thusly...sculptable.

Not the best hair sculptures.  Not very innovative, etc.  Just kind of...average.
But look!  There's MORE.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dc24b3127cceb852a81717fa0000001610"">
Oh, oh my...HMMMMM would be the caption for this one.

And now for the grandest of the many.

Dr. Seuss?

YES.

But also, Nathan (and now the internet itself) will learn of one of my many talents.
I can stretch my face.

Woah dude.  I can use my sideburns like MAD.
I'm so crazy.
In every way.

Now then, I wish to post a conversation between Nathan and myself, which took place tonight.

See, if you read MY livejournal ( http://www.livejournal.com/users/hoshinotrigger/ ), then you'll see an extremely long conversation that is the most random thing I've ever seen/made.  
Nathan decided to challenge me.  And he lost.
Suckafoo.

I also MISS HIS POSTS.  But I must say....it is exam week for him, poor bi-examed soul.

Well, I don't know about you, but I worked today.  And what do I have to show for it?  Probably a couple of pictures?  You aren't wrong if you said that.
One could say that today was TOTALLY UNBUSY
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df37b3127cce86f8e8f902740000001610"">
It was kind of a grey day.  Gloomy.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df37b3127cce86f8e8fa83470000001610"">
Here's one of my car specifically.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df37b3127cce86f8e8e483590000001610"">
And some other dummy's car.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df37b3127cce86f8e8e2835f0000001610"">
I gave Tara-bull and Chandarina a list of things to do.  Most of them weren't even really things to do, just things.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df37b3127cce86f8e8e1026c0000001610"">

Gah, It was so lonesome.

""The Management"" (Carrie) told us that we needed to use the gross waxy cheap cups for our own personal drinks.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df37b3127cce86f8e8d6836b0000001610"">
So I obliged.

Best thing about work today was the Gilded Water Egg.
I made it myself.

This thing was so perfect, that I threw it, and it didn't burst.  And it rolled down into the parking lot, and stayed there for about an hour or so, until I went out and got it back from the rough tough streets of behind Kroger.

I eventually threw that at a car though."

Like one ton, minus 27.
Here we go!
First, there's this lil dude, named Kareem.  He's made of Cookies and Cream Ice Cream.  I named him Kareem, not only because it rhymes with cream, but also because it is almost the best name/ice cream pun ever.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669add8b00f0000001610"">
He says ""I so saaad.""
This is Nathan on the phone, doing an impersonation of the awesome wizard dude in Willow. ""WHICH finger is the most powerful,"" is that which he was saying.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adc6b0110000001610"">
And I went like ""Well, I really don't know, which one?""
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adc531220000001610"">
And that one made Nathan get off the phone, toss his hair back a bit, and say to me, ""You should know by now John.  Gah.  Moron.""
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adc331240000001610"">

It was a few hours more until something inspired a picture.
This thing was a visitor, Nicole.  Wheee.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adc0b0170000001610"">
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adc9312e0000001610"">
And Megan and Katy came by, at the same time...well a little after them, but they were all there at intersecting points in time.

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adcb312c0000001610"">

A little after that, The Ginyu 'Frorce ('fro...force...yeah) came by, and posed.
So freaking awesome.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adb6b0610000001610"">

Nathan had a marvelous idea about food tonight.  He said to me ""John, I brought Ritz crackers today, and we're going to go get some meat from Subway, and eat it with the crackers.""
I said to him ""Do you think that that will be enough sheer cracker?""
And thusly I was assured of cracker supply, which can be seen in this photo.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669adb4b0630000001610"">

Later, these people came by and tipped us the big bucks...I can't remember their names for the LIFE OF ME.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669be1e71680000001610"">
They're cool though.

Melodi the cutiepie came by after we closed, and she gave us hugs and got coffee whatevers, as well as looked good.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669be19f05f0000001610"">
She also touched her ear.

Tonight there were five highlights.
1. Second most epic rhyme battle ever, everything rhymed with -ank, and we used EVERY single -ank word in existance.  I won that one, which I was particularly proud of, because the -ank rhyme is a double point rhyme.
2. The food.  The crackers and meats and cheeses...amazing.
3. This. 
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669bef3f0b50000001610"">
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669befff0b90000001610"">
Now what happened here is....well, I was in the process of thawing yog, when the slippery slickery bad bag slippied out of my hands.
And onto the floor.
And split in half (the bag did).
And yog-dropped everywhere pictured.
The thing about it is that we left it.  Didn't clean it up at all.





















Well, okay, I didn't.  I cleaned it up, took an extra 30 minutes.  Thanks a lot gravity, needed that one.
4.  This.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669befbf0bd0000001610"">
This fridge is right next to the grease dumpster.  Outside.  Why?  I don't know why, but we like it.
And aside from that, Nathan kind of got hungry when we got out there.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669bef9f0bf0000001610"">
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df31b3127cce8669bee471920000001610"">
Mmmmm, mmmm.
5. We went to the movies tonight, and we tried to find Melodi, but oh well, we couldn't.  So instead, we went to every single theatre in there, and goofed around, acting like we were either looking for someone or something.  It was fun.

Oh and the Lord of the Rings theatre just had a huge white screen.  Both of us instantly thought ""photo op!""

That's pretty much it for me, wheee.

"event","Well, Big Red Nate can't post due to HOMEWORK..sucker. However, we took about 30 pictures today.
Exactly 30.
I'm probably only going to post about 20.

One of the first things that happened today when I got to TCBY was a sighting of The Streetdweller, Logan!
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8fbcf7aa60000001610"">
Nathan drew some, Including some amazing sketches of The Particle Accelerator Giant Pirate (not shown here)
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8fbccfb950000001610"">
Nathan was overcome with a burning desire to take pictures today, and took some of me.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8fbcd7aa40000001610"">
Here I am overcoming the cup with ice.  Death to it, by way of my mouth.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8fbcafb930000001610"">
Now here's one that I should tell you about.  Nathan says it's me in the throws of pain and ecstacy, while catching ice.
I call it awesome, and me catching ice with my mouth.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8fbcb7aa20000001610"">
Yep.

Nathan and I also decided to get some action shots of ourselves, us being the amazing acrobatic aromatic astonishing astronomers of awesome ascension that we are
(by the way, for that statement I made just now, I rule the NIGHT).
Anyway here's the pics.

Nathan has long legs, and jumps pretty high, however, none can fly like ME.

I'm like a freakishly awesome me, except in the air with a broom!

Well so then we decided to Kung Fu.  and Fu some Kung we did!

Look at the definition in my arm! Boy am I strong.

Also, I was serving this man, and Nathan takes a picture of the scene.  The best part is the man though, not me.
Just see for yourself.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8fbb37ada0000001610"">
Wow, he's a cool dude, I like him!!

Today, Nathan was the one to become a blur in space and time ITSELF!!
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffb2fbe90000001610"">
Woaaaaah.
Not many of you may know this, but Nathan has cool gloves.  These gloves are so cool, in fact, that they decided to stand and deliver...some writing for us.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffb37ad80000001610"">
Nathan became a Mullet...actually his hair became an idiot.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffb0fbeb0000001610"">
And here's a picture from the meeting we had tonight after Nathan and I got off of work.  Goodness, Amanda's really cute.  Too bad she ain't legal! haaahahaahaaaHAHAAAA.
Well anyway.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffb17ada0000001610"">

Now here's the interesting thing.
Nathan and I, while jumping off the three-staired....concrete sidewalk (sydewalke, because i like to spell badly, yet cool), became the 5th and 7th dimension themselves.  At these moments, we embodied all that one can see, feel, hear, taste, or smell in the 5th and 7th dimensions.
These are the best photos we could take of the monumental event.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffbf7ad40000001610"">
Note how Nathan here has two faces, both with different facial expressions and hair...and in different places.  Amazing.
Here I am.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffbcfbe70000001610"">
I, in my gay looking pose that I thought looked good when I was shifting dimensional existence, look green to the untrained camera.

After that, we got cold and went into Subway, and Brett was there.  He's a cool dude.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df27b3127cce85c8ffbd7ad60000001610"">


Bleeeh, I can't type any more of this!  Nathan will do the next post no matter what.

Well, when I got to TCBY today, Keith was.....well he wasn't there at that moment, but a couple afterward.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d108a02b0a0000001610"">
He came to pick up Chandy and Christina.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d108abaa310000001610"">
However, they were both taken to a ""movie"" by Tara-bull.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d2bfff0b420000001610"">

In all honesty, I doubt they really went to a movie.  They probably went to clubs and danced with boys!  Well, I also doubt that.  It's hard and difficult...and hard for me to believe either of those things!

So anyway, quite a few cool dudes and dudettes came by tonight

Jon Grubbs con girlfriend...incidentally, Jon aggreed to get Nathan an In-n-Out burger from California, should be a good show.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d1097bea790000001610"">
Also, Jill came by and gave me a lil smoochy.  That was HOT.  ;)
And last and best!!!!!! Kevin!

Kevin used to work at TCBY, just before the Dawn of the Age of Yogurtism...He was the first Yogurtist, the founder.
We love Kevin

Note the fact that Kevin looks like he's catching little hobbit John.  Because in reality, I am a hobbit, or may as well be.

Nathan made the most AMAZING record breaking parfait today.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d1431eea390000001610"">
Here's a second view of the masterpiece.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d14318ea3f0000001610"">
Note this as well: This parfait had FIFTEEN layers, three times the suggested layer layage.  Goodness, that was a masterpiece of parfait madness
Here it is from the hardest camera angle possible.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d14300ea270000001610"">
It was amazing because of the fact that Nathan and I worked so well in synchronized synergy that I knew to do the Matrix Limbo and take the picture of the underside of the parfait madness.
No words needed for that one.

Another thing: A monument to balance and accidents.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d143f36be40000001610"">
This is an interesting one.  The mop had fallen, for it was past its time.  Yet I, being the kind and benevolent floormopper I am, decided to raise the afflicted mop and begin mopping again.  However.
And this is an amazing however.
When I picked it up, the dustpan came with it, perfectly balanced, as one can see here.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d143f76be00000001610"">
AMAZED I was.  So much so, that I had to pull the camera from my pocket, and tell Nathan to take the pictures.
And so he did.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4df25b3127cce85d143faeadd0000001610"">
This is the last photo of my greatness embodied in balance and form.  You can see the awesome pouring from my hands, the wind of my fist burning with power and might.
I rock.

Wheew, that was a long one.  Is it sad that I've memorized the html for putting in an image?

Although el Yogunator and i have manipulated the schedules so that we work together on sunday night. AWESOME!!! we will hopefully have an awesome blast and take some more pictures ( cuz thats the whole point of existence ) and chill awesome. I had to take a part a machine yesterday it was no bueno just cuz i really really did not want to do it. although John came in an hour early and we worked one really busy awesome type hour together.   we had another couple of rhyme battles one of which John won by default the other one was a grand tie. Wednesday night ( new years eve )  we had the most epic awesome rhyme battle ever , which in a most epic fashion i one with the most awesome double attack of "" At the stroke of midnight i shall prance , in among the Elephants "" ( insert crazy shred guitar victory music and the dropping of the jaws of john as well as a multitude of patrons.)  Followed by the dirty hit ( while john was taking a picture of my victory pose ) when i said "" This picture, my victory it shall supplant ""  wow so awesome.

Also, Nathan and I had the most amazing rhyme battle ever fought, even including the ones between the divides in Glory and Amazing.  It was rhyming with ""ants""
It was a close battle, very close indeed, until one certain point where the hero arose and conquered me with a new found strength of rhyming capacity (after having gone to the dumpster and thinking about it for a while).

I was sad.
Yet still awesome.

I can't help it, I can't.

Sense is what that makes!
I work with Nathanamongo tonight, if things go according to plan.  It's going to be awesome.
And now the conclusion to this event, the likes of which have NEVER BEEN EXPERIENCED BEFORE, nor shall they ever be experienced again!

First, when I get to TCBYCYCB, Tara and 
Chandarina <img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce84877407007e0000001610""> 
both decide to leave.  Which means I'm alone from 5 pm until 7:30 pm.  And luckilly, this was the busiest part of the day...wait, unlucky.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774f5008c0000001610"">
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774ff00860000001610"">
So by the end of all that, I was pretty tired.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774fa81b30000001610"">,
And my feet were too <img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774e281ab0000001610"">
Then Nathan came, <img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774f881b10000001610"">
And everything was pretty much better from that point on.  Aside from the fact that I hadn't gone to the bathroom for two hours prior to his arrival, I was getting lonesome.

Well so later on, after talking about the SitComic, which is going to be the best thing EVER.  I'll let Nathan explain that.  Anyway, after we got done with most of that, we were taking out the trash, and came across something interesting.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774d700ae0000001610"">
That's right, THE GREASE DUMPSTER.  A dumpster specifically for GREASE.
So then we decided to be bad boyz for LIFE, and spit in it.
<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3cc06b3127cce848774ea81a30000001610"">

But only Nathan did, because I was kind of tired, and was taking the pictures.
We got out kind of late, but that's because we did a great job, like always.
Wait, did I say ""great?"" I MEANT ""awesome""

Anyway, Nathan and I worked last night, and MAN we totally owned everyone.  I mean, we had so many rhyme battles it was like we were rhyming all the time...ing!

But yeah, we had to do a LOT of extra stuff last night, including taking apart ALL the machines.  It took a long time, well longer than I expected anyway.

Also, we closed early.  That was cool.


Gah I can't WAIT until I get the camera, it'll be awesome.  Like me, except electronically awesome.

Note this:  This will contain entries from both Nathan and myself, as we both will have access to the password, and computers.  And so yeah, you'll probably be able to tell who's is who's.

Now then, if everyone will turn their attention to the comment buttons, you will all note the fact that one says  ""hokay, so...""

That means ""click me and comment on our awesomeness""
The other thing is THE WIND OF MY FIST.  It represents your comments, which are like the wind of my fist, in the fact that they are that which terraform the happiness of my day.
And we all want me to be happy.

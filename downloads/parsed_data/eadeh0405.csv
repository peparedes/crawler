"event","I don't understand the meaning of journal entries I dont really like online journals I used to have one on xanga then I got rid of it I  like to write down my journals and put them in this box of mine that way I can look back at them. And be like wow I am such a retard and realize the mistakes that I made a few years ago so I think I will end this live journal with a silent good bye. Not a total goodbye I will post pictures and stuff up here but its just useless to have it. I usually just come across my account after guessing my password a few times and just add a random journal entry as I am doing right now. Well I don't really know how to delete my profile. So I'll just pop by every now and then."

"event","Today was like the most awesome day ever! School was so amusing I had to take like 3 different tests and I thought I was going to fail but all my tests where very, very easy. In study hall I just got so bored so I started drawing on my already ripped in two places jeans. And I love it I came home and completed it. It was Rebecca Maholic's birthday today and I gave her this picture and she was like about to cry because she loved it so much. It made me happy that I made her happy. There was a tennis meeting after classes and it was really funny because me and Larua we where drawing on the chalk board the entire time stuff like about the hokages and yaoi and yuri is awesome it was quiet amusing.
 Okay so after school I watched episode 72 of Bleach it was very cute I love Ichigo he is hot! So Theresa my sister and I went to old Navy, Payless, Marshells, and Bath and Body Works. I got a new fuzzy jacket that reminds me of Kiba's I love it so much! Also I got a new Japanese Cherry Blossom lotion and it smells so good I want to go to Kyoto, Japan so badly!!
 So basically I had a very great day...."

"event","I have had those intresting days where I just feel like paying attention in class but this was seriously insane I did all my work in all my classes! I didn't even fall asleep in any classes and Mrs. Kavosnok was really impressed with my writing abilities I told her that I write a lot of stories and I enjoy it. She was like wow Rana this is very good. 
 And in studyhall I wen't to the library even though it wasn't my day mwuahaha.
I actually answered questions in Geometry but I was writing some of my story instead of paying really, really close attention. In spanish one this is the miracle I understood everything and senor is proud of me for taking notes. He was like Delia I can't believe your actually taking notes and paying attention in class. I was explaining to him how I always takes notes and pay a slight amount attention he almost had a heart attack.
 So I kind of have a lot of homework which I am going to do right now without procrastinating another miracle! I have geometry, and two tests tomorrow so I better get studying because I am really trying this year to get good grades. Gasp its like another miracle my Rana."

"event","This is just about as close of a good day as it will get since I do not have many of those. I went to school and pretty much as usual have tons of homework but the good part is that I got to chapter two in my Bleach story of a young girl discovering she is a human Shinigami and falls in love with Ichigo Kurosaki when she becomes the first division captain. Its actually a really good story so like yeah when I am done I will let someone read it and check it over. 
 So school was semi lame but afterwards I went to play tennis suddenly it was a practice drill very difficult for me though because I have not done dirlls in quiet a while I was panting really hard afterwards. I had a lot of fun though Mona came with me and we played in a point out I actually beat her it was quiet amazing. Me and Mona where by far the best their because it was like a lot of children there but I was not doing to fabulous in the beginning because of all the running we did. In the end I owned being one of the champions I am quiet proud of myself. So now I have to go shower when Mona gets out of there and stop fucking singing as well! Ugh so uh yeah I have a lot of homework I am just going to start it all right now toodles!"

"event","So I started writing a new story I like to write a lot so before I had a story about DN Angel nobody has even read it yet so haha and I won't let anyone read it either! Mwuahaha I don't know why though maybe because it is a private story for my own former obssession over Dark san. Now my new obssession is Ichigo ahaha I am such a noob I love it XP. So in other news school went by really fast today but I have so much damn homework so I have to go sit in my room and do all the homework or listen to music on the computer desk because my Itunes is so messed up that it doesnt let me load any music onto my Ipod and everything got deleted."

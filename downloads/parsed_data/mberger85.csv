God's faithfulness, unexpected sunny and warm days, fun school supplies, big stuffed ducks, being missed after being gone from home only 3 days, baking cookies while my sister ""helps"" just so she can spend time with me, shoulder rubs and jokes from my daddy, scaring the kitty, finishing a good book just for fun, looking at pictures from the ""good ol' days"", playing a familiar song on the piano, listening to Numa-numa in the car with Bethanie, walking onto my high school campus, being called ""shelly"", random surprises from my boyfriend that make me giggle, watching movies when it's dark outside, cleaning up the kitchen for mom, coming home to a super clean room, jack johnson and curious george, encouragement from my dad about frustrating job situations, being clueless about my future, getting sleepy at 8:30, wearing a t-shirt all day with no jacket, silly stories that only would happen to my mother, making new aquaintances, sleeping with socks on, learning new things about my Creator every day

"event","So here I am.... on spring break... at 9 pm, and I'm dead tired. It's funny, I always get tired earlier when I'm at home. Mom said it's the lack of adrenaline and stuff that needs to get done, so I dunno. 

I had some really cool important and profound things to say... but I don't know what happened to them. 


""I've made the most important discovery of my life. It's only in the mysterious equation of love that any logical reasons can be found.""
That is an amazing quote. My mom and I watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" tonight... I so much want to be a woman like the wife in that movie. She was so strong, and so loyal. I want to be someone like that to the one that I love... I can't wait till I can pour out my heart and life for someone like that, with nothing holding me back. 





I've discovered something this break. Okay, lots of ""somethings"". 
~God is more than ""really important"" -- He is absolutely essential to life and CANNOT take the back burner
~my dad is the most amazing man that has ever walked the planet
~having a home to come home to that is quiet, comforting and peaceful is the biggest blessing in the world
~i really REALLY like ducks
~having a clean room is an absolute necessity for my full functionality:-P
~my boyfriend is absolutely incredible, and i can't wipe the smile off my face because of him
~i love making cookies
~it is the most amazing thing to be surrounded by people who are fervent in their faith and who live in His light. 
~i miss my highschool teachers and friends, and their influence will stay with me for the rest of my life
~i love love love camping and hiking
~my alone time is extreeeeeeeemely important to me



:-) i love spring break. and i am now going to go play cards with my neighbor. hooray for best friends two doors away. and boyfriends 10 minutes away. and mommies and daddies who pray with you and listen to you blab and give you endless hugs. 
God is sooooo good."

"event","so i try REALLY hard not to get jealous. because i have something absolutely amazing. mind-blowing amazing. but it's so hard not to get jealous when i see certain people in relationships that have a certain something i'm wishing i wasn't missing. 
you see...i'm a hopeless romantic--i melt into a puddle on the floor when i see guys who can't say enough about their girlfriends, brag about them left and right, go on and on about them when talking to their friends, post countless pictures of them on their websites/walls/anywhere, and they make no hesitation to let people know that they adore their girlfriends. 
i know there are guys that just aren't like that... and i understand that. posting pictures of your girlfriend on facebook and mentioning her in your profile and constantly talking about her are not necessary things... but i just think that those things should come as a result of being in a satisfied relationship, don't you? i mean, maybe i'm wrong for wanting my boyfriend to be excited about me. or maybe i truly am a HOPELESS romantic... and it's hopeless for me to even be wishing for these things. and maybe i'm hopeless because all of this is ridiculously stupid to be talking about. i think it's exactly that. 
so thank you world, for letting me come to a realization of my own stupidity. i appreciate your input."

"event","so i am sitting here working on yet another past port page for dr. ediger, and it's raining outside. perfect weather to match my mood. don't get me wrong. i am happy--joyful in the Lord! there are some things that i am very content with right now, and i am very thankful for the way He is working in my life. but... i'm frustrated because we as Christians are *supposed* to be HAPPY all the time. whatever happened to having a bad day? waking up on the wrong side of the bed? it happens!!! everyone has bad days. no matter where you are, how old you are, who you are, what kind of person you are... we aren't supposed to always be happy-go-lucky, super hyper and ""on"" all the time. we are even told that ""there is a time to mourn...there is a time for everything."" so why are we constantly fed with the thought that we're supposed to be happy, and if we're not, we have to pretend nothing's wrong because ""oh my goodness, she's not a good Christian because she's not letting the joy of the Lord fill her and take away her sorrow."" i'm sorry, but has it ever occurred to anyone else out there that even Christians have hard lives? ESPECIALLY Christians have hard lives? Jesus didn't promise he would take away the hard times in our lives--he actually told us that things would probably get a good deal harder for us. So why do we think that our lives are supposed to be struggle-free and tear-free? so many people i know are so wrapped up in keeping their ""spiritual highs"" and making sure to keep their ""happy faces"" on so the people they come in contact with think they have it ""all together."" um... here's a newsflash--i don't have it all together, and i dont ever plan on being able to come to that point. i'd like to remind you of the little scene in the garden of gethsemane when Jesus poured out his heart to his Father. he was sweating blood. now i dont know where you come from, but that seems like a sign of a little distress. Jesus wept when he was about to raise Lazarus from the dead. He had the power to--and He knew He was going to, yet He still felt sorrow, and He still cried. 
IT'S OKAY TO CRY. 
maybe it's just myself that needed to hear all that. but maybe someone else needed to read this so they realize that they sometimes need to just shut up, slow down, and hold someone and cry with them...to not try to convince them of some profound theological fact, but to whisper in their ear that Jesus is there, and He's never going to leave, and that IT'S OK TO CRY. Jesus never tried to CONVINCE people to follow him, He just presented his heart, and held out his hand. i wonder why we as Christians spend so much time focusing on the pain in other countries, when there's oftentimes more hurt available to us to help heal right in front of our faces. 
but that's the thing--we as Christians are also really good at hiding. 'member those ""happy faces"" and the ""joy of the Lord""? i'll be honest--those are great ways for me to pretend everything's fine. and i do it a lot. 
i'm tired of pretending.

i've asked myself this question so many times recently... and i've come to the conclusion that people don't want this elusive 'love' as they call it, but what they want is LOVE--the LOVE that created them, the LOVE that calls them by name out of the pit of despair that they are in, the LOVE that knows each and every detail of their lives, the LOVE that knows their deepest longing and desire, the LOVE that will NEVER fail them... 
i include myself in this broad generalization of ""people""... 
i'm so sick of being failed by people in this world. i KNOW in my head that they will fail me, and i KNOW that the only One who won't fail me is Christ... but when they let me down, i still am hurt. and i still think that it's because of something i did... or i wonder if i'm ever gonna stop messing up... if i'm ever going to learn... 
frankly, i'm terrified of life right now. every time i think i've found something good, i get something ripped out from underneath me. i never know if the ""something"" i've found is truly good, or if it's just another one of my mistakes waiting to happen...

i have been filled to overflowing with blessings of friends recently that have been lifting me up when i'm down and encouraging me to ""keep my chin up"" and to remain joyful in Christ. newfound friends like James, Char and Emmy... my Jeffrey... and friends like Ben and Bethanie... and my family holds the highest place in my heart. i've never come to appreciate them more than i do now. i've had such a realization recently that my family is the one thing that will always be there when everything else fades away. these friends we think are going to be there for us *forever* really won't be...except for the rare and precious few. but family--that is one thing you will always have, and can never replace. there is NO ONE that gives me better support and more prayers than my parents... i've laughed harder with my sister than with anyone else on this planet... and there is no one in this world that understands me better, accepts me more willingly or loves me so unconditionally as they all do.

""Everything is permissible for me--but not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissible for me--but I will not be mastered by anything.
...whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.""


My mom says that I've been given a gift of joy--and whenever I go through hard times, she always encourages me with that and challenges me to not let the devil steal my joy. Something that has hurt me recently is that I haven't been able to express that joy to others in a way that they can see. I've been told that I actually need to <i>work on</i> being joyful, keeping a smile on my face, etc. But you see...all my life I've been told that that's my gift--that I'm joyful, and that I always have a smile on my face, and I'm always cheerful... so what's different now? Someone please tell me if I've completely turned my back on my gift...turned from my joyful self into someone else... I know that this year has been different. Being cooped up in my room constantly doing homework doesn't exactly do much for the fact that I love to be around people... and my job doesn't really do much for that either since I sit in a cubicle and stare at a computer or go stare at book spines all day... and I know a lot of it has to do with not having any close support for my spiritual life or companionship that I can engage in healthy conversation with. I'm just plain sick and tired of the superficial and shallow conversation about who hates who, who's looking ugly today, who's such a jerk, how much so-and-so wishes so-and-so would notice them, and the fact that my hair just might not be looking perfect today and heaven forbid that I don't have the most perfect stomach. What happened to encouraging, uplifting, fun, clean, engaging conversation? I have to ask myself the last time someone asked me ""how are you"" and I actually felt like they cared about my answer... and that I actually felt comfortable telling them really how I was. And the last time that led into a conversation of more than 3 minutes. I miss the days when I could sit with my friends and talk for literally hours about our lives, our families, our struggles, our happinesses...without ever broaching the rude and degrading gossip that so permeates my surroundings now... I miss the simplicity of the conversation I have with my family... when I can ask my dad a completely random and sometimes stupid question, and he'll answer me in his matter-of-fact way, explaining something so I'll understand and he won't make fun of me because I didn't know that already... and I can make a comment about something random and what would otherwise be considered ""silly"" or ""stupid"" ... but he and I can actually have a conversation about it. 
So maybe I'm just incredibly dissatisfied with life right now. Can I not admit that? Or do I have to cover it up with a smile and say that I'm just fine and dandy? Maybe that's what I've been doing all along... just pretending that I'm all right...and it's starting to backfire. Maybe I can't fake it anymore. Maybe it's my surroundings that make me unhappy. Maybe I'm disgusted by the world that I live in. Maybe I'm turned off by the insincerity, lack of integrity, and complacency I find every corner I turn. 

Wow. So does this even tell you anything more about me? Maybe... maybe not. I guess I can't be the judge of how much you actually know me or not. And I can't really ask you to try to get to know me either. Because that's totally up to you. All I ask is that you care. I don't want you to pretend to want to know me. 
I want you to <b>want</b> to know me. That's all."

i have my rehearsed answers...the answers i've given people for years... and they make sense to me, but when i try to explain them to other people, they don't understand. and that only makes me question my standards/decisions... like, am i just being old fashioned? backwards? stupid? naive? scared? silly? inconsiderate of other people? a cop out? too cautious? 
why do i stand by my choices... is it because i'm afraid of change? or is it because i really feel that i want to 'save my first kiss'...? why do i feel so frustrated when i'm approached about my decisions? maybe it's because i dont feel supported in my decisions, or i feel attacked or pressured to change. or maybe it's because i actually want to do something different... but then i dont feel like i can for some reason. i dont know why though... ultimately it's my decision... no one's telling me i have to do anything differently... 

so, yet once again, i come to the place where i have to ask myself ""WHY"" i've chosen to save my first kiss for this long. these are my answers... as ridiculous as you (or I...) may think they are.
i've waited because i don't want to have this long list of guys i've kissed.
i've waited because i didn't want to get hurt.
i've waited because i wanted to be mature in my decision-making.
i've waited because i'm terrified.
i've waited because i feel that saving my first kiss keeps my physical boundaries/standards high (even though it is fully possible to majorly screw up without kissing someone)
i've waited because i feel that keeping the focus of a relationship off of physical contact will help me and my boyfriend grow together spiritually and emotionally, apart from dependence on sexual pleasure.
i've waited because i'm a hopeless romantic and i want the first boy that i kiss to be my last.
i've waited because i want to GIVE my first kiss to someone, not have it taken from me.

i'm still waiting because all of these are still true...
and i feel that if i've waited this long...why should i just throw that all away now? 
if he's worth it, he'll be willing to wait... right?

but then there's the part of me that really wants to... and then there's the other part of me that wonders how i will draw lines as far as physical contact when that boundary is no longer in place.
i'm so scared of messing up."

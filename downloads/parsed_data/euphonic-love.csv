"event","Some new art, though not HP inspired. I was listening to Panic! At the Disco and was triggered&nbsp;by the line 'oh, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy.' I then drew this whore-ish looking marrionette.<br /><br />(Haha, oh gosh, that song just came&nbsp;up on my MP3. Talk about creepy.)<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Clicky Moi""><img alt="""" src=""http://i60.photobucket.com/albums/h21/working_fire/CaricatureofIntimacy.jpg"" /></div>&nbsp;"

<p>As for the second picture, this one is a bit of a different style, for me, and is of Narcissa. You can't see her face, but I was trying to experiment more with color and flow than with actual body parts.<br /><br /><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;Secrecy<br /><strong>Rating:</strong> G<br /><strong>Comments:</strong> Watercolors are le cool.

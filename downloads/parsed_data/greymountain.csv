I make walls for myself. 

 Whenever I am about to do work, instead of just doing it and trying really hard...which is what i expected before going into this program... I fear all the work that is ahead of me. Before i went into animation... i thought the hard work was going to be fun! I always thought it was before... Although i have to say... learned how to procrastinate hard. 

I have to learn how to make hard work fun. It will always be difficult and long..but not trying at all is making my skill set worse and my habits worsen. I am scared of...burning out. I wonder if i should keep working my ass off...anyways... even though i may fail. STUPID me. Thinking about giving up... putting up more walls. 

I have to stop blaming other people.
I am now in a better situation. 
I have to look and be better. 

GYAD i also have to lose weight. 

WORk on your DAMN ESSAYS, ASHLEY! WORK DAMN YOU! You.. have to at LEAST Do your ..friggin.. stupid... what are they called... Electives!!!!
DO THEM NOW!!!

I used to know that working hard built friendships. It made you suffer with everyone else...and also make them love you back... even chris lee (rain of animation) is doing better than me this year. I should shape up.. and not be such a turd. Can I do it? Can i work hard? Can I stop being such a sucker for emotions and social things? 

I have to stop conforming... 
I have to become great...
I must stand out...
I want to be better. Act. Do. Speak. 

Be the person i wanted to be... hard working, humble, and fantastic.

"event","Ah, yes. It has definitely been a while since I've updated anything. I think everyone has changed and grown hopefully for the better! I am currently somewhat struggling in motivation with my fourth year film. It's like I must do this for some reason every semester. When will the madness stop!?

During my procrastination, i have been watching the following shows:

- how i met your mother
- big bang theory
- 30 rock


Fa-antastic!

My sister just had a baby, named Tadgh.  *pronounced 'taig' like tiger*   Why they screwed the kid up with a cool sounding name with spelling that no one will ever read out right unless they're Gaelic Irish? The kid will enjoy the name, nonetheless. 

Random note:
What I've learned over the summer was that in the past 4 years, apparently i had been the 'safe' friend to some of my girlfriends. I was the one who was in a long term relationship, didn't really care for wearing any sort of stylish attire, and was physically not a threat. 

... 

I have received some negative attention, since then. 

This is what happens when you associate with drama queens. They're fun and exciting at first, but then you get sucked into their drama-filled lives.

I refuse to listen to anyone's life problems in the animation program from now on. (i.e. gossip, relationship troubles, etc)

This will prevent me from getting involved in anyone's issues."

Wise words about friendships and relationships in life. It reminds me much of the many things that have happened over the past years and those kinds of things will still happen years to come. It is preformed by this comedian/writer/actor who cross-dresses to play the Madea in the family. Much like a nana or grandmother. Yes it's a bit ""cultural"" but it's quite cute. Watch it if you've ever been hurt before... meaning everyone.

I have to say though, i'm glad i made it, but at the same time, i sacrificed SO MANY DUE DATES and hwk being done on time for it. AUGH exhausting. Plus i've only had 3$ in my account since the beginning of november. 

Update on our film:
The people in my group film is doing alright but no one except two people can storyboard. Yes it's a rough and now the editing process is being done but too bad, it's only the most important part of this whole operation. Robin is horrible at boarding but won't let anyone criticize him. But, Ti loves to disagree with people so when she steps up and overly insults a huuuuge 300 pd guy, arguments break out.

"event","Whoa. It's wierd having that title... I'm a third yeeeearrr... (((hears the leaves rustle outside))). It's kinda nice but now that i look back, i have no idea why i worshipped the feet on which the 3rd and 4th years walked upon. This year, I'm kinda dreading homework and group work politics this year. But, i'm going to try and be on top of that. Plus, my life drawing teacher said that he'll make me the best life drawer in class if I going to extra life drawing classes everyday. DUDE... that's 3 hours of my time besides my classes, everyday! When the hell do i make room for homework?!

We're about to be put into groups next week and at the same time, getting ready for co-op this summer. Scaaarryyyy. All my classes are scheduled for 9am - 4/5pm everyday. I'm kinda overwhelmed but at the same time, slightly excited. 


My body hurts every morning trying to wake up. I get cranky and insecure when i'm tired. Maybe it's because i feel vulnerable. i live with three boys and as much as i love them, being the only girl will always feel left out in some way. (Although i'm having a lot of fun gaming with them or joking around). AUGH, I can't wait until i'm done school. 

My older sister is moving to toronto around october or november. I can't believe the whole friggin family will be back in one city. Gross... (in a loving kinda way).

On another note, I'm going through a learning stage in this time and life where i'm realizing who are real friends and who aren't. Before i was in college, i was the ""Anyone can be my friend"" - person. Then fights, lies, and wierd misunderstandings happened. I lost myself in all this and  lost all trust in myself and others. Finally, I just got over the ""dont trust anyone"" stage and am just starting to accept the idea of not having to try so hard to be someone's friend. No one should ever try so hard to make someone feel loved or trusted. It's not just up to you but that person as well to trust you, right? It should just be natural. If you don't naturally get along with that person - sometimes you just have to let go. It doesn't mean you can't be on good terms, just ... not close close anymore. 

Guys do this. It's kinda simple in a lazy way. 

I think i've learned my lesson on procrastination... again. lol! I don't think i deserve to say such a thing, but you know what i mean. GAD i talk such shit when it comes to promising not to procrastinate. It's in my genes. I learned it from my family and parents.

It has to do with moving to another place, the price being much higher, and we have to paint it. BLUH! My new roommates will be D, Di, and Clayton. Wierd! No girls in the house! This is the first for me except whenever i go to chris's place. My carpet is a 70's chocolate brown (yuck... but comfortable) and the walls are painted a nasty pale - dirty yellow. It makes the rooms seem dark and gross, probably from the lack of light. I'm not used to no light!!! 

Lately, I've discovered online T.V. broadcasting! It's been around for a while, but i just haven't jumped on it yet. I've googled up some Korean, J-pop, and other sites. I was hoping to find an anime stream (hehehehehe) but it doesn't look like it exists. Instead, i'm stuck with a lot of news and music video broadcasts. I guess it's better than nothing. 

I miss tv. I know... i know... there's a lot of useless crap, but it raised me.

I've been watching channels such as Oh!samaTV, JapanARadio, and ArirangTV. I think my dad would be proud of me hearing a korean radio show. 

You can check them out but i've got to warn you, half the time either your cable won't be able to handle a certain channel.

It was really sweet and quite docile while handling it. I fell in love when i was first holding it.  I bought a pretty big cage without a starter's kit so i had to buy everything from scratch. 


It's so sweet! It's a big fall of soft fluff and it loves to eat. Lately his temperment has gotten much better! He gets really excited when i come near the cage. He expects fresh vegetables and yogurt drops.  But, now i think he actually wants to come out too. 

I will post pictures sometime this week. 


He brings me a lot of joy and i'm much happier in oakville with him. He's my companion and friend (or more like a fluffy baby) and he eases the loneliness i feel here in this hick town. My very good friend Leepoy ( possibly one of the nicest and sincerest person i've ever met and you'd all love) bought treats for it and a nest. It kinda just likes to pass through the nest because it's a bit too small. I think he really needs one of those hamster homes because i think he'd feel a lot more secure and happier with his privacy.

Name: Pi Lo Chun (Spring Green Snails) Tea
Type: Green tea
origin: <font size=""2"" face=""arial, helvetica"">two mountains in the west part of Dongting in Jiangsu province, China
Color: Light Yellow-green
Smell: Deep aroma, honey, sweet, light, (apparently apricot-y but... it's honey), hint of green tea smell
Taste: Sweet, hint of herbal notes, low in acidity compared to other teas, peachy
</font>
<font size=""2"" face=""arial, helvetica"">        My roommate Tim, got this tea from China from his grandfather. Apparently this tea originated from their home town. I'm drinking it now and it tastes... simply for the lack of the better word... <b>joygasm</b>. I highly recommend it. I would probably imagine that this tea would go well with desserts or fruits very well. </font><font size=""2"" face=""arial, helvetica"">According to tenren.com, Pi Lo Chun tea was named by a chinese king who felt that steeped tea leaves looked like snails. This high grade tea is about 31$ for 100g. None of the leaves were broken and were dried in a swirl curl. The leaves didn't really open up, though... that might be bad on my part, but i have no clue. 

</font>      On a side note: I was watching the first two episode of Sky girls. Then i thought to myself, if i were to save a town and they wanted to give me a bunch of rare nuts, i would say, ""Bitch, give me some of your tea""!

""I am Prince Caspian...""
XD
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee

They made this character play a much more sexier role than i thought he'd be portrayed. But, that's Disney producers for you... 

Have any of you read some if not all of the Narnian Chronicle books? I think i've probably read up to... the book after this one... When i saw this trailer, i'm actually anticipating it quite  a bit. I hope they don't make the romance scenes too much cheese, though. It's also about bloody time they start working on angsty scenes and characters! Ahhhh-prince caspian... I'm actually kind of suprised that they didn't make ""A Horse's boy"" first which tells the tale of how Prince Caspian came to be. I think it's a lot better, personally as a story."

What i'm really excited about this term is learning digital painting, yay! FINALLY i'll be able to really learn how to paint on photoshop and all those fancy shmancy drawing/painting applications. But dammitall why do<strong> i have such a poor sense in color</strong>? maybe it's because i never actually ever had a natural eye for it. <br /><br /><br />maybe i can actually start posting up stuff i feel is somewhat worthy. <br /><br />A couple weeks ago <strong>i accidentally downloaded a virus onto my computer. I</strong> tried reformatting it this week but only to find out that i didn't have software for my ethernet card. Thus, Hiru chan had to find it for me and send it to me via school computers. I also left my phone charger at his place so i've had no way of contacting anyone. My cable-less t.v. and playstation were all that could keep me company through the lonely nights. It's terrible living away with no phone or internet with an apartment FULL of people who aren't particularly close to you unless you spoke mandarin. <br /><br />We also now have a <strong>new life drawing teacher. <br /></strong><br />... <br /><br />WHERE HAS HE BEEN ALL MY LIFE?! He's AMAZING!!! OH MAN! (if you have been keeping up with my entries, the last life drawing teacher was originally a fine arts teacher. Meaning she was horrible at life drawing and knew nothing of real human anatomy). <strong>Everyone (especially me) were blushing</strong> half the class cause we were all so happy. It doesn't mean that aaaaaaall the info that he threw at us about the muscles and whatnot weren't overwhelming. I feel that <strong>most of us will fail this exam next week - but we'll all end up better artists at the end of this semester.</strong>"

The fire alarm in my building is going off... 

I got out of my room, stood in front of my roommates, and looked at each other. 

We all knew the question I was about to ask them which was whether or not we should all evacuate the building. 


""We'll die together.""

Since i have started knitting, this is my first creation:
I sewed all of the holes up with yarn and put it together to make a cup warmer/holder thingy!

Here's the second thing i 've made with no holes but with very uneven edges. A coaster! Yaaaay!

My next new thing is a scarf! Whoppas! I've gotten about 60cms from a week since i haven't had a lot of time to knit but it's getting there. Astrael_nyx - chan posted up videos of south park FINALLY making a spoof on guitar hero... and i must say... it was no disappointment. AUGH it was hilarious! 

In September when I was sort of homesick, I started to upgrade my room a little. So, I put up random pictures, put up nature-y shapes and whatnot. Yay! I have a cute room. Yes, it doesn't look like pictures from Ikea catalogs but i can't really do that much on a very low budget. Btw, thank God for thumbtacks. You can hammer it in only to have a very small and very unnoticeable hole.

My computer's hard disk failed on me several days ago so i lost all my pictures, files, music, videos, memories... everything. So, Hiru-chan came over and fixed it for me. Yay!

8:30 am learned how to cast. It's pretty darn easy if you ask me!

9:15 am tried to do the first row again

"event","<div text=""My response to Kimchi Mama&#39;s blog about Korean mothers..."" class=""ljcut""><br /><br />From all of my sisters in my family, I actually look a lot more like my uncle for some reason. I have the smallest no-lid eyes (which is wierd because everyone has lids and have med to big eyes), I am the heaviest (and that makes my dad pick on me more about diets), the biggest nose (which is a mixture of my dad's big nose and my mom's round one), and I'm the youngest.<br /><br />This means that all my sisters and my parents look at me in such a way that I got all the bad left overs or something. WHATEVER! I think that's why i've grown up avoiding or fearing koreans.<br /><br />It took a long time for me to accept myself for who i am and love the things I have. A very long time. ... Esp since my parents are the very old fashioned korean parents. You koreans know what i mean... The ones that like to honneh (lecture) you about every little thing and call you very cold things. It's those ajimas (adult-old ladies) that said those things to you, have grabbed my stomach fat with their hands out of no where telling me how I could lose it.<br /><br />Are they living my life?  Do they really discern whether I or anyone else's child is pretty or not? Raise your children to be healthy, confident, and happy kids. Not one that had to feel as annoyed about their looks when they really didn't have to.<br /><br />***This was a response to Kimchi Mama's blogspot where Nabi mama talks about her issues with her mother and her mother's friends.<br /><br /></div><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I came across this music video and the lyrics (which were probably written by someone else) really hit me. I seriously could relate to the words that were sung. Because for the majority of the beginning of my relationship, I avoided trying to get too attached and showing any signs of vulnerability. I struggled with my feelings for him. I had this need to distance and protect myself. I didn't really know what this feeling was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Every time I hinted at him with a romantic notion of my feelings for him, it sort of... well, lets just say we should all know by now that you can't hint things with men. Thus, I tried so hard to deny any sort of hopes and dreams with us being together. I'd secretly daydream of one of us dissapointing each other by either changing our feelings for one another or even to the extremes of unfaithfulness, very often((mainly being his fault)). lol. All girls are a little witchy, mind you.  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     But obviously during these 3 years, things have happened and those walls have been slowly broken down. I, as any person in a relationship, still have those fears once in a while but they've been pretty much put to rest. New feelings and new hopes have budded and grown to new areas in my life.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     In this music video sung by Rihanna, called  ""I hate that I love you"", was something that i personally could understand and relate to at one point in my life. Enjoy!  <br /><br /><lj-embed id=""22"" /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the way Rihanna is tossing and turning? How she's waiting and starring at the time?  When she just can't stop thinking about him no matter where she goes? She's not dying<u><b>, she's being mentally tortured!<br /><br /></b></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, people who are getting pressured by their friends, parents, of whatever - Don't rush for it. It's not easy. It's a turmoil and hurricane of emotions that hit you like a big friggin truck in the face.<br /><br /><br />p.s. I don't so much ""hate"" it anymore. :<br />: )"

    Lately, I've been having a lot of self-doubt. I'm scared that I won't do well this school year because I won't manage my time well. Because of that, I won't push myself to do better. In animation, it's not enough to just complete assignments. It's what you learn from them and how far you pushed yourself to make it better.

    I had this goal before I started this course, which was to inspire others around me. I haven't really been doing that at all since the workload hit. I think I'm just so obsessed with being comfortable, rather than challenging myself. 

    Is it possible to balance a job, friends, family, a love-life, and still manage to improve in art? Am I just not trying hard enough? What do i have to tell myself everyday in order to make that happen?"

    Starbucks is a bitch, as usual. Half of the shift supervisors are harsh, very negative, and very cliquey. The other half which are all coincidentally gay make me look forward to work and getting paid. I have a lot of suggestions as to how to improve the quality of our starbucks at yonge and college but they have to do with mood, mannerisms, and attitudes. My starbucks manager sort of flipped out and now he's on vacation. DEAR GOD i hope he comes back refreshed and happier than ever-remembering his skills as to how to be a great manager. When he's angry - the whole store(workers only) look as though they've been hit with an earthquake. Suddenly the goals are uncertain. The shifts are sad and angry.

***Do NOT look at the video. ONLY Listen to the music.***

<lj-embed id=""14"" />

It's actually my sister's theme songs, so if he had sisters, that's what he would hear everyday. I think all my sisters have talked like they do in the song. It's a funny song done by a comedian by the named of Liam Sullivan... or something. But he also did the very famous song ""shoes"". Look it up on youtube if you want to see it's craziness. IT's really funny at first but then it becomes a bit dark."

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH There's going to be a late fee and he'll blame meeeeee!!!! ((pulls hair)) OK! OK! Fine! I shouldn't have trusted my own dad. I should have just done it by myself. Now, I'm going to get in big friggin trouble! 

     I'm feeling a liiiiittle down today (Could you tell?). Partially because I've been over my bf's house for the past couple of days. Thus, my parents are really giving it to me. That's my fault, i know. I think my whole family is made up of procrastinators. I wondered where it all came from, and then i figured it out when I saw watched my parents one day scramble for my last year's tuition and income tax reports. Which, they blamed me for when it had to be rushed last minute. 

     I think when I watch my parents work so hard, it pushes me too. When they support me, I do the same thing. But when they totally do the opposite, I don't reciprcate to their expectations.

     Because I haven't been getting the same kind of support and guidance that I've had for so many years anymore, I'm slipping. I'm not as social, nor good at keeping very needy friendships, strong, or proud of myself as i used to be when i had that hand to guide me. What was this strong force? Honestly, I'll tell you it was God and Grandpa. Not that both of them aren't with me at all, it's just... I won't go on about that part. I thought I was good for the past few months. With my job in Starbucks, I had some hope. But that ended when i started to see my payroll and just about how much I'm really getting. 

     What really is starting to suck is i'm beginning to see my sister falling into a very twisted and evil relationship... which I won't go too deep into either. It's her choice. I'll be supportive. But that doesn't mean i have to like the guy. ((Don't even assume that you might know what the situation is, here.))"

R.I.P Earring


My white sakura flower dangling earring fell into Chris's sink. He's sleeping right beside me right now, so nothing can be done really. 

I've always recieved many compliments from it. It always matched with most white outfits. 

...oop! nevermind! It's been rescued!  yaaaaaay"

"event","NOOOOO! The Korean fever is coming in one very messy spill!!! 

How? I came accross this video on youtube and it just blew me away. <strong><u>Stephen Colbert</u></strong> compares himself to the very famous <strong><u>korean r&amp;b singer Rain</u></strong>. He goes on to compare him to N. Korea's leader by calling him ""Rain Jong Il"" ... That just about killed me. I don't know how <strong>Rain got on Time's Magazine's #1 on the 100 list of 2007's most influential people</strong>, but that's just crazy. Not only that, he's above Colbert! 

<strong>He even makes his own Korean music video</strong>. My favourite part of this vid is the very last line. 

<lj-embed id=""13"" />


I never really ever knew about Rain until Steph mentioned that he was coming to Toronto (which was recently cancelled) to preform live. Then, at Andrew's b-day, Rylan and Tim starts dancing to his music in a very corny and hilarious style. Thus, I was thinking about it randomly tonight and I felt the need to look up his music videos to check out what he's really about. He has some pretty nice cinematography in his mvs but I think his coreographer needs to bring a little more class into his cornball dance routines. I'm not saying that they're not impressive... just ... corny!"

"event","This is probably one of my favourite opera duet/duels  so far. This clip is from a movie called Opera Bianca e Fernando. It's sung by Jerome Pruett. I have this feeling that it was entirely sung by him but he differentiated it a bit. One was a bit stiffer than the other.  

<b>A funny thing my sisters and i remember from this movie is the fact that there's this one part in the clip where the one guy screws up. EUN (my oldest sister) would imitate him disgustingly well! It's hilaarrrrious. She'd sing it over and over and over. We'd be either flailing on the bed, or holding our knees laughing. If only i could tape it. She'd throw me through a wall... so I'm not sure if it'd be worth it. 
</b>

     So basically, what happens in this part of the movie is the two best opera singers in Italy have retired, and have a bet on who could teach the next best singer . They made a very last minute rule to the bet the night (i think) before the duel. Whomever loses gets shot... or loses the girl. In order to create a fair competition, they must wear masks and outfits which will conceal their features. 

<lj-embed id=""6"" />

     Wasn't that gorgeous? The only problem is when the main protagonist takes off the mask, from the song an audience would expect a very graceful, a very elegant man. Instead... you get...

Count Chocula...

Heeheehee

((watching this clip over and over))
     I personally don't really like listening to Pavarotti. I tried. But He's... not that... ehh.. he sounds too old. But this song blows me away. It makes me feel somewhat hazy and happy. This is probably the best part in the movie. Count Chocula tends to act very gay when he's listening to the main girl sing. In fact, that's the exact same way my sister acts when she's listening to symphonies. He's great at lipsynch, though. If you want to see what I mean, you can watch <lj-cut text=""this clip"">

<lj-embed id=""9"" />

Do you see!? 
When he opens his mouth and then bites his lips??? His little looks?!

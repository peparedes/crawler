"event","I decided to indulge my Peter O'Toole fetish by trawling that bastion of evil known as http://www.play.com and encountered this.  Considering I'm working on seeing all of his Oscar-nominated roles, I snapped it up.

And, y'know, I'm rather glad I did.  I <em>love</em> this film.  (And not only for the sight of Peter O'Toole, in black breeches, frock coat and top hat, slapping a hunting whip against his knee-length leather boots, with a lust-inspiring savagery.  No, really.)

When the 13th Earl of Gurney dies in an accident involving a ballet skirt, a sword and auto-erotic asphyxiation, his son inherits the estate.  Unfortunately, Jack Arnold Alexander Tancred Gurney, 14th Earl of Gurney, is a little detached from reality.  He thinks he's Jesus Christ, which is all a tad embarrassing for his family.

Cue a nefarious scheme from Jack's uncle, the ultra-respectable Sir Charles Gurney...  Jack must produce a male heir, at which point he can be safely certified and locked away.

However, Sir Charles is working against Jack's wife and his psychologist, neither of whom want Jack committed.  And, at the last moment, they succeed.  The 14th Earl of Gurney no longer thinks he's Jesus Christ; he <em>knows</em> he's Jack.

Jack the Ripper, that is.

And, not surprisingly, <em>this</em> Jack is welcome in society, politics and strangers' beds...

<em>Ruling Class</em> is a wonderfully vicious attack on the British class system - everything from the Church of England to the House of Lords, with a sideswipe at socialism in the form of Arthur Lowes' radically left-wing butler.

The acting is wonderful throughout and Peter O'Toole thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination."

"event","I came across this in one of my Big Boxes o' Books the other day, realised I'd never finished it and decided a Mercedes Lackey book was just the kind of brainfluff I needed.

After two pages, I remembered <em>why</em> I'd never finished it.

It's a bad sign when a novel set in the past opens with a disclaimer to the effect of ""I couldn't be arsed doing any research but it's a fantasy so I don't need to, la, la, la.""

The story opens in what I think is supposed to be turn-of-the-century London.  It's difficult to tell.

The heroine is, of course, involved with the Suffragettes [1] which would imply it was around 1910 but the attitudes of the medical establishment suggest 1880s [2] while there are rants about injuries which seem to go with the start of the Industrial Revolution.  Just to jar further, there are comments that both Madame Blavatsky and Aleister Crowley are around and active at the time, even though Blavatsky died in 1891 and Crowley didn't become interested in the occult until 1896.

Of course, all the British males are arrogant, sexist, racist and unbelievably stuffy.  Of course, all the working class people have 'earts of gold, moi loidy (and accents from the Dick Van Dyke school of acting).

The plot is your average Lackey rent-a-plot - beautiful heroine, evil opponent, brave and loyal lover, blah, blah, blah - and the characters are even more cardboard cutout than usual.

With one, very, very irritating exception.  I have no objections to fanfiction.  What I <em>do</em> object to is Lackey nicking Lord Peter Wimsey, changing his surname, removing a lot of his complexity and claiming him as her own character.  Not to mention swiping observations made by Dorothy L. Sayers and claiming them as her own.

So, all in all, ignore this one.  In fact, better than that.  Pick it up and hurl it out the window, before proceeding to ritually cleanse yourself.

[1] Even though it's evident that Lackey actually intends her to be involved with the Suffragists.  Big difference between the two groups.  Huuuuuuge fecking difference between the two groups.  The Gettes went in for bombs and hurling themselves in front of racehorses and chaining themselves to railings and generally did more harm than good.  The Gists were the responsible people who discussed things and came to arrangements and who actually got suffrage for women.

[2] The heroine's use of carbolic acid is considered to be radical, even though Lister had published his findings in 1867 and carbolic spray was in common use by the mid-1870s."

"event","Let me explain a little about Swordspoint. The subtitle is 'A Melodrama of Manners' which, in my arrogant opinion, is half-right. Manners - in its broader sense of public behaviour versus private motivations - are right at the heart of this novel. Melodrama, however, is lacking. Thankfully.

Swordspoint is set in an unnamed city that bears some resemblance to Renaissance Edinburgh/Paris/London/Florence with a hint of modern New York. It's a world that Kushner doesn't dwell on a great deal but which, you can tell, is fully realised in her head. Not necessarily the physical location but the, to me, far more important socio-political aspects. (It's bleeding obvious the city's in a temperate climate. I don't need to know that it sits on the River Kradas, south of the mighty kingdom of Wersken. I _do_ need to know that it's a wealthy city, with a delightful level of hypocrisy and double-dealing as the norm.)

The focus of the novel is Richard St Vier, a young swordsman at the height of his fame. Through the complex, yet unwritten, social rules that govern life amongst the aristocracy on the Hill, St Vier fights duels on behalf of wealthy patrons. The novel tracks his relationship with the mysterious Alec and how they are both drawn into the vicious politics of the Hill.

Yet there's more to the novel than that. Each character is deliciously complex. Those that, at first glance, are likable soon reveal inner decay. The powerful prove to be weak; the honourable far from it.

St Vier is, to me, the most interesting of the bunch. The St Vier we see today is detached, dedicated to his lover and, it seems, entirely lacking a temper. Yet there are hints dropped throughout that this isn't how St Vier has always behaved. There are frequent references to how he used to 'play' on the Hill, as both guest and lover of the aristocrats. There is also mention of him laughing until he cried for no reason that the narrator can remember. This is _not_ the St Vier we see today.

The explanation for this change is given only briefly but it explains a lot.

And yet... Now St Vier's lover is Alec, a stranger to the disreputable area of Riverside, who delights in creating discord and hostility. St Vier spends his time killing those who would retaliate to Alec's insults and weathering Alec's verbal assaults upon himself. Is this a form of self-punishment? Is St Vier testing himself?  Is simply that he loves Alec?

This is one of the many delights of Swordspoint - the subtlety. Nothing is spelled out openly and important character traits and plot developments are sketched lightly. You need to engage your brain to get the most from Swordspoint.
Which leads me, oh so conveniently, to those who don't like this novel...

After a thorough Google-ing, I came across three negative reviews.  All were from men who praised the action-led style of speculative fiction. Among the criticisms levelled were that the writing style was 'turgid', that the characters were undeveloped and the plot lacked excitement.

Well, people are entitled to their opinions, no matter how misguided and blatantly bloody wrong.

For me, the writing style is one of the most beautiful things about this novel. Kushner has a poetic grasp of phrasing and articulation. It isn't an action-packed novel so it doesn't have an action-packed style.

The characters are far from undeveloped. Instead, their personalities are shown through their actions, rather than through paragraphs of internal conversation. The characters are also infinitely complex. There are no 'good guys' and 'bad guys'; there is no black-and-white definition of good and evil. There are just people.

And the plot... Well, there are no bangs (other than the fireworks display) and what gore there is isn't described in loving detail. Thank god.  It's intricate and political and I find something new every single time I read it."

"event","I don't like graphic novels.  (Or comics, if you want.)

No, really, I don't.

I find them difficult to read.  I concentrate so much on the text that I tend to ignore the art and it all gets pointless.  They're awkward to read in bed or in the bath because I have to turn the pages so often.  This even applies to Sandman.  (Though I read it anyway because I'll ready pretty much anything by Neil Gaiman.)

Which brings me to Transmetropolitan.

Damn, but that's good.

The art is of such a high standard that I keep finding I'm ignoring the text.  Spider actually looks his age (with occasional breaks for snarling and kicking the shit out of people).  There's sufficient detail to keep the pictures interesting without becoming distracting.

And it has the whole future-technological-dystopia thing going on, complete with attacks on Delia Smith and Tony Blair.

It's savage, it's vicious, it's sharp, it's witty, it's downright wonderful."

"event","Good lord but that was an utterly dreadful film.  It appears to be one of the spate of films that was trying to be Brassed Off but it failed miserably.  The pacing was completely screwed; none of the characters had any depth; there was none of the political comment that made Brassed Off so interesting, and the acting was utterly, utterly dreadful.  What made Brassed Off so good was that all the characters had motivation and personality and all the squabbling competition was over something that the rest of the world would consider to be completely pointless.

Pete Postlethwaite did his best with what he was given; Sean Bean appeared to be trying; the Obligatory Feisty Bird should have been let loose on a grouse moor on the first day of the season and Craig Kelly...  *shudder*  He obviously didn't have a clue who his character was.  (Fair enough.  Neither did I.)

So, summary.  Kid wants to be a professional footballer.  Gets told not to be so bloody stupid - this is a northern town so he can either go down t'pit or go in t'factory.  Evil Father works down t'pit so kid goes to t'factory.  Ten years later, he's playing footie in the pub league and gets offered a chance to play for a semi-pro team.  Then he gets a trial for Sheffield Utd.  (Ferchrissake, he's _twenty-six_!  In pro football terms, he's approaching retirement age.)  Feisty Irish Bird tells him she's up the duff the night before the trial.  He promptly goes and gets pissed and fucks up the trial, after dumping Bird.

At which point, inevitably, there's trouble down t'pit and Beloved Brother gets killed.

Kid is remotivated, gets another trial, gets signed and gets Bird back.  Then, in his first match for Sheffield Utd (some semi-final against Man Utd), he scores the winning goal.  Hurrah, hurrah, much happiness.

"event","Blame <lj user=""sillypants"">.  I was just getting over my <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> kick when she mentioned Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole in her journal.  And then, of course, I start wondering about the actual historical basis of the film, which involves getting my grubby little paws on a copy of Lawrence's version of events.  (And resisting the urge to shell out ridiculous amounts of money on the 1922 text, with added words.)

Quite frankly, this book shouldn't be interesting.  Long descriptions of desert landscapes; pen portraits of people with unpronounceable names; descriptions of military tactics and strategies - none of them are really my thing.  And yet I'm having serious trouble putting this book down.

I admit, one of the things I love is where Lawrence's mode of speech comes through.  This is particularly noticeable in his responses to the proofreaders spelling queries.

Proofreader: Jeddah and Jidda used impartially throughout.  Intentional?

Lawrence: Rather!

P: Nuri, Emir of the Ruwalla, belongs to the 'chief family of the Rualla'.  One Slip 23 'Rualla horse', and Slip 38, 'killed one Rueli'.  In all later slips 'Rualla'.

L: Should have also used Ruwala and Ruala.

P: Jedha, the she-camel, was Jedhah on Slip 40.

L: She was a splendid beast.

P: 'Meleager, the immoral poet'.  I have put 'immortal' poet but the author may mean immoral after all.

L: Immorality I know.  Immortality I cannot judge.  As you please: Meleager will not sue us for libel.

Although it's destroying the film for me.  Next time I watch it, I'll be complaining that Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein wasn't on the ride to Akaba."

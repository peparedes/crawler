"event","It has been 18 weeks [End of May] since i last wrote anything in this blog. I'm going to attempt to revive it...again.We'll see how i far i get. 

The past four and a half months have been crazy,which is like an understatement of my year. I am currently refusing to talk about it. There is just no point. I was looking at past e-mail messages between Lauren and I last February. It was slightly amusing and irritating all at the same time. Don't you hate it when you give yourself good rational advice.Yet, You don't even listen/take it! It is so ironic. 

We haven't talked since September 13th. I think that was a wise move on my part.Probably one of the smartest moves i've yet to make with this whole thing. Though i pathetically still miss him. It'll be two months tomorrow since that fateful call in august. I don't know how i feel about that...

Anyway! I am currently not interested in either a relationship or anything of that sort. I've become slightly cynical. I just don't see the point? I think this is like the first time in my life where i can honestly say it and mean it. I do not want a boyfriend. 

I am shockingly enough keeping up with all the homework, so far. Along with also, filling out college applications and visiting colleges. I'm  going up to Seattle in november to visit the college there. That should be fun! I badly want senior year to go by quickly. Because i'm already getting quite bored and annoyed. But that in itself is another subject.."

"event","&nbsp;Hehehe....another beatle lyric for youuuuuuu... :P&nbsp;

So i'm finishing my blog update.Because. I kinda got distracted with the epic adventure story :P&nbsp;

So after we came back. Shortly after, William had to leave.So i walked him to his car.And we got distracted,basically catching up on everything.Because we hadnt talked in several days. Then Katie and Devin joined us. That was jolly.And now i have a secret i have to take to my death bed.HEHEHE :P Thenn....i left.Andd...Laura and Jin Woo came over and spent the night.We watched ""the ultimate gift"" which is a very good movie.Ate donuts and drank lemonade.It was fun. Laura and i stayed up till 2 talking.That was fun! We hadnt done that in quite some timeeeee.... :D&nbsp;

Saturday morning, They left early. I went back to bed.Slept for a couple hours more. Then the babies came over. That was fun. I was a GOOD aunt and played with&nbsp; isaak. Held jeni. I'm alittle scared about the whole helping isaak go to the bathroom. Yes. He is ALMOST finished being potty trained. But i'm like SO scared of him like FALLING into the toilet. Cuz of how skinny his little butt is. HEHE. I'm like constantly telling him to hold onto the edges of the toilet. lol. Anddd...i changed jeni's diaper. I havent had to do that in a veryyy long time! Considering. I like REFUSE to change isaak's diaper now that he is older. *shudders* Isaak, My mom, my sister,and I played a pretty hardcore game of Hide n Seek. lol. Jeni is getting SO big. It's kinda scary....... Anywhoooo.... I finally after alot of procrastinating finished my paper for&nbsp; Media and Culture! Yay! Though i do think...I&nbsp; am gonna do some fixes in it. And add a few more things. But for the most part it's finished!&nbsp;

Sunday..I slept. Got ready for the day. I tried calling nikki....butt..he was acting strange and was gonna call me back later. I dunno about him...lately....it's just been odd. And i've been strange about it. But anywhooo...Got ready for the concert. Basically. The concert was ah-MAZING! Though i was sad because this had been like the first concert that i'v been to that my ppl's havent been there. And it's just not the same without them. Butt..i did manage to have fun. LOL. To my sister&nbsp; worry-ment. I've decided i kinda like being friendly/flirty with strange boy(s).LOL. I basically think Reliant K was the BEST! :D I dont think they had a mosh pit going on. I dunnoo..but i just didnt feel brave enough to try to get in. I only really liked going into those&nbsp; when i was at REZ...and that was cuz i knew some of the boy's in it.And i trusted them.Knew i wasnt gonna get raped or anything.lol. I DID see tony! Butt..he was to far away. And i dont think he would have remembered me.Considering. I havent seen him in like a month. *shrugs* I bought some snazzy&nbsp; posters' and then left.&nbsp;

Today. I slept. Basically.Got zero hw done. Did some chores.Left for work. Basically...drowned in the rain. I REALLY need an umbrella. Work was long. I got into a mini fight with Ty. *sighs* I dunnoooo...Tis a tricky situation. But i made ammends. So yeah. I got sent home 30 minutes early.And..i think i got some brownie points from autumn tonight.yay!&nbsp;

Tomorrow is going to be interesting. I am apprehensive/excited. Because. I have to have a talk with ""him"". Orr...I might just not mention it at all. I dunnoooo....We'll see. Then i work. I wont be home till 8ish. Yay! :) Okay. 'Night!"

Soooo...We set off down the Jones's drive way.Discussing how messed up the&nbsp;LIGHTED horses' were.Sooo..of course we had to demonstrate how they were walking.&nbsp;Which was comical. :P People i'm sure if they saw us probably thought we were either demented or ON something.LOL. So we made our way&nbsp; down one side of the street.I was being quite friendly with the white line.....freaking katie out. Then, Me of course being emo and discussing how hillarious it would be to&nbsp; DIE from being hit by a car. Katie mentioned that people would think that *she* pushed me in front of the car that killed me. Sooo..i was like. Well..thenn..i just need to be&nbsp; alone and THEN get hit by a car THAT or...You have to die with me?!?!? LOL. And wouldnt that be hillarious?!? And by thenn..she moved me off&nbsp; the street&nbsp;and into the ditch.&nbsp;Then we stopped and just stood looking across the street at the pretty lights.Discussing, the colors, and how they didnt do it symetrical,OR put the star above baby jesus.Seriously.They FAILED basically, Putting up that nativity scene! We were both SUPER fascinated with the pretty lights that were around the entrance to this house.And i REALLY,REALLY wanted to skip down the lighted drive way.Butt...katie wouldnt let me. :( She thought we would&nbsp; get killed/raped/or something&nbsp;by the Buffalo men. hehehe. :P Me= Driveway tresspassing temptress!! LOL. &nbsp;By then. I really really had to pee. It was from that coffee of mine. Hehehe. And wow. That just made me even more hysterical...laughing at basically everythingggg...... Then i randomly mentioned about ""oh! there is a bush! hehehe..i could use that!"".&nbsp;""Fine. Go have your way with the bush.""-katie. And somehow....katie mentioned the story about Mose's and the fiery bush.""But remember, God works through bushes."" -Katie. And wouldnt THAT be a twist in that story...about how he PUT the fire out.Which....made our minds go down the gutter. Us laughing basically hysterical! I basically...couldnt stop laughing....And then we skipped our way back down the drive way to the jones's house. The END!&nbsp; IGH"

"event","Hehehehe...Wow. I am like now in love with the beatles. I think it's cuz their music&nbsp;is SO refreshing compared to the music of today.So I had to write this paper for media and culture about a band that has influenced our culture.And&nbsp;after seeing the preview of ""Across the Universe"" which i still REALLY want to see. I was like Hm. I&nbsp;am gonna write about them.So i like know ALL&nbsp;about them.Hehehe..&nbsp;And rachael (co-worker) who is like obsessed with them, i told her that i was doing a paper about them.Anddd..so she was like ""KATE! Your really need to watch their movies!!"" And she had them.Andd....sooo..i watched one of them tonight and one today.They are amusing to say the least. They make me laugh....Anddd...John Lennon is CUTE! I'm sorry. Back in the early 60s he was&nbsp; a cutie! Anddd...now i have their music stuck in my head for the past 48 hours?!? LOL.&nbsp;

Anywho!!! I have to leave for work soon. But i thought i would TRY finishing this entry.Cuz i actually wrote the first part yesterday afternoon but didnt have enough time to finish it. :(&nbsp;

Friday was a very...bad....day.LOL. But it ended GOOD! So that's all that matter's. It was basically one of those days that kate was SUPER emotional! I havent cried that much for no apparent reason in a VERY long time! LOL. So basically. I had an app. with this guy about possibly volunteering at the place where my mom works.And my dad WAS gonna take me and then at the&nbsp; last moment he couldnt. I didnt know it. Andd...i basically there was no time to take the bus.And so i had to call and cancel. And make a new app. It was pretty EPIC! And. I just REALLY wished i had my license and my car. But whatever. I instead went over to volleyball class. Cuz i just HAD to get out of the house. I think i would have ended up doing something violent. That was fun. Saw jolly ppl :D Then. I went home. I did some hw. Basically caught up on all my hw which made me happpyyyy :D So bible study was HILLARIOUS! I was in a gooood mood! And i suddenly became a few ppl's bff which was fascinating to say the least. William came that was FUN! :D The worship wasn't the best. I've had better worship times. I think it's cuz i didnt know/like any of the songs. Which put a damper on that.And the message i just was SO distracted and i still have no idea what he talked about, which is baddd! lol.&nbsp;

Okay.So basically me and katie went on this ADVENTURE.Anddd...it was HILLARIOUS! Andd..there were probably a TON of funny quotes.Except i cant remember like any of them.Which is lame.I told katie she should blog about it. But she told me *i* had too. So i'm gonna TRYY very hard to like write down our epic adventure.Katie,You MUST help me with thisssssss....&nbsp;
So katie really really really wanted me to go see this x-mas lights that were across the street. So we set off to go see them..........

Ugghhh....andd..i have to go to work now. LAME! To be continued....LOL."

"event","Wow. I had the&nbsp;most annoying song stuck in my head.....the song by feist.I basically hate it with a fiery passion.There is NO point to it! Thankfully.&nbsp; I now have a new song stuck in my head. I have ZERO idea when i blogged last.Which is lame. And i'm falling asleep at the moment.Which is bad. Hopefully. I'll be somewhat coherent through this whole post.If not. Then my appologies. :P I'll just edit it later.heheheh.&nbsp;

&nbsp;So sunday was long. VERY long. I reallyyyyyy hate working 8 hour shifts. I have worked 29 hours these past 4 days. I think that should be illegal. ""Pretty much"" So sunday. I got SOC-ed.Which i have NO idea what it means.LOL. It's basically an acronymn for something important at work. I have TRIED figuring out what it means.From&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it being SUPER dirty to very professional names. AHAHA.Basically cole pwned me. Jenni (my manager)&nbsp;asked us these different official questions&nbsp;about&nbsp;&nbsp;how to handle/do things at work.And i failed. LOL. Well.Not really.Just more like blanked out.And cole who got like hired LAST week. Got most of the questions right compared to me who has been in mcdonald land forEVER. I think what it really comes down to is that i dont like ""remember"" all these ridiculse proper procedures and junk. I just KNOW it and KNOW what to do in a situation and almost all of it. I do automatically. To be asked on the spot. I'm like ""uhhh..yeahhh.....mmm....""&nbsp;lolol. But i still got SOC-ed, because jenni knew i knew it. Yay! For finally getting stickers on my badge!&nbsp;&nbsp;

Monday. I got called into work early.And somehow they managed to squeeze an extra hour out of me. I'm not sure what happened monday. I think that's the day that autumn decided she hated me?!!??&nbsp;

Tuesday was pretty much AMAZINGGG...except the whole having to take the bus to school in the morning.Thankfully.I did not have any issues on it. lol. Nothing amusing happened till lunch time. Wow.Seriously. I'm realizing i have to be VERY careful who i tell ppl things.I told something to someone.Next thing i knew.ALL the girls knew! I was like AHHH!!! This is awwkkkwarddddddddd....So i just kept disappearing. I dont like to be pushed/watched/forced to do something. Not my thing. So basically.I was SUPER happy&nbsp;after that&nbsp;and was STILL in a good mood&nbsp;even at work.Ohhh..and nick called me at school.&nbsp;That was interesting *sighs*&nbsp;I dunno. *puzzled* The boys&nbsp;teased me about him.Goshhhh..nick is just nick. That's it.End of story!&nbsp;LOL. Math was funnn..i was in a weird giggly mood. I think it was from all that caffeine. I took the bus over to work. Ran into Ty(from work) and we walked over to winco,got food,and talked before work.It was fun. Oh.Like i said. I was in a prettyyy amazing-ly good mood. Sooo..of course....i DID&nbsp;get&nbsp; teased about me being in a good mood. They were like ""kate! Stop thinking about *deletes name*!"" *shy*&nbsp;
So basically. I like did some MAJOR cleaning in the front drive thru.Basically,getting ready for corporate the next day. I felt very proud after i was finished :D&nbsp;

So today was actually not that traumatic. I was SOOOO traumatized about corporate coming. I didnt sleep very good and took forever to fall asleep. Basically, I wanted to run away FAR away. Corportate coming meant basicallyyyyy.... Things were gonna be very&nbsp;stressful. I was possibly gonna have one of my ""off days"". Get yelled at. Just want to find some corner and cry.LOL. Butttt.....it was okay. I was super freaked out though.Theresa who i'm like SO scared of was REALLY nice to me today. I was like ""wheeee"". And i havent done breakfast menu in like a month or two.She wanted to put me on front counter.Which i was like ohhhh..noooo...they are going to TIME me! And of course someone is gonna want a special sandwhich.And i'm going to DIEEEEE!!!!! AHHHH!!! &nbsp;And so she realized i was un-comfortable doing front counter.Duh.So she was like okay. Kate. You are going to stock instead. I was like YAYYY!!!!!!! So that's what i did. For like an hour and half till lunch time. :D So we did good on like everything being timed,efficient,and doing everything the ""proper way"". And so yeah. I didnt get off till 5.Bleh.But i dont go into work again till monday! Ye-AH! :D And i'm off to bed. Hopefully.You were able to follow what i said.&nbsp; :P"

"event","<p>Oh.Wow.*distressed* Soooooo...I dyed my hair AGAIN tonight. Anddd...its DARK. Super dark.And i dont think i like it. Or more like it's gonna take me awhile to get use to it being dark-ish. But i greatly needed to dye it.It was turning into this sicky yellow-ish color. Which was super annoying.. So yes.Kate is no longer a blonde!!!! Yayyy! LOL. So right now. I am waiting for Nick to call me. But i kinda dont think he is gonna tonight. *sighs* It's otay. I will call him 2morow. :D&nbsp;<br /><br />Much later............<br />He DID call me.And we talked for like 30 minutes. That was fun! :D He makes me laugh....lotssss..&nbsp;<br /><br />Okay.So this past wednesday was very long. I accidentally over slept. Then had like a ton of things to do before i could leave the house.Soooo..i missed the bus that i wanted to be on.Basically.I didnt get to be at HS during lunch time.Which was good and bad. But i got my room cleaned,my bed stripped,things put away,and got ready for the day.Eventually. I made my way over to school. I had GREAT issue's talking.Which was bad. Anddd..yeahhhh.....Never telling soren who i like AGAIN! Wow. Though. I didnt TECHINCALLY tell him. He just guessed right.lol. Sooo..nowww...he just wont stop teasing me about it. gosh! Caught the bus going to work.Dropped my stuff at work. Basically.Felt like i was moving into work. No joke. Considering that i now have to take the bus to go to school and work. And I'm not wanting to go home after school and then go home. Cuz it's basically way to much wasted time. I now have to bring my work clothes.Which is annoying.Cuz i HAVE to take a ton of school books,my purse,and then a BIG bag that contains my work clothes.Tis annoying.So yes. Anywho. Trotted over to the library and found books for my paper for Media and Culture class. I guess i'm doing my paper about the beatles. I feel kinda inspired by them to write a paper about them. Then found some other jolly reading books.Which made me happppyyy...so to add on TOP of my school books,purse,work clothes,and then like 10 library books. I was like WOW. I am most definitly moving into work now. LOL. OHHHHH!!! And i saw my "" i want an 18 year old"" guy. HEHEHEH......We walked to work together.Though he didnt say ANYTHING to me. But i just stared at him..... He's soooooo cute! Though! I couldnt help myself.LOL. Work was long. I got stuck in back booth AGAIN for 7 hours. Basically went insane. Randy though amuses me BEYOND words. My whole...""wheeeeeeee....you look sad. You need a....HUG!!! :D :D :D"" has rubbed off on him.Which is QUITE comical. So now he is like...""kateee...do you need a hug?!?"" LOL. I'm like yeahhh... about that. LOL.&nbsp;<br />I didnt get to go to bed till like 2ish.Because my mom and i went down to the bus station to pick up my brother.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Thanksgiving was AMAZINGGGG! There were basically zero stressful times/drama.Which was GOOD! We all sat around the family table like old times. *sighs* Buttt...It just wasnt the same. And i dont think it will ever be the same. I highly doubt it. *sighs* Isaak was our mode of entertainment. LOL. He's seriously like the energizer bunny. No joke! We all stuffed ourselves beyond compacity.Took a bunch of family pictures. Then Bekah and Kris left with the the babies.And we all went to go see ""the Martian Kid"" which was a pretty good movie! Came home.Ate some more. Watched some pretty lame-o movies. My dad just doesnt have any good movie picking&nbsp;skills.&nbsp;Then everyone went to bed.Except me and dave. We watched ""The contract"" which i didnt care for.Way to much melodrama that just went on and on and on. I was like ""OKAY! If you gonna kill them.Just DO it.And get it over with! Gosh!!!"" Then we watched the newest James Bond movie. By then we were almost passed out on the floor feeling sick cuz of all that food we ate. LOL. Wayyyy....to many inside jokes we shared in that movie! LOL.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then friday. I just slept in till like 12ish. hehehe. I've been SOOO cold the past couple nights.Because i've had to sleep in hannah's room on the air mattress.I found out today. That air mattress's do NOT trap heat in. So your always be cold. BUT! If you put a sleeping back like on top of it. It will work better at trapping in the heat. I'm like thanks! NOW! You tell me of course. After, I'm done sleeping like that the past couple nights. But.Now i get to sleep in my lovely bed of happiness and joy tonight :D ANYWAY! Back to friday.&nbsp;So finallyyy...after being SUPER lazy.We went and picked up my mommie. I left a note for keith. He's still avoiding me. :( Then hit the mall to do some shopping.It's SOO amusing to go to out in public with my brother. Because.Oh.Wow. ALL these girls like being completely ridiculse checking him out. I'm like AHAHA.Stop embarressing yourself,dearie! He's just a LITTLE to old.Thank.you.very.much! I bought a couple snazzy shirts. Left.Rented movies.Came home. Ordered pizza in. Went and picked it up. Played games while eating pizza.Then watched movies. I do NOT approve of "" I now pronounce you chuck and larry"" but it was STILL quite HILLARIOUS! Annnddd..yeaahhhh...i do NOT recomment seeing ""28 weeks later"" THE most freakiest movie that i have EVER watched in my life.*greatly traumatized* Which in turn i couldnt sleep till like 3:30ish/4 before i fell asleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;This morning. Dave left. *tears* I slept in late-ish after of course saying goodbye/hugs and all that stuff :) Twas lazy till tonight. Then ran some errands.And this is a very long&nbsp;post.So i'm done&nbsp;postingggg...........<br /><br />The End.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","AHHHHH!!!!! I HATE making important phone calls. It traumatizes me. GREATLY! Wahhhhhhh.....lol. Keith doesnt want to talk to me. *tears* :( lolol. But yeah. I am procrastinating about studying for my spanish test and doing any math. So thought i would blog.Yay!&nbsp; 

So basically. I am a horrible sister. Yeahhhhhh...something like that. Kinda confused. But. Yeah. My sister is ""upset"" or something at me. Older one that is. But it doesnt really shock/bother me.Considering i probably do nothing right in her eye's ANYWAY! lol. So basically i have issue's.Cuz i think sleeping is just a LITTLE bit more important then being social in the morning with her and kids. I'm like ""i'm sowwwwwyyy..butttt..i HEART sleeping!""And i'm selfish.The end. :P&nbsp;Lately. It just seem's like i dont get enough sleep. So yes. I REALLY just think if she is gonna come over she should come over for dinner. That would be amazing! But i am gonna TRY. REALLY hard to get up early in the morning.When she is over. To be social. :D But yes. I slept into like 12ish. Did ""things"". I'm not really sure what i did.......Just KNOW that i did SOMETHING.Which was alot better then last saturday.Which i just slep the day away.lol. Yeahhh..bad habbit! Ohhhhh...i got invited to go someplace and play halo.But i couldnt.wahhhhh...Which was mildly depressing. But instead, We went and got groceries and did other random stuff.&nbsp;Ohhhh...Girl's at winco.Are wow. DEMENTED!!! I'm sorry. I was SOO disturbed about what they were doing. It was like. They were&nbsp;ON something!!! LOL. No joke!&nbsp; 

Sundayyy was AMAZINGGGG....we went and visited Laura's church. That was jolly. I heart their worship.One of the songs they sang was one that i learned at the ground floor. Which made me think about daniel crawford. I had happy thoughts.:D *pats danny* &nbsp;I miss that boy! *sighs* The message was...........okay. Then my family and i went to go look at furniture which was&nbsp; pointless! Considering, my mom is like&nbsp; WORST then me making decisions.So no furniture for usss...saddnessss... Then we went to&nbsp; mickey d's and i made their life difficult.Cuz i wanted a ""special"" sandwhich.hehehe :P Then off we went to laura's housefor her party. That was jolly. It amuses me how MUCH i feel comfortable in their house. Probably has to do with how long i stayed with them this past spring. But yeah. Connor was knocking at the door. I pranced over and opened it.And was like ""HI!!!!!! I dont live here. But come on in :D"" Poor connor.&nbsp;The time changed for laura's party it WAS gonna be at 2ish and then it got changed to 3.And.Of courses connor didnt listen to the answering machine after coming home from church.And so His(your) dad brought him out.And no one was there.And so had to go BACK into town..and came out again at 3.Twas sadddd...;(

Wow.Okay. I am finishing this post that&nbsp;I&nbsp; wrote this yesterday afternoon. I have no idea where i was going with the whole ""party"" thing. But ANYWHO! Jsyk.Katie. I changed my display picture JUST for you.Now you can have dream's about THAT!!! LOL ;)&nbsp;

Yesterday. I had an ortho app. I am SOOOO hoping/praying.That i get my brace's off my next app in december!!!!!! That would be AMZINGGGG..We'll see. :P &nbsp;I went to HS.It was rainingg..and i got really wet. Took my spanish test.And got a A- on it.Which made me HAPPY :D Went to work.Work was soooooo slowwwww...And i got stuck doing back booth.Which is no longer a challenge for me.Instead SUPER easy! And i have no patience for customer's. So i was feeling SUPER lazy.Wasnt much to do.We were slow.And so i watched wheel of fortune on the Tv in the break room with my feet propped up on a chair.Till a customer pulled up into the drive thru. Even then. I could continue sitting there taking the order.Cuz i have like all the prices memorized in my head.Very pathetic. lol.Till.They of course pulled up to pay.Then i had to ring it up quickly.&nbsp;

Today. My mommie had to go to work early.Meaning that me and hannah had to take the bus.Bleh. And that was just epic. Though i DID see Laura Sumstine on it.That was jolly.So we talked the whole way to HS on the bus. Till we suddenly came to the stop outside of hs. Then the epic-ness began! Soooo... I had to take my back pack,purse,i had multiple books in my hand, ipod,anddddd......a big bag with work clothes in it.Cuz i had to go from school to work. Andd...basicallyyyy..i had issue's.Which consisted of me spilling all my books out of my backpack.Going EVERYWHERE! The door's closingg..me FREAKING out.Cuz i thought they were gonna leave the bus stop!&nbsp; I'm like AHHHHH......Finally. Managed to grab everything.And make my way out of the bus door. Super TRAUMATIZED! But yeah. *whew* I made it to class.That is all that matter's :P Ohhhh...and Micah's little sister has like randomly started talking to me. Which is fascinating.Considering that i have never really introduced myself nor talked to her really. Kinda confused how she know's my name. Hmmm...

Spanish was boring...blah,blah. I got hardly any math done in lab. I ate pizza in lab. I ""talked"" to katie. Danced in the sun with Emily :P Talked some more. Talked to..........""him"" :D Which made me happy :D Then me and the ""boys"" went to putter's. I got teased ALOT about who i like. LOL.Which i dont approve of. lol. Got alittle math done. Argued with them all that...men are really not 100% men. But more like 58% men.Till they get married.And women COMPLETE them.lol. But i refuse to believe that women are only 42%.We are more like...82% :D Yep,yeppp.....:P Then i called Ashley up to wish her a happy birthday and catch up with her.That was amazingg...i think the boy's thought i was talking to a male ""friend"" or something.hehehe.. So beforehand.We were talking about lot's of things. One being about girl's HATING to be called fat or ugly or something by a guy. I'm like DUHHH..that's SOOO&nbsp; mean! Cuz as much as we hate it.We LIKE having the approval from guy's about how we look.Er...something like that. And of course they had to argue about it with me.Cuz i used the word ""depressed."" So i had to have james lecture me about it's their OWN fault about being depressed.Not us guy's....blah,blah. Which was stupid.Of course. So while i was on the phone. Soren TRIED to talk to me while i was talking on the phone. I'm like come on hereeee.....i'm ON the phone! sheash! Finally. I was like WHAT?!? He was like. ""Well.We have decided. Instead of calling you fat?!? Your beautiful!"" I'm like uhhhhhhh...ohhhh..ummm... LOL. awwwww.....thanksss..guysss...:D *and walked away quickly still talking on the phone* So math was okay.&nbsp;

Then i was able to get a ride to work from Mrs.Nott.Work was long. I got stuck in back booth AGAIN. I think randy hates me. I got SUPER frustrated at customer's.Basically.They have no placing order skills. Then i basicallyyyyyyyy...SNAPPED at Wes. He was yelling/wining/complaining about me doing my job slow?!?! And. He just basically rub's me the wrong way. I told him to knock it off. Just me a second.Gosh. Not being very understanding. Which was a bad move.Cuz i gave him ammunition to fight back.So he pushed my button JUST right. And i just flew off the handle! I havent gotten that upset in like a long time. I think he was surprised by my reaction. Considering. I try REALLY hard not to swear/get mad at ppl at work or anyone/anywhere for that matter. Cuz it's REALLY easy for&nbsp; me to do it. But he&nbsp;told &nbsp;me i was acting like &nbsp;a B****. I was like ""WHAT THE HECK!?!??&nbsp; This?!? This is NOT me being a B****!!!!!!

"event","&nbsp;Hehehe..Okay. I told katie i was going to blog...again.So i am. But it basically would be like.......

""eeeeeeeee....AHHH....hmmm...BLEHH!. Bah! GR! Humph. gahhhhhh....FINE! Okay.bye."" Cuz word's cant describe tonight. Lol. Basically.&nbsp;
Wow. Leo (my ipod) &nbsp;is annoying me sooo badly. It confuses me. It totally SHUFFLED my music on my playlist.So now i cant find any of my favorite songs are. *annoyed*&nbsp;

Anyway. I.....overslept this morning.And so was twenty minutes late for work. :( Which isnt good. Work was okay. Very long as usual. Oh! This was funny.So this guy came in with a bunch of his girly friends.He looked/reminded me of Matt (my ex-hubby) SOOO much. Like the whole trying to grow a beard thing. tehehe :P It amused me immensly! And then he was a complete tease which also reminded me of matt immensly. I asked him what i could get him.He was like...."" an 18 year old!"" *wink wink* lol. I was like LOL. ""uh..yeah. Can NOT help you there!"" LOL. I also called nikki while on break. That was jolly.He was preparing food for shushi night at his house. I was like ""wahhhhhhh...i SOOOOO want to be there tonight! *tears*""&nbsp;
&nbsp;It's odd. &nbsp;I feel like my life has shocking-ly gotten better the past 24 hours. Feeling super content. And like okay with a ton of things.That use to bother me.And now. Im like ""hmmm...welll..whatever :p"" At like 5 at night.Work got CRAZY-ily hectic. I got stuck on doing fry's. But then got out of having to do it to ""run"". Then drive thru got back uped to that gas station. I was like ""mmm.....yeahhhh...we need to get this clear ,randy. Want to go four drive?"" So i got to take order's which made me happy. Twas a LOT better then yucky fry's. Till it was like WAY past 6. I was like Yep. I am leaving. Goodbye! Hurried home.Got cleaned up. Went to bible study. Was 40 minutes late.&nbsp;
Bible study was like yeah. Word's cant describe it. Basically. So i'm just not. Just that someone need's prayer badly....Andddd...... I feel like i became better friends with someone.Which i'm not sure so sure about............. &nbsp;&nbsp;But it's nice to feel needed :) And we'll see how things go next week at school. I just REALLY hope i'm not dragged into that drama. I.refuse. I had to deal with that this past spring. I refuse to give into that again. Just say no to drama! And nick called me...again. Anddd..then william like called me 3? 4 times? Tonight. We basically played phone tag the whole night. Lol. And it's late. I really think i want to go to bed.Think happy thoughts and read my new amazing book.That makes me happy.

Oh.Random thought.So late one night like last weekend. I found these thingy's online about reading the bible in one year.And so i printed them off.And so I have been diligently reading my bible every night. And i have TWO more day's left till i have finished this week.Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That makes me SOO happy!!!! That's probably the reason why i feel content :D Okay.Leaving..now. yay?"

"event","&nbsp; Hehehe...My icon amuses me SO much! Remind's me of nick :D Wow. Lately everything seem's to remind me of either nick or another REV person. I think i'm getting another bout of homesick-ness. Bleh. Anywho. I'm super tired. *yawns*. I really should go to bed. But feel zero motivation to do so.&nbsp;

So this wednesday. I got lot's of sleep! I heart my new pillow.Wow. It's amazing. Got ready for the day. I decided to go over to HS.&nbsp; My voice was pretty much close to being shot. I came to the conclusion that i would DIEEEEEEE. If i couldnt talk.Wowww.... ""Pretty much"".lol. And trying to&nbsp;talk LOUD with no voice.Is.Impossible. Basically comes out&nbsp;like loud ""eeeeeeeek"" noice with&nbsp;zero words in it. lol. Which oddly remind's me of marjorie.She cracks me up. Anywho! &nbsp;Made my way over to the bus.Somehow i missed read the bus schedule.Was like 5 minutes early.Which was annoying. But least it was &nbsp;better then being 5 minutes late. lol. And&nbsp;&nbsp;possibly getting hit by a car while&nbsp;being an idiot&nbsp;crossing the street.&nbsp;Seriously. I HIGHLY predict that i'm gonna die by getting hit by a car .LOL.Ohhhhhh... &nbsp;I saw forrest on the bus.That was just awkwarddddd... He probably thinks i hate him or something.Cuz i was like yeah. I am half asleep and do NOT feel like talking. The end. Hung out at HS. Gave Kevin his new lighsaber. *rolls eyes* Don't ask. I've decided that i like lightsaber's. they are PERFECT for hitting ppl over the head with. More so effective then slapping.heheheh :P I was planning on getting some sort of hw done. But yeah.That didnt happen obviously.So instead got talked into going to burrito's amigo's.No.More like i decided to go there first and then SOMEONE decided to follow me. Then we made it be a group outing. :D&nbsp; Then..... i got talked into going to&nbsp; putter's with kevin and soren.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm starting to feel a LITTLE disturbed by how many time's i'm like the ONLY girl in a group of guys.&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear i do NOT do it on purpose.It just happens. *chuckles* Especially disturbed by getting these random boyfriend comments. Yeahhhh.... Not so sure about&nbsp; that one. Was new, new's to me :P&nbsp;

&nbsp;So after 1ish. My mommie and my sister came and picked me up.And we went shopping.I spent WAY to much money as usual.Trying not to think about it at the moment. lol. But i had to buy two birthday gift's.That was just stress-full! I finally figured out what to get after like forEVER. Basically.Very epic. But i got new clothes.Yayyy :D *happiness* After like i dont know, 4 hours of shopping? We finally came home. I did a bunch of hw! Thought about calling nick. But was feeling little motivation. I really hate calling&nbsp;his house. I'm like traumatized by past experiances,hehe ;P So instead talked to William.And stayed up late and did random things online. Then kinda went to bed. But instead did like a ton of hw in bed. Like studying for my spanish test.I feel alittle confident about taking it. yay?!&nbsp;
Basically. Did not sleep very good at night. I kept tossing and turning and waking up. I would not be surprised if i slept walked too. Oddly enough. Lately. I've been sleeping walking quite a bit.Which is kinda freaking me out.Considering i thought i had gotten over that habbit.Apparently not.&nbsp;But it's a sign that something is bothering me.Duh. Obviously. 

Today was long. I really wanted to skip spanish and go back to bed.But i was good.And went to class. Somehow got through it and media and culture.&nbsp;Though that class was oddly amusing while watching elvis presley video clips and other music clips of old singer's.&nbsp;Then after class i made my way over to putter's.Cuz i didnt have a lunch wanted pizza.Woww...i've decided i approve of putter's especially going there alone.LOL. Then after awhile...Devin joined me.And we kinda got through a lesson of math. James was SUPPOSE to come over.But he didnt.Lame-o. Math was.... idk. Long. I kinda blocked it out. I was too busy texting ppl.*shy* I WAS&nbsp; paying attention most of the time. Swing was amusing...we learned how to do lifts. AHAHAH...That was awkward. Just cuz..yeahhh.. Never minddd.. I made a new friend in swing class.Which is jolly :D She's awesome :D *pats katherine*&nbsp;
So a group of us went and saw ""the seeker"" tonight. It was fun but also very interesting-ly/fascinating-ly/awkward. The end. I dont think i approve of Connor sitting on devin's lap.............. ROFL.&nbsp;

Then. Nick called me tonight.That basically made my night :D Considering i've been really worried and concerned about him lately. He's done this to me before. Which wow. Annoy's me sooooo much! Especially.Since i cant see him and like slap some sense into him.LOL. But i did have a good reason for being worried and concerned. *sighs* &nbsp;And yeah. He's changed these past couple of months.Which i dont think for the best. I guess he is getting ""older"" but yeah. He is changing the thing that makes him nick. That makes me sad. *sighs* Wowww..time's like these. I REALLY wished i lived back in michigan! :(&nbsp;But yeah.We talked for alittle less then 2 hours. Which was jolly though :D &nbsp;So i think.Things are good between us again. So yes. He and i are moving to england.Setting up house together.And i'm gonna be his spinster ""sister"".Help him find a nice,cute, english, girly friend. Tehehehe&nbsp;:D&nbsp;There was actually a few different scenario's about what would happen. But i liked this one the best. I do not approve of going to his island. LOL. 

So tommorow. I work 8 hours from like 10ish to 6. Which is gross. So i'm gonna be most likely 30 minutes late to bible study.: / Well. I am gonna go to bed. 'night!"

"event","&nbsp;HEHEHEHEH...So this is gonna be a VERY short post. But i had to post it.Wow. So yeah. Last at work....... i got egged. Yesssss.....That's correct.Egged! I was doing single booth by myself and had opened the window to get the customer's money.When these teenage boys threw EGG'S at me and the customer. So there were egg's all over the customer's car,herself,on the ground,on the building, and ALL over me! LOL. Thankfully. When i saw fling's flying at me. I instinictly stepped back.The window slammed closed and got most of it. But i still had quite a bit in my hair and all over the back of my shirt. Shockingly enough. I thought it was pretty darn HILLARIOUS. Everyone else was like ""grrrr"" even though they werent the ones who got egg's thrown at. I was like ""hehehehehe."" :P Basically. That made my night. So i wined enough and i was able to get off work 30 minutes early. But..we were also REALLY slow.So they were like ""whatever."" Go home.Go get cleaned up. Anddd..got free food.For being HARRESSED by egg's :D I heart randy and peter :D Hopefully.....when i got into work tonight. There will no longer be any trace's of the eggy smell outside of drive thru.... *finger's crossed* :)"

"event","&nbsp;<font size=""1"">Wow. I am having a super fascinating conversation with Joel. Im not sure what to think about this. Second time he has kinda asked me out. I'm like ""uhhhhhhh..."" *changes subject* Poor guy :(&nbsp; The stalker count though has moved UP! Which is kinda scary. Makes me really want to have a bf to scare them awayyyy.. Yep,yep.&nbsp; My font is small.And i like it. Makes me feel...happy.So i basically un-packed the last box tonight of my stuff. I was like Yayyyy..Now im officially moved in...lol. Alittle delayed.But oh well :P That's how i roll.<br /><br />&nbsp;Tuesday. Was bleh I overslept. So had to take the bus.Missed the bus. Begged my mom to take me to school.Felt like crying.And was 30 minutes late for class. Got pretty frustrated in Spanish. It annoys me to no end.That i'm told one thing to do for hw.And basically trying to cram in ALL this hw.Then go to class.Find out oh.No. You werent suppose to do that.Gosh...didnt i tell you to do this instead.Nooooooo....... I got pretty frustrated with ""ppl"". After feeling pretty emo during lunch. Devin,James,Soren and I WERE gonna go to the library and work on math hw. But of course. It was closed.So went to putter's instead.Certain annoymous ppl showed up. Which was kinda good and bad. Basically annoyed some of us.Considering they werent really invited. But the BIG thing.Was that they were SKIPPING class! While we werent. So yeah. Whatever. We played on the play ground, played video games, and ate food.Basically got NOTHING done. But&nbsp;it was funnnnn...:) &nbsp;But next week we are gonna be more focused! lol. I also worked tuesday. Not sure what happened&nbsp;tuesday.Something probably un-exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;Wednesdayyyy...I overslept majorly. Missed the book club.Which i felt pretty awful. Anddd...sooo..since laura now has her license.She is no longer my bus buddy.Which is kinda depressing :( So she just drove over to my house.And we hung out.Went to the little caesar's and got yummy pizza. Saw the ""pizza man"" he crack's me up.lol. Okay.Wowww...wednesday night was pretty much THE most AWFUL-est night that i have ever worked in my LIFE! BASICALLY! First) It was halloween which equalled we were gonna be SLAMMED all night long. Two) of course didnt have enough ppl or skilled ppl. Third) only one manager.Known to go into hysteric's sometimes.So with all of that. Our grill ppl got confused that night.And accidentally had the grill screen on ""recall"".So no NEW order's were being shown.Only old ones. So they were making all the SAME food,over,and over again. And at that exact moment.We got SLAMMED.And so we were screwed for like an hour or two. Not sure what to do. And customer's waiting like 20 minutes for their food.And getting SUPER ticked off at us.And we couldnt figure out what to do. Then William and Aaron show up to visit me. I'm like greatttttttt...perfect timing. Right when i feel like jumping off a bridge. *whew* Yeah. Alittle traumatized. Thank goodness i didnt work thursday. Lol.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thursday.William visited school all day.Cuz springfield had thursday and friday off&nbsp;of school.So that was fun. Spanish was boring. I'm gonna fail media and culture.Also very boring. We went to Putter's for lunch.That was jollyyyy..I am working on my driving skills on ""the fast and the furious"" heheheheheh... Second time there at Putter's that we've had THE ""talk"". LOL. I'm like ""Hmmm...i'm not so sure about this."" heheheh. At swing.I was the THE male. I was like.....""zachhh....so am i MALE?!?"" lol. I actually like being male better then follower. I am way to.... independent to let some male decide what to do with me. AHAHA.And that sounded wrong. All in pure thoughts. Honest. I then went to go see ""dan in real life"" with my aunt and sister.That was jollyyy :D Buttt..i am VERY scared of my aunt's driving.Seriously. I KNOW that i'm gonna die in a car accident with her. Wowww...basically. *traumatized*&nbsp;<br /><br />Friday. I met the owner of like ALL the mcdonald's in the area. That was...SUPER traumatizing. I was like a rabbit trapped in a hole. Anyway.She asked me a BILLION questions. Thankfully i didnt vocally freak out. Calmly answered them. Like she told me that Char (my old boss) GREATLY recommended me.Sung my praises. I was like ""hmm.that's nice."" Asked LOTS of question's about the coffee machine that we had in michigan.And since i WAS hired to be their barista. I DO know alot about it.After trying to get plausible answer's to the questions. And she was like ""yeahhh....sooo..we are getting that in June. And So *you'll* be able to help us out with THAT!""&nbsp;*thinking* ahahaha..... a year that i'm still gonna be there? I think not! Then the usual question.Why did you move here??!!? I think everyone think's we moved here cuz we are running from the law or something.SERIOUSLY! LOL. Then the question's ENDED! Yay! &nbsp;Except she WATCHED me alot..and looked over my shoulder when i took order's. I was like ""justttttt...keep breathing!"" hehe.&nbsp;<br />So autumn (My boss) asked me if i could work the 28th of november.It'll be a SUPER long shift.And i was like ""ummm..okay. Yeah. i think i can do that."" Then theresa came up and asked me if i was gonna do it. Gave&nbsp; her the same answer. Finally. I ask Randy what is SO special about the 28th! Seriously?!? And he tell's me that. Corporate which is basically the "" BIG BOSSES"" in mcdonald world is visiting our store on the 28th.And that autumn and theresa are ONLY wanting SPECIAL and SKILLED ppl to work that day. I was like ""wheeeee..and i got picked!. I was like .."" Randdyyy.. what if i have a REALLY bad day.And like FAIL at what i do. LOL. Would they fire me?!!??"" Him..""umm..no."" me...""DARN!"" lol. Him,,,""well..depends on what you did."" hehe :P&nbsp;<br /><br />Bible study was okay. I had a good long talk with sophia andd...kinda with laura. Me and Jessica practiced our swing routine.That was jollyyyy...&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday. I slept in late. And then went over to William's for a Halo party? That was fun. Though i THOROUGLY suck at playing that game! lol. Played halo. We went&nbsp;over to roaring rapids and ate pizza. Game back. Played halo. Katie had to leave. Then went for a walk.Then my mommie was&nbsp;there to pick me up.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />the end. <br /><br /></font>&nbsp;"

"event","Hehehe....I like this song. Though it's SUPER emo. Makes me&nbsp;depressed. I&nbsp;always think of adam when i&nbsp;listen to this song. It's fascinating.&nbsp; 
Anywho! So i'm procrastinating about doing any sort of hw. I have been working on spanish hw for like two hours.And i'm not even CLOSE to being done.Soooo...gay! I'm like in a shocking-ly good mood right now. I think it's gonna get ruined tonight. Cuz i work another 3:30-10 tonight. Joy. Buttttt...Since i've been moaning and complaining about work lately. I'm realizing it's just cuz i'm feeling&nbsp;VERY dis-content with life lately.And i'm taking it out on work. *pat's work* &nbsp;So... i either need to suck it up.Cuz working will never be fun or else just get it over with. QUIT! And apply somewhere else. But i'm thinking that i'm gonna look into applying at like Izzy's or else Sherrie's or something :)&nbsp; 

BUT! I was talking to my mom last night about ""life"".Well..that is life AFTER highschool. And i kinda have a PLAN! It's kinda exciting!&nbsp; *glee* So i'm planning on going to europe the summer before college.I could even go to india if i REALLY wanted too.Cuz i got family there. :D That'd be kinda hardcore.Not sure if i could take it though.hmmm.... Then i just need to decide if i really want to go to washington univeristy in seattle or else go to OSU. I REALLY want to live out of state. I think. Buttt... I'm kinda thinking that i want to live at home for a couple years.That way i could possibly afford doing some traveling. Then maybe transfer to washington university for my third and fouth year.Either move in with dave or elseeeee... get my own apartment :) &nbsp;AND! I'm FORSURE going into medical. Some sort of therapy either phsyical or mental therapy. lol.&nbsp;I basically decided i was going into therapy like&nbsp;SEVERAL months ago.But my mom apparently still had it stuck in her brain that i was still&nbsp;thinking about going into&nbsp;education. I was like ""uhhhh..NO!"". So!&nbsp;&nbsp;my mom is gonna call sacred heart hospital one of these day's and see about possibly having them give me a tour of some of the different fields at the hospital.AND! Volunteering&nbsp; during x-mas break. :D&nbsp; 


Anddddd.....I'm leaving.I am off to go get my paycheck and do some shopping.Before work...Good bye. an K"

"event","Wheeeeeeeee.....So personally think that tonight was ALOT fun-er then last night.Seriously. I've come to the realization that dancing is just exhausting. Especially for like 3 hours worth. I've become oldddd. It's sad. Work has made me feel old and tired.All the FRICKIN time. I'm like no longer hyper anymore.So depressing. And so no longer&nbsp;able to be like the energizer bunny like&nbsp;all the young-ish&nbsp;ppl.Yep.Not possible.&nbsp; Andddddd......that personally think that&nbsp;the&nbsp;ONLY time that dancing would be uttery amazing is if i went with my hunny out to dinner and we danced a COUPLE times.Not like 20 times,lol. Other then that....It's just...""hmmm,okay.""&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Okay...So i'm gonna back track like SEVERAL days........do de do doooooo....... 

Sunday. I worked with jolly ppl. And i talked to nick on the phone.That was amazing :) I think something interesting happened sunday. But lately like all the day's that i work..which is basically EVERY day. Since, Kate no longer get's day's off.....apparently. Just seem to like run together into one big......day. Monday. I went and saw ""No reservation"" with William and my sister.That was fun :) Tuesday. I had classes. Nothing amazing happened.... Just ""hmm"". Then i worked that evening. And customer's got REALLY upset at me.And i wanted to stab somethingggggggggggg... Like idk. Customer's make me so mad.Cuz they arent greatful or considerate. Just plain RUDE! I'm like ""wahhhhhh..."" I'm only ONE person. And i'm doing three ppl's job's at ONE time......Taking order's,getting the food for&nbsp;BIG orders,dong fry's for both&nbsp;front and drive.&nbsp;Give me a BREAK! Gosh! 
&nbsp;Wednesday. I overslept.Got ready quickly and rushed to the bus.Thankfully wasnt late nor got hit by a car. lol. Thenn...found out that Ty and Bridgett couldn't come to book club.So me and Allie walked down to dutch bro's got coffee and talked about the book for a little bit.And other stuff. That was jolly :) Then afterwards.....was just plain out right traumazing and did a stupid/smart move.How ever you want to look at it.Then in the afternoon went into first hysteric's and then was super depressed. But went shopping bought clothes, got HARRESSED by the nail ppl. I still think i should press charges against them traumatizing me by talking/touching me. hehe :P&nbsp;Then &nbsp;came home,got pizza, and did hw. The end.&nbsp; 
Thursday. I had classesssss.....At swing i did lead the whole time.Surprisingly enough.Was super fun.Cuz being follower get's REALLY old quickly. I went the thrift store and bought snazzy shoes for the dance. :D Then was 10 minutes late for work. Basically. Was VERY irriated with customer's. Especially boy customer's. I have no patience with them flirting with me.......I just glare. And hope they leave my presence quickly. ;P 
Friday. I worked. Theresa was nice to me.Which made me happy.Since she REALLY scares me...alot. lol. Joseph did his usual thing of teasing me.....buttt..i was like HALF a sleep. He say's that's the best time to tease me.Cuz i'm like sleepy and vulnerable. I was like SADDDD....that's not fair.Cuz i cant come up with a good comeback quickly.He and christian REALLY thought i was on something before i came to work. I was like&nbsp; ""NOOO! Gosh.How can you think that?!? I'm just REALLLYY tired!"" :P 
And then came home and got ready for the dance.The dance was fun.Not a ubberly fun though. Just okay. I dont like to necessarily jump around for several hours...that's like. Silly. I danced 13 slow dances all together with the boys. My feet achedddddd.. I didnt take many pictures though.Which was kinda lame. The thing though with group events like that. I'm okay for awhile....and then start feeling SUPER emo and missing michigan friends.ALOT! Like words can explain how much. *sighs* Seriously.This has been like *my* week of missing friends..... Thursday i felt emo and friday i felt emo.&nbsp;Blehhhhh.. 
Last night. I stayed up and watched show's online till 2 in the morning.Then slept in to 11ish. Was lazy all afternoon.Finally got somewhat ready for the day.When i was getting dressed....I heard little voices in the living room.Hehehe :P I was like ""wheeeeeeeee"" Isaak is here :D He's muah home boi! Okay. So i decided that little caesar's sounded SUPER good...and so i convinced my sister to go half with me.And so i trotted over to little caesar's and got us a pizza.Came home. Isaak was SOO excited about having pizza. The silly thing though.Is that before he HATED pizza.But today he decided he liked it.So we sat down at the table. So Jsyk.My sister and her husband arent christian's at ALL! Basically. But whenever isaak is over for dinner..and we are having a family dinner. Isaak has been taught to&nbsp; hold hands,bow your head,and close your eyes and then my dad would pray. And so today.He made sure everyone was holding hands.And then he bowed his head....and said something.......some baby talk. And then ""AMEN!""...:D It was SOOO cute! Then of course there was him running STARK naked down the hall. And confirming to me.That yes. He was naked and QUITE proud of it.LOL. I'm like ""ahhhh...*cover's eyes*""&nbsp; 

So tonight.....was ALOT of fun! I went to my friend Devin's house for a party. Saw lots of jolly ppl :D I went as a Hawaiin tourist. Lei's around my neck,flip flops,and this cool sash thingy around my waist. But I was a cold tourist....so i had my jacket.&nbsp; We played fun gamesss.....I didnt really get the whole....""trying to figure out what super hero you are"" game. I basically heart mafia.It amuses me.And i've played it like..... 3 times at different parties. lol. I kidnapped katie....muwahahaha. Watched the boy's play Helo 3? I REALLY REALLY wanted to play. Buttttt...didnt want to like thoroughly embarress myself playing. lol.So i didnt.Next time i will :D Christian from work. Texted me.And was like ""what are you up too?"" I'm replied back...""I'm with a bunch of boys...dont ask!"" *chuckles* Overall was a fun night! : D : DAnd then came home and stayed up late talking to William.About ""stuff"". hehe :P It's our new tradition getting on IM at like 11ish and talking late. It's fun :D And nowww..I'm going to bed.&nbsp; 


Good night!"

Okay. So yeah. Monday....I got payed.And spent WAY to much money shopping. It was intense! But i found my dress for the dance next friday. I refused to wear my purple one. Wow. That dress just needs to be retired. Seriously. lol. And bought alot of other things for like 150 dollars. LOL. Yeahhh..i know i have a problem. Tuesday was INTERESTING.Everyone is TRYING to match make for me.I'm like ""AHHHH!!!!"" It's kinda traumatizing...alittle. iI talked to Ashley on the phone that afternoon.That was pretty darn amazing.Things are going really good for her.Which makes me REALLY happy :D :D :D I""ve been pretty worried about her. Wednesday I had my PSAT. I dont think i did very good on it. I'm not sure. I KNOW i didnt do very good on the essay question.That's for sure. Anddd...of course i wont know my score till like January. *sighs* But its starting to get me realizing that i have only two more years left. I need to figure out some things. Or attempt too. Like what college and what major........... But i DO know. I'm going into medical. I've been pretty&nbsp;firm about that. No fickle-ness.&nbsp;I saw the light.And realized going into educational.Wouldn't be a smart move. lol. So yesss......But i REALLY think i want my major to be some sort of therapy like occupational therapy. Yep,Yep :D 

Later...Wednesday.....I took the plunge and dyed my hair. It was stress-ful! VERY! I was like all....""AHHHH...my hair is going to look AWFUL. I know it! AHHH"" lol. But it didnt.And i like it alot :D 

Thursday....I had classes. Swing was...""bring a friend to class"" day. So i brought hannah.That was fun.Shocked a couple more girls...that we are sister's. *rolls eyes* It's starting to get alittle old. I just need a shirt that states it.Seriously. Then i worked till 10:30.Got home. Was asleep by 11:30.And then up at 6:20 for another 8 hour shift.It was long. Very long. Joseph got me laughing hysterically yesterday. He dyed his hair thursday afternoon...and its pretty close to the same shade as mine.And considering our history together aka history aka frienship.Whatever. I was like.....OH.WOW! This is TO funny! LOL. Poor joe he got made fun alot all day long. But i appologized later.And told him that i liked it. :) So it's all good.&nbsp; 

Bible study was good. I really thought i wasnt gonna come. Cuz i was SO exhausted. But i'm glad i did. The beginning of it. I was kinda irked/frustrated. Being tired probably didnt help those feelings on top of it. It's just soooo..annoying ""trying"" to fit in. Like i know. You dont have to..blah,blah. But for me. I do. And it's just annoying when i feel likeee.....""ppl"" just dont get me or like me or whatever. I got SO use to knowing where *my* place was in the rev group and church groupie. And feeling&nbsp;SO &nbsp;accepted to be me. It's just&nbsp;really annoying.&nbsp;*sighs* &nbsp;But before it started. I finally was like. Okay. Whatever. Just cuz ppl are going to be silly.Does not mean i cant have a good night here. So there! And after i decided that....i REALLY did!&nbsp;&nbsp;:D And it was amusing.....to say the least.hehehe :P&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Today...We visited a church.It was interesting. :) OH!!!! And ander called me! WOW! That seriously made my day :D That he thought about me.And was like ""hmmm....I'm gonna call KATE!"" :D So we had a good conversation. It made me happy :D&nbsp;*pats ander* Thenn...Tonight i WAS gonna go to the movie night thingy. But it got cancelled at like the last moment.Made me sad : ( Cuz i was pretty excited about going. *sighs* Oh well. The babies came over tonight. isaak cracks me up.LOL. I am a bad influence on him. AHAHA :P *shy* Anddddd....Now i'm going to bed. 

OH! I forgot to say. That i know how to do MAKE food at work....My favorite to do is mcchicken's. :D"

"event","&nbsp;Hmmmm...... I'm in like a REALLY good mood right now. Its kinda...strange. I think its cuz i got enough sleep last night and friday night too. Like 11ish hours both nights. :D That put's kate in a good mood. Anywho! 

Thursday i had classes. (This is for katie) Classes are going gooooood.&nbsp; 
Spanish is okay. I think i'm understanding it. For the most part. And it's actually&nbsp;STICKING in my brain. Not going out one ear and out the other which is good. lol. Like i randomly have spanish words pop into my head. It's kinda strange,actually. hehe :P Next monday.I have another spanish test. I'm suppose to take tests on friday. But yeah. I work EVERY friday.So instead. I just have to come monday and get the test from the office. Then take it there in like the whisper study.&nbsp; 
Media and Culture is just okay. We havent done anything TO exciting. It's just. ""hmmm...okayyyyyy"".&nbsp; 
Math is just AMUSING! lol. Basically!! &nbsp;I have officially found my spot in that class. Isnt it funny though? That like every class you soon find YOUR spot that you sit like EVERY week. So mine in algebra is between Devin and Soren and then James is in front of me. Its amusing. Makes me laugh.&nbsp; 
Swing is amazing!!! But last week. I kinda got tired from doing the same thing over and over again. I hope it's just a fluke. And the week before that. I was like running a fever from my cold. That was just INTERESTING! Cuz i was just checked out. Basicallyyyy..in kate world. It wasnt good. I feel bad for my partner's. Having to deal with me.I commented to Nathaniel that i was doing better then last week. Not running a fever and not completely checked out. He was like ""good!"" hehe. :P&nbsp; 

Then this past thursday night. Me and my mommie went to the mall. I'm looking for a new dress for the dance. Cuz i have put my foot down i will NOT wear that same dress that i wore to the past two formals that i went too. That dress needs to be officially retired. Seriously. I SO wish lauren,though. That you lived closer. Cuz i REALLY want to borrow one of your amazing dresses :D *sighs* Oh well. :P But yes. I tried on lots of dresses. And lots of them were quite scandalous. Yeahhhh... dont believe in wearing low cut dresses. That is just AWKWARD! Or ones that look&nbsp;like they are lingerie.&nbsp;Basically. &nbsp;So... i'm still looking. I'm hoping to find something at Deb's.Cuz they have jolly dresses.&nbsp; 

So i first ran into my aunt who was with Hannah.That was kinda awkward. Don't ask. And so they invited me to go see a movie with them.So i did. Thennn... i ran into Soren alittle later that night. That was jolly. He was looking for Christian and&nbsp; later he told me.That he just left Christian at the mall. I was like ""sadddd"". lol. And i exited-ly told him that i was gonna go see a movie. My FIRST &nbsp;R rated movie in the theater. Ahahaha... I'm&nbsp;a dork.&nbsp;But yeah. I went and saw ""3:10 to Yuma"". I'm not sure why it was rated R cuz in my oppinion it could have been PG-13. All they showed was alot of blood and swore. The end. But it was GOOD! I liked it. It was kinda epic trying to get my ticket. Cuz i can LEGALLY see R rated movie's cuz i'm now 17. BUT! I didnt have my Id with me. And so i was like wahhhh...please let me in! So she asked me what my birthdate was.And i told her.And it took her FOREVER to mentally calculate that i was 17. So finally was like. Yeah..i'm 17!!! Finally. I was like. DUH! Here's my mother. (Who was still with me when i bought my ticket). I was like.....yeah.She can verify it that i'm 17! Seriously! lol.&nbsp;So the girl was nice. And she gave me my ticket. Yay. :D&nbsp; 

Friday. I worked and it was EPIC! Wow. I truly dislike my job...ALOT! So for like&nbsp;an hour or two,&nbsp;i was like doing 4 ppl's jobs at ONE time.&nbsp;And i'm only one person.&nbsp;Last time i checked.heheh :P &nbsp;Nothing was stocked! We got SLAMMED. Meaning. I had a FULL lobby of ppl and a line in drive thru. So it was STRESS-ful! Thennnn......... It was time for me to leave. But i stayed later to stock for them. Cuz i knew they were gonna be stuck later on if i didnt. Then one of my manager's was having issues.Cuz i wanted to leave since it was WAY&nbsp; past the time i was suppose to clock off. She was like ""kate..can't you just wait a few seconds.gosh"" I was like ""grrrr"". Trying to be patiennnnnnnttttt... But yes. FINALLY.They let me leave. Sometimes i wish i wasnt so nice and like good.Seriously. I REALLY just wanted to leave at 4. And wanted to care less if they werent stocked or whatever for dinner. Especially.Since they over-worked me. But i couldn't. So i did it.&nbsp; 

Work sucks. The end. 

Bible study was AMAZING! I hadnt laughed THAT hard in like a LONG time! Except this past tuesday listening to Nick's voice message. Wow. Now that was HILLARIOUS! But yes. Bible study was jolly. And yet&nbsp;another person is added to the growing list of ppl.Who are shocked that hannah and i are related.And ESPEICALLY at the thought that i'm older then her by like 2 1/2 years.LOL. It use to bother me alot about ppl thinking she is older then me. But idc anymore. I'm like whateverrrr...looking young-ish is gonna come in REALLY handy when i'm 30.And look like 25. LOL.&nbsp; 
And i've decided i'm NEVER invited another guy type friend to bible study again....seriously. It's like digging yourself a hole or grave.&nbsp;How ever you want to look at it. hehe. :P &nbsp;Cuz your pure intentions soon become very awkward. Cuzzz..yeahhhh..basically. I'm hoping that i can dig myself out of my hole at school tuesday. If not. Idk. But devin is jolly. For helping me out of an awkward situation.&nbsp; 

Saturday. I went to the coast with my family. That was shocking-ly enough ALOT of fun!!! My family is insane. AHAHA.&nbsp; ; P *whew* So we were gone from 11 to like 6. And then we had appetizer's at home. And watched one of the world's LAME-est movies. Then i stayed up late.Being silly online. But my 'space profile is all re-vamped.And i'm SUPER happy how it looks. Let me tell you...it has taken me DAYS to finally be happy with how it looks. So go check it out :D 

So tonight i work til 5-9. Please pray for my soul!"

"event","&nbsp;Wow! I am <strong>so </strong>mad at myself right now. I hate guys.And actually more like. I hate my love life.Seriously.Becoming a nun is sounding <strong>SO</strong> much better every day. It's like the guys i like are <strong>SO</strong> un-attainable. It's so frustrating. I tell myself that oh. I dont need a guy. And i really dont. It's just frusrating liking someone. And feeling like they are just playing mind games with you. Life would be so un-complicated without those two. Seriously. Grrrrr.........<br /><br />Okay. I'm done venting. :) So i'm procrastinating about doing any hw. I REALLY dont want to go to work tonight. I work from 3-10 tonight. Bleh. But the only good thing is that i get to work with Joseph :) He says i talk to much. Butttttt..........i refuse to believe that. gosh. lol.<br /><br />So. I actually did go see Transfomer's last thursday night. It was fun. But i must admit there were a few moments in the movie.That i just could NOT restrain myself to mock. lol. It was like wow. That's silly. Then friday i worked in the morning. It was lame. Cuz shane was working that day. *sadness* Then i went to bible study. The message was FANTASTICAL! :D But yeah. We already established that :P But i didnt really care for the group that i was in after pizza. It was just..idk. Fascinating. And i dont believe in micah stealing my phone and ""texting"" with a girl that i work with.Seriously.Yeah. Never having that happen again. But i got to tease tyshea about it merciles-ly later&nbsp;:P ahaha. Wow. Anywho.&nbsp;<br /><br />Saturday morning i went with my family downtown to the farmer's market and got to hear the Homesource Jazz band play. Wow. They are like amazing! True story! Then later that evening me and my papa built my BEAUTIFUL black shelf.It was kinda epic. But i am in love with that shelf. hehehe :P Then that night i went over to laura's for laura's exchange student Jin Woo's birthday party. And met ALOT of fascinating/cool ppl from like Russia,Italy,and&nbsp; Germany. It was cool. But at times it was kinda awkward.Since i didnt really know them.....at all. Hmm...so yeah.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then Sunday i worked. That was pretty epic. Me and joseph got into a fight.And he threw ice at me. :( ahaha :P Then he got a wave of sickness and so he rushed off to the male's bathroom to throw up.It was sadly amusing. I felt bad about laughing....but he did it to himself.So yeah. It's own darn fault for&nbsp;eating WAY to much food and especially &nbsp;sugary foods cuz he's a diabetic! SO not smart! Wow. ahaha. *shakes head*&nbsp;<br /><br />Weeeelllllllll.....I am gonna go work on hw. Stuff. So yeahhhhh...<br /><br /><br /><br />The end.<br /><br />P.S. Nick made me upset yesterday and i'm still kinda irked at him........*sighs*"

I still have my cold. I dont think its gonna leave me anytime soon. Which is kinda gay.&nbsp;<br />I had somewhat plans<br />to go see Transfomer's tonight. But cuz of multiple reasons the main one.People being<br />People and just kinda un-dependable. I'm calling it off. So yeah.<br />&nbsp;I got invited by Emily Hill to&nbsp;<br />go to Matt Corey's suprise birthday party today. I was like ohhhh..kayyy. Cuz i dont think&nbsp;<br />Emily really knew me.

"event","<p>Wow.So i wrote this REALLY long epic-ful&nbsp; post last night.And then i accidentally clicked on my gmail on my toolbar. Cuz it said i had new mail? Which i didnt. It liessss... And so i lost the WHOLE post. It was depressing.So yeah. You guys dont get it. Cuz i have ZERO motivation to re-write it again.Sorry. I might write clips of what i did said.Like later.&nbsp;But instead you guys to get to hear about my wonderful dream!&nbsp;Wheeeeeeeee........<br /><br />So last night.Wow. I truly loved that dream. It was pretty amazing.So i was married like RIGHT now. Cuz i remembering saying to my ""husband"" that i wasnt yet 18. And my husband was like 20ish and super mature and smart-ish. Ahahah..i have no clue what he saw in me??!!? :P And we had two kids and i was pregnant with my third.And i was kinda depressed about it. But was like whatever. I can be okay with this. And i was SOOO content and SOO happy. It.was.amazing!&nbsp;True story!<br /><br />But have no fears kate's not gonna run off and find some guy to get married right now.LOL. &nbsp;I'm TO smart for that. But i kinda feel that in a strange way it was God's way of telling me that I dont need to worry or over-think&nbsp;about my soul mate. I've been thinking alot about the whole marriage thing and making a wise decision about my soul mate. To a point of being a TAD paranoid. Just a tad.lol. So yeah. The end. :D<br /><br />So I'm still sick. My sore throat has now increased to including a runny nose and a cough.Blehhhh..And i'm suppose to work tonight. That is going to be INTERESTING!&nbsp;<br /><br />So this wednesday.Will and i are getting a group to go see transformerse.So that's gonna be fun.And i think we are having a book club meeting.Idk.We didnt have one last week.Cuz 1. We didnt have the book. 2. I overslept. Oops.*halo*&nbsp; And we still dont have the book. I need to talk to allie and see if she got it. hehe.Since we tried last week to get our library cards.But to get one you have to have like an electric bill or phone bill. But my dad is gone and ALL the bills are in his name.So yeah. It's silly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then thursday i have classes. Wheee....Swing dancing :D The poor boys who had to dance with me last week. Thursday was a BAD day for me. Basically i was in kate world ALL FRICKIN DAY LONG! It was not good. Lol. Most likely i'll get called into to go to work. I seriously dont seem to have many day's off. Cuz on my day's off they still call me into work. *Sighs* Then friday i work from like 7 in the morning to 2 in the afternoon.Which is kinda gay. But oh well. Then i have bible study. Then saturday is the movie night. I've got to find out from zach where its gonna be at. Cuz last saturday. I couldnt go. Because my mom was in the middle of making dinner and i couldnt figure out a ride ALL the way over to springfield.So i was mildly depressed about going. But i lived :P OH!!!!! So sometime this week like thursday or friday-ish. I am gonna go into the DMV and get my permit!!!!!!!!!!! Yayyyy!!!!! :D :D :D&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","&nbsp;So i feel this strangest urge to blog.Sooooooo...I am :) 

I realized i havent updated since like BEFORE i left to go to seattle.&nbsp;I'm not sure when or where to stop or end. lol. 

&nbsp;So seattle was jolly. Me and my mom had one of our usual heart to heart talks about life.lol. aka boys and love life type things. I saw my brother which was warm fuzzies. :) Anddddd.... My three cousins who two of them i havent seen in like 3 years?!?! Kinda intense! So the weekend was the usual VERY dramatic and EVERYTHING was like a production. It got old quickly. Making sandwhiches took 40 minutes to make?!?!? Ohhhh..yeah! We stayed&nbsp; in a very fancy hotel in seattle along with one set of my aunts' and uncles' and their two kids. So me,timmy,and hannah went into the sauna. Had a very epic conversation with a stranger man. Yeah. Seriously. I have become WAY to talkative and friendy lately&nbsp;for my own good. It's gonna be the death of me! Stupid Mcdonalds corrupting me!!! lol. And then we left sunday afternoon. I was ALMOST in tears when i said goodbye to my grandpa.Wow. Honestly. He acted like i was never gonna see him again...he's getting old and not doing so well. I'm PRAYING that i dont have to go to second funeral this year. I dont think i could handle it. Seriously. *sighs* 

This past saturday night i went out to dinner with Will Cook and some of his buddies. That was ALOT of fun!!!! I really want to do that again....going out to dinner to sherries.We talked about alot of random things. Will teased me about my ice tea habbits, text messages,and then Nick?!?! LOL. He KNOWS that me and nick are just best friends. But he still likes to tease me about it.hehe :P Whateverrrrrr...... 

Classes are going good. I'm not feeling very stressed about&nbsp; hw and such. Which is good. I'm meeting new ppl and becoming better friends with some. Which is awesome.&nbsp;Swing is amazing. Wow. Seriously has become my new passion in life. Dancing! :D Poor zach had to witness me being VERY hyper off of ice tea.LOL.&nbsp; 

Work has its usual....drama-ness. But i love my work ppl's :D I'm SLOWLY getting better at doing back booth. Yesterday. Was traumatic at work. I dont think i have been that intense and little stressed in quite some time. Nights lately haven't been that bad.And so i've gotten alittle lazy. Plus i havent ""runned"" aka bagged food in like a LONG time. They have been making me take orders for 5 hours at a time. I've decided i dislike being nice and friendly. lol. But autumn knows i cant be other then that.Soooo...I'm still stuck on ""window"" aka taking orders. 

I saw Tyler yesterday for like 2 minutes.We havent worked together in quite some time.Which i'm glad. Poor guy was playing with his tie cuz he was so nervous talking to me :(&nbsp; Me and Joseph have gotten better and better at being cynical with each other. I'm working on my QUICK quirps/re-buttles back to him. ahaha :P He THINKS he wins our arguments. But&nbsp;that's&nbsp;ALL &nbsp;in his head! LOL.&nbsp; 

Yesterday. I went to the mailing store and mailed off this ""happy meal toy"" for nick. Yeah. That boy has me whipped or else i'm like a REALLY good friend.Take your pick. I told him about these happy meal toys that are from one of his favorite kid shows. He wanted me to get one of them for him.And since...i was nice. I got it and then mailed it off. I felt SOOO ridiculse paying for shipping that cost MORE then the toy itselt! So VERY wrong!&nbsp; But...now i've decided that i'm nick's NEW and BEST-est friend....ever! The end.lol ;) 

Tonight,Tyanna,Aaron, Kevin and I went and saw Bourne Ultimatium. Wow. That movie was like INTENSE! But very hardcore!!! I liked it immensly. Aaron TRIED getting me to jump/shriek by poking at me which a scary/intense moment was happening. But...it didnt work.ahaha :P&nbsp; 

So i was able to shift my work schedule around so now i'm able to go to bible studies on friday nights. And then every wednesday about late morning....Ty,Allie, and i have formed a book club. Basically our&nbsp; protest to the silly World Lit class that me and ty dropped out of. And so we formed a book club&nbsp;and &nbsp;we are meeting every week. And then every saturday night is movie night at different ppl's house. Which will be fun!!! So with hanging with friends,then the every week events,classes,hw,and work. I'm gonna be busy. But happily busy :)"

"event","&nbsp;So yeah. I REALLY should be in bed right now. But feeling kinda insane at the moment. Basically. lol.Today has been SUPER long. But i'm trying to get back into the habit of blogging cuz i've been out of it for a few months now. So yeah. This is my new goal in life along with the million other's i have at the moment.&nbsp;

So my classes are okay. I'm kinda feeling un-satisfactory about them. Idk. Probably.Cuz i didnt get all that i wanted. So spanish is FUN! I'm excited about taking that. Algebra 2 is cool. I'm like SO amused cuz they are a few guys in that class that i remember taking 1/2 algebra with them like FOREVER ago.So amusing! Oh. And devin is in that class too.That is awesome. I was like ""wheeee"" a familiar face :) And he is in my media and culture class.Oh.wow. I had media and culture today.And basically it is AMAZING. That is like the ONLY class i'm excited about taking :D :D And i had swing today! WHEEEE!!!! *happiness* Idk. Its just not the same dancing without matt or daniel. *sighs* This week has been pretty intense! But not really. Its strange i've actually starting to miss not being stressed or not being a workaholic. Its a foreign feeling not being either of those two. Yes. I know i'm insane :)&nbsp;Anddd....I'm gonna drop World Lit. So basically i only have three classes?!?!?! This is not good. Bleh. 

So Yesterday was EPIC! Yep. First i missed the bus to go to homesource cuz i was kidnapping laura to come back home with me. Thenn...we had a VERY epic walk home. We got kinda sidetracked and went by work and got lunch. That was fun.And i kinda saw Tyler. But i didnt have to talk to him. Which was good. Yeahhh...I'm not sure what to think about THAT whole situation. lol. Thenn...we made our way to my house.And today we were suppose to get a package with all the dsl junk to hook up the cp. But we missed it. And i noticed that the UPS guy JUST left.And so yeah. I........chased him down. Till i got my package :) Thennn...i missed the bus to go to work. I was like wow. This si not good. But my mom just got home and so she took me.Which was good. Thenn....i had GREAT epic-ness trying to figure out why my dsl didnt want to work. *whew* Just ask Will. I was having ISSUES! lol. But figured it out. yay! So overal it was just an epic day! The end.&nbsp;

Oh.And on top of it...I am gonna become a nun.&nbsp;YEP! &nbsp;That was one of my other new life goals. Me= Sister Mary Katherine....err....something like that.hehe :P Yeahh. Dont ask. lol.&nbsp;

So 2morow......I'm leaving for seattle in the morning. My parents planned this family re-union.And so we are going to be gone all weekend. I am SUPER excited.Cuz i havent seen two set's of my relatives AND my own brother in like more then ONE year! It's crazy!&nbsp;

Random thought. I now know how to do back booth.....yeppp.... My life is now officially completed in all things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The end."

"event","<p>&nbsp;Okay.So i'm doing a more thorough(sp?)&nbsp; updating-ness! :D</p><br /><p>School starts officially for me 2morow! Oh-em-gee! I am quite apprehensive about the whole thing.A great part of me wish i was starting a new year at REV. But yeah. Thats not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible. Lame-ness! So far. I only have classes tuesday and thursday. Tuesday, i have&nbsp; Spanish and Algebra 2.Then thursday, I have Spanish,Media and Culture, Algebra 2, and then Swing!&nbsp; Wheee!! :D I'm REALLY hoping to get into&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemistry and Psychology.But we'll see :)&nbsp;<br /><br />And then on top of it. I am working....But! I am NOT going to be a work-aholic like i was last semester. Ony 20 hours instead of the usual&nbsp; 30ish a week. This next thursday is going to be intense. Basically gonna be gone from 8 in the morning to about 10:30 at night. Bleh!&nbsp;SO not looking forward to that.<br /><br />So work is JOLLY!&nbsp; True story! My all time favorite swing manager is Shane! Yess...He is 27 and basically married but not.lol. And he has a dry sense of humor and a tad cynical sometimes. Part of the time if you dont know him very well. You'd think he was always mad at you! Which is amusing. Cuz he's not. But we get along great! Then I work majority of the time with Christian,Emily, Tyler, Ty, Joseph, Angel, and Marjorie. OH.And Jeremy. But i dont like Jeremy he is WAY to cocky! And very annoying! And thinks *i* should steal food for him!?!?!? Yeahhhh...no! Christian last week nicknamed me.....Kate-y G. For those who dont know like me. What the heck ""g."" means. It means gangsta. lol. So its ""What up kate-y gee?!?""&nbsp; So i have my own&nbsp;&nbsp;matchmaking group thingy. Which consists of shane,em, and christian.Shane decided one day that since i was single. *I* needed a bf. I have no choice in the matter. Basically told me this in like 5 seconds. I was like....uhhhhhhhh...whatt??!?!? huh?!?!? SHANE! NO! So its amusing them trying to set me up with any single guy at work. And QUITE awkward too! I've actually come to the conclusion that I'm gonna remain single till i'm like 18 or 19. Dating is just SILLY!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence. My new decision for life is to become a nun.&nbsp;&nbsp;hehehe. Me and lauren are going to be naughty nuns together.ahaha ;)&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Oh.So yes. I now have more minutes on my phone. No longer having such a lame-o&nbsp;phone plan.Which is very exciting! More time to talk to ppl. I am officially settled into my new house :D&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;bought this really snazzy desk which im in love with. And i now have black comforter and black curtains. My mom actually is starting to get freaked again that i'm turning back into a emo-ish type of person.lol.Which is very funny! Makes me chuckle! Our internet is getting hooked up this wednesday!!! Yay!!! But i've actually am no longer addicted to the internet anymore. So i dont really think i'm gonna be online as much as i insanely use to be. Instead my new addiction is the phone.lol. Oh dear :P I think thats all i have to say for now........<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The end. <br /><br /></p>"

"event","my birthday = interestin event...
first, i went with dawn to do laundry at her parent's house. 
then Renee gets kicked out of her house, so she moves in. we are no longer dating because don't want problems with living conditions.
rob tom and dallas come over... rob bearing gift. 

all this built up to me being damn drunk, Bryan brought over kait which made me feel slightly awkward, but i ended up walking her home, damn that was a long walk. well, from there Bryan picked me up, by the time i returned tom and dallas were gone... Dallas ended up losing his wallet and tom his rancid shirt. but, wow. alcohol is fun. this weekend, rob and i are probably going to get some peppermint schnops and vodka (or cheap beer) then get really really wasted. november fourth rob is off probation and on the six rob is hold his first ""Get Fucked Up"" party. should be interesting. well actually he's had a few but this one is actually titled."

"event","it's my birthday... neener neener neener...

anyways, i'm with dawn, we're doing laundry. Renee just called her crying, i hope everything's ok, dawn just went to get her. so i'm at her house, because Renee can't have boys over, so... yeah, damn. i hope she's ok. i like her a lot, and well i'm really nervous around her, i've wanted to kiss her for a while now, but everytime i get there i get all shy and close up... she slept on the couch last night and by the time i went to bed she was asleep so  being nice and not wanting to disturb her while she looked adorably on the couch i just fell asleep on the floor next to her. so far, my birthday is ok, on the phone Renee said she needed some place to go so if she end's up staying with us that would be cool... i just hope everything is ok. i like her A LOT. she's a really sincere and nice person. and cute!!! hee hee.

i gotta call rob later, he's probably coming over bearing a gift of hot damn."

"event","i watch the world around me fall to pieces, staring into a flourescent sea. neon lights and street signs. innocence ripped from childrens' hands as they leave the womb. we are all born into our hometown. from there we become our surroundings. rather than evolve and stray from the litter we dwell in our own humanless struggle. we tunr into machines. we become statistic within the borders on a map, or the flag which becomes our self serving diety. i sometimes like to look into the mirror to see what i have become. here i am, two decades from birth and still only 13 city blocks from where i grew up. nothing has really changed, i have aged, i haved learned things, but i for some reason feel the desire to stray from this monotony of this psychogeographical landscape, i feel the desire to break from what i was raised to know, sure i some but one can never know it all. this i guess is more of a rant than anything, just me going on a tangent. i feel like i'm dependent, but then aren't we all. for four months of my life i wasn't. those four months were me without a place to live, so therefore going from place to place. it was cold, i didn't sleep much, nor did i eat much, but it opened my eyes to things i would have never known. and for that i am thankfull, for it has made me a more wise person than i used to be. but i still feel dependent. be it a job. be it someone helping you make your way. you are dependent. the only way to not be so is to cut all your chains. to not let anything hold you. vagrancy."

2. falling on the ground while we were palying and rolling around spazzing out for the hell of it.
3. spitting blood on some random person in the crowd.
4. bare knuckle boxing with tom, though he punched me in the back of the head pretty hard.
5. the burrito place we went to.
6. getting 8 packs of smokes for under $10.
7. playing pool and wooping Dallas' ass.
8. spitting on myself onstage.

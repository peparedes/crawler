yeah i made it so long ago. but its good for me. im so sick of not having anyone to talk to. i talk to craig about some things but i hate not having that one wicked awesome friend that i know i can talk to. yeah jess i can talk to but now that she doesnt have a bf she gets mad/ jealous [ she told me] that i talk about things with craig, she gets upset cuz it doesnt makeit any easier on her cuz she misses havingabf. that whole deal. 

i miss just everything. i fuck up everything. i miss people i used to be around all the time. its just sad in general. i just hatelife and im sorry that this is fucking depressing but thats how ive been, nothings the same. the only time im happy is when im around craig because im so happy i have him, and jess because she makes me laugh but theresjust those certain things that alwayssss kill you inside no matter what you do, i miss you."

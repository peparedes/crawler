"event","so i'm either going to mount holyoke or simmons next semester. mount holyoke is probably going to win.


in 13 days i never have to work at burton's grill in north andover ever again.


there are only 3 weeks of school left. which means that there are only 3 weeks until the cape. and only 3 weeks left at merrimack. and only 3 weeks until my sanity returns.


there may very well be a joining of several friends in our second floor apartment this summer.


i just painted the fridge blue. 


i don't write in this thing anymore because it serves no purpose whatsoever. 

the end."

"event","Here is your personal palm reading!  This will be a general reading of your palm, and what it says about you and your personality.  Enjoy.

First let's take a look at your Life Line.  You have the best kind of Life Line, long and clearly marked.  This shows that you will possess good health, vitality and a very nice life expectancy.  The wide swooping motion of your Life Line indicates strength, enthusiasm and an improved love life.  A chained Life Line indicates various health problems, both physical and emotional. Many people with allergies have such a line as well.

Now let's see what your Head Line had to say.  Your Head Line is deep, long  and straight, stretching across the palm.  This indicates a logical and direct way of thinking. The straighter the line, the more realistic the thinking, and the deeper the line, the better the memory.  A chained Head Line shows agitation and tension at different points in your life.  The joining of your Head Line and Life Line at the beginning indicates that your strong sense of mind generally rules over your body. You also look at childhood with a cautious and fearful outlook.

The last line we'll look at is your Heart Line.  A slight disregard to the true meaning of love and its responsibilities are indicated by a Heart Line like yours that starts between the middle and index finger.  You tend to easily give your heart away.  The small lines you may see extending upward from your Heart Line are a good sign, as they illustrate happiness in love. Your chained Heart Line is an indication that your life is sometimes bothered by emotional tensions.

  You have a conical hand.  This is often the type of hand shared by people who are more interested in theory than practice.  This is the hand of the imaginative and creative spirit.  Professions of people who share this type of hand usually include teacher, lawyer or artist."

we could die tomorrow. just saying.

maybe it's not that i'm crazy. maybe it's just that i'm bored with the monotony that i'm faced with already at home. with the life that i leave behind by the living the current. with the lack of bounce in my curls.

i just feel like i'm fading away too fast. i can't think up ways to entertain myself other than the ways that our whole generation is using. and it's sad. cause i'm not entertained any longer. i feel like a 60 year old trapped in an 18 year old body who has no ability to recollect what it is to play and be adventurous and make something of myself. 

so maybe i should do something to change that. there's a lot of potential energy loaded into these young bodies of ours. we just need to jump that barrier of activation and make it fucking kinetic. otherwise, it's going to be a very long month. otherwise, i might burst."

You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

"event","so i've officially been here for 1 week. hot pots are officially pivitol to my existance, but the taste of thai noodles in my green tea is not. therefore, do not make thai noodles in your hot pot. . .no matter how many times you clean it, the taste will not leave.

but yeah. college kind of kicks a lot of ass. i guess that's partly due to the fact that i found fucking awesome people in the first few days. . and already had my soulmate picked out when i got here. 

i'm doing work study at the theatre. that excites me. i don't think that i'm going to get a part in the play cause there are only like 6 parts (the importance of being earnest) but i working in set with cool new people excites me.

while here i have learned many things (non-academic). a few of which are:

*kill bill is too violent for my tastes
*pink inflatable chairs do not slide on carpet, even when you cover them in seran wrap.
*lambroasting does not involve lamb. it does involve 2 men, a mouth and a vagina.
*""don't even bother knocking"" does not mean ""come on in"". it means people are doing the hanky panky.
*blonde bubbly chicks can actually be really cool people.
*random men may be in your bathroom at 1 in the morning. no worries.
*boondock saints is a pretty kick ass flick.
*human bowling. . . nuf said.
*when i consume alcohol, i will be playing kings.
*just because you're payed to do cariactures doesn't mean you can do cariactures.
*when you call high school friends and they're in unpleasant moods, it makes you want to see them less. but only a little bit.
*everyone at merrimack college chases booze with gatorade.
*amy is really funny when she's ""out of it""
*college is 1 million gazillion times better than college.
*change that to college is better to high school. cause it is
*do not allow tiny little men to enter your room without asking. . . they'll creep you out a lot with their talk.
*college food can be extremely extremely good.


ok. there are more but i have to read the rest of a play.

for my super tight funkadelic friends from western massachusetss. . . i miss you like whoa. and i'll see you soooooon :o)

and i suppose that's all for now.

the days go by really fast here.

but i don't know how i went so long without them.


cheers.

sara anne.

"event","so updating this here majiggy has become more of a chore than enjoyable. (hence the not updating)

so the summer is almost over. unlike updating my journal, this summer has been incredible. i love my friends. i love cool summer nights and laying under blankets to look at the stars. i love painting and watching as my apartment becomes more and more appealing. i love belly dancing and people watching at gothic night clubs. i love falling asleep on the beach, boogie boarding, being buried in the sand, and going for long walks with your best friend. i love rocking out in the car with the windows down and driving back and forth between 5 seperate people's houses. i love having no drama. i love seeing old faces and getting huge hugs.

i love the anticipation of a new beginning. and i love the fact that i'm going to be bawling my eyes out when the day to leave finally comes, because that means that i really have something here. i've got everything here.

i love when things just feel so right."

"event","Post five things you enjoy, even when no one around you wants to go out and play.
What lowers your stress/blood pressure/anxiety level?
Post it to your journal, and then tag 5 friends and ask them to post it to theirs.

1.) Reading while drinking ice coffee/green tea. 

2.) drawing/arts and crafts

3.) Listening to abnormal amounts of music .. . and singing along

4.) Cleaning, suprisingly. I hate the thought of it because nothing ever stays clean, but i actually really like doing it.

5.) star gazing


i tag no one, because someone will do it anyway"

Caught on a bridge (the bridge is on fire)
And the stakes are at hand (they're ravenous)
with Your -friends- on the side holding torches.
with Your -angel- on the side holding water.
Who do You run to? 
To whom do You turn?
The water below as black as night.

No one is speaking. 
Yet You can hear your own whispers. (resounding) 
No one is speaking.
But they all know what You've (hidden.)
(It was said with knives and voices)

Grasp for Your weapon. Hold on to the Night.
In the end, nothing is hidden.
And Your bridges are burning
Deception exposure.
The water below as black. . . 


Truth.
The times (like a pinprick) they heard death -alive?- in the dark


-it was You-"

"event","rite, i have a problem, i mean there is a problem with me .... lately, i ve been acting really wierd, its just that i feel like when i am not at a certain place, the people dont miss me, like i mean, it doesnt matter if i am there or not and for the past few days i ve been doing strange things to get attention of people, like i just pick up an argument with someone for no apparent reason or like i ll purposely take somebodys stuff and not give it back, so that THEY come to ME and ask for it and maybe we can start a conversation, i mean i just think people are bored of me and like i should do something to undo that.

Its like i ve lost all my pride u know, it just seems that i am trying too hard to make everyone happy and i am TRYING to make them like me, which i shouldnt, cuz if they dont like me for who i am , they can go fuck themselves and i shudnt be the one running behind them...

ahhh i dunt know, i am just so stressed out right now, i feel like taking a remote control and putting my life to a pause or something, yea ..that was well lame

i even pulled a hamstring while working out last evening, and thats not helping anything either.

fuck this shit, i need a hug now but then again, who will give me one??

"event","Here are a few reasons 
why guys like girls: 

1. 
They will always smell good 
even if its just shampoo 

2. 
The way their heads always 
find the right spot on our shoulder 

3. 
How cute they look when they sleep 

4. 
The ease in which they fit into our arms 

5. 
The way they kiss you and 
all of a sudden everything 
is right in the world 

6. 
How cute they are when they eat 

7. 
The way they take hours 
to get dressed 
but in the end 
it makes it all worth while 

8. 
Because they are always 
warm even when its minus 30 outside 

9. 
The way they look good 
no matter what they wear 

10. 
The way they fish for compliments 
even though you both know that you 
think she's the most 
beautiful thing on this earth 

11. 
How cute they are when they argue 

12. 
The way her hand always finds yours 

13. 
The way they smile 

14. 
The way you feel 
when you see their name 
on the call ID 
after you just had a big fight 

15. 
The way she says 
""lets not fight anymore"" 
even though you know that 
an hour later.... 

16. 
The way they kiss when 
you do something nice for them 

17. 
The way they kiss you 
when you say 
""I love you"" 

18. 
Actually ...... 
just the way they kiss you... 

19. 
The way they fall into your arms 
when they cry 

20. 
Then the way they apologize 
for crying over something that silly 

21. 
The way they hit you 
and expect it to hurt 

22. 
Then the way they apologize 
when it does hurt. 
(even though we don't admit it)! 

23. 
The way they say 
""I miss you"" 

24. 
The way you miss them 

25. 
The way their tears 
make you want to 
change the world 
so that it 
doesn't hurt her anymore..... 
Yet regardless 
if you love them, 
hate them, 
wish they would die 
or 
know that you would die 
without them ... 
it matters not. 
Because once in your life, 
whatever they were to the world 
they become everything to you. 
When you look them in the eyes, 
traveling to 
the depths of their souls 
and 
you say a million things 
without trace of a sound, 
you know that your own life 
is inevitable consumed 
within the rhythmic beatings 
of her very heart. 
We love them for a million reasons, 
No paper would do it justice. 
It is a thing not of the mind 
but of the heart. 
A feeling. 
Only felt. 


Being in love is the greatest feeling in the world even thought it always ends up in a world of pain hurt....

i dont like this mechanical life, i really dont, get up at 7 , get ready and leave for work, come back home at 7 , eat the same subway shit E V E R Y  single fucking day cuz there is no other fuckin good place to eat here , well theres A & W but i dont eat that shit, so yeah fuck u 

Lately i ve been feeling like i am searching for something, everyone i talk to , its like i am trying to get something out of them, i just dont know wut the fuck it is and its annoying me, i am looking for some answers but i dont know wut my questions are. I just wish everything would just stop for a while u know, its going too fast, i cant cope up with it and its fuckin me up, i need a break from anything and everything, i wish i cud just get out of this system of living a life for a bit u know and just look over it and see wut i ve done till now and wut i wanna do next and wut in the fucks sake i am heading for.

I ve a date this saturday, shes 5 yrs elder to me, its the first time i am going out with an older woman, cuz i am sick of them groupie chicks, all they want is ur money and no fuckin thing else, i need someone who is fun, u know, who i can talk to without looking at my watch, i need a good conversation, i really do, i just cant be with someone who i am not comfortable talking to , well i want sex too , hey! i am a guy, so dont blame me , like ross once said in a friends episode, this date has to go well, i havent had sex in 6 months, i am worried about my health u know lol ahh well... its all just so fucked up

<marquee> It's not in my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe,
But she doesn't understand catch attitudes when I leave her (leave her) 
Like being on probation makin' it harder for me to except her 
as my own she tries to tie up my phone and (phone and)
I'm not at home she's thinkin' that I'm not alone probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin to tie her up but see
it's hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me mami 
I'm not your regular nigga I know the game (I know the game) 
But I don't play by the rules I'm focusin' on my moves that way I'll never lose 
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Benz's with 22's 
Say I confuse you play little tricks with your head 
Catchin' feelin's ever since the first time I slept in your bed
I'm not here to tease you mislead you or mess up your dreams (nah)
I can't say I love you I dont know what that means 
I'ma pimp.

"event","<b><i>Ashish Jain is a great intellectual. He is also a great adventurer, a great party animal, a great judge of character, a great conversationalist, a great comedian, a great philosopher and a great self publicist. Indeed, Ashish Jain is rather of the opinion that if anything in this world is 'great' it must have his name on it and if it isn't, maybe he will try it anyway and make it great by the simple act of lending his name to it. Ashish is a Sagittarian and there are two things that no Sagittarian can resist. The first is a challenge. The second is a tendency to exaggerate. Therefore whatever Ashish Jain sets out to accomplish in this world must be: a) difficult and b) big. Why set out to climb a piffling little hill like Everest when there are mountains on Mars that are truly steep? All you need is a rope, a pick and a spaceship. In Ashish's mind, this (or something not far from it) represents a perfectly logical thought process. Who cares whether he actually manages to get to Mars? He will have fun trying and at least, if he tells enough people that this is his plan, nobody will ever think of him as boring. 
Here we have the essence of Ashish Jain's biggest secret fear. Ashish Jain is absolutely terrified that one day someone will rumble him. He will be revealed as an ordinary person who thinks ordinary thoughts. Oh shame of shames, what will he do then? To keep this dreadful possibility at bay, Ashish will go to any length, he will climb any mountain (even if it does happen to be on Mars) and he will swim any sea (even if he can't swim yet - he'll learn how to one of these days - you just wait and see). Or perhaps, more realistically (but only a bit) Ashish will set out to prove that he really is a great intellectual\adventurer\philosopher etc. etc. Much to everyone's surprise (including his own) in the fullness of time... it will all turn out to be true!

Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe thats the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like ""maybe she the wrong woman""
Think im'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
Im'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on

It was weird u know, I always thought she was the one for me, she was the one who ll stick, but meh i guess not, we just kept arguing over small things n just didnt have as much fun as we used to when we were friends, hell it was so weird that when we were fooling around, i kept feeling guilty, like i was doing something wrong.

Bah u d think i d be upset, u d think i d be throwing stuff around n smashing things but meh  cried the whole night, woke up today morning n i am normal or atleast i think i am. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet, like did it really happen, has it actually ended..i dunno, i shud be sad right now but i am not, i am just umm u cud say numb, i feel heartless, no feelings in me.

so wuts goin on , havent updated this thing in a few days eh; ahh well 

so nuttin much has been goin on wif me actually, i had 2 exams b4 this week, so was busy studying for them, dang i hate exam days, i always leave things for the end and always end up studying the whole night b4 the exam, its so stressful but blah

but hey this week is off, no skool, no homework , no shit, haha; SPRING BREAK!!!!!!!!!!


All alone, staring on
Watching her life go by
When her days are grey
And her nights are black
Different shades of mundane
And the one eyed furry toy
That lies upon the bed
Has often heard her cry
And heard her whisper out a name
Long forgiven, but not forgotten

damn i love this song, ahhh u cant possible listen to this song and not fall in love with the gurls voice and dayum! she so pretty, haha shes irish so u know wut to expect , bahh shes just purrrrrrrrfect haha:P
lol 

A bleeding heart torn apart
Left on an icy grave
In the room where they once lay
Face to face
Nothing could get in their way
But now the memories of the man are haunting her days
And the craving never fade
She's still dreaming of a man
Long forgiven, but not forgotten

bah i feel like so dreamy right now, like intoxicated or somefin, its weird but i am relxaed 
u know i havent heard anything from any of the universities i applied to , i am really worried now, ahhh

oooooooooooooh guess what guess what, Rach n Jody r having a underwear party at thier house next week after the midterms r over hahahaha, dayummmmmm i am so going to that party yo!, i can already see all those hot women in their underwear getting drunk hahaha dayummmmmmmm its gonna be such a  blast! haha its like high school all over again

I pull over, gettin busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my LOVE inside

Have you ever felt so alone that u sit back and look upto the sky n think if something happens to u right now would it bother anyone, wud anyone even notice that u r missing, would any1 shed even a single tear, would any1 pray for ur soul, wud anyone just take a deep breath and say in their heart that they loved u , would anyone stop infront of ur grave and put a flower on it?


Think about it what if NO is the answer to all those questions, wont it kill you even though u r still breathing, even though u have that friggen air in ur lungs and blood in ur veins, This feeling is so killing, it just makes u wanna put ur head in a pilow and scream, scream as loud as u can, scream ur lungs out but nobody can hear u, scream till u cry a river , scream bitch, scream ur fucking life out,uhhh S-C-R-E-A-M!!!

well i went to toronto for a few days to stay with juliana n her family. andy, kate,coy, and jenny also came with us. i thought it wud be a break from windsor, a much needed one i must say. the first day was pretty good but then like her mom turned into this evil bitcass punk. i dunno y though, she just completely changed and was a total bitch to me, and fuckin only me, she just used to be sooo cheesy to juliana and be like awww sweetie pie, and i dunno what other cheesy crap she used to call her n like she used to look at me when she did all that stuff as if to show me specially. well fuck you bitch. i wud have left after the second day but i cudnt cuz i had no ride.  

i think she was just trying to rub in the fact that i have no contact with my mom or dad at the moment which just totally fuckin pissed me. i wanted to tell juliana that i wanna go but i didnt, i just took it all in and somehow lived the next 4 days. i dunno y her mom wud do such a thing, i mean what did i do wrong to her, prolly she didnt like the fact that juliana was so friendly to me or it cud be prolly cuz i was the only non-white person there, well whatever it was it has just totally fuckin pissed me off tot he point that i am about to cry and its all cuz of my fuckin parents, if they had loved me the way they shud then i wud never feel this way , no fuckin bitch wud have had a chance to make me feel jealous or whatever.

i hope you burn in hell my dear dad and mom.

n i heard this song by linkin park called numb which isnt making things any better

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

[Chorus:]
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you 

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
An' every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Repeat]

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Repeat]

I've
Become so numb
I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be (x2) 

well fuck everything, fuck me, fuck my dad, fuck my mom, fuck the world, imma go throw something at the wall or break something cuz i am in that kinda fuckin pissed mood.

"event","Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
And it shines on you baby can't you see
You're the only one who can shine for me

It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Let your private emotion come to me
Come to me

When your soul is tired
and your heart is weak
Do you think of love
as a one way street
Well it runs both ways,
open up your eyes
Can't you see me here,
how can you deny

It's a private emotion that fills you tonight...

Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by
But you can find me here
till your tears run dry
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight... 

thanksgiving weekend is coming soon and everyone is talking about going home for the weekend. they all keep talking about how they havent seen their family since 1 month [sigh], umm hello its been over a year since i have seen my family and what makes it worse is that i dunno when i am gonna see them. 

Come the thanksgiving weekend and everyone will be gone to their homes but i ll be left behind still waiting for a chance to just see my family again, damn it seems like such a distant thing now, i dont like festive holidays, they suck so much ass that its not even funny.

i feel really lonely today, and damnit it seems like  today all the colder winds hitting only me....

i dunno how i am hanging on, i am about to give up, i really am, it just seems so unrealistic now, i am gonna break..........

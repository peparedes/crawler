"event","Yo, birds of the same flock together
Congested on a majestic dilemna
 no! no! no!My feathers and flames are one skin
Hallowed be thy name in the beginning there was no sin
We in the ninth inning, and i'm god body trying to win
Flying against the wind 
But now my shell is weightless and fireproof
But the truth is i'm proof of living fire
I'm not made of organics, not even wires
Just felt my body light up and heard the choir
See to the common fowl the phoenix is sire
Most high of all things to ever have wings
Existence is struggle, resistance is futile
Meanwhile we now possess the power of ten suns
To transcend and elevate into one
Famine, disease and senseless dieing is done
Pigeon bird got a breath leftHeart beat no more
Phoenix bird morph and we live off the g-force

the phoenix really is the most high of all things to ever have wings.
thats me
right now
i guarantee im smarter than anyone in this fucking state
and it sucks"

"event","yo it wasn't even like that
I wanted my cardiovascular to fight back
cupid had me runnin' circles blindfolded
in the daytime with a flashlight looking for her
yo, sit back, relax and smell the roses
a fly girl by any other name would still be that
but the trick is to see that
I'm caught in between future's fantasies and memories I played back
told my man I started sword fighting
'cause fencing was similar to tongue kissing
if you wait too long you gonna end up confessin'
all I think about is you undressin'
I extended my thoughts in a relationship
but they sunk like the titanic relation-ships
she was in a love triangle
but it wasn't like my feelings weren't there to make it a square
penny's for her thoughts
she's my very own American Beauty, red petals when we talk
...the f word

check this situation, I wore my lust like cologne
she called it Obsession
the background's black and white and we adolescents
like what the fuck we know about love?
the more I learn it's like the Clash of the Titans
all I wanna do is avoid fightin'
a little arguing's okay but not everyday
and if we can't communicate what we got decays
until the smell gets more pungent
to the point where we can't be seen in public
body parts fallin' apart, a symbol of what things do
or better yet, a symbol of what friends do, they die
and together forever just sounds fly
that's how it sounded to me when I heard it
and slow motion was her lips as she worded
the f word
""don't take it personal, I like you a lot but I don't wanna lose what we got""
but what we got now is friction
she tellin' me intimacy and friendship she ain't mixin'
the f word

yo, you burnin' the candle at both ends
I'm supposed to be the friend, I'm gettin' fried in the end
the big bang theory, what is this a trend?
you ask a girl out and the universe extends
tell me to talk to the hand again and I'll read your palm
I'm smellin' your shit now, don't know how to call
all I wanted was grounds for understanding
I ain't greedy, but to hold your heart I gotta put my hand in, why debate?
you think you can fit me in that anorexic space between love and hate?
I got all of the first one and none of the other
and that's something I learned from my sister and my mother
thought we was close in the genesis before all this
technology was cordless, a senseless courtship
this is more than just a song and when he's treating you wrong
I'm more than just a shoulder to cry on
the F word"

"event","The reception's gotten fuzzy 
The delicate balance has shifted 
Put on your gloves and black pumps 
Let's pretend the fog has lifted 
Now you see me, now you don't 
Now you say you love me 
Pretty soon you won't 
If we get our full three score and ten 
We won't pass this way again 
So kiss me with your mouth open 
Turn the tires toward the street 
And stay sweet 

All the chickens come on home to roost 
Plump bodies blotting out the sky 
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half 
When I see them trying to see them fly 
'Cuz you just can't do things your body wasn't meant to 
Hike up your fishnets, I know you 
If we live to see the other side of this 
I will remember your kiss 
So do it with your mouth open 
And take your foot off of the brake 
For Christ's sake!"

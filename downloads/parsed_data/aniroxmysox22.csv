Make me feel broken
Tell me what I should believe
I didn't know it was broken

I heard a distant early warning
But I chose to ignore it
It came back and bit me
Seems like we're victims of bad timing
Cause you wanted more than I did
I can't give you what you need

She's holding on while she can
Why'd we have to go and change things?
She's holding on while she can
Now touching you is such a strange thing
She's so out of hand
I'm dreading all the baggage and what it brings
She's so out of hand
But still I'd do it all again

"event","I don't know what to think anymore.
It's like a dead end. 
Everything is almost like a dead end. 
I, however, don't want college to come.
I'm in love with a pot addict.
And I think I like a gay boy.
I've never been so confused in my life. 
I thought I had everything figured out,
but it just had to go and get complicated on me.
Everything's changing and I want it to stop.
What do I do?
Do I leave it up to God to let him sort it out?
Or do I try and fix it myself. 
I miss the easier days, when life seemed to end just because you mispelled a word in a spelling bee.
I miss the summer a lot.
I miss not talking to the people I used to share everything with.
I've gained one of them back, 
and I want him in the way I can't have him.
We tried it once and it didn't work.
But I want to try again, however
it won't happen... maybe it's just not meant to be.
Maybe I'm supposed to be finding someone else.
However, I like being stubborn and I don't want to find anyone else.
I'm being selfish and immature, I know.
It's just life and I should deal...right?
what if I'm not ready to do that?
I just want something good to happen to point me in the right direction..."

"event","So I'm sick of it all. Sick of all of it. I can't wait for my fucking vacation I don't care that it's only for 2 days I don't care. The only thing I care is getting away from here. The state. getting away from the drama. Every where I turn there's the drama and I seem to create it all. So fuck it. I need to get away. It hasn't been much of a summer vacation. The first couple weeks were fun and now it's hell. I need to go away and figure shit out. My life is pretty much fucked at the moment and nothing makes sense. Nothings working out like it should. I should have my license by now, but no, no one trusts me enough. I should have a car. I should have people I can count on. To rely on to make me happy but I don't. Not today maybe tomorrow but I doubt it. Everybody's moving on, with jobs, with life and here I am waving goodbye to them. Goodbye life. I'll see you again maybe in twenty years!!! My lifes passing me by and nothing to show for it, except a better relationship with my brother who is 3... pathetic I know. See why I am looking forward to vacation? 
Maybe I should just go to sleep and not wake up for a while like not wake until tuesday morning in time to leave! Wouldn't that be a medical miracle? Well I'm out no more blogging fun for me."

"event","SO I am updating, It's been a while for a real update. It's kind of good, though, it's muchly needed. So yeah. It was raining and now it has stopped which is a shame. I <3 rain. Rain is perhaps the best thing on earth. :) It's supposed to rain some more later, and I can't wait. School's out, officially seniors. I'm not that excited. I have waited about 5 years for this to come and I'm not really ecstatic about it like some people are. It's too much to think about. I'm really sick of summer though and it's only just started. Whatever, it will end soon enough. 

Do you ever remember what it was like to be young and not worry about anything?

I went to go pick up my brother from daycare yesterday and I seen all these little kids just happy to be playing with each other and it was such a 'I wish I was young' kind of moment. I know you can't stay young forever, but I would like to go back and visit for a while. To not have to think about anything and just enjoy the time. It's probably something we all could use. Never have to worry about answering questions that you don't know the answers to, or can't find the answers for. You could just make it up and it was ok, because you were young and had  very little knowledge of life and what it really is like, all the hardships and the decisions. I just want to be done with all of it. Some days I feel like there is nobody or nothing there to help me make it through. Other days there's too many people there telling me different things and it's never what I want to hear. I just want that one person to be there and help me with things no one else can, and make those things better that no one else can."

Not like I would want to be outside right now anyways since it's like a cold 51 so ef that. Ashkea called me, asked me if I wanted to throw monday and I was like yeah whatever. It's kind of pointless. I will throw better than everyone else and not get a medal all because I am a junior woo-fuckig hooo but It will give me the practice for tuesday! Tuesday's the rescheduled meet against farwell and houghton lake so yeah, hopefully monday I will PR and then that will get me psyched for Tuesday. Tuesday's pretty much our last meet and it's at home (YAY!), saturday is regionals which I don't know exactly where they are... but anyways so yeah the season's coming to a close. School's over in like 9 days, everybody's pretty much leaving yearbook, sob sob. But it's all good, I guess in a effed up way. Hmmmmm... This year's been good, all in all.

Waste of time, it is kind of scary till you realize that her dad is raping her and she created the spirit to kick her own ass basically. It's stupid, I have decided that I don't feel like going into yearbook today. So I will call cieara and tell her that later. That would definitely be another waste of time, I want a day to do nothing and whatever I want at the same time and that's going to be today. After the movie last night we hit up arby's and talked about someone and her 14 year old boyfriend and how it's sagatory rape ha ha ha ha ha hhhhhhhaaaaaa. I have no clue what's gotten into her. but 14 is better than 22."

I hated being linked to Alizia second round cuz I always wanted to run a different direction and I would end up falling and this one random kid fell knock into my shins and I ended up falling over it was great. Then we ate and decorated the track and it looks sweet, I am not going to lie, it is awesome. Me and Alizia were doing cartwheels on the field and it was great.Tomorrow's nite trax! I'm excited. I am working shot put with Cosgrove. :) Quite excited. I can't wait. Everybody's going to be there I almost wish I was competeing but oh well! It's fun when you don't have to compete too though. Ashkea's running the two mile! I am going to cheer my head off! I love invites. Espicaly our own. It's lots of work there too! And TV 5 is going to be there. SO watch the news afterwards! LOL!

I feel accomplished. So accomplished. Missy threw a 98 Feet in discus and that's seriously phenominal. She placed 2nd and Ashley placed 4th in discus. and overall looking at the sheet I was in about 6th but places only go up to 4 but yeah 6th out of both harrison and clare is great. No more sucking! I got burnt too, on my shoulders quite happy about that! It doesn't hurt though, well not yet but yeah... I might be moving down the street from Alizia which makes me even more happier. I'm so giddy it's quite funny, I just love the way today worked out :) I was dressed up this morning all nice and pretty it felt good, had about 50 people tell me I looked nice, It just feels good.

"event","SO I have pretty much resorted to coming back to my Live journal. Myspace has become boring and I haven't found much time to converse with people. SO yeah lets recap last week. Monday was pretty much boring I think I don't exactly remember so yeah I think I went to practice and came home and that was the extent of it. Tuesday, came home from practice, took a shower, finished up some homework, called Cieara and she was still at the meeting and then like 10 mintues later she called back and was like when are we going to make our shirts? and I was like whenever so she came and got me and we went to the store and got shirts and paint and then went to her house and decorated them for ashkea. Mine said ASH and Cieara's said KEA and the front of mine said # 1 mustang and I think cieara's said go mustangs. They were pretty effing sweet. So I had to take mine home right. Got paint all over my pants and all over her car. It was pretty much a mess. Tottally a bad idear. 

But Wednesday at the meet was pretty good. I PRed in shot put by one foot, I was totally psyched about that. My discus pretty much sucked but I am seriously getting so good at discus now, I am throwing like 80's compared to my 48's at Gladwin Wednesday. I'm totally pysched for the meet this Wendesday. It's against Harrison and Clare so we will definitely need the points. So Cieara showed up at Gladwin on Wednesday and we sat on the end field cheering for Ashkea and Sean and Shelly and Jenny whom were all running the two mile. I was pretty much yelling the randomest things at shelly, like come on bag lady!!!!! It was sooo weird. We got yelled at that night for not cheering which I was. So whatever. 

Lets see Friday's meet was fun, went and took pictures while Ashkea filmed. It was pretty much the only way we could go since coach was irate about wendesday. So we went, and it was the funnest thing ever. I found stevenson's twin and took a picture of him. Everyone was pretty much shocked how much that kid looked like Stevenson. Then Ashkea had the volume way up on the camcorder so it pretty much recorded everything that we said. One time for instance we were at long jump and Heather was running and Ashkea was like Go Amanda! I mean heather... GOD DAMMIT! It was the funniest thing in the world. I was laying on the ground laughing my asss offf. It was great. The whole night was quite fun I have to admit and cold. I was a bit chilly. Then we went to Mc Donalds for food and ran across this busy road. We got like 6th place overalll which was pretty bad out of like 12ish teams that were there. But it was all good. 

Saturday morning had to go to yearbook, definitely needed work time and  so yeah Kyle was late picking me up. and then we went there for like 2 hours and worked and I was tired as hell not getting home till 1 and not going to sleep until 2 it was pretty wretched. and waking up at 8:30. urghhh so I was trying to right my story for my speciality layout and my brain was dead. so I watched sean work on his story and he eventually died too and then I looked at his layout which is pretty cool unlike mine which sucks! anyways then we left and kyle's like I need to go get socks for prom and I was like ok so we went to get him socks at JC Penny and we were going back to his car and he wouldn't let me in and he drove around the parking lot and I was like kyle!!!!! you asshole!!! and he eventually came back and got me. I was irate, but he made it up :)!!!!!! Definitely made it up so anyways I get home and decided I wanted to leave so I left and came back sunday in time for practice so I went and we were doing goal post throws and I was throwing one and sarah was shagging at the end field and I went to go pick up one of the disks she threw and she threw another one and it hit me in the back ooooooh boy did that hurt, it still hurts, I am hoping it will bruise that would be awesome!!!!! Then one of Missy's throws was chasing me down the football field, that was pretty much crazy. but my discus throwing is getting sooo much better I actually look forward to it :) Coach cole should teach us more :)Coach cole had us busting out laughing last night at practice. 
Today pretty much sucked like a monday. Mary and the band people weren't there neither were the seniors since it was senior skip day. Mary needs to get back. I miss her. I got my ACT scores back today :( a 22 I can do sooooo much better than that and my best was on reading with a 25 and I got an 8 on my essay. not bad. but not great. I need like 3 more points to be considered for U of M and two more to get accepted into msu. so I guess we will see what happens in the fall.

Here's my MP5 grades

Government-A
Spanish- A
ALg. II- A
Chemistry- A
American lit- A-
Yearbook-A

This non stop headache for a week now. and to top it off I can't find my headache log. so yeah I'm screwed when I go back to the doctors in like a couple weeks.

Sorry but I don't want to get eaten or attacked by random deformed people pissed off at the world. Nope. ain't happening. Never going to New mexico either. Really does make me wonder though why you would want to eat people or like animals. If your in a desert I guess theres not much else to eat but still... it's freaky. Annnyways spring break is here. We have the next week off. Didn't want it to show up but it's here... not much I can do to stop it. It will be a hard couple of weeks for me, but I will make it. Still confused also as to why certain things can't be easier. Lets take this into hypothetical mode. Lets say there was this guy/girl and you really like them. and your friends are telling you that they like you to, even though they don't know for sure. But from your friends observations they say that he likes you too. all in all the situation's stuck you like them but not sure if thye like you and they won't confront you about it. And they have to know that you like them because your friends are jerks and like to announce in front of everyone. So what do you do? Wait around, for them to confront you about it or try and move on or&nbsp;is it just his&nbsp;""pimp"" game?....&nbsp;I guess I am just really confused and can't really do anything about it if I&nbsp;was because&nbsp;*ding*&nbsp; *ding* spring break. Ah well. Moving on. I am the&nbsp;worst bowler in the&nbsp;world,&nbsp;highest game I have&nbsp;had in two weeks in 99.&nbsp;Pretty pathetic.&nbsp;Track's pretty much going the same.

So I tried to go back to sleep and I was actually succeeding in it to of course until my mom woke me up and told me to watch Dillon while Gary took her to work. So I fell asleep anyways and woke up and I was like shit where's Dillon? and he was still sleeping. so I ate a bowl of cheerios and then Gary was home and I went back to bed only that didn't work because Melissa called 3 times and no one bothered to let me know so finally I answered it and talked to her and while I did that I cleaned my room. Then after I got off the phone with her I went did the dishes. read. took a pill and fell back asleep and I didn't wake up till 30 minutes ago and I really didn't want to get up but I did anyways.

In chemistry we had to do this lab and I was partners with chelsea like usual and I went to grab one of the beakers full of some random compound and I wacked it against the head of the sink and I thought I broke it but I didn't but I spilled some of it into the other compound and what we were dooing was mixing compounds to see if they would react and well that one did. not majorly when I spilled it into the other compound it formed a percipitate. thank god we were done with the one compound I spilled it in. It was pretty funny actually. He was like Burt are you breaking my beaker? and last time in lab Chelsea broke the crucible so yeah. it was pretty much funny. American Lit vocab test was sooooo easy. I liked it. Even bobby was done like right after me and he really needed the good score to pass the class cuz last time she gave us grades he had like a 58 but yeah.</P>
<P>In yearbook ms lyon was all pissed off at us she was like you all are 3 months behind. You need to get your asses in gear. Your grades won't be pretty this marking peroid. which is true. we haven't really accomplished anything. and then Kyle wasn't there and he was supposed to find someone to take pictures on the spirit bus tonight for me. I was sooo angry when he wasn't there. But I asked Lauren to do and she said she would so yeah. no biggie. Me and Tyler started our sophmore layout. started and didn't get very far. I need to find some ideas for the story. and we need to get pictures. </P>
<P>I forgot to write about this yesterday but Bobby took me home yesterday and we had to go to his granmdas house to check on stuff because they are away and so we were coming back and there were like 50 turkeys crossing the street and bobby's brother was like HIT THEM HIT THEM! and he like stopped a foot away from them and blared the horn so they moved. It was funny. I have never seen that many turkeys before in one spot. Then today he brought me home and while we were at his grandmas house he was like trying to throw his brother out of the house because he was being difficult and that was funny. pretty amusing. </P>
<P>I have homework on a friday how stupid is that. thats very stupid in my opinion I will prolly forget to do it like I usually do. </P>
<P><EM>laughing with your pretty mouth. laughing wiht your broken eyes. laughing with your lovers song in a lulaby. where do you go when your lonely? Where do you go when your blue? where do you go when your lonely? I'll follow you...</EM></P>"

"event","Today was interesting. School pretty much sucked. Fell asleep in Econ, did absoultely nothing in spanish except talk to Allison about bands and music and listen to some pretty cool bands (cosgrove wasn't there) and lets see Math I have not a clue as to what is going on big surprise there! Everything he says goes in one ear and out the other. none of it sticks and from what I gathered its pointless. Chemistry oh more shit I have no clue what is going on and we have lab tomorrow and hmmm didn't bring my paper home to look over the lab. Oh well. huge vocab test in lit tomorrow that I have vaguely studied for. and an econ test tomorrow. ggrrreeaattt bound to fail. can't wait till this class is over. 4 more days.
 
This morning I didn't want to get up and my damned alarm clock song changes everyday. tuesday it was When I'm gone yesterday it was sugarcult I think.... and today it was 3 doors down again WTF it is messed up i guess it must be whats on my now playing list on my iPod once it's in there or something.... I'm done with technology, it gives me a headache. Like on DDR how the ef can you comprehend the steps on heavy seriously they are alllll half steps and its like one after one another its so impossible. Maybe my legs are just slow and demented... either way it pretty much sucks.

 tomorrow is the last day before the weekend, YES get to get away from here for like 2 and half days wooohoooooooooooooooo. I'm dumb and left all my cds at my grandmas house so thats where they be sittin. Billie Joe tells me that tomorrow is the 6th, I'm usually lucky on the 6th. That was totally random but that's okay I am gunsta go take a shower. and possibly study hundreds of vocab words.... yeah right.

I love you."

"event","Well how's it going peoples?

My last two days weren't bad. Yesterday I slept into like 9:30, Gary didn't go to work for some reason, oh well. I was quite happy. then today I'm home alone till about 5 and Tomorrow I will be home alone till at least 4 so I am good to go. quite lonely after a while. I was awoken this morning at like 10:30 by a pounding noise outside my window, scared the shit out of me whatever it was. It seems like so dead this time of the year outside. You don't see all the animals nor the people. I've only heard like 3 cars drive down the street when there is normally a lot more. It's kind of crazy. Like everyone's taking a break from life. Lonliness is in the air majorly. I've been watching One Tree Hill... still. I'm on the 3rd episode of season 2. Other than watching that and me and my iPod bonding not much has happened."

That pretty much sums it up, I might have left a few things out, but things have been interesting lately to say the least, supposedly my cousin Matthew almost died because he fell in some ice. He was snowmobiling on it and it died and went to walk away and it caved in but they got him out like two hours later and got his temerpature up. So yeah. Not too worried, even though I always knew that kid would be a problem. So I am looking forward to being locked in my room for the next week with my tv, ipod, computer, phone, playstation... too bad I have to babysit kind of puts a damper on things. maybe if I am lucky I can win the living room tv over from Dillon. I have spent like the last 7, 8 hors watching One Tree Hill and I have to admit it's my new favorite show... well pretty damn close I have like another 14 hours of one tree hill and a good 30 of Gilmore Girls and then you have to throw my ipod and books in there somewhere so like I said won't be too bored. 

Merry X-mas!!!!!!!"

"event","ok christmas needs to come fast. I want it over and done with already. I'm so tired of people telling me that I can't buy stuff because christmas is coming. WTF is up with that. I already know what like 2 of my presents are one being my GD hoodie and the other being my new keyboard. Angers me... Totally left my GD cd at my grandmas like last sunday and so I have had nothing to listen to, because all my other cds are way so over played. Yesterday really sucked I was like not home at all till like nine. Didn't go to bed until 10:30 and so today I am dead.... School really sucks. I have like lots of homework today and all I really want to do is go take a nap.
I was supposed to go to the basketball game tonight to get pictures for my spirit cheer layout but nope I defiantly have to stay here to watch Dillon because Gary's like not getting out of work till 6ish. He supposedly doesn't work this weekend so I can have my weekend, but you know everytime I make plans or something he ends up working so this time I'm not making plans, because I don't want to have to cancel them and I was supposed to go to a christmas party with my step mom this weekend but you know what I DON'T WANT TO GO! SO screw that. so haven't gotten anybody anything for christmas yet... Sigh... Have no clue what to get L-ren. Don't really have a clue as to what to get anyone really. 

19 days until christmas!"

"event","It's been a pretty good last couple days... Yesterday watched Dillon for waht seemed like forever then came into town sat around for about 2 hours then went to spend the night at Lauren's.

Funny as hell. Just funny. Not to metion the fact we listened to Bullet in a Bible what 50 times at least. Me singing. Talking to Lauren over AIM on her moms computer. Good times... Good times...

Today lets see woke up was strangely hyper. Then went home and then Lauren's dad took us to the mall. I bought one of the new GD tees from hot topic. A cd for my grandma for christmas and some hair spray at Target. Then a book called Lust at the bookstore. Come to find out the whole books about people wanting to have sex with other people. That's the plot of hte book. It's still surprisingly entertaining to say the least.

After the mall came home really felt like shit. Went to Midland to Kohls. Bought some rugs, and other random stuff got to solid long sleeve shirts to wear under tees since I always freeze my ass off at school.and yeah that was pretty much it came home, ate pizza and still kinda feel like shit. Ah it happens.need a bath or a shower or something, maybe that'll snap me out of this sick feeling..."

"event","<P>WEll yesterday was Thanksgiving and to all those who like thanksgiving happy thanksgiving. Personally I think it's an excuse for a holiday. we should give thanks everyday not jsut once a year. Anywho...</P>
<P>yesterday woke up to a random text message from Lauren. Went back to sleep and it was late so I got up got dressed, got online talked to Lauren a bit then I realized wow its getting even later and my mom starts doing my hair and what do you know theres this random knock on the door what do you know I get to go looking like a freak without my contacts in. Yeah so roads were prety bad got there like at 1130 and dinner was at 1230 we didn't end up eating until 1 and I spent the whole time in a chair observing people that were 2 feet in front of me becauseI couldn't see a damn thing past that. so we ate. It was nothing special..... then we played Anniversary uno? I think. It was pretty funny. ten time better than normal uno. You can get this card and play it and you get to give away all your cards but one. thats pretty sweet. I screwed my father over everytime just cuz we was sitting next to me I would like give him a draw 4 and a draw 2. Ha it was payback for him.....</P>
<P>After that left. Thank God. I hate people espically 40 of them when you can't remmeber all their names. yeah. I was glad to get the hell out of there. Came home. Ate again. WTF. and just sat around all night. Did the ninety thousand dishes. Swept the floor cleaned the living room. and yeah. That conculded my thanksgiving. Christmas is coming soon. kind of sucks. </P>
<P>So I have a question, why the efifng hell does someone say they like you but like never talk to you... or do anything to pursue their feelings seriously, its like they need to be shot. Pointless I Say! pointless!</P>
<P>A<BR>N<BR>Y<BR>W<BR>H<BR>O</P>
<P>Watching Dillon till like 4 then I get to leave and prolly spending the night at Lauren's house. <BR></P>

"event","wow haven't updated in forever. This week has been gay but short. Didn't have school tuesday because of opening of rifle season. That was gay. Yesterday didn't have school because of power outage. Even more gay. The only good part about yesterday was that it snowed. First snow of the season. Happiness. 
Today in school was really simple. Econ we finished watching Tucker. Test Tomorrrow. Spanish worked on dialogs for he whole hour and I read JV football stats to Cos so not much work there. Um Algebra. most surely the matrix. Freaky movie. Chemistry we are working on chemical formulas which suck in case anyone wanted to know that. Lunch was fun watching people on caffiene pills. Interesting.... american lit was gay we watched this boooorrrrring movie. Yearbook was fun actually ms lyon wasn't there. PARTY!!!!!!!!!! None of us did anything at all and thats pretty sad considering The principal was our sub. OH WELL! Life moves on. Like tomorrow for instance. I get to go to school. come home. go get my hair cut FINALLY! Then my moms taking me and Dillon out to dinner and then we are renting moveis. Pretty gay.................. I guess thats what happens when you don't have a life. You spend it with your little brother and your mom. Pathetic. Oh well I difenitely need to get my hair CUT!"

"event","oooh updating second day in a row. Today was eventfull though! 
School was borrrrring.
Econ- Random essay test I kinda did really bad on
Spanish- GAY! worst classs
Algebra 2- Dude we have like 4 foreign excahnge students I met Daniel from Mexico hes in my spanish test but then the chineese guy and the korean guy were in there and anywho we just did work gay work. 
Chemistry-quiz 7 out of 10 ouch! notes then homework
American Lit- Gayness we read a whole bunch of stupid indecipherable stories
Yearbook- Usual phone calls email to Lauren everyday stuffness
After school I went with Dennis, because we had that appointment with Chemical Bank and so we were walking out of yearbook and Kyle's like are you going out with Dennis and Im like NO and then hes randomly like you gusy should go out. ROFL anywho we go to Dennis's green Taraus. He made his poor brother sit int he back seat! roflmao. Anyways we dropped his brother off and then we went into Midland and it was like dead silent except for the occasional question are you feeling bad? yes. and how many ads have you sold? Blahty Blahty Blah Just that stuff so we get to main street and we go into the worng Chemical bank and so we had to go done the street further to the other one and then we go in and I talk to theinformational desk lady and she sends the ad lady down and then we talk. Dennis most surely saved my ass there.
Then after that he wanted to go visit his mom at the courthouse so we go to the courthouse and we walk into the door and we hear dennis cole! It was from the security person and it was funny. And so we go see his mom and then she takes us to see this secretary and they were talking about how hot the new security guards are and Dennis went red and then we left and then we went back down and stayed with the security people and he showed us how the metal dector works and the security cameras. and Dennis is like famous there everyone knows him it was so funny. So we stayed there for like a hour and then went back to his mom's office and she was in court and so we sat in her office and Dennis showed me like her schedule for the week and all the different court cases she is dealing with and it was really nifty. After a while we left and then drove home and Dennis is like well I don't think I have anywhere else I can take you excpept my aunt but she isn't working and that might be too gory for you and I was like why and he was like nevermind. 

So yes I got home and Dustin was home all alone like for a hour and Gary knew I have places to be so he virtually left his 10 year old child alone for an hour. WTF! God but it doesn't matter I called my mom and she knows where I was and everything so no big deal.

"event","This weekend was fun I guess Friday at the football game we sold 70 some tickets which was gay! Dennis's voice got so annoying I wanted to shoot him anywho. The dance was a dance. Missed Alizias surprise birthday party. Blah not my fault. 
Saturday was like sooooo fun picked up L-ren about like 2 I think and we went to kokomos my grandma gave us 40 dollars then left. So first off we play Lazer tag with this random little kids and it turned out Lauren's vest didn't work so like we got to go again and then this time there were these brat children in there that were hitting us with their guns and shit so we were like whatever and we left. 

So then we decide to go ride go karts well the damn kids were there again and like was next to him and he was like so what mission are you guys on exactly because we were wearing our 'on a mission' shirts and I was like shut up so like we go and the damn kid was behind me and kept bumping into me so I screamed Fuck off at him when he passed and so I can't find Lauren shes like a lap behind everyone and so we pull into the gates and leave. Lauren's like I was damn near ready to punch the faggots in the face. 

and so next we go play a soothing round of minature golf yeah well at like the 12 or 13 hole I lost my ball completely so we left 5 holes unfinished 

we decided to go go karting again and L-ren wanted to go double so I was like ok Ill drive. That was so funny. I was like purposedly trying to swerve and turn corners sharp to piss her off and so we get off and shes like Im never riding with you again but jee the kart was soooooo slow if it was faster then I could have done some damage. It makes me wish Dustin still had his. The go kart was better than the 3 wheeler because that damn thing pissed me off you would go to shift gears and it like wouldn't go.

After kokomos we went to walmart to get a cake and then we went home and dropped off Lauren only to pick her up an hour later to go to pondo. So she spent the night yep we played DDR a bit and then went to bed. OMG the funniest thing in the world some of the things that Lauren said made me want to die from laughing to death. You have not seen the real Lauren if you have not heard some of the things she said. Then yesterday! We get up eat waffles and we go downstairs and we start playing DDR and like Lauren's like I can't do la senorita on light its way to ahrd I always get E's on it at home and so she does it and SHE GETS A FREAKING C I was like yeah right your full of modesty. I know why! Shes got a brain transfusion with Tyler since he plays on heavy and he tells her where to move her feet and considering he was what 3 houses down it could have worked!

Today get to school all nice and hyper ready to run a marathon well that was crsuhed by second hour well some or it was the rest was crushed by the rest of the day. I love yearbook though seriously its the funnest class. Today we were supposed to call people and I was the only one who hadn't called anyone and yeah I got like 2 people to buy and thats it. Funny.

I'm debating whether or not to go to homecoming. any suggestions any, any at all?"

"event","LAST NIGHT ROCKED MAJOR ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SO many things happened I can't begin to even explain them. They opened with American Idiot. and then played Jesus of Surburbia, then Holiday and then I lost track but some highlights of the 2 hours go as following.
-Billie Joe having orgasim on stage and grabbing him and shouting 'will someone fuck me'
-Billie Joe making the crowd do the wave and having complete and total control over the crowd.
-Billie Joe flashing everyone his ass!
-The Band picking people to play the drums, bass and guitar. and the kid who played Billie Joe's guitar got to keep it!
- Billie Joe spraying the crowd with water
- The easter bunny before Green Day on stage doing the YMCA
- The fire was dead fucking awesome, one of the greatest things
- Billie Joe in the crown while singing King for a Day.
- All the older songs they played made me sooo happy: Hitchin a ride, Basket case, Longview, Minority, Good riddance, King for a day, 2,000 light years away, brain stew and I think I am missing a couple but it was soooo awesome to hear them played live
- Right before Billie Joe played Holiday hes like this song is a big fuck you to Bush and everyone screaming.
- Billie Joe saying he was George W. Bush when doing band introductions.

The whole concert was the best night of my life. Few people know that you can't explain that night with words.

The only bad part of all this was not getting home till 1 and having to get up at 6 but hell It was worth it and if going to that concert meant not getting back till 3 I still would have went and screamed my ass off.
I bought a shirt, and pins for my purse! So great! You have not lived life to the fullest until you have been to a Green Day concert!"

These past two days at school have blown completely I dispise Chemistry. Government sucks too Goff is crazy ill we had a quiz yesterday that I got a 104 on. I only missed one question go me! I have a Chemistry quiz on Tuesday and that will really suck. But school sucks in general. 

Today me and Lauren went to the mall I bought the second half of my grandmas birthday present and 2 magazines for the posters I have this hot poster of Billie Joe. It's great! I love him. I put a picture of Brandon Flowers in my planner. I just printed off this random picture and put it in there. Laurne and I also went on a bike ride today to the riverwalk. We didn't see anyone but hot running guys.

At the mall Lauren bought a watch and AP which has Fall Out Boy on the cover. Pete is hot. I am wasted right now and I haven't even had anything to drink. I guess it's the cocaine that I don't take. Ok I guess this is the end of my entry."

"event","First day of school. Funness! I got up at 6:25 to my lovely sounds of Basket Case. Go Green Day!

So anywho my schedule goes as the following:

1st Economics - Goff
2nd Spanish 3 - Cosgrove
3rd Alegbra 2 - Mc Gillis/ Ferency
4th Chemistry - Cicinelli
5th Am Lit - Prout
6th Yearbook - Lyon

Yep I didn't even sign up for chemistry. Rofl. Econ first thing in the morning kinda blows. I didn't want Spanish 3 but I thank the lord it is with Cosgrove and not Lopez. I hate Lopez. I don't have her this year thank you goddess. I have allison in like my Econ and Spanish and Am lit class. It's great because she's my only friend in spanish its basically filled with the preppies so I told her she couldn't leave me since she was planning on switching, considering she didn't pass spanish 2 rofl. Algebra 2 no one is in there I remotely care about. Chemistry, blah just blows plain and simple. No one in there really. I have second lunch with all the freshemens and the sophmores. The only good people in there is Tyler and Kerrie. American Lit is fun fun class though. Lets see theres Bobby, Dani, Alizia, Shayna, Eric and lots of other people the class has sooooo many people. Austin is in that class and he is the loadest person ever that wants attention but he sits at the only table in front of the room. Then yearbook I have with Tyler who cracks me up and Dennis is now on staff too imagine that. Lauren has to put up with him in the morning and I have to put up with him in the afternoon. Quite hiliarious if I do say so myself. I got 4 out of 5 of my books today and tomorrow I get my Alg. book. Funness! 

Today I came home from school to watch Dillon oh the bus is horrible but anywho I watched Dillon then I had to fill out my letters for yearbook and then I did the dishes and then we went to dinner at Sanford Bar and Grill for Taco night where I seen Bobby! How ironic."

"event","so Friday didn't go to Laurens because no one called... no biggie It was alll made up for yesterday.

saturday grandma woke me up at 10:30 and she was like you got to get up Lauren's thing is in a couple hours and I was liek yeah yeah yeah so I got up showered all that stuff then headed out to Laurens. Lauren decides that we aren't going swimming so ok no big deal. So Brittany, Lauren and I all went to go see Red Eye. At first I was like WTF this is stupid but it turned out being funny. Then ending was so predicitible. I mean come on everyone will be saved except for the bad guys. Anywho so Laurens mom comes and picks us up and shes talking about Lauren's grandparents anniversary dinner that evening and Lauren is like Mom can Sam come with us and shes like you have to call your grandmother and ask her.

So we get back to Lauren's house and we hang out and eventually Brittany's ride comes and so me and Lauren are sitting there and she calls her grandma and asked if I could go to dinner and she said yeah. So we hung out for a couple hours and then left for her grandparents house. We get there and drop off their present stuff and then we go to bob evans. That was seriously liek the most fun I have had at dinner in a long time. Lauren's aunt OMG is seriosuly sooooooo funny. I don't think there was a time during that dinner when I wasn't laughing. It was soooo great. my favorite story was the one about Lauren's dad when he was three thinking that his new baby sister was his birthday present since their birthdays were so close together. that was great. I was soo sad when we had to leave...

Anywho I came home. Did nothing really. Finished my book and started another one and went to bed. today I go home at 2 and the phone stil ahsn't been shut off. Kewl beans!!!! Yearbook meeting at 12:30 tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!! :("

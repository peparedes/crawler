"event","<p>yaOH MY LORD.<br /><br />The past weeks were ohmygod, <strong>awesome and crappy </strong>at the same time.<br /><br />But before all that, lemme tell you&nbsp;that the last entry I did, which was <a href=""http://annablanx.livejournal.com/9013.html"">THIS</a> one ( you have to be logged in to view it cos I made it into a Private Entry), made me smile. Why? I've no idea. It just made me.. y'know.Well honestly, the reason it made me smile was cos I finally was able to&nbsp;channel all the negativity in that entry into more positive ones. :) To be more concise and clear, after that shit talk we had, God was so good that it made the both of US okay. and by&nbsp;OKAY means <strong>we're-sort-of-dating-but</strong>&nbsp;..Okay? HAHA! (No, we're no couples, we're just.. y'know.. in that stage of&nbsp;friends with benefits thing..&nbsp;<em>ay ambot ah</em>..)&nbsp;<br /><br />He finally made it clear. I was relieved. But my God, It was hard playing mind games with him. I'm glad he finally confessed. :)<br /><br />I told myself to be happy of the moment and try&nbsp;not to think of what lies ahead of us. The future is out there, yes.. but all WE have now is the present. I'm happy, he's happy..we both are and I think that's what makes it sort of complete. Coz for me, the best part of being inlove is when you just love a person and be happy about it even if that person can never be yours and even if you know it can't last forever. It's about being guiltless cos you never stole anyone from anybody. Wala naman kasi akong mga taong tinatapakan at nasasaktan sa ginagawa ko, just like what my ever so loving </p><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://limitedpalette.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://limitedpalette.livejournal.com/""><b>limitedpalette</b></a></div>&nbsp;told me. So, here I am. Cherishing every minute of everything with him. :) ..and I'm going to continue&nbsp;this until God knows when. Even if it means being stupid.&nbsp;Even if it means getting hurt in the end. Cos getting hurt in love means you're doing it right. It's about inner happiness. <em>Hindi ako matututo pag hindi ako nasaktan..</em> Besides,<em> steady lang naman ako eh. Kung nandiyan sya, edi andyan. Kung wala, edi wala. </em>I'm just not investing too much on it. I'm also trying my best to guard my feelings towards him. <em>Wala naman ksi rin kaming pinanghahawakan eh.. Masaya lang talaga ako ngayon. Ipagkakait ko pa ba ung happiness na yun sa sarili ko?<br /><br /></em>I was with him 2 Saturdays ago. We went to school together. It was also, the first time he held my hand.. in public. :)<br /><br />I'm happy. Really. Nothing could make me happier. So happy that infact, when he came over last Sunday naman, here at home, dad was even&nbsp;super NICE to him! :) <em>Hala!? Happy din kaya si papa??</em> haha! Geez, I wonder why! :)<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""wait lang, let me tell you about Sunday"">It was really&nbsp;sweet that he went here at home last Sunday to visit me. It was the first time he went over after all that happened. He was all smiles when I got to him at the gate. Aww. Very very far from the guy that I knew before.&nbsp;:)&nbsp;<br /><br />He was very school-boyish with his back pack and all when I got to him at the door. <em>Ang cute nga eh.</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />He brought his laptop along so I could copy songs from his list and he could too from mine.&nbsp;<em><br /><br /></em>We hanged out, talked, ate, watched Shrek 2 and laughed like there was no tomorrow. Aww..&nbsp;He&nbsp;went home&nbsp;when all the stars couldn't be seen from the night sky anymore..just like as always. :)<br /><br />There was just something different with him that day. I swear. ^__^<br /><br />Ayun.. :) He told me that he missed me so bad..so bad that he wanted to..<br /><br /></div><br />anyway, Oh and did I tell you? <strong>Pia,</strong> my bestfriend, and I finally got to catch up on each other last Thursday! I missed her so much!! It was pure catching up at Gateway over at Coffebean. Pure <strong>CHIKAGALORE </strong>if I must say. Then we watched <strong>Tenacious D</strong>, which was an abso<em>fuckin</em>lutively hilarious movie starring <strong>Jack Black</strong>. It was FUNNY! I tell you!&nbsp;GO and watch it before all the cinemas go on <strong>Manila Film Festival</strong> mode. :)<br /><br />Hmmm but of course,&nbsp;if I got to catch up with my bestfriend, I got to catch up with 2 of my HS barkada friends as well! Gina and Mai!!! OH-EM-GEE I UBERLY MISSED THEM! :D We bonded at Gateway again yesterday. Yung kahapon&nbsp;naman, sobrang LAUGHTRIP! It was the first time I saw them again since.. Iono, since last year?!? It was indeed GIRL bonding! With Gina's BOY GEORGE stories and guy problems and Maimai's ""crush"" problems too, ay jusko.. nakakaloka! :S<br /><br />Then,&nbsp;<br /><br />HE dropped by at around 5 and we both got to catch <strong>Borat</strong>! WAHAHAH! another laughtrip movie. It was a fun but stupid movie but who cares! Gah! It was even more fun cos he was with me. Awww.. kinda reminds me of that <strong>Nacho Libre</strong> date we had a few months back then. Hee hee hee. ^___^&nbsp;<br /><br />Him: <em>Yan kasi, puro panglalalake ang inaatupag.<br /></em>Me: <em>Ang tanong, lalake ka ba??</em><br />Him: <em>AHEM AHEM</em><br /><br />haha! &lt;3<br /><br />Oh wait, I got something really nice with that stupid movie..<br /><br /><em><strong>""If you catch a dream, especially the ones with plastic chests, you miss out on the people who reflect the true essence of beauty.""</strong></em>&nbsp;<br /><br />or something like that, ewan nakalimutan ko na eh.. but it's really nice when you think about it. hehehe!<br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />Christmas is just around the corner. To be quite honest, it's only NOW as in<strong> this MINUTE</strong> that I felt the Christmas air.. :) Quite sad actually.&nbsp;but hey! as the CloseUp jingle says... <strong>It's the season of smiles</strong>. :)<br /><br />Christmas for the Blanco's will be slightly different this year. No christmas decors, no christmas tree in the living room, no christmas gifts (yeah, crap i know) no noche buena, no mom to be there (she's still in the States). It's just US. Me, Dad, my brother and sister gathered together to celebrate the Christmas year.&nbsp;Sad, I know but everything has it's own reason and I know God planned that for us this year. Who knows? Right? Maybe next year we'll be celebrating Christmas in a.. different country perhaps? :)<br /><br />Moving on,<br /><br />I officially am SICK of ORDERING IN breakfast, lunches and dinners. Since the maid left, We've been having them for 3 WHOLE WEEKS already. Jollibee, Pizza Hut, McDo, KFC.. ARGH!!! MAN, I miss home cooked food! :( I miss mom's sinigang and adobo! I miss smelling&nbsp;porkchops and bangus! GRRRR..&nbsp;Seems like it'll be US and STYROFOAM PLACED lunches till mom comes back Januray 2 next year. ARGH.. YOKO NA NG DELIVERY!!!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />OH AND WTF?! THAT FRIGGIN MAID STOLE MY 2 TEAM MANILA SHIRTS WHEN SHE LEFT.<br /><br />The nerve of that chipangga.

"event","kamusta naman yung bagyo diba? &gt;__&lt;<br /><br />i wasn't really expecting that a day worth of rain'll cause Manila to be completely, paralyzed. Dayum! Even the biggest of the biggest trees at Mckinley got uprooted cause of that 6 hour storm. Bigat.<br /><br />and by PARALYZED, I mean, completely PARALYZED.&nbsp;We were fortunate enough to have our water, lights and phone back only after&nbsp;a day. Some of you guys, I think, are still UP TO NOW (3 days pag nabasa nyo na to) havn't got their electricity back on yet. and that's quite sad while I'm here sitting comfortably here at home, with the lights, and the phoneline and the water to keep me cool, back on as I'm ranting my woes for the past 3 days&nbsp;here on LJ. HEHEHE.<br /><br />Yesterday, after a day's worth of rain, I went to Greenbelt with a friend to laze around. IT was THAT boring at home to keep me away from it after the BAGYO. Lucky enough, classes were still suspended so we were able to LAMYERDA all we want. Hehe. But even before the fun started, I GOT PISSED with what I saw just when I was about to step off the SHANG-MRT connector..<br /><br /><strong>""SARADO PO ANG MRT""</strong><br /><br />Punyeta. How was I supposed to get my boring butt off at Ayala when the supid MRT's down?!<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""the whole story, kung may tiyaga kang magbasa ng mga reklamo ko haha"">So I went down and decided to just take a cab but to my disgust, people WERE also lining and piling up to&nbsp;take &nbsp;the same thing I'm taking. Takteng yan&nbsp;badtrip!! I ended up ranting to Kasoi through text that I'm stuck at Shang waiting for a cab cos the stupid MRT's down. Takte.&nbsp;<br /><br />I decided to just wait for her at Starbucks pero MAAAAN if you think that was through, THINK AGAIN.<br /><br />IT WAS SCORCHING HOT AT STARBUCKS KASI WALANG AIRCON.<br /><br />at kamusta naman yun diba?!?!?!? pero I have no other choice but to wait for her there. Buti na lang after an hour and a half, she got to Shang and we took the cab she was riding down to Makati. At kamusta naman yung aircon ng cab, ANG LAMIG...... :)<br /><br />So there, that was even before we got to Greenbelt. Imagine our haggard looks the moment we stepped off at Greenbelt. Shucks nakakahiya.<br /><br /></div>
<br />Anyway,<br /><br />Kasoi and I movie marathoned last night. Hehehe. Step Up and John Tucker Must Die baby! :) and WE LOVED IT. Screw that someone who said that Step Up was dragging. Nyahaha!! For me, it wasn't cos I obvously LOVED the film by the way I bopped my head everytime! hahaha! mapapasayaw ka tlga eh.. :) and OH HOW I MISSED BAR NIGHTS WITH THE GIRLS. :( sigh. at kamusta naman si&nbsp; Channing diba! NAKAKAINLOVE SIYA MAGSAYAW! I absolutely had no IDEA that HE CAN FUCKIN DANCE. GRABE I could've never guessed that that hunky player on She's The Man can dance just like.... WHOA!! nakakainlab talaga.<br /><br />John Tucker was good too! Ang kulit sobra! :) I just didn't like Ashanti there. Parang hindi kasi siya bagay dun eh hahah! and the movie taught me ALOT. I swear..<br /><br />so ryt now, I'm currently INLOVE with the soundtrack of both movies! ESP with John Tucker's! Hehehehe! I especially loved Ben Lee's version of my favorite Modest Mouse song ""Float On"" :D<br /><br />Oh well anyway, I'm supposed to be at some bar in Ortigas tonight cos Fritz invited me to his bday but things started to crap the whole afternoon which prompted me to be on my full blast ""TAMAD MODE"" tonight. He. He. He. HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRITZ!!!! :) Pupunta na lang ako sa Beda to visit you there pag may concert. Nyahaha. :P<br /><br />Oh and I got to pass by M1 with Kasoi and BOYYYYY do I want Spongecola's TRANSIT and Imago's BLUSH album! and even EEP!! <strong>Callalily</strong>'s!! Oh meeehn!! and those newly repackaged Itchyworms' Soapdish's Sugarfree's Spongecola's (Palabas) albums! Kasi may videos na kasama yun eh! Haha! *drrrooooooool*<br /><br />So there,&nbsp;<br /><br />Wlalang. Despite of that freakin rain and my <strong>lovelife problems</strong>, I still had some fun. You should've too! :)<br />"

"event","<p>Lapit na finals <strong>shyet.</strong> Hagardness na naman itu. Actually, it's sort-of finals week na nga eh cos the remaining weeks are alotted for finishing them final projects. Sheesh. But atleast, we've no more lessons to discuss. Heehee.<br /><br />It's finals week and I'm still slacking my head off. Heehee. I'm constantly munching on mediocrity and savouring each and every pure bliss. RAR. Putangina ang tamad ko at dapat lang eh napapmura ako sa situwasyong ganto. WAKE UP ANNA. WAKE UP MORON. WAKE UP BIZATCH.<br /><br />Here are my list of things to do for finals week:<br /><br />1. The iPod Video 2 column script corporate video that's due this Tuesday for Scripwri<br />2. The bookstore texturing for Canim2 due on the last week of August.<br />3. <strike>Scrapbook </strike>and role-playing for History. (term paper din ata, I think. He still hasn't discussed it yet.)<br />4. 3 studies of surrealism artworks, 5 textures, fire and raindrops (<a href=""http://www.photoshoptechniques.com"">www.photoshoptechniques.com</a>)&nbsp;for Digilus.&nbsp;<br />5. Residence Inn website for Webpage.<br /><br />There. I still don't know when the Scripwri makeup class is. PATAY. I lost track of it. Geez. Speaking of Scripwri, I almost lost my iPod Video script for it. Shet. Good thing I rummaged through my own pile of basura yellow papers lying around my cabinet. Heehee. Hirap talaga pag burara. Tsk. I can feel Bessy Basura through my veins. Seriously. It's ticking me off sometimes. I wish I was OC!!!! Grrrr.<br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />It's finals week and I'm more compeled to do my HAIR rather than my school works. HAHA. I'm seriously thinking of changing my hair YET AGAIN to something much more RADICAL. Hehe. I just want to look different at least once in my life. Hehe. Anu nakain ko? Wala. Harhar.<br /><br />See this?<br /><br /><img alt="""" img="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v653/annablanx/hair.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Yep. Yan. Ganyan. Mismo. Tumpak.&nbsp;Blue or maybe red like Kelly Osbourne's.<br /><br /><a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/38051000/jpg/_38051104_kellyosbourne.jpg""><img height=""186"" alt="""" width=""150"" src=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/38051000/jpg/_38051104_kellyosbourne.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />But having that hair means having to dress the part. So.. maybe before I get my haircut that way, I'd invest on some clothes to match the hair first. Hehe. Pucha exciting itu! What do you think? Hehe.<br /><br />O diba mas excited pa kong ikwento yun kesa sa finals week?<br /><br /><font size=""5"">NAMAN!<br /></font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>Last night, Faus and I went to Ralph's bday celeb/ exhibit at Penguin Bar, Malate. Joriz and Mike were there and I got to meet Ziggy and Carlo (carlita? hehe) and alot more people whom I forgot the names. Hehe. Sorry, mental gap. :P But I do remember their faces, it's just hard to add names to those faces. Hehe. :) but anyway, Happy Happy Birthday to Ralph! :)<br /><br />It was raining mad last night and I know it's weird to say this but it was amazing. :) HAHAH!! You know why? Cos when it's raining, expect that some of the streets in Manila are&nbsp;flooded. And FLOOD = LURV. Hahaha. :) Fak. that&nbsp;doesn't make any sense. Hahaha. Ewan. I just love watching the flood. Especially when you're inside the car and you drive through it. Hahaha. Amazing! PWEH. Hahaha. I dunno, somehow I get emotional when it's raining.. and sometimes when it's flooding too! haha!&nbsp;I just get shitty about the rain when I commute&nbsp;to school. FAK. But when I watch the rain from inside the car or inside the house, wala I just get sooo argh.. feely. Seriously. Nadadala ng ulan ang mga emosyon ko. Whiii. Adik.<br /><br />Despite of all the laughtrips Joriz, Mike, Faus and I (ziggy and carlita's also) made last night, I was just so down. Mainly cos of my personal problems. :( Masyado ko ata dinibdib lahat ng problema ko kagabi. But nonetheless, I still had fun even if it hurts inside. Uyy. Hehe. :(<br /><br />My mom said something to me regarding her health and why she's sick lately. Yes guys, my mom's sick. and I dnt knw what to do. :( I dnt even know why she's sick cos she wont tell me. The only thing she told me last night when I asked her why she's puking everytime lately is that ""wag ngayon Mak, sa susunod ko na lang sasabihin sayo.."" WHO WOULDNT GET PRANING ABOUT THAT?!?!??! Grrrr.. :'''(<br /><br />That's my 1st problem.. and this is the second.. <br /><br />When I got home, I opened the laptop and logged-in to my ym account and SURE ENOUGH, he was there. Great. Just great. That's just what I needed..NOT! :(</p>
<p>I was happy he was there and sad cos he's there. Ika nga ng stat ko at ng song ni Paris Hilton na Stars are Blind eh.. ""I'm high and low."" Sigh. And yes, he endured 1 hour not talking to me. It was okay. I was fine with it. It was really what I wanted naman.&nbsp;Hindi naman siya nagpaparamdam, hindi na siya tumatawag, hindi na rin nagpapakita so I was basically USED to it.&nbsp;<br /><br />But after that hour, he pm'd me and was saying sorry that he ddn't notice I was there. Sheesh. Palusot?<br /><br />The conversation turned to be great naman for the first few minutes but turned sour (for him haha) the next. You know why? COS I RUINED IT. HAHAHAHAH!!<br /><br />He was happy that he was finally talking to me again but I asked this question that bugged him.<br /><br /><em>""Si **** ba yung constant quotemate mo at nanghihingi ka ng quotes sakin?! (wtf quotemate. haha)""</em><br /><br />Ayun. Biglang nag-goodnight and left. Bwahaha. At siguro hinihintay niya na magtext ako or tumawag ako para amuhin siya but no.. sorry siya nakahanap siya ng katapat. :P&nbsp;After 20 minutes, my cell beeped and sure enough it was him saying sorry and asking me not to tease him to her again cos he's only missing her more. Sus. Ano naman ngayon sakin?! Hehehe.. but you know what, I felt guilty. Medjo. Haha. Haaay. Bahala na nga si Batman. I said sorry too and told him I missed him para pampalubag loob. Bwahaha!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Napapisip na rin kasi ako na ayoko na ng ganitong feeling. It's just hard to hold on to something you know you can't have. It's a slow death..and a mocking torture to yourself. Diba? He's still attached to the feeling he had before abt the girl but I dunno.. am I waiting for him to give up o her? TAKTE.&nbsp; OO. Shet. But I hope I get over that. Ayoko ng naghihintay. Lalake lang gumagawa non. :P Wow.

Hehe. Seryoso.) pero sabi ko naman, under warranty pa yun, sayang naman kung hindi ko papalitan. Kaya yun. Pagkatapos ng 2 hanggang 3 linggo ko pa makukuha yung earphones kasi daw kukuha pa sila ng panibago sa Singapore. Wirdo lang, kasi akala ko kukuha lang sila ng panibagong set ng earphones sa stockroom nila sa likod. Hihihi. Ayun. Hindi pala. Akala ko rin nga,&nbsp; pagkatapos ng 2-3 weeks ko rin makukuha yung iPod mismo eh, kasi naman yung saleslady dun, parang ayaw bitawan yung iPod. Akala ko kasama rin sa service nila na kunin yung iPod mismo. Yun pala, Ipa-plastic lang pala niya yung iPod para nga naman hindi ako mahirapan bitbitin pauwi. Ayun, na-tanga na naman ako. Hihi.<br /><br />Nakasabay pala namin yung kliyente ko. (yes, pormal eh noh) Si Ms. Ellaine. Nakabangga kasi namin siya ni itang (haha!) sa National nung bumibili ako ng gamit pang-eskwela (bolpen, papel at magazine..oo gamit pang-eskwela rin yun).&nbsp;Kaya ayun, sabi ni tatang (wahah!) isabay na rin daw namin sa pag-memerienda si Ms. Ellaine. Yun. Kumain kami sa Deli France. Yun lang. At&nbsp;as usual, walang katapusang hiritan na naman kaya tawa na naman kami ng tawang tatlo. Astigas noh? Parang barkada kami. Wahaha. Aylab Miss Ellaine. :D&nbsp;<br /><br />Haaaay.<br /><br />Ayun.<br /><br />Lalang.<br /><br />Wala pala akong asignatura (homaygad lalem) para next week. Kaya waw ang saya.. Wala akong ginagawa.

""Naipitan"" lang daw ako, according to my mom so she brought me to a witch&nbsp;doctor. (takte eh noh, WITCH DOCTOR. tama ba? Sige na nga, MANGHIHILOT)&nbsp;but the thought that I spent 3 days.. 3 PRANING-ful days thinking whether I'm having the disease already wasn't FUN. It was&nbsp;mortifying. There are times wherein I'd stare blankly into space, contemplating on the ""disease"" I ""had"" and thinking of what excuse I'd give to my professors when I come back to school. Haaay. Oh, and..&nbsp;Can you imagine, 3 days without me TALKING? Garabe. Praning. I was possessed. Haha.<br /><br />I ditched Webpage class last Monday cos I wasn't REALLY REALLY feeling well. I only attended Canim2 cos it was my midterms and cos my professor's tough (Iono, I think he is lang. Si Sir Siytangco, do you know him guys?) and I've zilch idea if he was to give me a make-up midterm exam. So ayun, I still attended my 8am Canim2 class and endured the travel on my way to school. I was about to black out on the way to school nga eh. Sa MRT men. :( Good thing I grab hold of the pole next to me kundi nako.. goodbye world.&nbsp;Keeedeeeng. :) but yeah, that was the worst&nbsp;train ride I had for 3 years. There's was no one to accompany me either so it was ME and my battle with my fever. Haay.&nbsp;<br /><br />Imaginin niyo kung hinimatay ako sa loob ng mrt noh?<br /><br />Oh well,&nbsp;<br /><br />When I got home at around 2:30, I felt better. It was only during dinnertime that my temperature started to reach 38 degrees. Weird nga eh, it was always at night that my temperature rises.. continuous yun for 3 days. Eeek. Anu may mumu na ba na sumapi sakin??? :(<br /><br />Ayun.<br /><br />But I still attended my&nbsp;6pm Scripwri&nbsp;class the next day. of course, being the chickenpoxpraning that I am, I had to attend class. The reason why I still kept on attending class despite of my fever&nbsp;is that&nbsp;if ever my brother ""shares"" his virus with me, I still have 2 weeks (2 absences, 1 late)&nbsp;to excuse myself from class since chickenpox's last for 2 weeks. Oh diba mautak. Hehehe.Pero eto yun eh.. Had I known earlier that we only have to get our revised scripts that day (and that&nbsp;we've no&nbsp;Scripwri class)&nbsp;I wouldn't have gone to school. :( Kawawa naman ako. Kaya ayun.. I felt the chills again when I got home. :(<br /><br />Wednesday was great though cos I had no class. Ayun. Rest day galore ako. It was raining too so classes were suspended.&nbsp;My sister and I spent the day doing nothing. Ganda noh?<br /><br />Yesterday was AWFUL. It was the BORING-est day of the week. Since my brother came home from the hospital last Monday, he had to recuperate the entire week at my parent's room with the TV, with the DVD player, with the LAPTOP, with the PHONE,&nbsp;with the BED. In short, with all the luxuries in the world. Ay hindi, luxuries in the Blanco residence lang pala. GRRRRRRR.&nbsp;<br /><br />Siyempre, hindi naman kami makaakya ng sister ko sa room cos HE WAS THERE. Haha. Sama eh noh. Hindi, ayaw lang namin mahawaan. :( Kaya tiis kaming walang ka-ekekan sa buhay. All we had downstairs at the living room was my iPod and the speaker. and the folding bed. Wow. Fabolous. 3 days ha. 3 days yun. May sakit na nga ako tas ganun pa. Waaah.<br /><br />Good thing <span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />faus</span> called. Napawi ang boredom galore ko. :) Ehehehe. I had time to burn the lines with him cos I was feeling A-OK already. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Ayun.<br /><br />That was my week. Saya noh?<br /><br />Oh and, over the week too, I realized that I liked someone. But got rid of the feeling last night. Haha. WAW bilis.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've to meet up with Kaye at 3pm this afternoon to accomplish our yearbook forms so ciao. :)<br /><br /></font></font></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""good morning sunshine""><br />Walalang. I woke up early cos Kaye called me to ask if there was metallic printing at Studio 58 where I had my contact prints printed last term. I told her it was toooo expensive. Kaya ayun, sa Astoria na lang daw. Bwahaha. Now, why am I saying this? Kasi umagang umaga, pinapaisip ako ni Kaye kung san pwede magpa-print. Wahaha. As in groggy pa boses ko at lutang pa isip ko. Wah. Hahaha. Nag-stick na tuloy sa isip ko yun. Labyu Kaye. Hahaha.<br /><br />Obviously, I couldn't get back to sleeping so I opened the laptop na lang. (buti iniwan ni Papa yung laptop. I think he went to play golf eh. Kaya wala siya sa office ngayon. Hmm..) I was supposed to convert FD3 to my iPod pero ang tagal mag-convert kaya to hell, I just downloaded another batch of songs from the Laguna Beach soundtrack. I started last night eh. Hehe. Kaka-inlab Laguna Beach. Hekhek. I had songs from the soundtrack way before pa but I wanted more. Haha. Ayun. :P<br /><br />I've watched <strong>Click </strong>yesterday. Gwapo pa rin ni <strong>Adam Sandler</strong> eventhough he's old and you can see wrinkles on his face. Bwahha. Fyi, he's my uber favorite actor of all time aside frm Ben Stiller. :) Hehehe. The story was nice. The movie was great I even cried sa dulo ng movie. Bwahah. Mababaw lang talaga siguro akong tao noh? Na kahit comedy eh naiiyak pa rin ako. Haaay. Go watch Click. It's a great film. :)<br /><br />I went home early yesterday from my 8am class (which something new.) cos I wasn't feeling well. I literally thought it was BULUTONG na cos I had nothing in mind but chicken pox now. :( Buti na lang hindi. (i think?! WAAH) Kulang lang ako sa tulog tas ang init pa kahapon kaya medjo down yung feeling ko which I found weird cos I was all giddy later that morning. I was even joking around with Kaye and with all the people I saw (duh parang bago un eh noh) Haaay. But I'm okay now. No worries.<br /><br />My brother will be home on Sunday.&nbsp;<br /><br />anoooo..? Doomsday ko na ba sa Sunday?! WAAAAH..<br /><br />I'm chatting with JmC and Edward over at YM now. WAH. Gulat ako nag-message si Ed! Wow. Buhay pa pala si Ed. :) Nakakmiss siya! Siya kasi parati ko kasama pag Fotogra last term eh. :) Awww..We agreed to take Videopr, Ecommerce and Canim3 next term. Ayan kasama ko na ulit si Ed! Hehe.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ayun. Wololong.<br /><br />It's my midterm exam in History later and I haven't even flipped my notes yet. Bwahha. Katamad eh. Siguro later na lang.. Wahaha. May siguro eh noh?! :P<br /><br /><br />Gudlack to meeeh. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>"

"event","<p>Before I start this, let me just say that you guys should pray for my brother. He has chicken pox and it just started last night. He's in the hospital now cos my dad wanted him to be isolated so as not to spread the virus inside the house. FYI, neither one of us had chicken pox our entire lives. NOT ONE. Well, now it turned out to be my not-so little brother who introduced us to it. Hehehe.. but yeah, please pray for his speedy recovery. It's not easy seeing him with pox all over his face. Nakakaawa eh. Pero sana lang talga, walang mahawaan samin. Haaay.<br /><br />Anyway,<br /><br />As you can see.. I've had my haircut last week and I'm so inlove with it. Haha. Everyone's in-love with it. Bwahah. :P I've been receiving very positive comments&nbsp;on how I looked now and I loved it. Bwahaha. Minsan lang kasi ako mabigyan ng praises na ganun kasi most of the time, barubal ako. :P One of my friend even told me nagdadalaga na daw ako. Wtf?! Haha. Oh well, I&nbsp; still took it as a compliment. Hehehe.<br /><br />I've been dealing with a lot lately. Life, love.. but&nbsp;mostly about school works. I've been on my most panic mode last week about my Webpage homework. It's not easy meeting up with the client everyday but I guess I just have to get used to it cos eventually, I'd be in the real world and I'd be dealing with a lot more PRESSURE than this.&nbsp;This is nothing compared to what&nbsp;I'd be dealing with in the near future. Sigh.&nbsp;I'm just glad that I'm accomplishing everything well naman. :) I just wish I pass Webpage under Ms. Cha cos I know a lot of my batchmates fail under her.

WAG NA FAUS.&nbsp;<br /><br />waaaaw. is dis lab?! Hihihi. yak ha Anna.<br /><br />Oh well, can't wait till Thursday to see him again. :) yiiihhh inlab si gaga-anna! :P<br /><br /></p>

I had goosebumps crawling up my spine the minute the jeepney I was riding at drove by the Munisipyo ng Makati. Sobrang MEMORIES man. Childhood memories. :( I mean, yeah.. we often drive by that place but it's different when you drop at Reposo, walk right across the tricycle station and take the trike you used to ride 8 years ago. Garabeh. I felt like I was 12 years old again. and yeah, My Store was still there!! Heaven yun para sakin nung bata pa ko!!! *tears of joy* hahah.<br /><br />I met up with Ms. Ellaine of Residence Inn at The Yupangco Building that afternoon. That was the reason I got ""pad-pad"" to Makati. (kamusta naman yun..<em>&nbsp;I got padpad</em>. yuck so arte!!) Ms. Ellaine was my dad's friend that was the reason I got referred to her immediately. We discussed about the site I'll be making for Residence Inn. I also got to meet their Graphic Artist. (forgive me cos I forgot her name, I was just to overwhelmed haha) It was my first time to inhale the ""office scene"" and boy was it different! I was in the REAL WORLD that whole 30 minutes Ms. Ellaine and I went up the office after eating at Dencio's, Jupiter. Ibang klaseng THRILL yun!&nbsp;Haha!&nbsp;It was different cos I was out of my parent's parameter. HAHAHA. I was there and I got there ON MY OWN and with MY OWN REASONS. :)&nbsp;Ang saya saya lang cos I felt soo indie!&nbsp;Hahaha! :)&nbsp;Garabe. I'm just so excited to do the site na. bwahahha! </p>
<p>I felt so accomplished that day. Would you imagine, I never took the cab to and from Makati? It was so easy to commute from there. HAHA! I thought I'd be lost there forever but heck no, it was CHICKEN. :P<br /><br />Saya sobra. Sorry.. Perstaym eh! hahahha<br /><br />Thursday<br /><br />I arrived late for Digilus hoping that my professor hasn't checked the attendance yet but MAAAN he skipped class that day! BADTRIP. Sana di na lang ako pumasok! hmpf.<br /><br />I was uberly happy last Thursday. Cos I was greeted by someone who's so DEAR to me.

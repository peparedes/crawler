"event","In 48 hours I will be on my way to Florida, for the awesomest trip of the year.  Going with Kevin, Jon, and RA Danny, Ice couldn't go because he interns for ABC and Walt Disney has him by the balls, fuck that guy.  But yea, Florida, it's gonna rock, except we don't know what we're gonna do down there yet, maybe Busch Gardens because we can get discounts.  Disney World is too expensive, like I said, fuck Walt.  A trip to Boca Raton to see Jon's grandparents is in order, and maybe a short drive down to Miami from there.  See everyone in a week, i'll take some pictures."

"event","Went to D.C. yesterday with Zach and his grandma.  It was great.  I saw more things than I have ever seen on any previous trip.  Saw the new World War II memorial, it is beautiful.  Then Zach and I walked over to Also saw the Lincoln Memorial, again, and walked through the West End of the National Gallery of Art.  Then Zach and I walked to the International Spy museum while Zach's g-ma waited at the National Archives, the Spy Museum was sold out for the next hour so we didn't get to go in there, disappointing.  Then we walked over to the White House and saw it from both sides, CNN was there for Georgey's talk about Iran.  Then Zach and I walked back over to the National Archives and saw the Declaration of Independence which was really faded... the only recognizable name was Hancock's because it's so fucking big.  Saw the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as well.  Then we walked over to the American Museum of Natural History and saw a T-Rex and the Hope Diamond.  Then we left."

"event","I've just finished reading my first book since, I believe... ""The DaVinci Code.""  I finished Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk, it was good, but not as horrifying as I expected.  I'm in the middle of a Jim Morrison biography which I intend to finish next, I've been reading that off and on since last September.  I also need to finish ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for the fifth time.  Recommend me some books that I can start reading while finishing the others, I know you people read, so gimme some suggestions."

Which art in barrels, 
Hallowed be thy drink, 
Thy will be drunk, 
(I will be drunk), 
At home as I am in the tavern. 
Give us this day our foamy head, 
And forgive us our spillages, 
As we forgive those who spill against us, 
and lead us not to incarceration, 
But deliver us from hangovers, 
For thine is the beer, 
The bitter and the lager, 
Forever and ever,

"event","Another sleepless night for me
Alone upon our bed
I see again his every move
And those last words he said

So proud he looked in uniform
Convinced that he was right
He had to go, for duty called
There was a war to fight.

Those last few days before he left
I hid the pain inside
We talked and loved and even joked
He never knew I cried.

And when the dreaded moment came
He kissed me tenderly
His eyes met mine, and then he said,
""I'll be alright, you'll see.""

I tried to smile and nod my head
Afraid to let him see
The terror that I feared if he
Did not come back to me.

His precious children hugged his neck
He told them to be good
And help their mommy out at home
And mind her like they should.

They were too young to realize
That Dad would not be there
To tuck them in their beds at night
Or listen to their prayers.

I see him as he walked away
I tried to say ""good-bye""
But words were trapped within my throat
All I could do was cry.

The weeks have stretched now into months
And every night I pray
That God will keep him in his care
And bring him home one day.

I do not moan beneath the load
Of all that I must do
My children will see strength in me
Until this war is through.

At last I drift off into sleep
In dreams I see him more
I turn around and smile to hear
His footsteps at the door.

Restless I sleep, and then I wake
Not opening my eyes
I move my hand to reach for him
But no one near me lies.

I will not give in to despair
With each new day I'll cope
For I know he would want me to
Be brave and live with hope.

I hear the voices loud and strong
Who criticize the war
While yelling men are fools to go
They stay on freedom's shore.

A man who cowers under fear
Will die a thousand deaths
While men like mine for freedom fight
And offer their last breaths.

I hope perhaps in fifty years
When men remember war
They won't forget the wives who dreamed
Of footsteps at the door.

"event","Dear John, 
I can't do this anymore. It hurts too much. I went out last night with our friends and your best friend told me I should leave you. He told me what you had said. I wish I would've known...sooner. You said you'd always be honest with me, but yet I wait in a shadow of lies. I don't know what to do? I don't want to give up on you yet I know i should. But it hurts still...I don't know why but it does. To hear what your best friend told me at a party with lots of people there. I tried not to cry, I tried to be strong, but I couldn't. I cried, I cried for the moments we had together hoping that I'll never forget the John I knew. I cried for plans we have made once you get home from the army, I cried for all we'll never have. But when i was done I cried for myself.I'm sorry you feel the way you do I just wish I could've found it out from you.....I""m gonna leave you with a quote because it's all I have left for us...""No man is worth your tears and the one who is would never make you cry."" anonymous."

"event","Last night I went shopping at the almighty Walmart! I figured my cat had been good the past few days so while I was there I decided to pick her up some treats and toys. So walking along the aisle I pick out some catfood in a can (her favorite). Then I decide that I'll get her a catnip mouse toy, I thought maybe she'd like it. Then low and behold I found the best gift for her, well and me for my amusement lol. I found her a kitty shirt. (Well its for small dogs but I figured hey wtf it'll fit her.) The shirt said ""It's 10 p.m. Do you know where my Master is?"" Which fit perfectly b/c I'm usually not home till after 11:00 pm. So anyways I get home and put the shirt on her, it was adorable and she didnt even try to take it off, coolness. So I fed her her canned food and then when she was done I gave her the catnip mouse toy. I saw her batting it around the couches and figured she was happy for now so I would clean the house. While I was in the kitchen cleaning up the cat comes flying off from behind the couch her paw stuck up in the air freaking out. She had gotten some sort of glue trap stuck on her paw. So I pick her up and got it off. Poor thing she was scared lol.*( No animals were hurt while removing the glue trap)* lmao!!"

Hold you close to me, 
Feel your breath upon my neck,
Your caress on my inner thigh,
Why can't I touch your lips,
while you pull me close to you,
Feel your heart beating as mine does too.
Why cant I for one minute,
remember what its like to be touched,
to be loved.
Why can't I get you out of my mind,
For in reality you'll only be in my dreams.
Why does the forbidden seems so right."

"event","Today is just another day, Harder than the rest yet I'm still alive. I had waited for a phone call or even an email, well I got what I wanted only  i didn't like what it said. But what can I do? nothing. I've waited nearly eight months , faithfully, and what do I get, I end up getting hurt...as usual. I almost wonder if I bring it on myself, but I don't know. I don't think i did anything wrong. But who's to say. I wish i could go back and not get myself in to deep like i have, I wish i would've held back the feelings I have and told myself it was dumb or too soon, but i can't turn back time, and well I guess you live and learn, only this time it seems to hurt more. Is it b/c I thought he was some how different than the rest or did I just hold him up too high, or maybe I was blind. i don't know but i hope it will get better and i hope there is a happy ending to it all, but then again this is my life we are talking about and its not always peaches and cream...oh well maybe in my next life."

"event","Why is it that everyone that tells you they'll be there for you when you need them never truly is there? In one of your worst moments and downfalls the phone rings continuosly and no one ever seems to pick up.
Last night I drove home extremely intoxicated. Which is something I don't do, but there were multiple reasons why I did.I tried to call the friends that said they'd ""be there"" for me and those that I thought would be anyways...but no one answered. Just my luck. So there I was driving, tears streaming down my face, contemplating something so horrible but at that time seemed so conveinient for me. As I continued driving I felt the urge to just jerk the wheel quickly to right slamming into a pole or even a tree, but I know how dumb it would have been so I kept driving, tears coming down my face consoling myself because no one else would...."

"event","Today is the day. This is gonna be the best day of my life. I have the perfect wedding dress. The flowers are beautiful and everything has gone as planned. My family has flown in from all over. My Grandma even made it today, she recently has been released from the hospital and is feeling young again.My soon to be husband is looking better than ever today. He is the greatest guy I could ever imagine. We met at Harvard when I was a Freshman in college. Two of our mutual friends set us up on a dream date. A date I""ll never forget full of laughs and flirts and champagne, I knew that day he was the ""one"".
  As I hurry to finish getting ready I look at myself in the mirror one more time, I'm ready.I look beautiful today, I am ready to devote my life to the man I love. As I pick up my bouquoet I hear a knock on the door. ""Who is it?"" I can hear my father on the other side. ""Are you ready its time."" I reply excitedly, ""Yes I am, I hope your ready to give me away."" I open the door and slip my arm around his. He looks at me as if he could cry but I know it would only be happy tears. The music starts up and everyone has risen out of their seats. My heart begins race with excitement. My father looks at me one more time as we begin to walk down the aisle. With each step the excitement grows. finally we reach the end the preacher asks who will give me away he replies confidently, ""I Do."" he then steps aside.
 My soon to be husband steps in front of me his eyes tearful, his hands shaking, he looks at me then speaks. ""Elizabeth I love you to death, you know that, I would do anything for you. You have been my life for so long now and I don't know what I'd ever do without you,But I can't do this."" tears begin to run down my face in disbelief. My lip trembling I begin to to speak,""Why, did I do something wrong?"" He grabs my hand and holds it tight.""Elizabeth...I'm gay."""

"event","I walk into the house and I see my Mother talking hysterically on the phone. I say hello but she does not acknowledge me. I wonder who she could be talking to. I walk over to her and once again try to get her attention and ask her whats wrong but still no answer. i listen carefully and I can hear my friend on the other end speaking in the same manner as if something terrible has happened. I see my mom crying and try to comfort her yet I cannot reach out to touch her. She asks my  friend if the ambulance has arrived and I hear my friend reply,""Yes but she is not responding and they are doing all they can, meet us at the hospital.""
 My mom hangs up the phone and grabs her keys off the table I try talk to her once again but still no reply.I get to the hospital not knowing how I got there I seemed to have blocked the trip there out. Everyone is running around frantically and crying.My friend looks over at my mom and grabs her hand and clenches it tight.In a soft shakey voice she says, ""They say they don't think she felt any pain."" My moms head falls in her hands as she tries to keep herself together but she can't. She falls down on her knees and sobs, long drawn out crys. I go over to her to comfort her once again not knowing who lies dead in the next room. I try to hug but I can't, I try again to talk to her and tell her it'll be okay and that I'll help her through everything, but once again...nothing.
  I walk into the next room curious of who lies there lifeless, I must know them. I pull myself together as I push open the door. I see doctors and nurses rushing around. I push myself forward to see whos on the bed, the nurses scatter around trying to clean everything up.I walk to the side of the bed and lift the sheet.It's me!! I fall lifeless to ground, unable to speak and move. It can't be...this can't happen to me. Why can't I remember the events leading up to this?!?
 I pull myself together enough to get up and walk into the other room. I see them standing there, my mom, my friends and the doctor. I try to speak to them to tell them I'm here and that I wont' leave them. Nothing helps I run into the bathroom desperately trying to think of something to let them know I""m here. I turn the water on trying to fog up the mirror to write them a message, but its not working, nothing is.
I scream, I scream for the life thats been stolen from me. I scream for the life I'll never have. I scream for the pain and tears that my family and friends have to now endure..I just scream.
  Suddenly I awake, my heart racing as if it could beat out of my chest, I am drenched in sweat.I take a minute to awaken to reality.It was just a dream..a horrible dream."

"event","As I walk on the sidewalk down the street I see the usual afternoon hussel and bussel.The ""lunch time crowd"", everyone with an agenda. Quirky busniess women with their breifcases and cell phones attached to there ears almost as if they're permanent fixtures to their brains. The cocky New York lawyer strutting his stuff after he helped yet another criminal go not guilty for the crimes he has commited against his family.I pass the usual ""shopping crowd"" moving slightly out of there way as they laugh and giggle at their new thousand dollar purchases being ever so carefull not to spill their lattes on their designer clothing.I take a look down at my clothing, each item seems to have been worn and washed multiple times showing its age. The green dragon of jealousy creeps up upon me as I ever so wish I could indulge in a lifestyle so high price, full of tennis lessons and yaht clubs.
I keep walking down the street passing each indiviual carefully trying not to bump into them on this ever so crowded sidewalk.I feel as if I'm the little kid in the classroom being pussed aroung by the bigger guys. Getting stomped on and trampled by the corporate world seems to be the only lifestyle that I have come to know. Each day seems to be another hassle to get to work and pay the bills. Every cab I try to flag down seems to be taken by more well to do people with their snooty glances and their noses stuck so far up in the air they can probably smell the Pasta sauce in little Italy. As I walk along I almost wonder if the cab driver gets tipped well by these sort of passsengers whose pockets change is a roll of $100 dollar bills. More than likely these snoots have complained to the driver that the ride was to ""bumpy"" and the car reaked of old socks and vomit, resulting in an unhappy customer who doesnt tip.I'm glad i'm not a cab driver.
I come to wonder everyday as I pass these individuals what their lives may actually be like. Are they really happy? Does your success actually result in a happy life? As I see so many angry faces rushing along I tend to wonder why they seem so angry. They seem to have the American dream. A perfect successful job, more than likely a happy marriage at home with two wonderful kids who have made it on the honor roll every year. A son with a college degree who will be taking over his fathers company later in life and A beautiful daughter who is set to wed the Mayors son next year.I wonder what it would be like to be them.
I continue on my walking my feet aching with each step. My shoes so worn by time and distance traveled that they seem to tell a story of hardship. My heels burning with the pain from my blisters which seem to never heal.But I keep walking pushing my self farther and harder as i go along. I sometimes wish I would've pushed my self farther and harder in life.I wish I would've listened to my parents when they told me to finish college but I never listen. I never listen to anyone except the voice in my head. It seems to know what i need.
I take a quick left turn down the alley. It's covered in trash and cardboard boxes.A man reaches out to me and tells me Robby is inside waiting for me. The old man reaks of urine and feces but he knows me, I acknowledge him and walk into the the side door of the rundown apartment complex.I can hear screaming, random cuss words and sullen crys. I know how they feel.As I walk up the stairs I see the rats scattering about, some even fighting over a spoiled package of hotdogs. This place reaks, its reaks of dead waste, it reaks like the old man outside and worst of all it reaks of failure.The walls are covered in graffiti and what looks like blood, the stairs are falling apart and the doors on the apartments hang off there hinges. As I walk into Robby's place I begin to cringe, he knows what I want, why i'm here, but i still owe him.He says hi and asks where I've been I lie and say I've been busy with my parents getting a job and fixing whats left of my life. I ask Robby if I can pay him for last time and owe him for this time, he says yes. I pull out a crumpled fifty dollar bill from my coat pocket, with my hands shaking tremendously I hand it to Robby. He reaches inside his pocket smiling, he tells me prices have gone up and that I owe him twice as much next time. I agree, but Robby knows I cant afford it. I take my purchase with a grin and place it in my pocket. Robby motions over to me and tells me that I can go to the ""black room"" in the apartment next door. I nod and head out. As I walk into the next room my urges for my drug have taken over, I must use, I must use it NOW!! I creep into the next apartment quietly trying not to disturb the other users in the room. I recieve no acknowledgements from any of them. We all know each other and we all know why we're here and thats it. The room has a pungent oder of vomit and sex. A women lies half naked on the ground next to closet, while another man pulls up his pants and smiles and walks away. I know her she comes here alot. She sells herself to suffice her habit. She wont be getting up for a while now the drug has her.
I walk over to my corner and sit on some newspapers. I pull out my drug of choice and lay it in front of me. I roll up my sleeve and pull out my rope or my ""tie off"". I wrap it so tight around my arm my fingers begin to tingle. My heart starts to race with anticipation, I need it, I must have it, its my only escape. I pick the syrigne off the ground and I tap my veins.There are hints of my previous track marks, recent history i vaugley remember. As I inject the needle in my arm I feel it, freedom. Freedom from my cares,from the world, from my parents, society, and my failure as a human being.
The poison runs deep into my veins taking over my entire body, it feels great.My heart races as if i'm about to go over a waterfall. I start to sweat profusely. My head starts to hurt, my body jerking violently, somethings wrong, Oh My God somethings wrong!! I start to lose control of my bodily functions ands begin urinating on myself as i slip back and forth in to reality then to a horrible nightmare. I see Robby enter the room. I try to scream for him to help me but I seem to be paralyzed momentarialy. He comes towards, I feel as if he's come to save me.He leans down to my ear and says, ""Thats what you get you little fuck, you're gonna set a great example for all those who don't pay up."" He stands up and kicks me in the ribs thens spits on me. I can feel him dragging me out of the apartment down the stairs, my body lifeless yet I know whats going on but I can't do anything.Robby pulls me outside and props me by the dumpster.He leans down and whispers in my ear, ""Goodnight and goodbye."" and walks away.
This is it I know it is, I can feel it. The voice has died, it finally got what it wanted,poison. I drift off as I say goodbye to my family, I know they're not here but I still continue on.I say goodbye to my friends new and old. My college buddies and my fraternity sisters, and those who started me on this lifestyle, I say goodbye. I tell my parents I'm sorry for all I've done, I tell them that they were right, it was the ""wrong crowd"". I begin to pray, I pray for all I've done and didn't do, I ask to be forgiven, I say I'm sorry for not going to church with my parents every sunday because I was to busy getting my fix. I pray for my soul, I pray for him to take me away form this life...forever. I close my eyes and I let go....

To be continued....

"event","For some tomorrow may never come
Today may never fade
The past may be a lesson
That some of us have made.

Everyday has a different meaning
A memory made to last.
Another day without an ending
A kiss you hope will last.

A call from an old friend
Just wanting to say hi
A chance to make things right,
Or a time to say goodbye.

In this world you need to love,
There is no room for hate.
Tell that one person how you feel,
Because tomorrow may be too late.

For some tomorrow may never come
So tell them what they mean
For you tomorrow may only be another day
For some it may never be seen.

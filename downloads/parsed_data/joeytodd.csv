"event","<em>This is such generic poetry.&nbsp; In no way am i trying to sound hardcore or emo or anything that the scene obides by its just writing. I wish i could write better but whatever.&nbsp; All the events and things in this poem are real-life and have hapened.&nbsp; It may be a track on the newest and last M'aidez cd so check it out.<br /></em><br />If songs of you were stories<br />from pens that have black or blue to bleed<br />pages would turn to see whats writen of me.<br />And id have a library of useless literature<br />like photography books with no&nbsp;pictures.<br />Id have to tell about you and i with imagery mixtures<br />and words for me that are so imature.&nbsp; Too imature.<br />In the brightest light of your lifetime<br />im&nbsp;blind.<br />you were so kind and it always makes me wonder why<br />sooner this kindness i coulndt find.<br />And even now im still looking to kill<br />so my own needs get filled, and home gets built<br />my face is my fathers and so it is scared<br />so i stuff down another pill.<br />to get my very own acceptancy fill.<br />and still,<br />i drink the deadly night shade<br />so my heart wont complain<br />and to make certain memories fade<br />its forbade, what happened that evening<br />were so sore from beleiving how wrong it was.<br />for you and i to be ""Us""<br />Forgeting is a MUST<br />it wasnt us it was drunken lust<br />I wipe the dust from my brain<br />and pour those memories down the drain."

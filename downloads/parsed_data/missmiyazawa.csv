soy icecream/soy chocolate milk is yummy.
i have nothing much to say. im sleepy. and not depressed, not sad, not anything really. i want to leave and never see anyone again. cause its as good as its going to get and i'm scared that one of these days someones gonna freak and i' ll be left with no one. 
i dont deserve most of the friends i have now, they are so good to me.
I feel like i am mouching off them.
I wonder if i become very draining sometimes?

"event","I dont think i am ever quite happy with anything, this journal could prove that very well. My friends list is so short, is it because no one has the time to add me or they dont want to  put up with my self deprecating crap anymore? I vote for the latter. eh well ive learned  valuable lessons: 1. friends are valuable 2. Dont  Alienate the situations 3. No one likes an attention getter.
Well im done dweling on things. 4 seems like to big of a number these days."

I want to hug and dance and laugh like usual, not be plasticine and brittle. Im not real sure what went down i know that it did and i watched from a distance, and life exploded and i opened my sad little journal to write it all down. 
Sticky like elmers glue i'll never get to say all the things i wanted to.
Your not in the way, your not part of the problem, i love you, you and you.  I cant help but bring my problems to school separting my emotions is hard. Melodramatic, overdone, burnt. 
I realise it but do nothing about it. 
Your Honesty is delightful. THank you. Only a true friend would tell the truth."

"event","Thing i'd like to ask out loud and not sound retarted:

Is it me?
Did i do something wrong?
How can i fix it (me)?
Is there anyway i can keep this friendship from turning to shit?

Id like to be able to have this conversation out loud without anyone around, yet it seems to be that thats not possible there is always someone around.

Never the less  even they  do hate me or if ive become fake i'll always be there to lend them a hand or make them smile.

I feel like celophane, clear and see-through, but still no one understands me. 

I sure wish people would talk to  me more, i like letters too. i think what i need to do is not stay up all night trying to figure out ways fix myself. Am i really broken? Or just fractured? What i need is things to go back they way they were, what changed over these past weeks to turn everthing grey?

Mmm...i wish the best for everyone, and incase i happen to die, i love you all."

"event","It's sad i even have time to write in this silly thing before school. I was going to write something else, not what im going to end up writing. I just hope the people who read this journal of mine dont end up disliking me for my inane thoughts, that dont consume my whole being. 

I've noticed i get more and more discusted with myself the more people touch me, my mother for instance, i cant even let her hug me because it makes me want to vomit, not because of her becuse of me. Barrianne tried tickling me and i freaked. I think i might have some serious problems, but i keep avoiding that fact and try to live normally and not see the friendships around me dwendling. Heh, i think ive already gone over the friendship thing, but i dont think anyone knows how much i care about them, in friendships i try to be selfless, but i guess thats not how they work, hence the problem of me only being able to keep four friends at one time. 

torn in the middle by ravenous dogs, let them take me for all i care, it  can still get worse."

"event","When i dont know the full side of things i turn very pessimistic and assume the problem (s) is me. Usually it is. 

I've been trying to give people, my friends, their space. But in doing so i just pushed them away and ended up being what people think i am, a flake, a hollowed out jack-o-lantern of myself. When i am not those things. 

I feel so much that it begins to hurt to think, i put so much emotion in to little reactions that, that, it feels as if my heart, head, and soul will explode. 

I cant tell if people want be around anymore so i just make the decision for them and cut them off, and blame them for my hurt when i've done it to myself.

I say things, hurtful things, i dont mean and cant help myself. Its the bitter part of me that wants to sabbotoge any good friendship i have.

I started out good and look what ive done, i feel like crap again. Fill me in guys if you dont like me tell me why and i might beable to fix me, if i dont know why you dislike me how can i get better?"

"event","as i pull away from one friend and cling another my head expands with forgotten memories, memories i try to conceal, that hurt me to much to relive them anymore. I see myself becoming something thats worn off, my flavor has faded and i'm being tossed aside for something fresher. As i listen to my sisters voice i think of the pain in it, hoping someday it will heal. Hoping someday i have someone to be pained for. 

School was uneventful today, people talk about the joy of leaving when all i know about is there, i dont want to leave what makes me happiest. I've stopped saying i love you to much, it just seems to get lost in the intricate pattern of woven lies. And when i do it is often misunderstood. I feel hopeless, like the sadness and happiness is colliding within me to create some mystical beast that eats slowly at my heart. I hate to say it but i think ive become a bit of a bitch.

"event","My weekend was one of the longest and most enjoyable ive had in a long time. Only because i made it so. You only get outta life what you put into it. I dont put much and its hard putting in anything at all. But this weekend i was all alone and enjoyed it quite a bit. My father said things that hurt but i just looked at him and realised he just wants to protect me and his way of doing that, as hurtful as it is, is just the way he does things. I made niki something and it'll make her happy, shes the only person i can really make happy, and not have to wear myself out doing it. 

Im really truly lucky, i have things no one will ever have, and things i dont have i will gain in time.

Meh, my mom has noticed my unhappiness and rather mellow moods. I cant explain to her how i feel that people have maybe given up on me, or dont trust me. In in plain english, that fucking makes me want to melt in to the carpet  and be what i have become, a stain on the lives of many.  My hands are cold my mouth dry my brain full of crazy thoughts and conversations to come. My father knows just what i hate and he does it anyway, its the little things i notice, i tend to miss the big picture, that everything will end up good, but at the moment i could care less what i leave behind if i were to die right now. Death is a huge part of me, life is not much. I keep waiting for my time and get dissapointed it isnt sooner. But as long as things make me shallowly happy for awhile im good. Just dont let me get so down i take a gamble that my parents wont find me soon enough to pump my stomach. These are the things i am thinking if im alone to long, you should have seen my mind last summer. this is why i cant write to much, or at all, gets me thinking about the consequenses of my death, if i were to play god. And why i cant be normal have a have a relationship. Sex makes me sick. Love is never going to be something i have. I cant relate to many, i can listen im really good at that. If i told everyone what i was acctually thinking, im sure the three friends i have would dissapear. Im loud to drown out the voices in my head. I worry about others because i hope to god they are nothing like me, and if they are i try to help, and i end up making things worse. Melodramatic, no, this is actually what i am like in my head. Told you no one wanted to know all about me, people would rather ignore the elephant in the living room and pretend its not there. Im happy, im fine. More lies to stoke the fire."

"event","today was a-okay. everything was pretty much good.

If friendships could be described id say its like a big ocean and today there were some ripples but no tsunami's.

I noticed today that ive never been real with anybody. I'm not fake i just never show anybody anything more then the surface, the sunny happy me, never the girl who gets home and yells at her mom for being deaf and gets frusterated and breaks down and cries with no one to understand her and comfort her.

I think after the first failed friendship i just decided to give up that people truly arent worth the agony i suffer to keep a friend. It shouldnt be this hard i told myself that if friends would try a bit more, but i guess none of my previous friends ever thought i was worth keeping. And when my friends stay for 6 months or longer, i dont want to ruin the friendship, so i dont show anymore of myself because i think they wouldn't like the rest of me.

i dont like when  people are quiet cause to me it means there is something wrong, that i have done you harm. When my mom gets mad shes quiet, and its usually because of me.

there is so much to me that it all gets jumbled together, when i studder and cant speak, its because my mind is racing so fast that im thinking so many things good and bad they clash together, i suspect thats where my migrains come from.

I see art in everything.
I see beauty in all women.
I see pain in loving people's eyes.
I see failing friendships i cant save.
I see things that won't last after i leave."

Like nothing matters to no one only yourself?

That everyone is so enveloped in there own stuff to notice the little things anymore?

That pain has become the only constant in a lot of kids Lives?

That being sad has become a fad?

That saying ""iloveyou"" is never taken seriously?

That when you die, you lived your life in vain?

That your best friends find you slightly annoying and tend to point out your worse qualities?

That everyday someone else breaks my heart alitte more?

"event","so i read some government junk, polotics is acctually quite interesting if i only could understand it a bit more. School Was school, and i attempted to avoid someone in the morning cause i felt i let her down some how. But i realised i let myself down more. Art was art, odd moments when i wasnt quite sure what was going on, then after it was over i was told the problem and knew it was totally an ok reason to be weird. Ive pulled away some from certain people, i feel no matter what i will eventually become a burden its bound to happen so ive decided this time i wont let it and i will stop it by not letting myself become a proverbial octopus that attaches herself with all eight tenticals sucking the life outta all her friends. I think i'd love to become an artist, when i get really effing sad the only thing that makes me happy is to draw. Brittany is a very Beautiful and always ends up being a source of inspiration for me. I have to start my first art project and i think i will do a simple face done in acrylics. I keep finding myself jealous of people that make friendships seem so easy, and i make myself a third wheel because i end up detaching myself so well, a little to well, that i just sorta hang back and become the backdrop for the rest of the world. I accept my demise and hope to over come it, and i will look back at this entry and think about deleting it."

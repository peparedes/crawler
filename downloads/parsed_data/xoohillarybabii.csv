"event","its hard to believe today started out so boring and ended up being fricken hilarious! 

so this morning me and alex were just kinda sitting around. we werent really doing anything. i kept calling ali to see if she wanted to come over or do something but she wasnt answering her damn phone. so alex comes in and asks if i wanna go to the mall. i said yes of course. 

so we drive over there and we listen to the beauty and the beast soundtrack. lmao! how hot is that? i love alex. definite comical relief. so we lunched at johnny rockets. not so great today. and then we headed over to the mall after that. 

so me and alex were walking around and im still trying to get a hold of ali cause it is very unlike her to not answer her cell phone. so alex taps me and tells me to look to the left. i look to the left and guess who it is? its ali! so alex went off to get starbucks gift cards and let me and ali just do our own thing.

so we were sitting on one of the benches like counting money or something and i guess alex called ali to see about my present. so she had to get up and walk a few feet over. and im like looking around and i see carrie walking in our direction. so i stop her and tell her to look around with us and she agrees. 

after ali got off the phone we walked over to victorias secret so i could get some love spell for lindsey. and we are like trying out all these testers and in walks franchesca. so i go over to her and i tell her that my sister is walking around somewhere and so she goes off to look for her. so then the three of us go into charlotte russe and ali like nudges me and is like.. isnt that one of your sisters friends? so i look over and nina is over on the far wall. and then i look over on the other side and jessica is like looking at one of the racks. so im just like omg! and then denise was walking around the store too. so i called alex and was like... all your friends are over here. 

so we all went over and talked to jessica for a few minutes until alex came and then we went to leave. and as we are leaving kaya walks in. can you believe that? like everyone was in the same place at the same time but it wasnt planned. lol i think thats like really cool.

so thats really all the cool things that happened today. i know im easily amused"

"event","i know i havent updated in forever. i am honestly trying as best as i can!

so friday night me and libby spent the night with candace. it was so much fun! we played charades and it was so retarded. so i went to pick one of the cards when it was my turn and i got marshmallow. so i just like sat there in a little bundle and pretended i was roasting myself. lmao! the funniest thing was when libby got donkey and she starts like pointing to her ass. and me and candace are like wtf? 

then we had pizza. libby got the pizza award! seven pieces! holy moly! lol what a cow. im just kidding. i love libby! we were actually pretty calm until after her parents went to sleep and libby opened the fridge and saw that there was red bull in there. lol so we drank every single can and ate brownies and ice cream and pretty much any junk food that we could get our hands on.

by that time we were bouncing off the walls pretty much. so we ran all the way down to the park. lol we were screaming the whole way. when we got to the park we played grounders. well we played it as best as we could with three people lol. libby ran into the pole like head on! and me and candace just stood there and laughed. we are horrible friends lol. 

then we went back to her house and drank soda and ate chips while we watched the grudge. then we put like war paint on our faces. i dont really know why. i guess we just felt like it. and then we tackled each other for about ten minutes and got bored with that.

so we washed it off and made pancakes. then we decided that we were too tired to eat them so we trashed them and fell asleep. i only got like an hour in before me and libby got picked up.

i went home and slept before me and alex went to christmas in the park. jessica and logan were so cute on their song! and i got to see jenna! and of course ali was there lol. so then after it was done alex drove me and alex over to mikas house for her birthday party.

it was really fun! like i seriously wished it had lasted forever. it was a really good group. by the time we got there everyone was already doing cake and presents and stuff. so we each had one piece of cake and then we moved onto presents.

ali got her a gift card to hollister and a beenie buddy. aww! it was so cute! i wanted to steal it lol. and then she got the sisterhood of the traveling pants on dvd. and vanna got her season two of the oc on dvd. cam gave her money. lol you can never go wrong with that. liv got her a picture frame and a journal that came with a really cute fuzzy pen. libby gave her a gift card to music world and roadkill slippers. those things rock! i was so jealous! and then i gave her a sweater from american eagle. 

we went outside and played sardines for a bit. vans and cam clearly dont get the concept of individually lol. then we came back inside and watched the pants movie. then i fell asleep cause i was so tired from the night before.

the weekend was great! i had fun!"

"event","im so sorry that i havent updated in like weeks! soccer just ended so you would think i would have more time to write. but that is very wrong lol. i auditioned for the tennis team just to see if i could make it or not. i wasnt really expecting to get a spot because there were tons of girls there trying out for it. i ended up making varsity! i was so shocked! im the only freshman on the team too. so i have practice for that everyday now. my mom also limited my computer time down to two hours a day because she still wants my grades to get better. but jessica yelled at me today for not updating in such a long time. so im gonna do that now.

i got my schedule changed. i am no longer in chorus anymore. its so weird not seeing ali for a period. and i miss having a class with jessica too. i never see her anymore. so i have study hall first period now and history third. it works out good though cause now i can do my homework in study hall and not worry about it. 

school today was just a blur. like i dont even remember any of my classes. after school i had tennis and then i went over to the chorus room cause i was trying to find ali. some kids were sitting in there eating popcorn and watching friends. lol but she wasnt in there so i left. i figured out later that she was out by the stadium practicing for competition cheerleading. i was a little slow today lol.

so then after school alex and i went to walmart and i got carries album! ali had asked me to get hers too. so i got her copy too. it is so good! im in love with it! so then alex dropped me back off at school. 

i hung out with antonio for a little while after that. then i saw shelby come out of the chorus room so i went back in there. ali was in there this time lol. i guess they were all like really happy to see me or something. cause they all were like.. group hug! 

so they said i could sit and watch their practice. they are singing this song and they are supposed to look all hot and everything. and they had to keep stopping because ali was being too innocent lol. it was cute. she was all blushing. she finally got it down. jessica had to work with her a little bit lol. it was so funny cause when she got it mr. lay was like... alison can be seductive! lol we knew she had it in her.

that was pretty much my day today. well all i remember of it lol. i will update again as soon as i can!"

"event","today was just super duper bunches of fun! i loved it! classes were cut seriously short cause of the pep rally. so we pretty much hung out and did nothing all day. woot!

so rode to school with alex. she was nervous cause we are finding out who won queen tomorrow at the dance. so she was like omg! flipping out! so ali got to school late cause this bus crashed into a car and they had to go pick up the kids that were on it. so i didnt even see her until after first period.

i dont even remember what happened in the classes cause there is nothing to remember about them. hahah. so we went to sixth period for like ten minutes so the people who had last lunch didnt have to go back to their fifth period. i thought that was kinda dumb but whatever. ali didnt come with me cause the cheerleaders had to go straight to the stadium. 

the seniors were called out first to go to the stadium. and then the rest of the classes. i was one of the first people to get there. i even beat most of the seniors. omg what were they thinking putting the freshmen and seniors by eachother? what idiots! lol yeah that was not so good. 

so i sat with vanna, cam, libby, kaya, and mika. i love watching ali cheer lol. its the best! she looks so cute doing it too. so it started with jessica who sang the national anthem and did a great job! very proud of her! and then they introduced the football team and the homecoming court.

so everyone got all lined up out on the field and then we just sat and waited forever until they gave the mother effing results! they did freshmen first. libby didnt win. antonio didnt either. something is seriously wrong with our class. libby handled it very well though. so im proud of her too. then they did sophomores and juniors but nobody really cares about them. 

so everyone left the field except for the seniors. and they got ready to announce king. queen wont be announced until tomorrow at the dance. which totally sucks. so david won second runner up. jarrod won first runner up. junior won king! omg he is so hott! and he was walking with alex so when they announced that he won he like picked her up and was spinning her. it was so cute! so we will know if either jessica or alex won tomorrow. or maybe dawnyelle will win. who really knows? its gonna be really close though!

so then the sophomore class did their skit which sucked. i felt bad for them. then the cheerleaders did this dance to this mix that was so good and had like all my favorite songs! good job girls! so then the junior class did their skit which was adorable! they had like this time machine and omg it was so cute! i loved it!

so then the dance team performed. and then all the other clubs that i dont really remember too well. and then the cheerleaders did some cheers. so then the seniors did their skit. the freshmen didnt have a skit cause our class president didnt turn it in. yeah. good job james!

but the senior skit was so cute! alex is on board so she was out there. i wasnt sure if she was gonna be cause of court and everything. but it was hard to pick her out in the crowd cause every single senior at school today was wearing their senior shirt! i mean everybody! and the crowns lol. everyone looked the same. but she put on this pink hat that used to be taylors and thats how i finally saw her. haha the thriller dance! david was so funny! lol omg it was adorable!

so then they gave the spirit stick to the seniors. big surprise there. the juniors got second. we actually beat the sophomores. lol they were pissed off so bad. it was kinda funny. it was a good pep rally!

took ali home cause her bus had to take all those kids from the bus that crashed. so she rode home with us. updates tomorrow probably! so look out for those! and if you read please comment! the point for me to write all this is so you can read it. and i dont know if you are reading it or not unless you comment. so please do it!"

"event","had to get up like way early this morning cause alex had to go in early to help change some of the decorations in the senior hall i guess. i looked so ugly cause i had like no time to get ready. so i rode the bus with ali. 

went over to her house at like 6. lol the dancing on the counter. my humps! then we ate popsicles and rice krispie treats for breakfast while we watched higglytown heroes lol. omg we are so cool. haha ali is all like.. you are never too old for playhouse disney.

so then walked down to the bus stop. ben like took a fricken piss right there on the side of the road! omg that was so gross! ali is like.. that is someones yard! lol boys these days.

alex and all them were still decorating the senior hall when we got there. there was no second period today. no algebra! yes! first period and third period were just extended cause the sophomores had to take their plan test today. 

i slept the entire time through first period. like i was out cold lol. we watched some dumb video. plus i was tired from having to get up like an hour earlier than usual. so then i met up with ali after and we walked to chorus together.

omg chorus was the funniest thing. we played a whole bunch of games. and so he was like... i need five people. and he picked me, ali, tyler, and corey. so he told me to go outside and wait until he called me back in. so i waited outside for a few minutes and they let me back in. so we were supposed to be a news crew. and me and tyler were the head anchors. ali was sports and corey was weather. and each of them had some like weird characteristic about them and i was supposed to guess what it was.

so i start it off and give the introduction and tyler just starts howling like a crazy person. so im like.. ok over to sports. lol and ali was the funniest person out of this entire thing. love and basketball! lmfao! so shes giving the sports report. lol if you could call it that. and randomly she just runs over and like jumps on me. so im like.. weather! and corey just stands there with his head tilted to the side and like sticks out his tongue. so im just like wtf? and tyler is just howling and ali wont let go of me. everyone in the class was laughing. lol except for jessica and logan who ""disappeared"" behind the piano during all of this. 

lol so then i had to guess. and i guessed that tyler was a werewolf. woo! i was right! go me! i had a little trouble figuring out the other two. ali was supposed to be in love with me lol. and let me tell you she did a really good job lol. and corey was a llama that had some weird disease. lol i cant remember it now.

so he asked if anyone else wanted to do it and nobody said anything. so the four of us did another one. well we switched out tyler with adam and added patrick. so we sent patrick out this time. and this time patrick was throwing a party and we were his guests. and he had to guess our little interesting characteristic. so he got to ali and everyone was like.. make her a contestant in a beauty pageant. so he was like.. alison is auditioning for miss trailer park america. lmao! ali is like.. i got yall on the trailer trash. and i was like insane and i thought that patricks house was my house.

lol so he brings patrick back in and we are all waiting behind the piano cause its supposed to be the door. and kaya is like.. i wanna be the door knocker! lol that was funny. so he lets us in. lol ali is so good at this. she like is posing and she wraps her arm around him and he like picked her up. it was cute lol. so then she is like... everybody move out of my way! im strutting! lmao! so im like sitting on the desks with my feet all propped up and everything and then i just go crazy and start yelling at everyone. it was really fun lol. 

that was the last one we did. but there were another really funny one after logan and jessica ""appeared"" again. wink wink. lol ali is like... hey where have you two been? lmfao! so then we had english for like ten minutes. we played tic tac toe with the vocab words! our side sucked at it lol. 

so then computers was boring. at lunch i went over to where alex and everyone was sitting so i could get money. and logan had like this green doll poking out of his stomach. so i like just stared at it for a minute and then everyone just started laughing lol. it was strange.

the rest of the day was nothing special. rode home with alex. napped briefly and then took the doggies for a walk. now getting ready to watch some tv!"

the first day of spirit week! it was superhero day! omg jessica, logan, david, and alex dressed up as the fantastic four! it was so cute! lucas and nate were carebears! lmao! lucas was sharebear and nate was bedtime bear. it was so funny! very original.

i do not like the way the freshmen hall is decorated. the lights are all red and everything. everytime i walk down there it makes me think that im like walking into hell. lol alisons like.. yeah hell that has balloons and banners everywhere. that was funny lol.

libby had to miss computers cause they called the court finalists to the library so they could record their little ten second speech things. so we watched a video in computers. lol it was inspiring. omg ali goes.. i think im gonna write a book! lmao! me and katelin busted out laughing. 

libby came back at lunch. lol funny stuff. if i chug this beer will i die? haha alisons like... theres beer here? lmfao! so after school i had practice. rode home with alex. ali went home with jessica. lol same old thing. and thats pretty much it for monday.

[[ tuesday ]]


so today was retro day. let me tell you that those seniors really get into the spirit! alex went all out! so we were on assembly schedule since we had to watch the speeches. so third period was extended so we could watch them all. 

it was funny cause at first they put in the version that wasnt edited and so we got to see them all messing up. omg it was so funny! libby was so cute! shes all like.. hi im amanda. most of you probably know me as libby but um yeah amanda is my name. lol me and ali were laughing.

alex messed up too. she like coughed in the middle of her name and then started laughing. and then we looked over at jessica cause she was like omg. they cut it off before they got to hers. she was relieved lol. im gonna have to get alex to show me that tape secretly. 

lol so then me and ali headed off to english. paula abdul was playing when we walked in lol. ali was like singing. so the names for all the homecoming finalists were on the board. and ms. kelley was drawing stars next to the people she knew. so she got to the girls and was like.. dawn is cool. and then she puts down the marker. and me and ali are like.. alex and jessica are cool! lol it was like at the exact same time too. 

so then we had to vote again. voted for libby of course. and i voted for alex. i considered voting for jessica since i voted for alex last time but ali went ahead and voted for jess again so i just stuck with alex. me and ali did good though. we got half the class to vote for alex and the other half to vote for jessica. except there were two guys who just had to vote for dawnyelle cause they said she was the hottest girl there. whatever.

so for the guys ali voted for david and i voted for junior. omg he is so fricken hot! im glad that him and alex are friends lol cause i get to see him like all the time. 

alex came into my science class today. and me and ali jumped up and gave her hugs. and all these guys in my class were like.. we voted for you! do we get hugs? and she like rolled her eyes and left lol. and then ali was like.. did you really vote for her? and they all were like no.

so then after i went out to the parking lot and helped out jessica cause she was like having trouble carrying everything out to her car. and then when i ran back over to alexs car junior was there talking to her! and he gave me a hug! omg he is so hot lol. so fricken hott! and im obsessed lol.

"event","my birthdays getting closer! eek! im so fricken excited! my party is gonna be huge! 

so yesterday was just ordinary. jessica wasnt at school. so me and ali were sad about that. im pissed cause i have to pay seven freaking dollars for a library book. the books not even missing. its just cause i turned it in way late. so that sucks and it put me in a bad mood. 

we made signs for the pep rally in english. lol ms. kelley is big on school spirit. me and ali made one that said.. freshmen love the cheerleaders! and then we made a couple more but that one was the best. we all sat in the front at the pep rally. it was pretty good. ali didnt mess up once. im so proud of her lol.

so then after school rode home with alex as usual. watch some gilmore girls and 7th heaven. then my mom came in and asked if i wanted to go shopping and i said no. so now she thinks im on drugs lol. and she made alex come in and talk to me to see if i was feeling ok. 

so last night at the game for the first half the junior varsity cheered with the varsity. so ali was cheering. omg she looked so cute! she kept getting distracted by us and would start laughing. it was funny. libby finally showed up after half time. no idea what took her so long!

ali came over and sat with us after they were done cheering. then me and her walked around a little bit. ms. kelley was there and gave us the signs we had made for the pep rally. so me and ali got sharpies from alex and made signs for jordan on the back. mine was the best lol. jordan is our sexy flute player! haha. she loved it!

so then after the game me, libby, ali, katelin, and jordan all went to get ice cream. we talked about how badly we lost. so now we are 5-3. thats not that great. but oh well. next week is the homecoming game! so that is gonna be fun.

so woke up today at like 9 and ate breakfast. then watched mean girls and fell back asleep. then woke up again and showered. got dressed. gray shirt with white tank. then my jean skirt, brown belt, and brown flip flops. 

so then headed over to alisons house. omg her homecoming dress is so pretty! i am in love with it! she is gonna look so gorgeous in it! so then we headed off to the mall. i got a blue bag for school at forever 21 and underwear at gap body lol. ali got a pink long sleeve shirt, a really cute white sweatshirt thing, and a long sleeve navy polo all from hollister. and then she got a long sleeve light blue shirt from american eagle. then we headed over to to best buy and she got the sisterhood of the traveling pants. i so know im getting that for my birthday!

so then went back to her house for a little bit. watched the sisterhood of the traveling pants and then we watched twitches which wasnt that great. tia and tamera were great in it but the storyline was kinda stupid. 

i have no idea what im doing tonight. call if you wanna do something!"

"event","so today was so crazy! i rode the bus with ali this morning instead of going with alex cause she had to take some extra time to get ready. we had the homecoming assembly today and so all the nominees were supposed to bring their dresses and suits and stuff. 

riding the bus with ali was fun. had an interesting conversation with her and jordan. if i were.. lol that was funny. did that like the whole bus ride and the driver thought we were nuts. 

so get to school. libby was really nervous about the results so we all hugged her quickly before we went to the gym. it took a few minutes cause everyone had to get changed. sat in between ali and kaya. i am so in love with those chickenheads. 

so the freshmen came out first. libby looked so pretty! tried to get pictures but it was hard cause people kept standing in front of the camera. her and antonio looked so cute walking together! so then the sophomores and juniors. all the senior couples came out on a float. im not sure who was with alex. he was pretty hot though. david was with jessica. omg i have never seen jessica look so beautiful! she looked stunning! and so did jenna and alex! 

so they announced they had to eliminate two girls and guys from each grade. they did freshmen first. lol we were so nervous for libby me and ali were like holding onto eachother. libby made it! yay! so did antonio! we were all jumping. so then had to sit through sophomores and juniors which i honestly really dont care too much about. 

so then finally got to seniors! alex and jessica both made it! so we will all vote again and they will announce the freshmen, sophomore, and junior winners at the game. but we wont find out the king and queen till the dance. all the girls will get like flowers and stuff though since they are all reps.

didnt really do anything the rest of the day. me and libby made funfetti cupcakes at lunch! woo! they were good too. then we went outside and sat by the fountain and i met swampy and swampy II. lol it was pretty fricken funny. 

so then gym and science. nothing special. then met up with libby and we took that hottie home with us. we were psycho! we danced and played tennis and watched how to lose a guy in 10 days. then we did cartwheels in my front yard. and then libbys like.. look theres a car coming! he gets a free show! lmfao! i have never heard anything so funny!"

"event","ok im not gonna lie. i liked today a lot. there were a few things that could have gone better but most of the day was just fabulous.

drive to school was good. alex looked really cute today lol. she had the little school girl look going on. so we got there and she ditched me to go hang with all her senior friends. so libby comes running up to me and like grabs me and is all like.. omg we are voting for court today! lol she was like jumping around and almost knocked ali over when she came up to us. it was funny.

so then me and ali went to our lockers so we could get our books for the morning classes. and i guess the guys decided to go all laguna beach on us cause alisons locker was like completely decorated. it had these huge signs on it that were like.. will you go to homecoming with me? and then tyler was standing there with flowers and he was like... please! it was so cute!

so first period was nothing. we watched a video so i spent the whole period writing notes for kaya and camjam. omg alex totally screwed up on the show this morning. they had cut to this video and then it went back to the anchors and like her and logan were talking and they had no idea that the camera was back on them. it was so fricken hilarious!

algebra sucked big ones. chorus was fun! logan came in and me and ali were teasing him about how him and alex messed up on the show and he was like.. that was all her fault! and he was like blaming it on her. he worked with the groups again today so i spent the whole period working on jordans birthday sign which is awesome and is gonna be better than everyone else. 

so in english we voted for homecoming. lol and i was reading the slip for freshmen and forgot for a second that libbys name is actually amanda. so i tapped ali on the shoulder and i was like.. wheres libby? shes not on here. and she laughed at me and was like.. her name is right there. wow i felt stupid lol.

computers was fun. yesterday libby had an incident and broke her pinky finger. so now her arm is wrapped and everything. so i was like.. tell me what happened. and so she came up with this huge story about how she was walking by the railroad tracks and there was this kid walking with his dog. and so this kid gets his foot stuck in the track and there was a train coming. and so libby saves the day and stops the train. lmao! alisons like... with your pinky? omg it was so funny!

so then lunch. jesse came up to me and asked me if i wanted to go with him so we could get our homecoming tickets. so i got up so i could go with him cause its cheaper if you go with somebody. and he like held my hand. lol it surprised me. and just my luck alex is the one selling the tickets. so im just like niiiceee. alex gave him a small lecture before i was able to rescue him lol.

so get back to the table and sarah wanted to know what happened to libbys finger. so shes like.. i was skydiving. lol katelins like omg. so we are all like.. what really happened? and shes like.. i tripped over a tree stump. and all of us just busted out laughing. omg i love libby lol.

so then gym. me and ali were figuring out all the homecoming couples. and she finally found a dress! yay! i havent seen it yet but she described it and it sounds really pretty. i am so fricken exciting for homecoming! its gonna be the best!

so then science. ms. dykstra had to go cause she had her ultrasound today. so naturally it made me start thinking about lindsey. so this girl that i like have never talked to in my life turns to me and is like.. isnt your sister pregnant? and i was like.. how did you know that? and she just shrugged and was like... ive heard stuff. so me and ali thought that was kinda weird. 

so walked with mika out to the parking lot after school. someone like put gum on alexs car. omg she was so pissed! jessica was really nice and stayed while we tried to get it off even though it probably made her late for that class shes taking. 

got home and watched gilmore girls and 7th heaven. what do you know? the episode where lucy has her baby. omg i cant wait till lindsey has hers. like seriously. probably homecoming update later cause everyones been asking me to do one"

"event","so fall break was amazing! i had the best time. it was so good to see lindsey and jake! and omg cindy! she has gotten so big! i loved it so much!

:: wednesday ::


was on the plane like the whole day. me and alex had a good time though. im so glad the two of us had this time to talk and everything. we dont really have the chance to spend time together anymore. we slept most of the way but in the middle of the flight alex had to pee and this man that was in the bathroom was taking forever. so i was like... why dont you go and wait at the door? and then shes like.. theres a woman waiting there already. so i look back and theres no woman there. so im like.. go knock on the door. and shes like.. what if the woman went in there with him? what if they are in there having sex right now? hahah. im like.. what is this the mile high club? lmfao! that was the funniest thing ever!

:: thursday ::

 
woke up really late cause we got there so late the night before that all we could do was sleep. we didnt have time to do anything. so we talked about the baby over breakfast. lindsey thinks its another girl. which i wouldnt mind having another niece but i really want a nephew! but i will love it either way of course. so they decided that if it was a girl they were gonna name it riley or mallory. and if it was a boy they were gonna name it kyle or jeffrey. so cute! lindsey is starting to show too! how exciting is that? like seriously me and alex were freaking out.

so we dropped cindy off at monicas for the day. jake just stayed at home cause he knew the three of us wanted to bond and stuff. so we went shopping. lindsey was really generous and bought me really expensive shoes and the cutest earrings ive ever seen in my life! so the then the three of us went to buckle and i got some jeans, a belt, and a really cute shirt. then i bought this gray hooded long sleeve shirt from hollister, a white tank from gap, and a white vest from abercrombie. omg i love it so much. i have wanted it so bad forever! then i got a green shirt that has brown sparkles on it. so we had a good day of shopping lol.

:: friday ::

the three of us sat at the house and had like a movie marathon. and we talked about everything under the sun. lol i swear. so many random talks. i told her about homecoming and how im going with jesse! eek! and how he is the hottest guy that ever fricken lived! and alex is so gonna win homecoming queen! if she doesnt then i hope jessica or jenna does. 

then we went to chipotle and i had two burritos! i like seriously stuffed my face. jake had to come too so he could monitor lindseys eating lol. then talked to ali and libby on the phone for a little bit. i let ali talk to linds for a few minutes cause she wanted to congratulate her and stuff. 

spent the rest of the day hanging out with cindy cause i like never see her. gosh that girl is gonna be beautiful when she grows up! she named one of her barbies after me lol. i felt so honored. haha! alex is like.. wheres my barbie? lol i loved it!

:: saturday ::

kinda like wednesday. plane ride back to navarre. this time me and alex talked most of the way instead of sleeping. so we had to leave the house pretty early. i cried because lindsey is such a special part of my life and it sucks she has to live so far from home. it kinda got me thinking that once alex leaves its just gonna be me for the next three years. and a lot of times i say it will be better once its just me but i am really gonna miss alex so much when she leaves. and im not ashamed to admit that at all. 

so we discussed that for awhile and i started crying again lol. we had some nice sister moments on that flight back lol. so got home really late and mom was there to pick us up. she seemed thrilled to see us. lol my mom is so funny. we get in the car and she is like.. what trouble did you girls get in? and so we told her we didnt get in any trouble. lol and she was all like... my girls? my girls would have had the entire state of california on alert. lmao these are the times when i absolutely love my family!

:: sunday ::

shopping with kaya cause ali decided to stay a day later than she had planned. so me and kaya spent endless hours at the mall lol. talked about boys and homecoming. we both are going with some major hotties! i got sunglasses and thats about it since i had gotten so much earlier in the week.

so we go to get our nails done and ali calls and says she got to meet tyler hilton. so im just like whatever. and shes like.. seriously. she actually did lol. i was wrong about that one. but it was a funny conversation lol.

pep rally was crazy! good job cheerleaders! i love you ali! it was hell trying to get out of there. alex almost left me lol. that wasnt funny! car ride home was fun though.

:: sunday ::

went homecoming dress shopping with jessica, alex, and ali. everyone found a dress they liked except for ali. that girl is so picky. every dress she tried on looked fine but she thought they all looked terrible. lol i swear she is so stubborn!

jessicas dress is so pretty! its red and like this silk satin material. she is gonna look so beautiful homecoming night! so alexs dress is pink and its got small spaghetti straps. its got lace at the top and like rhinestones along the lace. its gorgeous too! and then mine is strapless and like tan and has gold sparkles all over it. its not really short but it looks like it cause the other two are floor length. omg its so cute!

so then looked around for shoes. alex got hers. jessica found this little gold clutch with these blue beads on it. omg loves it! i had so much fun!

we didnt really do much first period. sat there while she graded the journals. that girl that was a bitch to me yesterday was nice to me today? whatever. i still dont like her. test in algebra was hard! dont think that helped my grade too much.

then chorus. mr. lay had to work with the different groups so me and kaya sat and talked cause ali was up there doing her thing. shelby got mascara on my arm and it took the whole fricken period to get it off. next two periods were nothing. i caught the pen! woo! school just isnt safe anymore. people throwing pens around. its a shame lol. wow i dunno what im saying 

everyone was quiet at lunch today so nothing big happened. took the volleyball test in gym and then watched the volleyball match video. they are doing awesome! 19-4! thats what im talking about! then the science notes. wanted to sleep so bad but she kept walking right by me so i couldnt.

i didnt even really bother trying to look cute. i just kinda threw on whatever. so we got to school pretty early actually. had lots of time to kill before first period but i didnt do much. first two classes were really boring. watched a video first period and then second period we were supposed to take notes but i didnt. i just sat there and pretended to listen.

so then chorus. im so glad i have this class! like seriously i would die without it. omg jessica looked so beautiful! she had her hair all curly and stuff. wow. she looked amazing! it was funny though cause mr. lay handed her the little microphone set thing. and when she put it on her head it pushed her hair back so her hickey was showing. and mr. lay was all like... what is that? and shes all like.. huh? and hes like.. on your neck. it looks like something bit you. and shes like... something did bite me. lmao! me and ali cracked up. 

so in english we finished that book. im happy about that. then in computers katelin did her presentation but the rest of us still have to go. lunch wasnt exciting. all we did was eat lol. so then gym. now that was funny. we went into the weight room. ali did one set of one instead of three sets of six. that was pretty funny. 

so then over to science. that test. totally failed. that class is driving me crazy. we have one week until fall break! i am so fricken excited! we are probably gonna go visit lindsey! i hope so!"

get to school. new pictures for the lockers! so put those up while talking to libby and kaya at the same time. like two different convos going on at the same time. thats more than i can handle. hahah. 

first period. i am a bad girl. i have an overdue library book. lol kelsey is all like.. have you even read any of it? nope i havent cracked a single page. then algebra. i need to drop that class. i got every single problem on the homework wrong. so now he wants me to come to tutoring. screw that.

then to chorus. logan and jessica have officially announced that they are a couple! eek! im so excited! its so cute! i love it! lol the rest of the class was just a blur of surrealness. haha im funny.

english was boring. really hyper in computers today. i dont know why. i just was. libby looked so cute today. decked out in her little purple outfit. shes so pretty! started on the presentations. none of us presented ours today. libby and ali were playing guns with the rubber bands and they hit me in the back and i screamed lol. it was funny but it hurt.

nothing else good happened until the school day was over. i actually like fell asleep in science. i was so bored. and tired too. so after school me and jordan were looking into the chorus room through the band room window. they were having show choir auditions today. omg it was so funny! mr. lay was like teaching them the choreography. that was some dirty stuff! lmao! he was like doing body rolls!

so then i snuck into the practice room where alison, caitlin, sarah, and jessica were. and they all were watching it and laughing. and then he can see us watching it and tells us to go away. it was so fricken funny! not many big men can move like that. lmfao!

so after alex was done with her board meeting we drove over to the lonestar steakhouse to eat. and we were mean and told them it was my 15th birthday lol. so they came out and started singing to me and the whole restaurant like joined in. lmao alex was dying! so they give me this gigantic sundae filled to the brim with brownies, ice cream, and chocolate! and alex goes... it looks like youre eating diarrhea. lmao!

:: monday ::


so yesterday i rode to school with alex. got the slips for pictures. omg everything was so boring. life without alison is like life without food and water. i simply cannot live. 

yeah i guess you have pretty much figured out that school sucked. so then had soccer practice after school. saw jessica cause she was working the volleyball concessions for national honor society. she said she was gonna stop by the house as soon as she could so she could talk to alex.

so i got home. did homework. slept for like thirty minutes. skipped dinner because i was so tired. looked through my clothes to see what i should wear for picture day. so then it is time for laguna beach! its about to get interesting lol.

so im sitting in the living room watching it. the doorbell rings. alex gets it. its jessica. so they are standing there talking while im watching the show. and the part where jessica is talking to her friend about her hickey. omg jessica and alex like stopped in the middle of their sentences and turned and looked over at the tv. lol as soon as they heard that word. it was so funny!

so yeah thats pretty much it for monday


:: tuesday ::


wow there were so many things going on today. its not even funny. college fair for alex. pictures for me. so since alex had college fair the parents took off work and rode with us on the way to school this morning. we stopped for breakfast at IHOP. yum.

lol that one teacher getting mad at libby for her majorly illegal socks. lmao! libbys like... im breaking the law. hahah. 

there were no pictures first period cause of college fair. but i got to miss part of algebra! yes! i love how my last name is at the beginning of the alphabet. so then while i was waiting jarrod wanted me to meet his homecoming date. her name is like taddy or something? i dont really remember now. but she was really pretty and sweet.

so then back to algebra just as the bell was ringing. ali was such a nice friend and got all my stuff ready for me. so then to chorus. so im a little confused about the whole jessica and logan situation right now. jessica told me that her and logan werent together and then today they are like in the back of the chorus room kissing? lol i guess she is gonna have to clear that up for me tomorrow.

english was no fun cause ali was called out that period to get her picture done. computers was kinda fun. we are writing these autobiography things about ourselves and we got to use the digital cameras to take pictures and stuff. and then she tells me that she still has all the pictures of my sisters from when they did this project. and she pulled then up for me. they all look so different now!

so then lunch. me and katelin are like.. ice juavas! so had to go down to where alex and jessica and all them were eating and get some money. i was introduced as alexs sister. not even alexs cool sister or anything like that. just alexs sister. but thats ok.

so we went up and got those. went up to get pizza for lunch cause believe it or not those drinks arent very filling. ran into my sister again in the line. had to get some more money from her. so get back and everyone is like eating salads? lol whats up with that?

so then took the test on flag football for gym. then watched a volleyball video. talked to jessica in between classes. she said that she was working the volleyball concessions again so she was gonna drive me home after the game. omg i love her.

test in science. i guessed on like over half of them. i probably did bad. but whatever. not my concern right now. so after school was the game. beat holmes! oh yeah. soccer is awesome.

then went to find jessica. omg that was the best fricken ride ever. our little song lol. gasolina! boom boom boom. i want you in my room. lol we were laughing so hard! she had no time to stay after that though cause she had her spanish class and stuff. but it was fun."

"event","wow sorry for the major lack of updates guys. i know. i suck. im sorry.

how do i even begin to describe today? it was funny but in a really weird kinda way lol. ride to school with alex was fun. i love my big sister cause she is the fricken poop! lol so walk to the lockers by myself cause didnt see any of my friends around anywhere. still dont know what was up with that. 

get to my locker. random convo with libby. peanut butter is bomby? that was cute lol. we all live in a yellow submarine. i didnt even ask about that one. 

social studies wasnt funny. neither was algebra. just really confusing. so then chorus. this is where the fun begins. so me and ali walk in and we start up a conversation with jessica cause shes cool and we love her. so during the middle of this conversation she like flips her hair back and there is this huge hickey on the side of her neck. so me and alison are like omg. so we automatically look over at logan. it was so funny! alisons like.. so logan what did you do last night? and he points to jessica and is like... her. lmfao! but he said he was only joking. and they both deny the whole hickey thing. but whatever. had to get there somehow. it didnt just magically appear. yeah i dont believe it for a second.

so during chorus we had a lock down. so we all went and sat on the risers. so its me ali and then jessica. and jessica looks under the risers and screams and like jumps. and im just like wtf? lmao logan jarrod and david and all the other senior boys were laying under there. lol we were laughing so hard. but we kinda got yelled at for it cause we werent supposed to be making any noise. 

so then david takes the little pointy star prop thing for the play and starts poking jessica in the butt with it. omg it was so fricken funny the first time they did it! she like grabbed her butt lol. aww i love that class. 

so then we had to go out to the stadium for a fire drill which was like the gayest thing ever. it was really hot too. so then to english. that book is so weird. a different person for each chapter? that earl guy that like brings home hookers. and then rafaela who drinks coconut and papaya juice on tuesdays. that book makes no sense to me. ali attempted to explain it but im still lost lol. 

then computers which was nothing special. but lunch was hysterical. if you date terrorists the terrorists will win. lol what was that? then libbys like... you can be three things in life. vanilla, chocolate, or cookie dough. and katelins like... i wanna be cookie dough! lol those girls are so cute.

then had to stay after school cause i had practice. then sat in on alisons practice. lol it was so funny. opera houses used to be like whore houses? that one famous conducter guy that ali and jessica like so much was gay and died of syphilis? jessicas like.. no way! lol that was funny. and then ali goes... not such a big fan of his anymore. and then like talking about some play where the first thing you see is a naked guy slapping his butt? wow. just wow."

"event","crazy day! lots of funny stuff. so breakfast this morning. i call katelins house. her mom answers the phone and im guessing she thought i was someone else cause she like yells into the phone... your checkbook is in your truck in biloxi! and then she hung up. so i called back again and shes like normal? weird. 

so get to school. all the random things with libby. its 9:03 somewhere. alot of people did their moms. doesnt your name mean deaf? hahah. you mean mute. that was funny.

chorus was fun. he asks us what we want to name our choir. jessicas like.. i think we should be the ritardandos. lmfao! you have to be like a musical person to get that lol.

so all of the other classes were kinda blah until computers. had a class discussion on conflict. she asks for an example of conflict. that weird shawn kid raises his hand and is like.. if i were to crawl under the carpet that would create conflict cause there would be a big lump there cause of me. and then me and katelin are like.. carpet crawler. lmao!

so after that moment passed we were split into groups and had to give examples of conflict. so katelins like... i think we should have two hobo people fighting over a burrito. and libbys like... id be pissed if someone stole my burrito. lmao that girl is just too funny! 

and so we like go to present our examples and libby is our speaker for the group lol. lord help us. and so shes like... alison and hillary are fighting over some guy. and then jadens like.. in the mud? that was funny lol. 

so then our next example libbys like... so im over at alisons house who is kinda trying to be a vegetarian. which is true lol. so then shes like.. i see this big juicy steak and she tells me not to eat it and i say no cause im definitely gonna be having some of that steak. omg it was hilarious!

so then i was walking out to my sisters car and checking my messages and ali left me one yesterday on her car ride home with jessica. it was cute. alisons all like... say hi. and jessicas like... im driving! they are so cute. i swear they should have been sisters lol. or at least related.

lol today was funny. tomorrow is alisons big day! and biancas! i hope you girls have a great day!"

"event","wow i havent updated in quite a few days. sorry about that guys

:: thursday :: 


had to get up super early cause i had a team meeting before school. another morning without breakfast. so classes were good? if anything was funny i dont remember it now. lol my apologies. 


:: friday :: 


took kaya to school. crazy day! assembly first period. sat in between cameran and ali. this was the gayest fricken assembly i had ever been to in my life! all it was was this woman like bragging on herself for an hour. she comes out and the first thing she said was... i have been a model and actress for over twenty years now. it was so funny! cams like.. if shes so successful how come weve never heard of her? and then alisons like... twenty years? i didnt know she was that old. that made me bust out laughing it was so funny.

so anyway this woman was like talking like she was black. she was trying to use all this slang and it just wasnt working. lol shaina turns around and is like... this chick is some serious white chocolate. lmfao! ali laughed so loud! 

so then in computers libby and ali writing notes. seriously the weirdest note ive ever read. ali says shes starving and then libbys like... so am i. i bet you can hear my stomach right now. glurp glurp glurp. wtf? is that what stomachs sound like? i know mine doesnt sound like that lol. 

so then ali had to do lunch with her cheer coach so that left me with kaya, libby, and cam. and so kaya thinks that cam looks like blake lively. and once she said it i like thought about it like the whole rest of the day. 

so i guess that kinda got us all in the mood for sisterhood of the traveling pants. so libby has this brilliant idea that the four of us should go to the mall and find a pair of pants that fit all of us. and i had no plans so im like.. what the hell? so found some pair of pants at american eagle. even though our bodies arent really different except for me and cam are way taller than libby and kaya. but we just go with it. 

so then libby wants to go make up rules for the pants. cams like.. lets not get carried away. lol that was funny. we decided that kaya was lena so she gets the pants first. and im carmen so i get them in like a month? lol funny stuff.


:: saturday ::


woke up around 9. libby called and said i was coming over to her house. so i got ready for that and then headed over there at like 10. so we were helping put boards over her windows cause of this monster hurricane thats coming. we were trying our best lol. even though we only ended up killing eachother with the boards and getting in trouble. they attacked me! lol it so wasnt my fault. 

so then her parents are like... separation. so they sent me inside to watch the weather forecast. so i go inside and im watching. and the weather guy says that we arent even in the radar anymore. so im like omg! so i run outside and im like... hey the hurricanes not gonna hit us anymore. and they are all like.. are you kidding me? 

so we take the boards down and go back inside and chill for a little bit. and so libbys mom is flipping through channels and what do you know? it lands on the weather channel right when its saying that our area is expecting hurricane winds up to 100 miles per hour. and of course all heads turn to me! how is it my fault that weather stations are always changing their minds? so then her parents are like.. you screwed us hillary. so im like.. your welcome. and all three of us just bust out laughing. we are such dorks.

so then went to see red eye with those hotties. i love that movie! except for the part where that guy got stabbed with the pen and the high heel? that was pretty yucky. so then got picked up by my dad. dropped those losers off at their houses. then back home and bed around 12 or so.


:: sunday ::


woke up too late to go to church. so then kaya called and said we were going shopping. so i got ready for that. then the two of us went to the mall and looked at all these dress shops. found the cutest dress! it was like teal and had like this little starfish pin. it was so cute but expensive! like majorly! 

so then got like lemonade tea? then got chinese! orange chicken. these guys in front of us were farting. it was really gross. then our fun chats. we sat there and like talked forever. hahah. follow me through this hole! im like... pave the way! 

so then like sitting on the wall and waiting for alex to come pick me up. she did. dropped kaya off and the home for a little bit. got there like at the same time as my dad. he was carrying beer inside? im like... whats he doing with all that beer? and alex is like.. hurricane party. it was the funniest thing ever! so then when we get inside hes like.. your sisters coming. eek! yay! i havent seen danielle in such a long time! so im excited lol. 

so then over to jordans house. all the girls were there. some of the guys too. caterpillar! that was gross. libby and the words. spaing? still trying to figure that one out. mitch had his feet in my face? and then cam like almost flashed me. whoaaa keep those inside. then playing halo. i was the champion. these boys got nothing on me. 

so then took the party back to libbys. first stop at the gas station. me and kaya took forever picking out chips. and then libbys like... you guys act like theres no chips at my house! im not chip deprived! lol that was funny. get to the house. watching the video music awards. jarrod took my blanket. the guys think kelly looks hot singing in the rain? fantastic."

"event","sooo the spider fiasco of last night. hahah. youll get a kick outta this one.

after i finished playing around with my xanga a little bit i came upstairs to go to bed. when i get there theres this gigantic spider on my ceiling. and im just like hmmmm looking at it. and then i decide it must die so im like screaming for my dad to come help me. and he comes into my room and hmmmm just looking at it again. then the spider comes down from my ceiling and is like inches away from my bed. so i run to get paper towels. i come back and my dad is ready to squish it with my pillow. and im like.. nooo i like that pillow! and so he picks up the one next to that one and im like noo. so i just crush the spider and its dead. victory is mine!

so this morning. get up and straighten my hair. do my makeup. pancakes with syrup and whipped cream. good way to start off the day. so go and get in the car and then im like... dammit i forgot my science book! so have to run inside and grab it. it took a long time cause i had to turn off the alarm and then set it again. then double bolt the door. and omg all three of the dogs were trying to come out. like i had to slam the door wicked fast. hahah. caitlins england slang is wearing off on me.

so get to the lockers. libby has some book that is literally called the book of useless information. so i was like ok read me something. and so she tells me that catnip is the cats equivalent to marijuana. and alisons like.. omg im like a cat drug dealer! lol that was fricken hilarious.

ali looked really colorful today. like she had on this bright yellow shirt that had like bright green letters layered over a hot pink one. it was really cute lol. like i recognized it from hollister. and then she had these dangly earrings that had like every pretty color on them. and she wore her hair curly today! well apparently she straightened it and then curled it with the curling iron lol. she must have had alot of time on her hands. 

lunch was fun today. lemonade and grilled cheese. also a small bowl of tomato soup. friggin huge dessert bar! me and libby made ice cream sundaes! woot! with marshmallow fluff! libby is like obsessed? that weirdo. the lines from mean girls? boo you whore! that was funny.

so then like everyone has problems with their nicknames. kaya doesnt like hers cause she says everytime she hears it she thinks of people peeing? lol and ali says that she isnt teeny even tho she is. and holly! lmao! she comes up to me and is like... chia? like a chia pet? lmfao!

bad grades on science test. alison got the highest grade in the class which was an 84. know it all. lol im just kidding. i love her. and she thinks shes dumb? ohhh please.

so then after school i had to stay cause we had a game. i watched as much of the volleyball game as i could. our school kicked escambias ass! the junior varsity won 25 to 7. and the varsity won 23 to 10. soccer was close though. ended up being 3 to 2. miss cameran scored the winning goal! yeah!! shes a hott one. lol ily camjam!

so after the game i went to dinner with my parents and alex. sugar loaf cafe! i got sweet and sour chicken. very good. then came home and resisted the urge to nap. then watching one tree hill which was funny but also very touching. 

good day today! i am going to bed!"

"event","got up this morning at like 5:30 cause my mom came in yelling at me for not walking the dogs last night. so i had to do it this morning. it took forever cause pico had to crap like three fricken times. 

so got home. showered and got ready. my whole outfit was like urban outfitters! thats right baby! but yeah didnt look very cute. had to throw my hair up in a bun cause it just wasnt working for me today. 

get to school. walk to the lockers with ali and cam even though they were going a different way lol. and then this big debate once we get there about how cameran thinks her boobs are broken? is that even physically possible? lol to break your boobs? i dunno. 

so sarahs mom was supposed to have her baby today but it didnt happen. if all goes well the baby will be born on thursday. yeah that was a disappointment lol. she showed up in chorus and we were all like asking her questions about it all to find out its still inside her tummy. such a let down. lol jk.

so english today. getting our vocabulary sentences. scotts messed up one? she was tangible on the elevator shaft? wtf? that is dirrty! and then reading alisons one tree hill sentences as an example of what you shouldnt write lol. i felt bad for ali too cause everyone knew they were hers. not to mention that she thought she was gonna brag on them and then she kinda sorta dissed them lol. but i dont think she cared. and so then reading some more in that weird greek mythology book. this boy is about to kill his mom. and she tells him to look at her breasts and think about the times when he would suck the milk and how that helped him grow. kinda messed up.

so had to do some tutorial thing on the computer today. they had this little model person demonstrating posture and everything. and libby leans over and is like.. wow he is sexy! and me ali and katelin just bust out laughing. it was the funniest thing. and then like reading about all the infections you can get from computers. and im like wow i didnt know computers could give you so many diseases. and libbys like omg there dangerous! so now shes like scared of computers. lol funny stuff.

so then lunch. inventing new words. pinkishest. its the color of the curtains. they are pinkish but they are the pinkishest that pinkish can get without being pink. lmfao! and then katelin not eating her chip cause it was shaped like a butt? thats some excuse! hahah. and then katelins like.. i wish my middle name was lynn. then i would be katelin lynn. so cute! and then libby and her gummi bears. the green one is super hott? 

so then after school me and alex were starving so we went to mcdonalds to get food. and we saw this blind lady walking and so i was like... how do blind people order food from the drive thru? and alex looks at me all weird and is all like... hil how do blind people drive? and so i was like idk. and then shes like.. they dont! i felt so stupid lol. it was really funny.

so then when we got home alexs senior pictures were there! omg they came out so good! and so later my mom will choose the one she likes best and hang it up next to taylors. and then next to that is the place where mine will go. so there you have it. my sister is a very pretty weasel and i love her so much!

so then watching gilmore girls and listening to country music while i thought up new nicknames for everyone. omg everyone is so gonna love me tomorrow!"

"event","so. me and ali just finally decided to let the whole thing with the boys go. if they wanna act like assholes thats their problem. but we arent just gonna sit around and wait for them to come around. if they do then thats great. if they dont then we will get over it. 

so after coming to that nice little revolution over the phone this morning i ate breakfast for once lol. i actually had time today. toast with peanut butter and a pineapple cup! sooo good! then headed off to school with alex. 

SS. pretty boring class in which i dont speak unless i am attacked. like nothing happened. just sitting there. bridget had to change her schedule so she could do her volleyball weightlifting. that makes me sad.

so then saw libby talking to kady and brie. my sophomore girls! woot! omg libby looked so pretty. like beautiful! she was wearing like this silk shirt that was kinda a teal color. and then she had like jeans and these blue dangly earrings. she looked so cute! i love her!

english was pretty funny. like analyzing napoleon dynamite? then the vocabulary for that one retarded short story we had to read about some necklace that like caused this family to go in debt? like this one girl is poor and is going to this like formal dinner party thing with all these rich people and she doesnt have a necklace. and her outfit just isnt complete without a necklace. lol that is so dumb. so she borrows one from her friend and then loses it. and she cant pay to replace it so her husband make deals with like these loan sharks and stuff to get money in order to buy a new one. so they buy it and give it back to the lady. and then they spend like the next ten years in debt cause of that stupid effing piece of jewelry. and then she runs into the woman like on the street. and it turns out the necklace was fake! omg what a fricken waste of time.

so anyway the vocabulary lol. she asks alison to give an example of foreshadowing. lmao this is what she says... like on one tree hill how in the first season they totally were giving hints about peyton and jakes relationship and then in the second season they get together. lol and i was laughing hysterically but everyone else was like huh? they had no idea what she was talking about. 

so then computers. me, libby, alison and now katelin! i love that girl! she is so little and has such a small voice. its adorable. so lol she sits down beside us and is like... wheres the keyboard? she like pulls out the shelf thing from under the counter and is like looking for it. and alisons like.. its on the counter. lol shes like ohhh. i love that girl!

lunch. can you unscrew my bottle? what kinda pickup line is that? lol kaya i hope you put that guy in his place. then for science me, ali, katelin, and mika all went out to the football field and like had to measure ten yards with something other than a ruler. ali did cartwheels and was like falling all over the place. 

so then libby riding with us after school. alex dropped us off and we went to the poetry cafe lol where libby taught me how to drink coffee. lol these people like reading these random poems and libbys like clapping and im like.. your supposed to snap! lol everyone was looking at us. 

so yeah i made soccer in case i forgot to mention that. and my record for suicides still stands. hollys determined to break it though. idk. we will see. 

so got picked up and then dropping libby off and then back home. watching tv and such. lindsey called and we talked about the baby and everything. cindy wasnt there. tear tear. i miss my niece! lol i love lindsey so much. shes like.. i swear jake has turned into some damn nutrition nazi! it was the funniest thing cause i could hear him in the background talking about like broccoli. they are so cute! im so excited for this baby!"

so then lots of drama happened. nate dumped vanna so she was all crying and upset. and then later i find out he broke up with her so he could go out with ali. that dumbass. is ali or is ali not with cody? such a fricken idiot!

and as if that wasnt enough. lucas just randomly tries to kiss me today! wtf? i dont get that. and i cant deal with it right now. its just all too much. and he just confuses me. one second hes into me and then the next hes all over some girl. argh! now im like in a bad mood lol.

"event","had an interesting dream last night. some hot guy wanted to be friends with me or something? got up early this morning to finish some homework that i didnt finish last night. since we had that assembly the other day we got loaded with algebra homework! so after that i got all ready and cutesy and headed off to school.

the second i stepped into the school im being ambushed by friends. then lockers with libby and alison cause kaya was running late this morning. some interesting talks. sometimes you gotta eat a rotten banana. it builds character. libby was that supposed to be some kind of analogy? 

so first period. ms. spozzios name sounds like some kinda spaghetti lol. that was funny. then the poking fight in algebra which was the most painful thing in the world! alisons little dance to you got served. cute ali. 

then chorus. corey saying he was a russian spy. and all his questions. do you want chocolate up your nose? lol when does anyone ever want chocolate up their nose? lol your a loser but i like you anyway. then climbing over all the desks in order to talk to my girls. ali had a really cute bag that i had never seen before lol. it was all cute and sequiny. then ali being like... whats your flava? tell me whats your flava. 

lol then kaya complaining that her toothbrush was ugly. that came out of nowhere. nothing exciting for the rest of chorus and nothing at all for english. then to computers. lol libby is the most random friend i will ever have. love is too strong of a word. i think im in like with you. lets fall in like. does she know how ridiculous that sounds? 

then like looking at the computer and libby is like... its a square of cow! and alisons like.. its actually a cube of cow. and libbys like.. a cuban cow? and all of us are laughing. so then the nine classes of ostriches. the funniest fricken thing ive ever seen in my life! lol libby has been living in a hobbit hole for many many long years. 

so lunch. just me and alison today. no idea where everyone was. me and ali get some mozzarella sticks. sit down and eat them. then ali looks at me and goes.. i got another dollar. so up we go and buy two more. eat those. then im like... i have another dollar. go and get two more. so thats a total of four mozzarella sticks consumed each. yeah then we feel like were gonna throw up. i drank some milk. alison had a capri sun. didnt really help though.

headed outside in order to get to gym. talk with some friends for a couple of minutes. sun. no sun. sun. no sun. thunder. starts to pour. us like running lol. my elephant is still being held hostage by those evil boys. they have many cruel ideas for it. no clue where he is now. i think they have him hidden in their PE lockers buttt thats in the boys locker room and i cant exactly just go walking in there. so mean! as taylor states ""a vacation"". yeahhh right. im the bad owner? i keep him tied up? ridiculous.

so then science. pretty much stared at a candle the whole period and watched it burn. then like talking to alison from her bus window. and then the hott police cop walks by. and ali is like... yeahhh baby! you work it mr. riley! lol and then she ducked back inside and he like looked at me cause he thought i said it. lol i was like nooo. then home for a bit. got ready for shopping with alison. was gonna wear the flamingo shirt but i passseddd and wore another shirt. uhh so then went to pick up ali and we drove overrr there. she was wearing capris and like a pink halter. she claimed she looked junky but she really looked cute. 

so get there. look for homecoming dresses. try like everything on at the store but dont buy any of it. got a bathing suit. this green swirly one that i tried on once with kaya but never got around to buying. so us sexy mamas marched on down to abercrombie and looked around. they wanted like $60 for a fricken tank top. so not spending that much. looked at some shoes. ali got some really cute ones! to hollister and tried on the really cute white beaded shirt but i like broke it lol. and it was the only medium so i couldnt buy it. had to get the black one instead. 

then got home. ate some pizza my parents left out for me and took a nap. woke up to fifteen missed calls and four new voicemails. lol since when did i become so popular? excited for the weekend!"

"event","ohhh yesss a very interesting day right from the start. start the morning off in the kitchen with alex and my mom. alex is freaking out cause she has senior pictures today and shes having some problems lol. so while shes totally flipping her shit im on the phone with ali and libby. yeah three way calling kicks some serious booty! so then libbys like you fugly slut! and her mom in the background is like... libby! lmfao!

so since alex was taking such a fricken long time i rode the bus with ali. and then she turns around to talk to marc and is like.. hey marc i have three questions for you. and so hes like whaaat? and so alisons like... where do you go when your lonely? where do you go when your blue? where do you go when the stars go blue? lmao! that was the most hilarious thing ive ever heard. and then marc is just like... uhhh. and alisons like... your supposed to say you follow me you idiot!

so then get to school. nothing good happened in first period. algebra may have been funny. i cant recall. nate is blind. hes also a freakinggg loser. chorus was the funniest thing in the world! some girl tells the class she had dinner with pat benatar. and all of a sudden alison just goes.. love is a battlefield! and she got the whole class laughing. 

so then after that all the people are like introducing themselves to the class. its our way of ""getting to know eachother"". so sarah says she likes to play solitaire. and then mr. lay is like isnt that a word? and im like idk! and then that one girl says it means like lonely or something. and then everyone was like trying to use it in a sentence. i was feeling solitairely. i dont think thats a word lol.

so then after sarah this other girl i dont know who is like wicked skinny cause she went on some diet with her mom. lol she tells us she can scuba dive and mr. lay somehow thought she said that she saw dead people. lmao! and then that one senior girl jessica who plays the piano for our class tells us her nose is fake cause she broke it and like shattered everything in it. so its not real. and some girl like pulled her groin? another girl has fifteen brothers and sisters and twenty two fricken nephews and nieces! real interesting group here lol. 

then some more crazy times in english. asks me to give a description of ali. ali is so pretty if she was a hamburger at mcdonalds she would be a mcgorgeous. lol that was cuuute! and then so she tries to describe me. and shes like... if i could fit all of hillarys prettiness into a cereal i would eat it every morning. lol we are so fricken adorable. people are lucky to be friends with us.

then computers. new desktops on the computer. libby had a beach. alison had like this field of yellow flowers. and i just had some boring old dumpy hill. libbys like i see harry potter in the clouds! and me and ali are laughing because that girl just shouts out whatever is on her mind lol. so then we are trying to find pictures in the clouds. ali finds a bra on mine lmao! and then were like trying to decide what cup it is lol. ali like has nothing so we like invent a boomerang. lol we are like trying to point it out to her and shes like... i dont see it. well thats cause its not there lol.

so then we get over that and have to do this following directions paper. so the first direction is to read everything carefully. so i get to like question ten and then stop cause its all easy. so i go back up to the top and start working on it. and then i get to thirteen and it says to shout your first name really loud. so i do and everyone in the class starts laughing at me. and im all confused. and alisons like... you were only supposed to do number one. thats what the very last direction says. omg i felt so stupid!

so then the three of us are chatting. weird notes again. drop the chocolate! from wibbleton to wobbleton is sixteen miles. and alison thought we said wimbledon and was like... that tennis movie? lmao and then randomly libby is just like... wheres waldo?! and ali goes.. is that your dog? and me and libby are like laughing hysterically. ali was definitely a little slow today. i dunno what was going on with her. it was funny though. 

so on the way to sixth period its raining like really hard. and there are no covered walks so me alison and cody are getting like completely drenched. and then im like... kiss in the rain! kiss in the rain! and when they do they do it when im not looking. but i saw it cause im good like that lol. 

my elephant was stolen by michael and taylor. sad face. then alison reading my palm. i shall marry a guy with dark brown hair. 6' 2 basketball player. hates his dad. cant cook. blue eyes. wild (in bed?!?! yes pleaseee) lmao! just kidding! actually sounds kinda like nathan on one tree hill. exactly like nathan if you think about it. but doesnt that kinda contradict my life on mash? oh welll. both are good."

"event","ehh once again a pretty regular day. had some stupid assembly that took up like half the day. that speaker... he was pretty okay looking maybe hott? pretty darnnnn goood! alison was like cracking up during the whole thing. it was pretty interesting.

to the lockers after that. kaya i love you but we have got to fix your locker girlie! me and ali have pictures and ali has the cute little button magnets that hold up her pictures. and her mirror! so fricken cute! and kaya baby you have nothing. but dont worry. cause me and the lovely lady that is alison are gonna fix that problem. lol see how much we love you!

then to the afternoon classes. english first which was hilarious. all the porn drawings in the margins of the books! and then joey asking me if my body was a wonderland? i like almost died laughing. weird looks were getting sent our way. magical stories with alison. yeah i really like that class.

then to computers with alison and libby! libby was like having an argument with someone about waffles? the really unusual notes they were writing eachother. i cant stand on my tippy toes so i have to sit on my tippy butt. libby that makes absolutely no sense at all. the cute shirts everyone was wearing. the sparkles on alisons shirt kept coming off. lol she was like leaving a little trail everywhere she went. that was a really cute outfit! my favorite one ali has picked so far. 

lunch. the group was me, alison, kaya, mika, and sarah. sitting next to the girl from algebra who has really cute earrings. shes really nice. i think her name is janessa? ill have to check up on that. but all of us were like so hyper! saw corey and he like yells to me... i got a freaking bottle of whiskey! lol me and mika played lemon. nasty game but strangely amusing at the same time.

so all of us are sitting there talking and then nate randomly comes over and tells me that when i am sleepy i am as unresponsive as a rock. he flicked me in the head. not nice. he also says that when im happy i stand on one leg. which i demonstrated for everyone who was watching lol. i was like screaming in the hall and ali was like... i can hear you from all the way overrr here! yeahhh then cait was psycho and i likeddd it. must do that more often. 

crazy gym class in which i was scared for my life. had to run sprints and nearly ran over that nice girl cause me and alison just run people over lol. i was still hyper maybe? i have a bad memory. ummm.. crazy science! dear lord. darnnn you child. paper airplanes. my table was productive. hahah. we are interesting people.

uhhh what else? cody got in trouble. hahah that kid. he kept pulling my hair and then tried to bite me. talking like a hick. we are not from the country. one of these days im gonna give him what he deserves lol. 

so then to alisons for a bit after school. ali was there of course. then me, libby, kaya, and jordan. gets no hotter! but yeah alisons house is always the best. play some random game. lol it was hilarious. kaya likes big butts and cannot lie. ali is an oscar mayer weiner because everyone is in love with her. lots of fun and randomness! fooling around with the video camera. alison: libby what is your favorite part of your body. my HUGE boobs! lmfao! that was too good. that sure makes one hell of a home video. omg what would i do without these girls?

so then running down the stairs. almost tripped and died. played frisbee in the house. ali freaking out about her one tree hill issue of teen people that came in the mail today. uhh jordan dropping her cell? coookiesss! all of our bases? the talking ones. bop it. i kicked all of their butts. hahah niiiiice. looking out the window. lots of clouds. then the butt shots. we are crazy girls."

nothing really interesting till chorus. that hott senior guy corey telling me he can shake me like italian salad dressing. whatever that meansss. then in science cody tells me hes gonna go buy a gun. didnt really know what to say so i was just like okkkk. he is such a weirdo. i need to beat him up. 

lunch was fun. stopped by my locker with ali so i could put my algebra book in my locker. had to go outside to get there. senior pictures going on in the courtyard. saw julianna! i love her so fricken much! she is my favorite senior! and yes that includes my sister lol. she looked so cute! hugs for me and then a few minutes worth of conversation. saw jenna after that! and theres my second favorite senior! lol she works at the rib shack! hott stuff right there.

ok so i love kristin. but the one thing i dont like about her is how shes so mean to taylor. i mean she seems like she really wants to be friends with them but they just push her away. and while we are on the subject of taylor. her and talan need to hook up so bad! that would be the cutest thing ever and i cant wait till it happens! that was so cute when he said he would marry her!

jessica and jason. she needs to break it off with him. its obvious hes hooking up with alex. just because jessica thinks she cant get every guy she wants doesnt mean she should settle for one that takes advantage of her.

so i guess stephen and LC are finally together? its kinda hard to tell with them. i like them together though. i think they make more sense as a couple. and lo was in this episode! yay! shes my favorite. she is so cute and the hair flips were adorable lol. 

cute episode. cant wait to see what happens next!"

finally got to the fricken parking spot cause it was crazy and there were cops everywhere. reminds me of the little incident i pulled at registration. that was some funny stuff. alexs random friends? introduced me as ""the little sister"". thanks alex. i have a name and its hillary. 

so get inside. confusion. lots of it. didnt know where i was going. finally got my schedule and had to have alex walk me to my class cause i was getting like lost. many many wrong turns i tell you. all the freshman guys like checking her out. lol eyes off the sister. shes not for you. 

saw alison! chickenhead number one! she looked so cute! the outfit... like dark blue and purple layered tank, the white pants, black flip flops that i tried to steal once but wasnt successful, and the chandelier earrings! and the straightened hair! just the cherry on top lol. so cuuute! i love that girl to itsby bitsy teeny weeny pieces!

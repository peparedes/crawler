"event","<font color=""#808080"" size=""3"">Okay poll time. How many of you have had the chance to have sex with a drop dead beautiful blonde, dressed in nothing more than a barely there slave outfit, which might I add is based on a Star Wars Princess costume? Anyone? And if I added she is a vampire? The words best creature for sucking just about anything? Yeah, I&nbsp; thought not. So how lucky am I that I got to marry this girl. Now for part two, how many of you are good at sex? Any hands? Well, I am if she does scream so herself. And I say this with the greatest sense of bragging intended. I am good, really good. I make a woman come like she's pulling 6g's, while riding a naked rock-hard Blue Angel in a Fireman's hat. And yes, I will openly admit a good part of that skill is my partner. She's not exactly shabby herself, and if I was less of a man than I am, she would have me screaming right along with her. But, I digress. The point being this was a great Halloween, full of treats and a few tricks I was not aware she could pull off. I really love Angelin, and not just for the great sex, but the way she holds me when we just lay there together, or the way I feel her press back into me at night like I may get up and leave any moment. Right now, I rather enjoy life. Just as I enjoy sex with my wife.</font>"

"event","<p><font size=""3""><font color=""#808080"">I know I should be sleeping now, I should be nice and warm curled up with my wife in bed, but I just can't sleep. I can't sleep because I lay awake and think about where I went wrong. I think about how I wanted a family and a real life that was more than just blood and death on cold nights. The truth is I missed being a dad, I missed having little hands tug on me, and knowing that small smiles awaited me every morning. I miss being ""daddy."" I missed it all, the good and the bad of it. And I had to try, at least one more time.<br /><br />But dreams have a way of dying on people. And when they do it's a pain that takes a lifetime to heal if ever. It's my fault thought, it's me fault that Angelin is unhappy now and we failed to have that family. She didn't want kids, I asked and she always said she wasn't ready. But then again, whenever do I listen? I pressed and waited until finally she gave in. And I did the worst thing one can do to another, I gave her false hope. We came close, so close to welcoming that new life, but in the end it was stripped from us, and all I managed to do was reduce her to tears. She thinks I blame her for what happened, and truth be, I blame only myself. I am enjoying the best sex of my life, and yet, I feel greedy in wanting it to end in a child.<br /><br />So what now? What does one do when there is no more hope? Secretly I have been looking into ways to aid our attempts. Dark things written in books I don't think we are willing, or even sometimes able to attempt. I have travelled down to places in this town where people that claim to magics gather. I have tried creams, potions, chants, anything. Still, nothing works. I know have the woman I have always wanted in my life, and yet still somehow I feel incomplete. I know that she went to Steven for that normal life she wanted, and if he had never died maybe, just maybe she would have a child by now. Did I ruin something that could have been everything to her? I know I didn't kill the boy, but I never really helped them along either did I? I never reached out a hand and said ""<i>Good luck you two, I hope you have a good and happy life together.</i>"" I should have, I should have as sire and as a friend. If I really loved her, maybe I should have just left once and for all?<br /><br />But it's too late for all that isn't it? I try to forget, I try to forget that I was not what she wanted in life, that I am just what she now has left, but I can't shake it. I can see that things aren't right for her when I look at her. And when we make love, there is Steven's initials staring back at me every time, mocking me about how she will always belong to him, and I am merely keeping her happy until she can return to him. Angelin of course would say none of this is true, that it's all in my head and that she loves me to no end. I believe she loves me, I know that we have shared so much together that there is a bond no one else can ever have. But it pains me that I can't be everything for her, and it hurts me to know, that in the end, if soul mates do exists, it may not be me. I just don't know how to handle that.<br /><br />I suppose in the end, the only thing I can really do is hang onto her and hope that not only will we get our miracle, but that in the end of things, I am the one she wants to be with. I know none of this seems very manly or kindred like, but I am not your normal kindred. I have feelings and wants as I did before I was changed. I didn't lose my unrests or desires, I just had to push them aside for a while. I love my wife, I wanted to share a real life with her. I wanted to see her holding our child.</font><br /></font></p>"

"event","Errands, I spent the entire day doing nothing more than running errands. I took a few outfits of mine down the street to be cleaned. I also went to the store to get some cleaning supplies for the Sil, flowers for my wife, and I even went by a local toy store to see what I could pick up for the baby. I know the baby is gone, I have no delusions about it, but it seems like when you're doing these small things, life just flows by. There is something soothing in knowing that even though your life is a wreck, the rest of the world goes on.  Angelin and I are enduring one of the hardest things we shall ever be faced with. And to the rest of the world, it couldn't mean less. Everyday people die, fathers, mothers, and children. And while this alters everyday of your life from then on, the rest of the world spins just the same. I don't know many things for sure these days. I don't know what I want from life, I don't know if I will ever be a father or if one day Angelin will decide to leave me again. All I do know is that right now, I'm in pain. I hurt right down to the soul I am not supposed to have. The only thing that keeps me going is Angelin, the love I have for her. If I can't have kids, I can live with that. I just live without her. And so I'm going to go give her those roses now, and just be happy that I have her there.

I love my wife, and I know she loves me."

"event","It's been very long time since I wrote anything down, and I have a good reason. It's been a roller coaster of a month this time around. To my complete delight Angelin told me that we are expecting our first child. And while I must admit the attempt at the conception was more than a touch of fun, I was so glad to finally have a little bundle on the way. I spent two weeks changing on of the rooms here into a nursery for the baby. Everything for once was going right. I have the girl I love with me, and then a little one on the way. Or so we thought.

Sadly it seems fate is not going to be so kind to us. Angelin lost the baby a few nights back. No, I take that back, that doesn't sound right at all. Angelin didn't lose it, it's not her fault and I never want her to think I believe that. It just seems that I was never mean to be a father, at least not for very long. I miss having children around me. I know in my heart, whatever kind of monster I have become, that my true joy is taking care of others. And while I would be perfectly happing just taking care of Angelin for eternity, it felt right to have another little one on the way. Once she fell asleep, I spent the next few hours throwing up everything I had managed to acquire the night before. I'm better now, I think the reality is fading once again. All I can do is hope that the next time we find ourselves in this situation, the baby shall  make it into the arm of his or her parents. As far as the little one that was lost is concerned, I will always consider you my child, born or not. Your parents will miss you very much, and your daddy will always hold you in his heart. Goodbye my little treasure, daddy loves you."

Last night she dropped on me that she is ready to have children again, with me thankfully. I don't know what changed her mind, or why exactly now is the time, but I will not question it. Last night was both erotic, and with luck, productive. I suppose if she reads this she is going to know now, that I have been trying to get her pregnant for a long time now. Now it's not as bad as that sounds. she can't get so unless SHE wants to as well. So there was no danger of me really forcing her into it. I just couldn't bring myself to make love to my wife every night and not ""give my all."" I just hope she knows how much i love her, and that i will forever be with her and our family. As for the sex, I want more, and I want it now. I mean have you seen my wife? Who wouldn't want to go at that?"

"event","There is a point when something stops being a love turns into an obsession. One could argue this point to me about Angelin. It's been how many years since I saw that little shy thing walk into the Blood Tears Inn? I remember how cute she looked in her dress. How the light shined off her golden hair, and her smile made the room light up. I won't say it was love on first sight, but I did know from that moment that this girl would mean something to me. How could I have ever known what it would turn into? If follow this girl to the ends of the earth just to make sure she was safe. I'd fight with her sires and lovers out of a need to see her loved, if not a selfish need to love her myself. She is everything I have ever wanted, and finally I have her. She is my wife, and I no longer have to watch her hang off another man, or curl up at night and wish she was beside me.  It took me all of a week to see this is what I wanted in my life. It only took her a bit longer to figure out the same, and for that I cannot fault her. I love her, and while I may not be able to say it as poetically as she? I mean in no less.

You're the one for me. 
Your eyes are like fire on a cold winter's day 
Your soul burns within me 
Your touch blossoms my innermost passions 
And your voice melts my heart. 
You're the one for me. 
You are the key to unlocking 
My most sacred fantasies. 
You're the one for me, 
The one that wakens me 
When I'm at my deepest sleep 
With your passionate ways, 
The one that rivets me with 
Your beautiful, unique face. 
You're the one for me. 
You are the one that I want to share 
My life, my love with for all eternity. 
I will love you always and forever. 
You're the one for me."

"event","I am not sure how exactly it started. It's all a blur in some ways and all too clear in others. I remember being at the bar watching couples dance, the music, the splendor of it all. A bar isn't quite the word I should use however, more like a ballroom with a two drink minimum. People twirl around in tuxes and evening dresses to grand musical scores. Angelin had gone back to the cabin for the remainder of the day to retreat from the sun, and I was just about to head off to join her when I noticed my wallet had vanished from the bar top.  Not a huge loss, there wasn't much in it, but still it was stolen just the same.

So back to the cabin I went at this point until I saw a man leaning against the outer rail of the ship with what looked like my wallet in his hand. To be frank the guy looked like a used car salesman more than a thief. Or is that simply redundant? I do have to admit the balls on this guy are huge, to stand there in plain sight of anyone that walks by with another man's wallet. Him and two of his little buddies talking it up about this and that, how they should split the money and all that criminal crap. I'll admit to being angry, I'll even admit to being amused. But what happened next had nothing to do with either the wallet or the money inside. Money can be replaced as can some cheap leather wallet. No what happened next hinged solely on the words that left the man's mouth. A little comment offered to his buddies in a moment of jest I suppose. When he came across the picture of my new lovely wife, he made a comment, something on the order of. ""Maybe should find this hot chick and give her a good fuck. She looks like she would be a fun bang. I'll even let you guys have a turn with her.""

This is where it becomes a blur really. I remember the screams, I remember the blood, and I remember his two little buddies running off and laughing and leaving before I did anything. I am not stupid even in anger. You don't attack three men on a boat out in the middle of the ocean unless you kill them all. And even then, there will be questions on how someone goes missing. However I remember the third man, Mr. ""Fuck my Wife,"" screaming in pain as I snapped his arm from behind. I didn't give him a chance to run, nor call for help, or even beg for his life. Nor did I even bother to kill him straight away. No, I tore his throat out for what he said. But not enough for a fast death, only enough to ensure his death would come. With my wallet in hand I kneeled before him and held up the picture of Angelin. I even took enough time to gloat about what I had done, saying something like, ""I'm the one that fucks her, whereas your just simply fucked,"" or something on that order. And then I just tossed him overboard. I left him to die, alone in the sea, far away from this ship and the one thing on it that means something to me.

It was a challenge to get the blood off the deck, it took my shirt and quite a few minutes of scrubbing to get enough off to hide what I had done. With luck, no one will miss him for a few days. And even then maybe they will assume he fell overboard. I may be some kind of monster, but I regret nothing about this. We only have a few days left on this ship and I plan to enjoy them with her, not worry about what may happen about this guy. I went back to the cabin, slipped into the shower and removed his soiled blood from my skin. And before this ship docks I plan to find his friends, I am not sure if I will kill them for their part, but I damn sure intend to make them remember me. But right now I intend to slip into bed, wake my sleeping wife, and fuck her hard. Because that is what only ""I"" can do to her."

Well, perhaps in this case not s a new love but an old one. Mrs. Angelin Vivalis Rouge, hell it even sounds nice to say. The story behind it is that after years of following this girl around like a little lost puppy, I finally got her to say yes. Or more to the truth we both got each other to say yes, because we both came up with the same idea at about the same time. I brought her to the place where I had intended to marry her, and she brought the paperwork, so that worked out fabulously.

And now here we are on this cruise for our honeymoon. I must admit to myself I am enjoying it quite a bit. They have dances at night which is perfect for us. Games, a huge pool, and food galore. Okay so the food part sucks, I really do miss eating food. One of the little drawbacks of eternal life I suppose. But worth it in the end to be forever with the one you love. I'll just have to force myself to enjoy the scent of the salt water at night, the coolness of the breeze that washes over the ship, or maybe it's the nonstop sex with the hottest woman I have ever known. I swear to God this girl has an ass that just makes you want to spend a lifetime doing not so sweet things to her. And I shall, repeatedly, and from many angles. But right now she is sleeping next to me, and it's really hard not to just reach out and let my fingers drift over her skin. I don't know how she managed to keep the same effect over me for so long. Ever since the day I first saw her all I have ever wanted to do was just touch her. To let my hands hold her close and make sure she wasn't some perfect angel I was simply dreaming up. It seems almost surreal that what I have wanted for so long is now actually mine. Things indeed can work out if you hold onto hope for long enough. and from where I am sitting, I think eterinty will be a great thing for me indeed. I love you Angelin Rouge, and I leave you with a few known facts.

1. Your a beautiful and wonderful woman.

2. Cruises are wicked fun, even if just at night.

3. I probably look odd in a bathing suit, so hold the laughing please.

4. In that conga line, some chick kept touching my ass, but no killing her.

5. I really love having sex with my wife. I'm all up for seconds, or twenty thirds.

I like being married..."

"event","Okay so what do I really have to report here? Let us see, first off the one thing I want to get off my chest is an odd request if not a tempting one. A dear old friend and lover of mine, you all know whom, came to me a few days back and flat out told me she wants a child. Not just any child, but mine. Now I made it very clear she can't have me back, but that doesn't seem to matter, she wants a child anyway. So, not having told my current and hopefully last lover this, I am guessing she'll freak out when she reads this.  I mean someone comes out of the closet and says ""Gee, bang me silly until I have a kid,"" that tends to shake up one's significant other. The good news for her is that of course I am not going to do it. Sure, I wants kids, I miss having kids, but I missed her much more when she was gone, and I am not so stupid as to lose her twice. Not for anything in this world.

So to show you just how much you do mean to me, please choose a nice dress and shoes you can dance in. We are going out tomorrow night for a little romantic adventure. Just you and I, and whomever else is lucky enough to be in our presence there. With luck it will be an evening you'll come to remember years from now. Merry Christmas Angelin Vivalis, I love you."

The man I picked ran a good ten feet before I managed to take him down. Angelin's didn't even manage a step before she had torn his throat out. But then again she has something I will never have, boobs. A lovely set of boobs just perfect for....but I digress.

Anyway we hunted, we teased one another as always. And then I kinda I tugged her into that playhouse for a bit of carnal fun. You have never lived until you have fucked ina  playhouse ten feet off the ground. Not to mention the perfect way a long slide will hold a girl in place when your using her for wicked and sinful desires. Get some footing in the sand, put her legs over the side and enjoy. Which reminds me, make a note to buy her more skirts, those things are damn handy. And the black boots love? Just so hot.

In fact, screw writing this, I'm ready for round two. Ohhhhh Angelinnnn...."

It seems in her pain she has let the place go so I have taken the time today to clean it back up to opening condition. She may chose never to open the doors to this place again, but if she ever does I'll make sure it's ready for her. I've been here for a couple days now, and it doesn't seem like she'll be back to her normal self any day soon. Who can blame her though right? It's not a small matter this time. It's not something I can cuddle away of tuck her in and have it all better by morning. I'll just remain here and do what I can. I sneak out sometimes while she sleeps just to feed. If she won't go out to do it, I'll have to make sure I have enough to share with her. Whatever else has come and gone, she still means quite a bit to me. So I suppose either both of us go on, or both of us stay walled up here forever. Either way, I plan to see this, and her, through to the end. I just wish I could help her more."

So no use on being a damn fool. On a lighter note I have found a way to spend some of my free time. The church a few doors down from me has a nighttime deal where they take in the homeless and such so they don't freeze their asses off. They can get a nice meal and some shelter for nothing, so I volunteered to help. It will take up some of my time, and since I spent years preying on these people it is the least I can do for them.

"event","It's been a very long while since I put anything at all down in this thing, so we have quite a bit to catch up on. Angelin as always seems to be on the verge of insanity. Of course having the love of your life missing and locked up somewhere will do that to you. I do hope the boy is all right, for her sake as well as his. Things in my life however have also taken a little turn for the bizarre. My newest love interest and I have parted, or so it seems. We never talk anymore, at least not since that night of the fight. Of course this is what number fourteen I do believe? I'm getting really good at being really bad at this. So tonight I did what any warm blooded kindred would do, I found a lovely nice girl on her way home from work, I pinned her against a wall, and did my very best to fuck her into screaming submission. Not to worry however, I did feed, but not enough to harm her. Lord knows it may be nice to have something to go back to someday when I need it. It also surprised me how dominating and animal I can be when I am not worrying so much about how my partner is ""feeling"" about me. I understood by the screams she was more than willing to go on, but when I wasn't running all these ideas of ""will she love me tomorrow"" through my damn head, I actually had fun.  I wasn't dwelling on how alone I was, or how much I wanted to impress her, I just did it. So we shall see what comes of this, pun fully intended. I never had a chance to enjoy being young, maybe it's time I started. After all, my car has a big back seat. I may take a lesson from Angelin and Dakota."

I have craved nothing but to be with her for so long now. But the fact remains that she left me for another, and then in turn that one for yet another. In the best of all cases I am nothing more than third place to her. Now I can't be angry, I can't blame her. The heart wants what it wants, and at least she had the courage to leave me before deciding she wanted another. People change, plans change, and we must do out best to fit into the new world we made for ourselves. With that in mind maybe this new budding romance with Alessia is the best thing for us both. I shall no longer have to be alone, and Angelin shall not have her sire hanging about her like some lost child. I only wish I knew what to do, do I abandon hope for this new chance? Or hang in there a little longer in hopes someday she will return my feelings? I'll have to think on this, and in the mean time, no harm in a few dates with the lovely Alessia right?"

All my life I have turned away from things like this, given up and let my heart be broken because it was ""The right thing to do."" Maybe it's time to stop doing the right thing. If it means being happy, maybe it's time for a few wrong one's.

You came so suddenly into my life, within the mere blink of an eye.
Your love that tossed me in the air, and taught me I could fly,
And upon your sweet compassion, and such gentle loving words,
We traveled together hand in hand, and discovered a world unheard.
Of world true romance, compassion, beauty, and of trust,
We knew from the moment we entered, a world that is meant for us.

We ran like playful children, through such fields of joy and pain,
And still through every trial, it is our love which has remained.
Up above our moonlit sky, and so very far from sight,
We wait in thirst together, two children of the night.

And even through this distance, I love you all the more,
A lonely heart grows fonder, Con Bello Amor."

Halley Wheaten, what a looker. You may recall that we lost touch long ago. I had thought she ran out on me, I guess other things happened. To cut right to the chase, my child, the one she was carrying at the time, is dead. That's right, another try at happiness now lost. I think that makes what, four kids I have lost? I guess God, or fate, or destiny, whatever you wish to call it, has now passed that message along pretty well. Your not meant to be happy, asshole! Give up trying to have a family, give up trying to have friends, and give the fuck up on ever being loved. If you were meant to be happy I wouldn't have made you look so good sitting alone in the corners.

On a lighter note though I can't go back in the Rose anymore. That little prick of boyfriend of Angelin's seem to get all pissed if I so much as share the same zip code as she does. The little fucker has the nerve to overdose, risk his life, treat her like some little piece of luggage, then get pissed off when someone tries to be around her and actually TALK TO HER. Those people have the nerve to think I am the monster? That I have problems? Maybe I do have some issues but I have never been a damn thing other than nice and hospitable to those people. The only people in that place that even speak to me are Morgan now and then, and Maiko, and Maiko seems to have gone one serious bye bye. Yeah, Seamus pauses long enough to take an order from me. I guess ripping flesh eating dog's off someone's fucking back is not cause for further conversation later on. Hell maybe he just forgot that we went through some shit together. Now Rose, personally, I like her. But I have had ONE nod from her, never a word. Angelin? Well you all know I am forever in love with her. But if I come to see her, I get this ""Jeremiah is all about Angelin"" bullshit. Well, yes, yes I am. One because I love her, and two? Because you assholes refuse to speak to me, what the fuck else am I supposed to do, talk to the chairs? You can't shut someone out of your precious little circle, and then bitch when they seem single minded for some form of social interaction. But okay, okay, I am done ranting for tonight. I have to save some space for tomorrow. So for now, this is all I have to say about this. For those of you that care, love you all.

I am tired of watching Angelin run off with Dakota for a night of sex. Or Rose and Seamus acting all cute and cuddly. Or even Thora with her new love Duncan. Every time I open my mouth they all jump down my throat about how negative I am. Why can't I just be all bubbly and happy like them? Maybe because I am very lonely? Maybe because I have spent my entire life trying just to be loved, to find that is the one thing I can never have? God it doesn't have to be sex, though that would be wonderful. It's just the holding, the belonging to another. The idea that someone loves you back as much as you do them. But that is not going to happen is it? I can't even seem to make friends no matter how hard I try. And so it is with that in mind I have come to my decision, I only hope they, or she as it were, will understand. I am just so tired.

It seems to me with babies and the condition of repair for the Rose, the Wylie's should have it. If nothing else, it makes me feel better. They have been kind to me, and in place of my own kids, I can help with theirs.  I just hope Angelin didn't take an offense by it. I know how much she cares for Seamus and Rose, maybe that will help.

"event","I really do not know what to write this time around. Angelin's friend Duncan died, and of course she was very upset about that. I felt the waves of emotion crashing into me even from across the city. But when I came to the Rose I saw her in the arms of another friend. Of course, I was jealous for the mere fact that I didn't get to hold her, but I am glad to see she has others to rely on. Still no real word on if I am really welcomed back into the Rose. I know I was never officially banished, but it just feels like I get a cold shoulder in there, and maybe with good cause. It may explain why after so many years I have still do not have any friends or even a girl that really loves me, guess it's me after all. Or the fact they all think I kill people for fun and food.

I think I will make an effort to talk to some more people that hang about the Rose however. I tried to talk once before with Mr. Wylie, but he is always so busy tendering bar that I can't get out more than a sentence in before he is called away. Nice guy though, I hope he and his family are doing well. Just for reference, I met a nice girl called Alessia the other night. Very beautiful redhead, and very sweet. But as we all know, when a girl likes me, something else is up. I am too weary to think anything will ever come of it. About the ninth time a girl ran off on me, I got the idea I was being had. Experience is that wonder thing that lets you recognize a mistake when you make it again."

"event","Tonight was an interesting night. I went to see Angelin at the Silhouette per her request she seemed happy to see me at first. She told me about her childer and how lost she was on how to care for him. For a few moments it was a wonderful night, I had my friend back. And then as it always does, things went wrong. Topher, Steven's best friend came in. I like the guy, but I know he thinks ill of me. Yet that I can handle, it's that seriously cold bitch Katherine that got to me. She waltzes in, insults my childer and when I stick up for her what happens? Angelin turns on me like I was the bad guy. It always happens, every time I stick up for her, or try to defend her, it's ""Shut up Jeremiah."" ""Stay out of it Jeremiah.""

I wonder if she does this to Steven? No of course not. If he did it she would go on and on about how brave and romantic it was. Whatever, I don't care anymore. She says she loves me, but who knows what she means by it. She teases and lures me with sweet words, then tosses me away again the next day. I have to get over her, and maybe one day I will. On the good side apparently Kate has a thing for Topher. She blatantly asked him to go have sex with her. While I must admit I worry for the boy and his well being, damn if I am not quite jealous. Even little nerdy kids are getting laid on the spot. I couldn't get a girl to like me if I was indeed the last man on Earth and she was a raging nymphomaniac. God I am lonely, sex would be great. But even friends would be nice. Very nice."

"event","It's been a long time since I wrote anything in this log. And little has changed that I wish to speak about. Angelin goes on with her new life without me in it. And as if losing one childer was not enough, now Kay has resurfaced after so many years. Yet she is not the Kay I remember. She had purged my blood from her system. She has removed the curse of being a Rouge, and in turn cast me aside. I can't say I blame her, it seems everyone seems to be clamoring these days to be rid of me. Should I take a hint?

And it is on this note I wrote in this book today. How many times have I wandered into the Rose? Thirty? Fifty? How many countless nights have I sat alone at a table wishing that anyone in that damnable place would say one word to me? What did I do so wrong to these people? How angry must I have made them that they act as if I never existed? No matter what I say, or whom I say it to, they all but ignore me. I feel like I am talking to tiny icebergs floating in an endless sea of cold hostility.

Don't get me wrong, I love the people at the Tavern. I love the mix and wide array of personalities and races. I love how the patrons and tenders seem to generally care about one another. And that is why I only wish I could have been a part of it. Maybe they just see me as some worthless vampire, or some lump Angelin just dragged in behind her. Whatever the reason, it is a pity for me. I really would have liked to have friends again. It's been so long since I belonged somewhere, and even longer since I felt a true welcome. I miss my family, I miss, being happy."

"event","There seems to be no end to the dullness. So once again I have nothing to report. With Angelin and Maiko now both googly eyed over their boyfriends I am back to sitting in the corner pretending to still feel anything but hate and sorrow inside. To be honest with myself I still do not know why I haven't ended this. There is nothing left for me here now. No friends, no family, nothing. The occasional table scrap from someone so bored they have no choice but to talk to me, that's about it.

I know I should try to talk to Angelin one last time, but what's the point? It's plainly apparent she thinks much less of me than she lets on. For all these years I thought she liked me, and not just as a friend. I really did. But then Jaric over me, and Dakota following him. It's amazing to me really. I have to wonder just how far down on the boyfriend pole I was. On the plus side maybe if the world ended and all the other males died, she would turn to me rather than be alone. Then again somehow I get the idea she would prefer another species to even me, go figure.

Anyway I guess I will go, there is a dark deserted corner someplace without a solemn lonely man to fill it. I guess my work is never done. Is it so damn much to ask that for once in my life someone would want me over another? I'm tired of being used, I am tired of being lied to. I am tired of trying, when no one cares."

"event","Well, I guess you could say I am a glutton for punishment. I spent the night hanging around the Rose again. Angelin saw fit to go out on a date with Dakota tonight, whoopee. It appears not only did she pick Jaric over me but the rest of the male population of the tavern as well. At least I know the truth about what she thinks of me now, oh well. I guess my fears where true after all, go figure. On the flip side Maiko saw fit to deposit herself in my lap tonight as well. I never can tell exactly what her game is. I mean on one hand she seems to enjoy being with me, but then again she acts the same way with everyone else. It's hard to tell if she is just being her normally flirty self or not. I guess I should be grateful someone is hanging out with me at all, even if it is some sort of joke aimed solely at me. I do worry about her and the baby, however. A girl should never be alone at a time like this. Joke or not, I will try to help take care of her. At least as much as she will allow. At least I am not totally alone.

It's that idea of being alone and other's that have me thinking maybe I should avoid going to the Rose so often. I just get depressed when I see couples together. I remember the feeling of actually having someone care about me, and I miss it. I know now that none of the prior women really did care, they used me. But for a time I thought they had, and I was happy. And then there is the new little one of Tavern. The new baby so cute and small. He reminds me of my own children. The little bundles of joy I once adored holding, and cuddling. I miss them so much. I wish I knew what became of them. I wish I knew what happened to Arinna, my oldest daughter. She was sixteen when I last saw her. I can only hope they have had a good life wherever they may be. I hope they are safe, I hope they remember. But I know they were too young. I miss the life I could of had. I miss what will never be."

Well, no more than usual anyway. As you can tell I have yet to do what I planned. Maybe it's because I still hold hope in my heart. Or maybe it's just because I am a damned fool. I still can't see my life going on without Angelin, but it seems it will have to. It wasn't my choice to make. On a less suicidal note I made a visit to the Rose the other day. Maiko and another girl attempted to assassinate me by tickling. Retribution indeed came swift in the form of a little gift to Maiko left at the doorstep of the Silhouette. Details to come later.

I guess in all things are a little better. Lovely Willow was kind enough to let me feed from her a little. Not really enough to carry me long, but enough to solve the immediate problem. I don't know if I feel the way about her she seems to about me. But maybe I do not have to. What's the harm in giving myself for eternity to one I do not wish to be with? At least I won't be alone anymore right?

Angelin seems to have taken up my philosophy on our little love problem as well. She doesn't really talk to me anymore. And when she does it seems always a last resort. On the plus side though if Maiko, Morgan, Jaric, or one of their household pets are not available, I am first in line for a chat. I guess that is all for now, there really isn't much of a change to report. Things are as they have always been. I get to watch from the outside as a loner and pretend I like it. Angelin goes on with her life and the world spins around us the same as always. To each their own."

"event","Misery is said to enjoy company. Yet my misery finds itself very much wrapped in the veil of loneliness and despair. The end has come before me. It comes not in the shape of a monster, an enemy, or even an unknown stranger, but in the form of the one I cherish most. The one whom has endeared herself so deeply into my heart. It is known to me now that my hopes and dreams, were simply fantasies and illusions. What I thought was her love, was mere pity. And now as I lay here still, pain swelling within the remains of a shattered heart, I weep. I weep for what I have lost, and what I shall never have. The love that will remain longest in my heart, is the one that is not returned. And I know now that I shall never feel the warmth of love, nor the feeling of belonging. For the eighth and final time in my life, a woman has spurned me. She has turned me away andcast aside my love, simply because I was never good enough.

My dearest Angelin, how I had prayed that you would find it possible to love me. I prayed each night to the very God that had forsaken me, that you could find a way to love me as I am. And yet it seems now his curse is as forbidding as it is eternal. Would he choose that I should die in a fiery blaze of ashes? Or worse yet, to live forever. To forever suffer, to remember, and dwell in this state for the rest of eternity.  Alone, miserable, and outcast from kindred and human alike. An existence that in itself is very much a tomb. This place, this warehouse has become my last stand against all unrelenting torments that rage within my mind. The pain, the anger, the loneliness. I must forever cope with my failed existence. A friend, a sire, a lover, a failure on every front. The times I spent with you now blur within my head like a distant dream, a fairy tale. A lie I told myself over and over again in hopes that one day, I may actually believe. Memories can fade with time, but anguish never relents. I always knew I'd look back on the times I cried with you and laugh, but I never thought I'd look back on the times I laughed with you, and cry. Yet every tale must have an end. For me there is no more music to dance by, nor stories left to write. I am ready for what ever should await beyond. May God truly forgive me. I am sorry for my splendid failure to be that which was needed. I am sorry for what I was, and for what I could never be. I am sorry for my existence....

Note: I believe this to be my last entry within these pages. Let it be known to whom ever finds these journals, that while sort in duration, they speak volumes about the human spirit. And let he who reads here understand that not the curse of life, nor the release of death, could ever mend a broken heart. May unfulfilled dreams lay forgotten here within the ashes. As may lost and distant souls finally find eternal rest within our memories."

"event","Well, I think I have found it. It's not much, but it does have a roof and four walls, mostly. While I guess it is technically a machine warehouse, I think it can serve the purpose. There is a nice little place for a cot in the back rooms by the water heater. Old? Damn right. I feel like I need a tetanus shot just looking at it. But I suppose home is home. I should just be grateful I have found a place to stay. A few throw pillows, a rug or two, and the rats and I should be in business.

I am, on the other hand, not quite so confident about the new food source. While I must admit there is no shortage of vagrants around the docks, as nasty tasting as they are, I don't exactly trust their health. That's all I need. To get hold of one source with some freakish African disease. So with the ""purity"" of these sources in question, I think I had better show caution and cut down what little feeding I do. I guess it's all for the best. I needed to lose some weight anyway, I have my mother's thighs.

Oh yes, ""P.S."" . The more I think about the entire Angelin incident, the more it seems that I was not entirely wrong. Through all this mess she has also never once told me she loved me. Not in all these years. Not even the night in question when I turned her down. There was no mention of love, simply sexual need. And I have to wonder now if she ever really did love me at all? Could it be she never has? That while she loves me as her friend and sire, she has never been ""in love"" with me? It does explain a few things about the entire mess. I know she would never wish to hurt me by telling me straight out. But Jeric is allowed to date her, kiss her, etc. I get to play the friend/sire only. Why? Why is it after so many years I suddenly find myself sitting alone, and waiting for her to tell me where I stand? Sitting here making myself sick with worry and regret. Why can't it just be like it was before? Before the Rose. Before, I lost her...

""P.P.S."" I love her....I miss her...I'm sorry Angelin..."

"event","Stupid. Sheer stupidity. How many years has it been? How many fucking years since I met Angelin? Never once did I let it slip that I was in love with her. Through sires, marriages, and kids I kept my damn mouth shut. I never once let it slip and in turn ruin our relationship, our friendship. And yet here I sit now. Here in the empty darkness that was once our apartment. Never in my life have I felt so alone as I do now.

I should have known. I should have fucking known this would happen. Granted she didn't say no, but nor did she say yes. In many ways I think that is worse. To not know. To sit and wonder with dwindling hope. I am sure if I still had a heart it would have stopped beating that very moment. Yet it is my own fault isn't it?  Yes, I know it is. Screwing things up is my singular specialty. I have always done it. How many loves have I lost over time? How many lives have I ruined? Too many it would seem. But now I go and ruin one more. The last person, the only person, that means anything to me.

Who knows, maybe all this pain will come to an end soon enough. I could easily stroll into that park once again and start one hell of a brawl. I bet I could even take a few of the bastards down before I fell. And maybe, just maybe, people would remember me in death as easily as they forgot me in life.

I know I should avoid being around Angelin again. Watching her kiss up on Jeric is not exactly high on my list of favorite things. He gets to hold her, and date her. He gets to take her to makeshift proms and hold her hand. And me? I get to watch them. Just act like a friend and watch it happen in front of me. Yeah, I stand a chance at winning her over. I'm simply screwed.

I guess I will end this little rant now. My time is up here and I have to do my best to find a new place to ""live"". On the plus side I did overhear some vagrants saying that boxes down towards the docks were quite lovely this time of year. Premium cardboard, complete with a waterfront view. Isn't it amazing how when things are the darkest and near the end they can suddenly start looking up? And I thought all the good housing was taken. Silly me.."

After the first few times I realized what a moron I truly was. I never should have stopped Angelin that night. I just didn't know what else to do. I know if I give her my heart she would stay, but at what cost? Is her happiness really so important to me that I would risk losing her from my life forever? Yes, I know it is. Better to keep my heart encased in stone. It would just be broken again when she picks another.

Anyway, as long as I am up I may as well check up on Miss Maiko. Angelin has me protecting her from nothing more than herself I suppose. With Valin gone, she is afraid Maiko may do something less than helpful to herself, and there is a baby to consider here. All in all it's an odd job. Here I am protecting people I know nothing about, and whom in turn care nothing about me. But, it makes her happy, and that is reason enough. Eeven if I do have to hang around those ""dating"" her. And enough said about that I think.

On a last note I need to feed. With my source now gone, the last I had was in a small glass offered by Angelin at the Rose. And I don't think one glass a week is going to cover it. Maybe tonight I'll grow a set once more and find a vagrant or something. Then again, we all know I won't. My unlife sucks.."

That's how these things usually start right? Someone ranting off every little thought into a book. Everyone lost in their own little delusion that somehow the pages actually care what your saying. Or that some sap shall actually one day read it? I'm writing this down simply because I can no longer hide all these ramblings inside my head. It's become such a jumble of pain, anger, and confusion that I fear if I keep it in much longer I shall lose what little I have of myself to it.

I guess I shall start be telling you of the dream I had last night. The same dream I have had every night this week. She's in it of course, why wouldn't she be? I mean it's not like I haven't dreamt of her for the past, well, I forget how many years it has been. Little Angelin, the Angel hidden under that raging see of confusion and anger herself. As I said I had the dream about her again. It always starts the same, us, entangled in a moment of passion, lost in one another as the world went on around us. And then it end the same way, again and again. Her leaving, finding a better life that doesn't include me, like so many before her.

How do you tell someone feelings without changing their life? You can't it seems. To tell them such a thing is to turn their world upside down. And now that she is happy, I think I missed my chance. She's after this Jeric guy so it seems. I still don't know who exactly Morgan is, or what exactly he has to do with all of this, but maybe I do not wish to know. Regardless she has moved on, and I wish I could do the same. Yet when I close my eyes I see her. Maybe the decision to stay out of her life was the best one, then again perhaps not, only time can tell."

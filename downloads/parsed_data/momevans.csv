"event","Poor WVU got creamed and lost a key player.  They can be very proud they made it to the Final 4.

Lazy day at sea except for the ""On Board for the Cure"" 5k walk (13 times around the deck 3 1/4 miles).  The weather was just right.  We have had great weather, although cool, on this trip.  I didn't research well enough and expected that it would be warmer.  I have wished many times for a sweater. The long sleeved jacket I picked up in Puerto Vallarta is sure coming in handy.

I read and relaxed the rest of the day until just before show time.  We sat in the Piano Lounge, listened to the singer there and had a drink.  The show was singing and dancing to Broadway Tunes.  Ho hum.  Leg of Lamb finally appeared on the dinner menu and it was delicious!  It was a formal night and we got dressed up.  The necklace I got in Puerto Vallarta  matched and really set off the dress I was wearing.  I love to get gussied up like this on occasion.

We heard about an earthquake in N. Mexico.  Guess there was some shaking going on in San Diego.  I have to tell you I was a bit nervous looking for a big wave to crash over us but nothing happened.  I just hope S. California doesn't drop into the ocean before we dock and get out of town   :-0

This morning the ship is rolling more than it has the whole trip.  Thank you Dramamine!  Feeling a bit of scratchy throat this morning.  With all the hand sanitizer I've used I'm a bit surprised.  But I shouldn't be, that stuff doesn't kill viruses.  At least we avoided the scourge of a lot of cruise ships-Norovirus.  I've never seen so many hand sanitizer dispensers and so much disinfection going on.  When we were on the train the other day the sanitizing crew came through several times.  Wearing the spay canister on their backs they made me think of ""Ghost Busters"".  They sanitized the train and the buses before we got on each time.

We have really enjoyed this cruise and Holland America.  I doubt we will use any other line if we cruise again.  With the older crowd we enjoyed the entertainment and things to do more than the 'younger crowd' ships.

Well, off to the 'Disembarkation talk'  Later we'll be packing but not before I have the  facial and massage I booked for this afternoon.  We are also invited to a brunch for the 'Mariner's Club'.  That's like the frequent flyers club for cruising.

Tomorrow we fly home and lose 3 hours  :0 but it will be good to be home.  I think 12 days (counting the extra day in San Diego) is too long to be away from home but I'm not complaining.  I wouldn't have given up any of the days we've had."

Still at sea when we get up.  Have a headache so I take a shower and some Zyrtec-D.  Up and moving Doc collects me and we have some breakfast.  Headache not going away and now really nauseous so back to bed.  Spend a good portion of the day there, snoozing on and off.  Doc tries to get me up to watch the as the ship docks around noon.  No can do.

Finally get some relief.  Get up, shower again and go to see the evening entertainment.  The entertainment is a man who plays numerous stringed instruments and different types of music.  He played acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, electric guitar and steel guitar.  His wife, a singer/song writer joined him for a couple tunes.  It all sounded really good.  I had no idea that a steel guitar was so complicated or that it was used for anything but Country Western music.  A steel guitar has 20 strings (2 sets of 10), 8 pedals for the left foot, one for the right foot, two knee bars for the right knee (left and right) and 3 knee bars for the left knee (left, right and up and down).  And he played Hawaiian music on it!  It was quite enjoyable.

I was actually feeling well enough to have dinner which I enjoyed very much.  In spite of all the sleep I'd had I was able to go to sleep and slept better than most nights.  How nice.

BTW I did not forget that it was Good Friday.  On any other day there has been at least one Christian gathering either non-denominational or Catholic mass.  Most days, both.  On Good Friday there is only a Sabbath service.

Saturday April 3rd

Get up feeling well and hungry.  Have large, great breakfast.  Discovered yesterday that they have waffles at the buffet.  I have a waffle topped with mixed berries and turkey sausage that tasted really good.

We sat up on deck for a bit reading the news and relaxing.  Then we got off the ship and did some shopping in a nice little shopping area right on the pier.  Doc buys me a really pretty necklace and earring set. It is a yellow/gold stone set in silver.  The color will go with lots of things.  I looked at a beautiful pair of butterfly earrings of  Mexican Fire opals set in silver.  I asked the price.  The gentleman said ""I'll give you a good deal, you are my first customer.""  I should have run but no, I had to hear it.  $100 he says.  By this time Doc has left me.  I drag him back in, show him the earrings and offer $60.  Oh no, $75.  Doc walks out and I apologize and try to leave.  The man follows us out and down the aisle.  ""Ok, I can give them to you for $65""  Sorry, my bank (Doc) says No.  He followed us all the way down and just before we turned the corner brought the price down to $60.   I didn't get the fire opals.  Sometimes I really hate shopping!

I picked up a cotton, long sleeved jacket with Puerto Vallarta on the sleeves and an ad for Corona Beer on the back.  Years ago I took my little sister to another part of Mexico and we bought similar ones.  I wore it so much I wore it out so I needed a new one.

Last purchase, real vanilla.  Not easy to find in the states, that's all imitation.  Mexico is a place you can get it easily.  I was waiting to find some that wasn't made at home and put in reused bottles (like old pancake syrup bottles).  That is just too scary.  Today I found some that wasn't quite so home made.

Nice lunch, update computer, read.  The 1st of the Final Four basketball games is on TV.  The WVU game is next.  We are planning to stay in tonight to see the game.  We'll either order in or go to the Buffet at half time.

Go WVU!!

Tomorrow is a day at sea.  I signed up for a breast cancer charity 5 k walk.  It's called ""On Deck for the Cure"".  It will be 15 times around the deck.  I don't know how far I'll get but it will be fun.  I have a T-shirt and wrist band to wear.  And I am walking in honor of my sister Karen."

This cruise apparently doesn't stop at Guaymas too often.  Seemed like the entire town turned out to see the ship come in.  We were greeted by a marching band complete with majorettes!  We visited a couple little shops on the pier then spent the day reading, relaxing, eating, etc.  More locals came to watch us leave.  The entrance into the pier is very narrow.  Captain did a great 3 point turn missing all the channel markers, little islands and ships.

We have had such a smooth ride this whole trip.  I am extremely grateful.  But I still take a Dramamine when we are sailing.  I'm not taking any chances.

April 1st
Next stop was the port of Topolobampo.  I have not idea what it looks like because we left in the dark and came back after dark.  It was our Copper Canyon day.  This trip was the major reason Doc booked the cruise.  We were up at 3:00 am.  There was a very nice breakfast waiting for us in the dining room.  We left the ship and boarded very comfortable buses at 4:30 am.  Nearly 2 hours to the train station and I managed to sleep most of the way which is very unusual for me.

We boarded the train for a 6 hour ride up through the mountains.  The seats were not as comfortable as the bus but they weren't bad.  There was plenty of leg room.  Not long after we got settled in we were served coffee and a box breakfast that included yogurt, apple juice, sweet roll, banana, and granola bar!  Wow!

We had a guide on board to point out interesting things along the way and provide the history of the area.  The mountains are lovely.  The time seemed to go pretty fast.

We arrived at the Copper Canyon area and were taken by bus up to a resort for a very nice lunch with views of the canyon.  The Tarahumara Indians are the locals.  The women and children had their wares laid out for us to buy.  They weave beautiful baskets in all shapes and sizes that they sell for very little money.  They are also very shy.  They do not look right at you.  They permitted me to take a picture but looked away as I took it.  I felt so badly I only took one but it turned out nice.

We were then treated to some native dance and shown a couple games that the people play.  it's Holy Week and they celebrate all week long.  In fact, the guide told us we may not see the dance because often the Indians are too drunk to  perform.  He told us they all die young because of the amount of alcohol they drink.  And they make it themselves so it's not as if it was introduced by 'civilization'.

We had 3 choices from there.  A hike along the canyon rim, 250 steps down (and back) to see a native house built in front of a cave, or stay at the hotel.  We chose the third option.  We had a beautiful view of the canyon and also many birds in the bushes.  We say several kinds of humming birds coming to the multiple feeders hung on the balcony.

We boarded buses back to the train station.  The train was not there but there were several bus loads of people wandering around in the sun and dust.  We waited in the nice, cool bus and watched them.  When the train arrived there was a mad dash and crush of bodies trying to board.  We all had a car and seat assignment so there was no need to hurry so we stayed back from the crowd and avoided the crush.

Back on the train and headed home we were given free Margaritas (in very small glasses but who am I to complain?).  Then they came through selling them and other drinks/beer/wine.  We got to see the  view from the opposite side of the trip up and it was much more interesting but unfortunately it got dark before long.  We were once again served a box meal.  This time a big ham and cheese sandwich on a croissant, apple, juice and a Snicker's bar.

Once again the time went by more quickly than expected.  After it got dark, however time started to drag.  Because we were following a passenger train we stopped frequently.  The starts and stops were accompanied by hard jerks.  Not much fun.  The passenger train finally pulled onto a siding so we could pass.  I was so tired and the ride was getting uncomfortable.  We finally arrived at the train station we left from so many hours ago and boarded the nice comfortable buses.  I was once again able to sleep.

We arrived at the ship around 11:15 pm to a surprise.  Many of the officers from the ship were lined up to greet us and we were given champagne to toast our return! They were serving a prime rib dinner with live entertainment.  Doc and I chose to go straight to bed though.  But that was such a pleasant surprise.  There were even people on deck applauding our return.

It was a long, sometimes uncomfortable day.  Some of it was quite beautiful as was the canyon.  I'm so glad we went but would I do it again....no way!"

"event","Yesterday we were anchored off Loretto, Mexico.  We could see the town from our balcony and thus decided to stay on board.  We did a lot of nothing with eating in between.  Loretto is actually a very pretty little place that is green near the shore and surrounded by small, cacti covered mountains.  When the sun set the the mountains made a lovely picture.  

We had reservations on a 'specialty restaurant' on board (read extra charge).  Doc had Steak Diane and I had very yummy lamb chops.  We had a very nice bottle of Merlot from Washington State.  Chocolate souflee topped off a great dinner. 

This morning we pulled up to the dock at Guaymas, Mexico.  The captain really threaded a needle to get port.  It's quite a tight spot and we watched as the ship turned a sharp corner to pull up to the dock.  This port must not see many ships because the dock was full of people watching our arrival.  We were greeted by a marching band, no less!

We could see the whole thing from our balcony and spent most of the day there.  It was warmer than it's been so we didn't have to search for a warm spot.

Before lunch we got off the ship to check out the few shops on the pier.  We didn't bother riding the bus into town.  

At some point during the lazy afternoon I fell asleep and Doc decided to try out the whirlpool tub in the bathroom.  I awoke to hear Doc taking deep breaths through his mouth just outside the bathroom.  He was very disoriented and trying to get to the bed.  He was saying something about the whirlpool that wasn't registering in my mind.  He apparently stayed too long in the whirlpool bath and was very dizzy.  Scared the bejezuz out of me and himself.  He made it to the bed and I brought him a glass of water and ordered him to drink it.  After he lay down for a while his head cleared and he recovered quickly.  Not something either of care to repeat, ever! 

As the time to depart neared the a crowd of locals gathered at the dock to watch us pull out.  It's as if they'd not seen too many cruise ships.  A Mariachi band played and they all waved as we pulled out and continued on our way.

Nice dinner tonight.  Tomorrow we go to the Copper Canyon.  Our day starts with breakfast at 3 am.  Ship docks and we leave by bus around 4:30 am.  The ~ 2 hour bus ride we board a train for a 6 hour ride to the canyon.  You get the picture, it's gonna be a looooong day.  But I'm told it will be worth it.  I'll let you know.

Off to bed."

"event","We are actually docked at Pichilingue (pee-chew-leen-gay).  We have to take a bus into  La Paz.  There are is an open air market set up on the pier.

After breakfast in the dining room I visit the Spa for a Hot Stone Massage, my favorite!  I've been waiting for this since I fell off Johnny.  I'm finally healed enough that it doesn't hurt to touch my back.  When I'm done I feel sort of like a greasy, wet noodle.  Not sure I like the picture that paints!  Suffice it to say that it was great and I was very relaxed.

Doc and I took the bus in to town.  The waterfront has a nice walkway along the water.  The town is small with some restaurants, an ice cream shop and a couple souvenir shops.  There is, of course, a the center of town a Catholic Church.  Doc was not interested in the least.  We walked a couple blocks then went back to the bus.  La Paz is a nice little town.  It is a 'work in progress'.  There is a lot of sprucing up going on and luxury condos are going up.  This place is a desert of rocks and sand with a few shrubs and cacti.  Palm trees are being planted.  The sad future for this quiet little town is civilization.

Back on the ship we have a bite of lunch then read, rest and relax.  The entertainment is a singer tonight but we skipped it and just went straight to dinner.

No drinks before or after dinner.  That's unusual!"

"event","The ship was still moving when we got up this morning.  Not scheduled to arrive until 11 am.  We got to have a leisurely breakfast then stand on deck to watch as we sailed in.  There were dolphins playing in the wake of the ship. They were jumping and flipping and having a great time!  Took lots of pictures coming in but the dolphins were too fast and too far away for my little camera.

There is no pier in Cabo so we anchored off shore and the tenders took people back and forth all day.  Doc and I planned on going ashore after lunch (after the crowd).  We sat by the pool, had a nice lunch, sat by the pool some more, sat on the balcony and eventually lost all desire to go ashore.  It was so nice and warm and quiet on the ship we just couldn't work up the energy to ride a tender in and walk around in the 89 degree heat.  We had a nice breeze and peace and quiet.  Our balcony faced the shore so we watched boats going by and parasailers flying.  We planned on using this cruise for relaxation more than sight seeing and we are doing a lot of relaxing.

I am enjoying this cruise more than any Doc and I have taken before.  This is not a cruise for young people and there are very few on board.  There is no disco, there is a Piano Bar.  At dinner a string quartet plays.  But, at the pool they were playing some pretty contemporary music, very enjoyable.  Speaking of the pool, there are more chairs in the shade than is the sun.  That's opposite from the cruises that cater to a younger crowd who like to sit in the sun.  Us old people gotta be careful.  

Of course, an older crowd means everything is at a slower pace, especially the people.  You have to have patience when going from here to there so you don't trip over the walkers or run over people holding on to the walls and railings and moving at the speed of molasses.

I rarely complain about food and I have none about the food we've had so far.  It has been better than terrific, unfortunately.  If I don't waddle off this ship after 11 days I'll be surprised.

We like the 'late' seating for dinner.  There is always a show in the big theater every night.  On most cruises it's been after dinner.  I usually flake out and want to just head for bed.  Doc is very happy because our show time on this cruise is before dinner.  I have no excuse to miss it. Tonight there was a very entertaining magician/comedian.  I'm wondering if they will have the usual 'Newlywed Game' we always see on cruises.   With this crowd it would be more like (quote from a comedian) the 'Nearly Dead' game.  Oops, did I say that out loud?  

We have tried out a couple of the lounges for our traditional drink before dinner.  I think we've decided the Piano Bar will be the one.  The wonderful string quartet plays in a different lounge just after dinner.  We sat and listened tonight.  The music was beautiful, I could listen all night but they took their break and we headed back to the cabin.  

Tomorrow we'll dock near La Paz.  We may even get off the ship since it will be docked....no tenders."

"event","OK.  I really didn't think I'd have much to say about a cruise.  We sat by the pool, we ate, we sat on the balcony, we ate, we went to the show, we ate......you get the picture.  Turns out there are other things I can say.

We left Pittsburgh a day early in case there was any problem with our flights.  Thankfully the flights were great and on time so we had an afternoon to enjoy the lovely Sheraton Hotel in San Diego.  It was relatively cool so we stayed inside and watched...ready for this???  Basketball!  WVU won, whoo hoo!

On Friday March 26th our bags were picked up from our room and we boarded a bus to the Zandaam, our home for the next 11 nights.  We'd pre-registered online so check in was a breeze.  Somehow we escaped the 'Welcome on Board"" photo.  Since our stateroom was not ready yet we waited in a lounge.  Now, here's the thing.  Doc went all out on this trip and booked us in a suite.  There is a private lounge with our own concierge for all the suite passengers.  There is coffee, juice and always something to munch on in the lounge.  The stateroom is beautiful with a separate sitting area, a whirlpool tub with shower, tons of drawers and 3 (count 'em) closets.  The balcony is huge, as cruise ship balconies go.  There is room for 2 lounge chairs and a table with 4 chairs.  I'm sooooo spoiled!!!

We cruised out of San Diego around 5:30.  The ship rocked a slight bit but I was prepared...can you say Dramamine?

We attended a cocktail party in this lounge (the Neptune Lounge) and met the senior crew including the captain.  Then we went to dinner.  Being the 'love birds' that we are we got a table for 2.  Unfortunately it was right on the highway from the kitchen and the waiters were breezing past us continually.  Service was slow, too.  Doc flagged down one of the officers in the dining room and asked if it would be possible to get a table off the main highway.  The gentleman said he'd do what he could but did not think it would be possible unless we switched from the late to the early seating (not acceptable).  We asked that he do what he could and thank you.

Saturday morning started our first day @ sea.  We went to the buffet for breakfast and coffee.  The buffet is different on this ship.  Passengers do not touch any of the serving utensils.  You move along the line and a crew member dishes up what you want.  Kind of like a school cafeteria with really good food.  This new way of doing things will most likely become the norm in an attempt to keep us all safe from nasty bugs like the Norovirus and the H1N1 flu.  There are hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere and we are encouraged to use them.

After breakfast we stopped in at the Neptune for more coffee.  Kris, our concierge asked if everything was satisfactory with our trip so far.  I mentioned the seating problem.  She said that if we were not given a new table to let her know and she would try.  

We spent the morning trying to find a warm place to sit.  The A/C was set at freezing and it was not much warmer outside.  I was beginning to think I may have packed wrong for this trip.  In the afternoon our balcony was in the sun so we sat out there.

This was a formal night and we found our dinner menu and a boutonniere on the bed.

We got a note under the door that our table change was not possible.  Doc took the note to Kris in the lounge.  About 1/2 hour later we had a new table assignment!  The table is well off the beaten path and the staff seemed to trip over themselves to make sure everything was satisfactory.  The service was still a bit slow but at least we could hear each other so we could carry on a conversation.

Before dinner we stopped at the Piano Bar.  There is a women playing the piano and singing.  Being a small place she welcomed us, asked our names and where we are from.  She told us her theme for the night was Great Women Singers, did I have one I'd like to request?  This is Holland America and the average age of the passengers must be about 70.  I didn't think I'd get very far asking for Annie Lennox or Amy Lee!  So, I requested Sarah Brightman.  Sorry, no can do...ah well, not a surprise.  We went to the show before dinner.  Singing and dancing, ho hum.

Back for the night, the bed was turned down and cute little stingray made from a towel.  Awww."

"event","Well, I got home from Africa on Friday.  Saturday I came down with a nasty stomach ailment.  It was Wednesday until I could eat any real food.  

I went out to visit the boys as soon as I could move.  I can't say they were happy to see me but they did remember me, they went right for my treat pocket.  They were pretty unhappy that I didn't give them any.

Over the weekend I participated in a Parelli Natural Horsemanship Clinic at our barn.  I had a lot of fun and Johnny showed a side I didn't realize was there.  He was his usual bratty self (looking for ways to test my patience) but he entertained everyone else who thought he's such a character.  I don't disagree, it's why I love him, never a dull moment.

On Sunday we were learning to ride with one rein and a carrot stick (long orange stick used as an extension of your arm).  Johnny did his best to ignore me but I won in the end.  I felt safe enough on him to try a canter.  I started out really well, his canter is really easy to ride.  Unfortunately he came up on an obstacle and decided at the last minute to swerve around it.  I wasn't able to swerve with him and ended up on the ground.  As soon as Johnny felt me come off he put on the brakes and stopped immediately. My pride hurt more than anything.  But by the time I got home my ribs hurt, a lot.  My usual remedy of Ibuprofen and beer didn't help much.  I took a hydocodone and my sleeping meds and went to bed early.  Today Ibuprofen is working pretty well.  Doc is being a sweetheart and helping me a lot.  Things like helping me get up out of a chair or doing things for me so I don't have to get up.

I've been in contact with the rescue organization that I foster bottle fed kittens for.  They have their hands full with a lot of kittens.  I brought home a litter of 4 that need socializing.  They were with their mother longer than most and are pretty scared of people.  I plan on spending time with them and convincing them that people are nice to have around.

That should be enough to keep me busy for a while."

"event","What can I say? Knowing me, lots.  

Africa is the trip I've dreamed of for nearly a lifetime.  And in spite of a drought that hid some of its glory I was not disappointed.  It was the most exciting trip I've ever taken.  I watched do many TV programs on Africa and the animals there and felt I knew what I was going to see.  Nothing could prepare me for seeing them up close (a little too close at times).  It's not at all like seeing them in the zoo.  The animals in these parks are not tame but are habituated to people and the vehicles.  That means that they are so use to seeing them that they don't pay any attention to them.  Our guide Tony teased they don't bother with us because they know we are in a 'tin can' and they cannot get to us.  I said, ""Until someone gives them a can opener."" 

I've always had a special interest in the Maasai people.  They are proud, beautiful people trying to continue their traditional ways of life in the face of the decimation of their cattle by drought.  And even though it's a very male dominated society I found them to be very charming and the women happy.

The small group of people we traveled with (3 other couples) made it almost like a private tour.  The other 3 couples knew each other and had traveled together often.  They were so gracious and included us in their group and never made us feel like the odd couple.

Antonio (Tony) our guide is incredible!  He was tough, fun, generous, and extremely knowledgeable.   And he was full of really fun stories gathered over his 35 years of experience.   

Here a few bullet points.

Biggest surprise:   The amount of garbage everywhere along the roads in Kenya.  The plastic bags make it into the parks and are seen caught in trees.  Also that the roads, while bad, were not as bad as I expected.

Most exciting:  Being charged by an elephant, hands down.

Most depressing:  Finding an extremely young, orphaned zebra standing by the road in the Massai Mara.  I'll never forget that baby's pitiful, sad face  and knowing that it would most likely not survive the day.

Most awesome:  The ginormous herds of wildebeest, zebra and cape buffalo in the Massai Mara.  They stretched for miles.  We'd drive through the herds with animals on the road and playing chicken by running across the road in front us.   

So, now starts the job of processing thousands of pictures and hours of video and boiling them down to a manageble size to share with people."

"event","OK, I was wrong about the Tse Tse flies but they aren't as bad as the Serengeti.

We had our last game drive this morning.  We were in a beautiful woodland full of very old trees with very twisted trunks.  It was so nice to see so much green and flowing water!

We saw a new monkey called a blue monkey.  They were in the trees and crossing the road.  We saw a couple families of Baboons.  They had babies with them and one was playing with a plastic bottle :-(  There was quite a bit of mutual grooming going on.  One baby came to it's mother who was getting groomed.  For some reason the mother got angry and bit the baby who started to scream pitifully.  It tried to get on it's mother's back but she pushed him off. He went over to the other one for protection and continued to cry.  Finally it calmed down, went back to Mom and all was forgiven.

We saw only a few Impala, Water buck and Dik Diks.  More baboons, giraffes and elephants.  A young elephant was right next to the road drinking from a stream.  In time the mother came and pushed him out of the way.  He walked into the bushes next to the LC (Land Cruiser).  Mom stopped to scatch and itchy but on a stump and then decided to walk down the middle of the road.  It made me sort of nervous to get in between Mama and baby.  At on point Mama turned to face the other LC as if she was going to get upset.  But she thought better of it and hurried into the woods.

Later on we say a young elephant with a branch in his mouth but still reaching up for acatia leaves.  He came closer and proceeded to scratch his ear and trunk on a tree.

Last we visited another hippo bog.  There was a group of school children there.  I could hear the teacher say something and the children all softly saying ""Aaahhh"".  So cute!

The tree here are so pretty.  We saw large Baobob trees.  They are called the upside down tree because they have a big trunk and then spread out like a root system.  Most look dead because they are deciduous.  They flower then get leaves then shed them for 6 months.  

Later we are taking a nice hot walk to see banana plantations and rice fields. We will also visit a man who carves figures.

Tomorrow we have a loooong ride back to Nairobi.  We will once again stay at the Fairmont Hotel and have a farewll dinner.  This group has been so great.  The other coupls all knew each other and traveled many times together.  They very gratiously included into their group so we never felt like the odd couple.

I'll probably do a wrap up post when I get home because from here out it's mostly traveling.

Thanks for coming along with me.  It's been an incredible experience."

"event","This morning we said goodbye to the Serengeti.  We retraced our road back to Lake Manyara.  This will be our last stop before heading back to Nairobi.  

The roads have not been terrific.  Most dirt and gravel with a nice washboard surface, even the 'main' roads.  We done a lot of long, vibrating rides from one park to the other and today was no exception.  Believe it our not all that bumping can really tire you out. About five hours of bouncing.  We arrived at Lake Manyara Serena Lodge in time for lunch.  All the lodges we've stayed at have been fantastic and this one is no exception.  It even has an infinity pool.  At least here we don't need escorts after darkamd we left the Tse tse flies in the Serengeti.  These flies bit and raise itchy welts but they no longer transmit Sleeping Sickness people but still still make livestock sick.

Believe it or not the group as a whole decided we really needed some 'down' time and decided to forgo the afternoon game drive!  I really hate to miss one but Tony assured us that there is not a lot different here except a kind of monkey that we can see tomorrow morning.

I'd like to spend a minute talking about the differences I've between Kenya and Tanzania.  In Kenya 99% of signs and billboard are in English.  Here in Tanzania it's the opposite, very few English.  Kenyans learn english much earlier than here.

In Kenya the Maasai people dress in mostly red based colors.  They were tons of hand made bead jewelry, even on wrists and ankles.  Tanzanians wear the jewelry but their clothing is red with more purple. In Kenya the people carry whatever they are transporting on their backs with a stap around their forhead.  Here in Tanzania they carry it on their heads.  In Kenya the beast of burden are donkey. Here they also use donkey but I've also seen oxen.

I've learned so much this trip that I'm turning into a walking book of useless information.  I hope to be able to continue, possibly tomorrow.  I may have to finish from home."

You may be wondering what the weather is like in Africa. It's not exactly what you might expect.  In Nairobi, Massai Mara, and Amoselli it starts our cool enough for a light jacket and is the same in the evening.  I dress in layers.  On the morning drives I peel layers as time goes and on the afternoon drive I add.  It never gets really hot and there alway seems to be a breeze.

Ngongoro Serena Lodge is at about 7600 ft and almost chilly.  I wore a heavy coat at times and a fleece pull over other times.  Here in the Serengeti the weather is the same as the others.  It's been a bit overcast so it's really not very hot.

Well, time for out next game drive.  I won't be able to update until we reach our next destination.  That is, if they have decent internet.  If not I'll try to send a text message to Sara to let her know I can't write.

Until next time."

"event","This is a park that I always associate with Africa.  We stopped at the entrance to the park to have a picnic lunch supplied by the hote.  It was huge.  It had water, yogurt, juice, chicken leg, bun, muffin apple, banana and a chocolate bar!!

We walked up a hill and the Serengeti spread out in front of us.  The southern part of the Serengeti is wide open planes that once again were brown instead of there normal green. They are completely flat on both sides with no bushes or trees.  Just a few small gazelle and Impala.  Further on the trees and bushes start to appear althoug the trees are sparse.  We got our first glimpse of a leaopard.  She was totally hidden in the grass I wouldn't have seen her if she'd not got up and moved to another place.

It started to rain  and we started to race to another spot.  There was another leaopard draped over the branch of a tree. Much easier to see.

Now we set out for the hotel.  We were stopped by a huge family of elephants on the road.  There were many babies with them so we don't want to push our luck. I was watching more of them on my side of the road and turned around just in time to see a female elephant challenging our companions up ahead.  She put out her ears and shook her head then just stood there and stared them down.  The top on the LC was down so I was taking video through the windshield.  She finally walked in front of them and started down the my side of the road.  I opened my window and stuck out my camera in time to see her charging us.  Her ears were out and she was shaking her head from side to side!  I only got a short video because our driver wisely took off!  Wow!

We checked in. dropped our bags then went straight to the bar where I had a double gin and tonic.  Since there are no fences permitted in the park our resort is not fenced in and there are loads of dangerous animals around.  We were told in no uncertain terms NOT to go anywhere after 7:30 pm without the escorts they provide.  Tony told us that not so long ago a leopard killed a Dik Dik (small deerlike thing) by the swimming pool.  Walking up the the lounge I was really jumpy and heard noises everywhere.

More about our game drives later."

"event","We crossed the boarder to Tanzania.  In a town called Arusha we had lunch at a beautiful coffe coffee plantation.  Our next stop was Ngongoro Crater.

It is a bowl on top of a moutain.  It is not named correctly.  A crater occures when a volcano blows up leaving a whole at the top.  Ngongoro is a caldera.  When it blew the top collapsed in on itself.

The crater/caldera is a wide open plain that is usually covered in lush green grass.  Now it's very dry.   Our hotel is on the rim.  That meant a long windy climb on a narrow rough road.  Can we say 'car sick'?  I spent a lot of time with my eyes closed.

We reached our hotel and checked in.  Our room has a balcony the looks out over the crater.  When you sit up in bed in the moring you have an incredible view.

For our game drive we went down that windy road.  Dramamine was a help.  Once on the floor we got a flat tire.  No problem the Land Cruiser carries 2 spares.  A lot of people stopped to helf and we were permitted out of the LC.  It was safe, as you can see for miles around.  But it was kind of neat to be standing in a park in Africa!  Usually you are never pemitted out of the vehicle.

We had a nice game drive we managed to see a lioness with a kill.  Ranger told us that lions killed 5 buffalo the day before.  They killed one and the others mobbed them so they had to kill them all.

We saw hippos in a pond.  We also saw a hyena walking toward a lioness.  It was trying to decide if the lion had a kill.  It finally decided it should give the lion a wide berth. 

The next morning 10/31 we moved oun to our next park, the Serengeti.  On the way we stopped at Oldupi Gorge where Louis and Mary Leaky found the effidence of early man.  The world acutally knows the place as Oldovi Gorge but I used the proper name.  Someone asked a Maasai what the place was called and misunderstood him.

I'll move on in the next entry."

"event","We had two game drives in the Serengeti.  Before the morning drive we stopped a the visitor center to learn more about the history and animals.  We were taken on a little walk by a guide who pointed out placards  with various information.  One was in front of a loosely constructed rock wall.  It was alive with these cute little rodents called Rock Hyrax.  They came in and out and sat on top watching us.

Further along our guide pointed into a tree right over the path.  Hanging from a branch was a dead something or other.  It's a leopard kill.  They drag their goodies up into a tree to keep it away from the other animals.  There is apparently a female leopard with cub on the grounds.  Cubs are very vulnerable because they can't climb and mom has to go up the tree to eat.

We left to drive around in the park.  Here there are a few groups of trees and lots of dry land.  We saw a leopard sleeping in a tree.  He was drapped over a branch with feet hanging down.  He/she looked comfy.

Later we got a call on the radio.  All the driver keep in touch (usually) and let others know when something is happening.  We took off at a brisk pace because 4 lions were trying to take down a Cape Buffalo.  By the time we got there they were already eating.  We watched for a while and saw bloody faces and for lack of a better word...guts!  While we are watching that a drama began to unfold on the other side of the road.  There was a rather large herd of buffalo standing at the top of a hill.  Two lions walked toward them then lay in the grass making the buffalo very nervous.  While the other end of the herd calmly grazed and lay down the end near the cats took turns staring down the lions and occationaly charging.  The lions waited patiently.  Tony told us that only 2 lions could not take down a buffalo (it takes at least 4 or 2 big males).  But these were not too concerned.  They were trying to get one to charge far enough away from the herd for one to cut him off and then jump on him.  We watched for a while but it was a Mexican stand off without chance of success. So we moved on.  Was I disappointed we did not witness a kill?  Not in the least.  I don't think I could watch anyway.

Further on there were several lions hanging our just next to the road.  Tony played his 'hyena song' and all came to attention and provided us with great photo ops.

The afternoon drive was not quite as exciting but still interesting.  We visited a bog full of hippos.  They treated us to wallowing, snorting, splashing, grunting and even farting.  It was a memorable sight.  Then we stopped for a line of Safari Ants marching nearly single file across the road.  They remind me of the Leaf Cutter Ants in S. America.  We are told that they bit and if you accidently step in the middle of them they will race up your legs and you will be frantically stripping your clothes off."

"event","Sorry to keep you in suspence but the internet has not been available or it was really bad.

So, I'll tell you about each park.  Amboselli was once a huge lake at the foot of Mt Kilamajaro. Then the mountain (volcano) erupted and covered the lake.  Amboselli has been hit the hardest by the drought.  It's dry to start with.  It looks like a lunar landscape.  But it does have 2 springs that supply abundant water and green grass.  It is very strange to see that flat empty land then look on the other side of the vehicle and see elephants in water up to their belly!  However, the devastation is incredible.  There are carcasses everywhere in various stages of decomposition.  Why were they not picked clean?  Beacuse the buzzards and other 'clean up' animals are so full they cannot eat anymore.  The smell of death was everywhere. But if there is water why are these animals dying?  Most are zebra, wildebeest and some cape buffalo. These animals don't eat the lush green grass.  They eat the tougher grass at ground level. That grass is nearly mon existant.  Also  they think that maybe they are eating sand trying to get the little bits of grass and get blocked.

If an animal has died of natural causes it will lay flat on it's side head on the side.  If it has been killed by a predator it's neck is twisted and head is facing up.  That's because the predator grabs the throat and suffocates them.  Most of the dead animals in Amboselli died of natural causes.  It was awful!  The few surviving wildebeest and zebra were thin, sad looking walking with there heads humg low. Who knows if any will survive if the rains don't come soon.

Please remember them in your prayers."

"event","Ok, I left you hanging. Let's see, where do I start?  Ah yes, the Balloon Safari.

We arrived at the field in the dark just before sunrise.  The basket of the balloon was on it's side and the balloon partially inflated.  The basket has 4 compartments with 3 people in each.  We hop in laying on our back until the balloon rights itself and we rise into the air just as the sun is rising.

We had about a 1 hr flight.  Most of the time we were about tree level so the animals were recognizable and not just moving dots.  It was not scary at all and we saw the animals from a different point of view ;-)

We were told that when we landed the balloon may tip over and we will be on our back again and maybe dragging across the ground.  We got very lucky.  We stayed upright and bounced gently a couple times.  We were taken to a place set up for breakfast and on the way we say our first hyenas and first hippos.  Our breakfast was set up on a slight rise under a big tree with 360 degrees views of the Massai Mara.  We started with champagne. Great breakfast on china plates and real silverware!

Our guide Tony picked us up from there and we joined the others for a game drive.  We went along the Mara River.  If you've ever watched a nature program about Africa you've probably seen the ""Great Migration"" of Wildebeest and Zebra.  They cross the Mara River in great numbers and lose many to drowning and crocodiles.  This is that river.  It is very low because of the drought and has very steep sides.

In the river we saw lots of hippo.  There were 2 dead ones in the water. One was floating feet up.  The crocodiles were trying to eat them but their jaws are made for tearing meat, not biting it.  Their teeth kept sliding off. Tony says the vultures will come and open the carcass then the cocs can feed.

On the afternoon game drive we were searching for Leopards again.  Once again they eluded us.  We started heading out hoping to make it out before 6:30pm.  We came across a couple female lions close to the trail.  Tony played his hyena song and one started searching for the hyena.  She came within a foot of the van and looked up.  The top of the van is open and we are standing up looking at her.  Then she walked around the front of the van to the other side. She and I looked at each other and I couldn't breath.  She could very well have jumped onto the van and we'd really be face to face!  But she turned and went to stand at by the front tire with her back to us.  She stood there for the longest time while I looked down at her.  What a beautiful animal! This shows how use to the vans the animals are.  Our van was nothing to her but something she had to go around.

Now we were really late getting out so we had a 40 mph ride over washboard road with frequent rapid decelerations for ditches and holes.  A wild ride for sure.

This morning we left the Massai Mara.  We stopped at a local school for a tour and then a 1/2hr drive to the airstrip (no way you could call it an airport).  We took a 45 min flight back to Nairobi.  We had lunch at the famous Carnivore Restaurant where they use to serve meat from all different animals. Due to the drought they are conserving animals but I did get to taste Ostrich meatballs and crocodile. I expect the croc to be tough but it was very tender and quite tasty.

The rest of the afternoon was spent driving to our next park, Amboselli.  This park has suffered the most from the drought because it is very dry to start with.  Mt Kimamanjaro takes all the rain leaving Amboselli dry. The word amboselli means dry salty land. We saw clouds in the distance and thought it might be rain.  As we got closer we saw that it was a huge dust storm.  We drove right into it!  It was surreal.  We could barely see ahead or out the side.  When we got through it the landscape which had been very red clay soil looked as if it had been sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Wild!  Tony told us that in his 31 years as a guide he has never seen a dust storm like this.

Our lodge is the Amoselli Serena Lodge.  It is absolutely beautiful as all the places we've stayed.  We all ran for the showers to wash off the dust. After a great dinner I'm headed now for bed. Tomorrow morning we will visit a Maasai village.  I've been fascinated by these people for years and I finally get a chance to meet them in person!  I hope I can sleep."

"event","I apologize. I was wrong about the Big Five.  Throw out the cheetah and add the Leopard.  Yesterday we went out looking for a leopard but they were all hiding. ;-(  Ah well, there's still time. On our first game drive of the morning we found a couple of lion couples.  Seems that when a female is in season the male takes her on a week's romantic vacation.  They mate up to 30 times a day in the beginning but few times as the week goes on.  Females tend to cycle together so all the cubs are born about the same time.  They keep them in a nursery with a couple to watch over them while the others hunt.  The first couple gave us a great demonstration of mating.  The second couple walked across in front of us.  The male stopped between vehicles and posed for pictures then flopped down with his feet on the path!  Just ahead there was a van that was stuck.  I miscalculated a deep ditch and ended up in danger of tipping over.  The passengers were all on the high side of the bus with nervous looking faces.  The lions were too close to get out, besides, it's illegal.  Buses started to group around and one attached a winch to the back end.  All the activity caused the lions to go look for a less busy place to nap.  They took the people out, pulled the van backward and saved the day!

We went back to the first lion couple who once again demonstrated mating in case we missed it the first time.


We got a call that a Black Rhino had been spotted.  They are solitary and greatly endangered.  We arrived in time to see it but he was on the move.  All the vehicles had him surrounded on 3 sides and you could see him getting ready to bolt.  Which he did but not before we got lots of pictures.

Back from the game drive I sat in a shady spot in the middle of a bride.  There were lots of pretty birds in the trees, fish in the pond and lots of singing.  I spotted a young baboon in a tree and he had a Black Faced Vervet mondey with him.  A bit later an adult baboon crossed the path and into the woods.  It's one the management is trying to get rid of because he is dangerous and likes to come into the dining room to help himself.

On the afternoon game drive we saw lots of great things but the best was another group of lions resting in the shade.  Tony (our guide)once again used his hyena tape with great results this time.  One young male actually stood up and took a couple steps toward the other van.  Then as he turned and walked the other way another one came out from under a bush.  As the hyena continued one decided to cross the road in front of us.  The driver rolled up the window on that side in a hurry.  The lion stood on a rock just off the path and looked around for the hyena.  When he came the other way the driver closed his window.  Our van has a top that opens up and I was standing near the front when the lion came back across the road.  He turned and came straight at us!  I thought he was going to jump up on the van.  He changed his mind at the last second but we all needed a change of pants ;0

Today Doc and I and another couple from our group got up for a 5L30am pick up for a Balloon Safari. I'm afraid the details will have to wait as it is almost time for our afternoon game drive.  Our last in the Massi Mara.  Tomorrow we move on the our next lodge."

"event","We left Nairobi Saturday morning and drove 5 1/2 hours to our tented camp in the Massai Mara.  On the way we stopped to look out over the Great Rift Valley. Next we continued down and crossed the valley.  We actually ran into road construction (feels like home).  Once we were off the main highway we were on dirt/gravel roads for the next 3 hours or so.  Along the way we saw zebra and Thompson gazelles in the distance. We also saw wart hogs  and impala (not the car). We reached Saraova Massai tented camp in time for lunch.  Do not let the 'tented camp' fool you.  These are like hotel rooms with wooden floors, bathrooms and canvas walls.  You don't lock your door because it is a zippered entry.

If I told you all the exciting things we saw in just the first game drive Saturday late afternoon this would be a book.  So, I'll try to condense the first two into the most exciting.  Our first game drive was at 4pm.  As soon as we entered the reserve we saw zebra right next to the road.  One had a baby nursing. We saw warthogs and impala equally as close. Wildebeest and cape buffalo were out also. 

We came across about 8 giraffe moving among some small bushes.  They posed nicely for us.  An elephant female with calf were moving away so our driver moved us around to see where they would come out. Unfortunately they remained hidden so we moved on.  A bit later we turned back and watched a large family of elephants cross the trail in front of us.  I cannot describe how incredible it is. They crossed just in front of the vehicle in front of us! 

The find of the day was 3 cheetah brothers laying in the shade.  They were at a bit of a distance but easily caught on Doc's camera with the long lens. 

Tony (our guide) promised that we would see lions and he was true to his word.  There were 2 male lions also in the shade.  They were really sacked out.  One was lying on his back and the most I saw of him was his big paws.  The other was lying on it's side.  Lions and hyena are mortal enemies so Tony has a recording of hyena sounds that he plays real loud to wake up the lions.  The one laying on his side lifted his head looked around with very sleepy eyes and flopped back down.  The other never moved.  Tony continued but neither one moved again.

The very best part of the day, we went back to the cheetahs and there were no other vehicles around.  We got within 15 feet of them.  I was looking right into their eyes!  Tony played his hyena song and all 3 came to full alert making for an awsesome picture opportunity.

This morning our game drive began at 6:30am.  We go early in the morning and late afternoon because the animal are more active.  In the heat of the day they hide in the shade.  First thing we see a very large family of elephant with 2 babies headed up by the huge matriarch.  They walked across the path about 1 jeep length away.  They passed at leisure followed up by a young male.  As we drove away we saw that as they passed another group of vehicles the matriarch stopped and faced the vehicles and stayed there until the whole group passed!

We came across a male and female lion.  When the female is ready her male takes her on a week's romantic vacation away from the pride.  These two were not shy at all.  They showed us quite clearly how mating occurs. Unbelievable!  We moved on to another couple.  These two were on the move and crossed the path in front of us.  The female flopped down about 10 ft away. The male stopped in the path and posed for photos then flopped down with his feet on the path!

We went back to the first pair who gave us yet another example of mating!  

Finally we were lucky enough to find a Black Rhino.  They are solitary and not easy to find.  And so in two days we have been able to see what is know as the Big Five. Elephant, lion, giraffe, rhino and Buffalo.  I might not have that correct but I'll check to be sure.

Oh, I am writing a book! Ah well. one more thing.  Because East Africa is in it's 3 year of a terrible drought there are unfortunately many dead animals.  We asked why they were only partially eaten.  It's because there are so many the vultures cannot eat them all.  So sad.
 
Tomorrow we have a 5:15am pick up for a balloon ride and champagne breakfast!

More later."

"event","We arrived yesterday in Nairobi. In most ways it's like any other large city but when you look around the edges you see the difference. The flora and fauna are not the same. In the city the traffic is bad.  Vehicles travel literally inches from each front to back and not much more side to side.  Busiest intersections are roundabouts with 2-3 lanes.  I try not to look out the front of the mini-van which will be our transportation until the end of the tour.  The 'public' transportation is small mini-vans packed like sardines.  They use to pack in 24 persons but the gov. cut it down to 14 bodies.

We met one couple from the group on our flight out of NYC and the other 2 couples this AM.

This morning we had a city tour.  We went to a shop the tour company obviously trusts to get general idea of what things cost so we can compare while on safari. We will be back at the store at the end of the tour.  There are some really beautiful things I'd love to have and if I don't find it at a better price I'll shop at the end.

Next we went to the Giraffe Center.  We fed a beautiful Rothschild's Giraffe.  I thought getting 'slimmed' by my horses was bad. They've got nothing on Giraffes.  However, because Giraffes eat from a tree with big thorns their saliva had antibiotic properties.  There are 3 different kinds of Giraffe in Africa and Kenya has all three.  They are Rothschild's, Reticulated, and Maasi.  The reticulated are in a part we won't be visiting.

Next we visited the Karen Blixen house (as in Out of Africa).  Very interesting. A good bit of the furniture and paneling are original.  The majority of the rest is from the movie.  The movie only shows scenes from outside the house since the cameras and equipment wouldn't fit inside.

Now we have the afternoon free.  Tomorrow will will travel over terrible roads to the Maasai Mara.  Our guide Anthony (Tony) says that there will always be lots of food because they bounce up for 4-5 hours then feed us to help us recover.  After all, as we were reminded,  this is a safari not a vacation.

We will be traveling in 2 vehicles of 4 persons and the driver.  The other 3 couples are friends.  We are the 'odd' couple and felt bad breaking up the group but one of the couples bit the bullet and joined us.

So, what's happened since July?  We had a cool summer.  Only a few hot days. Easy on the A/C and makes spending time with the horses much more comfy.  But now winter is early.  Until today it's been cold and rainy with some snow flakes mixed in.  Today it's below freezing but will be 50 degrees later.

I've been have loads of fun playing Parelli games with Johnny and Nevada (my horses).  My relationship with Johnny just keeps getting better.  Nevada is catching on quickly and is much more respectful on the ground.  Both are such characters and keep me laughing.  I now have a friend at the barn who also uses Parelli with her horse, Cash.  It's great to have someone else who understands what I'm doing and we help each other out.  We even hosted a Parelli Play Day for our local Parelli group.  We now have a Parelli 3 Star instructor in the area and look forward to putting together a clinic.

Jet, my RBI (very skeptical and easily frightened) went with Melissa on a weekend trail ride up north in PA.  He did really well going anywhere he was pointed including through the river with water up to his knees!  Melissa was 'over the moon'.  I spent an afternoon loading him on and off the trailer. When the time came for him to leave he walked on the trailer like a trooper.

My husband tells everyone he has 'retired'.  I think he's working harder now.  I told him the other day that if this is retirement I want him to go back to work!

Now, the biggest reason I'm reviving my LJ.  We are leaving Wednesday for a 17 day Safari to Kenya and Tanzania, Africa!  LJ gives me more room for updates than Twitter.

So, if anyone is reading I'll let you know (as internet is available) what it's like in Africa.  BTW  we go to NYC tomorrow and leave for Nairobi on Wed.  We won't get there until Thursday.  That's a 13 hours flight to Dubai followed by 5 1/2 more hours to Kenya.  I'm sure it will be more than worth it."

"event","Yesterday was our last diving day. I think I was the only one who really liked it.  The visibility was awful due to a storm the night before.  But once we got down it wasn't too bad.  Just don't wander too far from Bill.  Even though we didn't see anything special I love looking at the ordinary.  Watching fish interact with one another.  We did see two small lobster (about 3-4 inches) sitting together on the top of a big anchor.  They let me get up close and use my magnifying glass to get a good look.  We were over thick sea grass. Watching the fish dart in and out makes me think there is a whole other habitat underneath.  There was a slight current so if I wanted to stop and look at something I had to grab some grass.  But the grass was full of little bristle worms that sting.  Best to look where you put your hand.  

Bill pointed in the distance and I saw a large dark shape. He wrote on his slate ""Bag Fish"". I'm thinking, now that's one I never heard of.  That's because it wasn't a fish, it was a plastic bag!

Glad we're not diving today.  The water at the beach and around the dock was full of jelly fish. Neat to watch but look out!  I think they blew away but I'm not interested in swimming today.

It has been a really great trip.  All our trips here have been great. We stopped to think, this is our 7th stay here.  We are always remembered and welcomed back with open arms.

This was the calmest trip for me.  I usually get anxious at breakfast and don't relax until I hit the water.  This trip I was very calm, not rushed and relaxed even more under the water as well. That makes life so much easier especially underwater because your buoyancy is much easier to manage.  You aren't floating to the surface or bouncing off the bottom (which is sure to elicit a reprimand from Bill). I cannot wait to get back.

BTW, Doc couldn't wait any longer.  He was bursting to tell me.  He has booked a trip to Kenya and Tanzania for October this year!  It seems that everyone (and I mean everyone including Bill the dive shop owner) knew before me!  I suspected he'd booked a trip but we discussed several options including Egypt. I was more that willing to wait 'cause I knew Doc would spill it sooner or later.  Of course, I'm thrilled.

Tomorrow we travel all day finally arriving in Pittsburgh at 11:30 pm. (with any luck). Makes for a really loooong day but it will be good to be home. I've sort of missed sleeping with a cat on my head and under my elbow."

The diving has been fantastic. I bought a magnifying glass from the shop and I'm seeing up close for the first time.  They are new all over again.  It's great!

The past couple days it's just been Doc and I on the dives with Bill (dive shop owner) and Callie (dive master extraordinaire).  Today we saw 4 seahorses, 2 each dive. The first 2 were out moving across the sand.  We all just sorta poke around in the same general area and when one of us finds something we call the others.  Today we found quite a few Leech Headshield Sea Slugs.  I have to look that one up.  They are small, brightly colored slugs :0

As I was poking along I saw a Spotted Trunk Fish http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3238/2739212387_b43420d6be.jpg?v=0  looking at me.  I dropped down close to the sand and it came right over almost close enough to touch! We stared at each other for a bit and another one showed up to look, too.  It was just too cool.  Bill called me away to show me something else or I might still be there watching.

Every day we see new things we've never seen.  When I look them up in the book it most often says they are rare.

Off to bed.  Diving again tomorrow."

"event","Here we are in beautiful St Vincent at the wonderful Young Island Resort.  Getting here was the least stressful yet.  Dealing with Caribbean Airlines could give anyone an ulcer.  However, Liat actually got us here early with ALL our bags.  That is highly unusual but great.

We just love it here.  We have a cottage at the beach.  Walk out onto the back patio and down a step and you are on the beach.  It's a small resort and the beach is pretty small too.  But the cottage is private )surrounded by vegetation. Since we have been here at least 6 times the staff all remember us and we feel so welcome.  It's like coming to our second home.

The island is celebrating Carnival but all the festivities are in town out of sight and earshot from here.  The contestants for the beauty contest were staying her but left after the pageant Friday night.  They were all very good looking girls.  We'd see them at breakfast eating fruit and oatmeal.  Then they'd return in the evening in beautiful dresses and high heals.  I understand Miss Grenada was the winner.

It was sunny the first day but has rained a portion of each day since.  We had thunder and lightning storms both days which we'd not had on any previous trips.  But it didn't cause any problems for us. Except one.

We are here to scuba dive.  We have a package of 5 days diving and we are staying for 11 days.  So, we dive a little, and do nothing on off days but read.  Doc went diving the first day without me.  My ribs were still pretty sore courtesy of my Haflinger Nevada.  The next day Doc had ear problems so I went diving without him.  I was very calm and really enjoyed my dives yesterday.  Today Doc was with me and I started to get uptight before we left the room.  I love my husband dearly but diving with him is a bit of a strain.  I like to follow Bill (the dive shop owner).  He finds all the good stuff.  Doc has a tendency to wander off and I am always trying to keep and eye on him. I've threatened to put a leash on him more than once. Last trip I found the perfect solution, Zanax!  I worry less if Doc is not right next to me but I still keep an eye out for him. And I took one this morning. Today he was much better at staying where I could see him. But Bill was showing me great things and Doc was always too far away to get his attention. But he did show me a couple thing he found.

Yesterday and today Bill found a juvenile trunk fish.  Both were about the size of a pea.  They are dark colored with yellow dots and when they get a bit bigger they look like dice.  Bill handed me his magnifying glass.  Even magnified I couldn't tell which end was which.  But they sure are cute. These were the smallest I'd ever seen.  Luckily Doc was close enough to call over so he got to see it too.

Yesterday we found a baby flying gurnard fish. Please check out the picture of one  http://www.dive-st-vincent-scuba-diving.com/PhotoGallery/2003Mayhew/image003.htm
They are a neat looking fish that can get up to 20 inches long.  This one was the smallest I've ever seen.  It was about the size of a 50 cent piece!  It spread it's wings and looked like a tiny version of the ones we've seen before.

Today when we came up from the first dive (we generally do 2 in the am) it was raining, so we're already wet.  But then came the lightening.  Don't really like being on a metal boat in a lightning storm and I was happy the second dive got canceled.

In spite of the rain we are having a great time."

"event","On Wednesday Erin and I went shopping.  I asked what stores she likes and she said ""Goodwill""!  OK, so her cheap Grandma took her to the large Salvation Army store in Green Garden.  Bonus. There is a Get-Go gas station so I used Giant Eagle points to get a free tank of Premium gas.

Erin found lots of nice clothes.  We went to WalMart on the way home.  We found the last book in a series she's been reading.  I offered to buy her sunglasses and a watch (she loses or breaks them often) but she refused.  Bob came out and we had dinner at the steakhouse up the road.

Yesterday Erin had the choice to spend the morning at the office or come to Meals on Wheels with me.  She chose Meals on Wheels.  She was a big help.  After that we went to the office for a bit.  Melissa joined us for a Chinese Buffet lunch.  After a quiet afternoon we went over to Harry's Place for 'spaghetti night'.  We were stuffed!  

Erin had never seen one of our favorite movies ""Labyrinth"" so we watched it.  A big thunderstorm came through with a nice light show to  accompany the movie.  After the movie Erin and I sat on the sun porch to watch the last of the lightening and the lightening bugs.  She's not seen lightening bugs, apparently they don't have them in Colorado.  I showed her how they make the woods next to the driveway sparkle as if it was full of twinkle lights.

Today we'll most likely go back to the barn.  Hopefully she gets up before noon but I kinda doubt it.

BTW  yesterday was a sad day.  Farrah Fawcett earned her angel wings.  And Michael Jackson?!?!  I never realized he was almost as old as me.  I thought I didn't really like him but as they play his music on TV I realized I liked a lot of it starting in HS with the Jackson Five.  I use to think ""How can he sing all those love songs.  He's only 9 what does he know about love??""

We will miss them both."

"event","Erin joined us on Sunday late afternoon.  After dinner we went out to the barn to visit.  I showed Erin around and we met all the other horses in the barn.

Monday we started with breakfast.  Went to the feed store.  Next we went to the walking track at the park and walked a mile (once around), stopped at the office and hit the grocery store.  On the way back from the grocery store I gave Erin a mini tour of Beaver County starting in Bridgewater where I grew up.  We went through Beaver up into Brighton Twp. and through Bradys Run Park.  Back home we unpacked groceries then rested up for the afternoon.  Doc came home and we were going to go to dinner but he was needed back at the office.  Erin and I took the horse feed we bought earlier out to the barn.

This morning by the time Erin got up we needed to grab a bite for her to eat and leave for the barn in order to meet the farrier.  We got out saddle and bridle while waiting.  Erin got a bit bored watching the 'boys' get their feet done.

That done we saddled up Nevada.  By that time the horses were coming in and Nevada knew dinner was to be served very soon.  So, he was not very happy.

Erin mounted and had the reins but I hooked on a lead rope in case of emergency.  We walked to the outdoor arena and Nevada, although chewing on the bit and vocalizing his protests, was being very good.  After a time or two around the arena I backed off but kept the lead on.  Erin was able to steer and keep him moving at a 'blazing' walk ;-)

Once I felt he wouldn't do anything silly I took off the lead and asked him not to make me regret it.  He had been continuously vocalizing his objection to missing dinner and being the only horse around.  As Erin turned him from the gate, walking toward the center he showed us just how unhappy he was.  He very nicely bent his back legs and lay down!!  Erin jumped off in time to keep her leg from ending up under him.  He got up and Erin jumped back on.  He had to go back to work.  What a little brat!  But you just have to laugh.  I told Erin not to let him stop at all.  He needed to keep moving so that he didn't try that move again.

Aside from laying down Nevada was really good.  He walked at a nice pace and Erin was able to steer him with little difficulty.  Erin rode as if she'd been doing it a lot.  I think she had fun, I sure have fun watching.

Tonight we did go out for dinner.  The weather has been great.  Tomorrow it is suppose to be pretty hot.  Erin and I are going to spend time in the A/C  We are going shopping.  Look out bank book.  We plan on riding again tomorrow but in the evening when it's cooler.

More as the week goes."

"event","My nice quiet boys have been really jumpy and have a lot more 'go' than 'whoa'.  Even Johnny needed no prompting to move forward and at times I had to slow him down-unheard of.  It finally dawned on me that the feed they were getting has a lot of sweet feed and corn.  It should have rung a bell when I was told it was what they feed the race horses.  So I bought some different feed with less sugar and switched them slowly.  Not surprisingly my nice quiet (in some cases lazy) horses are back!  Hoorah!

Melissa came out on Sunday.  She rode Jet and I rode Johnny.  We walked out around a big field.  Jet lowered his head and sighed.  Music to my ears.

Even though all of them are quiet they really learn at different levels.  Walking them to and back from the paddocks I insist that they walk 'with' me not ahead of me.  And I hate it when they yank my arm diving for grass!  As if they'd starve to death before we made it.  So, if they get ahead of me I circle them.  Eventually they get the message, ""if I get our in front I have to do circles and it takes longer to get to where we are going.

As for the 'grass diving' I keep some of the lead rope in my left hand (horse on the right).  If they put their head down I swing the end of the rope around behind me and tap them on the side.  It startles them and they lift their head. I let them stop for grass but only when it's MY idea.   I had to do that a ton of times over several days before Johnny the grass monster got the idea.  He still tries at least once.  He still gets ahead of me and needs many reminders.  It took Nevada just a day but lots of taps.  He got mad and stopped, ran sideways, ran ahead of me or dropped behind me where I couldn't reach him.  But the next time it only took once.   The circling took as many repeats. The first time I tapped Jet he reacted as if he'd been stung.  Head up, eyes wide, jumping away.  But he didn't go for the grass any more.  Once I saw him lower his head but quickly changed his mind.  One circle and Jet did not get ahead of me again.  Fast learner!

In other news, Doc's daughter and granddaughter are coming to Pittsburgh to visit family.  This is the daughter we visited in Denver (last post).  Kathy has to return to Denver on Sunday but Erin will be staying with us for a week.  We'll put her on a plane home on Saturday morning.  Erin is 12 and quite grown up.  We are going to have a lot of fun.  I imagine we will spend a lot of time at the barn.

After Erin leaves we have 4 days to get ready for our diving vacation.  We've done it often enough that packing is pretty easy."

Last weekend we went out to Allenspark, CO to visit Doc's daughter Kathy, Son-in-law Dan and granddaughter Erin (age 12).  Kathy and Dan work at a Christian camp in the mountains just outside Rocky Mountain National Park.  We stayed in the Retreat Center, not a cabin or tent.  Beautiful accommodations and stunning view.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/momevans/pic/0000pdza/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/momevans/pic/0000pdza/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""213"" border='0'/></a>

Kathy and Dan were working on Friday so we had Erin to ourselves.  We had a great breakfast at a tiny restaurant up the road from the camp.  Then we walked the Nature Trail.  It was wonderful.  The altitude, while not  all that high, was enough for me to have problems walking and talking at the same time without getting out of breath.  We took a break to relax and read for a while then took Erin to a pretty, tourist town called Estes Park for 'retail therapy'.

We were going to go out for dinner but when Doc heard the kitchen was making ham and scalloped potatoes it was decided that we'd stay.  

Saturday Kathy was our tour guide up into Rocky Mountain National Park.  More stunning views and snow beside the road as much as 5+ feet cut by snow plows. <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/momevans/pic/0000qxar/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/momevans/pic/0000qxar/s320x240"" width=""287"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
 Later we went to Kathy's house for a short visit.  We followed them to an Italian Buffet restaurant.  Yes, buffet.  Can you say ""Unbelievably stuffed""?  We left them there and checked into our hotel near the airport.  The trip home on Sunday was uneventful.  The weekend was a great balance of family visit, site seeing, and relaxation.

Yesterday I went out to the barn.  I tacked up Nevada for a little ride.  Unfortunately he was so wound up that I didn't even get on.  As the Parellis say ""Does this horse look rideable?""  NO he doesn't!  All 3 of the horses have been much more excitable (yes, even Johnny!) lately.  It's very uncharacteristic of all of them.  Since they are all exhibiting this change I think the sweet feed they are getting might have something to do with it. I was told in the beginning that it's what they feed race horses.  Well, my guys are not racers.  I talked with Hawk about it and he suggested we decrease the feed.  I agreed but the more I think about it the more I want to just change them back to a feed with no sweet feed.  They shouldn't need any grain but I want them to have at least some.  They know the routine too well and know when feeding time is.  It would be upsetting to know all the other horses are being fed and they aren't.  Next week I'll invest in a large, locking trash can and some Purina feed.

It was Team Sorting night and I wanted to see how the boys would react to the cows.  I took Nevada in first.  He was busy being a brat because I was not letting him go anywhere he pleased at any speed.  When I finally got him up near the gate farthest from the cows he stopped.  He smelled them first.  We walked in and he was clearly very interested in the strange smelling, looking beasts.  He was cautious so I let him take his time.  Within 5 minutes he was up to the fence sniffing noses with the beasts. I was so proud of him. 

Johnny reacted as I expected.  Totally the opposite.  I don't think I've ever seen his eyes so large!  He only made it a few steps into the arena.  He stared and sniffed and after a short time felt he needed to leave, in a hurry.  He started to run in circles and I kept stopping him and moving toward the gate.  Once out of the gate he was able to calm a little and I had him stand until he relaxed.  How interesting.

I was nauseous all evening and when I got home I had the shakes and a headache to go with it.  I went to bed early and had a restless night.  Chewie joined me for a while.  He was a purr machine and climbed under the covers. I think he got tired of my tossing and turning and left after a while.  Today I still felt lousy.  I believe it was something I ate rather than a flu bug.  My darling Doc went out this evening and picked up ice cream, chocolate milk and some delightful sorbet that really hit the spot without bothering my stomach, much.  Tomorrow I should be all better. 

And that's the way it is....."

"event","Today I took Johnny out on the trails around the new barn.  Two other horses were with us.  Johnny was pretty worried about everything and spent the entire time looking for the 'horse eating monsters'.  We went by a hay field with a deer lying in the middle of it.  Johnny didn't see it, he was too busy looking in the other direction for the boogey man.  Although he was worried he held it together.  I felt bad for him because he couldn't relax and enjoy the walk like his companions.  He did spook (sideways) a couple times.  The biggest spook?  A clod of dirt came loose from his front foot  and landed on the trail in front of him.  Killer dirt!!!  I tried to stay calm for him but had a hard time relaxing.  Also I'd forgotten that the stirrups were set for my tall, leggy daughter so they were a bit long for me.  It was fine for walking but not as good for trotting.  We were both happy to go back to the barn.  I know it will get better in time but I think he did really well for his first trail ride in several years.  Even then he rarely was out on the trail.

Doc bought grill on Monday and I've actually been cooking dinner!  I've been trying different things and so far everything has tasted really good.  Today I put thick slices of sweet potato on the grill....yummy.  Same goes for the yellow squash and portabella mushrooms.  Tues. I made corn on the cob on the grill.  I'm really having fun and keep thinking of more things to try.  I may even look up some real recipes.

I think the baby bluebirds has flown the coop (nest).  When I went out this morning to put food out for them like every day I was greeted my dive bombing parents.  They followed me all the way to the house diving at my head!  Later I was over by the driveway and they came out of the woods at me.  I got the field glasses to see if I could see babies in the trees but had to give up.  I'd be looking through the glasses and see one of the parents coming straight at me.  At that point the parents going between the box and the woods.  Later I didn't see them at the box at all.  Good luck babies.

Tomorrow we leave for Denver, Colorado to visit Doc's daughter and family.  We are staying at the camp up in mountains where Kathy and Dan work.  It will be great to see them and see how big Erin (granddaughter) has gotten.  She calls us often and sounds so grown up.  

More when we get home, I doubt I'll have any kind of signal up in the mountains."

"event","Talk about dumb.  Please don't laugh too hard. Only I could fall off a horse at the same time I'm getting on!  When I got up on Jet today I threw my let over too far and slid off the other side.  I landed softly in the sand.  No damage done except to my pride. I'm so embarrassed. The worst part?  I'm not sure.  Could it be that there was a competition going on and there were barrel racers everywhere?  Maybe the fact that my husband was watching and I scared him to pieces? I don't think I'll live that down anytime soon ;-(  I've gotten ahead of myself.

This afternoon Melissa came out to visit with Jet.  There was a barrel racing show going on and there were horses and trailers everywhere.  I wanted Mel to be able to ride so she brushed him up as I gathered tack.  We took him out to the outdoor arena since it was not as busy as it usually is.  We used the hackamore (no bit) on him.  He was so much more relaxed with Mel on his back. My DH (Doc) stopped by while she was riding.  Mel is the 'on call' vet assistant this weekend and her phone rang while she was riding.  I got on (sort of) Jet while she dealt with the call.  Doc left shortly after I finally got on.  When Mel finished her call she got back on and attempted to take him out of the arena and walk away from the barn between paddocks.  Jet did NOT want to go that way.  He was done and wanted to go back to the barn.  He started dancing around and tossing his head.  Mel knew she could not give up and allow him to get his way or he'd try that every time.  I'm so proud of her.  She stayed with him until he gave up and went her way.   It was a great ride for both of them.

We brought him back to the barn and untacked him.  He's still pretty shy about the wash stall but we thought we'd give it a try.  Mel walked him in and stood by his head reassuring him.  I was able to hose him off.  I cannot say he was relaxed but he didn't dance around or panic.  He stood still with a worried look on his face (he has such a cute worried look).  Then she took him out to graze.

Once she had him settled back in his stall we went over to the arena, got some lunch and watched some barrel race.  I think Mel had a good time.  

After Mel left I took Nevada to the wash stall and gave him a nice bubble bath.  He handled it the way he has anything I've tried.  He stood quietly and relaxed.  I took him out to munch grass.  I put him back and went back to the arena to watch a friend run the barrels.  I haven't forgotten about Johnny.  I gave him a nice brushing before I left.

All in all a great day."

Baby horses catch colds just like human babies.  I guess I never really thought about it.  Everyone at the barn kept calling it a 'baby cold'.  Technically Nevada is still a baby.  Anyway, he's getting better. 

The Synod Assembly I attended was interesting.  There were a couple of resolutions to debate and vote on.  It was interesting listening to the discussions.  As we were leaving Akron it was raining buckets.  You could hardly see the cars in front of you. There was about an inch of water on the road.  Thankfully it didn't last long.

I think he'd be ready to take a nice trail ride.  He is about as out of shape as I am so it would need to be fairly short but it would still be fun.

Poor Nevada started coughing last week.  It got worse and he got a runny nose. He had no fever and was not missing a meal.  Today he just wasn't himself so I took his temperature.  It was not normal so I called Francene to see how much Penicillin I should give him.  I had to go down to the office to pick up the meds, syringes and needles.  I stopped by home and Doc came with me.  When we got back to the barn I asked BethAnn to help me give him the first injection.  He didn't move a muscle.  It was like he didn't even feel it!  What a good boy.  Earlier I wanted to see how he felt about clippers.  I turned them on and instead of shying away he came over to check them out.  I was able to clip the hairs off his 'chinny chin chin' and I shortened his bridle path.  I didn't even have a halter on him!  Of course the fever may have something to do with good behavior.

Jet is afraid of the horse wash stall.  I've been working with him a little at a time.  The other day he finally walked in, turned around and stood still.  Today he walked in and I sprayed water on his feet a little.  He was pretty calm and I think he trusts me not to get him in trouble.

Johnny is Johnny.  What can I say?  I love him just the way he is.  He makes me laugh.

Tomorrow I will be going to Akron with the Pastor and another member from church.  We are attending a Synod meeting.  I guess it's sort of like a regional business meeting.  It's a day long affair and my ride is picking me up at 6 am!!  Ah well.

The bluebird nest box is jam packed with greyish fluff.  I counted at least 5 babies.  Mom and Dad are kept busy feeding the brood.  I sat for a while with binoculars to watch the parents at work.  I put a meal worm feeder next to the box.  I give them live meal worms, suet and freeze dried meal worms.  They need all the help they can get.  

I'm slowly but surely cleaning out flower beds and planting new flowers.  I moved some iris from one side of the house to the back of the house 2 falls ago.  They were doing nothing where they were.  Last year they grew but no flowers.  This year they are going wild.  They are nearly waist high and flowers all the way down the stems.  They started to open and they are so beautiful.  They are white with dark purple edging.  I'll try to get pics because words just don't do it.

This evening there was a Team Penning practice at the barn. It involves sorting out a bunch of little steers by the numbers they wear and sent them into another pen.  It's just for anyone who wants to try it.  I watched for a while and it really looks like fun.  When the little steer got tired they rounded them up and sent them back to the holding area.  All except one.  He got away and out ran and out smarted at least 20 people on horseback, a cattle dog and one guy on foot.  They had him penned in at one point when he went after the man on foot who had to run and jump up over the fence.  Eventually they got him going in the right direction.  I guess he wasn't as tired as the rest of them.  It was great fun watching it unfold.

Well, that's about it and I need to get to bed.  Very early morning tomorrow."

Warm weather and green grass are finally here.  Winter seemed to last forever!  I put up a bluebird nest box for the first time.  A couple moved in and there are 6 little blue eggs.  How exciting!

After the Parelli Celebration I was so happy to get home and play with my boys.  I bought a saddle for the new boy, Nevada.  It fit except for the fact that he has NO, nadda, zip withers.  The saddle slides around side to side.  So, I bought a non slip pad and that really made a difference.  I rode him today outside.  He paid more attention to the bit this time.  He walked very relaxed and when he did speed up it was easy to bring him back.  He was so calm, I think he's going to be great on trails.  I really need to seriously play with him on the ground.  He's pushy, stomps on feet and will bulldoze me over.  He has a lot to learn but the journey will be fun.

Our local Parelli club had a play date a couple weeks ago but only 3 of us were there. Nice weather, people get busy.  At any rate I played with the host's horse.  It was interesting to play with someone else's horse.  He's so much more sensitive than Johnny.  I was inspired and now Johnny is doing figure 8's and weaving through a line of cones.  He is changing directions in the online circling game.  He was getting bored and I was able to play with him away from the barrel racing practice so I could set up some things to play with.

I started playing more with Jet (RBI).  I have been doing a lot of friendly game and approach & retreat. One day it took us 20 minutes to get out of the barn.  It has a wide concrete aisle and he kept hitting thresholds.  I took the time it took and he is much more relaxed.  I started to teach him the other games and he learned them very quickly.

I'm so happy with the new barn.  The boys get turned out as much as possible.  They are very well taken care of and seem quite happy.  It's further away from the other barn but well worth the extra drive.

Thank you Parelli."

"event","I went out to the barn early (8:30) hoping to get the arena to myself.  I took Nevada out, brushed him up and took him into the arena.  I played with him for a while and he did pretty well.  He a pushy little guy!  He doesn't see to get the message very quickly.  I'll wait him out and we'll be great together.

Next I took Johnny out, stood him in the center aisle while I brushed him and cleaned his hooves.  He stood fairly still but didn't walk away.  I took him into the arena and no-one was there yet.  I turned Johnny loose to let him run.  And boy did he run!  I was waiting for him to turn and look at me so that I could let him stop running.  Before he did that I saw a trainer and horse at the gate wanting to come in.  Now I have to try and catch him before the 'game' is over.  I walked toward him several times and he kept running.  Finally I quietly walked toward him and he turned to look at me.  I walked backward to draw him in and to my astonishment he walked right up to me and I took a hold on his halter and made a fuss over him.  The trainer was pretty impressed and said something to the effect of ""That natural horsemanship really works, I couldn't get any of my horses to do that!""  I was so proud of Johnny!

After Johnny cooled down I put a saddle on him and rode him for a while.  He was very responsive, I rarely had to squeeze with my legs at all.  Wow.

I was going to take Jet out but he was lying so comfortably in his stall.  I went in with him and gave him a good scratch and some treats.  I promised he'd be first the next time I go out.  

I think it just might be a nice, warm weekend.  I'll probably be at the barn."

"event","The day started out with a couple more Savvy Spotlights.  The last was a husband and wife team with two beautiful Paso Finos.  They did a lot of synchronization movements.  The husband got off and his horse followed him all over.  The horse stayed right up next to him as if he was tied to him with a string. They got a well deserved standing ovation.

Next Pat came back with Miss Judge, the TB rescue.  She was so much more calm than the first day.  She was able to stand still and watched Pat with ears forward most of the time.  After some more ground work he saddled her and got on.  She was able to walk around quietly.  Her trot and canter were a bit fast but Pat was in control. Pat gets a standing O also.

After the break Walter Zetl, Dressage Master, talked about the traditional was dressage was taught and ridden when he started out.  It was a lot more like the Parelli methods with the horse in mind not the end result.  It was so refreshing and sad at the same time.  Dressage can be so beautiful when the horse is not forced into the 'proper position' with numerous gadgets.  And to prove it he gave Linda and Remmer a lesson.  Linda started out in Dressage and has been taking lessons 2 x month with Walter for a couple years.  I've seen Dressage lessons before and what Walter was saying was so different.  He used like gently and slowly.  The idea is not to force him but to guide him.  Linda had none of those gadgets on Remmer and he looked absolutely stunning doing the movements.  I could see every subtle change in his gate.  He didn't toss his head or foam from the mouth like I've seen.  When he would change gate without being asked Walter would say ""Don't stop him, go with it"".  At one point Remmer was swapping leads in the middle a movement.  Walter called him a 'Stinker'.  He said that he pushes his students (horse and human) to their limit in order for them to learn.  He had Linda circle Remmer in smaller and smaller circles.  This is the way to get the pirouette later.  Each movement is a base for the next.  I thought this part was going to be slightly boring but boy was I wrong.  It was fascinating!

Pat came back out and told us about some Parelli students who have been winning in various competitions.  One is Jesse Peters who is a certified Parelli Instructor.  Jesse competed in the Mustang Challenge.  Each contestant is given a wild mustang that was never handled.  They are given a number of days (70?) to break and train the horse.  Then they come back and are judged on the job.  Jesse got 3rd place in one part but when he did his Freestyle portion the judges were in awe and he won first place.  

Jesse came out with the Mustang and wowed the crowd.  Truly amazing.  Then Pat told more of the story.  After the competition the horses are auctioned and Jesse's horse brought the highest amount.  The lady who bought him was there.  There's more to the story yet.  Pat introduced one of his crew who had worked with Steve Irwin and when Steve died came to work for Pat.  This man's son was in love with this mustang and came to Pat saying he had $150 could Pat help him get the horse.  Well, when the gavel dropped on the auction the lady with the winning bid gave the horse to this boy.  What a nice story!

The last segment was Lauren Barwick and her horse the winners of a Gold Medal in the Paralympics in Bejing.  She told the story of how a bale of hay fell on her leaving her paralyzed from the hips down and ended her riding career, she thought.  Over time she was able to come back to riding and set a gold for the Olympics.  Truly inspirational.

At the very end of her story LaVerne and I ducked out to beat the rush and get on the road for home.

It was a great weekend.  Good company, great horses, lots of education."

First off were more Savvy Spotlights.  Today they were Free Form (?).  It could be 1 person and multiple horses, I person one horse, several people with horses at the same time.  You get the picture.  They were all great.  One girl brought out 2 horses online and played effortlessly with both at the same time.  It was breathtaking!

Linda brought Remmer and Allure out to show the difference between introvert and extrovert. They entertained the crowd by rolling and running and rolling and chasing each other, etc.  Each rolled at least 5 times!  It was easy to see the difference.  Allure ran around, Remmer went slower.  When Allure rolls it's very energetic, Remmer rolls slowly.  Allure continued even after Remmer had enough and went to stand with Linda. Then she played with each individually to show the different ways to approach each.  It was a very visual demonstration and made the difference very clear.
 
Later Pat brought out two of his horses (Savvylicious and I can't remember the other's name).  He played with both online then got on one and played with both.  It was quite impressive.

At the end Pat brought out a Right Brained Extrovert that was in the Savvy Spotlight yesterday that was giving his owner a lot of trouble.  This horse ran longer on the circling game than I've ever seen. Pat said he needed to learn to stand still. So he had him stand on a tarp and kept walking and talking but every time the horse moved off the tarp Pat put him back.  Time came for the end of the day but Pat was continuing to play and we were welcome to stay and watch.  He worked with that horse for at least an hour and not only could the horse not stay on the tarp but he kept running off.  Finally Pat had a couple of the Savvy team bring out horses.  I thought that might work against him but amazingly it helped him calm down.  I guess he was afraid to be alone.  As soon as he was able to stay on the tarp for more than a few seconds Pat called the game over.

Laverne and I had dinner at the venue and then went to the  big dance.  We sat at a table and listened to the band.  Then we got out on the floor to do the Electric Slide to the song Boot, Scoot and Boogie.  LaVerne stayed for one more dance but I sat back down.  Pat and Linda came out and danced then Pat joined the band to play a (Parelli) horse head shaped guitar.  We left early but had fun.

Ready to turn in.  We check out tomorrow and will be driving home after the session.  I'll post about Day 3 but it might not be until Monday.

"event","What a wonderful Parelli day!  We got really good seats in row 4.  Most of the day we watched Parelli Spotlight performances.  These are Parelli students like us who put together a demonstration set to music to show different levels of Parelli.  It started with Online.  Then at Liberty followed by Freestyle and Finesse.  They were scored on Relationship, Savvy's, Use of time and Space, and Creativity.  Their score is added up and they are given a ribbon that shows what level they are working at.  Red for Level 1, Blue for Level 2, etc.  All of them were amazing.

One girl working at Liberty got high marks for Relationship even though she never took the rope off.  Why?  Because she knew that he was not prepared to go offline.  A young boy (15 yrs old) had a horse that was not able to deal with the noise, crowd, etc. and was very RB.  He chose to get off.  He was so disappointed but was commended for knowing to get off.

A young women rode an Off The Track TB she had rescued from the 'Meat truck' at a racetrack.  He was well worth the save.

Last but not least Pat started a relationship with another TB rescued from 'the truck'.  She comes from the Humane Society and after Pat works with her she will continue her training and found a 'forever home'.  A girl brought her out with a chain over her nose and held really tight.  She acted like you'd expect from a racer, she couldn't stand still.  As soon as Pat put a rope halter and longer lead on her she calmed down.  She is very smart and very quickly she was trying had to do everything Pat asked her.  She was always looking to Pat and asking questions.  I love watching Pat.  It's so effortless for him.  Look forward to the next 2 days.

LaVerne and I had dinner at Outback Steakhouse and now we are relaxing in the lobby reading.  The TV has Wife Swap on and it is outrageous as usual.

"event","For various reasons it's been a while since I've ridden any of my horses.  I was really missing it.  So today when I got to the barn, before I did anything else, I saddled up Johnny and took him into the arena.  As I was leaving the barn Hawk (the man who takes care of the horses) asked me where my bridle was.  He was surprised when I told him I don't need one, I just ride him in the rope halter.  

It was Johnny's first time in the new arena and there were other horses around.  I played Parelli games with Johnny and soon he was more relaxed and tuned in to me.  I got on and we basically walked around so he could check out the place.  There's a lot of new things to look at but he didn't spook at all, just gave them a wide berth and looked at them.  He was so good.  We even trotted a bit.  I'm in a bit better shape than I thought.  I posted like I'd been doing it all along and didn't get out of breath.  My legs held up better than I expected, too.  I cannot wait to do it again.

I leave tomorrow to attend the Parelli Celebration in Harrisburg, PA.  LaVerne from my local Parelli club is coming with me.  It's going to be lots of fun and very educational.  I'm sure I'll have lots of new things to try with Johnny when I get home.

We just may have some warm weather this weekend.  I had a tough time deciding what clothes to pack.  If I pack short sleeve shirts it will be cold.  So I packed both sweaters and light shirts.

Jet did not settle in at the new barn easily.  This morning he did not eat his breakfast and was laying down in the stall when I got there.  His face said ""I don't feel so good"".  I got him up, took his temperature and listened to his belly.  All seemed ok but I was worried.

Nevada was already out so I took Johnny and put him out with him.  They did a bit of squealing and kicking and then settled down to graze.  They did very well together.  Later I took Johnny in.  Jet was still being very quiet but I thought it would do him good to get out.  I took him out and put him in with Nevada. There was  no squealing or kicking.  Jet would graze and Nevada would go graze next to him.  Jet would move to another spot and Nevada followed him. And so it went.  In spite of all the trailers, people and horses all over the place all went very well for a first introduction.  Tomorrow if Jet is feeling better I'll try all 3 together for a while.

Before I left I saw that Jet did not eat dinner either and was laying down again.  When I tried to give him an apple he only nibbled at it.  Should I worry now?  I called Sara to ask if there was anything else I should check and it these were possible signs of something serious.  He was not in pain, no kicking or biting at his belly.  She said it didn't require a vet call yet.

I went home for a while then Doc and I went out to check on him.  He still had not eaten, was laying down again and no manure.  I took him out and walked him a bit.  I took his temp again.  It was normal.  So, I called the vet.  I didn't want to wait until Easter to call on an emergency.  He felt it that considering the new place, new food and new water probably had given him an upset tummy and he should be fine for now.  I should get him out and move around.  I walked and trotted him for a while and he perked up.  When I put him back in his stall he started to nibble at his grain.  I felt much better.  I let him have some of his grain then took it away.  I didn't want his tummy to give more trouble overnight.

On Thursday Doc and I loaded up Johnny and Jet into the trailer and took them to the new barn.  Johnny, the seasoned show horse, gave me a tough time.  He did not want to go in the trailer.  When he finally did get on he was fine.

Jet went right on the trailer on the first try.  He was nervous when he got on but in we took off right away.  They traveled quietly.  Once at the new barn Jet was very eager to get off.  I got him into his stall and went back for Johnny who was now screaming and stomping.  Got him off and into the stall.  We are able to leave the trailer there so that I can work on trailer loading in future.

Jet had more trouble settling in than Johnny.  He was nervous and wild eyed.  I stayed for a while and after a nice dinner he decided that it wasn't so scary after all.

Yesterday it was raining.  I went out to the barn.  It has very wide, concrete aisles.  I took each horse out and gave them a good brushing.  It's so nice and bright.  In the other barn it was alway dark.  There was a girl there on a stepladder cleaning the big fluorescent lights in the barn.  Wow!

Today there is a barrel racing competition so I won't be able to take them out.  So, it's ""tail day"".  I've not had a chance to brush out their tails for a while.  So, I'll do it today.

"event","My new Haflinger Nevada has settled in at the new barn and we are bonding.  I've been going out and walking in the pasture with him.  He runs to the gate when he sees me coming.  He follows me all around even up and down the bank.  I guess he's trying to figure out what in the heck I'm doing.  I'm exercising Darling.

I take him out and we explore different different parts of the grounds, eating grass on the way (at least Nevada does).  At first he was pretty nervous but he's calmed down a lot.  I've played some Parelli games with him.  His former owner used Clinton Anderson training with him which is very similar.  As a result he knows a lot of the games.  He gets bored very quickly so I have to move on to something else often.  He picks up new things quickly. 

Today I had a vet come out to check him over.  I thought that it would be best to be a client of the closest vet to the barn.  And this check up is a good way to meet the vet instead in an emergency situation.  Nevada checked out ""no problems"" as hoped.  He still had wolf teeth (kinda like baby teeth that make the bit uncomfortable) so I got he vet to pull them.  He gave Nevada sedation.  I've seen horses sedated before.  They hang their head and walk unsteadily.  Apparently Haflinger's are 'cheap drunks (vet's words).  Poor Nevada was really wasted!  He leaned way back and I thought he was going to sit on his butt.  Then he leaned sideways and I was sure he was going to fall.  I was a bit concerned but Dr. R was unconcerned.  He pulled the two tiny teeth.  On the second one I noticed there was some blood.  Not worried.  When he finished Nevada hung his head and blood started pouring out.  Now, I have to admit, I was a bit worried, but Dr R seemed OK with it so I didn't panic.  He explained that when Nevada moved his head suddenly the instrument he was using slipped off the tooth and nicked the roof of the mouth.  I could tell he felt bad, not a good way to impress a new client.  But I know that stuff happens and I don't hold it against him.  I think he appreciated that I didn't freak out or worse yet, pass out.  Nevada continued to bleed while he finished up and we talked vaccinations and such.  Dr. R assured me that it would stop but could bleed some as long as 24 hours and the nick didn't need stitches.  I really like this guy.  He's very knowledgeable, personable and explained things.  I didn't feel like he rushed a bit.  Guess I'm just use to human doctors.

I put Nevada back in his stall.  The medicine wore off before the Dr and I finished up.  I put a few things away and spent a bit more time to make sure he was ok.  Thankfully he had pretty much stopped bleeding.  I left a note so that the barn help don't come in in the morning, see the blood and call the vet.  Once I was convinced he was ok I gave him some treats and left.  I was exhausted!  I'd been there all afternoon playing with Nevada.  I did a lot of walking and I'm feeling it now.

Tomorrow a local Parelli instructor is coming to help me with Johnny.  I'm not really having trouble but I've been doing this all on my own.  It will be great to get feedback from someone trained in Parelli.  

These cold mornings have got to go!! Even the afternoon, in spite of the glorious sun, the cold breeze keeps it from feeling all that warm.  I'm so done with being cold"

"event","A change is coming and it's exciting.  The weather is finally getting warmer.  My flowers are coming up and the crocus are blooming.  The birds are singing up a storm.  I love Spring.

I'm moving the horses to a beautiful boarding facility.  It has a huge, heated indoor arena, large beautiful stalls, lots of turnout and tons of trails.  Its further away and not on the way home from anywhere but well worth the drive.

And the best thing...meet the newest member of the family, Nevada.

"event","I found out yesterday that the barn manager where I board the boys is leaving in May.  I understand completely why she is leaving. There a some problems that need to be addressed.  They just aren't being done.  I don't want to be more specific.   But she takes very good care of my boys and I worry who will take it over.  While the barn is not fancy it is on my way home from just about anywhere I go and it's really close to my house.

I talked with the manager today and the place she is going has stalls available and the board is reasonable.  I'm going to check it out soon.  It's further away but not a great distance (about 11 miles away).  I could also go back to my first barn.  I only left there because this one was just too convenient.  After I see the other one I'll make a decision.

I finally was able to spend some time with the horses today.  I turned them loose in the indoor arena and boy did they have a great time running, bucking, farting, rolling and kicking up!  I just love watching them!  The farrier came and I held Johnny while he got his feet done.  I love Johnny to pieces but he can make me soooo mad.  He doesn't give the farrier a hard time by moving around or kicking.  He pulls out all the stops to get on my nerves.  Like a huge 2 year old with ADDHD his head is in continuous motion.  Head goes down to eat hay from the floor, sticks his nose into the nearby stalls to visit and trying every trick to nip me, chews on the lead rope, tries to nip me, nods his head, back to the floor, try to nip me.  I think you get the idea.  He only does this stuff when he knows I have limited options to stop him while he's getting his feet done.  I start out laughing but he is so relentless that I'm thinking dog food by the time he's done!

Melissa came in time to hold Jet for his trim.  Jet is an angel.  He stands quietly and lets Melissa scratch him as he nearly falls asleep.  I brought Johnny over and told him to watch how Jet does it and LEARN SOMETHING!! <giggle>

While loose in the arena a first happened.  As I stood chatting with Melissa and ignoring Johnny he walked up to me and looked at me as if to say ""Well, you put the play halter on me when are we going to play.""  Johnny never pays any attention to me.  Sometimes if I'm walking to him he'll meet me half way but he never comes over on his own.  Wow!  We played Parelli games for quite a while and we seemed to be on the same page.  Melissa tacked up Jet and rode him.  He was such a good boy.

Got home in time for a short rest and then shower and off to dinner with friends.  All in all it was a great day.

I'm starting to feel human again.  Still need to build up my stamina.  I get worn out really quickly but I'm going in the right direction."

"event","Well, I didn't feel much better this morning so I called the doctor's office for an appointment.  I was able to get the last open slot of the day but I only had 45 minutes to get dressed and drive drive about 1/2 hour drive.  I made it in time.

The doctor decided that I have a sinus infection and bronchitis.  He ordered an antibiotic and an Albuteral inhaler.  I could hear one of the office ladies walking him through what sounded like a computer program.  Must be new. I heard her say ""There, now it's in your Favorites""   He stepped in the door holding a device about the size of my iPhone but a bit thicker.  With a little help he found my pharmacy and order the meds.  No phone calls, no Rx papers.  I said that once he got the hang of it that he'll be really glad to have it.  He'll be able to easily fine meds that he uses frequently then add it to my profile and send it to the Pharmacy.  Cool.  I said that once he got the hang of it he'll be glad to have it.  He agreed but the learning process is apparently stressful for him.

I made a quick stop at Michael's (craft store) and by the time I got to Giant Eagle pharmacy my Rx's were ready.  No waiting necessary.  I found out something about our new Health insurance co-pay.  With the old plan the co-pay was $20 for any Rx that cost more than that.  This one isn't the same.  The antibiotic cost $40.99 and the co-pay $15.  The inhaler cost $54.99 and the co-pay...$50!  Go figure that logic.  I'm going to have to look into this to find out the formula.

Time will tell if I'll finally start to feel better.  I'm really ready for this to be GONE."

I just looked at him he goes why are you givin me that go to hell look I said cuz you can go there. He goes do you have ne black panties. I said you REALLy need to SHUT-UP now!! THen he went to sleep. OMG. But its ok cuz today I found out this really sweet, christian guy likes me, so I don't only attract nasty perves. There are some good guys that think I'm pretty too. But I hate to say it I don't like this good guy. I don't know why I just don't. Well neways I saw Eddie today. Eddies the guy I told ya'll I liked and he just wanted to be friends. I saw him.

"event","I know I've already wrote in this thing like 2 times today but O well. I like almost passed out during dinner. It was weird. I couldn't see and like I felt sick, somethings wrong with me. I think its psychological though. I feel so stressed out for some reason. Steven told me I've been pissy. But the world of men is So confusing. Today at the store my mom said some guy was following me around and he was like 30. Ok I said this last time but what is it about me that draws perves. I mean what about me makes a 30 year old guy think he has a chance at all. Where in the heck does this fagget get off telling me I should be in a porn movie b/c im so f---in sexy. Ppl wouldn't tell Bre that, what is it about me that makes them think they can tell me this crap. I mean ppl tell Bre she's gorgeous, beautiful, all this stuff and she totally, super is. But y ain't I, y am I f--in sexy, Y? What do I do?BUt ya know I'm SOOO sexy rite. Yeah okay so thats y guys don't like me. Ya know cuz the good guy at my school that I like well he thinks I'm funny, and cool but we should just be friends. YOu know y? Well I think its cuz he has a bunch of girls that wanna have sex with him. Whatever. I don't care. i just wish i meant something to somebody, i wish someone cared that wasn't only after my booty the little I have (sry Ace) But like I said whatever. Then I kinda like this guy that I met Wed he's cute and really funny but I think he likes Court. And Anthony likes Court, and Everyone likes Court, or Bre, or Amanda. Y don't guys like me, whats wrong with me??????? ONe more time I'll say whatever. I gtg now I'm goin to sleep. Bye ppl"

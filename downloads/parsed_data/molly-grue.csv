The Atomic Submarine---'50's era about something attacking ships from the North Pole, so the Navy sends out a submarine to find out what's going on. An alien is the precursor of an invasion, so it must die.  Notable mainly because the submarine is based out of Bremerton. KILL

12 Years A Slave--The story of a black freeman in 1811 who is captured and sold down south. He tries to survive until eventually he was freed. It deserved its Oscar, but I don't need to see it again as it is very disturbing. Surprise actor Benedict Cumberbatch. KILL

Now I get to go in the other direction! Yay!

Now watching African Safari which is someone's travelogue from the '80's. Interesting, but it must die. KILL"

It! The Terror Beyond Space (1958) was actually about a terror from Mars that got stuck on a rocket's return journey. And it took place in 1973!! KILL

Horror Hotel--A young grad student is lured to a remote New England village trying to get original sources for her paper on the burning of Elizabeth Sewell. (This would indeed be a coup if she found some, as no witches were actually burned in the US.) I can't remember what happens next as I fell asleep. Surprise actor Christopher Lee is not enough to save this one. KILL

And of course while I'm typing this, I remember that I saw A Nous La Liberte, a French comic film reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. Two prisoners try to escape jail, but only one makes it. He manages to become a successful record player maker. All is well until his friend is released & goes to him for a job. I particularly enjoy the fact that the factory floor is almost exactly like the work area of the jail.  KEEP

Bad special effects, actors that didn't want to show up today, scenes that were chopped short or deleted altogether (yes, you could tell), together with unlikely happenings (besides the title character).

"event","C and I were talking about doing some sort of marathon for the last week; Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Star Trek, etc. We finally settled on The Young Ones and Bottom.

After a couple of days, we were kind of bottomed out (yes that was intentional) so we switched. 

Because we have a lot of movies piling up on one of my drives, it was decided to have a reverse-alphabetic marathon seeing one movie starting with each letter. That way we get a choice of what to see, and we can decide on keeping it or killing it.

So far, we've seen (or I've seen by myself):

Zombie Hunter (2013)-- This movie spent all it budget on hiring Danny Trejo. And then keeping his screen time to 10 minutes. KILL

Something that started with ""Y"". I don't remember what it was, but it died.

X-The Man With the X-ray Eyes (1963)-- I have taken the opinion that I repressed the memory of seeing this film. That was a good thing. KILL

Wild (2014)-- The heroine is trying to work through the death of her mother (or stop using heroin) by walking the Pacific Coast Trail. More of a vision quest kind of movie. While good, I don't particularly need to see it again. KILL

Vampire Vs. Vampire-- A chinese martial-arts movie made in the mid-1980's featuring hopping vampires. A good comic movie, but one that we decided to wait on until C gets his glasses.

The Unearthly (1957)-- A mad scientist uses his patients at a remote psychiatric facility to research and create longevity by surgically altering his patients. Oddly, this does not go well. No sign of aliens, ghosts or anything that could be described as ""unearthly"". KILL

Something that started with ""T"" that I can't remember. That was probably a blessing.

Shrek: The Musical (2013)-- I did not think that there was such a thing as too many musical numbers in a musical. Color me corrected. KILL

Raise the Titanic (1980)-- Someone discovers that Titanic had some Unobtanium on board when it sank. IT MUST BE FOUND!! The Russians are after it, the Americans MUST have it. I could have sworn that Surprise Actor Sir Alec Guinness showed up at one point, but IMDB says no. IMDB is flawed. KILL"

"event","Well, another convention has come and gone. I had a fantastic time with this one. :-)

Jon Davey was fantastic. I bought him a weeping angel drink and hung out with him for two hours on Thursday night while we talked about film and television and his trip to New Zealand. He had been to the Hobbiton set up and showed me pictures of his time there. I was amused that he had taken a lot of selfies and had a few pictures of him and another celebrity where he was smiling and pointing at them like he was amazed he had met the guy. Very enthusiastic person.

The next day I had wanted to set up the video room early (did I mention that I was in charge of the video room? :-) ), but it turned out that KBTC wanted to use it to have interviews with the guests. Darn. So I hung out in Hospitality which was next door where I helped set up a little and had fun hanging out with Katie Manning, Sophie Aldred and Jon Davey again. Katie Manning hugged me (as it turns out she does practically anyone) and I told off Jon Davey for not having updated his IMDB page. This is where I learned that updating it was just as confusing to him as he had about four different pages. Also that IMDB was set up by the same people that set up Wikipedia. Who knew? Probably everyone except me. 

Sophie Aldred was a bit reserved throughout the convention. She might have thought I was stalking her a bit because I kept running into her (I wasn't). I always got a bit tongue-tied because I didn't want to fangirl all over her or ask all the usual questions, especially since I knew she would be having interviews all during convention. Ack! Even though she had done quite a bit of voice-over work, she has recently hired a screen agent to get back to acting on screen now that her kids were older. I hope that leaves more video that I can show eventually. During one of her interviews she mentioned her movie The Search for Simon and it turned out I was the only one who had seen it....in a fairly large audience. :-)  Good movie though. Reminded me a lot of Love and Monsters; without the Absorboloft. Did I mention that she snuck into the Onions & Roses at the end of convention? She had mostly positive feedback and only really complained that the guests should have been served coffee at the beginning of the banquet on Sunday.

Did I mention I was in control over the Video Room? ;-) I thought it was awesome, although I now have ideas on how to improve it. I think for longer multi-part series (like practically everything in UK television) over a few nights, instead of all at once. That might free up some time to have a bit more diversity and draw people in on nights (like Friday) when they wouldn't go because Hospitality, Gaming and the Craft Room had closed earlier than I had. I get a lot a traffic of people going to one or the other and hearing interesting dialogue or the the opening titles of Doctor Who and stopping in to see what is going on. However I did hear one complaint; the room wasn't big enough!! That means I was successful!! Yay!!  

I really disliked that I:

1) Hadn't re-set up the VLC playlist and then had to do it manually meaning that the Video Room was always late.
2) I overslept on Sunday and was extremely late to the point where ConCom called me to make sure I wasn't dead.
3) I was almost sleeping on my feet on Sunday so didn't go to the Dead K-9 dance....which I really shouldn't have gone to anyway because I was almost falling asleep at the wheel on the way home. I took Chris out to dinner and ended up telling him I wasn't sure I should be driving because of the same issues.
4) Wound up using my computer to power the Video Room because no-one else has the good sense to use an Apple computer.
5) Cashed out my credit cards for this. I will be trying to clear at least one for next year.
6) Missed most of Chris' birthday because I was staff at convention.
7) Forgot to put the computer's power cord on because it was Sunday, I was running late and I wanted to go to a panel.
8) Missed most of the Best British Television Shows You Aren't Watching because of the emergency in the Video Room. (I have to remember to email Ryan to get a copy of the handout)
9) Forgot to turn my screensaver off so the volunteers had to remember to touch the touchpad every so often to get the video back.
10) Need to learn about VLC a bit more. 

Overall a good convention! I loved the panels I went to, Colin Baker was entertaining as were all the guests. I got a Solar-powered Queen at the Charity Auction. :-) You stick her in the window and she then waves happily. I love it. And I got my membership for next year! I'm so excited!!"

"event","Many, many years ago the first convention was a Norwescon. I think it was the last time it was at the Red Lion (same hotel different chain). I know it was the one that had both Neil Gaiman and Brian & Wendy Froud. It was a good convention; there were many panels that I do not really remember, a dealer's room, I got Neil Gaiman's autograph, and Robin had introduced us to Neverwhere which she had taped off of KBTC. 

One of the things I was kind of looking forward to was the video room as Chris had told me of hanging out in the video room when there wasn't anything else to do (there is a specific story to go with that, but not now). However, this was the year Norwescon was able to afford the hotel channels, so there wasn't a video room: instead if you wanted to see what was normally in the video room, you could just switch on the tv in your room and watch convention programming where no-one would think you are a loser.

Of course, you don't really stay in your hotel room during the day; instead, the appeal (for me) is to see what is on really really late at night (or very early on in the morning) which is when all the interesting stuff is on anyway. Mostly I remember seemingly endless repeats of Neverwhere, but other conventions introduced me to shows I never would have seen or been exposed to on my own. Like Bubblegum Crisis, Teletubbies, The Adam & Joe Show, Stressed Eric and others.

I like to think that weird stuff should show up in the video room (or the video channels) to inspire others to reach out of their comfort zone like Chocky or The Harry Hill Show. I know that this is mainly going to be a Doctor Who convention, but I think in my plan for the video programming is going to de-emphasize Doctor Who in favor of weird shows like Clone with Mark Gatiss, fanvids of not only Doctor Who but also Harry Potter, and fan films like Doctor Puppet. I love that there is sooooooo much more out there that I can't possibly try to cram it into three days, that there is such raw creativity that can be featured and created. 

I hate that I have until the end of February to get my list sorted, ordered & set so it can go into the programming guide. And I don't like having my programming set by others. I have a few requests that I can put in.....but it is starting to bog me down. I have a feeling that one of the Three Who Rule will show up and criticize what I did with the video programming on RFS, thus letting the entire world of Fandom know I failed. What if I don't include *enough* Doctor Who?  There's only so much time!!

For now, I may just have to include the first few episodes of shows like Sapphire & Steel. You can get away with a few episodes of something like Blake's 7; but S&S may be a different story. Perhaps a note in the program book directing people to YouTube or DVDs?

Everything will be ok. Everything Will Be OK. Need to keep repeating this to myself. Everything will be ok. And I'll be more prepared for next year. :-)"

"event","Moffat has implied that the Doctor has more than 12 regenerations. That the fanbase has ""missed something."" So here are my theories:

1)Mawdryn Undead. Fifth Doctor came across a machine that would take his remaining regenerations and help some practically immortal mutants to die (they actually want this). For some odd reason, the Doctor refuses, but eventually agrees. The machine is destroyed while the Doctor is hooked up to it, causing the potential for additional regenerations.

2)The Parting of the Ways. Rose absorbs all the energy of the TARDIS to save the Ninth Doctor. In return, the Doctor transfers the energy into him (by kissing her) and then puts it back into the TARDIS. However, that energy is very similar to regenerative energy; thus possibly getting more regenerations. After all, the TARDIS loves her Doctor!

3)The End of Time Part 1. The Master is burning up his life energy after a failed resurrection/regeneration when he decides to shoot Tenth Doctor full-on in the chest. Enough to give him more regenerations? Only time will tell.

4)Let's Kill Hitler. Melody Williams regenerates into River Song and after poisoning the Eleventh Doctor, decides to heal him by giving him her remaining regenerations. Although we know that River didn't have a full set of regenerations left (she was on her third or fourth at least by the time she did this) that would still give the Doctor a couple he didn't have before.

At any rate, Peter Capaldi is the Twelfth Doctor (assuming William Hartnell was the original incarnation) so he should have at least one more actor before they <i>have</i> to give him more regenerations somehow."

"event","The Doctor values his freedom above all other things. He wants the freedom to do what he wants and go where he wants without any ties. The only thing that is more important to him is Susan. He will allow her wishes; so long as they don't interfere with his freedom too much. Susan wants to go to school in the mid-twentieth century (for some reason--although I think it has more to do with socialization with people her own perceived age). Yes the Doctor values knowledge, but mainly so it will preserve his freedom.

In An Unearthly Child, the Doctor is mainly resentful of how Ian and Barbara force their way into his life and I think that in The Cave of Skulls he fully intended to leave them behind with the cavemen; except Susan apparently had somewhat bonded with them. I don't really doubt that he would have used the rock to kill Za, thus ending any tie or perceived obligation he would have to the cavemen that would interfere with his freedom. The fact that Ian and Barbara helped to show him a better way to deal with the situation did set him on a different path; one where he would help people instead of ignoring how he interferes with them while ""observing"" them. Maybe he would have eventually stopped traveling and taken up his proper place in Time Lord society after his ""rebellion phase"" had ended and he had seen enough of the galaxy. Who knows?

However, in the Daleks, the Doctor practically goes on a killing spree, killing Daleks left and right in order to escape; to get his freedom back. But now, he won't leave anyone behind; he starts to feel a responsibility toward Ian and Barbara. Not necessarily to get them home, but to keep them out of harm's way. I think he still feels like they are cumbersome, but they are people he can start to talk to and interact with on a different level than Susan. 

Yet he still wants his freedom, he wants it enough to sabotage the TARDIS so he has the freedom to explore the strange Dalek city, hopefully to his hearts content. Of course the Daleks interfere with that, and are a very interesting rival to the Doctor. At this point in the Doctor's life (very early) they are almost on the same level with him as far as cunning and power. They are just more willing to use it. 

The main seeds of the character are all there: the need for freedom to wander where he chooses, the willingness to help and extend the hand of friendship, as well as the darker side that will surface more and more as he gets older.

As far as the individual shows go, I love An Unearthly Child. I do hate the way that the camera is practically shoved up Carol Ann Ford's nose during the flashback scenes. And the Doctor is obviously going to leave in the TARDIS if he convinces Ian and Barbara to go to the police and leave him alone. However, I can't <i>really</i> be sure that the Doctor was going to leave them behind in the Stone Age, yet I wouldn't put it past him as that would be a perfect way to get rid of them and stop them from telling anyone about his technology.  

I also like the Thals and the mens artfully ripped pants. Perfect Aryans that they are, it doesn't go to badly on the eyes. The other costumes.... well, it was the '60's. I'll probably say that more as time goes on. The Daleks are lovely and I notice that the ""speaking lights"" are not always in synch with the actor or seem more of an afterthought. When Ian is operating the Dalek, I can't help but laugh, it is so funny. Ian refuses to speak in a monotone and tends to act ""normally"" which is a distinct tell to the other Daleks.

The books are... not really what I thought they would be. I had hoped that An Unearthly Child would shed some more light on the whole rock incident, but it did not. Doctor Who and the Daleks felt some sort of odd need to re-invent how Ian, Barbara, Susan and the Doctor meet and then they go straight to Skaro. Radiation sickness does not get mentioned, instead they are suffering from some kind of ""air pollution"". It's also told from Ian's point of view.

On the whole, having fun."

"event","I'm trying to get back in the headspace of writing these...so here goes!

The Christmas season was a bit hectic for me; more having to do with running around than anything specific. I think it's been a two-week period where there almost hasn't been a day where I've had to go from sleeping to running full-tilt in half an hour just to get where I'm going. Especially what has euphemistically in the past been called ""days off.""  Here is one of the drawbacks of writing for a semi-public forum: I know that there are those among my friends list who see the last sentence and think ""I've been just as busy for the last days/weeks/months/whatever"". Well, my life, my problems, my journal. Have to always remind myself to turn off the internal editor.

Looking back over the year, I see interesting things. I knew I wasn't going to reach my book goal, I lost count of my movie goal, and I don't think I even scratched the surface of my cleaning goal. Go me! I do see some fascinating trends though. I almost got halfway to my stated book goal, and I understand why I stopped counting movies. I stopped counting because it is boring and I didn't get to my goal because I would have needed a 36-hour day to complete that. I refuse to put any pressure or guilt on myself for that 
 (since I knew I wouldn't get there in the first place); instead, I am going to congratulate myself on what I was able to accomplish, and set something more realistic for 2013.

Right now, I'm looking ahead to 2013 and thinking about what I want to accomplish as far as personal goals. Currently, I am planning on watching all of Doctor Who, starting with William Hartnell the original  in January and continuing on with other Doctors concluding with Matt Smith (the current Doctor) in November. April will be exciting as I attempt to watch seven years' worth of Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor) in one month, but August will definitely be a ""make-up"" (or maybe ""Revlon"" or something....) month as I'll only have the TV Movie to watch (sole appearance of the Eighth Doctor Paul McGann). I want to try to read some of my supporting Doctor Who books as well, so I'll be reading the <i>Tardis Eruditorum</i> while sitting with my <i>Discontinuity Guide</i>, the <i>About Time</i> guides and possibly <i>A History</i>. Expect to see the Target novelizations also appearing on my Goodreads page as well. Will I fan all over this journal? What else is it for! Hopefully I will be able to stay sane by still following a couple of book clubs with non-Doctor Who-related reading. 

I think that as far as fandoms go, I am majoring in Doctor Who while minoring in H.P. Lovecraft. Odd combination, but one that gets closer in time. I mean, Oods for heavens sake!! If those aren't semi-Cthuthlhuian I'll eat fruitcake.

The common theme in all of my goals lately is that I want to have goals for the sake of having them; having goals be something to reach and stretch for, but not to completely hurt or stress myself to get to them, as well as not to kill myself if I didn't reach them. Did I accomplish <i>exactly</i> what I said I stated, or did I accomplish what I wanted? There is a difference. I just hope I manage to accomplish what I feel I need to do."

Your favourite character (non Doctor Who): 

I have to admit that I Love love love Michael Crawford's character Frank Spencer in <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069634/>Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em</a>. Sure the it's just one prat fall after another, and if I met this guy in real like I probably couldn't stand him, but every time I watch one of these episodes, I laugh myself sick.

Your favourite show:

Here is a secret: I actually do love <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075511/>The Good Neighbors</a> (aka The Good Life) more than Doctor Who. I have a horrible suspicion that I behave more like Margo when I'd rather be Barbara. I wish more than most anything else that I could live their life, be financially independent and be able to say ""Fuck Off"" and be able to live off of the grid the way that they do; but I am too lazy for that."

I'd have to say Leela. She could kick just about everyone's ass, including the Doctor's. Smarter than she seemed and true to her original world-view. I hate it when Tom Baker belittles her and calls her 'savage' or makes fun of how little of science and math she knew. Leela protected the Doctor on more than one occasion when things turned rough and was an excellent person to explain things to so the viewer knew what was going on (the main job of a Companion)."

"event","Who is your favourite Doctor?

Hard question! I actually don't like all the Doctors equally, and I believe that Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) should have been shot as a warning to those that like him. Sylvester McCoy was my first Doctor, which means that according to the general rule of fandom, I should like him best, but I don't. I like him more than Tom Baker, but I do think that Eccleston and Tennant beat him. For a long, long time I loved Paul McGanns's version, but not anymore.

I almost hate to admit it, but I think that Matt Smith is my favorite Doctor. Not just because he is the current Doctor, but because I think that he plays an aged character with youthful energy; somehow completely transparent and yet whose motivations are opaque; he is marvelous and handles all the contradictions of his role wonderfully."

I watch a lot of stuff from NetFlix, and but I don't think I watch <i>nearly</i>  as much tv as I did before I cut the cable. It's good that I've finally started going through my queues (both of them), but I find that the more that I watch, there more there is to see. It doesn't stop!

Today I started with <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235198/>Audition</a>. That was a mistake. I think it will scar me for life. 

Right after, I needed to watch something funny and uplifting, so I saw <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203540/>Greenfingers</a> which was a standard movie about prisoners in a low-security prison in England discovering gardening. It was indeed amusing and uplifting.

Later on, I finally got around to watching <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102951/>Soapdish</a> with surprise actor Robert Downey Jr! That was extremely funny and definitely what I was looking for. 

Currently watching <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102951/>Three and Out</a>. Billed as a dark comedy, I don't really think it's that funny. It's quite good, though.

Not much else happening with me this week. I did finish <i>The Two Towers</i> and start on <i>The Return of the King</i>, but haven't even finished the first chapter. Pippin is mainly sleeping while riding with Gandolf to Minis Tirith, which is making me sleepy and is not really helping anybody. On the other hand, I did have a nice nap this afternoon. So not all bad I guess."

I am now at the stage where I am getting signals that I might have overdone the orange juice. Also, despite excessive liquids (IMO) my head feels like I have large clumps of sand stuck in various places in my head. Fun? Not really.

I have been busy watching various movies on the DVR and off of Netflix;  so I will put this section under a cut-tag <lj-cut text=""so"">

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185266/>Stan Helsing</a>: I have no idea what I was thinking when I put this movie on my queue. I suppose one could make a drinking game every time you recognize a standard horror movie trope used badly, but that might result in alcohol poisoning. I did not know that Leslie Nielson needed the money so badly near the end of his life. Sad.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094077/>Surf Nazis Must Die</a>: a ""classic"" b-movie from Troma, not really as gory as most Troma films, but not very much to recommend it otherwise.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358856/>Little Britain</a>: Run out and get your hands on this show RIGHT NOW if you haven't seen it yet. <lj user=Glaive> and I were laughing hysterically while watching this show. I cannot praise it highly enough.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390109/>I Like Killing Flies</a>: Depressing documentary about a celebrated cafe in Greenwich Village, New York. Why is it celebrated? I don't know as I wouldn't eat there after watching this. The owner throws people out for no reason (or because they arrive in a group?), and the kitchen does not look very clean. Why do these things attract praise again?

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805978/>This American Life</a>: I enjoyed this, but then I also enjoy the radio show. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064048/>The Astro Zombies</a>: Just no. This is one of those where I say that ""I'm glad to have seen that, so I NEVER EVER have to watch it again."" <i>ever</i>.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486358/>Jesus Camp</a>: Thought this would be amusing, but this turned out to be one of the most frightening documentaries I've seen in a while.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/>Eraserhead</a>: One of the more boring and pointless movies I've ever seen.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0759097/>Creature Comforts America</a>: Not as amusing as I thought it would be.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119107/>Fast, Cheap and Out Of Control</a>: Also not quite what I thought it would be. Good, but not what I expected.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481449/>Hyperdrive</a>: I thought this would be funnier. <lj user=Glaive> liked it more than I did, but while somewhat funny, it just doesn't cut it for me. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200546/>Cool Air</a>: Interesting movie from the Lovecraft story. Well-acted, but I have to admit kind of boring. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094006/>Some Kind of Wonderful</a>: Weirdly enough, one of the few John Hughes movies I haven't seen. Pretty good, too. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063522/>Rosemary's Baby</a>: People warned me against this one. I found the book kind of blah. The book was better.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469641/>World Trade Center</a>: Not very good, unless you like sentimental dreck with flavors of patriotism. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115082/>3rd Rock From the Sun</a>: We have been rediscovering our initial love for this series. Still relevant.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026983/>She</a>: H. Rider Haggard, for all his turn-of-the-century imperialism, still wrote a better book. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026983/>American Zombie</a>: On the advice of <lj user=Ghost_Light>, I made this a priority and found a very well-acted, excellent and thought-provoking mockumentary. Also freaky as heck.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074281/>Car Wash</a>: I saw it, but am still not sure why. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231290/>Pregnant in America</a>: Documentary about a young couple researching their options to hospital births; made me glad I don't plan to have children.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790799/>$9.99</a>: Extremely sweet yet funny claymation about people in an apartment complex. A guy gets the meaning of life for $9.99 but no-one will listen to him.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120791/>Practical Magic</a>: A re-watch, but I really like the system of magic that is represented in the movie. 

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870980/>Spaceballs: the Animated Series</a>: An animated version of the movie, cut into 15 episodes. Not all the voice talent could be there. And badly animated. One of the few I couldn't stand to watch all the way through. I just had too much respect for the original movie.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/>Dexter</a>: Could not get into this one, either. People tell me they love this, but I just can't see it.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433540/>A Town Called Panic</a>: Brilliantly funny stop-motion animated movie. My favorite quote is still ""Plug in the fish, Cowboy!""

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090190/>The Toxic Avenger</a>: Troma movie that I found okay. Not great, but okay.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0358236/>Ultrachrist!</a>: What if Jesus Christ decided that he wanted to be a superhero in present-day (2003) Manhattan? Patrolling Times Square in a cape and stretchy pants battling sin wherever it might be. Loved this.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1484522/>Prop 8: The Mormon Proposition</a>: Why do I watch things like this? My mind is already made up; still it was interesting to see How They Did It.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1400526/>Lost Boys: The Thirst</a>: Might actually be a worthy sequel. Might have to watch it a few more times though.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231587/>Hot Tub Time Machine</a>: I know generally what this kind of movie will be like going in; I know I won't think this is great. Then I watch it anyway. Why do I do this to myself?

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756509/>Kyle XY</a>: I actually am liking this series a lot and am sorry that it was cancelled before I could find it on television when it was on.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780622/>Teeth</a>: Everyone has a guilty secret. Mine is that I like this movie. Definitely a feminist revenge all rapists, but they are one class of people I don't feel a whole lot of sympathy for.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/>Let the Right One In</a>: Best vampire movie I've seen in a loooooong time.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066670/>The Hilarious House of Frightenstein</a>: When I saw this, I thought I had gone delirious. DO NOT watch this after taking the bad acid, as this seems to closely mimic what a really bad and very strange trip would be.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410818/>Tying the Knot</a>: The more I watch documentaries like these, the more I realize that it isn't about ""family values"" or ""for the children""; it's about the money. Plain and simple, it's just about the money.

<a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0858486/>Battle for Terra</a>: Fairly well animated movie, with a very heavy-handed environmental message. And could it make the military complex more evil?
</lj-cut>

.........And <lj user=Glaive> just did the thing where he wanders in halfway through the movie and says ""Looks interesting. Could you not erase it? I may want to see it later"" and wanders off. Then wonders why am I tearing my hair out?

I know I watched more movies than that, but those were the only ones listed by Netflix, so could not remember all. Other than this fardling cold, I have been ok, trying to recover from work, resting, and cleaning. I cleaned out the foyer area just inside the front door, but have yet to actually clean the stairs or go any further. I'm sure I will soon. And I have plans to re-arrange the wiring for the computer and the external drives so they accidentally stop disconnecting (although something tells me they will always do that no matter what), but I want to do that after convention as I might take the computer with me. 

Reading has kind of taken a back seat, currently I am reading <i>Rebecca</i> by Daphne Du Maurier and am finding it hard going and easy by turns. Now that they have found the body, I expect it to go easier and hopefully finish it fairly soon. I have also joined a couple of podcast book clubs where I read the book then listen to the episode. It has really helped me get over some reading humps. 

Now back to self-dosing with orange juice and sleeping."

"event","This weekend has been very nice and relaxing. Slow-paced, which is good, although I did accomplish some things. I threw out all the stuff in the freezer and scheduled a pick-up date next Thursday for someone to come and take it away. Have to now get a bunch of extension chords for it as they want it plugged in and working before they will take it away, and it is sitting in the driveway currently. There is no way <lj user=""glaive""> and I are going to get it back into the house, but I think there are some outlets in the garage, so that should do.

<a href=""http://www.gallifreyone.com/"">Gallifrey</a> is going to be in a couple of weeks!! SQUEE!! Not that I'm excited or anything. Never me. I am the picture of calmness. And if you believe that, I have a bridge I can sell you relatively cheap as I need the money for convention. :p. I still have a few things I want to run around and collect; most urgent is some sort of variation on the decorative vegetable. I have a co-worker who is willing to crochet me one, and I have a couple of ideas on a few more types; I'm going to see how many I can get accomplished by the time to leave. Can't hurt to have back-ups after all. 

<lj user=""glaive""> gave me real metal jacks and a gyroscope for my birthday, as I had requested for costuming (and, let's face it, playing) with. I thanked him very much and we went out to <a href=""http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15252137498/pattys-burgers-tacoma"">Patty's Burgers</a> as they are very tasty. Last night, Mike gave me a fez, Stacy and Ev gave me handmade <a href=""http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/"">Cybermat</a>s. Dad gave me a Flight Controlled Tardis (in scale with the action figures and makes Tardis noises) and Mom gave me a necklace. Everything was marvelous. :D Thanks also to <lj user=""ghost_light""> for the puppy. I will make sure it doesn't fight with the cats. ;)

I haven't really seen as many movies as last time, although I have been trying to clear the DVR, and the movies tend to be at the bottom. I did see <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464154/"">Piranha</a> which was hideously gory. Honestly, if you are not a gorehound, you probably are not going to like this one very much. I did finish up <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038369/"">The Blue Dahlia</a> which was actually a semi-enjoyable noir from the mid-forties. I did spot a major flaw in it, however. I also got my box set of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038369/"">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a> which KICKS ASS. I'm tellin' ya, I could almost start my own '80's nostalgia channel here. 

All in all, a good weekend."

"event","Lately, I apparently need to re-learn the lesson of boomerangs or Karma, or something. Going through my list of books that I've registered at Bookcrossing, I cannot count how many of them have journal entries of ""Got this one back. Making available again."" or something similar. While I suppose that this is a First World Problem, it just amazes when things I give away somehow wind up in my possession again.  

A friend gave me a large bag of books that his parent was clearing out, and two of them were indeed Bookcrossing books! I also got a second copy of a Doctor Who-related book for Christmas that I already had, so I donated it to the Androgum Society as something for someone to take home, and it wound up as one of the prizes for the Doctor Who marathon on KBTC. (In addition to the normal pledge drive goodies they sometimes have a drawing for other stuff that all the donors can participate in) You'd never guess it, but YEP that book is coming back home.

 It makes me laugh, but at the same time I get so frustrated. Don't people WANT this stuff? These are popular books for the most part that I am giving away FOR FREE. I don't go looking for these, their path apparently leads back to me, where all I can do is try to send them on yet another journey. Next, I'm thinking of registering this book for Bookcrossing and leaving it at Gallifrey. Someone HAS to want it there. :)"

"event","I haven't watched quite as much lately, partly because I fell into some books, and partly because my long weekend ended and I had to go back to work. I did see <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278102/>Trembling Before G-d</a>, a documentary about homosexuals in the Orthodox Jewish community; it was interesting on several layers. 

The books I have been staying up late to read and reading all day (as much as I can) are <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Jumper-Novel-Steven-Gould/dp/0765357690/ref=pd_sim_b_1>Jumper by Steven Gould</a> and its sequel<a href=http://www.amazon.com/Reflex-Steven-Gould/dp/0312864213/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_3>Reflex</a>. If you have seen the movie Jumper, or stayed away because you thought it was horrible, do not hesitate to pick up these books. Yes, they are both about teleportation, but that is pretty much the only connection they have. <i>Jumper</i> is from the point of view of Davy, who starts the book at 17, learning he can teleport so he can escape an abusive, alcoholic father. Soon, he starts to explore his abilities, but mainly as a way to run away and survive in the world. Of course, can the government really leave him alone once they learn of him? An extremely good book and an amazing first novel by the author. <i>Reflex</i> is set ten years after the first book ends and mainly deals with some interesting questions. Can another person learn to jump? If you did manage to capture a teleport, how could you keep him? It is NOT pretty and has much more overt violence than the first book did, but it is just as gripping at the first one and kept me up 'till two in the morning last night so I could finish it. I'm really feeling that now, but I don't regret it.

Currently, I'm reading <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Jumper-Griffins-Story-Steven-Gould/dp/0765357852/ref=pd_sim_b_2>Jumper: Griffin's Story</a> although not with quite the same level of enthusiasm as I had heard that this more closely follows the movie. I am trying to give it some time to grow on me though, as I have just started it. Steven Gould is now my new favorite author. And I'm sure it will last until I read something else. ;D

Tired now."

"event","A little while ago, near the beginning of the month, I managed to get my hands on a blu-ray player that was capable of streaming to Netflix. Which is really the point of having a blu-ray player, IMO. So yes, my Instant Watch queue has both grown dramatically and I have been watching a <i>lot</i> of movies. This has been good for my movie watching, not quite as good for my book reading. Well, there are always pluses and minuses. So since then, I've seen 

1)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111333/"">The Swan Princess</a>. I had thought that this would be a better movie from the snatches I had caught on cable. I had a dream that the animation would be better than it turned out to be, that mayhap they might have preserved the original story in some way, that the musical numbers would not be intrusive. I was wrong. Pretty much the best part of the movie was the opening montage/musical number which showed the main characters growing up. After that, it pretty much went downhill. I applauded the main heroine for turning down the prince when he said that all she needed to be was pretty, but that was the ONLY time that this issue came up. Sigh. There was so much potential.

2)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/"">Fantastic Voyage</a>. Even though it was the mid-60's, I really disliked this movie that was apparently designed to teach anatomy to those who are on acid at the time. Not even Donald Pleasance can save this movie. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093260/"">Innerspace</a> was better.

3)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089877/"">Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer</a> What can I say? I vaguely remember liking Rainbow Brite when I was very young, and I even had her (toy) horse, Starlight. After watching this, I can only say that I was completely high as a kid. However, it does have a few things going for it: The main characters; heroine, villain, even most supporting characters are female. All major characters have their own horse. Bright colors, well animated (for the time). There are both fantasy and sci-fi elements. Boys only have supporting roles and have to be rescued by the heroine. No psychic shit--magic or ray guns only. (Psychic elements are okay, but the Psychic Chick in animation has been done to death.)

4)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088885/"">The Care Bears Movie</a> Again, I would argue that I was naturally high as a child, but I actually remember begging my mom to take me to the theater for this one. Looking at this again, all I can see is the marketers poised behind this. Was all my childhood so?

5)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/"">Nosferatu: The Gothic Industrial Mix</a>. Basically, the 1929 <i>Nosferatu</i> with a heavy metal/gothic mix instead of the usual pipe organ soundtrack. For me, it did make the movie even more spooky and I really don't think that this is something one should watch on gloomy winter days. 

6)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415679/"">Boy Eats Girl</a>. Cute Irish teens in a zombie movie. Good, plausible story, mildly predictable, and ok. Not great, but not something I hated.

7)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415679/"">The End</a>. Funnier than I thought movie with Dom Delouise and starring Burt Reynolds. Lots of cameos by other famous comedians of the time. Funny, but again kind-of-just ok.

8)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054988/"">Homicidal</a>. Early 1960's horror directed by William Castle. Things I learned from this movie include Transvestites Are Evil!!! (And yes, I say this with tongue firmly in cheek.)

9)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/"">The Boondock Saints</a>. Finally got around to watching this. Amazing movie. <lj user=""Glaive""> and I want to see it again. Possibly with subtitles. And maybe some production notes or commentary explaining some of the story. A good run, anyway, and we are also on the lookout for the sequel. 

10)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462246/"">Darkon</a>. In many ways this is exactly what I expected. That doesn't make it bad, just somehow ...... good but not great.

11)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155076/"">The Karate Kid</a>. Passable. In some ways better than the original. Really truly predictable, but come on, it's a remake.

12)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985694/"">Machete</a>. Oh. My. God. If you liked Boondock Saints or any of the Grindhouse movies, you will LOVE this film. Extra violent, somewhat sexy, pure exploitation. Heee.

12)<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104452/"">Houseitter</a>. Every so often I feel the need to revisit movies that I saw a long time ago and enjoyed, somewhat as comfort food, somewhat to see if they are as good as I remember. This was <i>nearly</i> as good as I remembered, but not quite.

<b>Book</b>:

<a href=""http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/8540715/"">To Stand Beneath the Sun by Brad Strickland</a>. For some reason, I enjoy searching out various books speculating about female dominated societies; in this particular book, the society is a human colony that went wrong: the ship only released a relative few of the colonists in the beginning and what colonists had expected to be a short-term shortfall in males, became a 4,000 year or so shortfall. Our Hero is one of the original colonists released by the colony ship who undertakes a Quest with a female captain to re-contact the colony ship and release the remaining colonists. It is not written well, IMO. I find the language somewhat stilted and the characters to be, for the most part, fairly established templates. There is some drama, but I think the author failed to sustain it adequately throughout the novel.

I do have some other books going, but have had a really hard time of late settling on any one book (especially on the ipod) for any length of time. Not happy with this, but hopefully this is only a relatively short-term thing."

Plus he likes me even though i talk ""funny"" i swear i can't wait till i'm outta school i can leave this place and never look bac. thats even if i make it that far. God these are the days i hate and these are the days that make me wanna OD or cut. but i promised a lot of ppl i wouldn't so i wont okay amy. but it becuz of my friends that i even wake up in the mornig cuz last year it was different i wanted to go to school cuz i had great teachers and great boyfriend and great friends well i last all that so now i just have friends and like 2 cool teachers wow what a big gain. i swear and they ask why i'm so depressed?? gotta go

Hey lins,
        sry bout the whole gainer thingy but u really got me mad. ok well i can understand if u don't want to be friends wid me caz i kinda feel the same way. ok cya l8ter.   Little Snow
 
 
and this is what i wrote
 
let me tell you something you went home after that cuz you couldn't face all those lies you told. you need to be a lil bit more of a friend okay and you really aren't liked bye n-e-of us so yea i could really care less i had a good night to night and i'm not gonna let you ruin it okay. so i hope you have fun in P.E cuz believe me you lost a really good friend cuz all that crap you said and it wasn't funny at all (o i have a latter) how dumd. Goodness you don't get it it was 5 to one do you really think we would of believed you no okay so i don't like you and if you would of stayed at school you would of known that but i guess you were to scared of what i might do but all i was gonna say is you need to admitt to what you did i mean i did but i guess thats the differences between me and you and another thing i'm like able and respectabl you go and talk behind ppl's bac which by the way isn't kool at all so you can suck my toe if you think i'm upset about losing you so have fun and i hope you get your butt kicked one day you have it coming!!!!
 
*~*Lindsey*~*
 
o i can't stand her if i get in one fight this year it's becuz of that lil bitch and ya'll can tell her what i called her. shoot i'll tell her cuz thats how i was raised i'm not scared of a near son of a bitch and thats what she is so if she wants to get expelled she can just bring it cuz her ass will be grass and if she trys being friends with me so help me god i don't fuck her up rite then and there. i can't stand that ho and who ever can i feel bad for you cuz she's a flat a slut and she might be proud of that. o wait in order to be a slut you have to have more than one guy and her case she has none and ya'll bitches and call me a slut all ya'll want but i don't give a danm cuz i have one guy and only one guy so kiss my ass or go fuck a dick!!!! and thats all i wrote cuz i'm getting really pissed now.

So yea now every one should no what happen but if you don't o well its a long story. And i mean long. But yea i'm now on anti-depression pills. I promise i'm not crazy just roundmy mom. When i'm around my friends i'm just fine but when i'm wit my mom my attuide changes. It tottaly suckz feeling like this. I swear if this keeps goin like this i told the doctors i could do one of 3 things. Run away (sucky idea not enough inpact on n-e-one) cut my self(not bad kust crazy) or my last resort Some how find aaway to get out of this bye no one ever seeing me again BANG BANG. But i wouldn't do that till my life doesn't get better and i have no friends stoping me which i have good friends which wouldn't be a problem keepin them. so if n-e-thing i'll go to cutin my self but hopefully not for a very long time.

"event","HEy ya'll today it really hit me. I know why i'm so depressed and ANGERED. (inside joke) Becuz Jimmy left. Last year i was so happy you wanna no why???? cuz i had Jimmy Courtney Jeff and of course Kasie. I went to Discovery, and had the koolest teachers. My life could not go wrong! But then it happened. Family Problems. The first one was goin to mckeel academy. (the best skool to my mom!) I mean not be mean i like that skool and the ppl there but it's not the same. I would rathered of gone in 9th and stayed at Dala for one more year but no it wasn't happening with my mom. Also sence Jimmy moved to Vermont I have noone to talk to cuz he was the only one that knew everything. When i said everything i mean everything! I keep it all locked in side me till i go see my consulor. and she don't help nothin she makes matters worst. I swear i can't live at my house. I've never been this emotional! plus when i'm with my friends or somewhere away from my mom i'm as happy and hyper as you can get, but when i come home it's not a pretty sight. I swear i hate my life and everything in my house. And you know that sayin Love is where the heart is and Home is where the ppl you love are. Well i feel no love and i no this isn't a family so i guess the only places i belong are either in Vermont or with Courtney, Jeff or Kasie, cuz i love my friends more than i love my family. Isn't that bad
well g2g for now i'll right bac l8ter

I don't wanna be me as always. I hate my life!!!!!!!!! i just feel like screamming. i would put some of my poems on here but someone might really think i'm crazy. Not like n-e-one doesn't. Everyone at my school thinks i'm crazy for doin to the ""doctors"" so much. But i guess there right if i have to live with my mom n-e-longer it wont be same old loveable lindsey it will be mad depressed and b****y lindsey. Thats the crazy one. And i think i have enough on my ""plate"" right now i don't need every one thinking i'm crazy. If ya'll think i'm crazy just plez keep it to ya'll's self i don't really care.

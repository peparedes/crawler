"event","I can't believe it's been since January that I've posted!  I've really meant to do it sooner, but life continues to be busy and complicated, and yes, I'm still using that as an excuse....

So, let's see... since then, I finished my season at The Rep, and it wrapped up with a wonderful, happy cast in a show with really great music, ELLA.  After that, I had a beautiful week off of complete laziness, after which I planned on starting on my cleaning and my list of projects to be done around the house, but before I could get started, I got a call to work JERSEY BOYS at the Fox (killer schedule, but really good $), and so I did that for a month, and that just finished up last week.  That, also, was a wonderful, happy cast in a show with really great music, so I enjoyed that a lot.  However, this show worked me much harder than ELLA did!  I dressed the girls, along with one other dresser, and there were only 3 of them, however, they all changed clothes at least 14 times, and the one girl changed 19!  Plus, their dressing rooms were on the 5th floor, and I took at least 5 trips up there per show... yikes!  At least I still felt like I was getting my workout in, because I wasn't able to go to the gym hardly at all on that schedule, so it was kind of a good thing.

Now I have 2 weeks off, and then I just found out I'm going back to the fox for MAMA MIA the first week in June.  I'm just stitching on this one, but hopefully I can hear the show and jam out on some Abba for a week.....

Oh, yeah, and an update on Doug since then.....  He had been cleared to go back to work from his arm surgery, and then, after working two weeks and having pain in his side, his own doctor confirmed what we had suspected for quite a while, that he did indeed have 3 severely fractured ribs, so he's back out of work again.... but hopefully (knock on wood) it won't be for too much longer...."

"event","Well, I feel confident now to say that I survived the holidays!  KISS ME KATE forced me to work way too hard, then with all the various family group gatherings Christmas was spread out over two weeks... then New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were my first 2 days of another tech week....  Yesterday was my day off after opening this new show, so I feel like I can finally breath a sigh of relief (although not too loudly, because I don't want to jinx myself...)  I'm very glad for the time off, but I find myself feeling a little restless... it's like I have too much free time all of a sudden!  I'm trying to relax and enjoy it for a while, before I get started on my many projects, and this short burst of really nice weather has made that easier!  

Here's hoping that 2008 is a much better year!!!"

"event","Alright, well KISS ME KATE continues to kick my butt!  It's a huge show, and takes more time than normal to prep, and longer time to do the laundry, and longer time to drive to the theatre because of all the stupid people going to do their shopping!  The show itself finally settled down some, but I still have WAY more to do than the average show!  It feels like all I do is go to work, and then go home to sleep, and then go to work again.  2 more weeks of this show, then new year's eve, and new year's day we start teching the new show.  At least it's only 2 people, and 1 costume each, so it'll be easy, but what an awful way to start it!  

We ended up getting about 7 inches of snow here.  It was AWFUL driving home at 1 am. Saturday night, but it sure looked pretty the next day.  And then today I actually had to shovel snow!  What a workout that is!  The last couple of years it's just melted before we got to it, but this time we got hit, and since Doug still has limited use of his left arm, I got to do all the fun work....  Of course it wouldn't have been quite as bad if I hadn't worked out with my trainer in the morning, so I'm sure I'll really be feeling it tomorrow!  

So, if I don't get back to it before next week.... 
                  HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Well, we got Kiss Me Kate opened... finally!  It was one of the longest, hardest, worst techs ever!  Blek!  But it's opened now, and hopefully things will settle down a little.... it's a very busy show, so I don't have much hope for that actually, but we'll see....  It's a large group and they all seem friendly, so it shouldn't be too bad (knock on wood!)

Other than that, I put our mini Christmas tree up last night!  I think I'll do the mantle with the stockings, and then call it done as far as decorating goes.  I don't have the energy to go full out this year, but I had to do something to brighten up the place!  I've decided against cards this year too.  I love doing them, but I knew it was just too much to pile on with everything else this year.

Doug's doing alright.  He goes a little stir-crazy and gets depressed staying home all the time (especially with me gone so much for work), but he's got a friend that came up for a couple of days this week and I know that'll help.  He's been doing physical therapy for about 3 weeks now, and is still hurting, but this should be the point where he starts to feel better now, so we're keeping our fingers crossed on that....  On the bright side, he is finally done with the brace on his arm, so that makes him happy!

That's all I've got for now...."

"event","It's been a long time....  but I think you all know what's been going on in my life, so I won't talk about that, I'm just going to ramble about work for a while....

I don't remember if I ever posted about the first show, but it wasn't much to write about....  Short, easy, uneventful....

Our second show, Dracula turned out to be more work, but a lot of fun!  I was really sad to see it go!  Kurt, our lead, was a ton of fun, and the inside joke was this:  I had to help hook him up to fly at the end of Act 1, and the Assistant Stage Manager always checked with me to see if he was good to go.  Kurt always gave me a hard time that no one ever asked him... we just treated him like a piece of meat, and so I called him Meat!  I even made him a Christmas ornament of a dog's chew toy shaped like a steak, in a dracula cape and flying harness.  It was a good time, and he was a great guy!  He took time after the show to give *C* a tour of his dressing room when Stacie brought her to the show, and he showed her his Dracula teeth, and gave her a Styrofoam bat that was hanging in his room to take home with her!  Neither Stacie nor I were smart enough to pull out our cameras, but it was fun to watch her with him, as she was being very brave, very curious, and just a little scared!

Now we move onto Kiss Me Kate, which is a big old fashioned musical.  Tech starts tomorrow, and I am just NOT excited about this one at all!  I know that once we get it open, it'll be a lot of fun, but just the thought of the hell that this tech week is going to be makes me want to crawl into my bed with my cats and not come out again!  I really hope my mood changes once we actually get into it, but right now....blek....I just don't want to do it!  I will, of course, but I wanna whine about it!!!

We went up to Doug's parents for Thanksgiving dinner today and was one of those perfect meals!  Lots of turkey and stuffing and all the good stuff, and I ate all of it!  And we brought left-overs home too!  Mmmmm....  Stacie and I did find new jeans to wear (as she mentioned in a previous post), and while they may not fit after today, I've decided I'm ok with that!  I've worked really hard on my diet lately, and I'm down 45 pounds total and I am giving myself some time off for the Holidays!  I figure, as long as I can keep up with my workouts (once tech week is over), and don't go too crazy too often, I'll be doing alright!  Now, bring on the egg nog!!!!!"

I usually stop at 20, and had planned on stopping at 30, but a gal that I had talked to in Yoga the other day came over and we got talking, so I stayed with her till she was done.  Next time we meet up there, we've agreed to do the step machine.  That will be another first for me!

I've been really bad about posting here, and just as bad lately at even logging on and reading what other people have posted....  I'll make it a point to log on tonight and catch up, but right now I have to go get ready to go have dinner with the Stacie, Steve, C and my dad, and maybe Doug if he gets off work in time.

"event","At the beginning of my ""time off"" this year, I decided, in no uncertain terms, that I was going to loose weight this summer.  I had modified my eating habits since just before Thanksgiving, and had gotten back to yoga classes with Stacie, and I lost a few pounds, but I decided that since I actually did have some time off, and the new gym situation figured out, that this was the time to really focus on me.  The new gym, as they always do, offered a special 3-pack of personal training sessions for a one-time-low-price, and I used my tip money from the last show to try it out, fully prepared to hate every minute of it.  In fact I told my trainer that right off the bat, but I did everything he told me to, and was surprised to find out that I was much stronger than I thought.  

Ty, my trainer, also talked a lot about diet, and convinced me to try out a more restrictive diet than I've ever done before.  I call it ""an experiment in extreme dieting"", but it's basically what they always say... lots of grilled chicken and veggies, limited carbs, eat several smaller meals, etc.  I also bumped up my workout program, and am happy to report that in just 3 weeks I've lost 8 pounds!  Yea me!  Now I just have to keep it up!  

The most challenging part will be when I start working again mid-June, but I'm hoping that by that point it's all set as habit and will be easier to keep up.  I'm finding, and I surprise myself by saying so, but I'm finding that I really like going to this gym!  It helps that I'm able to go late morning/early afternoon, when it's not as busy, or as full of the ""beautiful people"" as my mom calls them, but it's just really got a good atmosphere and great people.  I don't even mind the sweaty boys anymore!  Everyone's really just there to do their own thing, but they're friendly enough while they're doing it, so it works!  I'm even thinking of trying out some more classes while I still have the time.  Anyone ever done Kickboxing???

Oh, and yes, I have decided to splurge and buy a few more training sessions... I won't be able to afford that many more, but a few...."

"event","My grandmother was in my dream last night.  She passed away... let's see, is it 4 years ago?  We were still in Vegas, so it had to has to have been at least that....  Anyway...it wasn't really a significant dream, but it's left me strangely calm, and slightly anxious at the same time....  The calm I can understand, but I'm not sure about the other....  Here's what happened:

My grandmother, my dad, and I were on a train driving through the countryside.  When we pulled into the station, dad started helping her off, but I noticed that her coat and mine had been knocked off the seat and people were trampling on them in the aisle, so I stayed behind to get them, and brushed them off as I disembarked.  Once I met up with them again, I help Grandma get her coat on and I hugged her and told her I loved her.  Then I started to cry.  Only I started to cry in real life, and that's what woke me up... it was about an hour before my alarm, but I wasn't able to fall back asleep, so I just stayed up.  They weren't really sad tears... the were just tears.... and I didn't feel like crying once I woke up, so I don't think it was my emotional need acting out through my dream, so I really don't understand it all... and yet, I can't stop thinking about it....

I know the standard dream analysis text would probably say the train represents a journey.....  I don't discount that, but I don't think that's what's important here... maybe nothing is, I don't know....  I just know I feel very unsettled....and yet I feel like I shouldn't be.  Does that make any sense?  Maybe I should have just tried harder to fall back asleep...."

"event","Well, I've finally made it to the new gym!  3 days in a row, as a matter of fact!  Yea, me!  Of course, I won't be able to go again for a week and a half now, because we're opening yet another show, but I'm feeling very motivated and proud of myself this week.  

I know that Staceid's written about the whole New Lady Fitness closing, and our having to go to Club Fitness with stinky boys, so I won't go into that, but I do have to agree with her final conclusion, that it isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be....  In fact, I kind of like it.  A few of the stinky boys talked to us today, and they were all real friendly, and generally everyone is just doing their own thing, so it's all good....  In addition to that, I have a little crush on my stinky boy trainer, so that's motivation to go to the gym in and of itself!  haha!  In fact, he's motivated me to purchase the introductory 3-pack of personal training sessions to really sweat for him.  Doug wasn't thrilled about the money aspect of it, but I figure he spends money on stinky ol' cigarettes every week, so I should totally be allowed money for a healthy habit, right?!  ...and then we'll just wait and see what the price jumps to after the intro deal!  The other thing I love about the new gym is that they offer yoga on Tuesdays mornings, so Stacie and I can take that together each week!  (although I do miss the hot tub that our original gym had....sniff....)  All in all, this is geared towards being in Deona's wedding in May, in addition to the trying-to-get-in-better-shape-and-loose-weight-just-'cause-it's-good-for-you idea....  So far, I'm down almost 20 from my highest weight, so I'm feeling really good about life right now.

I'm not feeling good about the next show.... it's FULL of quick changes....  I'm a little stressed about it, but I think I'm going to actually do some more prep work on it today, so hopefully that'll ease up as I get more prepared....  

There was one other thing I was going to write about here, but it seems to have left my brain, so.... and I'm not sure why I even mentioned it, but that's just the way I am...."

"event","With only a few more hours left in 2006, I decided I'd better write about my Christmas now, or I never would, so here goes.

Christmas was great!  It was very busy, because my cheap ass company didn't give us any extra time off for the holiday since it fell on our usual day off.... no, I'm not bitter.  We had a matinee on Sunday, and then rushed out to Beaufort to celebrate with Doug's parents.  We even ended up going to their Christmas service, which was kind of unexpected....  The original plan was that I would get home by 5, and we could be to their place by 6 to eat and then to the Children's pageant (always amusing!) by 7.  Well, we didn't figure on quite as many people taking the back way as there were, so we didn't get to their house until 6:30.  The actual Christmas church service was at 8 and we hadn't talked about going to that at all.  Somehow, after dinner, Doug's mom, trying to fill a momentary silence with chatter, said ""You don't want to go to the church service at 8, do you?"".  Well... I hadn't... I had thought about making it back to St. Charles in time to make it to midnight mass with my sister, but not to their service.  But then when she mentioned it, it sounded like a good idea, so I said, ""Sure!  Why not!""  Of course, as soon as I said that I realized that no one else was really that enthused to go, but things seemed to be in motion and we were on our way... besides, no one else spoke up to say they DIDN'T want to go....  It was a nice service, and they did candle light caroling, which is always fun... even if the organist played every song in a key higher than anyone could sing!  I think everyone enjoyed it, but it still makes me giggle thinking about how we got there.

Doug and I did our Christmas that night, and he totally blew me away by getting me a Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  Really didn't expect that!!!  Of course I had to bake more cookies so that I could try it out, and I have to tell you, I think they taste better!  

Christmas morning found us at Mom's house with Christmas with her, Doug, my brother Kevin, and my sister <lj user=""Staceid""> for our new tradition of Brunch, which is a very yummy tradition!  After lots of gifts and lots of laughter, we parted ways.

After a few hours of mindless TV and computer games, Doug and I cooked up dinner for my Dad.  The pie didn't turn out as well as I had hoped, but everything else was perfect and we had a good time visiting with Dad!

The week after that was busy with closing one show, and making preparations for the next (which we, unfortunately, start teching tomorrow morning.... yuk!).  And then yesterday, we have our final Christmas with <lj user=""Staceid"">, <lj user=""Mustard76"">, and C.  This time we did more of a Continental breakfast and presents, and of course lots more laughter!

Tonight, Doug is working, and I am trying to work up the energy to take down the Christmas tree.  We have a bottle of champagne chilling for when Doug gets home (hopefully by 1), then it's off to bed for me since tomorrow will be early and very, very long....

Happy New Year!  I hope 2007 is a good one for all of us!"

They were such a great group, and it was such a fun show to work....  I hung out the last two nights with some of the cast and crew, and just had the best times ever!  I SO needed this show!!!  Now, I'm in a better frame of mind to face the rest of the season.  The next one, MUSICAL OF MUSICALS, THE MUSICAL is another really easy show (good thing, since I plan to use my time to work on my best friend's wedding dress), and then the last 3 of the season are going to be more challenging, but I'm trying not to think about them yet.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to doing nothing...."

"event","Today started off kind of rough....  We've been having problems with our computer lately, nothing too major...but Doug decided to take a look at it last night.  Sigh.  He tried to re-install something and ended up making the computer loop on itself trying to boot up.  So today he decided to call a buddy of his over to take a look at it.  He was free which was good, except that Doug then needed help clearing off the table and getting the computer unhooked so that they could work on it, which made me late in meeting up with Stacie and Carolyn, and my friend Kim and her daughter Holly to go down to the Festival of the Little Hills.  

I hate being late.  I really do.  Especially if it isn't even MY fault!  So I was kind of in a foul mood when I showed up at the High School.  It lasted until the time we got on the shuttle to the festival and C sat next to me with a big ol' grin.  (Her grin didn't quite last the whole day, but it sure was a nice way to start!) We had a lot of fun walking around and talking.  We did a little looking in the booths (mostly to stand in front of their fans for a while), but it was pretty much the same stuff they had down there last year, so we didn't look too hard.  We did try out the deep fried Oreos, which weren't quite what I was expecting.  They were tasty, but I think I would rather just eat regular Oreos and a glass of milk.  Oh, I almost forgot, at the stop for the shuttle we ran into the parents of one of my friends from High School!  He and Kim and I were pretty much inseparable my Junior and Senior year.  He doesn't keep in touch anymore, but we drop by and see his folks at least once a year, so it was nice to see them!  All in all, it was a very hot day and we all sweated a lot (aren't you glad I shared that?!), but it was great fun!  Once I got home, I discovered that in my haste to get out the door this morning, I forgot to put sunscreen on my face (something I don't ever forget for these kind of events!).  I'm a little red, but not too bad.... we did try to seek out the shade wherever possible, so I think that saved me.

On the home front, we owe Brian a steak dinner for fixing the computer!  Yea!  Apparently, when we added the new drive earlier this year, something wasn't done right by the ""pro"" we paid to set it up.  Anyway, they were able to reset everything on the computer back to then, so we didn't quite loose everything, but we did loose some.  I'm just glad I backed up all the pictures about a month ago!  That's timing, eh?!  I haven't checked my documents yet, but I don't think I've added anything recently, so they should be ok.  Bookmarks and whatever else we lost... well, I've just come to accept that as part of the risk of living with computers...."

"event","Well, last week I realized that I only have a 2 more weeks before I have to start working back at the Rep.  Needless to say, I'm not ready!!!  The first show is going to be a huge one... I have 8 dressers!  EIGHT!!!  Anyway, I can't think about that yet... I don't have to and you can't make me!... not until next Monday at least, and then I'm going to go set my room up and start deciphering the script.... sigh...

In the meantime, I'm trying to be motivated and get a lot done so that I feel like I accomplished something this summer!  Last week I re-caulked my shower and re-painted my living room.  This time, the color is perfect!  I still have a little section left to paint around the window, but that involved heavy furniture moving, so I decided to wait for Doug on that one.  

Today, I'm going to the gym!  Yea!  I haven't been since... well, since.... and I know I only have a few weeks, but I really am going to keep going once work starts up again!  My best friend is getting married next May, so I have to slim down by then!  I've been doing really good with the treadmill lately, but the gym is the real motivational test for me!  And I'm going with Stacie, so we're going to motivate each other for a little while!  Yea us!

I don't really have any more big projects to get done, but there's lot and lots of little things I want crossed off the lists!  Repairs for Stacie, alterations for Mom, cleaning my sewing room, organizing/clearing off the kitchen table, finding comfortable black shoes for work... 

Last week, I went out to the Muny to see SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, the last show of the season.  It was really good.  The costumes were really pretty, and the dancing was great!  The main motivation to go, was that they was a ""tailgate"" party for the crew after the show, so I went to network a little.  Doug was free to go with me (after some prying off the couch) and he got to network a little too, so that worked out well.  Several people told me that they were happy with my work and that they'd see me next summer!!!  Next year, LION KING is at the Fox for 6 weeks, and it crosses over the dates for the Muny, so it looks like I'll have work next summer as well!  Yea! I mean, I don't want to count my chickens or anything but... yea!  

Well, Stacie should be calling for the gym any time now, so I'm going to go stretch and get ready.  Go team!"

Your vivid emotions and imagination takes you away from this world
So much so that you tend to live in your head most of the time
You have great dreams and ambitions that could be the envy of all...
But for you, following through with your dreams is a bit difficult

You are charming, endearing, and people tend to love you.
Forgiving and tolerant, you see the world through rose colored glasses.
Underneath it all, you have a ton of passion that you hide from others.
Always hopeful, you tend to expect positive outcomes in your life.

"event","Well, I finally thought of the thing that I couldn't remember to post about....  (did I even mention that I couldn't remember something....)  Anyway, I went to the allergist to get tested, and I found out that the thing I'm most allergic to is my cats.  Sad!  Not that I'm going to get rid of them or anything... I'll just have to wash my hands more now that I know.  I'm thinking about doing the shots, but it's a full time commitment, so I'm sticking to the drugs for now.

On the work scene, I'm getting more and more Union stuff this summer!  I get to work LES MIZ next week and I am very VERY excited about that!!!  They're closing the tour here in St. Louis, so until the revival, I will be working the very last show of LES MIZ!  Did I mention it's my favorite show ever?  It's my favorite show ever!!!  Then today, I got a call to work not only a day call at the MUNY tomorrow (8am sucks, but the work is good) and I get to work the Faith Hill/Tim McGraw show on Friday!!!  I'm not sure if I'm actually working the show, or just doing the prep work and then leaving, but I certainly hope I get to meet them and at least see some of the show!  

Doug's had good work so far this summer too (knock on wood).  He had to work on the Fourth, which kinda sucked since we had the 2nd annual Fehr/Fortenberry BBQ, but he was off the next day so we were able to go prove his existence to the Fortenberry clan and share in Steve's superman cake (complete with Kryptonite candles).  

Speaking of the Fourth, the duckweed has taken over our lake again (making for some ugly fishing on the Fourth).  It cleared up for about 2 days and now it's worse then ever.  We've had some dead fish show up too, which is always loads of fun.

The last thing I'll mention is that I have painted my living room.  In the very bright daylight it's the perfect shade of 'Sunshine', but since there's very limited time when we have the perfect light, it's way too dark and I'm now playing with layering a lighter color ('Classic Sand') over it with kind of a dry brush technique.  ...not sure I like the new look either, but I'm going to live with it for a little while and see.  That's the good thing about paint though, it's easy to do-over!  Well, not exactly easy...."

"event","So lots has gone on that I need to write about, but I don't know that I'll have time to do it all before my lunch is ready, so we'll see how far I get....

PHANTOM is going well.  I like my girls, even though one is on vacation right now, and her replacement is a little snotty.  I dress 3 of them in the chorus, and there are 12 in the area all together with me and 3 other dressers, so it's a pretty good time.  The other dressers are all young, which doesn't bother me until they say things like, ""When did you graduate from High School?  Wow, I was 3 then!""  Yikes!!!  Anyway, 2 of them are the daughters of the big-wigs in the Union, which is both good and bad.  They like me, so that's good, but the bad is that I feel like I always have to watch what I say if I want to continue working for the Union in the future.  It's a very VERY political bunch, with 2 different families vying for control.  I just try to be nice, do my job, and stay out of the politics!  So far, so good, I think.

We finally convinced the Electric Company that the dead tree in our yard was going to down their line sometime, and they should take it out, which they did earlier in the week!  Yea!!!  That saved us at least $2000!  It was very cool to watch though, 'cause it was a very tall tree.  It took 2 days, 5 guys, and lots of rope, but now we have firewood to last us for about 20 years!  Also, we have a stump, which I know Carolyn is going to claim as her own personal seat....

Um, there was more, but I don't remember now what I was going to write....  Hate when that happens!!!  Oh, well, my pizza is almost ready, so I should go eat and go to work.  I'll try to post again soon...."

"event","So yesterday was a very long day.  I got up at 8am for the Roto Rooter guy, who was coming out for the tree root treatment, but he had the ""new prototype"" machine which is too big for our basement door.  The second guy was supposed to come at 2 and didn't get there till after 6!  Sigh....   

I actually read most of the time, so that was kinda nice.  I figured if I had to be stuck at home all day, I should at least relax a little.  Of course all I did last week was a whole lot of nothing, so I don't know why I needed to relax.   I felt kind of blah and on the edge of being sick all week, so I had one day where I got a few things accomplished, but other than that, I did nothing.  My biggest accomplishment of the week was that I searched for black jeans.  I eventually found them at Wal-Mart (thanks Mom for the tip).  They're a little big, but they were $9 on the clearance rack, so I bought the last two pair they had!  Even with the great find, I still HATE Wal-you-know . . . I can't even say it again!!

Today was the 1st day of Phantom and I'm tired!  And tomorrow is going to be an even longer day, so I'm going to bed now.  I hate opening new shows.  I love to run them, but I really . . . REALLY hate to open them!  

You know, after spell checking this, I realized that I used the word hate a lot in this entry, when in reality there are very few things in this world that I really hate.  You just happened to get two of them today.  Aren't you lucky?!"

"event","Last week, I ended up getting really sick again with allergies.  I'm planning on going to a specialist sometime in the next couple of weeks to find out what specifically I'm allergic to, because this is much worse than it's ever been and I hate it.  I have total sympathy for Stacie now, 'cause she's had allergies all her life... I've recently developed them and I'm such a baby.....  The Dr. put me on Prednisone last week for it (a steroid) which really messed with both my body and my mood, although it did clear up my lungs again, but I pretty much hid out last week.

Over the weekend, I somehow managed to see my mom, Tony, and Kevin twice!  The first time was to try out a new pizza joint in Chesterfield (very good!) and the second was because Tony was cooking an Italian feast, and I don't know that he knows how to cook for just 3 people....  All in all it was a good time though, and good food, so....

This week, I'm back at the Shakespeare Festival.  We're working really long hours (10-7) this week to get ready for Tech. which starts on Saturday.  I'm glad I decided to work with them, but I'm not sure I'll be doing it again.  The girl in charge of Costumes isn't very organized, so now we're working the extra hours trying to get stuff done.  The first week and a half that I worked, we pretty much wasted half the day, every day, which was fun, but I would have rather gotten a jump on the work back then!  Plus the company is nickle-and-dime-ing me to death!  They pro-rated my first week's paycheck because I didn't actually start until Wed, which is understandable on one hand, however they're not going to compensate me for working through the weekend this week!  Sometimes I really hate being on salary....  Oh, well, I didn't do it for the money.... I did it for the connections and the experience.... This morning I don't know why that sounded like a good idea, but it did when I said yes, so I'll see it through to the end....  Opening it the 26th, so 10 (possibly fewer) days left....

Oh, and did I mention that the shop space we're working out of is down at SLU, so I have to drive 40 min. each way too!  ...and pay for parking!  Yuck.

Ok, I really thought that taking the time to write this all out this morning would make me feel better, but somehow it hasn't.  I'll have about a week off after this before I go back to crazy theatre hours working PHANTOM.  Maybe I should just focus my mind on my week off and see if that puts me in a better mood...."

"event","OK, time for a quick update. 

I had last week off and it was great!  I did a whole lot of nothing, read quite a bit and sat on my porch, and had some good family time.  It was perfect!  Here are the highlights:  1) We had Easter dinner with Doug's parents on Sat. and had a good visit with them.  2) I had my massage with Stacie, where we also got to see the Weinermobile in the parking lot!  Good coincidence, eh?!  3) I got to watch Carolyn in her musical program entitled THE THREE PIGGY OPERA, which was a fabulous musical version of the 3 Little Pigs!  4) Mom and Tony and Doug and I had dinner one night at Mama Campisi's (sp?) on the Hill, then we went to see Valerie Harper in GOLDA'S BALCONY, which was very good! (and nicely comped by the Rep)  5)  Sunday I went with dad to the 1st round playoffs of the St. Louis Steamers.  We beat the pants off Chicago 9-2!  Next Sunday they play here in the final playoff game and hopefully we'll beat the Baltimore Blast then too!  It'll be on ESPN2 as well, so if any of you want to watch....  The first game is Friday, I think, but I don't know if it's going to be aired anywhere.....    

Tomorrow I start work for the Shakespeare Festival.  (I'll have to search and do a link sometime, but I don't feel like it now....)  I'm working in their costume shop for about 3 weeks.  It's not a lot of money, and a long drive (their shop space is at SLU), but it's a chance to be creative for a while, and work days like a ""normal"" person, so it'll be good.  

Good news, I got the call to work Phantom of the Opera!  This is what I was really wanting this summer and it came through!  Yea!  That's back to a Rep-like schedule for a month (June to be precise), but it'll be paid like the position SHOULD be paid!  I'll be both on the maintenance crew (laundry and repairs) and the dressing crew.  As a bonus, a friend of mine is going to be coming in town with the tour and working the show for the first 3 weeks, so that'll be extra fun!

On a totally different note, I had to take Phish in the the animal clinic on Sunday.  One eye was all gooped up and giving him a lot of pain.  They said it was most likely conjunctivitis and I now had a cream to put in his eye 3 times a week.  It's cleared up a lot, but he hates the medicine of course....  Now I just have to make sure I remember it when I get up early all this week....  Don't you just hate it when you baby gets sick?!"

E-Bay caught it and suspended my account, and they were very helpful in clearing everything up.  We're good to go again now, which is good, but I don't feel quite as safe on-line as I used to...."

"event","I'm done, I'm done, I'm done!!!  Yea!!!  

It was a really good closing too.  They tipped me REALLY well, including some people that I didn't expect to tip at all!  And the crew even wrote me a lovely thank you note telling me how amazing I am.  One of them flirted with me a little bit too... so what that he's a Freshman in College.... a good flirt is a good flirt, and does wonders for the ol' ego!  

The highlight of the night was our experimentation with several 2 liters of Coke and Mentos (the fresh-maker!).  Some of the actors heard on NPR's All Things Considered the night before, that combining the two results in a fountain of soda.  It did work, but apparently there are several variables that affect the height.  We did 3 bottles with various results, but it was all great fun.  Doug says he's seen video before on the internet, so I plan to research it some and see what's supposed to happen.

Packing up the show and the rest of the shop took a little longer than I anticipated, but that happens a lot when it comes to packing so....  All that matters is that I'm done now!  Now let's just hope that they don't loose any of my stuff over the summer.

Tomorrow we're supposed to go up to see Doug's folks... I think....  and then maybe we're supposed to meet up with a friend that's in town from Vegas and leaving tomorrow night.  I know that they'll both be fun, but I just wish I had a day to do nothing tomorrow....  I do however, have a massage to look forward to with my sister this week!  (I need to remember to call on Monday and set it up.)  That's my birthday present to her, as well as to myself, and my muscles are quivering with anticipation.  

Now I should really go and try to fall asleep.  Yeah, good luck with that...."

"event","Yea spring is here, and with it BBQ season!!!

Sunday was my birthday and it was a fabulous day!  I had one show (not the fabulous part), but left the theatre before it was dark, which was pretty amazing in and of itself!  When I got home, Doug had BBQed some pork steaks - the first of the season!  Yummy!!!!  Then later that night we had a big fire and burned up all the branches that had fallen out of the trees during the last several major storms.  It was a huge fire and we discovered that marshmallows taste the same toasted even if they started out stale.  It was a very relaxing, great night!  

Monday was my last day off of the season and I did a whole lot of nothing during the day, and went out to dinner with Mom and Tony that night.  

Today we woke up to luke-warm showers, but thanks to our home warranty, we only paid $60 for a $350 repair on the hot water heater and we are now back in business.  

This week... did I mention it's my last week of work?!?!... I have 2 creature features (10:30am, yes am!), 6 shows total in 4 days.  I also have to pack up my entire shop, and then Friday night pack up the show to send it off to Cincinnati Playhouse.  Busy, busy week, but then it's done.  And not a minute too soon!  I'm tired!

I don't know when my next job starts, but I'm hoping to lay low for a few days and take Stacie and myself for our birthday massages before I have to start work again.  We'll see.  Happy Spring!"

"event","Ok, so last week turned out to be a very busy week.  I think I already wrote about Tues. and Wed....  

Thursday I got up early for the Steamers game!  It was a great game, even though they lost, and Joe Reiniger didn't score his 600th career goal like he was supposed to (He scored it on 4/1).  They're still in 1st place, and going to the playoffs, but the loss ended their record of no losses at home the entire season.  It also sucked, because the loss came because of a goal with only 1:20 left in the game.  I would have so loved it to go into overtime!  Oh, well.... 

Friday I got up early to go to the Touhill, where Doug works.  They were putting in a dance show that was produced/staged/costumed by 2 people that I used to work with in Branson, so I went to watch the show and visit with them for a little while.  It was very cool!  

Saturday we got up early to go down to the <a href=""http://www.missouritartandayfestivities.com"">St. Charles Tartan Days</a>.  I guess it's been going on for 5 years, but only the last 2 have been a full weekend.  It was cool.  We got to see the parade, several bagpipe bands (I love these!) and some drum bands.  We ate Birdies (sorta like a meat pie) and Funnel Cakes (not exactly Scottish, but yummy none the less).  We watched a little bit of caber tossing and the tossing the sack over a 40ft. bar with a pitchfork (this must have another name, but I don't know what it is....).  We were only able to stay for about 2 hours because I had 2 shows that night.

That night sucked because after leaving work at 1am, I lost an hour (I know, everyone did) and had to be back at work by noon on Sunday for 2 more shows.  Needless to say I was pretty exhausted by the time I got home Sun. night.  

Monday, Doug and I tried to go to our favorite, recently re-opened restaurant on the Hill, Mama Campisi's.  However, contrary to what it said in the newspaper, they are not open on Mondays.  Suck!!!  That then became a quest for pasta, and after another hour of so of searching we ended up at Pasta House at Crestwood Plaza.  We did stop at Amighetti's for bread while we were down there.  Yum!  The rest of the night we just watched TV, and I played Sims for a while.  Not exactly an exciting day off, but very relaxing.

Today, I'm working on finishing up the paperwork for the show, then I'm going to head into work early and get started on packing up my shop.  Only 2 weeks left!!!  Yippie!"

"event","I think if the powerball drawing had been yesterday, I would be rich at this moment.  However it was today, and today was a 180 degree turn from yesterday, so needless to say I am not a millionaire and none of you should be expecting a check from me anytime soon....  sigh....

Today was really bad, just very not good.  It wasn't anything big, or even really important, but it was just a frustrating day and I'm just really tired, PMSing, and ready for a break!  Unfortunately, I have 2 1/2 more weeks of very busy days, with only 2 days off before I start stitching for the Shakespeare Festival.  Don't know exactly what those hours will be yet, but I've agreed to work for them for a couple of weeks.  It's the show that takes place near the Art Museum in the summer.  Yes, a make-shift out-door theater, without a ""real"" backstage, during a Missouri summer.  Been there, done that!  You can see why I declined their Head of Wardrobe offer, but I will be sewing, which I think will actually be a really good change for me.

Anyway, I would write more about the bad day itself, but I have a feeling tears would follow and I just don't have the energy for that right now, even though it's probably just what I need.  I'm going to go veg on the couch for a while instead and then go to bed.  I'm going to a 10:30 am Steamers game with my dad!  The am part I could do without, but the game with my dad is worth it.  Hopefully they'll all be having a good day and win it!"

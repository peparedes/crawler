Mind you ... its not an entirely negative change, its just a sign that the world is continuing to spin around you , even if you aren't moving along at the same pace. No matter how stagnant you have become in your own life, Gaia doesn't stop with you... and neither do others."

"event","Happy 21st birthday to Desarai in ... 56 minutes !
 wow it has been ages since I have taken the time to write anything in here.. which is pathetic really considering how much time i sit in front of the computer !
 So basic news within the past while that I have neglected to write about .. 
1. Birth of Kaiden Bradley Graham Mosher .. Desarai's first.. a beautiful baby boy ...we're old now Des !  
2. Health - found out that what the doctors thought was hypoglycemia is not.. it is something else, some sort of genetic predisposition to diabetes .. I am on new medication that makes me feel sick .. they say that it will help with the weight that i gained because of my insulin issues.... ha I think its because you spend so much damn time throwing up ! maybe those Bulemics are onto something :P  ( sooooo joking .. yes i know.. horrible joke ). I realized today just how bad my health is when i had to buy a weekly pill organizer !! hahah 14 pills a day is a tad excessive i would think !  
3. The start of College - I started at the Canadian therapeutic college.. its different to say the least.. I love being back in school, but the work load is starting to get heavy , and well .. still not sure around my classmates.. I feel really insecure around them .. which is definately not cool considering we end up having to get neked in essence around each other... woohoo massage class haha. 
4. Guys suck .... wait thats not anything new .. just confirmed yet again"

"event","Yet again it has been too long since I last updated !haha and I really can't blame it on being to busy to take the time to write anything... haha instead i blame it on .... you guessed it ... laziness !
 So recently i have come to realize how quickly people come can come into ... and leave your life .. Quite like a flame from a match , you only have a given amount of time with each person .. and no matter how you to try to draw a dying friendship out, it can't be the same as it was in the beginning, nor should it be.. We need to stop trying to keep something alive that doesn't want to be ... and just accept it for what it was.. and enjoy it while its still lit.. If that makes any sense whatsoever. I got to thinking about this after noticing that there are some people that I really don't speak to anymore.. some after whirl wind romance type things, some simple friendships, even some family relationships 
 To those from the past.. i will treasure those memories with you always... to those of the present... I can't wait to see where things lead.. And one can only look to the future.. Take everyday for what it is.. live it like its the only chance you'll get. 
 al - thinking of you"

"event","amazing... a second entry within the same month ! 
 I did it again... i turned down a fig.. lol well not as much of a fuck in the garden , as much as a fuck in a car. ( haha it still counts... its outside :P ). Why would i do such a silly thing you ask because this guy is as yummy as they come ? well ... i am not so sure.. but i just couldn't bring myself to do it, maybe its because of my feelings for other people , maybe it was just my sensible side coming out to play... either way .. i am now penis free for the evening... So bring on the chocolate instead !
 So today i was supposed to go for the lovely once a year appt that every girl looks forward to with their doctor... you know the one...""alright this might feel a little cold..  make you sure spread your legs a bit further dear...so how is your day going ? "" .. yep thats right.. a pap/std testing and all that loverly stuff  ( all of which is required to get my birth control prescription ), but Beamsville medical centre has once again proved how brilliant their office staff are. So this morning i got ready for my appt ( well as ready as you can ever be for having a plastic thing that looks like a duck shoved up your whoohoo ), and went on my way for my 1 o clock appt that the staff had kindly written down for me at my last appt.. well i went in, and was promptly informed that ..... no my appt was not at 1 , but had been scheduled for 11 that morning, and that i would not be able to re book until NOVEMBER !!!! Now, as much as i am a procrastinator at heart I don't appreciate it when other people do it for me ! especially when it comes to my health .. 
 It really is pretty ridiculous that to get an appointment with my family doctor any of her patients have to wait several months.. Definately makes me thankful for walk in clinics ! I don't overly like my doctor as she is one scary scary lady but i want to be able to see her if i need to ! oh well ! 
 hmm what else is new ..... hmm oooh thought of something ! i have a new project.. I am turning one of my walls into a wall completely covered with photos of all my friends and family. I had had all my photos in photoalbums,but realized that i never actually took the time to take them out and have a look through, so this way i will be able to see them all the time ! hahah unfortunately it require a lot of sticky tack , and well .. me and sticky tack have our issues... 
 speaking of issues.. now , i know that i am just one large walking issue... but man have i got myself in a pickle... and its all because of guys ! haha this is not an unusual problem for me , as i always seem to find myself in the oddest situations when it comes to the opposite sex. What is it this time you ask ? well i have feelings for a fellow who lives away ... who i think possibly might have feelings for me, but i know he is crushing on other girls... and other guys want to be with me... damnit damnit damnit . why do i have to fall for the ones i can never have"

"event","It was brought to my attention recently that i haven't updated my journal in the past few weeks. The time has just been going by so quickly that I haven't thought about it, it seemed honestly like i just updated.. but before i knew it, its almost the end of the month and i haven't written since july ! 
 There have been a bunch of things that i haven't really mentioned but could have... like being diagnosed with hyperglycemia, having to test my blood all the time, the new and not so new boys in my life, startingschool in less than a week, completing a cpr course ( i am now fully able to perform cpr on a plastic dummy named fred ).. but meh thats not as interesting as some of my other news ;) 
 Lol so i went out with some of my best girls on the weekend ( over to hess in hamilton) , can honestly say it was easily one of the best times i have had this summer . We started our evening at miss krystals for a bit of predrinking..lol which turned into me drinking almost 2 litres of wine cooler before heading out the door and into hess..but definately a gret night that included running into my cousin, dancing, discussing the dangers of ass raping, and signing a random mans ass.
 That night was the stepping stone for another interesting night to come for sure .. after getting onto the regular topic of sex, the girls and i came to the conclusion that we need to have a sex party where apparently i have been elected to teach everyone how to give blowjobs ! more info to follow"

"event","I realized today ( after almost being run over by a car in search of corn at a roadside fruit stand whilst starting at some plants )that i don't pay enough respect to the simple pleasures in life... I suppose that is not unusual in any way shape or form, as most people don't take the time out of their busy schedules to see the beauty in the sunshine shining on grapes growing on a vine that has grown for 100 years or in seeing an old couple walking hand in hand after  years of marriage or innumerable things such as that. So this evening i am taking the time to recognize those simple things that bring me joy , contentment, and sometimes just a hearty laugh. Maybe if you're reading this , you will be tempted to do the same.. reflect on whats important in your life.. is it really those hours that you spend at work or running around trying to organize things, is it really bringing home a pay check and not taking time for yourself ? So here goes... this is what makes me happy .. this is what puts a smile on this face of mine.
 Dancing around the house singing along to my favorite song blaring... naked !,running out into the backyard during the rain  just to feel the cool water run down my face and body, driving with my mom as she laughs her butt off as i stall the car, making someone laugh so it shows in their eyes, rocking out to oldies with my parents, sharing a bottle of wine with miss heather over sex stories and some chocolate, lying in a hammock with a good book while the sun shines down on my face, seeing little kids play together ( haha and then laugh when one kid pushes the other ),hot chocolate spiked with baileys irish cream, family functions where undoubtedly someone gets drunk as a skunk ( ssh its not always me ), going on a horrible  horrible date... getting home and laughing knowing that there will always be another one, watching fireworks overhead late in the summer nights, sitting out on muskoka chairs by the pool with a mug of chicken noodle soup while  watching the stars, sharing a laugh with that new boy that has wormed his way into your head , scrabble !!! ( toity is a weird i tell you ), reading beautiful imagery, attempting yoga and failing miserably, the feeling of freshly shaven legs, pampering myself with a new body lotion or painting my toe nails a vibrant red, feeling the sand in between my toes at the beach, running through corn fields, lying under the stars, looking out over the lake and knowing i live in a beautiful area , a friends hug , the butterflies in  your stomach with a new infatuation, the caress of someones hand over your cheek , traditions, picking up a pencil and sketching, knowing that some people are there for you no matter what, seeing the clouds in the sky and picking out images,wild monkey sex :P , pillow fights, teenage mutant ninja turtles and old school toys, getting my hands into anything...paint, clay, pastry, breads ... feeling sexy in new underwear, going to the movies with a best friend and being the only ones in the theatre , skipping, vibrant colors, where's waldo , finding something i havent' seen in years, Christmas morning... knowing that everyday will bring something else beautiful even on the hardest of days....."

 frick it.. i am trying to talk about memory burns.. you know.. those random tidbits that pop up from the distant past every so often .. but i just can't do it.. I could have written 500 of them last night, but today my mind is else where.. instead of the many many memories of my distant past, its focused on whats going on now.. what is that you ask ? i'll tell you ... the ineptitude of the male species when it comes to trying to understand women .. and in particular me .. I never would have thought it would be so complex for them, i mean i am a fairly simple creature ! treat me with a bit of respect and i am a happy camper.. tell me that you want certain things and then go for another and you're just going to piss me off..you would think that would be a fairly simple concept to grasp .. but apparently not. why can't i seem to find people to talk to that are honest about their intentions ? ha ! because the only ones that are like that are little children who haven't learnt how to be deceptive purely for their own benefit. If you want a quick bang and never talk to me again .. tell me .. at least be upfront about it so that i can deal with it... or better yet.. don't come near me .. because i am tired of dealing with men who can only think with their penis. If you meet me and decide you don't like what you see , i couldn't care less - thats your deal ... but don't you dare tell me that you want to see me again and then  skirt around the issue when i call you on it. Don't play games like children folks.. Its time to grow up.  And no this journal entry is not about one specific person in the least.. its about the problem in general ... in talking to my girls i am finding more and more often that the guys they find themselves attracted to and the boys they find are attracted to them  are truly deceitful pricks. I am sure there are some good ones out there... but fuck .. they're all gay .. and if they say they're not.. they're lying.
 wow .. that sounded really nasty and hatred filled towards men .. but its not really .. i am just frustrated in general .. and guys seem to be the easiest target right at the moment.. easier to vent about them than it is to find a tub of ben and jerrys cherry garica"

All i can say about my experiences behind the wheel thus far is this ..... i hate standards.. stalling is easier than driving. 
 moving on ... So i realized today that .. well the summer is starting to get on, and i hadn't heard from school ( CTC ) about my summer course that i am to start soon. So i figured well i should probably have a look through my papers and give the school a call to find out when i would be receiving all my course material and all that jazz.. i was soo friggin lucky that i decided to do that when i did, because the first sheet of information from the school that i managed to pick up , was a letter detailing how my first meeting with the instructor was today.. at 3 30 ..  SOOOOooooo incredibly lucky !! someone was looking out for me today lol."

Tomorrow is rachels death date.. perhaps that is adding to it.. it will be 9 years tomorrow since my sister died.. strange... it doesn't feel that long ago .. but then again i don't suppose it ever will.
 Because of my nostalgic mood i decided to clean out my room , msn list, clothes, and well .. just parts of me that i don't want anymore :P all in all ... today is definately a truro day .. a day when my mind is no longer in ontario but back in NS as a little girl.. 
 While cleaning out my room , i found seemingly endless scraps of paper with phone number scribbled over them .. lol i should start calling them jsut to see who they are, and to hear their reaction to me calling .. not knowing who they are..ahh crap .. i ahve to go .. i will try and write more later"

"event","Ok , so its been awhile since i last updated.. the reason being that my computer decided yet again to go wonky on me , and didn't want to let me onto a select few websites.. livejournal being one of them.
 so whats new in my life you ask ? well probably you don't ask, but i am going to tell you anyway..To start with I have had a seemingly endless number of doctor appointments in the past couple weeks in attempt to get all my vaccinations under way for my college program, and more importantly in trying to figure out what the heck is wrong with me ( its proven i am a sick and twisted individual .. yes you probably already knew that) .. For the past well ... long time i have been having hot flashes like a menopausal woman , along with a practical treasure chest full of other likewise lovely symptoms, and the doctors have never figured out what was causing my wonkines.. i mean you are reading the journal of a girl who had high blood pressure at 8. On  and off for the past lord knows how many years I have had tons of different tests to try and unearth  whats going on with me.. the blood tests almost always come back perfectly normal however.. After a  really bad hot flash i decided it was time to attempt to get the doctors to help me yet again..I called  to get an appointment and loe and behold they had one... a for two months later.. i took it anyway.. wow .. what a lot of needless explanation. To make a long story short, after having 15 tubes of blood snafued from me , it comes back that i am in fact turning into an old lady and have very low estrogen.. which makes no sense whatsoever as i am on the pill and if anything my estrogen should be high .. unless my body is making absolutely none !  on top of my lack of estrogen i have very high insulin.. and the doctor has no clue what is going on with me.. sooooo i get to go to a specialist .. whoo fricking hoo... actually  i am pretty happy about it ... to know that my symptons are not just figments of my imagination , and to know that someone is actually going to look into whats really going on with my body .. ( haha wow that could sound really kinky eh ) . 
  Tonight i hung out with krystal !! lol it had been friggin ages since i had last seen her... february i think ... because we were both rather sleepy ladies, we just went over to the plaza and chatted over ice cream and coffee.was wonderful to catch up .. bahh computer isn't working.. i will finish updating later"

I don't think that with my personality and habit of becoming obbessed with things that i should have joined lol.. oh well .. but as i was trying to do up an ""about me "" thingy  , I just couldn't figure out what to say ( which is unusual for me.. i mean i am always talking !! ) , so i took a page from lauras book and wrote random bits of information about me.. This got me to thinking that I really haven't done that in my journal .. the only thing i tend to write about are my daily goings on .. not about me.. not about what i think , feel , like, love, dislike, loathe... my pet peeves.. what makes me tick , my weaknesses , my strengths , what i am scared of , what makes me brave .. how strong i can be and how fragile all at the same time and whats made me that way. With this journal I tend to write about certain things..so you don't get a true vision of me.. so i am going to do another blurb of tidbits of useless information about me... 
 Before I get into that  i just need to honor someone... Today should have been my sisters 27 th birthday, instead she is 18 in my heart forever. 
 ~ Rachel Dawn Verdurmen   May 29th 1978 - June 22nd 1996 ~ 
 Dear Rachel , 
 I don't know if you are watching over me as i write with tears in my eyes on what should have been a family and friend filled day. all i can hope is that you are there and you know how much i love you  this day.. my heart aches when I think of all you missed out on in life. I remember thinking that when you died you were so old and mature... but that was through the eyes of an 11 year old child who was desparately missing her sister.. today looking through the eyes of a 20 year old woman who desparately misses her sister, all i can think is that you were so young, that you were cheated out of so much, but not only were you cheated of life, our family was cheated out of the chance of seeing you grow and experience what that life had to offer.. I miss you rachel, I want so much for an older sister to turn to , to talk about the heart breaks i have had, to talk about the frustration that arises from men, to talk about love and life , to share secrets, to argue with over silly things and make up a few days later over chocolate ... someone who i could go with anything to. I want you to know that i looked up to you with all the admiration an 11 year old could, you were everything I wanted to be.. perfect in my eyes ( except when you wouldn't let me hang out with you lol ), now i know of course you had your faults too ... but i still look to your memory with admiration and love. Happy 27th birthday Rach .. i look forward to the day when we meet again. love your sister sarah . 

  phew with the emotional stuff out of the way, and my stuffed up nose from crying cleared, and my eyes raw from crying recovered  i'll move on to the tidbits of information about me.. As you may have guessed from that I am sentimental and show it. I cry easily and i get over it easily. I put on a strong front and have a very fragile core. I love easily and with all my heart. hmm will do this part later.. my mind is not in the right setting"

Yesterday I ended up going out to dinner with laura whitley ( after much debating over where to go .. as we are quite possibly the most indecisive people in the world..put us together and we're screwed ... and not in the good way so don't get that thought in your head :P ) , and then over to port dalhousie.. I can say with complete honesty that Port has got to be one of my favorite places to just wander around... even though it has such a touristy atmosphere there is something about it that enthralls me. Maybe its the whimsy of being able to ride on a coney island style caroseol for a mere 5 cents, maybe its the summery feeling that you get as you walk down the pier with an old fashioned ice cream in your hand ( or in my case... down my shirt).. or hell .. maybe its the boys of summer that you see down on the beach playing volleyball... hmm thats definately a possibility :p jks. Anyway  after port ,laur and i ended up at charles daley park .. and yeah we totally interrupted some couples make out session down on the beach.. haha suckers :P .. and from there back to my place for some chilling and chatting... definately good times :) .. looking forward to doing that again
  a few random tidbits of information before i leave... my dad has been diagnosed with high cholesterol .. good bye yummy dinners. hello salad... , my bosses wife has the iq of a post, my boss seems to be trying to set me up with an old neighbour and has informed me that one of the girls i work with needs to loosen up and that it would be good if "" she got a good lay "", and lastly.. i have had my breasts fondled by a japanese worker at my job who told me that my boobs were ""big and soft"" whereas hers were small ... ahhh the daily happenings of me ."

"event","Yah so its been practically a month since i have written on here.. Lol its doubtful that anyone noticed so its not such a big deal anyway .. I have just started writing in an actual pen and paper journal recently .. gives me a bit more freedom.. its easy to sit and veg  with my pen and paper in hand... easier than it is to try and convince my computer to be a doll and work for me.
 Not too much has really changed in the past month .. have had my good times and my bad times... lol maybe more bad than good.. but thats besides the point. The biggest high point of my month definately was finding out that I had been accepted to the CTC for the fall start. I am soo super pumped about getting in.. and being able to feel somewhat productive again.. working at a candy factory ( as amusing as it can be ) is not exactly stimulation for the brain ( maybe it is for some.. perhaps the annoying girl that works there who seems to have the mental capacity of an anteater .. no make that an ant ).
 I could write about the negative shit that has happened , like having slept with someone never to hear from them again , my self confidence being shattered when my mother compared me to someone that looked like shamu the whale, having a crazy guy propose to me after only 2 dates and having to slap him for trying to feel me up while my family was around, among many other lovely things such as that .. instead I am going to write about the good.. the return of my friends from university is the big one !!!
 So at first it didn't seem like anyone would be home this summer.. thought everyone would be away for work and such  .. but turns out a few more are staying back than  had been the original plan .. Now both Krystal and Cara are going to be aroun.. both of whom were supposed to be in waterloo over the summer.. yay !! So for the summer these are the ladies : Hez, Rach, Sondra, krystal, cara, Laura W, Laura K and jordan B :)  Good times ahead. My tirsh is still gone.. but i did get tosee her before she went away ! yay ! Along with the old friends, I am coming to find that I am getting to know and appreciate new ones too ( parker among many others ).  ack .. time is flying.. i will write mor elater this evening .."

"event","I am determined to actually write out an entry that I have been meaning to for the past month. So how often do we actually take the time to tell people what they mean to us ? I've come to realize that i really don't do it as often as i should.. and honestly i am sure there are people out there who have no idea that they've had an effect on me, or the way i live my life. Its amazing how much a simple action can imact a person , or affect the way they view you , and most of the time you don't even realize it. The reason i got to thinking about this was that I had a customer come into avondale and we ended up hanging out ( note .. this was crazy wiccan fellow mentioned in previous entries, but that doesn't have bearing on the point i am trying to make), and he had told me how much he respected me , because he had watched me deal with many tough customers in the past, and how i had always been so friendly to him whereas other people would tend to ignore him.. he mentioned how he came in one day about a year ago and said he was having a rough day when i aske dhow  he was, and apparently he said that no point in complaining because no one would listen .. supposedly i answered that that wasn;t true, and that i would listen .. (i don't remember this ). He was telling me how from that point on he had wanted to take me on a date and often thought about me, and wanted to get to know me ( sounds stalkerish to write it out, but it seemed nice when he said it).. I was completely oblivious to all this... funny how things work eh . So i decided that i am going to try and make the effort to let people know what they mean to me.. and i am going to start by writing some of it out here..Each entry i will put in a person or two that matters to me.. and because i have been thinking and praying for desarai so much .. I am going to start with her.
 Desarai - I Love you plain and simple.. No matter what we have gone through i know that we will always be there for each other when we need it most. I have known you the longest of any of my friends ( haha family excluded )and we have watched each other grow up and mature into very different women from the girls we were when we met.You have helped make me the person I am today. I need you to know that I will always cherish the times we had together... good and bad, and that i look forward to the future with a smile for you and baby to be. For your baby i pray that he or she gets to experience something like we have. nothing could ever replace the friendship that we have had , and i can only hope that baby will have the joys of the same.. You will make a caring and loving mom des .. i am always here for you and yours.
  well i doubt that this is a very effective method of showing ppl how i think about them .. but figured it was a start.. haha at the same time.. maybe its a good idea to keep some of it in a journal .. i mean there are some people who have hurt me so badly in the past that have helped mould the person i am today , and i don't think that it would be such a great idea if i were to tell them what they mean to me.. because as much as they have helped me grow.. i would still be tempted to smack them upside the head.. hard... with a shoe. 
 Anywho .. i do amazingly have some other stuff to write about, as i have been incredibly lax with this journal lately .. Not that i don't want to write.. but whenever i sit down to  actually say something, nothing comes out.. my mind goes blank ( haha although this is not unusual ) .. 
 so to begin with .. I have a new job .. I think i may have mentioned this in other entries.. but i am going to say it again.. I make cotton candy ! (and soon to start with candy apples).I found the job ad on jobgym.com ( a godsend to bums like me ;P ). The job is actually really pretty good for what it is.. I mean its standing 8 hours in the same spot pretty much .. packing cotton candy into tubs and putting them on a conveyer belt.. But its 8 dollars an hour, the boss is amazing, hours are whatever works for both me and the boss .. and free cotton candy ( haha i am going to be massive by the time i am finished there ) 
 haha speaking of massive.. So sarah's freak factor has proven infalable  (sp?)yet again. I ended up having a new ( and very yummylooking ) fellow added to my msn , and we got to chatting.. he was a lovely man, possessing all the qualities that i would look for in a guy ( mind you i am not looking ;) ) , until he mentioned how he is into very very large women , and into ""feeding"" , aka making women fat, because watching a woman increase in size is a turn on for him .. Now i have no problem with BBW , because well i am one.. i am no skinny minny by any stretch of the imagination, however its beyond me how it could be erotic for someone to ""feed"" anothr person  and watch them become extremely obese .. i am a magnet for oddities.. although i suppose everyone has something strange about them .. but wow.. i manage to pick up on the really really weird fetishes. 
 Well going along with the theme of fat, I have basically given up on the gym.. so now i need to get back to it.. its been like 2 months.. i know why it is.. whenever i get into an emotional funk i avoid the gym , and tend to mope around the house.. and well the past two months have been an emotional roller coaster for me ( for several reasons). I have noticed my weight slowly creeping back up and i hate feeling like that. So the past few days i have started taking my anti anxieties ( which also have the lovely side effect of helping with weight loss) again , and bumped up my water intake again.. i will get it to the point where i am back at 3 litres a day .. even if my bladder will hate me for the first little while. I have also found myself a work out buddy for the summer. yay for my jen !! planning on doing lots of outdoor kinda stuff.. I absolutely adore hiking, but i don't do it on my own , so this will be an awesome chance to explore more of the bruce trail. Hopefully i can make it stick this time.. damn emotions throwing me off track ..

"event","Wow so I have been crazy slack in writing in this sucker of a journal recently.. Which is so strange considering i have actually had things to write about( haha albeit they are not very interesting ). 
 First and foremost.. I have my application in the mail to my college.. hoping to hear back soon !!! I am pretty stressedabout it .. not knowing whether or not i will get in kills me.. and as most of you know, i am not exactly a patient person when it comes to certain thigns.. this is one of them !I can't wait to know :) 
 Next... I got a job ! and quit the bastard of a place named avondale... for the 4th and final time lol . I am now a cotton candy queen .. I am working at a place called moyer farms in vineland.. its not so bad at all ..My first shift i thought it was hell , but it definately has its perks.. I mean who can resist free cotton candy lol.. Haha when i went in for my interview i was hit with the sweet scent of fresh cotton candy.. it took me right back to my days wandering around the provincial ex in the summer time.. Funny how certain scents can transport you back to places deep in your memory eh . oooh i jsut got a call .. i have to go have a shower and get makeupified.. will be back later"

I didn't think anything about giving out my email addy, because i mean what is so dangerous about that right ? wrong.. my main email is my first and last name.. Soo one of the guys that added me decided that he would do a canada 411 search and find out what my phone number was.. along with my town and street address.. Needless to say it scared the shit out of me when he asked me if i lived at ---- of my street.. But it didn;t seem to phase him.. I mean he is a lovely person , and i am sure he wouldn't do anything.. but the fact of the matter is that i didn;t realize how easily accesibly all my information was.. fuck i am  very naive for a person with such a cynical streak .
 Anyway .. new subject. that one just scares me too much .. crazy to think how easy it is to find someone .. the internet is not as annonymous as one would be led to believe. So i have definately crossed the line of enjoying underwear and being an addict.. damn lasenza and their amazing sales... resulting in mass amounts of underwear being bought by me.. 14 pairs in one day is a tad excessive i suppose.. Hahah my newest paycheck went to my nails, clothes, underwear, teddies, chocolate and chick flicks.. dear lord i am turning into a girly girl .. whats happening to me haha ! actually i still have some money left so its all good.. then its down to saving like mad for the fall..   I still haven't heard back from movie gallery .. so thinking i may not have gotten the job .. oh well .. it would have been nice to have but not a big deal if i don't get it.. i still have avondale to keep me occupied until i can find something more profitable. wow .. falling asleep .. and its only 11 15.. i guess i will try writing some more another day... when my brain actually wants to function ;)"

"event","I was informed today by my mother that i really do attract freaks.. how sad is it when even your mother notices your dismal dating history ? I was worried  recently , how after one date a fellow informed me that his grandmother wanted to meet me.. Now this is not to say that i don;t want to meet the woman ( ok maybe it is), nor is it to say that that i am terrified of any form of commitment ... but man thats moving fast !!! and it gets better .. not only had he told his family about me, but he told all his weird comic book store friends about me as well.. so they decided to pop into avondale (while i was working nonetheless ) and proceed to ask if "" oh you must be charlies girl , did you have a good date ?"" and invite me to play dungeons and dragons with them. Now i admit that i may have led him on accidently by agreeing to hang out with him .. however i tried to fix this by telling him recently that i am not ready to be in a relationship of any nature, and i certainly don't want to be having sex with him or anyone else for that matter before i am in a solid relationship... Oh but this did not go over all that well.. nope with my luck i discovered that no i was not hanging out with a human .. i was in fact hanging out with a brick wall .. i could not convince him for the life of me of what i was trying to explain .. i gave up trying after he accused me of bullshitting him and myself, and told me that i did want to be swept off my feet and that i do believe in him, and the possibility of more betwen us ( meanwhile i have no attraction to him physically whatsoever). the fact that he also informed me that he was wiccan, could cast spells , and therefore should give him a chance just topped it off. One word to describe it all .. infuriating"

I am really really hoping that i get this job , even though it seems kind of silly and a juvenile type of job.. but it would mean being away from avondale ... lol plus i mean  think about all the people that you would get to check out working at a video store :P jk ..somehow i don't think that would be appropriate for my interview...

"event","Friends turning out to be psychotic murderers who won't die, mass amounts of candy, people i have not seen in ages getting married , snow forts the size of mansions, and of course sleeping with 3 men at the same time.. man i have some frigged up dreams ... Its really quite odd what people do in their dreams.. I honestly don't know that its a form of unconscious expression, i tend to think it is more often than not a jumbled up story created from the deepest thoughts ( or not so deep at all ) that have entered our minds that day. Mhmmm i wonder what my dream dictionary would say about my psyche if  i were to look up all the random things that i dream about.. in fact ... i think i will ..  Just as i thought.. i am a fucked up critter ;) 
 So aside from having wonky dreams, last night was really good .. My day started off with Rachel stopping by and deciding to go on a hike up on the escarpment for old times sakes .. Going up and re living the days of stop sign molestation, getting lost on the trails, and of course some issues with cameras.. And of course had to throw in some typical sarah moments .. walking through the mud in pajama pants hiked up to my knees with unshaven legs... its hot ;)   .. In the evening i got a call from trish and jen .  Trish stopped by to pick me up for a movie night at her place with jen and a few others.. It was really good to see people !!!  But.. i found out that Trish is not going to be in the g spot at all this summer.. She is working at a resort up north as a waitress and living in residence there. Jen and i have made plans to do some road trips to go see her , but with work and such i know that it won't really be possible to do that sort of thing with any regularity. I am even wondering whether or not i will be able to go out east.. I hope that i will be able to .. but i am honestly not sure how it will work out... Although i have slowly been realizing that there aren't that many people that i feel its a necessity to see out there. I mean i will always love my friends from NS .. but as the years go by i am slowly losing my ties to some of them. It was bound to happen at some point though .. I mean i have lived here for almost 5 years now.. Its scary how fast it has gone by ..Everything is changing so quickly..... ahh work calls.. i will ramble more later"

"event","So i have had my week of junk food, lounging in bed, crying over random things, not doing a damn thing.. now its time to get back into the routine of being me again. Meaning .. eating junk food , lounging in bed and crying over random things.. haha nah joking of course.. I am going to get back into the swing of things.. finish up  my application to college ( that letter telling the college why i think i would be a good applicant is the only thing left.. and its hanging over my head like the sword of Damocles ), send out some more resumes.. and yes.. back to the gym ... augg .. not looking forward to that one.. Its not so much the working out that i am not looking forward to.. because i love it.. its the getting bitched at by the women that work there at the gym . haha they scare me. Maybe i should just bitch back :P
 I don't think its really in my nature to be an overt bitch though .. haha my bitchiness is veiled with excruciating politeness... with a biting edge to it. I think generally when i am really hurt or angry  I tend to allow my sarcastic wit to come out.. really should work on that lol.. haha the sad part is that most often the people tht hurt me or piss me off don't really tend to have the ability to catch on to the subtle ( well to them subtle )jabs.. but it makes me feel better haha .  Anyway .. i am rambling about stupidness yet again. 
 hmm i haven't really written much about very typical sarah happenings recently .. lol ohhh but do i have one for you ! So the other morning at about 7 , i get shaken awake by my mom ... whispering "" I need your help with a situation "" Rolling over a little bit too far i find my panty clad ass on the floor tangled up in blankets , my shirt twisted half way around my back ( my boob practically hanging out ),  my hair that had been in a nice neat bun when i went to bed, was now hanging on one side of my head like one of those bad 80's side ponytails with hair, added to the fact there were random pieces of hair stuck to my lips. Needless to say not so attractive. THinkng my mom was in dire need of help with some urgent situation i crawl forward on my hands and knees.. draggin myself to a  standing position so i can  run up the stairs to help .. turns out that no my mom did not need help with something that seemed difficult .. She needed me to help her catch claire ( now named lola .. our newest addition to zoo verdurmen .. a cat that has been stabbd in the eye, and abused in the past... a cat with nails like talons and teeth like daggers , and a nasty tendancy to hiss and spit like a cobra when approached). Lola had been living in our guest bedroom for the previous week .. hiding under the bed, not entirely sure she wanted to be adopted by us.. ok .. definately pissed off that she had been adopted .. Now normally this wouldn't be such a problem , i mean its not that hard to deal with a hissing cat under your guest bed right ? it can;t be that hard to sleep knowing there is a vicious cat underneath.. ( actually just terrified the poor critter ). UNfortunately Lola had an appointment at the vet to have stitches taken out from her recent spaying. So this meant that lola had to come out from under the bed and be coaxed into a kennel so we could get her there... Ha for such a small friggin cat she put up a huge fight.. an hour later we were in the room moving the bed back and forth , using a broom trying to sweep her out from her hiding spot.. both my mom and i wearing leather gloves trying to catch her .. i think that was one of the few times i have heard my mom use the word fuck so many times in succession.. haha dealing with teenagers and a grouchy husband is no problem, but throw a nasty cat int he mix and my mom cracks ! by now i am regretting not sleeping in pajama pants for fear of this cat attacking my bare legs in retaliation. At this point the cat flys out from under a desk running across the top of the bed, and deciding she had a thing against our potted ferns that were in stands by the window , takes them out systematically, sending soil and bits of green leaves everywhere.. all i hear is ""that bitch is going down ""  and  look up to have my mom toss a blanket at me , telling me that she was going to use the broom and try to push her out from underneath the bed ( she went back after knocking all the plants over )  and that i was to toss the blanket on her .. finally . finally it worked ! .. Funny how my moms protectiveness of her plants pushed us to the point where we were able to get the damn cat..  Now after the vet appt .. mom decided that the guest bedroom was nto an appropriate place for lol .. seeing as there are too many places to hide.. I now have a half blind vicious cat in my bathroom.. it scares me"

"event","Ever feel like you have been sucked up into a giant tornado , spun around with the cows and trailer homes that have been collected, and then dumped on your ass in the same damn spot that you were to begin with ? No ? well i certainly feel like thats whats happened with me. I am honestly on the verge of digging out the ben and jerrys, chocolate bars, chips , and yes even bring out the frozen juice concentrate that i have hidden in the freezer for moments like this .. when i need to freeze my brain , and yes add to the fat on my ass simultaneously. 
  I haven't really been in a funk as bad as this in awhile... Its been so long.. even though i have had some positive stuff going on in my life recently , i can't seem to get past the negative.. I know that its my obssesive personality that makes it so hard for me.. i focus on my mistakes and can't seem to get them out of my head. And lately i only seem to be making mistakes .. especially when it comes to guys and sexual stuff. I find myself doing things only to regret them later .. doing it for the few minutes that it makes me feel like a normal human being, someone that can attract other people, that can be found erotic, beautiful , cared for ... when in reality i know that all the physical is for the guy is... well an easy blowjob or piece of ass, purely physical. This being said... there are exceptions to every rule.. however i have not encountered many exceptions to this one .. one or two at most. So that has really been weighing on me recently.. amid a barrage of other things. 
 The main thing the past few days has been the loss of a person i called a friend, someone who .. yes i admit i slept with, someone who i had and continue to have complex feelings for. Parts of my feelings arise from ego . I mean the fact of the matter is that he chose someone else over me.. and of course that would bruise anyone's ego .. i mean who likes to be second best? or in this case.. the most convenient at the time ? That happened awhile back tho , and i was fine with it ( well as fine as i could be with a self image that was already in shards ), understanding the important role that the past plays into the present , and in this case his past with a friend playing into his now present with her as a gf. however.. on with the story .. so him and i still kept in contact via msn ( lovely tool that it is .. on a side note i am trying to avoid it for the next few months ).. and decided that we would get together and just chill and watch a movie, because we are mature adults who can still be friends. ha ! still be friends my ass. so movie was going fine.. until we ended up kissing...  Now .. way to totally send a girl mixed signals.. I felt like a royal bag of shit afterwards..and apparently he must have too , because later in the evening he informed me that he wouldn;t be able to talk to me anymore.. well that is definately one way to cause me to bring out the bad food.. he said maybe in a month or two we could take each other off blcok on msn and try to be friends again, but that we needed to get each other out of our systems.. which i think is very wise.. but it doesn;t mean that its not going to hurt like hell not to be able to tlak to someone i called a friend .  but it is now 4 in the morning and i need sleep .. i will finish this up tomorrow"

"event","The gym is calling my name.. and i really don't want to listen .. it feels like it has been ages since i have last gone.. i keep making excuses as to why i am not going, from being sore, sick , in a bad mood because of stupid stuff that was going on , saying to myself i will go in the morning instead ( obviously that never happens .. i am not a fan of the morning ) .. So i have to get back at it.. I know that when i go in i am gonna end up bitched at by the women that work there.. guh .. i think that is bugging me more than actually going in..I don't mind working out, but i don't want to be talked to while i am doing it.. haha maybe that makes me bitchy.. but i just get more into it when i am on my own and not paying attention to anything else. For that reason i probably should have joined a regular gym and not curves, but i love that its women only. But its a new month .. a new start, new chance to get my ass in gear lol.
  Everyone was home for reading week recently.. it was great to see people again, really looking forward to the summer now !( haha for several reasons ... mmm guys with no shirts.. gotta love it ). I was talking to my girl jill recently about how i am most likely gonna end up back out east again for a visit this summer. I am not too sure how long i will go for this year though, I am finding with each visit that there aren't as many people that i feel i need to spend a lot of time with. Seeing Jilly will be awesome though , always soo much fun. haha this time i will try not to spend as much time drunk as i did the last summer... but i can't promise anything !Looking forward to getting to the beach again.. i miss it so much.. as pretty as the lakes can be they don't compare to the sea.. feeling the tide pull you and waves push you... man you know you don't have much to say when you start writing about shit like that... hmm i am gonna grab supper and then maybe tonight come back .. and write about how i have managed to find myself back at avondale :P"

"event","My journal is incredibly boring or so i have been told , so i am thinking that i may take the link off from my msn profile.. i mean god forbid i bore someone with the mundanity of my life.. this however came from someone with the personality of homo erectus ( also his personality bore a resemblance to the name.. apparently he thought only with his penis ). He did not take into account what exactly the definition of a journal is.. its for personal entertainment only.. not others.. what a dink. Its not so much that, that bothered me about him ( i mean you can't blame a person for his ineptitude), it was his whole persona ( or lack thereof ) ( wow i am sounding bitter haha ). Haha  I have the feeling that i pissed him off with how bitchy i got to be with him and quite honestly i am glad. He caught me on a bad day.. a day where i was definately not in the mood to be able to put up with dickheads whose first remark to me  is to tell me to put on my webcam ( without even introducing himself ) , and then to tell me to finger myself and show him my ""titties""  .. now thats  real class for you. After telling him i didn't get with random people he seemed to be quite offended.. ha funny how i knew  the following about him ;  i was guessing at his name, he didn;t even introduce himself, he was 20 , he lived in the uk .. and i quote "" had a hard on "" ,  but nooooo that should be more than enough to consider him more than a random online . My god some people need to get a clue ! or remove their head from their ass.. either works. 
 Not surprisingly at the same time i had another request to be a skuz ball on my cam, this time from someone i thought had a bit more tact, however i was mistaken .. Maybe it was because this guy was with his friend .. after them asking to see stuff i guess i got a little bit sarcastic and told them to ask their kinky wife to do it if they wanted to see some tits ( maybe that embarassed him in front of his friend because they quickly went offline), and that i was not a piece of ass or a toy to fuck around with. Oh well whats one more person who has blocked me ? haha i certainly don't feel like wasting my time with dickheads.
 well i'm out of tea and out of things to talk about. Whats the point of going on and on about the many assholes out there.."

"event","After getting extraordinarily frustrated with the niagara regional police in Grimsby, i decided to trek down to the station today in search of the elusive piece of paper saying i am not a criminal ... It was supposed to take approximately 5 days for it to go through, ha 3 weeks later and here i was with no clearance.  Finally it was in !! apparently it had been for some time, but they couldn't find it ( had been misfiled ), and then they had conveniently forgotten to call when they did find it.. thank god thats over. haha i was about ready to deck the woman at the desk , each time i went in to the station she acted like she had a thorny stem up her bottom that was just itching to be pulled out. Hahah its a good thing i did not hit the inept woman ... the police station is probably not the best place to commit assault, especially when you are looking for a piece of paper saying you have no charges against you.
 Anyway... the point of that whole tirade is that in fact i am not a criminal and i have the paper saying so !! Now i can finally send in my application to school .. just have to type up my letter/statement saying why i want in, and that sucker is in the mail !  
 Hmm actually i think i am going to attempt to do that now.. i'll be back later to write some more possibly"

"event","Well valentines day is here ( although the date on this journal entry says differently ), and yes .. i still hate it as much as ever. Fairly certain that the only tongue i would be getting today would be from a sneak attack from my dog ( granted he could probably kiss better than some guys i know )unfortunately .. lol i can think of someone i would rather be kissing ... but that is unlikely to happen anytime soon. And definately the only flowers i would receive today would be those that i would buy for myself.. sad isn't it. 
 But i did realize today , that i am not alone with having issues with valentines day ( although i had assumed as much prior to this ) , so many people i talked to have said that they can't stand it , tired of being made to feel inadequete for not being in a traditional relationship. blah  lets rub some salt in those wounds ( lol stolen from lance. haha that phrase worked ).
 anyway .. new topic , i have had enough of love and that shit. This weekend wasn;t too shabby at all !  Friday i ended up staying in ( even though i was supposed to go see Grimsbys  plaY withrach ) , because i had  my aunt and uncles over.. joy oh joy .. got to see vicki.. but i was successful in not decking her ( ha i hiberated in my room most of the night ) .. i cannot stand that woman , seeing her sit in my living room smiling and laughing with my family  when i know how badly she took advantage of my mom and basically the entire family when my grandmother died, just makes me want to deck the woman and rip off her fingernails ( daggers that they are ).. She is the type of woman that smiles to your face, and tears you apart the minute you turn your back.  Lol i think i may have insulted her slightly when i made a fuss of my uncle david who came too ( coolest uncle i have.. he definately rocks my world) , and then just said goodbye to her and turned and left.. she said something to my mom about it, but i think secretly mom probably wishes she could do the same thing.  so that was my friday night. staying in and hibernatin while the shedevil known as my aunt was here.. Saturday jonathan and his gf popped by for a visit, which was absolutely awesome .. until i was drunk as a skunk on champagne and rum, although even then it was still good times. Sunday was definately the best though.. got together with jen , and we made dinner and watched some movies with a nice bottle of merlot, it was really great to be able to spend some time with someone.. i definately feel like i am going insane without having a job.. Today i went into the employment centre again for my interview with my counsellor type lady ( she sends out my resume, trys to hook me up with jobs etc), and there are a few jobs that look like they could be promising.. i really hope to get a call back from the arlies wwarehouse .. they are looking for ppl  and its monday - friday 9-5 type deal .. would be perfect.. 40 hours a week and weekends off lol . lol i pray to the work gods to let me get it !"

"event","The bane of my existance is steadfastly approaching... creeping up like fog on a damp night , waiting to engulf and seemingly devour me.. You guessed it... Valentines day .. the bastard of a holiday!( alright maybe that was a bit melodramatic ). Who would have thought that a holiday created by Hallmark in order to boost their sales could have such a profound effect on the sanity of so many people? .. you ask why i use the word sanity ? its quite simple really, who wouldn't go insane when surrounded by meaningless gush about the importance of a lover in your life  when they don't have one?.. In reality though , should there only be one day of the year devoted to showing your love to the people you care about ?  If you care, shouldn't you show that continuously throughout the year ? Instead there are so many people ( both men and women ) who choose only to do those romantic things for their lovers on valentines day ..  a bit of a cop out if you ask me ( although in my mind a box of chocolates , some lingerie and roses and a quick bang before bed  doesn't constitute romance .. it is commercialized to the max ). But only in a very idealistic world would people  all realize this and we wouldn't have the need for a valentines day in some people's minds.. realistically.. it would never happen.  
 Its funny , as much as i protest how valentines day is not meaningful , i still want to be part of it.. still want the quasi romance, the damn box of chocolates and flowers.. told you it was an evil holiday that fucks with your head.
  In all reality , yes i want it , but do i need it ? i think not.. I have been grappling with this concept the past few days since a conversation i had with a friend of mine debating the difference between want and need. In my eyes there definately is a distinction between the two, but see some people tend to confuse the two I have come to realize. As a human being we NEED very few basic elements to live ( food, water, shelter -as science tells us ), but it tends to be the things that we want that allow us to thrive or collapse. now.. is love a want or a need ?  It can seem to cause a person to thrive or collapse (sometimes a mixture of both depending on the circumstance), so you would think that it would be a want, something not necessary to function as human beings  , but something that we desire to have as part of our lives. But.... in studies it has shown that a child who has no physical contact and shown no love by another human being often has a much greater risk of becoming withdrawn, and not develop properly. It actually has a physical effect on a person sometimes even death. So would that become a need ? do we as human beings need love ?"

"event","Haven't written in this in a couple of days.. I just have not had the motivation for a full entry.. Well at least not discussing any of the things that have been/are on my mind.  listened to a good song today .. Its by less than jake.. called the science of selling yourself short.. not too sure why i wanted to write it out.. but i guess in some ways i felt i could identify with parts of it ( lol obviously not all of it though) ..lol it actually is much more catchy and upbeat when they sing it though.. haha not quite as depressed sounding as you would think from the lyrics.

I've come to my senses,
That I've become senseless,
I could give you lessons on how to ruin your friendships,
Every last conviction, I smoked them all away,
I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way,
So I sit and wait and wonder,
Does anyone else feel like me?
Someone so tired of their routines and disappearing self-esteems,
[Chorus:]
I'll sing along,
Yeah with every emergency,
Just sing along,
I'm the king of catastrophies,
I'm so far gone,
That deep down inside I think it's fine by me,
I'm my own worst enemy
I could be an expert on co-dependency,
I could write the best book on underage tragedy,
I've been spending my time at the local liquor store,
I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor,
So I sit and wait and wonder,
Does anyone else feel like me?
I'm so over dosed on apathy burnt out on sympathy
[Chorus]
Let the meaning slip away
Lost my faith in another day,
Self deprication seems okay,
I never thought I'd make it anyway
[Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy [x5]

 I dunno .. i just liked it for some reason. 
   New topic ! lol so i have recently reached the depths of boredom.. I went into a chat room.. Man there are some crazy crazy people out there.. I talked to maybe ( just maybe ) 3  people on this chat room that actually seemed like decent human beings.. Somehow ""hey baby , wanna chat dirty , i have a huge pulsing cock for your sweet ass body "" just doesn't work for me. hmm i don't think long_and_hard ( oh yes that was this fellows nickname lmao ) appreciated it when i replied that i was an 800 beast woman , and i couldn;t wait to crush him with my hairy body. I thought it was funny. However i am assuming from his lack of response that he did not. It was an interesting experience nonetheless.. haha not one that i care to repeat though.. It was pretty crazy .. there were like 13 year old girls skanking it up having cyber sex with old men .. dirty dirty dirty .. as far as i am concerned thats practically pedophilia. 
 On the topic of pedophilia.. I have been following the news recently ( for lack of a better reason.. from boredom ) , and the police have tracked down a hotel that was used for the sexual assault of a young girl ( which was photographed for pedophiliacs onlien ) , by releasing the photos ( digitally altered to remove the child ). Amazingly enough people actually recognized the hotel , from pictures that only had like a wall a chair and a dresser in it.. turned out to be a hotel in disney world.. How scary is that? I really hope they catch the bastard..  I truly think that rapists and child molestors should be put in with the general population in prisons.. Because even other criminals seem to have a code of conduct, and you don't mess with kids or women .. i mean whats one more murder to someone is already in for life ? Do i think its right to kill a person ? of course not, but would i be upset if a serious offender like that got what was coming to them ?  no .. not in the least.. wow i just realized this entry is really quite negative lol .. new topic !
 lol actually not a new topic.. i am going to get ready and head out to the gym.."

Do you honestly think if they weren;t so damn cute, fluffy and blasted cuddly that they would gethomes.. i think not.. people would see them for the devils that they are.. the little bastard has already started chewing... and pooping.. and making noise ! gah !! lol okay maybe its worth it though.. he is so cute and fluffy. and he fell asleep in my arms.. awww ..  so as you may have guessed.. my puppy came home today :) 
 Today was actually a fairly full day.. i woke up at 7 in the morning.. I didn't sleep well last night...

"event","O.K , so i realize that in relationships, friendships with benefits, regular friendships, any kind of interaction between guys and girls, that both parties make mistakes and can be pricks.. But in the last few days I have become soooooo discouraged with guys !! 
 so many girls i know are having issues.. mostly stemming from the fact that people turn out to be so entirely different than what they presented themselves to be. 
 Right at the moment i am about ready to kick a friend of mines ex bf.. I know that i have no right to want to do that, but the thing is he treated her like shit , even if she doesn't realize how bad it might have been .. because as girls we tend to be clouded by love/emotion/chemicals. Whats worse than treating a person like shit, is making them think less of themselves, make them doubt their own worth.  Especially when i can't think of a better, more caring person that this girl. I'm not going to get into what happened with this situation because its in confidence, but the point of me mentioning it was how it tends to happen all around us.. 
 Her and i both had pretty rough days yesterday.. mine for a reason similar.. its all about assholes.. See in my case in a conversation with multiple people involved, out comes some information .. saying that there is video of me in very intimate situations . Was told that it had been filmed without my knowledge.. lovely eh ? Needless to say i ripped into the guy who supposedly did it.. He denies it vehemently , saying that his friends were just fucking around with my head, because they are sadistic bastards ( ok maybe thats not the way he phrased it.. but they are ).  So back to my original point.. people portraying themselves as something they aren;t.. I never would have thought that i couldn't trust him.. Instead he pretty much betrayed every ounce of trust i put in him. Even if he is truthful in saying that there are no tapes, he still kissed and told basically .. fucking bastard.. No reason for anyone else to know about it.. I am sure that he wouldn;t like it if i told details i know about him , let alone tell my friends that i filmed it without him knowing about it or being ok with it. Needless to say yesterday i was in the mood to tell shit about him, let him feel ridiculed.. but i couldn't do it, even though i wanted to deck him and felt he deserved all i could dole out to him , i couldn't do that to a person knowingly.
  You wouldn't believe how upset i was about the whole situation.. like 2 hours of bawling  later i was less upset and more pissed off though. I was really lucky though , i had a few good friends who were around and about to talk to about it.. Even guys couldn't believe it, said that even they thought it was pretty damn low. Lol gotta love guy friends who are lovely and protective. Definately reminded me why i go for the more mature type. Mmm soo much happier with what i have right now. Haha for so many reasons casual dating is working for me . 
 It definately seems like it would be a whole hell of a lot easier to be the guy in stuff.. haha fuck em , screw em and leave em . Lol i am now being a man .. minus the penis , plus some breasts. Works for me. lol actually i just don't think i have it in me to be like that. But i will try for the good of womenkind ! haha if it works , i'll let you know ladies !
 ANywho .. new topic to write about.. lol that one just pisses me off too much. I think it might be evident too .. my mom has been questioning me about my grumpyness ( i didn;t think it was that bad !!! ) , but for some bizarre reason i don;t really feel like telling her about the issue with the taping business.. haha might not go over too well .. you did what ?!?! .. i can imagine the yelling already. Good girls don't get into trouble like that you know :P  .. haha thats obviously not an area of conversation i want to get into with my mom, yah that would be crossing the reasonable mom/daughter conversation line.. there are some thigns that she just does not need to know.... or want to know for that matter.
 Time has been flying by !!! I am gettin my puppy on saturday ! I am super excited about it , yay for cute balls of fluff to call my own. haha only 2 more sleeps. ha and yes i realize i sound like a kid before christmas.. but its even better :P . So its been good in that aspect that time has been going by like crazy.. but it also means that i have to get my ass in gear and make sure that i get my application into the school or i won;t have it in in time.. and yeah that would suck ass  big time. I think i would go insane if i had to have another year of not being in school.. I am just waiting on that darn police clearance.. I finally tracked it down somewhat.. apparently its in st.catharines and they are mailing it to me.  Bahhhhh my mom just walked in to tell me that the place i was hoping to get my CPR certification doesn't do it anymore.. so that means i am going to have to get in touch with the aquatic centre at brock  because i know that they do them ... Or call Hamilton Red Cross.. but Brock is closer.. I just hope they have a program running soon! 
 Hmm so its Thursday already .. hmm that means a friend of mine who is in Cancun will be back soon .. lucky bastard lol ! I want to go to cancun hehe, or really any place warm with a lovely beach and attractive men serving me countless alcoholic drinks as i read a good book ! Paradise.. mmmmmm .. haha throw some chocolate in the equation and it would be like an orgasm over a week. 
 Great big sea is soo rocking my world right now. haha ever since i got that music downloading program earlier in the week, i have had music playing nonstop, and most recently a lot of great big sea. Its really quite amazing how fast they sing ! think.. if they can move their tongues that quickly to sing, they must have extremely happy girlfriends  ( because i am assuming the talent extends to other things as well ).Note to self... date a boy who can sing fast .. haha jk of course. ( well half joking )
 Its funny , as i have been sitting here writing this out, my grumpiness has really pretty much disappated.. Such a good thing ! i actually think i am going to get dressed for the gym and head out.. i haven't been since last week , and well yeah its showing lol"

"event","What was the highlight of my day you ask ? Oh well it was definately doing my 12 year old brothers science fair project. haha the little bastid has it made ! lol this was the second project in ....... 2 days, that I have done for him. Haha i had definately thought i wouldn't see another science fair project since I moved here to ontario and they told me that they didn't have highschool level competitions for science fairs ( yes i know .. i enjoyed them = certified nerd )... apparently i was wrong !
 So as I have written about before, there is all kinds of stuff required for the application to the canadian therapeutic college, one of them being a letter of police clearance. Should be no problem right ? wrong . I should have had it a long time ago , but nooooo the ditz of a woman who did all of my information and was supposed to be handling mine called and left a message to say something about needing my address, and to call her back at a number, but do you think i could make out  damn word of what she was saying ? hmm no.. So because i didn't have the number , i decided i would venture into the police station today to try and track down this elusive article saying that i am in fact.. not a criminal. When i got there, first of all the woman at the desk sitting behind the bullet proof glass saw me come in , and smiled very nicely.. but didn't come to the window for at least 5/10 minutes, instead she sat at her desk sipping back a tim hortons coffee and munching on a sugar glazed donut( oh well at least supporting the economy even though it doesn't look quite professional with a rim of sugar on your lips). So she finally comes over and asks what it is that i am there for... ( through the bulletproof glass .. i mean obviously i am a criminal and enjoy holding weapons of mass destruction in my bra , to pull out on unsuspecting police station secretaries.. strange i didn't last time when they opened the glass window), when i explained to her my situation she was very helpful ... in confusing me more. Apparently she couldn't find the letter saying that i wasn't a criminal, but knew that the problem was that they didn't have my address... interesting considered they had copies of my health card and passport ... both with my address on it. oh well i guess we can't all be brain surgeons. But i did come out of there with a lovely phone number which i am supposed to call tomorrow to track down the woman who left a message on my phone ( that even my mother couldn't figure out what the woman was saying .. very barbieish voice... you know the kind i am tlaking about.. the kind of voice where you are inclined to deck the person attached to the voice just to make it stop... ok maybe thats only me that wants to do that...) So now that i have finished ranting ( its not my fault i am pmsing .. i am allowed to bitch ,if not in person ( i try to refrain from that ), i damn well will in my journal ), The point of that was to explain that.. i still can't send my frickin application in yet !! Please please I pray to the God of inept police officer assistants get that done soooooon so i can apply , and maybe just maybe have something to look forward to ( whoohoo a regular ( somewhat) social life in september ) .
 Woo news ! Ozzy is coming home on saturday ! I am super excited for a cute little ball of fluff to call my own! yaya  ( haha not so excited for the sharp teeth, scratching, and messes  that undoubtedly will be a part of my life until he gets past puppy stage). Lol its funny , i haven't seen my dad as excited about anything like he is for osiris ( ozzy is short for it ) in a realllly long time, him and mom went out to buy all kinds of puppy stuff.. hahahaha and he printed up a picture that he had taken with the digital, of ozzy and mom the last time they went to see him at the breeders ... lol so excited in fact to show me this picture that he decided to bust into my room right after i got out of the shower.. haha he's lucky i grabbed that towel as quickly as i did, or he may have burned his retinas out. Dad"" oops sorry didn;t mean to barge in .. but LOOOOOOOK !!!! puppy !! isnt; he cute"" , Sarah "" yes dad very cute indeed.. may i please have my room so i can put some clothes on ? ""  Dad "" oh ... right okay, but just have another look !! ""  ... definately very excited. So excited in fact that it scares me.
 Well i would write more, but my fingers are so cold that they may just fall off... well that and i really do hear popcorn calling my name.. i promise ! it relaly is, its not in my head !! .. okay maybe it is.. but damnnnnn popcorn is good.. hahaha there are very few things better , but unfortunately i do not have access to that... there is no chocolate in the house.. haha you were thinking sex weren't you , thinking that wow  i bet that perv sarah is thinking that one of the few things that is better than popcorn that she doesn;t have access to.. gotta be sex eh ? wrong ! haha if i wanted it i could find it.. maybe.. hopefully .. ok i lie i probably couldn't , but it was worth a shot to try and convince myself.. chocolate is much more attainable"

"event","""i can't wait to ram you with my 7 inches "" ... wow some guys really know what to say to turn a girl on LOL ! I know that made me crazy hot.. hmm and i wonder why it sometimes seems to be impossible to have an actual conversation with the male species !  Actually though , I did have an awesome conversation wtih someone from hi5 last night.. we talked for quite awhile ( 3 hours !!) , it was really really super refreshing to talk to a guy who had more to talk about than tits and ass ( to put it  crudely).
 At one point during the conversation the fact that i have a link to my journals on my personal profile came up .. He had asked if it bothered me that anyone could read it. Immediately I answered no,  and I have been kind of thnking about it even more, It really doesn't bother me at all. I mean if people were to judge me about what i write in here ( although granted most of it is just gibberish anyway , and all they could dare to presume would be that i am a ditz without much going on upstairs) they are not the type of people who I would really give a damn about what they think. It was interesting to get his view point on things though, lol i didn't realize that any journal i have kept would be to interest of anyone other than myself.. Normally it is just something that I do out of complete boredom. I've definately had more success with this journal than any other that i have attemped.. Most likely because it is online and I can do it while i am doing other things as well.. So its not as much of an effort to actually sit down and write anything. 
 So Jonathan got home this afternoon ! He was supposed to come home thursday or friday , but some of his friends who are in a band just got back from a tour , so he was staying back to party with them instead ( understandably !! i would have too ). I didn't think that I would get to see much of him today because I had had plans with a friend of mine, but as of right now its looking as if thats fallen through. So maybe i will get the chance to go out for drinks with him after all .. And if not I am supposed to see Jen and go to the movie ""in good company"" ( the one with the kid from that 70's show... haha its kinda funny that I would call him a kid when most likely he has me beat by a good 5 years ). It actually looks like a pretty funny movie, unlike most of the crap that has been released into theatres recently... I can't even remember the last movie that i went to the theatre to see !! I think it was with Heather the night we met the chapters guys , but I can't remember what it was ... OHHH i remember now !! it was Bridget Jones diary two !! ( yes i know... sooo incredibly girly .. haha as is the fact that i went to see it twice).. The only reason i remember thats it was that movie we saw was because we had the entire to ourselves .. So unlike the first time i saw it , and there were two massive line ups and a cat fight over butting in line ( dear lord women are scary when they are going to be seeing hugh Grant.. that or they were severly pmsing .. either way its terrifying ).. Hmm i guess my plans have not fallen through after all :)  yay !  Ahhh but that means i need to find something to wear , a very difficult task lol ! 
 so with that i am gonna get going.. gotta find something .. i think if i went naked it might scare the poor guy"

"event","Note to self # 1 : Chicken noodle soup from a can is not as tasty as it would appear on the can  
Note to self # 2 : curbing sarcasm is probably a good thing when talking to certain people.. apparently some guys don't find it funny when you tell them that if they want to see boobs , they should get together with all their male friends and look around the room  and not ask to see yours .
Note to self # 3 : If I have a daughter , at age 13 start keeping her locked in her room, girls this age become hoes 
Note to self # 4 : If I think I won't need a receipt ... keep it , i will need it later 
Note to self # 5 : Making out/being naughty with a guy in your room while your parents/little brother are in the next room is not advisable... especially when you own a squeaky bed.
Note to self # 6 : Disregarding note 5 is acceptable, only if the guy is incredibly yummy and lovely.. or you are just very very hot for some !
Note to self # 7 : As good as chocolate pudding is, it is probably not a very healthy breakfast .
Note to self # 8 : Stay away from the bad boys, as tempting as they are.... look don't touch , okay touch but not for long ;).. use them like they'd use you .. sexual tools only :P 
Note to self # 9 : Remove foot from mouth , try to refrain from putting it back in .. especially around new people. If this happens run in the other direction one legged . 
Note to self # 10 : Buy the book ""he's just not into you "" i need to study up .. lol and stop trying 
Note to self # 11 : Try to remember to stretch after exercising.. might prevent the ouchness i am feeling ... Sore knees suck 
Note to self # 12 : Living vicariously through your friends only works if your friends live vicariously.
Note to self # 13 : Buy more panties, who says 100 pairs is enough ?
Note to self # 14 : Call britt, jill j , jill sulli, des, kendra, sonia, matt, 
..getting behind in calling people is not sooo good. 
 hmm actually i think i will go get started on that right now !"

"event","Who would have thought that balls could be soooo much fun and soo good for you ! certainly not me ! Get your mind out of the gutter you sick people... exercise balls , not the hairy variety that are attached to men :P   I started using the ball since Christmas ( got one from jon )and at the gym and i am sooo loving it.. who would have thought that just bouncing up and down could help you with your abs ( or in my case a lack thereof ) ! Haha and its just plain fun.. yay for bouncing.. ok ok i am amused wayyyyyy too easily .. I am coming to realize this ! 
 Today i haven't really done too much , i am going to write up a letter trying to convince the College to let me into their  sports injury therapy program for september, then the only thing i have left to do is get my cpr and first aid certification.. I am not really sure where i can do it though , i think i might have to look up st. johns ambulance or red cross and see if they offer courses, and when i can take them. Then sending in my application ! I really hope that i get accepted, I don't know what i would do if I wasn't .. I really should come up with a ""just in case"" scenario. The requirements are not strenuous, but I have learned never to ""count your chickens before they're hatched ""so to speak ."

"event","So I have been meaning to write this entry for quite awhile now after consulting with Gill , and agreeing that it just had to be written out for the benefit of women everywhere hahaha.. Haha everytime that we get drunk together and there are guys in the vicinty out come ""THE questions""  .. The questions are question that we have decided are absolutely necessary to know before you sleep with a guy/get involved with a guy .. 
 the top 5 are the most important.. lol i have decided to tack on a few extra things that are nice to know :P 
 1. First and foremost ladies always ( and i stress always ) ask if they drive a taurus , if the answer is yes  ( especially if it is green ) run ( and i repeat RUN ) in the other direction , this is not a boy you want to sleep with ( not even a guy you want to be in the general  vicinity of - for many many reasons  taurus spells trouble ).
 2. If you are considering sleeping with this fellow , it is essential to know the size of what you are going to be dealing with. Now this is not to say that small is bad ( it is all about how you work it ), this is more a question to learn about their personality... its all in how they answer you see. If a guy replies with "" i'm huge baby"" , or with obscene numbers like 8 or 9 inches, most likely this is not a keeper and is full of shit( however on the rare occasion that they admit bashfully that they are bigger than most, you lucked out hunny ). The best answer for this question would be the ""about average i guess.. i haven;t measured "" one.. that definately scores points.
 3. Now because of the 2nd question there is a third that must( MUST ) go along with it. On average how long can they last ? A man that claims to last for 4 hours straight lies or has a plastic penis.. 
 4. oh shit i can't remember the questions.. lol i need to be drunk for this. Ohhh of course i am missing the question that started it all !! Pehaps the most confusing for even the trickiest of guys.. ask if they know where the pieces go :P 
 5. I believe that question number 5 was one that gill and i concocted after having a discussion about my  habit of always going for the same type of guy , so this might not work for all ladies.. I have to ask if they work designing or programming computers.. if they do it is an automatic no.. no repeats of past men. So just subsitute the occupations of your former freaks in there :P 
  okay too tired to go on .. will finsih this up later"

"event","First real snow storm of the year for ontario :)  Lol i have to admit i am not used to this much snow anymore, I mean hell out in NS this would have been nothing ,but here all you hear are complaints about it ! Apparently mom and dad are growing soft with age, lol can't take driving in the snow.. They had gone into st. kitts for a business meeting with aunt carol and uncle robbie , and were supposed to be home by 7ish .. at 10 after still having heard nothing  from them I called Robbies to track them down. However an hour later i picked up the phone to hear them all laughing like fools in the background and my mom telling me that they decided to spend the night because they couldn;t get out of the driveway.. This is actually the first time since i was a child that i can remember both parents being away overnight ( as odd as that sounds).. not that i mind in the least ;) 
 I figured it was easier to let james do what he wanted this evening than to try and force him to go to bed at a reasonable hour ... found him asleep on the floor at 2 30 in the morning covered with an old afghan that the cats like to sleep on !!! Apparently he had fallen asleep while playing nintendo.. So thinking i would be stealthy by picking him up and putting him in my bed I attempted to lift him.. Turns out i am not as strong as I had thought , or twelve year olds weigh a whole lot more than i thought they would. For such a skinny kid he weighs a ton.. i managed to drop him.... yeah not so stealthy sarah .
 So tomorrow i am determined to bring out my gazelle/airwalker thingy  and use that on the days that i can't get to the gym ( curves has such strange hours !! )for some cardio. I did my measurements and all that jazz the other day before pilates and since i have joined the gym i have lost 6 inches over all , so thats pretty good i guess, was a bit disappointed though because they got a new scale and there is a differnce in weight !! lol and not in a friendly way , so my weight is up a bit.. although supposedly with the circuit training its to be expected that your weight will fluctuate and that at the beginning you actually gain some weight because of muscles bulkening up , but eventually it will go back down .. I certainly hope so haha because i might cry if it doesn't :P 
 Because of the snow and the fact that I had to be home to watch over James, today was pretty mundane ( not that most days aren't here in beamsville), so i spent quite a bit of time on and off of msn just chatting with everyone. I spent some time this evening talking to some of my favorite people to talk online with, lol always interesting conversation with those fellows !! who doesn't love a friendly game of truth or dare :P , ahha okay maybe truth or truth .
 Someone told me they loved me tonight.. I don't know what to think"

"event","Whoa its been more than a year since i've last updated my journal! i just dont have that luxury of time anymore to just sit down and start typing about my day. It's been a little over six months since i've started working and i thought i was getting the hang of managing the whole business but i guess i was wrong. apparently my mom thinks that i have yet to learn other stuff relating to the business. 

So here's the thing, for tha past 3 months i've been working, ive been sleeping really late, thus the result of waking up late too. Everyday i wake up around 12 noon, and it's starting to really piss my mom off. honestly , i want to wake up earlier but how can i force myself to sleep when im not the least bit sleepy? it's like forcing yourself to eat when you're full! And she's been on my case about me getting more responsibility, and that just means more work. 

It's not like i dont enjoy working for her, but i hate it when she's in her fickle minded state of mind. Honestly, one minute she would be saying one thing , and the next thing you know she changes it just like that. Even our customers get confused when she's in this state which of course happens every time she's pricing the merchandise bought by our valued clients. And then, she would blame ME, or my sister , or the secretary how come our prices change every so often. It's so irritating how i still cant move since im under her turf. It sucks that i cant even watch my fave shows on tv simply because she's watching. damn it. i want to be independent but i know that if i do that it's goodbye to everything i have right now and i dont think i can handle that yet. 

i just hope she realizes that she's pissing everyone of in our family simply by still trying to control us! i dont care if that's what she experienced during her growing up years, people are more independent now and she should start living with it."

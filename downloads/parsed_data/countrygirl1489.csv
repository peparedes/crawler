"event","This has been one of the worst weeks of my whole damn life. Everything is so fucked up. I am so fucking stupid for going to that party when i KNEW it was a really bad idea. I fucked up..BAD! I lost the one person i care about more than anything. I don't even know why, i think i know, but i'm not sure. I guess i'm just not good enough. I don't feel like i am good enough for anything anymore, yes i know it sounds like i am feeling sorry for myself and i just need to get over it, but it's not that easy. I can't just let the past 10 months of my life go. All i am holding on to is bittersweet memories. right now i feel like i have nothing to live for, but i know i do. I have people that care about me. i just have to keep telling myself that. i'm making myself sound like a suicidal bitch but its not like that. It's just really hard for me to let go of something i care so much about. I really don't think i will ever LET GO. I will die loving him. This pain makes me never want to date again. It makes me sick to my stomach. I fall for the wrong guys. I fall for all the bullshit of I LOVE YOU. Those words mean nothing when coming from a guy. They say they never want to lose you, but yet they break your fucking heart. I just don't understand. It pisses me off. I have problems trusting people and this just makes it worse. I will never believe another guy when he tells me he loves me. They don't know LOVE is. I can't say ALL guys don't know what love is. I know there are some out there that do. Every since i have become single, all the guys i have talked to only want one thing, sex. They are talking to the wrong bitch, i don't give it up."

"event","Little Johnny was 7 years old and like other boys his age rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about 'courting' from the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done. One day he took his question to his mother, who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister
and her boyfriend. This he did. The following morning, Johnny described EVERYTHING to his mother. ""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured 'Sis must be getting sick, because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just the way the doctor would. Except he's not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time 'Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. Finally, I found out what was making them so sick-a big eel ;had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When Sis saw it, she got really scared-her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she's ever seen; I should tell her about the ones down at the lake by our house! Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. After a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like cats- they have nine lives or something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush
it down the toilet."

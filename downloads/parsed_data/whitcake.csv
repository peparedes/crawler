"event","<div>Okay, so here&#39;s this. I&#39;ve never been to a convention before even though I have really wanted to! A lot of stuff would just get in the way. Like unable to pay for gas to get to the con, or not enough money for anything period, or well.. ALOT of stuff. While browsing around, I noticed this Ad for AnimeWorld Chicago, saying that Vic Mignogna would be there! I did all the research on the cost of just going there on the day Vic would be there and yeah the prices were cheaper. I was SO excited!</div>
<div>By the way, AnimeWorld Chicago is a brand new anime convention in Chicago!</div>
<div>I pre-registered, then recently after that, I got my friend Tiffany into anime/manga. : D So she &nbsp;decided to go with me!</div>
<div>We bought her pre-register thing too.</div>
<div>But then we were worried we wouldn&#39;t get his autograph since he is really popular and all..</div>
<div>There was this &#39;VIP Autograph Package&#39; thing. It was 35 bucks each but it made it so you would be first in line for autographs. Only 35 of those. Contemplated for daaaays. But we decided to get one for each of us! Yay!</div>
<div>So tick tock the day for the con finally arrives. We woke up at 3:45AM to leave by 4AM to make it to Chicago by at least 8AM. [Traffic is nil at that hour too. Lol.]</div>
<div>We finally get there, me in my L Death Note shirt &amp; Tiff in my Kyo Fruits Basket hat. :D We got our badges [only with a little trouble. not finding ours for some reason. this is why you always carry the receipts people~!] and our VIP stuff. Which was a shirt that says &#39;I was signed at AnimeWorldChicago&#39;, a Sharpie that says AnimeWorld on it, a nice photo of Vic, and tickets with our number in line for the autograph sessions.&nbsp;</div>
<div>What was my number? Number. 2. I KID YOU NOT! But more on that later. xD;</div>
<div>We walked around for a little, went to the video room after walking. Watched a few episodes of anime then went to the dealers room and bought some yaoi~ [DUN JUDGE MEEEEEEE. xD]</div>
<div>Then left to get in line for Vic&#39;s Q&amp;A panel. We got in and managed to get in the 2nd row from the front. :DD A Mortal Kombat thing happened first. THEN IT WAS VIC TIMEEE.</div>
<div>We all decided to sing him Happy Birthday when he came out since it was his birthday next week. XD! But first he threw us some Gummy Fish he got from Sweden THEN we sang him the song. He was surprised to say the least. &quot;Let&#39;s not mention any numbers, let&#39;s just say I&#39;m..thirtysometfsjdsgnj.&quot; LOL. Oh I got plenty of video of the panel! May post links later when I finally get it uploaded to youtube. May take a while~</div>
<div>SO autograph time. Turned out that..the stage was where he was autographing. I was 2nd to get autographs. &gt;////&gt;; &amp;nd he took two at a time. So I was up there. In front of the hundreds of fans waiting for an autograph LOL OH MY. So I bought a CD that has some songs he sang all remixed and awesome. Then waited for the 1st girl to get done. Once in front of him, I kinda went blank for a second. Asked him to sign my shirt, CD &amp; Ouran High School Host Club case over Tamaki&#39;s part on it. xD When I had asked him if he would sign that Ouran Case, he just seemed so happy rofl. &quot;Of course!&quot; He was more than happy to sign all those. Then I asked if I could get a picture with him. Teehee. He said something along the lines of &quot;Heck yeah!&quot;. And I officially got one, people..a VIC MIGNOGNA HUG. The first picture turned out blurry so he insisted on re-taking it. So another hug for meeee. [Also, when seeing the blurry photo, he took my phone &amp; navigated back the camera screen. Vic used my phone..&lt;3333!] &nbsp;After that, Tiffany was behind me, telling him that I was his #1 fan. Haha! I told him I really enjoy his voice work &amp; acting and he thanked me and gave me ANOTHER hug!</div>
<div>I was so shocked that I actually got to get so clsoe to him. Stfu, I&#39;m a fangirl I know. xD His hugs were so warm! And, shut up shut up, he smelled GOOD. Tiffany can back me up on that. His cologne was a-maz-ing!</div>
<div>I was surprised that he was so nice! I heard that he was such a sweet man but you never really know until you meet him! He appreciates his fans so much and I love that about him. &lt;3&nbsp;</div>
<div>So after that awesome experience, we wandered around the Dealer&#39;s Room and I bought some more stuff. I am now broke LOL.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Overall, the experience of just being there for the last day was FANTASTIC! The staff was super nice and helpful, the panels were organized and everything was just great!</div>
<div>Me &amp; Tiffany are DEF. going back next year for the WHOLE weekend this time! :3</div>
<div>And I leave you with the pic of me &amp; Vic. And the stuff I had signed plus just that pic of Vic in with that stuff. ~&nbsp;<br />

"event","<br /><br />1999 - April 11th, 2011.<br />[1999 being the time they saved him from the streets.]<br />This was a rough one on me.. And Grandma/Grandpa as well as Mom. Woke up to a call from mom saying that they did a surgery on max and found tumors wrapped around his spinal cord and he had a week at most. They decided to put him down today though, because he was suffering.. Grandpa, Gramma and me took him on one last walk, which he would hardly walk. We stopped and put his blanket down and after a while, he sat. After we cried and kissed him a lot, we took him back inside the vet's office. Mom stopped by and Gramma/Grandpa left. They couldn't be here for him being put to sleep..it would have killed them. Me and mom held him and pet him while he was being put to sleep. It was so hard, I&nbsp;could hardly take it. But he passed on silently, a few breaths later, and then we put his favorite blanket on him and the vet's wrapped him in his blanket and put him in a cardboard casket.<br />Me, mom and Matt dug a hole and put him in..and put a few flowers on top. We buried him under his favorite tree in Gramma's backyard.<br /><br />I will upload the pics of where he is buried soon.<br /><br />Max, you were a great dog. I loved dogsitting you, especially when you hopped up on the bed right next to me and slept. You had a long life and you will be severely missed. <u><strong>VERY </strong></u>much.<br />Now, you are in no more pain. Now, you are at peace. We love you, Max.<br /><br />The song<strong> Into The West</strong>, popped into my head, thinking about him. The part where she says, 'Safe in my arms, you're only sleeping' just reminds me of when we were there with him, holding him as he took his last breaths of this world.. Oh Max. We really love you.<br /><br /><em>Why do you weep? What are these tears upon your face? Soon you will see, All of your fears will pass away. Safe in my arms, You're only sleeping. What can you see.. on the horizon? Why do the white gulls call? Across the sea, a pale moon rises. The ships have come to carry you home.</em><br /><br />http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/annielennox/intothewest.html<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[Caitlyn made this pic..thanks so much!]<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/Deppfan77/RIPMaxbyCaitlyn.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y71/Deppfan77/RIPMaxbyCaitlyn.jpg"" /></a>"

"event","<p>We got her on Christmas when I was 9 years old and my bro Logan was 7. Her name was Belle and she was a Boxer. She was the runt puppy of the litter and she was a sweetie. When we moved out of the country and into town, we left her out in the country with my grandparents. Belle liked roaming around so in town woulda been bad for her. Haha I remember she would eat the strangest things. Dead birds, poop, anything. Literally. She was happy and grandpa loved her. First dog he got attached to. She lived a long life and died of old age. <br>You will live on in my heart. <br>Belle~ 1997-2010</p><p><br>~Whit</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

Part of their 'Carnival of Madness' Tour!

Me &amp; Raya went to the State Fair, walked around allll day in that sweltering heat.. but it was worth it in the end when we got to see Shinedown and Chevelle!
Chevelle was good, but the main awesomeness was Shinedown! Their opening was cool! They were all behind a curtain and you could see their shadows while circus music played, then the white curtain was ripped down and they started playing! They all rocked that place! They even played '45'! I literally squealed when they started playing it. &lt;3 The whole concert I&nbsp;screamed so much and sang so much that I&nbsp;doubt I will have a voice tomorrow. xD Shinedown even got a call from Sylvester Stallone one day. He wanted them to make a song for The Expendables! :D He said that he had daughters and if they didn't like it, then he would put Shinedown in his next movie and kill them all, haha! I&nbsp;was planning on seeing that, now I&nbsp;really will! The whole band really played to the fans and showed appreciation. Man, that place was packed. The Lead singer even came up into the bleachers!&nbsp;O.O To make sure we were rockin' just as hard as the most pit was. 8D We were! Even Raya was rockin' hard! Lead singer talked about his grandmother &amp; that she had a love affair with the stars in the sky. Because she said that people never really are gone, they go into the stars. Then played a song and we all put up lighters or cell phones and it was SO pretty!
They also played their song 'Her Name Is Alice' made for the new Alice in Wonderland movie. Coooooooooool.&nbsp; Haha they left the stage and everyone kept cheering even as the lights went off on the stage. They hadn't even played Second Chance yet. We all kept cheering for around 5 minutes and then they came back, and he said how awesome our city was and played 2 more songs! 'Second Chance' &amp;&nbsp;then 'Simple Man'! Aha, but Brent, lead singer, he had this grin on his face when talking to the crowd. &quot;I'm not gonna get up on this stage and pretend to be all badass, you know why? Because you couldn't pry this smile off my face with a crowbar&quot;. :D
ROFL and when he mentioned how God must have had a sense of humor, because &quot;admit it guys, when we stand naked in front of a mirror, we look kinda funny&quot;, but wet on to say how women were such beautiful, perfect creatures. And to forgive guys for messing up sometimes and that they love us. xD&nbsp;And that the next song was for us ladies and on behalf of the men. The song was 'If You Only Knew'. &lt;3

But, before the concert, I bought a bandanna and a CD. The first 200 people to buy the CD got to meet them and have autographs after the show. So, I&nbsp;met them. They. Were. SO. NICE! And even more awesome in person! They wanted to shake everyone's hand before even signing anything. I told them this was my first Shinedown concert and the drummer gave me a high five. Eric, the bass and backup vocals guy, was reading my T-shirt and then laughed and said it was a cool shirt. It was my 'We Dig Chicks at Farm and Home Supply' shirt. xD BUT&nbsp;GOD&nbsp;DAMNIT. I was acting so shy and girly and nervous! All kinda giggly and stuff. x////x Especially when I&nbsp;met the singer! OI! Man! X///X I asked him if he could please autograph the cd to me nd he did. He was so casual, like he was talking to his buddy. I&nbsp;thanked him 'so much!' and he said 'No problem sweetie, thanks for coming to see us.'
omg.
and i got Raya a signed State Fair Schedule. :D I ran outta there saying 'I got this for you!' And she was so happy she kinda screamed. I&nbsp;had them put 'To:&nbsp;Raya' on it.
I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;SHINEDOWN! Keep on rockin'!

Cause I won tickets yesterday. XD
Some comedian named Dan Grueter was the comedian for the night.
and ROFL was he indeed hilarious!
He asked who was from LA and some woman raised her hand, she was born here but moved there. &quot;Oh, that's good. I&nbsp;bet everyone around here was like, 'How'd the Corn God ever let her get away?' &quot; LOLOL.
And some girl told him that she 'jacked off' horses to sell the sperm. HAHAAA! Through the whole night, he played off that. &quot;Huh, horse sperm. LIQUID&nbsp;GOLD!&quot; Omg hahaaa.
He also played off this chick that was getting married &amp; her fiance was working extra at Steak N'&nbsp;Shake to pay for their honeymoon to Indianapolis HA.
He was hilarious.

I'm about to watch the 2 hour special of Deadliest Catch.. and I probably will cry through the whole flipping thing. :'(
He was my favorite captain on the show.. and his death hit me like a ton of bricks. Like Heath Ledger's death. It's one of those things that well.. you like someone so much that you think they'll live forever. You want them to live forever. Despite they're lifestyle that they live, the smoking and stuff..
Rest is peace, Captain Phil Harris. Sail on those calm seas. My prayers go out to his family and friends.

It was awesome, just like the rest. Granted it's not a masterpiece, but it DOESN'T deserve all the hate and flaming that it always gets. :/ Fawk you haters, it's a great series.
THOUGH I&nbsp;was a bit irritated at Samantha and Raya. Towards the end they were pretty chummy, laughing and holding each others' hands at scary parts. Hn. Felt a little left out. Sam sat to the left of Raya and I&nbsp;sat on Raya's right. Shoulllda sat in the middle. Then the second time they did that hand holding crap, I&nbsp;was like, &quot;Um, hello?&quot; and Sam laughed and told Raya to grab my hand too, but I&nbsp;didn't want her to now. They really made me feel pushed out of the 'in group'. Pffft. Lesson learned. Only take person to the movies with you or you'll be ignored.

She basically said a friend was trying to get with her, but she said no because she is trying to figure out herself, to change into someone she wants to be. Blahblahblaaaaaaaaah.
I find it hilarious that only a day or so after we break up she already has someone all over her.&nbsp;:/
But hey, shit happens.
I let my walls down, fall for her, have great times, make great memories..and then in an instant it's all over and she doesn't seem to care that much.
sigh~
And this is why I&nbsp;stayed single for 2 years. Tired of the hurt. The pain. The betrayal.

SHE asked ME out. :/
And I was attracted, so I said YES.
We got to know each other really well. We talked ALOT.

She's been adorably cuddly lately and it's so cute. I can't wait until she's able to come down here to see me. Excited and scared at the same time. Mom and dad will not be easy to convince(for Nikki to live with us for a week or so).

..until it starts really bothering me, that is. :l 
But even then, I&nbsp;hate to bring up anything unpleasant, at the risk of her leaving me.
Like..me wanting her to stop flirting with..anyone. &gt;_&gt; Because it upsets me. Harmless friend flirts, I&nbsp;dun care about. And then there's flirting that may seem harmless to others, but looks serious to me. .____.
So I&nbsp;gave in and told her about my worries. Like how i'm afraid the JERKFUCKTARD Tatsu will scoop her up as soon as me and her have problems. 
And she said what? That he's waiting for someone else and to leave him out of this.
LOLOLOLOLOL.
Funny.. back when he was calling me every cuss word under the sun, she didn't tell HIM to stop. Even I&nbsp;held my tongue before he just kept talking shit about me. Then when I&nbsp;talk shit to him, she tells ME to stop. wtf is that shit? Pisses me off just a littttttttle bit. :/
ANYWAY, she's mad at me. Tsk. Thus being why I&nbsp;don't talk to her about this stuff. I&nbsp;know that she would never do that stuff to me, but I&nbsp;still worry. She lives in Australia for God's sake! A looooooong ways away. I think worrying is normal. .3.

But the unfortunate fact is that you can't go your whole life without upsetting someone. Like her ex, let's call him Tim, is a jerkassholestupidfuckerholycrapdieidiot guy. She has to stand her ground and not give him false hope, like she has in the past. She hasn't, but.. he's doing the guilt trip thing again. &gt;.&gt;;<br /> 'Ohemgee, we can't be close now, cause you're with her.' <br />'Yeah, I&nbsp;know, I know, all I&nbsp;will ever be to you is a friend. It hurts.'<br />Only he typed it like a 2nd grader would.<br />Let me fix those..<br />'omg we cant be clse nao, cuz yer w/her.'<br />'ya i know i know all i will evr b to u is a frend. it hurtssss'<br />Yeah, that's how he types. Because typing out words is simply impossible for some reason.<br />Anyway, he's busy sending her on guilt trips and being just a big ol' asshole, but denies it and makes her believe that he's not. o_O -shakes head-<br />So, I&nbsp;bet it's getting harder for her to stand her ground and not give false hope to him. Understandable, but jeez.<br />He's an ASS.<br />He thinks he has the 'RIGHT' to be with her because he's known her for 4 years and i've only known her for less than 1 year.<br />..And? So? xD<br />Just because I haven't known her as long doesn't mean squat. I&nbsp;love her with all my heart.<br />But it happens. Running into these jerks. &gt;&gt;; Unfortunately, he's her friend. So he'll be around a while.<br />Unless she FINALLY gets tired of his crap. -crosses fingers because I am so sick of the drama he creates-<br />..did I mention one of the reasons&nbsp; he said she should be with him? <br /><strong>&quot;What's a girl got that I&nbsp;don't? With ME you can have a family.&quot;</strong><br />Um LOL. And she can't have one with a girl? This guy's a jealous fucking moron.

He's a 'friend' of my girlfriend. No harm, right?&nbsp;Wrong. He kept calling her names and making her feel guilty and crap like that. And then he turns to me and says I'VE been doing those things. Um, what are you smoking, pal? Oh, and he's a sexist, homophobic pig. o: He thinks 2 girls can't have kids. A family. And the only 'normal' relationship is between a man and a woman. He's just an ass! But of course she doesn't see it. No matter how many examples I give him AND her. :/ He cusses me out and all he gets is a 'if you don't like what she's saying, don't read my comments'. And because I&nbsp;was sick of being cussed out for nothing, I cussed him out, and I get 'Stop posting that stuff to him'. Yeah, real fair. And that dude that is always with her on xbox live. sigh.
There's just a lot of issues.
&amp; i'm not one to wish harm on others, but I really hope a car hits my girlfriends 'friend' so he is paralyzed or something. He just won't give up. But I'll try not to let it bother me. :/ Kinda hard with all the flirting.
Yeaaahhh but I will not let it bother me.

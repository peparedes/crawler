"event","Time to write out how my day has gone so far.

Jaclyn, Athena and I were woken up at around 11 AM by Joey's mother, after having gone to bed three hours beforehand. We go upstairs, and wake Joey, Rio and Michelle up. We hang out in Joey's room. Hanging out consisting of, Joey, Rio and Michelle RPing, and Jaclyn, Athena and I trying not to be sad that Joey's leaving, and watching Legally fucking Blonde. You see, the whole night, we were basically divided into two groups, those who were RPing, and those who weren't. At first, we were all just hanging out in the living room, and half of us were RPing, but it wasn't distracting or anything, we were just - hanging out and having fun. Then, the three that were RPing, started talking about nothing but what was going on in their RPs, leaving the other three of us, totally out in the cold. So Jaclyn, Afeena and I go upstairs, and go on the computer, and harass random people on MSN, out of pure boredom. We were just hanging out in there, knowing that we should go back down, but we didn't want to have to be sitting there completely shut out again, so we just - stayed up there. Then, before we know it, the three come upstairs and kick us out of her room, because they're going to bed. We're just like - ""Oh, okay then."" So, we all go downstairs, and dick around, making a fucking mess for four or five hours, before we end up crashing. So anyways, back to this morning. Slowly, people start leaving, because they have to get home, Athena first, then Rio, leaving Jaclyn, Michelle and I hanging out with Joey in her room. Joey and Michelle are sitting together, all snuggly like and cute, RPing and talking about their RPs, while Jaclyn wrote her goodbye letter to Joey, and I watched Legally Blonde 2. I am trying my hardest not to just burst out crying, I have about two hours left to spend with Joey, to last me for a year and a half, and I'm spending them watching Legally Blonde 2. After a while, Michelle gets up to get changed, and I take her spot. I just wanted to snuggle with her one last time, I just wanted to sit with her. Michelle comes back and starts flippin' out at me to give her her spot back and such. She made me feel guilty for wanting to sit with Joey. 

Fuck, I can't write anymore right now."

Is that long enough to make somebody feel happy inside?

To make them feel that they're loved?

Is five days long enough to plan a party?"

"event","- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real-life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

Step Two

- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

1. I want the Audiobook (or whatever the hell you call them) Girl, Interrupted. So basically, I want a tape of Susanna Kaysen reading aloud her autobiographical book majigger. Yeah.. If that made any sense at all.

2. For somebody to make me something. Doesn't matter what. Could be food, could be a picture of some sort. I just want somebody to make me something that's real, that I can touch, so not something done up on the computer.

3. Somebody to hug me on Christmas day. Somebody that I can cry to without having to explaine that I miss my daddy to them."

"event","Joey and I are talking..

We're talking about going to Europe together when we're older.. Just travelling around, seeing everything, experiencing everything that we wouldn't be if we finished school, went to collage, settled down, had families.. I'm happy. I'm excited. It's weird. I hope that this isn't something we're just going to talk about once then just kind of forget about..

I'm so excited~

England~ Spain~

Before we started talking about this, I never saw any reason in school, jobs, all that jazz. But now, I finally have somethign to look foreward to. I have a plan~ The moment I'm old enough, I'm going to rush out and get a job. I honestly don't give a shit where it is. I'm excited. Really excited.

It's not just going to be a year or so of travelling.. Joey and I.. We plan on continuing like that forever.. Or eventually settling down in Southern Spain or sommat, only after we see everythign, and do everything of course.

Joey says her and I speaking about this is making her happy. I'm glad. I'm so glad..

We can make this work..

If you believe otherwise, please, keep it to yourself, actually, no. Say whatever you want, I don't care. I sincerely doubt you'll be able to convince me that this won't work.."

I talked to Mrs. Knoll the other day, that made me feel a lot better. Ja. So.. I'm thinking about having a get together on the 29th. The people I would want to invite are: Ana, Jaclyn, Rio, Joey, Breanne,and Madison, I think that it could be really fun. Like, all of us would just hang out and watch gorey old horror movies.

I think I'm getting sick. In Vancouver, it was all fine and good for me to go on and on with barely any sleep, but as /soon/ as I get back to Edmonton, WHAMMO! It catches up with me. Fucking climate changes. It was all warm and moist in Langley, now it's cold, and reallly dry. Seriously, I went outside yesterday, and my lips just start to bleed, without me fucking picking at them!@ I hate it here. My freakin' bus pass is gone. I have no idea where it went. It's all because I lost my fucking wallet, so I had to keep the bus pass in one of those retarded slip holder things, so it fucking slides out of my pocket, and I have no fucking idea where it is. Hopefully it's around the computer area, that's likely, because I barely move my lazy ass away from here. I'll do a quick look around.

Yeah, can't find it. But when it comes to finding /my/ things, I'm a horrid looker. Fuck, what the hell am I gunna do? We still have like.. Three weeks of school in September. Fuck, I'll just get Mother to buy me bus tickets, but she won't, because she's a dirty whore. Fucking shit. I have to scrounge the house for bus fare, and get fucking dressed. I have to leave in seven minutes. I'm such a fucking procrastinator."

If all this downloads without error, and turns out to be good sound and video quality, that's a hell of a lot of anime. ^^ 

I still have to burn all my current anime onto disc and delete it off the computer. I worry though, because I'm scared that I'll scratch the disks, or lend them to somebody and they'll be scratched, and that will be the end, because it was my only copy of it. I just can't.. face the idea that Gokusen may be lost forever to me. It brings me physical pain. Oh well, I can always download more, or stalk Neil and rape him untill he lends me more anime."

So anyways, Rio and Michelle were both online, but then they left. Sadness. I sent Michelle a Cowboy Bebop torrent for episodes 1-26, I have no idea if it's a good one or anything, because I never got around to downloading it, meh. She can find out. Violinist of Hamelin 1-5 is at 91.4%, hopefully it will be done by the time Edrihan comes over tomorrow, I'd like to watch it with him. We also have to watch the rest of Full Metal Panic Fumoffu, and Full Metal Panic. I'd like to watch Gokusen again, but he's already seen it, so we musn't waste our time. Alright, so I just set up the downloads for 1-25 of Violinist of Hamelin. I don't think it's that mainstream, so I'm going to copy the description into here.

Hamel, a common village boy, awakes one day to find a single horn growing out of his head. The world around him is beginning to turn to war, with the demons from the northen capital of Hameln warring against the humans of the world. Hamel, along with his childhood friend Flute and lifelong companion Oboe the crow, decides to test himself and discover the past that was erased from his memory. With the ability to play ""magical music"" on his giant violin, Hamel fights both his inner demons and those who would threaten his loved ones. (this is the description of the series, not the manga)

*Shrugs*

I thought it looked interesting, so I went on a spree. The site that I've found all my downloads at, animelab, it only has 100 different anime, so I plan on eventually downloading most to all of them. Right now I'm also currently downloading Airmaster 1-27, Chobits 1-24. Yesh'm, I'm droning on and on about anime, and if you've actually read this far, post your opinions on llamas. 

So anyways, Fasha is going to Japan this Friday for a week. I told him that if he finds /any/ anime that's subbed or dubbed in English, to buy it for me. I will love him forever. I was just wondering, does anybody know how much an anime DVD would go for in Japan? Ehhh.. Whatever, if you know, that's cool, if you don't, then meh.

I shall go back to The Mexican now, for Brad Pitt is calling me."

Holy shit, now she's playing Rasputin. God I love her."

I'm happy right now, truly happy. I don't about anything, school, Fasha, none of that shit matters right now, because I'm happy. Rue and I are on the computers, she's blasting Tom Petty, and we're singing along at top volume. Amazing that a thing as simple as that could make me feel like this.

Ahh, but now the moment is over. Oh well, it was great whilst it lasted."

"event","I finished Mercury's bio at five thirty AM or so, then I went to sleep. After four and a half hours, I'm up and running. When I woke up, I had this really trippy dream thingy mabob. I woke up with the Toshiba on my lap, but the cord was tangled in the blanket, when I untangle the cord, the laptop is gone.. I was like........woah.....

T'was a grande moment.

Errrrghh. The kids are watching cartoons, and for some reason, they refuse to have it at a volume level that does not give me a pounding headache. I'm going online to Launch Cast now, if I were on a computer with good speaksers, I'd teach 'em a good lesson. *Cackles maniacally*"

Okay, so right now, Michelle is online again, but her computer isn't working, but that's okay, because right now I'm actually happy! Tired yes, but happy. I've had some booze. But I think the main reason is that I actually RPed with three people, and for the first time in a long time, I was really into the story plot thing. And I'm listening to some /good/ music. I have Launch Cast running still, I'm listening to a classic rock station, and it's wicked. Wheee! 

After fucking around with my LJ customizations for a while, I decided I liked it just the way it is, so I left it alone. Yay!@

Ohhhohohohoh!@!@#!

GOOD SONG@"

"event","I don't really have anything terribly important to post about.. I'm going to Value Village tomorrow with Fasha and Symon. Then Monday morning, I'm going back home. I don't want to, but I have to, that's life I guess. I'm excited about seeing Edrihan, and all my other friends are just going to have to wait untill school starts. And by all my other friends, I mean Madishon and Keshia. And then I'm going camping next weekend with Madishon. I'm excited about that. Oh, it looks like Karie's up, she had a really bad headache. Oh well.

I want to play Sims. It's all I want to do right now, I'm tiriing of RPing, and I've never liked talking to people on MSN, but for some reason, I can't let myself play The Sims, it's in the hard drive and everything. Euch. Nevermind. When I get home, I'll probably go back to writing in my big black book again, because this is pointless. But it /is/ easier to type then to write. I grip the pencil too hard, and usually rip the paper.

Whatever, I've tired of writing."

"event","Today, I was happy for the first time I can remember in a long time. I actually had tears of joy streaming down my face. What caused this? One may ask, well, I found out that there are more books in The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice then I knew of. Yes, the thought of Lestat going on new adventures, brought me more joy then anything that's happened in more then a year. Perhaps I'm insane, but I think I'm just a fan girl that's let her obsession go a little too far."

"event","I think I have built in instincts, of the stereotypical homosexual. I've been sitting around listening to Elton John, I watched two hours of Cher live in concert, and I feel like shaving my head.

If people actually read my journal, that probably would have offended so many gay people. Meh, I don't give a shit anymore. I haven't had any artsy urges. Although I have been itching to photograph lately.

Everybody should download We Built This City On Rock and Roll by Jefferson Starship, right now. It's the ultimate 80s cheese, but I love it.

If you're not into that, download Rocket Man - Elton John. Everybody needs to have it in their music collection. *Sigh* 

Elton John is my hero."

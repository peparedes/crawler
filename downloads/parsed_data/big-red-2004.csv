"event","So junior year is drawing to a close.  It seems like only yesterday I was a freshman and scared of what high school might bring.  Now I've learned that Lincoln is the perfect high school for me, and I only wish those years hadn't gone by so fast.  I was in such a rush to get over my freshman and sophomore years that I didn't enjoy them as much as I could have.  When I was a freshman, I wanted the year to go by fast because no one likes to be the freshman.  Sophomore year was hard and I wanted it to be over so I could enjoy the next two years without math.  This year was not nearly as hard, and I really enjoyed it (with the exception of AP Chem).  And now I am down to the last five weeks with my senior friends-even the ones I just got to know better this year like Erin.  Once the summer is here, I'm going to be working to get money, and then once that short break is over, I'll come back to Lincoln as a leader of the school.  It'll be strange and sad to have to get closer to my last moments at Lincoln, but they'll have to come.  It's all apart of growing up.  I have to go out into the world and do what I want to do with my life.  I cannot stay this age forever.  I must soon depart from Lincoln with everything I learned there and use it to get ahead in life.  I want this coming year to be the best I've ever had.  I will not hold back at all.  I will do everything I ever wanted to do.  But senior year also means the last year with lots of your friends by your side.  Sure, there's email and telephone, but there is no way to get that intimacy you feel when you're face to face.  I know I'm not going away for college, but lots of my friends might be going south or even out of state!  I know I cherish my friends, and I really want to make the most of my time with them next year.

One thing I was very happy of this year is that I was proved wrong in my assumptions of both Wind Ensemble and Women's Choir.  At the beginning of the year, I doubted that Wind Ensemble would see gold and unanimous superior ratings at festivals for the rest of my time at Lincoln.  But I was wrong.  The trumpets are starting to sound good now and the band in general sounds fuller and darker than I ever thought possible.  In Women's Choir I always have problems with the people who can't sightread and don't have good sonding voices.  But I have seen some improvement by those people, and I know that next year will be a growing year for them again.  Women's Choir got a gold and unanimous superior rating as well.  I feel so content.  

Next year is a whole new year.  I think it'll be good because I'll be taking mostly fun classes (only two acedemics, suckers!).  I want to grow musically, and in order to do that, I need to take up as many musical opportunities possible.  I feel like next year will be a big growing year for me musically:
1) Wind Ensemble
2) SJYS
3) [I'm auditioning for County Honor Band with Rachel]
4) Pit Orchestra
5) Women's Choir
6) VocalEase 
7) [I'm auditioning for Chamber Chorale]
8) [I'm auditioning for California Honor Choir]
9) AP Music Theory"

"event","Layers.  I have them.  We all do.  When I'm at school I tend to hide how I really feel about people.  There are several really annoying people that talk to me but I can't be blunt and tell them to go away.  When they're gone, I complain about them to others and they complain back.  Yes, I know I'm a complainer.  I do it without thinking and I know it gets annoying to a lot of you guys.  So, I'm going to Hawaii and I'm going to be around a few annoying people, and I'm afraid that I'm going to lose my patience with them and yell or something.  I don't even know who I'm going to sit next to on the plane.  Lots of my friends are on the 2nd flight, so there's nothing I can do there.  In a way, I just want to go to Hawaii and not have any friendship screw-ups, but they're inevitable.  I just really don't want to go through that.  Let's just say that people (there's actually a specific person) who can't think for themselves and have to follow a certain person around all the time, which gets really annoying.  I really want to spend some time with just this person, but this person constantly goes to their little friend that they follow.  Now, don't get me wrong, the person they follow is a good friend of mine, but I still feel that we need time just together.  These two people are on the 1st flight, and I'm not sitting next to them because I can't stand to be around them both at the same time.  I know I'm going to get complaints about this, but I just can't do it.  That's the real issue I'm worrying about.  I just shouldn't care anymore, but I do."

Stupid Miss Sullivan's probably going to leave me with a B-, even though I know in any other English class, I'd have an A.  Her quizzes are retarded with a capital r.  And in chem the other day, Mr. Brandalise talked about how he's not feeling good about the passing rate on the AP test this year.  I know I'm not taking the AP Chem exam...screw that.  I'm not paying $90 to take a test I know I'm not passing.  I forgot why I wanted that class.  But now I'm in it, and I'm sticking it out because there's no other class to transfer to and I want to get my science credits over with so next year I can do fun stuff!  My class is lazy, what can I say?  There're only like 3 or 4 people that always turn in their work on time.  The other 12 or 13 of us are like, ""whatever...""  My grade in that class looks really bad now, but I'm praying I can pull a C- out of it.  If not, I'll have a D+ because I never turned in my work on time.  

But a new semester is here, and I'm planning to turn in all of my chapter outlines and problem sets on time.  It's kinda hard when you have that class, music, and mock trial to deal with every day.  It gets worse around the time we do musicals.  Monday nights are horrible for me because I don't get home 'til 10ish, and that's why I never turn in anything on time.  Next year I'm planning to take it easy:
1) Wind Ensemble
2) English 
3) (jazz band???)
4) Women's Choir
5) Dance
6) Vocal Ease
7) Econ./Govt.
8) Mock Trial/Pit 
Yeah, I'm thinking of doing jazz band next year.  That might be interesting.  Back to my trumpet roots.  If I'm not going to do that, I might just TA for Miss K or something.  Or maybe not even take a 7th period, but if I don't have a 7th, I have a really long break before mock trial.  Whatever, I have a little while to figure it out.

I also haven't touched my horn that much and have been sick so I couldn't sing.  So what have I been doing?  Sleeping and watching TV.  Oh, and I saw The Producers finally!

So Christmas was yesterday and I got:
-a sweater
-socks
-pj pants
-Desperate Housewives game
...but no french horn...
and that's about it besides food and stuff.  Jez, I need a life outside of music.  It's kinda sad how my whole life is music and now that I haven't been able to play or sing, I've resorted to laziness.  There is no life outside music for me I guess.  

Once school begins, I'm screwed in AP Chem.  Seriously, even with this break, I'm not going to be able to catch up entirely.  Chem can get really boring, you know.  Like when I'm in class, my mind wanders and thinks of other things.  Well, you can't blame me because it's right after band.  I'm on a music rush.  And then after choir I have lunch and so I'm singing there.  Then afterschool I usually have something music and then I go home singing whatever I played/sung.  And I listen to CDs with classical and jazz music.  See?  My life is all music."

--Miss K

That couldn't be anymore true.  Miss K told me this last night after Footloose.  She noticed how I was very tired and had a lack of energy.  When I explained to her how many things I had going on, she said the quote above.  Well, now Footloose is over with and I can relax just a bit more.  But still I have a lot of performances coming up.  Why is it that Christmas is supposed to be happy but musicians are going crazy with performances?  I guess it's just a downpoint of being an active musician like myself.  I'm really proud that I can play in a pit with Miss K and learn things.  Pit is still the best thing an instrumentalist can do for themselves at Lincoln.  You learn so much, and I've become a pretty good sax player since I've been playing in pit.  It certainly tests your ablility to play loud and accurately.  

So, with this week done, here's everything I have coming up this week:
Monday--Youth symphony and messiah soloist rehearsal afterschool
Tuesday--Late Messiah rehearsal afterschool
Wednesday--Messiah (I'm soloing on ""But who may abide the day of his coming?"")
Thursday--Church choir rehearsal 
Friday--Youth Symphony concerts at 7 and 8pm downtown at the St. Joseph's Basillica FREE!!!
Saturday--I know I have something, but I forget...
Sunday--3 choir concerts for my church (including that darn Hallelujah)
Monday--Mock Trial practice at Hoge, Fenton, and Appel downtown

This after an SJYS concert, Footloose shows, missed mock trial scrimmages, and AP classes.  The only thing that could make it worse is if I got sick.  I hope I don't because I'm going to die as it is."

One of the things I thought about this weekend was what I'm going to do about music when I graduate from high school.  I'm not majoring in music, and I think I'll probably just be in a band and a choir in junior college.  Think about it, I'm not that gifted to be making a career out of music.  I think I'm more advanced than most of my peers, but that isn't going to do me any good when I'm in a school where I'm ""below average"" musically because of everyone else that's better than me.

"event","Yeah, stupid band drama during Little Bone.  Here's what happened:
So we practiced our halftime show on Tuesday to find that we needed music for it because no one really memorized it.  So Mr. Mccoy decided that we were going to play sitting on chairs on the track while the Convertables danced on the field...but he didn't tell Mr. Funk.  So before the game starts, I'm setting up chairs, stands, and sound with some other band kids when Mr. McCoy is suddenly being yelled at by Mr. Funk.  Apparently because he never hold him and the track is only a year old, we couldn't play on the track.  Mr. McCoy just kinda stood there for a while afterwards and looked off in the distance, probably thinking how screwed both he and we were.  He then came over and told us to stack up all the chairs and stands.  He said we weren't going to play the halftime show.  Everyone was so disappointed and we immediately went into the stands and told all the other band kids.  Then, I guess we complained so much that Mr. McCoy called a band council meeting like 3 or 4 times to figure out what the hell we were going to do.  We decided to play in the stands but bring the music stands so we could still use music.  I guess it all worked out in the end, but it was very weird for the Convertables because they thought we were going to be on the field, so they didn't dance for 1/2 the time because they thought that the audience should have time to see us on the field before they came on.  However, I guess Mr. McCoy didn't tell them either.  What else to say but very awkward.  I think everyone was a little disappointed in Mr. McCoy for not telling anyone.

Oh, and I'm playing tenor sax for Footloose, so everyone must come and see it and listen for one of my many solos!  They are super cool and you'll also get to see lots of people in 80s attire.  Good times!  Opening night is Dec. 1"

""What do I find attractive in a guy?""
""Well, if they're good musicians.  Like if they can sing and/or play an intrument well.""
""Also guys that are super polite and proper.  Gentlemen are always appreciated!""
""Confident guys that aren't afraid to say what they have to say.""
""...Guys that dress well...specifically in tuxes"" (now you know why I'm in band and choir...)
""Guys with beautiful eyes""
Then I proceeded to think of all the guys I've liked and compare them to this list.  Most of them fit well into it.  I'm way too picky when it comes to guys, I swear!  Probably explains why I haven't had a boyfriend yet.  

Anywho, yeah...life is confusing again.  I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about some things.  Emotionally I'm confused (well, I'm confused metally too sometimes in class).

I sat next to Nick even though I wasn't supposed to.  Whatever, no one said anything...AND I got to play the mellophone again.  I love the mellophone!!!  Even if it is old, it's LOUD and easy to hold.

Omg, we TOTALLY got shown up by Evergreen's marching band...

On Saturday I went to Tri-M initiation and saw people attempt to perform things even though they were scared to death for no reason.  They shouldn't have been so scared.  Next year they'll see how it all wasn't such a big deal afterall.  I guess most of the performances were okay.  We have a lot of singers in Tri-M this year and not enough instrumentalists.  Then I went to the potluck and ate stuff.  Then I got to do stuff with the board for the reconition of the members.  Before it started, Nick and I were hanging in one of the practice rooms and we were looking at stuff from when Lincoln's marching band was really hot in the 80s.  They had won like over 100 awards in only 3 years and won 1st place in a California competition.  They performed at the Tournament of Roses and in Arazona for a huge parade.  We saw the pics and were like ""woah, what the heck are WE doing here?""  It was a very empty feeling..."

I could write about my crappy life, but I won't...
I could write about how confused I am right now, but I won't...
I could write about my feelings, but I won't...

Instead I would like to take this time to tell everyone I don't really care anymore about anything.  I want to be at peace with myself and to do that is to stop overwhelming myself with repsonsibility and promises.  School is really pointless after elementry school.  I learned everything I needed to know in K-5th grades.  Why am I still in school?  Why am I so unhappy?  Yes, it's that time to realize the truth and to come to my senses.  What ever happened to the simple pleasures?  What ever happened to the innocence this country used to have?  In this day of age, people are way too materialistic and don't realize the little things that make their lives great.  It's all about getting ahead and finding a boyfriend.  What ever happened to strolls in the park and looking up at the clouds?  What ever happened to making chocolate chip cookies and s'mores?  What ever happened to not caring what the future holds and just living for the moment?  I miss THOSE days.  I want to relive my childhood and return to the innocence I had.  I hate drama, even though I do eavesdrop and hear lots of gossip.  I'd rather have the innocence back.  

I'm not saying we're a messed up society, but we have our priorities wrong.  It's okay to be concerned about getting a boyfriend or wanting to get ahead in life, but they shouldn't take top priorities in our lives.  The other day while waiting for mock trial to start, I layed out on the grass and stared up at the branches of a tree swaying in the wind, and it was just lovely.  All of the leaves were turning orange and started falling.  I love fall, and I love the pleasure I got from taking that time to relax.  It took my mind off the crap I have to deal with in the real world.  I want everyone to take time this weekend to just go outside and experience a relaxing moment this weekend.  One where time freezes and you're just clearing your mind.  It's truely one of the best things you can do for yourself..."

6) Trumpet is the best intrument ever after french horn.

10) SJYS is a godsend.
11) Miss Sullivan can't explain stuff.
12) I procrastinate too much.
13) I love not having math anymore.
14) Espanol es muy dificil...no comprendo preterite

"event","My Saturday was so much fun!  Well, at first I had to go to the Performing Arts car wash, where I only washed 7 cars.  Well, one car was HUGE, and we had like 2 big SUVs in a row.  Nick kept trying to get me soaked, but I didn't get too soaked.  I had the job of cleaning the hubcaps and drying the body of the car.  It was fun, and then I went off the the pep band game.  

We had an intense warm-up in which afterwards my lips were dead tired.  We played Fantasmic like for 30-45 minutes.  Not fun playing that song with all those high notes, let me tell you...ouch.  Yeah, then we got to hang for a while while we proceeded out to the football game and we stopped by the carwash to play for them.  When we finally got out to the bleachers, the JV game was still going on.  We had to sit there for like the 30 minutes while they finished the JV game.  Then, we got a break during the time between the JV and Varsity games.  When we came back, we played lots of songs.  I kept moving down the the flutes so I could say hi and talk to them when we weren't playing.  I had Nick, Ann, and Margaret all on the end of their row for me to talk to.  It was very fun, and I stole some water from Margaret and some nachos from Ann and Rachel.  The game was SO GOOD!  It ended up being a tie 28-28, but at the end we thought we might lose because Westmont got a 1st down with only a few seconds to go.  It was scary.  They were the only team we lost to last year, so we wanted to beat them.  But tying is better than losing right?  Oh, and at halftime Nick and I bought some nachos and shared them.  It was good...

After the game, Nick and I went to Golfland where we had lots of fun.  He's is a slightly better golfer than me, but then he plays real golf.  I got a few holes in 1, and Nick got a little more than me.  We shared an icie that was really really sweet, but it was all good.  It was really fun.

After we golfed, we went over to Oakridge and talked around and talked.  We went in a few stores like the Hallmark store where I showed him the coolest ornament with these 3 mice playing a sousaphone, trombone, and trumpet and you'd pull the string and they'd sway back and fourth and play a song.  SO CUTE.  And he found a clock with a treble clef and bass clef on it that was all shiny and it looked like crystle, but you know it can't be real crystle.  Anyway, then we sat down and waited for my mom and we had a discussion about eye color and the difference between being ""hot"" and ""cute.""  Very interesting.  Then we drove Nick home.  I went to bed a fell asleep.  It was very lovely...

The only two classes I don't like are English (surprise for Kelly) because my teacher isn't good at explaining stuff and of course Mock Trial.  But then since when have I said Mock Trial was fun?  I'd be so gone if our team didn't have to be re-built this year.  But since it does, I guess I have to pitch in to help out the new bees.  Ehhh, don't get me started on that...

Anywho, I think junior year is a lot of fun.  Also, with this new block schedule, you don't have to do all your homework done in one night.  It makes it less stressful.  But it still takes an hour and a half away from band and choir rehearsal, which we need desperately!  Wind Ensemble is uhhh, interesting?  Those darn trumpets, I tell you.  But at least the clarinet section is looking good.  Now we have 7 regular clarinets, 1 bass, 2 altos, and 1 contra!  That beats having like 13 regular clarinets, let me tell you.  Yeah, and Women's Choir is still huge, and we could be better...a lot better..."

<P><U>1st period Wind Ensemble</U>: *Cough*&nbsp; Ummm, interesting...chair auditions are coming up soon.&nbsp; Not like I should practice or anything because I already know the order of chairs in my section and don't feel like trying to become 1st chair this year, thank you!&nbsp; Yeah, I'm too busy to be playing 1st.&nbsp; Screw that for now.&nbsp; This year for the Big Bone halftime show we're going to be playing ""Thriller"" with Concert Band *shiver.*&nbsp; I can't say I'm looking foward to that.</P>
<P><U>2nd period AP Chem:</U> Fun, I guess.&nbsp; There are 17 people in my class.&nbsp; Nice class that I understand, or at least understand right now.&nbsp; Yeah, there's a lot of work, but I think I can handle it.&nbsp; Mr. Brandalise is awesome!!!</P>
<P><U>3rd period Spanish:</U> Yeah, ummm, I totally forgot to study for a quiz that we had on Friday on all the capitals of the Spanish-speaking countries.&nbsp; But oh well, right?&nbsp; Probably failed it too.</P>
<P><U>4th period Women's Choir/Voice Studio:</U> Women's Choir is HUGE this year.&nbsp; We do have more 1st altos, but only 3 of us are returning.&nbsp; The whole alto section is outnumbered by the sopranos.&nbsp; Grrr...darn sopranos.&nbsp; Anyway, she wants to move some of us into Concert Choir when they get more men there.&nbsp; I'm staying in Women's Choir though.&nbsp; Voice Studio is pure hell.&nbsp; As usual, I hate the crap out of it.&nbsp; On Thursday we listened to a CD track and took notes on it.&nbsp; Wooptie-doo!&nbsp; That's about the millionth time I've done that.&nbsp; I get how to take notes on stuff for a review, okay?&nbsp; I hate it SO MUCH!!!</P>
<P><U>5th period APUSH:</U> Mr. Cullison is funny, like everyone told me.&nbsp; We're getting new books that have updated material in them, so that will be good for us.&nbsp; Other than that, I know I'll get at least a few blisters from writing in that class this year.</P>
<P><U>6th period Honors English:</U> Good, I read Animal Dreams and everything, so I did fine on the test on Wednesday.&nbsp; I think that's one of my favorite classes.&nbsp; It's very nice and relaxing because English is my best subject (besides music).&nbsp; I just don't want to read 1200 pages for outside reading because I don't really have enought freaking time.&nbsp; If I did, I would do it.</P>
<P><U>7th period Dance:</U> We start dancing Monday, so I can't really give a true evaluation.&nbsp; All I know is that I'm really bad at dancing, but I'm taking dance becasue I need the PE credits.&nbsp; We'll see how it works out.</P>
<P><U>Mock Trial:</U> Yeah, the teacher sucks.&nbsp; I'll be frank.&nbsp; She never watched our practices and she doesn't really understand that winning is everything to us.&nbsp; She's even treating it like a real class with grades and attendance!&nbsp; Good thing I'm not enrolled.&nbsp; But yeah, what can I say but another building year?&nbsp; </P>
<P>In all, this year is beginning to drag.&nbsp; I don't know what it is, but I can only hope it's temporary because I don't want my junior year which is supposed to be the most fun to be boring.&nbsp; We'll have to see.</P>"

Yes, rest in peace, Lincoln High School Band.  You had a good run.  For a long time you were getting gold placings at Heritage Festivals and Unanimous Superiors at CMEA competitions.  Starting this year you'll be nothing but a memory.  I'm sorry to inform everyone reading this that the Lincoln High School Band has a grim future ahead of it.  I went to band camp today to discover the terrifying fact that kids nowadays just don't give a damn if they go to a school like Lincoln that is supposed to have good performing arts program. Lincoln band members are no longer capable of playing musically and with good tone and be in tune.  Those days are gone.  Welcome to the new age of Lincoln band: horrible intonation, extreme carelessness, horrible tone, and lack of respect and effort.  What a horrible thing to happen to a band that was once one of the best in California.  For shame Lincoln Band members, I pity the future.  God save you."

Then we went to Downtown Disney for about an hour because our hotel was close to it.  The next day we went to the Nixon Library and saw lots of cool stuff.  They had that big model of the white house on display because it's touring all of the presidential libraries.  It was so cool!!!  

Then the next two days were Disneyland.  I went on a lot of rides, but California Screamin' was not working because of that accident about 2 weeks ago when the 2 cars crashed and like lots of people had to be taken to the hospital.  I really wanted to ride it, too!  But I rode Tower of Terror like 4 times.  The 1st time you ride it is SO FUN, but afterwards it gets boring.  Andy and I took funny pics at the top, I'll post them as soon as I get them downloaded.  I also had PINEAPPLE WHIP, Ann and I love that stuff.  I took pics with me and the pineapple whip too, so I'll post them later as well.  

On Wednesday we drove to Universal Studios for a few hours before driving home and getting back here around 10:30 or 10:45.  

Yesterday and today I was at the Link Crew training days.  It seems like I'll have fun.  The shirts are new.  They're blue and have ""Link Crew"" in yellow and then on the back it has a quote from Gahndi.  It kinda sucks how I have to go to all 3 days of orientation, but I have to.  I know they're going to screw up my schedule on Monday, so I'll come back Tuesday to try and have it fixed and also on Tuesday I have to get my locker with Nick who gets back on Monday night.  Then on Wednesday I have to go to freshman orientation for Link Crew and later that afternoon is band camp.  

OMG!!!  My cat is pregnant AGAIN.  Yeah, she'll have her babies in a few weeks because she's pretty darn fat right now.  We're going to have to give them away though this time.  My dad is really mad because he doesn't want anymore cats."

In other news, I got done with VBS so that's good.  I won't have to keep waking up at 7:30 to go to church on weekdays anymore.  But today I got free starbucks coffee.

You know that little picky tool that they have and they scrape the place in between your teeth so they get rid of the plaque?  Well, my dental assistant lady was really hard of my gums.  She kept poking them with the prick when she was trying to scape the teeth.  I started bleeding and then she was like, ""are you sure you floss?  Your gums are bleeding.""  I said yes, but I should have said, ""I do floss, but I'm only bleeding because you can't use that tool right.""  Oh, and then worst of all after cleaning my teeth with that pricky thing once, she came back and did all of my teeth again.  It was possibly the worst pain I have felt at the dentist EVER.  I wanted to cry!  Luckily the Doctor came in after my cleanup and checked my teeth.  He found 2 small cavities.  NOOOOO!  I haven't had a cavity in like 3 or 4 years.  I wanted to cry again, but I didn't.  Anyway the doctor was a lot more gentle than that one assistant lady.  I swear the devil must have been her teacher at her detal assistant school.  

Tomorrow I'm getting my hair cut.  Say goodbye to my long red hair.  It'll be gone tomorrow at 1pm.  I'm not quite sure how short I want it, but my mom keeps telling me to get it really short.  All I can say is no.  The shortest I'll cut it is like my chin and even that is hard to do.  I need long hair but I hate it when it's too heavy which is how it is now."

Boy Barred From Singing Soprano in Choir
BEDFORD, Texas (June 29) - Singing soprano is for girls only in Texas' elite All-State Choir, eliminating a 17-year-old boy's chance to audition for a statewide honor and raising questions about gender discrimination.
<img
src=""http://cdn.news.aol.com/aolnews_photos/0b/02/20050629171009990024"">
Mikhael Rawls, 17, has won competitions as a soprano, but he won't be allowed to audition for All-State Choir as one.

The Texas Music Educators Association on June 15 denied a request from Mikhael Rawls to audition this fall as a soprano, a part traditionally sung by girls.

Rawls sings countertenor, a little known male voice part that has surged in popularity in classical and operatic circles. He can sing an octave and a half higher than most boys his age, and he feels most comfortable singing in that range.

He has even won first place as a soprano in the University Interscholastic League's competition two years in a row.

The association, however, does not allow boys to sing soprano or alto, or girls to sing tenor or bass. Association spokeswoman Amy Lear said the group enacted the rule two years ago because of concerns that girls auditioning for tenor parts were hurting their voices by singing too low.

""If you make a rule one way it has to work both ways,"" Lear said, adding that the association does not hold auditions specifically for countertenors because the part is rarely included in the group's music.

In late May, Rawls asked the association to reverse its policy and let auditions be non-gender specific, or to create a new audition category specifically for countertenors. In his petition, Rawls said the countertenor is a legitimate voice part that should be recognized by music teachers, and he argued the policy amounts to gender discrimination.

Neither Lear nor association president Kerry Taylor could think of another male who ever wanted to audition for a traditional girl's part on the All-State Choir. Taylor said the policy doesn't amount to discrimination because Rawls can try out for any of the more traditional male parts.

The countertenor was a popular part in the 17th and 18th centuries, when women were excluded from singing groups, but it was rarely heard of in modern times until an English singer named Alfred Deller revived it about 60 years ago. Today, men can be found singing that part in music schools across the country.

""It seems to me that it's time for the association to sort of wake up and see what's happening around not only the United States of America but Europe,"" renowned countertenor David Daniels said in a telephone interview from London, where he is performing this summer in Mozart's ""Mitridate"" at the Royal Opera House.

Rawls, who will be a senior in high school this fall, has been singing since he was in the sixth grade. He can sing the lower parts, but it makes his throat hurt. He's worried it also could hinder his ability to hit higher notes later.

""I could do the music just fine and I could sound good on it. But I couldn't practice it enough to where I could make state, because I was too worried about my countertenor voice and the effects it would have on it,"" said Rawls, who's the only male in his school's female a capella choir.

Taylor said he's seen no medical evidence that singing tenor or bass can hurt a countertenor's voice. But Timothy Maguire, a professional countertenor and male soprano from San Francisco, said his doctor gave him strict instructions not to sing that way because it could cause polyps to form on his vocal chords.

Participating in All-State Choir is one of the highest honors available for Texas high school singers. Of the more than 20,000 students who audition, just more than 500 students are selected to participate in one of three choirs - a men's choir, a women's choir and a mixed ensemble.

Michelle Rawls, Mikhael's mother, said several attorneys have contacted her about filing a lawsuit against the association, but her family doesn't want to take legal action.

""We just don't think that would be the right thing to do,"" she said.

Mikhael Rawls said he plans to focus now on preparing for his college auditions, but he hopes the state association reconsiders its decision.

""It's really for music and for other people that I'm doing this, it's not really just for myself,"" he said. ""I think it's important that these doors can be opened for other boys in my position.""


Dude, just let the guy sing soprano!  Girls sing tenor, so why can't boys sing alto or soprano?  If that's his range, he can't help it.  Countertenors just don't sing regular tenor in choir situations, they sing like alto or higher.  It got me mad."

"event","I heart finale notepad!  I just downloaded it today, and it's so much fun (and helpful).  Horray!

My brother's been such a brat lately.  I don't even want to get that much into it.  He's worse than usual, and I'm really worried about him in high school.  He's not going to be able to keep up.  

On the upside, I've been able to practice my horn a lot lately!  I'm getting pretty good technique-wise, and now I'm going on to more challenging things.  I got an advanced method book today from Music Village, so I'll see how far I get into it this summer.  I have to learn how to read bass clef like all good horn players should!  I can do it...I can do it..."

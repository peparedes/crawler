"event","I was sick since Sunday night to today sofar and i still dont feel good. We didnt have skool on monday but i was still sick with like everything and then i didnt go to skool on tuesday or wednesday or thursday or friday yah and you thought that you had a cold. Right now im still sick but better and im kinda sad though because i know that some of you people have my number but it kinda made me sad kowing that the only person who called me was billy and all he wanted to know was what elizabeths number was! But he asked me how i was doing. So all you people that have my number thanx for calling me i feel loved(wink wink). I think that im going to the salafias house(you dont know them) because every year a couple of times a year mt familia go over there to play cards.(i always loose) Need a friend right now call me if you please( even though you probably wont)"

"event","Yesterday me and amanda and sam went to the movies to see raise your voice it stunk you could predict everything in the movie so if you want to see it its a waste of good money! So after that amanda and sam came bak to my house and we chilled and talked and played games until 5:15 because sam had to go home because she had to go to her moms this weekend! So after my mom and us dropped her off me and amanda went bak to amandas house and bounced on the trampoline (it was so fun) and we took pictures of us doing flips and after that we got ready to go to the game and watch the boys play football! We lost! Yah so the game kinda sucked to be honest i dont watch the boys i just talk to my friends but it seemed so short.After that the only fun part of the game was the rides because we ( amanda mark me kristy meaghan and amandas mom)were yelling out the windows at random people were beating you and im winning and pimpin ride dog (thats what i said to some guy when we were walking to the car) So then i got dropped off saw my neighbor and was yelling to her from my window to hers and then i went online for a lil and then i signed off and went to sleep i was tired ! Hope you had a great day to! Catch you later!"

"event","Elizabeth, Alicia, Meaghan, Cory, Mikey, and me! Mr. 3000!!!
Movie was kinda boring mikey and cory were being dumb and kept throwing things like sour patch kids (watermelon).Of course the bad part was it was already in their mouths. Sleeping over Elizabeths house where im making my live journal. Fun times Fun times. Watched like the last like 20 minutes of the butterfly effect. LIstening to madonna right now(dont know why).Now watching degrassi.
Again dont know why! Gonna watch more fun tv shows talk to you later

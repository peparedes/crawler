"event","WOW..........I haven't seen this thing in like FOREVER!!  I have been keeping pretty busy with school stuff.  I finally passed those FUCKING MTTC teaching test!!  Thank God!  Now I am a ""real life"" teacher.  Some peeps say that is scary and would never want their children in a classroom with me, but I'm like WHY NOT!!  ROCK OUT WIT YOUR COCK OUT!!  (hmmmm.......maybe that's why?!)  Anyways...besides that, I have just been substitute teaching in various locations around the area.(that sounds so grown up!)  I really need to find a real job, but I haven't really tried.  My mom says that I need to get my ass out of her basement and get a job, but I will...eventually!!  Prolly when they try to kick me out!  I'm having fun though.  Not as much fun as I was having at good ol' FSU, but I'll survive.  I will be up to visit soon enough.  SOmetimes that is better to be away from it all and just randomly pop in.  (I know that a lot of you won't understand that because it's your life up there, but someday you will!!)  I definatly plan on coming up for foraml, even though Al has a rugby game that day!!  I guess it's not too bad since the games at 1p and it's in Midland, close enough!  But that's about all I do...sub, hang out with the family and chill in the 'Nasty with Al!~  I know.........you're jealous!!  (PROLLY NOT!!)  But I just wanted to update this quick and tell everyone I LOVE THEM!!  lata gata............"

"event","Well here it is.....I only have a couple weeks of student teaching left.  I have 2 totally different feelings on this topic.  I am SUPER excited to be done.  I want to get out there and start my own REAL job and actually get paid for it.  Even if I am just a subsitute teacher for awhile, it will still be a lot of fun!  But on the other hand, I am really sad to leave.  These have become my kids!!  I am going to miss them.  But I guess I need to give them back to their regular teacher.  Oh well, it has been an awesome experience.  I am ready for something new.  Now all I have to do to get credit for all of this is to get my portfolio and all my paper stuff done.  A lot of fun there.  Besides that, not too much else has been happening.  I get up everyday...go to school...go home and do lessons and then just pass out!!  I am such a dork!  I need to do something.  
This past weekend I went down to Fenton to see my Kate and to get our bridesmaid dresses!!  It was exciting!  I met Ali in Flint and then we went down together.  We went to Fenton to drop off one of our cars and we thought we were going to get lost....we're dumb...it's okay!!  Then we went down and got our dresses and met up with Kate.  She got her dress fitted too!  It was exciting...so cool to see it all together.  The dresses are real cute. A dark red color with gold.  Not too shabby.....real cute for Christmas time!  Then we went to Kate's and her dog took a bite out of Ali.  That was real shitty!!  We then went to dinner and then to a comedy club and had some drinks.  Lots of fun there.  Kate's mom even got me and Ali a hotel room so that we would be comfortable.  They're family is lovely!!  I had so much fun.  The shower was great too.  Kate got a lot of ""her"" stuff!!  
But besides that, I haven't really been doing anything too great.  Just hanging out trying to get stuff done.  I need to start hanging out more and seeing my girls, but I guess I can start doing that in a couple of weeks.  So until next time................"

"event","well....I love when my teacher walks in and wants to talk to me.....well back to what I was talking about..........Oh yeah...Sun I picked AL up again.  It really sucks that he can't drive for a year.  I have a feeling that will get old real fast, really suckie when winter comes along.  After Sunday...I haven't really been feeling too well.  I don't know what it is, but I hope it goes away real soon!!  Monday I had a lovely teacher in-service.  It wasn't too bad.  I learned some things that I know will help me in the future, so that's a plus!! Today is just another day though.  I just want to get through this week so that I can have some good fun this weekend.  I really miss all my girls and my zetas up there and I need some time with them!!  But I should get back to class.  Until next time................."

"event","hello y'all..........I am just sitting here in my classroom while my students do their much needed homework!  I have to keep them busy, otherwise I might just hit someone!!  I am super excited that it is Tuesday already!! Only 2 more school days and I will be going up to lovely Big Rapids!!  It's homecoming week up there and I feel like I am missing sooooo much.  I can't wait to get up there.  It is much needed!!  Lately my life has been pretty uneventful....I had to take my lovely Allen to the ""clank"" on Friday nite.  NOTE TO SELF: Don't drink and drive!!  On Saturday I went with my sis, bro and pappa to MSU for the State/Minn. game!!  It was a lot of fun, but soooo hella cold and wet!!  But it made my dad super happy to get to spend time with all of us and he loves his college!!  GO STATE!!  Sunday I finally got to sleep a little bit and then I had to go retrieve Al back from the ""pen"""

"event","so I am just sitting here in the classroom again.....Toaday is homecoming here in good ol' Reese and the kids have gone crazy, I swear.  It is also homecoming in Caro.  My Libby is home for the weekend because Aaron is a nominee for Homecoming King.  GO AARON!!  So I need to go home after school and do Libb's hair and all that jazz.  Nothing too cool.  That seems like all I do in life lately is nothing cool.  Well anyways....I went up to FERRIS (love it) this past weekend.  I went with one of my favorite girls Tawnya.  It was such a kick ass time.  All the girls went over to the Phi Sigs on Friday, it was super fun.  It made me realize how much I miss my sisters!!!  Then all of a sudden, the police came and busted shit up.  It was super crazy!!  So we ran around...kept drinking and still had a good nite.  No trouble for us!!  Saturday was Race for the Cure in GR...me and D and T$ didn't quite make it....long story....so Saturday was a pretty ""lay-low"" day.  Another good time was had on Saturday nite over at the house again. I really miss it up there.  I need to visit a lot more.  I miss D and Jaime and A. Golden and my Natalie so much!!  (I MISS EVERYONE ELSE TOO!!!) It is so crazy that I am trying to be all grown up...it sucks....but I will be up there again soon!!  So I just need to finish my day here at Reese High and then I get to start my nite!!  It's homecoming in Caro so I am sure that I will get to see a lot of people that I haven't seen in a while...so I guess I will have to get cute!!  hehehehehehe.... so that is what I will be doing tonite....but that's about it...if anything else fun starts happening...I will let you know, but until then............................"

"event","I am just sitting here listening to my 4th hour talk about China...nothing too cool at all.  I am actually having a lot of fun doing my student teaching.  I am learning a lot and realizing that this is what I am going to do with the rest of my life.  So what have I been up to????  I do A LOT of homework for class in my spare time.  It's nothing like college.  I actually have a lot to do.  I have been coaching my little 8 year old cheerleaders and stuff like that.  It hasn't been too eventful, but it keeps me busy.  OOPS!!!  The bell is ringing...so I will have to get back to this later....love you all and see you in BR this weekend!!!"

"event","I am soooooo bored here.  There is never anything to do.  All I do is go to work and then come home.....I would give pretty much anything to be going back up to Ferris in a couple weeks.  I am going to miss it there.  I am going to miss my girls the most.....love you D and Jamie and everyone else....But anyways. nothing too cool has been happening here.  I went up to my cottage this weekend.  It was awesome.  It was sunny and hot and I got to lay out on the beach, it was what I needed. Now I am back in Caro, just hanging out.  I really want all my girls to get back to BR and this year get started so that we can all party and rock out.  But I am going to make sure that none of us go to JAIL!!  but we won't because we can all decide things for ourselves and know what not to do (You know what I mean D!?!) But anyways....that's about it....nothing too cool...but until next time........."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Collapse of U.S. Economy Imminent"">

In its attempt to establish a world empire dominating every nation
on the planet, the U.S. has exhausted its ability to finance the
expansion and the country now faces imminent financial collapse.
From all indications, it looks like 2006 will spell the end for
America. Consider these five important points:

Point #1 The U.S., Great Britain and Israel are preparing to attack
Iran. As it appears the main reason for invading Iraq was to stop
it from selling oil in Euros, likewise Iran has plans to dump the
dollar come March 2006.

Point #2 U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow issued a warning
recently that the U.S. Government is on the verge of collapse - as
the statutory debt limit imposed by Congress of $8.184 trillion
dollars would be reached in mid-February - the government would then
be unable to continue its normal operations. Considering the
current total U.S. debt stands at $8.162 trillion dollars, once the
official debt ceiling ($8.184 trillion) is reached, the U.S.
government's credit abroad (its borrowing power) is gone. Those
countries (mainly China) who presently keep America afloat by
holding U.S. Treasury Notes, will most likely no longer continue
doing so.

Point #3 Bank Of America and Compass Bank managers (probably all
other U.S. banks too) have been instructing their employees in the
last few weeks on how to respond to customer demands in the event of
a collapse of the U.S. economy - specifically telling the employees
that only agents from the Department Of Homeland Security will have
authority to decide what belongings customers may have from their
safe deposit boxes - and that precious metals and other valuables
will not be released to U.S. citizens. The bank employees have
been strictly prohibited from revealing the banks' new ""guidelines""
to anyone. (however, employees have been talking to friends and
family)

The next time you visit your bank, ask them about it - then ask
yourself, why is this information being kept secret from customers
and the public - what's really going on?

Point #4 FEMA has activated and is currently staffing its vast
network of empty internment camps with armed military personnel -
unknown to most Americans, these large federal facilities are
strategically positioned across the U.S. landscape to ""manage"" the
population in the event of a ""terrorist"" attack, a civilian
uprising, large-scale dissent ,or an insurrection against the
government. Some of these razor-wired facilities have the capacity
of detaining a million people.

Point #5 The Patriot Act and the US Senate's vote to ban habeas
corpus (Nov 14th) - along with George W. Bush having signed
executive orders giving him sole authority to impose martial law,
suspend habeas corpus and ignore the Posse Comitatus Act, have
together pretty much destroyed any notions of freedom and justice
for Americans.

Summary: The U.S. economy is broken, the United States is bankrupt
- the unchecked spending by this administration, the illegally waged
wars against Afghanistan and Iraq, the cost of unprecedented weapons
and military build-up - have all contributed to an irreversible
emergency which is threatening our nation's existence and our very
lives.

Hospitals are closing, major corporations are declaring bankruptcy
and/or moving their companies overseas, the monopolized news media
spews nothing but lies, and our fearless leaders have turned out to
be only ruthless criminals hell-bent on destabilizing our country
and robbing us all.

Be aware - we stand at the threshold of total ruin - the
international bankers and war profiteers care little for our lives
and families - these demons worship money and all things vile and
evil - they have very much to gain from war, misery, disease,
famine, chaos and death (our deaths).

We are right on the edge - the Treasury is already overextended -
the U.S. government cannot (and will not) care for its own
citizens' needs - plus, the whole ""terrorist"" thing is a cruel hoax
perpetrated against a trusting citizenry - and only designed to
instill fear and garner support for the genocide taking place in Iraq.

Should America (along with British & Israeli forces) launch a war
against Iran, or another country, without yet paying for, or even
recovering from the current losses in Iraq and elsewhere - the costs
of such of an invasion will overwhelm an already crippled economy
and push the U.S. over the edge into oblivion.

Question: Considering the U.S. Treasury Notes that China currently
holds (which keeps the U.S. economy going)...

Do you think China will continue to support a country's economy (the
U.S.) whose military launches a nuclear strike against its neighbor
(Iran) - thus delivering a blanket of radioactive fallout over
western Chinese provinces - killing hundreds of thousands, if not
millions of its citizens?

I think not.

Factoring in the aforementioned points of ""preparation"" engineered
by U.S. authorities, I'd say there's a stinking rat in the woodpile
...can you smell it too

Hide and seek. Am I too late to feel desire? 
For all to see: I have left nothing here to call my own. 
So one time do we come to decision. Another time slipped and broke it again. 
Can't help but hide what we want a long time and we know. Trying me. 
Can you bring through please the battle. 
Balancing. I walk through these great fears and poetry. 
So one kind come and go with the wind. Another kind got ot be taken in. 
Step out of time and we both could fall further below.


i like that one line in that song ""i have left nothing here to call my own"" it makes me think of how most of the things i have are not really mine. if i was to ever just want to leave and never come back. i could bring very little.

i think just about the only thing id call my own is my longboard. i guess my snowboard and cds too. everything else has been provided for me by someone else.....

i like the thought of only have my longboard and music. i mean obviously i need food and clothing and what not. but all i really want in life is music and my longboard.

actually i need to buy a new longboard. my longboard is all taken apart in the shed because me and kevin wanted to re do it. i think once its not as fucking cold outside we probably will finish it. but i still wanna buy a new one this spring. the trucks and bearings are all fucked up so i need to get those replaced, and plys this was my first board so i didnt really know how to take care of it so it was all fucked up anyways. but yeah. this summer..me and kevin are gonna longboard so much. hes gonna buy his first board and im gonna buy a new one. hopefully kevin wont be blowing me off for dumb bitches this summer though. lol that way at the cape we can longboard everywhere. yeah.....longboarding....

SLIGHTLY STOOPID AND JOHN BROWNS BODY ON THE 9TH BITCHES!

i missed moe. in boston tonight....fucking a.

life is good. im trying to not let stoopid shit bother me. life is to short to let anything bother you....ANYTHING. remember that people. life is what you make of it.

stay positive and the love will come back to you...."

Like a National guitar 
I am following the river 
Down the highway 
Through the cradle of the civil war

Graceland 
In Memphis Tennessee 
I'm going to Graceland 
Poorboys and Pilgrims with families 
And we are going to Graceland 
My traveling companion is nine years old 
He is the child of my first marriage 
But I've reason to believe 
We both will be received 
In Graceland 

She comes back to tell me she's gone 
As if I didn't know that 
As if I didn't know my own bed 
As if I'd never noticed 
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead 
And she said losing love 
Is like a window in your heart 
Everybody sees you're blown apart 
Everybody sees the wind blow

There is a girl in New York City 
Who calls herself the human trampoline 
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying

She means we're bouncing into Graceland 
And I see losing love 
Is like a window in your heart 
Everybody sees you're blown apart 
Everybody feels the wind blow 

In Graceland, in Graceland 
I'm going to Graceland 
For reasons I cannot explain 
There's some part of me wants to see 
Graceland 
And I may be obliged to defend 
Every love, every ending 
Or maybe there's no obligations now 
Maybe I've a reason to believe 
We all will be received

"event","i wish it was still summer. that way i could actually be doing something right now.

i was thinking about my summer days at the cape today. i have 2 specific memories i reall miss. they both involve getting high down at the bay. one day when erin and james and the kids were down there. it was a really shitty day. its was cloudy and it was kind of raining out. so at one point the rain broke for about 2 hours so i walked down to the bay. and theres these stairs down the street from the beach we goto tha lead down to the bay. so i just sat there, smoked and bowl and just looked out around at the water, the beach, and i knew that i would remember it, because i was truly happy at that point. nothing could have made me upset. 

the other day i remember, it was really warm out. i was at the cape alone with my rents and their church friends. i was extremly bored, i had just been sitting on me ass listening to part one tribe, so i decided i would walk down to the bay. i ened up sitting on this little path that is down the road(the ohter way) from the beach we goto at the bay. so i just sat there, again i smoked a bowl, no one could seem me from where i was, unless they were on the sand between me and the water(no one ever goes over that far) so i just sat there and enjoyed the weather, i could hear everyone at the beaches on both sides of me having fun, playing in the water.....everything and everyone just seemed to carefree. the seaguls were flying around, people were flying kites on the beach, the water was on its way out so not to many people were in hte water. so i just sat there and enjoyed the scenery. later on i walked back upto my house to find everyone had gone to the ocean, so i figured ""why waste this perfectly good day sitting inside doing nothing?"" so i grabbed my board and went to the road. i was still extremly blazed off my ass so i just road around eastham and welfleet for probably close to 3 hours. i just went whereever it seemed fit. it seemed everyone was out and about that day. so many people were walking down the road, or just sitting outside their houses enjoying themselfs.i eventually found myself at the beach right near the landing(this little convience store we have walked to to get candy from for as long as i can remember)the road kind of runs through the parking lot of the beach, and the other end of the parking lot was this amazing hill. i probably went down that hill 15 times that day. i remember, i was borefoot, and wearing my black dickie cut offs, nothing makes me happier than being able to be comfortable wearing no shoes with my dickie shorts. theyre so broken in and comfortable. so after going down that hill a bunch of times i decided to explore past that hill. about 20 feet from it was these perfect sets of hills. not even close to as big as that one hill, but they way they were set up was amazing. the first hill got you a lot of speed, and right after that hill you go up a hill not quite as big as the second hill. and at the top of that hill it curves and goes back down. so id go down the second hill. up the third, and down the third again going around this really tight curve. so i just skated around that road for a while and decided to go meet with my rents and their friends at the ocean. so i skated down to the bike path that goes up to the ocean. smoked another bowl on the path and eventually made it to the beach. found my parents and spent the next probably 2 hours in the water boogie boarding. that was the first time i had gone boogie boarding blazed, and it couldnt have been any better. the waves were perfect. there werent to many people near me, the water wasnt hot, but it wasnt nut numbingly cold either. before we had gone to the cape that weekend i was fearful i was going to bea bored off my ass the entire time, because it was just me, my parents and their mormon friends, but that was one of the best days of the summer. i couldnt have asked for a better weekend. but this entry is becoming much longer than i excepted so i shall end it now. but believe me, i can not wait for this next summer. i will try and have a better day than that. i do not know if it will be possible, but i will try."

so i got my brother sean the new family guy dvds. i also bought him hte movie. since he still has my copy of the movie. but im gonna give him the new one. thats only because my family does a grab. that way we dont have to buy presents for everyone in the family. since we are a family of 8(in the immidate family. 2 girls, 3 boys and my rents) my sister caitlin had me for it. she bought me some clothes. i already opened them so i could wear them for tonight to my aunts house on my mothers side. i like this family alot more. well actually its not my aunts house, its my cousins. we usually have it at my aunts. she bought me some new cords, and this cool longsleeve shirt. im sure she was so glad to have me. she used to always try and get me to let her pick my clothes out for her. she likes shopping to much.

i dont even know what my parents got me. i didnt tell them anytign i wanted. because i didnt even really want anything. i needed a jacket. although the one i have that i stole from kevin that makes me look like a hobo is just fine. the only other thing i kind of wanted was a camra. i dont think i told them that though. but oh well. im still hoping for nothing.\

well i hope everyone has a great x-day or hanukkah whichever you may be celebrating this time of year.

"event","im already excited for longboarding in the spring.

first nice day after the snows melted and the roads arent wet anymore. im gonna get the best bud i have and find the sickest hills i can and just bomb them all day.

speaking of longboarding....friday in gardner theres a blood drive and you get a pass to the mountain when you give blood. so me and kevin are gonna do that. then probably go snowboarding some day. ill probably wanna wait til after vacation that way i can go during the day and not deal with shit loads of people.

i think if you can actually climb into a hummer...you can not have one of those passes that lets you park in handicapped parking spots. if you can get in one i think you can manage to walk a little further...rich fucks.

i still havnt even called to make an apoinment for my GED yet. i told my mom i did so she would get off my ass about it. i think i should call soon since theyre probably already full. eh shit happens.

some chick that goes to my parents church works with me now. thats so horrible. she has come in before(before she worked there) and she had gone on about how jesus is coming again and how i need to goto church and all that shit. and god help her if she starts pulling that shit at work too. cause i just wanna work and go home. i get enough church bullshit at home.

i told damien he needs to give me a new name tag that says ""Brad"" on it. cause this kid derek calls me brad cause im obsessed with sublime. damien said he probably would...BAD ASS

yeah i dont know why im writing in here. i deleted myspace. maybe thats why. im probably gonna delete this too. im trying to ween myself off the internet. deleted myspace. then this. and then no more AIM and then just no more fucking internet.

i wanna go to snow down. phil might go with erin and her husband. if he does i might see if i can get a ride iwth them. i think its in march and its like 200+ for the show and snowboarding. i guess its pretty much like moe down except its in the winter so theres sking and what not. id be pumped if i can goto that.

from the direction she was calling my eye
it could be an illusion but i might as well try
she had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
and i knew without asking she was into the blues
she wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
i knew right away she was not like other girls"

"event","so i havnt made a real update in a while. nothing really have been going down around here. just been hanging out with maggie alot like usual. sean is back as i have already posted about. last night we all went to phils concert at the school. that was bomb. i forgot my fucking sweatshirt in the front though because we had to leave to make calls and shiz and when we came back it had already started and we left early. so umm hopefully phil got that today. my hat was with it, he best have.

umm work still sucks alot. it amuses me because it seems all those people can do it talk shit about eachother. well i guess i couldnt live life without some drama in it. schools gone now so even more has to come from work. like the first day i worked i walked in to people i dont talk to outside of working talking about how i dropped out. kind of amused me. i could picture people going in there and being like ""OH MY GOD EVERYONE! GUESS WHAT! BRIAN DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL!"" the sad part is im getting even more hours there. tomorrow i really need to go applying for jobs around gardner. right now i need a job though. sean cant live at his house for very long, so he needs a place to stay. so we might be getting a place together so i need to save money. and even if we dont, once tessa gets back me her and maggie are getting a place. either one would be cool. each has their pros and cons. like id feel weird living with maggie and tessa and like bringing chicks home. i dunno, maybe thats just me. but then again maggie and tessa are the 2 coolest people i have ever met.

i really wanna follow a band on tour. theres so many bands id love to do that with. just get a bus or a car and follow them around. just enough money to follow them around. if youre at enough shows and talk to the band enough you can always get them to get you in. unless theyre pricks. and if the band was full of pricks i wouldnt follow them on tour....

felt so weird walking out of that school. i didnt expect me to feel this way. i feel kind of remoursful i think. is that that right term for it? i dont think so. but i miss some of the memories. although i hated it so passionatly through out the years, i do have a lot of memories there. i knew alot of cool people. most of them then turned around and started to suck. but thats ok. because ill remember them from when they were cool. 8th grade was fun as hell. even tamara was cool at first. then i met fucking like phil, and jon, and greg, julie, heather. i was still friends with brian mitchell. oh man. thats fucking weird that that was so long ago. i met alot of cool people the next few years too. like lena. she was cool as shit. she used to read this. so if she does. ""youre cool lena."" haha. and then i met fucking maggie. she was in my 9th grade algebra class. our teacher fuckign hated us. i think its funny. the way we became friends was because we always got in trouble in that class. we would get sent to the office together and shit. haha. scott perkins and tim kmeic were cool as hell. and then tessa. she was one of the coolest people i met. i think id have to say tessa and maggie are both the coolest. i dunno what id be doing right now if i hadnt met maggie and tessa. id probably really lame. but yeah i think if i went back in time i wouldnt change anything that happened in highschool. although im happy to be the fuck out of that school. it was fun. helped me become who i am today. wouldnt change anything about my experince at quabbin. although some things i wish to forget just about. like the whole melissa thing, pretty much the first half of the summer after 8th grade. except hanging out with jon up town smoking lots of weed and just hanging out. jon used to be the coolester mother fucker. hes kind of lame now though. its sad. but shit happens. no regrets mother fuckers. no regrets......"

on the way out i randomly say katrina walther there. fucking weird ass shit. i was standing there waiting for kevin and i hear someone say my name so im just like ""who the fuck knows me?"" and it was katrina walther. the last memory i have of that chick is me her and some other chick i dont remember walking around outside smoking a cigarette during gym in like 9th or 10th grade. weird.

turkey day today. thats cool i guess. i have to goto my grandmothers which usually blows because my dads side of the family is retarded. but my grandmothers old so i was be able to see her much longer.

"event","so uhh, i never update, and i told beth i would just for her. what to update about? school sucks...still, i might be able to do that intership thing though which kicks ass. umm this weekend i bought some really cool DVD's. one is ""bob marley the legend live"" i have yet to finish watching it all, but so far its been kick ass seeing that genious playing live. and then i bought a rage dvd it has a bunch of songs from different shows. i would have loved to have been able to see those 2 perform live. to bad zack (im not even gonna attempt to spell his last name) was the only one in rage true to what he wrote about. everyone else wanted to sell out...hence why they started audioslave(which is a shitty band). but yeah. they put on a crazy show. and umm yeah, i guess the newest and coolest development is me going out with beth. kevin actually set me up with someone cool. ive been questioning kevins judge in girls...i mean look at the last couple of people he went out with. ill mention susan and do i need to mention more? but yeah. im outie 5000.

"event","so ive been looking for quotes for the yearbook this year. i nee a quote to put in with my info. heres what ive been thinking of...

<b> ""Open your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you're living?""~bob marley</b>

""If everyone demanded peace instead of another television set, then there'd be peace.""~john lennon

""Man, when you lose your laugh you lose your footing.""~ken kesey

""You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.""~buddha

""Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.""~buddha

<b>""The whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one. Only the moment you reject all help are you freed.""~buddha</b>

""Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free.""~jim morrison

<b>""People fear death even more than pain. It's strange that they fear death. Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over. Yeah, I guess it is a friend...""~jim morrison</b>

<b>""I wouldn't mind dying in a plane crash. It'd be a good way to go. I don't want to die in my sleep, or of old age, or OD...I want to feel what it's like. I want to taste it, hear it, smell it. Death is only going to happen to you once; I don't want to miss it.""~jim morrison</b>

<b>""When it's time to die, let us not discover that we have never lived.""~henry david thoreau</b>

yeah theres alot more. the ones in bold are ones im really thinkging about. the others i am contemplating putting in..just not as much

erin and the kids get here in about an hour...sweet."

"event","my theory that school fucks up my mental state is strengthened. i stayed home today. and today was really great. nothing bothered me. and it had a great ending.

haha i wish i was tripping on shrooms....

HAPPY SHROOM DANCE

me and kevin bought 2 damian marley cds tonight. the new one which came out today ""welcome to jamrock"" and ""halfway tree"" and its cool because halfway tree has some bob marley songs..just different. like they took ""exodus"" and changed most the lyrics and call it moving. but it still had the ""exodus...moving all the people"" its cool. stephan marley wrote like all the songs with damian. its cool. i wanna get some julian marley. ziggy isnt that good though..it like cheesy 80s reggae. but oh wells.

lindsay is a life saver....if it wasnt for her tonight would not have had such a good ending. haha HUBBARDSTON IS COMPLETLY DRY!"

Updated!  And some info:

So here's the deal everyone.

First, the picture is now to big to be reasonably hosted by photobucket, so I moved it to the ImageShack.  What does this mean?  The picture is now bigger since it didn't need to be resized, and so I'm using the thumbnail image they provided so your pages will load quicker.  To see the big one, click the thumbnail.

Second, a couple of people wanted me to use different images than the ones I already did.  Well, here's the problem.  I created this sucker using Microsoft Paint ('cause I'm too poor to own photoshop).  So it's more or less impossible to remove the already existing members of the group without re-creating the whole thing (and I like how it looks right now).  So instead, I'm including everyone with their alter-egos.  But I really don't want to put more than two of everyone on this thing, because it will get too big, so only send me a max of two images of you.  If anyone needs a key to who's-who in the Alphatar Theta Composite, just ask, I'll send it along.  And if people want, I can include all the names below the characters.  Have fun!

Hooray for slacking at work..."

"event","Yesterday was the kind of day where I kept thinking to myself, ""When I get home, I'm gonna lj the hell out of this.""  That's right, you've all won.  I've actually started thinking like that.  The problem with writing this all down?  Stuff kept happening!  Yesterday, when all my troubles felt so far away, was just one of those days.  Let's review:

I woke up knowing that my costume was not quite complete.  My plan was to head out early and pick it up, but that plan was thwarted when I was easily lured into watching Return of the King on Encore.  Why?  Why does that happen with movies on TV?  I mean, I own RotK.  It was sitting right next to the TV.  I could have put it in at any time and watched it.  Instead, I sat and watched the full screen (strike one), non-extended (strike two) version of RotK without my surround sound system (strike three!  What's wrong with the ump?  This movie should have been out right after I changed the channel to it).

Anyway, before I knew it, I was heading out at 12:30 to the Metro.  Oh well.  The shops will still be open, unlike my last attempt.  I love the Metro.  There's just something about the sounds and the tunnel.  And to make things even better, I found the correct power cable to my mp3 player, so I was able to give it new life!  And walking around with an mp3 player is like adding a soundtrack to your own life.  Something I always wanted.  It just makes life seem a little sweeter when it's put to music.

I quickly found the coat I needed to make my costume and then I went in to Borders as I often like to do.  And who do I meet there?  Vash the Stampede!  That's right anime fans.  The <a href=""http://www.absoluteanime.com/trigun/vash.htm"">60 Billion Double Dollar man</a> was in the manga section.  The funny thing is I never learned this guy's real name.  I just kept referring to him as Vash or Humanoid Typhoon.  He and I both ended up singing some karaoke for the <a href=""http://www.hot995.com/main.html"">HOT 99.5</a> radio station remote that was in <a href=""http://www.downtownsilverspring.com/"">Downtown Silver Spring</a>, since they were giving out free food in the form of gift certificates.  I ate some free lunch at Chipotle (for those of you in Hanover, think The Wrap) after forcing people to suffer through my rendition of Evanescence's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/wma-pop-up/-/B000089RVX001002/103-0960281-3629403"">Bring Me to Life</a> (it was the only song I saw on their list that I knew the lyrics to, and I apparently didn't know them very well; also, as <lj user=""sailorliesie""> pointed out, my voice doesn't go that high).  I wish I'd had my camera at the time so I could show you a picture of this guy's awesome Vash costume.

After lunch I went and watched a terrible movie.  I wasn't expecting greatness from <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/"">Saw II</a>, but I was expecting three things:

1.  Cool Mechanical Death Traps (there were only like 3 of them in the movie and only 2 were that cool [the death mask and the oven])
2.  Psychological Terror (very little, it was like the movie was trying to be Cube and failing)
3.  People who played the ""game"" (everyone in the big deathtrap house was an idiot; freakin' clues everywhere and they just want to whine about the time they were in jail and then kill each other without listening to the many obvious clues that had been left for them)

Being let down by the movie, I headed back to Glenmont to put together my costume.  And it was awesome.  Unfortunately, my eyes are closed in the only picture, but you'll get the idea:

<a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/lordof42/The%20Prisoner/GamingPlusHalloween013.jpg"">I am not a number, I am a free man!</a>

Then <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> and I went to a party hosted by <lj user=""nrb80"">.  Had some fun.  Ate some tasty food.  Met some neat people.  And took <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v337/lordof42/The%20Prisoner/GamingPlusHalloween014.jpg"">this</a> picture of the Sgt.  Our biggest problem was getting there.  See <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> had printed directions as well as a card with the address.  Halfway down Randolph road, he realized we had the directions to the street, but not the address.  We decided it probably wouldn't be that hard to figure out which place it was because we were operating under this completely erroneous assumption that they lived in a house in a cul-de-sac (I don't know where we got this idea from).  But no.  We got up there to find that it was a large apartment complex.  We didn't have their number, so we did what any Alpha Thetian would do.  We called the house and had <lj user=""llargh""> read off the phone number from the board.  That sweet phone board.  After a few attempts and our wandering around thinking we'll be able to figure out which apartment it is, we get a call and are saved.

And as if that weren't enough for one day, we went to see <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/"">Rocky Horror</a> at American University.  It was great!  I hadn't seen that quality performance since I was in Houston (many moons ago).  And I must state for the record that <lj user=""leperunclean""> is a shout-out God!  At least, I'm pretty sure that was who was doing the shout-outs at this performance.  It was dark.  I was scared.  Just like Number 6.

Lastly I will mention the two moments of automotive hilarity that the Sgt. and I ran into on our way home.  First, there was this truck abandoned on the side of the road and our conversation went something like this:

(WARNING: Following only funny if you are familiar with The Prisoner)
Me: Look out, that truck is pretty close to this lane.
Sgt.: I'm gonna ram it.
Me: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I don't know if...oh wait, this has passenger airbag.  Go ahead.
Moments pass
Me (realizing I'm still wearing my prisoner costume): Wouldn't that look hilarious with me wearing this costume to go <a href=""http://www.virus.ldh.org/concours/prisoner/images/rover/etouff.jpg"">head first</a> into the <a href=""http://www.beechlog.co.uk/blog200501/rover.jpg"">airbag</a>.
Laughter ensues!

Secondly, we were pulling into our apartment complex.  And normally at this time of night (2:30 in the morning), there are no parking spaces near our apartment.  We have to park a ways away.  Tonight, however, a tow truck was towing a car out of one of the spaces just as we pulled in.  So we waited for him to pull it out and then we parked right in that spot.  It was nifty cool.

I may have forgotten some things, because it was a full, cool day.  I'll send in some more updates as I remember them.  Oh!  And later I will be posting pics from gaming a couple weekends ago."

In other news, we had an awesome game this weekend.  <lj user=""sgtpoliteness"">, <lj user=""harakeke"">, and <lj user=""erics_dtt_blog""> got together while <lj user=""museofgoodcheer"">, <lj user=""bakaninja"">, and <lj user=""raszama""> all flew down from Hanover to play in the game.  Now that's awesome!  We also had a new guy in the game who was a great drunken monk.  Here's a breakdown of characters, for the gamer geek inclined:

(Starting with me and moving left around the table)
<lj user=""lordof42""> : Gamemaster Supreme
<lj user=""museofgoodcheer""> : Human Paladin of the God of Death named Moira (though Sykes kept calling her Thanity)
<lj user=""raszama""> : Grey Elven Knight Errant named Sykes (who was completely insane [see quotes below])
<lj user=""harakeke""> : Human Mage named Celio (never ask him about his backstory, ever)
<lj user=""bakaninja""> : Dwarven Thief named Nobby (who has skill in removing traps, but not finding them)
<lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> : Human Cleric of the god of heroes, stories, and the tavern named Ellsworth Langsham (great at parties!)
<lj user=""erics_dtt_blog""> : Half-Elven Thief named Lute (pronounced LOOT, just in case you were wondering)
The New Guy : Human Monk named Thousand Falling Blossoms (this monk was drunk...and awesome!)

The game was <a href=""http://www.kenzerco.com/rpg/hackmaster/"">Hackmaster!</a>  Here are a few choice moments from the game:

Sykes [while lying about owning a boat in the harbor]: Yeah, I bought that boat...but my guards are very loyal, so we may have to kill them.

Sykes [after kicking open the door to an evil asylum]: I pick up Moira and carry her across the threshold.

Lute [after learning that a character is an orphan and another is an only child] : Well, both my parents are dead and I don't have any siblings, so that makes me kind of like both of you.

Nobby [just before jumping on Sykes's shoulders] : Sykes!  Alpha Technique! [note that this ""technique"" was never mentioned before this moment]

Lute [while attacking a squirrel] : Can I use my ""Who's Yo' Momma Ankle Wrench"" skill on it?

The new guy [during character creation] : Wow, I'm having so much fun and we haven't even done anything yet!

Members of the group, feel free to post some more great moments.  There were a lot of them that I can't remember through my exhaustion at the moment, but it brought back so many fond memories of gaming in the house.

The original intent was for this to be a campaign opener with extra characters since the Hanover crew were willing to fly down to play.  But the response was so strong for more gaming that plans are in the work for us to webcam half the group from Hanover and the other half here in D.C.  I don't know how successful that will be and we haven't really worked out the logistics, but I'm excited to try."

Yes, the Sgt. and I decided to have Tequila Night last night!  And many of you remember (actually, you probably don't) the last time that Tequila Night occurred.  I know I have moments that go in and out.  To make sure that didn't happen again, I took pictures through the evening.  Somehow I managed to take 91 pictures, though I don't remember being that photo-crazed last night.  Of course, as the photographer, there are no pictures of me (though my arms and legs can be seen in some of them).  You can check them out at <a href=""http://www.photobucket.com"">photobucket</a> if you'd like to see.  The username is lordof42 and the password is aoforever.  They are in the album marked Tequila.  If you haven't read <lj user=""sgtpoliteness"">'s entry about it yet, he has the many silly quotes from us through the evening.  You can try to match up the lines with the photos they go with if you'd like, but some of them are fairly obvious.  For instance, the picture of <lj user=""erics_dtt_blog""> grabbing at his groin synchs up with the quote: ""Whoa, that was definitely some groping followed by some crotch punching.""  But I'll let you figure out the others.  Enjoy!  Wish everyone could have been here to help us kill those two bottles.  And kill them we did!"

"event","So work was a little on the blech side today.  I ended up in three separate meetings for various projects and my coffee supply ran out during the second one.  Even with my awesome thermos from IKEA!  Afterwards, I decided that the only thing to do for it was to pick up some of those oh-so-delicious Cheesy Gordita Crunches from Taco Bell.  The following ensued:
""Two Cheesy Gordita Crunches please!""
""We stopped making those.""
(Here, a look befalls our Taco Seeking Hero similar to being told that life is meaningless)
""Well...ummm...I...""
""Can I get you something else?""
""Hope..."" (<---Note that this line occurred only in my head)

I ended up with a steak quesadilla, but it just wasn't the same.  Those CGC's are my only reason for going to Taco Bell.  This is the second time that they sold them for a while and then stopped.  Now, as far as I can tell, there must be an evil goblin creature (perhaps a hobgoblin of some sort) who makes executive decisions regarding the menu at Taco Bell.  Let's be honest.  While there are many items on the menu, they are largely made up of the same base parts.  The CGC contains no unusual products that aren't in other, regular menu items.  So everything they need to make it is behind the counter.  It is also more expensive than two tacos, and contains less product than two tacos.  So the reason for removing the item from production doesn't have to do with products (meat, cheese, hard taco shell, soft taco shell, baja sauce, lettuce) and it doesn't seem to have to do with cost.  This leaves me with the logic that there is an evil force (kind of like a fast food Wolfram and Hart) responsible for taking away my after-work Tex-Mex treat.  A sick, twisted creature of such vile malevolence that it must feed on human suffering with a delight only akin to my feeding on a Cheesy Gordita Crunch.  My crushing despair equivalent to the Baja Sauce of the damned.  Therefore, I propose that the human soul must taste like a Cheesy Gordita Crunch and it's now on the value menu at Hell's Drive-Thru.  Please pull up to the window!

In other news, here's the horrible death I promised everyone.  I dreamt of drowning in less than 12 inches of water in a bathtub.  The awful, tormentuous process of being unable to sit up, to move my nose a mere inch higher in order to breathe.  The minutes of struggling and ultimate horror that lead to the end.  Mixed with the terror of feeling unconsciousness overcoming, knowing that these will be the last conscious moments of life and knowing that you could be saved if you could only lift your head an inch.  So meaningless, so stupid.  I think <lj user=""metallian""> was thinking along the same lines.  It's that mixture of helplessness and terror that is the soft, warm tortilla wrapped around the Cheesy Gordita Crunch of despair.

Also, <lj user=""mythomanic"">'s responses to the filing cabinet question were creepier than expected!  Hooray!

In happier news, I'm still listening to my Serenity soundtrack, and it is awesome!  I am also planning a game right now.  I've been working on a new game world for a few months and I think it will be fun to flesh out with some players.  <lj user=""raszama""> and <lj user=""museofgoodcheer""> are coming down to play in it, as are <lj user=""harakeke""> and probably <lj user=""erics_dtt_blog"">.  I'm really excited, but I'm also worried because I won't have any time to get down to my grandparents' house before then and they have all of my gaming books.  I either have to come up with a new system or just wing the first game without the books.  Any suggestions for free systems that are good or for online copies of rule books I could borrow would be most helpful.  I also still have a whole host of countries, gods, civilizations, and natural landmarks that I need to name, so if anyone has some names they'd like to slip in or would like to make some suggestions about the world I'm creating, feel free!  I can give out information about the world as requested, although not to the players <lj user=""raszama"">, that would be telling.

Not a lot of links this time around, so here's <a href=""http://www.notquitewrong.com"">one</a>.  It's for a webcomic I read recently.  <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> and I met the author of this webcomic at the <a href=""http://www.bohemiancaverns.com/"">Bohemian Caverns</a> on Belgian Ale Night!  It's a relatively young webcomic, but he's trying to rally some readers and there are some funny strips involving pirates, hoodies, and fish in the pants.  Enjoy!  We met this guy thanks to some friend connections through <lj user=""llargh"">.

'Til later!"

In big news, I got a free filing cabinet today.  It was on this deserted corner of a country road up in Damascus.  <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> and I saw the ad on <a href=""http://www.craigslist.com"">craigslist</a> and I really needed a filing cabinet, so we drove almost an hour away to pick it up.  It felt really weird, because it wasn't at anyone's house or anything.  Someone had just dropped it on this corner and then posted about it on craigslist.  I stopped the car, and the Sgt. just jumped out and grabbed it.  It felt kind of like robbery, except that it was free.  I half-expected it to have secret government documents in it.  I mean, come on, it was a plain brown filing cabinet just sitting along a country road outside.  That's perfect!  If you have exciting conspiracy stories about what ""could"" have been inside, I'd love to hear them.  In the end though, it just had a few cobwebs.  I scooped them off and loaded the thing with all those precious pieces of paper I wanted to keep organized.

In other news, I had a nightmare about one of the most psychologically terrifying ways to die (at least, to me).  I told <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> about it and he shuddered in horror, so I think he probably agrees.  Can you guess what this horrible thing is?  The answer will be posted tomorrow.  See, it's like a cliffhanger.  A morbid, creepifying cliffhanger.

Speaking of morbid and creepifying, <a href=""http://www.serenitymovie.com"">Serenity</a> was awesome as <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/serenity"">so many have said</a>.  We went on opening night and if people remember <lj user=""harakeke"">'s costume from the pre-screening, he improved it!  Here's hoping for the BDT (Big Damn Trilogy)!  I forgot to take pictures, and for that, I'm sorry.  And I have to post this, because it's Firefly related and awesome.  It's Adam Baldwin singing (badly) the <a href=""http://www.nightsoft.net/sneaker98/AdamBaldwinHeroOfCanton.mp3"">Hero of Canton!</a>  It may take a while to download.  I get all of my Firefly clips from that site and it downloads pretty slow.  But it's free!  Like my filing cabinet!  It all comes back to the filing cabinet.  Almost like some kind of conspiracy!  What could be in that filing cabinet?

I have now read all of my comic books from <a href=""http://www.spxpo.com"">SPX</a> and I want more!  Hooray indie comics!  If anybody has any good titles they'd like to recommend, I'm all for hearing them.

I also came up with a cool idea for a card game that I think would be awesome!  I'll post about it after I flesh it out a little more.  Part of the idea I stole from a comic that <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> got at SPX, but then I twisted it and made it mine.  Twisted like the case of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders v Pussycat Cinema that I was told about yesterday.  <a href=""http://www.moviewavs.com/cgi-bin/mp3s.cgi?Starship_Troopers=more.mp3"">Would you like to know more?</a>  Ask <lj user=""sgtpolitness"">

First off, <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> is here now!  It's good to have a roommate, you know, to keep me from going crazy...alone.  It's great not having to go places all alone anymore.  We've gone to <a href=""http://rfdwashington.com"">DA's RFD</a> several times to enjoy their delicious beer.  Unfortunately, our crazy exploits are pretty much limited to the weekends since I work all the time during the week.

On the work front, my boss gave me first authorship of the paper we submitted to the <a href=""http://www.the-ins.org"">International Neuropsychological Society</a>, which is just awesome.  Also, I'm getting to do all sorts of fun fMRI work where they're letting me design the tasks and crunch all the data for the paper.  I'm also getting to do cognitive baseline testing on professional athletes as part of the concussion prevention and treatment program I'm a part of.  I also had to get up massively early this past week to help my bosses set-up for the <a href=""http://www.dcchildrens.com/dcchildrens/fordoctors/pdf/PediatricSportsConcussionSymposium.pdf""> Concussion Symposium</a> at the hospital.  If you take a look at that pdf, two of the doctors I work for are listed there, Gerard Gioia and Jennifer Janusz.

We've had several guest stars on the apartment sitcom that is the life of <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> and <lj user=""lordof42""> (for those of you who've watched enough syndicated TV to wonder this, the answer is that, for the most part, I'm Oscar and he's Felix).  <lj user=""erics_dtt_blog""> is practically a regular.  He's been here three times.  Close behind is <lj user=""sailorliesie""> who has been here twice.  And just a short while ago, <lj user=""dontboxmein""> stayed the night with us on her way back up to Hanover.  She even left us her lunch for the following day in the fridge, though I don't think it was on purpose.  And I know for a fact that <lj user=""museofgoodcheer""> and <lj user=""raszama""> are planning to come down in the very near future.

People should continue to visit us.  And people should move down here.  We need to get a gaming group started, and with <lj user=""erics_dtt_blog""> just down south from us, and <lj user=""harakeke""> just up north, we really only need one more person to get an awesome game started, though we could certainly take as many as three easily.  I've got a great fantasy campaign I've started on and all I need is a game system to plug it into and a group of gamers ready for some hardcore dungeon crawling.  I've also got this cool <a href=""http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/arkhamhorror.html"">Arkham Horror</a> board game, but I lack a large enough group to battle the mythos.

It's been a crazy world of knowledge in our apartment.  I feed random neuroscience facts to <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> and he hits me right back with random law facts (I still can't believe New York allowed them to use <a href=""http://lawschool.mikeshecket.com/property/piersonvpost.htm""> Pierson v Post</a>) as precedent for who controls a homerun baseball [the baseball is like the wild fox])

Other knowledge passed around our apartment includes that <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> informed me Friday night that the <a href=""http://www.spxpo.com"">Small Press Expo (SPX)</a> was happening in Bethesda this weekend.  I was overjoyed!  We went yesterday, seeing as how it takes less than ten minutes to get to Bethesda from our apartment.  I spent tons of cash on comic books, cash I probably shouldn't have spent on comic books.  Here's a rundown of the books I picked up if anyone's interested:

*Empty Chamber Preview by A. David Lewis and Jason Copland
Coexistence by Matt Dembicki
Dead West by Rick Spears and Rob G (haven't read it yet, but the guys said it was a ""zombie western"", and I was sold)
*Doctor Dreamo by the DC Conspiracy (group of comic artists in the area, they're having a <a href=""http://home.dcconspiracy.com"">Counter Culture Festival</a> in November)
*Zacherley's Midnite Terrors #3
*Mortal Coils: Bodylines by A. David Lewis (this thing was really, really cool)
Ill Conceived by TJ May, Shelton Bryant, and Jason May
A Day in the Psychosis of David Price by TJ May, Mosse, and Jason May
Western Tales of Terror #1-5
Hoax #3
Content #1
Action Philosophers #3 (the one with Sigmud Freud and Carl Jung!)
Table for One by Bosch Fawstin
Strange Detective Tales #1 and 2
Surrogates #1 by Rovert Venditti and Brett Weldele

* denotes books I've read since I purchased them yesterday

Also, <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> got this really cool comic we were both drooling over called Moped Army and I'm going to read it as soon as he's done with it.

As you can see, much money was spent, and many cool artists and writers were met.

I also went and saw a band called <a href=""http://www.dungen-music.com/"">Dungen</a> the other weekend.  It was another of <lj user=""sgtpoliteness"">'s great ideas.  Hmmm...I think I might be coming up short in the great ideas arena.  Although I am excited to take a trip over and check out the <a href=""http://www.rennfest.com/"">Maryland Renn Faire</a> sometime next month before they close.

I also thought I should mention that the other night, <lj user=""sgtpoliteness""> and I were watching <a href=""http://www.mcpeepants.com/sounds/shorttheme.mp3""> Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a>.  It was the <a href=""http://www.mcpeepants.com/sounds/310broodwich/broodwich5.mp3"">Broodwich</a> episode.  It was so funny that we're still laughing about it.  And when I told <lj user=""sailorliesie""> about it, she found me this awesome <a href=""http://www.mcpeepants.com/frames/310broodwich/frame20.jpg"">wallpaper</a> of a lobotomized Master Shake eating the sundried tomatoes that will send him to hell.  This picture now graces my desktop.

And for anyone who was wondering, my parents just returned home after their horrible <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/09/25/rita.assess/index.html"">Rita Evacuation</a> to find our house and business completely intact.  So there's even more good news!

Well, there's a lot more, but that's all I can think of right now.  I've got a bunch of comics to read, so I'll probably be up to that for the majority of the day.

I miss everbody and hope to see you all soon!

"event","That's right everyone!  I'm back on livejournal!  It's been 3/4 of a year since I've posted, and lots of madness has occurred since then, but below is the current situation:

1. Got a job at Children's National Medical Center in D.C.
2. Living in D.C. (actually suburban Maryland).
3. Missing Alpha Theta.
4. But enjoying my new job.

Also, I found a whole mess load of pics on my digital camera that I thought people might want to look at.  They're at <a href=""http://www.photobucket.com""> photobucket.com </a>. Username: lordof42 password: aoforever  They're in a folder called ""RandomStuff"" and random they are!  Feel free to peruse them.  I think they are from: Tropical Tails (Winter I think?), Pub Night (winter), some random tails events, Rock you like Hurricane Wilson Typhoon Mellows, and perhaps some other stuff.  111 pictures in all!  Enjoy!  I sure did, but they make me miss Alpha Theta even more.

I'll start making some regular updates this weekend while I'm hunting for furniture (right now my apartment is quite barren).  I did get my high speed internet installed though, so hurray for access!  Everyone should feel free to e-mail me at my alum account and to call me on my cell phone (although to keep my number from being all over the net, just blitz me and I'll send you the number).

More info as it comes!  I hope everybody's having the mad crazy variety of fun!"

What else has happened lately?  Lots!  Next, there was my oh-so awesome Salsa Mellows which I was too much of a fool to get pictures of!  Argh!  But it was cool.  We had 8 kinds of salsa, with varying degrees of hotness, and 6 kinds of chips which were all quickly devoured as we listened to some salsa music!

After that, there were the fateful GREs!  I did well!  Hooray!  I just got back the final score report that informs me I did well on the Analytical Writing section too!  I think this is call for a big fat ""Huzzah!"" as it is becoming ever more likely that I will get into graduate school!

Next there was DARTCON!  Amazing DartCon, which I also didn't get pictures of!  Argh times two!  Anyway, I ran three games and played in one.  Nick ran an awesome Call of Cthulhu game where I ended up running for my life and leaving the party to die horribly.  Next came my Call of Cthulhu LARP!  It was awesome too!  So many great things!  If anyone wants to hear more about Pickman's Unveiling, I'd be happy to oblige, but I won't put it up yet, since I can't be sure anyone wants to read about it.  The players loved it, though!  As soon as it was over, we had the DartCon dance party with a collection of gamer tunes I arranged.  It was incredible with all the dancing to gamer muzac through the night!  The next day, I ran a Hackmaster game which had an amazing bar brawl involving improvised weaponry in the form of gnome tossing.  Much hilarity ensued!  That evening I ran a Call of Cthulhu game, but I'm afraid that my under-prep for that game and my fatigue from the previous 36 hours left it as a fairly mediocre game.  It wasn't the greatest way to end DartCon, but lots of fun was had throughout the rest of the event, so hooray for that!

After an amazing off-term of work, I headed to Tampa for a few days to see <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sailorliesie"">sailorliesie</a>.  It was a fantastic trip full of movie watching, <a href=""http://www.projektrevolution.com"">crazy rainy concerts</a>, <a href=""http://www.deadlikeme.com"">Dead Like Me</a>, and <a href=""http://www.ihop.com/"">paradies pancakes at IHOP</a>!  We also took a trip to the <a href=""http://www.meatballs.com/"">Spaghetti Warehouse</a>, which I haven't been to in years!  Best of all, I got to spend a week with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sailorliesie"">sailorliesie</a>, which makes it the perfect trip.

Lastly, I took a trip to Houston to visit the folks.  They treated me to several meals at our favorite Mexican food restaurant, <a href=""http://www.b4-u-eat.com/houston/restaurants/reviews/rsv2154.asp"">Gringo's</a>.  I also got to see a <a href=""http://www.clearlakefootball.com/"">Clear Lake High School football game</a>, since no one does football like Texas.  While I was there, I also visited my favorite game store, <a href=""http://www.horizongames.com>Horizon Games</a> where I picked up some new games for the house which I will be tossing out some reviews for soon.

Now I'm back, sitting in the SLR, alone...Everyone keeps leaving the house for interim!  How am I supposed to slack off properly if people aren't here?  Hurry back Alpha Thetians, your house is calling you home!"

Also, I went and saw <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368447/"">The Village</a> and it hurt me badly.  That movie was just so, so bad.  And <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/village/"">rottentomatoes</a> agrees.  My favorite review read, ""Every village needs an idiot -- and M. Night Shyamalan is hoping it's you.""  Ah, to be a <a href=""http://www.leenite.org/thecritic/wavs/jay/jayessay.wav"">critic</a>.  If only I'd listen to his wise words.  Of course, if you liked Signs, which I hated, you'll probably like this since it follows the same M. Night Shyamalan formula.

Much Sonic was played yesterday as I walked in and out and I'm happy to see Sonic being as well absorbed into the house as <a href=""http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/thecallofcthulhu.htm"">Great Cthulhu!</a>

And of course there was Friday when I learned that if you're already feeling a little sick, you should not add Tequila to the mix.

The chipmunk has outsmarted us all in that it was capable of entering the trap, eating the food, setting off the trap and still escaping through powers unknown.  A chipmunk Houdini."

"event","Just so everybody knows the score (7 to 1).  It was a crazy long day which ended with some delicious fried cheese courtesy of Broken and her Spanish themed Mellows event tonight.  I got some great pictures of people who I forced to dance with the fried cheese and I should be slapping those bad boys up here sometime tomorrow.  That's about it for now.  Chipmunk trap is set, but the chipmunk appears to be too smart for it.  Also, the parking lot is finished and the color and texture of the new gravel make me feel like I'm on the moon.  Yesterday I went out there and jumped on it like I was on the moon and coerced others to join me in my insane fun.  I think I'm going to try and get an American flag to plant in the parking lot, it'll look really cool.  ""One small, silly step for Thetian, one giant, goofy leap for Thetian-kind.""  Sorry for the lack of nifty links and pictures, but I got nothing today.  I guess you could always go play some <a href=""http://www.flashplayer.com/games/ultimateflashsonic.html"">Ultimate Flash Sonic</a>.  Have fun!"

"event","I nearly forgot about an important topic in my previous post, so this is a semi-addendumish thing-a-ma-jig type post.  I had to walk back from ""A"" lot after parking my car.  Now, I was way too tired this morning to change clothes for car parking, so I just wore my pajamas and my bathrobe.  Firstly, there were all these deer around the parking lot and they seemed totally unimpressed by my monstermobile as it pulled into the lot.  They just stood there and watched, so I walked over to one.  It wasn't afraid or anything, it was weird.  It finally ran off when I got right up to it and reached up to pet it, but I was right there.  It was a pretty cool feeling I have to say.  Then I started my walk back to campus and all these people kept honking at me from their cars and giving me thumbs up and nodding in approval and I can only imagine this is because I was wearing the bathrobe.  Kind of weird how easily Dartmouth students get excited about something.  Then I went into the Hopkins Center to snag a free ticket to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366551/"">Harold and Kumar go to White Castle</a> (which by the way is getting amazing reviews at <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle/"">rottentomatoes</a>, as unlikely as that seems) and people kept stopping me and asking really deep questions like, ""Are you really as cool as you look?""  As well as several prospective students giggling as their tour group walked by me and the tour guide responding with, ""And there's a guy in a bathrobe.""  So, quite the interesting walk.  Not one I'd want to take every day, but it did help mix it up a little when life was getting to chipmunk-oriented."

"event","The driveway's getting fixed today and the noise it's causing is driving me insane (0/1 SAN loss for those of the <a href=""http://www.chaosium.com"">CoC</a> persuasion).  I had to move my car to ""A"" lot this morning so they could get in.  Now, this is nothing new to other Dartmouth students, but for those of you who are unaware of what is known as ""A"" lot, I will explain.  Others may feel free to skip the next paragraph of rant.

So Dartmouth lacks parking.  This is nothing new, many colleges have parking problems.  My problem is not with ""A"" lot itself, but the fact that it is called ""A"" lot.  If you were driving to Dartmouth and they told you to park in ""A"" lot, how would you react?  I'd say, ""Oh goodie!  ""A"" lot, that must be right in the very center of campus.  I mean ""A"" suggests the closest lot, right?""  Well, what they don't tell you is that there isn't any such thing as ""B"" lot.  That's right.  ""A"" lot is all by its lonesome.  I think the sign has been misinterpreted all these years and that it actually reads that this is ""a lot"" for parking rather than the ""A lot"" for parking.  See it's about a mile walk to ""A"" lot, and it's beyond the boundaries of the college.  It's a ditch the college purchased and told students to park in.  The response that I give to this is ""Rowargh!""

Moving on to other things that make me say ""Rowargh!""  The chipmunk thwarted me again today.  I know it sounds like I'm obsessing over this, but...well...I am.  I chased it into its hole today after chasing it around the house like a madman.  I thought that it was a good thing to chase it into the hole, but apparently that hole goes up into Thalia's room and freaked her out!

It was pointed out to me that my unprovoked hatred of this chipmunk borders on a Montressor and Fortunato type of situation.  In fact, I'm considering what would happen if I just plastered up the hole now that I've located it.  I can see it now:

Chipmunk [who I think I'll call Fortunato]: ...let us be gone.
Me: Yes, let us be gone.
Fortunato: For the love of God, lordof42.
Me: Yes, Fortunato, for the love of God!

Oh, yeah!  Evil and crazy, that's the way to do it!  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sgtpoliteness"">sgtpoliteness</a> has suggested we use our humane rodent trap to catch it.  That's fine, but only if I get to plaster it into the wall afterwards, because I've got this ""for the love of God"" line in my head and I really want an excuse to use it.  Anyway, we're probably going to set the trap and try to catch the monster Scooby-Doo style.  I think the Chipmunk is actually crazy, old Mr. Clark the owner of the abandoned amusement park.  Or perhaps it's the guy who named it ""A"" lot coming back to taunt us some more.  Either way, <a href=""http://www.amontillado.ru/eng/poe_cask.html"">In pace requiescat!</a>"

I finally got my LARP writing going on for DartCon which, by-the-by, will be on August 14-15 at Alpha Theta.  No admission price.  Lots of games and free food!

Later this evening I went over to Short Bus's and we made some tacos and watched <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/stars3/yank2010/Theme.wav"">Flash Gordon</a>, one of the greatest and most awful movies of the 1980's.  Most of the cast of this <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080745/"">film</a> are pretty forgettable, but it does have Richard O'Brien of Rocky Horror fame and Timothy Dalton, who some of you probably remember as the worst James Bond of all time.  Anyway, the theme song, which I might add was written by Queen, is one of the silliest and most absurd things I've ever heard and now I find myself saying ""Flash, Ah-Ah!"" everywhere that I go.  While I was watching Flash Ah-Ah savior of the Universe do his superheroing over at Short Bus's, the rest of the house engaged themselves by watching <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/"">Boogie Nights</a>, which <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/moroccochloe/"">moroccochloe</a> may remember that we watched freshmen year.  She might also remember that I had no idea what the movie was about and timidly asked, ""Umm, what's this movie about."" when it started going in the direction that it looked like it was going.

Just so everyone knows, I have no doubt in my mind that Flash Gordon would be totally beaten down by the greatest of B-Movie Sci-Fi heroes, <a href=""http://www.frogstar.com/wav/buckaroo-banzai.asp"">Buckaroo Banzai</a>(click on the theme song entitled buckaroo.wav).  That theme song always makes me want to go walking.  It's just wonderful, happy travel music and I've personally always wanted my own personal soundtrack to follow me around.  You can stack the two heroes against each other by checking out this <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086856/"">movie</a> too.

"event","So today was BBQ day at the house.  Barbara had me explain the concept of role-playing games to Meh's family who looked at me so terribly strangely the entire time.  

Following the BBQ, I went with sgtpoliteness down to Radio Shack where I picked up the battery for my digital camera since no one in Hanover, including the Hanover Camera Shop, sold CRV3 batteries.  Then I get gouged for 16 bucks from Radio Shack for this one battery.  However, on the bright side, I now have a functioning digital camera and odds are good that fun pictures will be posted in the near future.

After completing my camera quest, I walked down to Foodstop with Uriel and the most peculiar thing was happening the entire time.  I was walking down there to get one of these Coolatta things from Dunkin' Donuts and on the way we passed not one, not two, not even three, but four different members in three different groups walking back with the exact same thing I sought.  I'm starting to think that someone is testing their mind-control drugs in the water (and I'm looking at mdrnprometheus as a possible culprit).  If this is not the case, then I feel like <a href=""http://tzone.the-croc.com/sounds/tzone11.zip"">Rod Serling</a> should be narrating my life (I'm afraid I could only find the intro in zip format, so you'll have to download it and unzip it to listen to):

""lordof42, a normal Dartmouth student in a frightfully abnormal situation.  Until five minutes ago he was a confident member of Alpha Theta looking at the world through rose colored glasses.  Unfortunately, his tinted vision missed the scarlet scrawled warning written on the door...to the Twilight Zone.""

Anyway, I also went to see the Bourne Supremacy tonight.  It's a fun film, but the more exciting story is the tale of the bumbling Dartmouth students.  I went to the movie with several other people and we determine just as we were getting to the front of the refreshment line to change what we were getting.  I usually hate people who do this and I'm sorry to everyone who had to suffer through our conversation.  To protect the innocent and ridiculous, I have renamed all of the members but myself:

#1 (who we'll call #1): Hey, what are you planning to get.
Me: A small popcorn and a small drink.
#1: No, wait, that price is awful.  Look there's a combo for $8.
#2: Yeah, let's get the combo.
The eternally patient woman at the refreshment line: What would you like?
Me: We've almost figured it out.  Sorry.
The EPWATRL: Sure thing.
#2: Okay, so we'll get the combo.
The EPWATRL: Would you like butter on it?
Me: Yes.
#1: Yes.
#3: Yes.
#2: No.
#1: You don't like butter?
#2: I prefer salt.
#3: Well, we can get that too.
#2: Alright, that's fine.  So, should I put salt on it?
Me: A little.
#1: Sure.
#3: No.
Me: What if it's just a little?
#3: Well, alright.
(It's important to note that at this point, everyone behind us in line had heard what was going on and made it a point to move to the longer, but faster moving line)
The EPWATRL: So what kind of drink would you like?
#2: How about coke?
#1: No, anything but coke.
#2: Alright, how about root beer?
#3: I hate root beer.  Get sprite.
(Personally, I hate sprite, but at this point I was willing to make this sacrifice to get us out of this embarrassing situation, so I kept my mouth shut)
The EPWATRL: Alright.
(Still smiling, the EPWATRL turned and put our order together.  Unfortunately, our confusing ordering methods that were not of this earth led to one mistake.)
#2: Umm, is that root beer.
The EPWATRL: Yes, wait, you wanted sprite didn't you...Well, how about if I just give you another cup with sprite in it?

Thus ends the tale of horror and macabre that was our movie going experience.  Now I'm as tired as a man whose glasses just broke as he mutters, ""That's not fair.  There was time now."" For all of eternity."

It's from the equally awesome show <a href=""http://www.deadlikeme.tv/index.php"">Dead Like Me</a> on Showtime.  I don't have Showtime myself, but that's why the gods of media graced us with DVDs.  I have to recommend it to anyone with a dark sense of humor.

Also, I bought my plane tickets today for a trip I'm taking.  I'm really excited about it.  It makes me wish the 16th of August would hurry up and get here!

Enjoy the song everybody!"

"event","So today was the day we cleaned the house.  But that's really the secondary news since we also decided to clean the house in a very different way while we were at it.  Earlier today as we were breaking up jobs to be done, we decided the chipmunk had to go.  War was declared over our uninvited guest and the house teamed up to hold off the never-ceasing onslaught of a single chipmunk, a chipmunk with an attitude.  Several of us, myself included, snagged some brooms and started lifting couches and scaring that chipmunk all over the place.  It must have gotten desperate at one point, because it charged Barbara.  I could sense the madness emanating from its small, but devious and twisted mind. Barbara used her quick reaction skills to save herself from the evil as she dived onto the couch, temporarily escaping its rodential wrath.  We acted more cautiously after the attack, moving carefully and stealthily through the room.  The chipmunk, unfortunately, was much faster than we are as it dodged from couch to couch.

""It moves like they do.""  Came the cry of one of my fellow broom warriors as we began wishing we could move in bullet-time.

After several minutes of jumping, dodging, sweeping, and screaming, nothing much had been accomplished, no one had yet made contact with the chipmunk and several of us were beginning to doubt our right to belong at the top of the food chain.  We regrouped and began talking strategy suitable for military texts when one of the onlookers to our misadventures spoke up,

""While you were all arguing over what to do, the chipmunk wandered out the door.""

We looked at him in disbelief for a moment, but then, rather than claim that the chipmunk had gotten the upper hand, we decided to delude ourselves into thinking we had placed ultimate terror deep within that monster's black heart!  In truth, it's probably telling all its chipmunk and squirrel buddies about it at the bar and laughing up a storm, but either way, the house is ours again!  With our regained ownership of the establishment, we returned to the cleaning.  So after the excitement of battle, I headed downstairs to polish all the wood paneling.  But no amount of shine will take away that black visage of evil that I looked upon in that chipmunk of darkness.  I shudder when I think that it remains out there, waiting."

"event","So I went with Meh to a local liquor store.  We get in line to pay and they inform us that because Meh's in-state, totally legal ID has been bent up, they won't sell alcohol to either of us.  Now, for those who are unaware, all liquor stores in New Hampshire are owned by the state government.  I thought I'd point that out because we said, ""Okay, well, can't you use your scanner to prove it's a legal license.""  And they responded with, ""We don't have one.""  How is it that a state run liquor store isn't capable of having a scanner for legal IDs?  So all I can do is sing about <a href=""http://www.fortunecity.com/silverstone/cowley/105/tequila.mid"">Tequila</a> tonight.  Also, the chipmunk is still on the loose.  I feel I should name my new nemesis.  Any ideas?  Anyway, it's almost time for Tails, so I'm off!"

"event","So this chipmunk slipped into the SLR today and it has been running around doing all sorts of craziness.  A few minutes ago it popped out from under one of the couches and I stared it down for about a minute.  I felt pretty sure of the contest, thinking I was the superior race.  But then the chipmunk freaked out and made this gesture that seemed to imply giving me the finger.  Then while I was writing this, the monster started chewing on my power cord!  That chipmunk has made an enemy for the rest of its short life!

In other news, it's probably important to note that if chipmunks can get into the house, I would imagine that rage zombies won't have much more trouble and if rage zombies get into the house, then I must be failing at my office:  Rage Zombie Management Chair.  I think I'm going to need a larger budget."

"event","So, an interesting debate came up yesterday.  Interesting as in a foolproof time-waster!  Who would win in a fight between Sonic the Hedgehog, the fastest thing alive and Bucky O'Hare, who goes where no ordinary rabbit would dare.  Now, I think this is hands-down a Sonic victory, but there was some contention.  So I've brought the debate here.  Two animated, strange colored anthropomorphic protagonists enter, one animated, strange colored anthropomorphic protagonist leaves.  Welcome to Randomdome!  Let's look at the stats:

What's going on around me right now:
So, I'm sitting in the SLR surrounded by lots of food for West Indian Mellows.  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sgtpoliteness/"">sgtpoliteness</a> gave us an interesting interpretation of a scary, scary dance to this random ""My Boy Lollipop""  song that was playing.  The event has settled down and episodes of Dilbert are being played in the background.  Further in the background is fire being spun out the back door.  Other than that, it's been a nice, lazy day.


What's going on in general?
So I've spent some time looking over this LJ stuff and wondering whether or not I should register this domain name I really want.  Also, I couldn't find a good picture to put with this profile, so I scoured the computer and found this fun little picture of <a href=""http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/index.html"">HP Lovecraft</a> looking on in horror.  I'm going to figure out some more stuff to do with this LJ later."

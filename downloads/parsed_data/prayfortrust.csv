"event","Luke is still fucking with my brakes. I have no idea how long this is going to take. Is it supposed to take this long? I keep hearing swearing from the parking lot. That can't be a good sign.

Class was okay. I seriously hate English. I don't think I'm going to pass this class well. I just don't read fast enough. My film history class is going well though. I still have no idea, really, what I want to do with my life. I think I want to be a film critic or somehow be able to kind of use my passion. But, I don't know. Or maybe I could go into computers. I'm not sure. 

Luke's out of college already. He says I just gotta do whatever. I don't know what that means. It pisses me off when he's cryptic like that. That's prolly the biggest difference between us. We pretty much look the same, some people think we're twins, but then I open my mouth and he opens his mouth and becomes pretty clear real quick which one of us has which personality. Luke is the laid back one and I'm the planner. I worry. He just lets shit happen and when it goes down bad, he figures it's about the same as if it'd go down good. I can't do that. I gotta know. 

I think LOST is on tonight. I like that show."

"event","Luke's fixing my car today. It's making screeching noises and he says that means it's time to replace the brakepads. I don't really care.

I'm off to school now."

"event","Hey. My name is Dakota Johnson. I'm here because I needed a place to be able to talk about my sins and my successes. I want to fight for myself and for everyone like me because I know that there are people like me. 

I'll make it short and sweet. For the last five years, I've been in a sexual relationship with my brother, Luke. 

The first thing people say when I tell them that, assuming we get that far, is ""He's abusing you."" The funny thing is, this is so far from abuse that I can't even begin to explain it. He's my older brother, sure, and he's in a position of power over me, sure, but  the first thing I say is that this was completely mutual.

I can hear the next question in my head, ""Why?"" 

I grew up in an abusive home. My father was physically (though not sexually) abusive to all the members of my family. Eventually, my mother left. We were with him and we had to get used to taking care of eachother. We got used to making food happen, cleaning the house and relying on eachother for any emotional support we needed.

Sex just sort of happened. It didn't happen all at once like most people think. It started with sleeping in the same bed. We did it when my father sold one of the beds for some money for alcohol. He only got ten bucks for it but it was enough. So we shared a bed. I remember waking up to feeling Luke aroused behind me and turning around and falling back asleep.

Kissing came next. It felt natural really. After kissing, came touching. Then, fucking. And here I am. 

I'm here to talk about my brother and about how nothing comes between me and my brother."

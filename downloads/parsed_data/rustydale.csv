"event","A crisis struck in Action Figure Land today when I brought home a package of green Peeps. The Librarian very understandably decided they were a threat, but most of the rest of the toys really liked them. Peeps are exotic, both soft and grainy -- textures most action figures don't get to experience very often. Unfortunately, the Librarian managed to ally himself with the My Little Pony, and with size, hooves, <i>and</i> opposable thumbs on their side, along with the fact that the weapons they faced were plastic, they rounded up all the peeps and most of the toys. They chained them together <strike>with yarn</strike> and were all set to drive the <strike>snakes</strike> Peeps from <strike>Ireland</strike> Action Figure Land. It was looking grim for the Peeps, Tiny Han, Tiny Luke, Tiny R2, Donkey, Baby Goat, and Penguin.

But! Captain Jack, Rose, Tiny Leia, One-Armed Willow and Oz had a plan. Luckily they were experts at hiding in foliage, so they remained completely unseen in a Christmas cactus while the slave train got on its way. Then they stood around and waited for K-9 to enact the whole plan, which involved pulling the yarn back and forth very quickly so that it worked up static electricity, sparked, and jumped right off of the captives. (Science is special in Action Figure Land.) With everyone distracted, Jack and Rose tackled the Pony, Oz played a song on his guitar to draw away the Peeps (very pied piper), and Willow reasoned with the Librarian. Tiny Leia made sure the other captives were okay.

In the end, the Librarian agreed to a less drastic solution. Again, K-9 was key. Most people don't know that when wool/synthetic blend yarn is electrified twice in a row, the polarity of its neutron flow reverses and it can be used to transport small synthetic objects through time and space. All they had to do was put the Peeps inside a circle of yarn, and ZAP, they were sent back to their home planet, Peeprica. Hooray!

"event","After their disappointing <a href=""http://rustydale.livejournal.com/14914.html"">quest through the wilderness</a> for the wrong Blue Box, the Plastic Captain, Plastic Rose, and tiny K-9 took their silver Honda landcruiser a long distance to a new place. The Captain called it a ""base of ops"" and Rose called it a ""bloody huge flat.""

In their headquarters on a muslin covered table, which for some reason the Captain insisted on called ""the Hub,"" the trio discovered some heavy, smooth, round objects of several different colors. They inspected one.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0543.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

Rose bent her head with some difficulty and rubbed her cheek against the object. ""It feels like those rocks I fell on,"" she observed. 

""But it's round,"" the Captain countered. None of them had ever seen a round stone. In their experience, stones were angular and pokey.

CORRECTION, MASTER. IT IS OVOID, said K-9. Jack was a little annoyed, feeling that ""round"" was close enough, but he kept silent.

EGGS ARE OVOID, K-9 added.

""An egg?"" Rose said thoughtfully. ""That's... a bit creepy. Look how many there are. What if they hatched?""

""K-9, can you analyze them?"" the Captain asked.

NEGATIVE, CAPTAIN, MY CIRCUITS ARE PLASTIC.

""Oh, well, watch them for any signs of... loss of integrity, will you? Just in case they <i>are</i> eggs, we don't want the Hub turning into a nursery. Or battleground,"" he added, thinking of all the things an egg could contain.

K-9 watched.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0544.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

The Captain and Rose decided to climb down and have a look around. Rose had spotted some interesting-looking boxes on the floor sporting life-sized advertisements of a variety of men. For some reason she was drawn to them.

They shimmied down the leg of the table, but quickly found that the surface on the lower level was soft and very hard to stand in.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0545.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

However, as often happens in life, they found that hanging onto one another for support helped their balance greatly. They turned their attention to the first box.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0547.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

It showed three men, one of whom frightened Rose and made the Captain laugh out loud. The other two were strange-looking but gave Rose no other clues. She did notice the writing, though.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0548.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

""Why does it say 'Doctor'?"" She wondered. ""Doctor who? Not <i>our</i> Doctor, whoever he is?""

""I doubt it,"" the Captain agreed, ""but you're right, it's quite a coincidence to find the name here."" They continued to the next box.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0549.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

Suddenly the Captain's entire body felt gooey with the warmth of shock. The picture on this box showed <i>Rose</i>, but it was the man pictured next to her that made his joints thicken. There was <i>something</i> about that man.

""Jack!"" Rose stopped usinghis title in moments of stress. ""Look! It's... I'm sure that's the box from my dreams! Police Box! It's blue!""

But it was just a photograph, after all, and they didn't know what to do with the information yet, so they continued to the third box, gripping one anothers' arms stiffly but with feeling.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0551.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

This poster showed Rose again, but with another man. The new man was rather cheeky-looking. Jack didn't like him, and felt strangely protective of the Rose in this third picture. 

Plastic Rose was adding things up. ""Jack,"" she said quietly, ""all three of these boxes say 'Doctor. 'They're all different men, but two of them show me, and two have the Blue Box. What's going on?"" She finished almost plaintively. ""I don't like it.""

Jack agreed. ""It's like we've almost found what we're looking for, but at the same time it's not even close. I've got a bad feeling, too. What's in these boxes?""

They moved to investigate more closely, but the boxes were quite secure, and the two ended up losing their balance again. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0552.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

By this time, K-9, having judged the Mystery Eggs safe for the moment, had found a way down and joined them. The moment he saw the three boxes, he popped a panel.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0553.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

THESE ARE ALL DOCTORS, he said flatly but somehow betraying surprise at the same time.

""We figured out that much, you brilliant tin box,"" Jack said, helping Rose up off the carpet. ""But they're not *our* Doctor, are they?""

THEY ARE NOT REAL, K-9 confirmed.

""So we keep searching,"" Jack said, nodding as much as his neck joint would allow. ""I just wish I knew what these boxes were for.""

The three returned, with considerable difficulty to the Hub, where Jack and Rose tried to relieve the stress of the outing with their favorite activity, Doing the Splits While Holding Hands. K-9 watched protectively.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v232/littledoglaughd/AFs/AFjack-rose/DSCF0554.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""><br><br>

High above, other action figures were watching the drama unfold. In particular, one called Giles and another called Willow, veterans of many <a href=""http://rustydale.livejournal.com/11650.html"">plasticene</a> <a href=""http://rustydale.livejournal.com/12271.html"">existential</a> <a href=""http://rustydale.livejournal.com/12494.html"">crises</a>, smiled to themselves and shook their heads sadly. The revelations for these new Plastic people were going to get more painful before they started making sense.

After smuggling themselves out of the hotel room in some luggage, then stowing away on several airplanes which the Captain insisted he could have flown if they weren't trying to be so secretive, the Captain and Rose found themselves in an area of rural America. It seemed as good a place as any to begin searching for the Doctor, so they procured seats in a silver Honda landship and rode around with their painted eyes peeled, so to speak.

On their first day out, Rose spotted, far in the distance, Something Blue. She revealed to the Captain that she had been having dreams about a particular shade of blue, and it seemed like paint on wood. They decided to follow the clue. It took them to the road up a mountain, which also happened to be blue.

<lj-cut text=""Mountain Quest"">The first time they were able to disembark, Rose and the Captain quickly became separated. Jack searched the mountainside frantically. 

""ROSE!"" he shouted as loud as he could from the top of a cliff, disturbing a beetle nearby.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pek13/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pek13/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""348"" border=""0"" /></a>


But Rose could not hear him. She was lying senseless on a cliff ledge far below. Tiny plastic boots do not promote agility, as it turns out. 

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pf81k/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pf81k/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""478"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a>


Fortunately, K-9 had joined the search. <small><b>'I HAVE FOUND ROSE, MASTER,'</b></small> he announced, and his projection was surprisingly good across the canyon that separated him from the Captain.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pgwqb/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pgwqb/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a>


The Captain eventually found his way around and climbed down to help Rose. 

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002phys0/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002phys0/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a><


""I am dashing and heroic! Look at my uniform!"" he reassured her after waking her gently. ""I am strong and manly, trust me!""&nbsp; They climbed up together.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pk7ee/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pk7ee/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a>


The climb was exhausting.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pp609/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pp609/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Later, when the Honda landcruiser had reached the top of the mountain, K-9 used his navigation technology to lead them across a ridge. Fortunately, there was already a trail carved in the direction they needed to go.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pza13/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pza13/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a><


Still, it was steep and fairly treacherous for people six inches high with only eight points of articulation.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002p59g0/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002p59g0/s640x480"" alt=""Lover&#39;s Leap trail"" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


In fact, during one climb, the Captain found himself hanging with no more footholds. <

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pqs6f/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pqs6f/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


""I thought you were dashing and strong and manly,"" Rose called back down to him. ""Can't you get yourself up?"" The Captain uttered exclamations that were neither dashing nor heroic.<

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pra2y/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pra2y/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


""Okay, grab my hands,"" Rose offered, lying on her stomach and risking scratching her paint on the rock to help him. ""Wait, just one hand, otherwise you'll fall.""<

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pscxs/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pscxs/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Either Rose was surprisingly strong or the Captain was made of surprisingly light, tough material, because Rose had no trouble pulling him up. He was very tired from his ordeal and simply had to rest with his head in her lap for some time.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pt11b/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pt11b/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Meanwhile, K-9 kept watch, yielding to neither Virginia creeper nor poison ivy.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pw6e6/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pw6e6/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Finally, the group made it to the end of the trail, where they could survey the entire valley for Rose's blue object. K-9, using a built-in electrotelescope, spotted a blue, boxlike thing miles below and noted the coordinates. He was about to turn away when he decided to zoom in a little closer.

<small><b>'MISTRESS, THE BOX READS: Porta-John.&nbsp; I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE OBJECT WE SEEK.'</b></small>

Rose, after searching her hopeful plastic heart, asking if the sign on the John object said anything about a Smith, and being told <b><small>'NEGATIVE,'</b></small> was forced to agree. The group was rather dejected.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pxha8/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pxha8/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a>


The Captain, however, had noticed dozens of carvings in the wood of the landing they were standing on. Most of the carvings were of the [boy] + [girl] = [heart] variety, leading him to believe this must be the fabled Lovers Leap. To cheer Rose up and honor the place, Captain Jack insisted they practice their dancing some more.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pywzh/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002pywzh/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


When they had reached lower altitude again, the Captain snuck away to stand on the edge of something very high.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002q4ce1/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002q4ce1/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Rose spotted him and climbed up after him, mentally preparing arguments to convince him not to jump. In her worry, she called him ""Jack"" for the first time.

However, it turned out he had picked the spot merely for its suitability for brooding.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002q2r8y/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002q2r8y/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Once the brooding was accomplished, Rose joined the Captain and they stood together in what they thought was probably a very heroic stance. It made them feel heroic, anyway, and then they were off to continue their mission, sure that someday, they would find the Doctor.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002q1z0p/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002q1z0p/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>"

Unfortunately, soon after meeting and discovering their purpose, AFs Captain Jack and Rose investigated and discovered further that they were locked in a giant hotel room. They decided to use their time of incarceration to explore their bodies. 

<lj-cut text=""Stuck in the hotel"">""Look, Captain, I can do the splits!"" Rose said with delight, demonstrating. She promptly fell forward onto her face. ""But I guess I need to work on balance.""

The Captain tried and found that he, too, could do the splits; but his difficulty was falling backwards. The two were forced to grasp hands to stay upright while they practiced balancing, presumably for a future time when they would be ""served"" by a gymastic dance team.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gqhgx/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gqhgx/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a>


<strong>Threatdown: BEARS</strong>
The two were so wrapped up in <strike>each other</strike> practicing the splits they don't notice the smiling plush giant behind them. K-9 noticed, however, and would have sounded the alert but for the curious scarf the bear wore. It aroused in K-9 electronic impulses that in an organic life form would have been an unplaceable sense of nostalgia. K-9 settled for making friends with the bear, whose name was Beatrice.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gr740/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gr740/s640x480"" alt=""Threatdown: BEARS"" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Later, Beatrice returned, evidently after taking a walk in a tropical paradise (or possibly a hothouse). Rather than questioning the bear about how she escaped from the hotel room, Rose (who wasn't yet well-practiced in the ways of action/adventure) procured a flower from her.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gyxhg/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gyxhg/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""360"" border=""0"" /></a>


Rose decided to give Captain Jack her flower.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gwke1/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002gwke1/s640x480"" alt="""" height=""480"" width=""640"" border=""0"" /></a>


The Captain accepted.

<strong>Good dog.</strong>
Later, K-9 was unable to locate the two action figures, but he remained to <strike>belatedly</strike> guard Rose's flower.

When the Captain and Rose showed up again, they noticed music coming from the adjoining hotel room and took the opportunity to try dancing, presumably in preparation for a time when they would be ""served"" by a nasty team of ballroom dancers.<

On August 11, 2007, two small plastic people awoke surrounded by colorful paper board and several large, transparent plastic shields. They tried to introduce themselves to one another but found they did not know their own names--or much of anything. 

""Like, what is this place? How did we get here?"" the female said, trying to stand and finding herself quite stiff. The ground was too soft to support her. ""And what do I look like?""

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002h24s0/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002h24s0/s320x240"" alt="""" height=""240"" width=""180"" border=""0"" /></a>
<font size=""-2""><i>The female looked serious.</i></font>

""You look fantastic,"" the male said appreciatively, raising a painted eyebrow, and then they caught one another's eyes and stared for a moment, as if a memory had been triggered. 

""Say that again,"" said the girl. 

""What? You look great. Now how about me?""

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002h1kk4/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002h1kk4/s320x240"" alt="""" height=""240"" width=""180"" border=""0"" /></a>
<font size=""-2""><i>The man looked almost as serious, but with poutier lips.</i></font>

""No, that isn't what you said. You said FANTASTIC."" 

They both shivered in their plastic clothes.

But the moment passed without revelation.

The man rolled over to attempt standing and discovered it was easier if he used one of the colorful boards. Once he was standing, he had a better view of the decorations. 

""Hey, would ya look at that. It's you! And I think your name is K-9. Do you have 'PULL BACK & GO' Motion?""

The girl had no idea if she could pull back & go, as she was having difficulty managing to stand at all. She finally made her way across the soft surface to the board where the man was standing, then wrinkled her plastic nose. 

""Is that what I look like? My roots are showing.""

The man looked at her critically. ""Yup. That's you. But don't worry about the hair. You're a real doll."" This made the girl smile.

""Are you sure about the name? What's that... thing behind me, with the antennae? Is that Rose?""

""A mechanical fly or something? I don't know. More importantly, is there a picture of me around here?""

They moved two of the transparent screens with some difficulty, but didn't have to search long before they found a board with a picture of the man.

""Jack Harkness!"" the man said triumphantly. ""Now that's a good solid name. And I'm a captain!""

K-9 attempted to salute him good-naturedly but found her arms didn't bend quite that way. She began reading the boards in more detail.

""What's this about a CHOKING HAZARD, Captain?"" she wondered aloud.

""Mmm, probably means we have to be careful when we eat,"" he said wisely. ""What I'm more concerned about is this 'sonic blaster accessory' I'm supposed to have. Have you seen it?""

K-9 had been about to ask about the large, attractive label ""DOCTOR WHO"" below the Captain's name, but she let that go and helped the Captain search for his gun. While they were attempting to lift a piece of board together, suddenly a loud voice behind them made K-9 yelp and the Captain drop the board.

<font size=""-2""><b>'HELLO MASTERS. I HAVE FOUND THE SONIC BLASTER YOU SEEK.'</b></font> 

They turned around, K-9 panting in her partially-unbuttoned shirt, and discovered the metal fly from the picture. Now it looked more like... they weren't sure until K-9 saw the collar around its neck.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002h3asa/g105""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/002h3asa/s320x240"" alt="""" height=""240"" width=""320"" border=""0"" /></a>

""Hello, you cute thing, are you a doggy?"" she said to it.

With a mechanical whir, the creature backed up an inch. <font size=""-2""><b>'THE DIMINUTIVE LABEL YOU CHOOSE IS CORRECT, MISTRESS. I AM A DOG.'</b></font> Then it returned to its original point. <font size=""-2""><b>'I HAVE FOUND THE BLASTER. COME.'</b></font> 

It swung around, spun its wheels for a few seconds in a fold of the very soft ground, gained traction, and took off. The Captain and K-9 followed it back to one of the transparent screens, where the gun was secured tightly with a large piece of wire. The Captain tried to remove it but found his fingers were not dexterous enough for the job. ""K-9, you want to have a go?""

The girl and the mechanical dog moved forward at the same time. The dog's head rotated to look at the girl. <font size=""-2""><b>'I AM K-9, MISTRESS.'</b></font> If it had been anyone else, its tone would have said, ""I'm surrounded by idiots."" 

The girl laughed. ""Kay-nine,"" she sounded out. ""Right. Well that's much better, I must be Rose!"" She shook hands with the Captain as if introducing herself, then gave the dog a pat on the head. ""It's nice to meet you, K-9.""

The real K-9 was able to use a cutting tool to make short work of the wire securing the blaster. The Captain held the gun in his hand, looking pleased. But K-9 was not ready to relax. He swung around to face both of his new friends.

<font size=""-2""><b>'NOW WE MUST FIND THE DOCTOR.'</b></font> 

The Captain and Rose looked at each other with amazement. ""The Doctor!"" they said simultaneously, for all at once the memories had come flooding back."

"event","Regular Xander's report on the latest episode of SG-1, ""Babylon.""  Military Xander and Magic Box Anya  watched with him this week.

<lj-cut text=""Power and benevolence, faith vs. proof""><b>R Xander:</b> Well, it was kind of predictable and boring again unless you like shirtless men--
<b>MB Anya:</b> It was the best episode yet.
<b>R Xander</b>: --or you like Jaffa culture.
<b>Military Xander:</b>  It was pretty interesting.  And you're not lying about the shirtless men.  Mitchell, um...
<b>MB Anya:</b> How about that Jaffa in the Army basement hospital thingy place?  He had even prettier boobs  than Cordy.
<b>Willow:</b> Xander, can't you at least get her to call them 'pectoral muscles'?
<b>Giles:</b> Yes yes, well, this is all... appalling, and I'd like to hear more about Jaffa culture later, but  let's get to the point.  Was there mention of this, ah, 'Origin' religion?
<b>R Xander:</b> That's what I was trying to say if my pervy girlfriend would shut up--
<b>MB Anya:</b> You're just sulking because Vala isn't on anymore.
<b>R Xander:</b> (ignoring her) --that the Priors have been wiping out more planets of people who refuse to  worship the Ori.  But these super-secret special Jaffa on this one planet, they escaped the Goa'uld and  they've been isolated for hundreds of years worshipping, get this, the Ancients.
<b>Giles:</b> Are these Goa'uld important?
<b>R Xander:</b> Uh... I guess you just need to know they made slaves out of the Jaffa and forced everybody to  worship them as gods.
<b>Oz:</b> And they held power by...
<b>R Xander:</b> Being mean bastards.
<b>Giles:</b> Power.
<b>R Xander:</b> Yeah, basically.  Stolen technology, lies.  Nothing supernatural about them. So anyway, these  special Jaffa rejected the Goa'uld as false gods and decided the Ancients were the real deal.  But after  all this time their leader, the one Mitchell met, starts getting antsy because they pray to the Ancients  but the Ancients never reveal themselves.  And of course then a Prior shows up in the flesh, does all  his hocus pocus with the healing and the crops, and the Jaffa leader really likes all this.  He knows  the Ori aren't Ancients, but they're *right there*. And they're powerful. They're some kind of god.
<b>Oz:</b> But not the right kind of god.
<b>R Xander:</b> Right, that's what Mitchell said. He said they're not worthy because of how they *use* their  power, force people to worship them by doing bad stuff. He says people shouldn't suffer for their faith.
<b>Giles:</b> So this fellow defines ""god"" as one who has a certain amount of a certain kind of power, but  believes that only benevolent gods should be worshipped.
<b>Oz:</b> Or at least that malevolent ones shouldn't be.
<b>R Xander:</b> Mitchell wanted those guys to go back to worshipping the Ancients even though the Ancients don't talk  back.
<b>Giles:</b> Things unseen.  Fascinating. These Jaffa fellows reject one god as a mortal trickster, embrace  another on faith, only to abandon that one for a god who is less distant but more cruel.
<b>R Xander:</b> Yup.
<b>Oz:</b>  The religion vacuum.  It gets filled one way or another.
<b>Willow:</b>  But some people don't believe in any gods, right?
<b>Giles:</b>  Individuals, yes.  But I believe Oz is right: whole societies, cultures with a habit of  religion, I doubt they can survive without worshipping *something*, even if it's not a god per se.
<b>Willow:</b> And something you can see is better than something you can't see, even if it's a mean something?
<b>Giles:</b> Well, I suppose that's the question.  Xander, you mentioned that your ""Stargate"" program said  something about faith?
<b>R Xander:</b> Oh, right.  Yup.  Mitchell went on about it to the Jaffa leader guy.  He said Earth people  never needed proof of their gods' existence in order to believe in them.
<b>Giles:</b> Ah.</lj-cut>

AF Willow, AF Cordelia, and the Anyas have had a tough couple of weeks, what with their research assignments covering the internet, non-sci fi television, and radio.  Willow is worried about all the action figures in New Orleans who may be covered with toxic muck.  She's convinced (rightly so, though I didn't say it) that nobody's going to take care of the stranded action figures, and she wanted to start doing science experiments with polluted water to see how it reacts with plastic and paint, but Giles and Military Xander stepped in.  It was a little tense for awhile, though."

"event","It's busy at Casa Rusty these days.  I come home and the TiVo remote has been moved, books from the metal shelf are out of place, new bookmarks have appeared on my Foxfire browser.  The Action Figures are beelike.

They meet almost every night to share what they've found.  Military Xander and Faith work together with a matchbox they found and light the candle in the blue holder, and they sit or lie around it, being careful not to get within meltin-distance.  I think Oz has sat down and watched all the <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> episodes I have on the TiVo (all of Season 2 so far), and the other night he and Military Xander started to inform the others about the most recent episode.  Even I hadn't seen it yet, so I took some risk eavesdropping on their conversation.  

<b>AF Oz:</b> I think what we need to concentrate on are the Colonists' mythology and the Cylons' religion.
<b>Fiesta Giles:</b> (intrigued) Why do you call one a mythology and the other a religion?  Is that how it's presented?
<b>M Xander:</b> The first one just... sounds older?  Some of them really believe it though.  And there's some sort of magicky stuff like when Willow starts burning sage...

Giles wanted to know what Xander meant by ""older"" and Oz started to describe the ancient stories and writings versus the Cylons' apparent concept of a single, living God.  They ended up watching it again so Giles could see for himself (Willow joined them), and he got very excited by the names he was hearing, and the next day I noticed my copy of Edith Hamilton's <i>Mythology</i> was taken down and a bunch of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> bookmarks on my computer.  Tonight they talked it out briefly in council.

<lj-cut text=""Overview of BSG religion - spoilers through Home, Part 2""><b>Giles:</b> Kobol was the home of the gods?
<b>Oz:</b> Lords of Kobol. Zeus, Apollo, Hera, Athena, Artemis, and Aphrodite, maybe more.  
<b>Military Xander:</b> And humans lived there.
<b>Oz:</b> Worshipping the gods, everything was ducky.
<b>M Xander:</b> There was even a pretty opera house!
<b>Giles:</b> But then the humans abandoned it.  
<b>AF Willow:</b> (it must have been she who did the internet portion of the research for Oz) After getting pretty depraved, well, according to the Cylons anyway. There was some kind of attack or war or something, too. Two thousand years ago.
<b>Giles:</b> Twelve colonies.
<b>Willow:</b> Thirteen.  They went out and found new planets, and they lost Kobol, and they also lost Earth for some reason, the thirteenth colony.  But they had an oracle named Pythia, or they had her scrolls from 1600 years before, anyway.  So they know things like ""All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again""--
<b>Oz:</b> History is cyclical.
<b>Willow:</b> --and the fact that there's a place on Kobol that will show the way to Earth if you take the right sacred object in with you.
<b>Buffy:</b> The arrow of Apollo.
<b>AF Faith:</b>  ::snort:: Apollo can take his own arrow.
<b>Giles:</b> But the planet is in ruins now.  
<b>M Xander:</b> After the colonials left, Athena was so upset she jumped off a cliff.  Zeus or one of them saw it and made the tomb for her.  And put some kind of magic map inside.
<b>Giles:</b> Activated by the brother's arrow.
<b>Willow:</b> That was cool, with the Stonehenge and the grass and the stars.  But um, well, we don't know if Apollo was Athena's brother.  We don't know if they were gods or people or just stories.  The Cylons know a lot about them, though.
<b>AF Cordelia:</b> But the Cylons have one god.
<b>Oz:</b> Right, but they're interested in the colonists' religion.  I think they can use it to manipulate them or something.  To the Cylons, God is one being, and he's perfect.  His first children were imperfect, abandoned him for their superstitious polytheism, and became very unworthy, but they created a new generation of children who *are* perfect, or very close.  
(All the other AFs pause for a moment to absorb the fact that Oz has just narrated such a long passage.)
<b>Giles:</b> And the children want to kill their parents.
<b>Oz:</b> To eliminate imperfection, possibly.  But first they have to perfect themselves.
<b>Buffy:</b> By making themselves more human.
<b>Oz:</b> Ironic, huh?  They can't fulfill the commandment to multiply unless they experience one of the things that makes humans so imperfect: love.
<b>Giles:</b> Well, this concept of one god certainly gives the Cylons a more unified purpose.  The colonists seem quite... scattered and unsure.
<b>Cordelia:</b> They *are* older. 
<b>MB Anya:</b> I bet it's that KILL ALL HUMANS robot thing that's giving the Cylons purpose.
<b>Oz:</b> We'll see.
<b>Buffy:</b> So... we're eventually going to talk about the fact that these children of humans have consciousness.  Right?
<b>Cordelia:</b> Yeah!
<b>Willow:</b> And possibly souls?</lj-cut>

I think the main website Willow used was this <a href=""http://battlestarwiki.org/index.php?title=Sacred_Scrolls"">Battlestar Wiki</a>.  Regarding the last part of their conversation, I want to refer them to one of the earlier episodes, but I think I'll write it out in a post of my own first."

"event","Unlike <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/rustydale/13010.html#cutid2"">last week's ""Beachhead"" experience</a>, most of the AFs didn't tune in to <i>Stargate SG-1</i>this week, and Regular Xander didn't have much to report. In fact he was pretty bored by the whole episode.&nbsp; Cordelia wasn't, entirely.

<lj-cut text=""Ex Deus Machina""><u>9x07 ""Ex Deus Machina""</u>
<b>AF Cordelia:</b> This week was about Gold Head!
<b>R Xander:</b> Teal'c.&nbsp; I keep telling you.
<b>Cordelia:</b> Fine.&nbsp; It was about Talc.&nbsp; Oh my god, he got to talk!&nbsp; His voice gives me shivers.&nbsp; But he was wearing these damn layered robes half the time.

AF Willow, listening from atop the TV stand, was glad to hear a little bit about Sam's personal life and therefore didn't mind the artless exposition.&nbsp; (She thinks of herself as a fellow scientist, so she digs Carter.)&nbsp; Though she was curious about the ""not-single"" part.

<b>Willow:</b> I don't understand why they don't say who she's with.
<b>R Xander:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, that's pretty dumb, but if you don't already know, I'm not telling you.</lj-cut>

My favorite thing, though, was Magic Box Anya's only comment: something to the effect that between Daniel's auctioneer-style exposition and his distracting hotness (I think he occasionally reminds her of Giles, which is odd but also not), she has no chance of understanding what's actually going on in the story."

"event","Some of the Action Figures have begun their <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/rustydale/12666.html?mode=reply"">research assignments</a> already: first was Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico, who, after the last conversation I reported, promptly leaped right off the edge of the TV stand, four and a half feet to her death.  Well, that's what AF Willow must have thought, judging from her shriek.  Really, MCKF hopped halfway down, where there's a stack of stuff next to the TV stand, and then the rest of the way to the (deep, soft) carpet on the second hop.  Willow forgets that what they say about cats applies to the tiny ceramic ones as well, at least on carpet.  MCKF scurried off to find the Fuzz and was apparently successful in her negotiations, because the AFs now have a very nice little rope ladder on which to descend and reascend the TV stand on research trips.  Faith and Military Xander worked together on it, using two cords from the Fuzz's collection of string-type toys.  Impressive, since I wasn't sure they could do something as nimble as tying knots.

<lj-cut text=""Group TV night"">As soon as the ladder was finished, Fiesta Giles headed off on his trek to the study, where the books live.  I'm not sure what he's been up to.  The next thing I heard from the AFs was on Friday evening.  I came back from my wine run to find the entire group of them hanging out on the far side of the couch.  (They were trying to stay out of the way of the Fuzz; while most of them believe he's a *good* cat, not a one of them is foolish enough to think of him as actually *safe*.  ""He's not a tame cat,"" they remind one another.) The were waiting on me so they could watch Stargate: SG-1.  Ha!  How considerate. Willow knows how to use the TiVo remote by now, so they could have started without me.

I thought SG-1 was Regular Xander's assignment, but I got the idea last night that the rest of them were either curious about the show from Xander's description or bored with life four feet off the floor.  So they made this week's episode a group activity.  It was rather festive, especially when I broke out the cheap wine (just for me--can you imagine what kind of alcohol tolerance a 3 ounce toy would have?) and cut up an apple into very small pieces.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the foresight to set some viewing ground rules, and the buggers talked through the entire episode.  None of them had actually seen the show before, so they were full of questions.  It turns out (I should have realized this) even R Xander hasn't actually *seen* the show.  He has, however, apparently listened very closely to every episode I've ever watched.  What a geek.  I gave them all a boost onto the couch, and as usual I sat on the floor with a cushion.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Stargate 9x06: Action Figure commentary"">This is how it went down while we watched <i>Stargate: SG-1</i> 9x06, ""Beachhead"":

<b>Regular Xander:</b> Huh.  I expected Jaffa to be so much more... built. 
<b>Magic Box Anya:</b>  They're looking a little sickly, aren't they?  They have those laser stick thingies though.
<b>Military Xander:</b>  Uh oh.  Lot of good that did them.  They should get some of the blue stone, ah, ""stick thingies"" instead.  Can they stage a raid of some sort?
<b>R Xander:</b> Staffs, I think, and no.  Shut up, you'll see.

<b>AF Cordelia:</b> What's wrong with that old guy's eyebrows--HELLO.  Basketball.  Oh my god, the Gold Head guy can dunk my basketball anytime.

The rest of the action figures use the exposition about Nerus to ponder what exactly is the ""basketball"" in Cordelia's scenario, and what ""dunking"" would involve.  From the look on her face, Willow thinks there should be a ""hoop"" in there somewhere, but she keeps quiet about it.

<b>M Xander:</b> He's a TV person, sweetie.
<b>Cordelia:</b> Whatever, he has to have an action figure at least. Willow, get on the internet tomorrow and find out.
<b>Willow:</b> I'm glad to see you're dealing so well with the fact that we can be purchased. With *credit cards*.
<b>Cordelia:</b> Pbbbblt.  Get over it.  LOOK at those arms.
<b>R Xander:</b> Not bad.  Looks like Mitchell hasn't joined the Black Tank Top club yet though. (explaining to the others) He's kind of a fawning outsider.
<b>MB Anya:</b> Which arms?  I like all the arms.  Look at the one with the scruffy face.  (There may have been drool at this point.)
<b>Bunny Anya:</b> Do they play basketball on this show a lot?
<b>Cordy:</b> Oh god.  Pecs! Shoulders!

For the rest of the episode I notice Military Xander watching both Vala and Mitchell very closely, with an expression that says, ""How long before they get back into sleeveless shirts?""

<b>Faith:</b>  State secret. Seedless grapes. ::snorts::  Somebody needs to take that piggy to market.
<b>Oz:</b> (grimly) He's trouble.
<b>Cordy:</b>  Oh, good, another tight teeshirt.  Gold Head, you will be mine.

(Landry on the phone with Jack)
<b>R Xander:</b> Sam's going to be standing behind him.
<b>Willow:</b> How do you know that?
<b>R Xander:</b> I've watched, well, heard any TV before ever.  There.  See?
<b>Cordelia:</b>  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
<b>Giles:</b> Her hair *is* rather unfortunate.
<b>Willow:</b> Oh, she has a cute smile, though!

<b>Oz:</b> They're being dismissive of the dark-haired woman. Remember this.
<b>Cordelia:</b> ""Die."" Ha ha!  All Gold Head has to say is one word.  I love laconic men.
(Willow looks alarmed)
<b>R Xander:</b> That's good, because one word is about all Teal'c gets these days.
(SG-1 2.1/team power shot walking through the Gate)
<b>MB Anya:</b> That was both inspiring and aesthetically pleasing!

<b>Buffy:</b> ""Shaft""?  (cracks up)
<b>Military Xander:</b> Mark Nine? You'd think they could come up with a better name than that.
<b>Faith:</b> ""Gatebuster"" is a little better.
<b>Military Xander:</b> Not much.  Oh...  I like when that woman says ""darling.""
<b>Cordelia:</b> I think you like when she says anything. 

Willow and Oz mediate Cordy and Military Xander's brewing tiff by suggesting they both allow each other a TV crush.

<b>Buffy:</b> That ship isn't going to win any beauty contests, is it?
<b>R Xander:</b> It gets the job done though. 

<b>Faith:</b> Rare delicacy.  Bwah!
<b>Bunny Anya:</b> I'm hungry.  Can we have some chicken? I can even smell it cooking.
<b>Faith:</b> I've heard rabbit tastes like chicken.
<b>Bunny:</b> (ears perk up; Just you wait.)

(Note from Rusty: at that point in time, my downstairs neighbors actually were cooking chicken, as evidenced by the strong odor wafting up through our common HVAC shaft.)

<b>Buffy:</b> Piggy is too interested in those nukes.
<b>Oz:</b> Just what I was thinking.

<b>Faith:</b> Oh good grief, just go in a closet and get it over with already.
<b>Cordy:</b> Who? Gold Head is mine.
<b>Faith:</b> No, you nitwit, Jackson and that Vala woman.  
<b>Cordy:</b> Oh. He dislikes her a little too much, doesn't he?
<b>R Xander:</b> Yeah, sometimes what you aren't supposed to like can be really... hot.
(Willow blushes and Oz and Cordy start to feel uncomfortable, though none of them know why.)

<b>Cordelia:</b> Thank TiVo, more tee shirts.
<b>Oz:</b>  The dark haired woman is worried about something.
<b>Willow:</b>  Ooh.  I like it when the blonde lady talks science.
<b>Cordelia:</b>  You're able to ignore her hair, then?
<b>R Xander:</b> Shhh, they're putting on the--
(The team beams down to the surface of the planet)
<b>Cordelia:</b>  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
<b>R Xander:</b> --space suits.
(The team begins walking around.  Most of the Action Figures are giggling so hard that I have to turn on the captions to make sure I can hear the dialogue.)
<b>R Xander:</b> Okay, those arms are kind of silly looking. (crescendo in the laughing)

<b>Oz:</b> They're going to regret the nuke tactic. 

<b>Giles:</b> These Prior chaps are somewhat disconcerting, aren't they?

<b>Buffy:</b> What's the story with these ""Jaffa""?  If they're not on a trust basis with Earth, somebody needs to be working on that.
<b>R Xander:</b> Somebody is.  Well, somebody was.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, it's a whole thing.
<b>Buffy:</b> Gold--I mean Teal'c--is one of them, right?  Why isn't he with them?
<b>R Xander:</b> Up until the end of last season that would have been an easy question to answer.

<b>Military Xander:</b> They talk a lot when they should be doing stuff.
<b>Willow:</b> (almost dreamily) But it's the blonde science lady talking.
<b>Oz:</b> There. There she goes.
<b>Cordy:</b> Xander, your TV girlfriend is--
<b>Oz:</b> Taking matters into her own hands.  You might not want to watch.
<b>R Xander:</b>  Oh, crap.  This obviously isn't going to end well.
<b>Faith:</b> Right, see how worried Daniel is?  Told you.  

(Vala doesn't make it back; Daniel collapses.)
<b>Faith</b>: At least he's got Shaft to comfort him.
<b>R Xander:</b>  We didn't see her die.  She's not dead.
<b>Military Xander:</b> (stops his manly sniffling for a moment) And you know that because...
<b>R Xander:</b> I've watched any sci fi show ever?  Andnow they'll have a few more episodes, then they'll start talking about the Ori again in time for a fall cliffhanger, and maybe in the spring Vala will show up.

<b>Willow:</b> Why doesn't the science lady want to be on her old team?
<b>R Xander:</b> Another very good question.  

(After the show)
<b>Giles:</b> Ah, Xander, to bring this back on task, another question.
<b>R Xander:</b> Shoot.
<b>Giles:</b>  At the beginning, the ragged fellows on the foreign planet were speaking of false gods.  They were formerly ruled by a false god?
<b>R Xander:</b> They called them Goa'uld.
<b>Giles:</b> And how was it determined these, ah, guld were false?
<b>R Xander:</b> They were just humans with smart parasites and a bunch of really cool technology.  They were faking it.
<b>Giles:</b> And how have they determined these Ori are false?
<b>R Xander:</b>  Um. (thinks) Daniel says just because they know more about the universe doesn't mean they're gods.  Although... I think they did sort of create humans.  Oh, and they kill people for not worshipping them.
<b>Giles:</b> But they seem to have a tremendous amount of power, and it doesn't appear to be all technologically-based.
<b>Oz:</b> How are they defining ""god,"" you mean.
<b>Giles:</b>  Yes, precisely.  The forced worship is disturbing, to be sure, but how does that not simply make the Ori *bad* gods?
<b>R Xander:</b> Daniel used to be one... and they used to be, um, kind of pre-humans?  They weren't always glowy fire dudes with creepy blue minions.
<b>Giles:</b> Well, we'll keep this in mind.  I'm not convinced the Jaffa have any reason to reject the divinity of the Ori other than their past bad experience.
<b>Oz:</b> They're ""fool me twice, shame on me"" atheists, then.
<b>Giles:</b> I suppose so.
<b>Magic Box Anya:</b>  Yes, but the important question is, can we expect to see Daniel Jackson in a tank top again.
<b>Cordelia:</b> Mmmmmmm.</lj-cut>"

"event","I'm sorry to have to return to the Action Figures' story right where I left off, which was a very sad scene in Rustydale.  Lots of shell-shocked staring as a result of <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/rustydale/12271.html"">having found out their real origin</a>.  A sad scene indeed.  Magic Box Anya had finished scrubbing her counter and Regular Xander was no longer even humming.  (AF Faith, one of the few unaffected, had settled down with her head against Buffy's daisy-grown gravestone for a peaceful nap.)  The silence was broken only by the occasional tap of Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico's paw on AF Willow's slippery, tear-streaked face, the almost imperceptible swish of tiny plastic weapons whipping through the air behind the wine bottle, and, every few minutes, a question from AF Cordelia: ""Are we done moping yet?""  After the tenth time or so, Xander, still lying on his back, picked up the <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/0008fsy5"">purple peep head</a> and chucked it at Cordy's.  It looked like a bitter little argument was brewing, with Cordy dragging the still-dazed Military Xander into it for not sticking up for her, but just then there was a very authoritative throat-clearing sound from beside the wine bottle.

<lj-cut text=""Hashing it out"">AF Buffy had emerged from her therapeudic training session looking very determined.  ""Gang,"" she addressed them.  She likes addressing them.  None of them seem to mind. Except for Faith, those who were lying down sat up; the others turned to face her. ""This is a bummer.  I know.  I thought... I don't know what I thought.  It just sucks.  But it doesn't change <i>anything</i>.  Understand?  Nothing is different!  We're <i>here</i>, just like we were before.  Okay?""

Silence of a different quality, as they all worked on that thought.  Some of those little guys are pretty smart for solid-headed plastic people, but a plastic brain is a plastic brain.

""Everything is different.""

OF Oz. I should have known. He declined to elaborate, even when directly asked, ""Different from what?"" but I think about half of the AFs who cared about the issue at all agreed with him, based simply on intuition.

If you found out you were something you had never imagined before, would it change everything or nothing?

Eventually Magic Box Anya spoke up.  ""Why <i>do</i> I feel so bad?""  It was a new thing for her, apparently.  She cared why, exactly?  ""So we're copies of the TV people."" 

<b>Willow:</b> Right.  We knew that.
<b>MB Anya:</b> And the TV people were made by humans.
<b>Buffy:</b> Yes. Like us.
<b>Oz:</b> Huh.
<b>MB Anya:</b> What?
<b>Oz:</b> Different creations of the same creators.
<b>Cordy:</b> What? Stop thinking inside your head.
<b>Willow:</b> (igoring Cordy) Oh, right!  Like, we're equal with the TV people?  Not just created in the image of something that was already a creation?

Regular Xander was still feeling very mopey.  ""Creation of a creation of a creation, whatever, we're still the ones who are <i>collectible</i>,"" he said.  Yeah, that has to hurt.  They all knew it, but I think there was an unspoken concensus forming that there was no use speaking of it.  Oz was going somewhere else, regardless.

<b>Oz:</b> Who made them?
<b>MB Anya:</b> Humans?
<b>Willow:</b> Or the kittens! Or the rabbits?
<b>Military Xander:</b> Or the jungle.
<b>Cordy:</b> Or the beach.
<b>Faith:</b> (not sleeping as she appeared) Don't forget leather.
<b>Regular Xander:</b> Maybe it has to do with Origin.

Willow, who paid attention to Xander's hobbies, picked up on the obscure reference.  

<b>Willow:</b> How much <i>Stargate</i> are you watching these days?
<b>R Xander:</b> No, really, there's these dudes, and they say&mdash;
<b>Buffy:</b> Hold on, what are we talking about here?
<b>Willow:</b> Xander's sci fi shows teach him about religion.
<b>Oz:</b> Religion.  Huh.
<b>Cordy:</b> Would you <i>stop</i> that?

Somehow that all led to a discussion about gods and worship; they had heard of the terms, though even Oz had only a vague idea what was involved.  Was worship something that was necessary? Should they worship the human who sculpted them? The human who made the creations in whose image they were sculpted? Humans in general? Something above humans? Was there something above humans? The Great Cat? Buffy and Cordelia felt that with all the new ideas out there, they shouldn't get into anything hastily, so they decided to drop the idea for awhile. Regular Xander kept bringing up robots for some reason. 

Fiesta Giles, still sitting with his back to the wine bottle, had been very quiet through everything, and both Willow and Buffy must have taken note, because I noticed they both looked relieved when he finally spoke.  

""Xander has a point, little as he knows it.  There's also consciousness to be considered, you know.""  Giles reached up to his face as if searching for glasses, but found nothing for his hands to do. ""Sentience, consciousness, the soul..."" He seemed to lose his thought again.

""So this is bigger than us,"" Buffy said, displaying a surprising understading of the concepts Giles had named. ""I mean, yes! This is what I was saying!  Nothing has changed.  We're still us, right where we were.""

Oz looked almost like he wanted to argue that that Giles's comment supported his original point more than Buffy's, but he didn't bother.  For her part, Cordy, was just relieved they seemed to be getting somewhere.

""Good. Bigger.  Okay, what do we do?"" she said, standing up and looking at them all with hands on her plastic hips.

Giles gazed at her.  ""Well, I should think the answer was obvious.  We research.""</lj-cut>

Excellent.  I'm both encouraged and made uneasy by this development.  On one hand, constructive action, yay!  On the other hand, focused research hasn't done them any favors so far.  Think of what they might get into!  And wait til you hear the research assignments they've handed out.  Hoo boy."

"event","<i>Previously in Rustydale, the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/rustydale/11799.html"">action figures decided to figure out where they came from</a>.</i> 

I was gone over the weekend, and I returned to my apartment Sunday night to discover a minor disaster area.&nbsp; The first thing I noticed was my laptop: opened, turned on, still dialed up to the internet, and ominously abandoned.&nbsp; I turned to the study and found the bookshelves looking somewhat ransacked&mdash;books turned down on their spines, <i>Buffy</i> swag knocked on the floor, and my musical carousel horse turned to face the wall.&nbsp; The floor and armchair, which aren't that tidy to begin with these days, were littered with the plastic sacks and collapsed cardboard boxes I store behind the chair for when I want to mail a package.&nbsp; Even more ominously, the window was open a crack and the screen looked a little pushed-out.

<lj-cut text=""I had a feeling the flower-smoking would come to no good."">Back in the main room, I noticed seven large cards splayed out on the floor at the foot of the television stand: the cardboard backings of the packages most of my action figures came in.&nbsp; They were all turned back-side up, each with the name, photo and description of the character and the little insets showing the faces of the action figure series the character was part of.&nbsp; A couple of the cards seemed to have little tears around the edges that I don't remember making myself.

Obviously my cat didn't do all this. The pieces were starting to fall together, so I checked the computer again.&nbsp; My Firefox browser was still up on the task bar.&nbsp;  AF Willow&mdash;it had to be her&mdash;had left a clear trail of tabs.&nbsp; Google search for ""buffy+willow+plastic,"" then <a href=""http://www.entertainmentearth.com/prodinfo.asp?number=SID2010"">an Entertainment Earth page</a>, which must have been the first horrible shock, then <a href=""http://www.entertainmentearth.com/prodinfo.asp?number=DC60559"">another Entertainment Earth page</a>, a Google search for ""Diamond Select Toys,"" and finally <a href=""http://www.diamondselecttoys.com/store/item.asp?ItemNo=4015"">this</a>.

I have to admit, there was a moment where I involuntarily geeked out.&nbsp; They're selling a ""Fear Itself"" Anya with a <i>removeable</i> Bunny suit now? How cool is that?&nbsp; But I got back to the rather important matter at hand.&nbsp; And can I tell you how much I didn't want to check on my action figures at this point?&nbsp; But there was no avoiding it.

On top of the TV stand, as I feared, it was pretty sad sight.&nbsp; Regular Xander was lying on his back staring at the ceiling and clearly wouldn't let anyone talk to him.&nbsp; I think I heard him humming some country song.&nbsp; Military Xander was furiously cleaning his machine gun, which of course is not complicated when the weapon is a solid piece of plastic, but I don't think he knew the difference.&nbsp; Oz and Willow were sitting back to back, each staring into space, tiny puddles collected in the plastic creases of Willow's clothes. Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico was standing in her lap, patting gently at her wet face. *Tap, tap* went the ceramic paw against the plastic face. Magic Box Anya, with no Xander to talk to, was acting much like Military Xander and furiously cleaning her already-clean counter and cash register.&nbsp; Giles was sitting with his back to the blue wine bottle looking very deep in thought, occasionally muttering something to himself that sounded like ""proof of purchase, made in China,"" and I peeked behind the bottle to discover Buffy in the middle of a very complicated-looking training routine involving about six weapons.&nbsp; Only Faith and Cordelia seemed unchanged.&nbsp; Faith was casually whittling stakes out of some twigs she found in the flower arrangement&mdash;she may have actually been whistling&mdash;and Cordelia appeared to be trying to catch her reflection in the patio window.&nbsp; Oh, and don't ask me how I could tell, it's only a general impression, but Bunny Anya just looked hungry.

So. My action figures have found out they are mass-produced toys.&nbsp; Not just fashioned by another being, which probably would have been okay, but <i>manufactured</i> in <i>quantity</i>. I suppose it's like I might feel if I found out I was one of hundreds of the same clone.&nbsp; Poor little buggers.&nbsp; I don't suppose it would do any good right now telling them they're special to <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Guess I'll just have to wait and see how this shakes out.</lj-cut>"

"event","<i>Previously in Rustydale, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/rustydale/11650.html?view=2946#t2946"">the action figures smoked out and started to get existential</a>.</i> 

<lj-cut text=""Still with the homemade joint."">AF Willow wouldn't let it go.  She was very worried, or maybe paranoid.  Who knows what goes on in those little plastic brains anytime, let alone under the influence of dried flowers.

<b>AF Willow:</b> Were we born?
<b>AF Xander:</b> Like Connor?
<b>All:</b> (shudder)
<b>Willow:</b> Poor Darla.
<b>AF Faith:</b> Hello? Evil vampire?
<b>Willow:</b> But she... (starts to cry)
<b>Faith:</b> (tries to comment but starts giggling)
<b>Xander:</b> Leave her alone, Darla... beautiful... (also starts to cry; Magic Box Anya and AF Oz comfort their significant others)
<b>Fiesta Giles:</b> Yes, well, returning to the question at hand --
<b>Faith:</b> (continues to crack up)
<b>Magic Box Anya:</b> Oh brother. Hey, who has the joint?

At that moment Bunny Anya started to giggle, and one by one Military Xander, Buffy, and finally Regular Xander and Giles succumbed to the giggles.  That left only Magic Box Anya&mdash;very annoyed with Xander&mdash;AF Cordelia, AF Oz, and Willow, who was sobbing more and more loudly. By that time I think they had smoked the last of their recreational herb.

<b>MB Anya:</b> Oh BROTHER. You people have got to learn how to hold your flowers. Okay, EVERYBODY STOP!
<b>All:</b> (surprised silence)
<b>MB Anya:</b> I heard that TV Miss Kitty Fantastico got shot to death with an arrow.&nbsp; How do you feel about that?
<b>MCKF:</b> Mew?
<b>Faith:</b> Bwa ha ha ha ha! .....Wait.

That prompted general sniffling noises and a muffled wail from Willow, but it did get the giggling under control.

<b>AF Oz:</b> (returning to the subject) So. Born?
<b>Giles:</b> (wrinkles plastic nose) Of course my brain is a bit fuzzy, but I'd say we were made, rather.
<b>Xander:</b> Like Darla?
<b>Red Pants Buffy:</b> Xander, how many times have you watched those <i>Angel</i> DVDs?  Forget it. Um, Giles, you mean like were we something else, and then a plastic thing came along and bit us, and now we're plastic? <i>Made</i> made?
<b>AF Cordelia:</b> Duh, he means MADE, like MADE IN CHINA.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Right?
<b>Giles</b>: Well, not manufactured of course, but yes, something like that.  I think perhaps we were fashioned. Perhaps everything on earth was fashioned in some manner.

Most of them nodded.  Well, the equivalent of nodding for someone whose neck joint doesn't move up and down. Giles's idea made some kind of sense, though they weren't sure why.  Weed-muddled brains, and all that.

<b>Oz:</b> As what?
<b>Buffy:</b> What what?
<b>Oz:</b> As what were we fashioned? By whom? For what purpose? Are you sure we aren't just later generations of chemical compounds that formed through natural processes?

Silence reined for a minute as their minds were blown like explosions in space.

<b>Willow:</b> We look like the people on TV.
<b>Bunny Anya:</b> Or do they look like US? Maybe they're spinoffs!
<b>Cordelia:</b> (scoffing) Next you'll say that little rabbit was made to look like YOU.
<b>Rabbit:</b> (plastic nose twitching, <i>Someday I will kill you all but right now I'd like some more fern.</i>)
<b>Giles:</b> No, she's quite right, for all we know someone met us while we were in stasis and then created the people on TV out of humans.
<b>Cordelia:</b> This is too confusing.

The Xanders and Faith also tried to process this through their haze. (Eavesdropping, I was across the room and unaffected by the flower smoke, but I still agreed with Cordelia.) Buffy straightened up more than she was, looking determined.

<b>Buffy:</b> Okay, that doesn't answer Oz's questions, but we need to know this.  I don't know why, but it's important.&nbsp; If you each think about it for a minute, you'll realize you think so too.&nbsp; We need to know where we're from. So we can know where we're supposed to be going.  We've been just sitting around on this TV stand for too long with no purpose.
<b>MB Anya:</b>&nbsp; What matters is that we're here now. I don't know about you, but I can decide for myself where I'm going. Hopefully to great business success.
<b>Oz:</b> This may not end well.
<b>Buffy:</b>  I don't care. We're doing it. Gang?

Despite Magic Box Anya's indifference and Oz's misgivings, the action figures decided to take up the quest.</lj-cut>

That was all several days ago.  Over the weekend, they found some answers. The poor things."

"event","TinyGachnar, after weeks of being <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000e7q31/g16"">casually toyed with by AF Faith</a>, escaped by jumping off the TV tower, landing unharmed on the carpet below, hopping with dificulty through the thick pile to the screen door where he snuck out one of the times I was going in and out with the watering can.  That's what AF Willow figured out in her crime scene investigation, anyway.  (AF Giles argued no crime had been committed, but Willow was so eager to use the forensic knowledge she's been compiling&mdash;apparently they all like to watch C.S.I. while I'm out&mdash;that he dropped it.)  Her findings included the note that Gachnar's one-piece, jointless composition made it easier for him to avoid injury but harder to move about in deep carpet.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000e8h9q/g16"">Magic Box!Anya</a>, who arrived in December and has been acting rather chummy with the Fuzz as she negotiates to get him to bring her inventory for her store, accused the Fuzz of being a horrible guard cat.  The Fuzz replied with a disinterested stare that said it's no furr off his paws if a tiny plastic demon decides to take a stroll among the obstacles of fallen birdseed.

I think the AFs had been getting fond of Gachnar, in the way you might come to appreciate a vicious chihuahua: it keeps things interesting, and it's SO CUTE! if you avoid the teeth.  None of them had been outside, though, and most seemed a bit wary.  They've seen the birds out there.  A blackbird or red-bellied woodpecker could carry one of them away easily, and that's saying nothing of the squirrels and the monstrous racoon that's in the habit of visiting each night around 9 p.m.  

It wasn't long before Military Xander, over AF Cordy's protests about squirrel scratches on his face-paint, volunteered to go on the hunt.  He requested that Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico and Bunny, the Gift With Purchase who hitched a ride with Magic Box Anya, accompany him.  Supposedly he has been training them in search, attack, and subduing the enemey, and he wanted them to get some real world experience.

I'm not sure how they all got down; Bunny* (being of the same one-piece plastic construction as Gachnar) could have jumped.  But Willow, still with the missing limb trauma I guess, started freaking out thinking about  Miss Kitty and Military Xander jumping all that way.  I think they ended up improvising a rope out of the fibers of salvaged basket reeds. (AF Buffy's idea; AF Oz's technique.)  M Xander was about to use a plastic sword to widen the tear in the screen the Fuzz had made while going after the racoon, but I stopped him, replaced the duct tape, and let them out the door.  The rest unfolded thusly:

<ol>
<li> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000dg22q/g16"">Bunny hides in the violets.</a>  </li>
<li> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000dh39h/g16"">Where's Bunny?</a> Seriously, does she think Gachnar's going to walk past her patch of the pot?  Good hiding, though. </li>
<li> Military Xander catches a glimpse of black plastic leather above, in the pole bean jungle pot.  He immdiately calls out, ""Fear Demon,"" then drops to his articulated knees and begins to sob, overcome with the emotion of finding a creature that has been sought for so long and no one thought would be seen again.  (Whatever, sissy.) </li>
<li> Miss Kitty, <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000dqycs/g16"">climbing over the lip of the bean pot</a> right in front of the quarry, distracts it while <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000dk51f/g16"">Military Xander approaches silently from behind</a>, plastic boots sinking in the soft wet potting soil.   </li>
<li> Gachnar, knowing all is lost (having failed miserably at inducing fear in the bird and squirrel populations), rushes past Miss Kitty and flings himself to the balcony boards below, evoking a tiny involuntary scream from inside, where AF Willow has been watching anxiously at the window.  A louder scream rings out when Miss Kitty follows him&mdash;but into the soft soil of the next-smaller pot, and again into a still smaller one. Bunny catches it all from her fear demon blind and hops into the action herself. </li>
<li> Kitten and rabbit do Military Xander proud by stopping Tiny Gachnar before he has a chance to take three hops.  MCKF crouches behind his legs, and Bunny leaps up, soundly thumping his chest with her hind feet.  He topples, and <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000ds4dy/g16"">they've got him</a>. </li>
<li> Military Xander <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/rustydog/pic/000drgd2/g16"">moves to the edge</a> to view the action and (feeling a little outdone) offer pointers from above. </li></ol> 
Mission accomplished!

<font size=""-2"">* Bunny doesn't know she's a mild-mannered domestic creature.  When she and Anya were being packaged together, before the box was sealed and they went into stasis, Anya was so afraid of her that she concluded she was some kind of monster designed to attack and kill with fangs and claws, possibly guarding a cave in England.</font>"

"event","This year, the AFs are assembled on top of a new, much sturdier piece of furniture called a TV Stand.  It didn't shake when the VC came calling, and there's plenty of room to spread out.  Also, with them far above the TV, they can't actually *see* what's going on, on the tube.  That has been quite fortunate a couple of times during <i>Angel</i>.  But can't they *hear*, you say?

Right.  And Bunny Anya is especially alert for some reason.  (She loves to listen to the TV, when she's not chattering at Fiesta Giles about schemes for renting <lj user=""TheBigFuzz""> out to other AFs as a hired thug, or becoming a roaming band of high-priced catburglars, famous for their ability to get in through holes and cracks that would confound even a monkey.)  So I had to do something about <i>Angel</i>.  I ended up enlisting AFWillow's help.  She agreed, on the condition she could tell Oz what was going on.  Since Oz isn't exactly a big conversationalist, it was okay with me.  So now, every Wednesday night at 8, Willow casts a deafness spell with a pinch of sleep.  They can't hear the episode, and most of them are nodding off anyway, so they don't notice their deafness.  The others haven't caught on to the fact that Oz starts plumping up his chain-bedecked gravestone every Wednesday at 7:55.

There was one hitch, a pretty big one.  One week back in early February, Willow was a bit late, and she had just finished discreetly performing the spell for all the others as the teaser was starting on the TV.  She was sitting down with Oz's head in her lap (as much of a lap as she can form when her legs don't quite go straight), getting ready to apply a dab of potion to her own forehead, when she heard the voice of Real Cordelia ""downstairs.""  I of course wasn't at all aware of the doings on *top* of the TV.  So I didn't notice when Willow put down her little bottle and sat, for the next hour, listening intently.

Around 9:30, when I stopped crying for a little while, I heard wee sniffling noises coming from the Stand.  At that moment, Action Figure Cordelia shook herself awake and looked over at Willow.  ""What's *your* problem?"" she said in typical style.  Willow burst into nearly hysterical tears, waking Oz, who of course then held her.  The others gathered around, and Giles stooped (with difficulty under the weight of his poncho, which RustyNiece had decreed he wear) and gently asked her what was wrong.  She hiccupped out some story about renewed grief over her missing arm.

""I thought she was finished with that problem,"" Anya said firmly, to no one in particular.  And in a bright, helpful tone, ""Willow, you finished that, remember?""

At that point I stepped in.  I rarely do, but I felt like this situation merited a private sit-down.  Poor AFWillow.  For someone without internal organs, she is terribly tenderhearted.

So far, AFWillow and I have been able to keep the news from the rest of the crew.  It took a few days of puzzled pampering from Oz and some cryptic talks with Giles about the nature of death and reality, but she's dealing pretty well now."

"event","Big action figure news:  the unexpected arrival of The Other[Willow]s.  For now, though, the news is only big to me, because it's going to be awhile before these variously frightening plastic ladies interact with the group, if it happens at all.  

The group is doing well.  They've taken the tumbly ride to Catventureland a few times, packed into their Funbag, where who knows what will touch whose whatever for how long.  After emerging, they have had RustyNiece adventures, of which, despite the usual spells, a couple of them are starting remember bits and pieces.  Hopefully they won't put anything together and wonder why Oz was forced to marry Cordelia or why Xander and Buffy were briefly dating.

The biggest thing that has happened was the introduction of AF Faith and Red Pants Buffy. It was almost a year ago, I believe, just in time for the <i>Buffy</i> finale. I think I reported on it, but without a lot of detail.  

The two didn't actually get along immediately.  I had opened Buffy a few hours before, and it didn't take the group long to warm up to her.  It seemed the gang needed even more distraction, though.  So I freed Faith from stasis and let her climb from my hand onto the bookshelf where the others were, tensely awaiting the something big they could feel was coming (but that I didn't want them to witness).  Alpha female as she is, AF Faith sensed a rival and stalked straight up to Red Pants Buffy before Military Xander had a chance to scramble for his gun or get out so much as a ""State your business.""  The women stood sizing each other up.

<b>AF Faith:</b> So, you're the big stuff around here?  You aren't very big, sister.
<b>AF Buffy:</b>  It's Buffy. And I don't have to be, not that it's any of your business.  Who are you? What are you doing here, anyway?
<b>AF Faith:</b> Faith, been asleep, now I'm not.  You got a problem with that?
<b>AF Buffy</b>No.  I do have a problem with your combat boots, but hey, looking good isn't for everybody.
<b>AF Faith:</b> Yeah?  Well, I'm not the one with legs made of crappy-ass solid red plastic.  Your clothes aren't even painted on!
<b>AF Cordy:</b> She *does* look really hot, Buffy.

None of the action figures had known for sure that their eyebrows could move, but at that comment Xander's furrowed stiffly.  Buffy glared at Cordelia before continuing.

<b>AF Buffy:</b>  At least I don't have nasty black nail polish.  And my boots look *good*.
<b>AF Faith:</b> They'd look better if you had any joints below your knees.  I bet you fall over *real* easy, B. 

AF Faith had of course invoked the action figure's greatest indignity, but she finally crossed the line by reaching up and giving AF Buffy a small, experimental shove.  Then they were at it.  Buffy did actually start to fall, but she grabbed Faith's hair and pulled her down as well.  Faith grunted something about kicking Buffy's genuine plastic ass.  A catfight between tiny molded plastic women with less than 20 joints apiece, rolling around a bookshelf while other plastic people try to avoid getting toppled, is really something to see.  For awhile it looked like Faith's flexible ankles were going to be a match for Buffy's stylish yet slightly more impractical boots.  Cordelia and Xander, both excellent fighters themselves, tried to join in, but Buffy barked at them to stay out of it.  It was only when Bunny Anya, who had been watching from a distance with considerable amusement (one could only guess she wished she had some popcorn), decided to send a real cat into the fray, that things started to cool down.  Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico leaped in yowling her hardest, and if she had no actual ceramic claws to unsheath, she at least gave the impression she did.  

Buffy and Faith were still.  They had paused while Buffy was on top, with Faith's curled plastic fist gripping her jaw, about to twist her neck, perhaps employ the popular AF ""pop your enemy's head off"" move.  They stayed that way, emitting tiny panting noises (though their chests are unable to heave), looking at each other intensely.  The others were dead silent.  Finally Faith shoved off, got up, and offered her hand to help Buffy to her feet.

<b>AF Faith:</b>  You're all right, B.
<b>AF Buffy:</b>  I'm more than all right. But... you're not bad yourself.

All the AFs soon returned to their places, with Faith near Buffy, facing another angle to extend the general watchfulness.  After the episode, however, I found the two of them tumbled down together, stiffly but unmistakably intertwined, and the others looking on.  Distraction tactic accomplished!  What a relief.  And I believe Faith and Buffy stayed that way for several weeks.  Time does move slower in Rustydale."

"event","RustyNiece struck again. She begged to hear some Buffy music, ""the one with the animals.  The one where they say 'bunnies' and 'demons.'"" Then she set to work, humming ""it must be bunnies"" while rearranging all the AFs in regimental lines, male and female.  Eventually she found a large (to the AFs) stuffed bunny and attacked them with it.  

It's going to take a long time for the side-effects of this ""spell"" to wear off.  Poor Anya.  It's all Giles can do to keep her from hyperventilating every hour on the hour.  Since she actually has no lungs, I figure she must have learned to hyperventilate from watching TV, though what shows, I don't know.  Finally, Cordy came up with the idea of starting a clothing botique and asking Anya to be the business manager.  They have no inventory, but I saw Military Xander take Oz and Faith aside and present the idea of a raid on RustyNiece's Barbie and Bratz accessories."

"event","After their semiannual RustyNiece encounter, the AFs were confused, as usual.  Oz felt more relaxed than a plastic person really should be, and Willow had the feeling she wanted to cuddle with Oz even more than usual, but she didn't understand why.  The other four AFladies had the impression they'd just left a huge argument about closet space and kitchen chores, though Bunny Anya was actually thinking more about rental increase and mortgage rates.  (AFFaith was winking suggestively at red pants Buffy, but that's nothing new.)  None of which made any sense, of course, since with the exception of Giles, the closest any of them can come to changing clothes is accessorizing with weapons; and they share my apartment, rent-free.  

They all muddled under these delusions for a few days until their next RN encounter.  Giles hadn't been much affected, but after RN watched ""Fear, Itself"" with the whole plastic group (Bunny Anya:  ""Oh, <i>that's</i> that small plastic man's name, Gachnar!""), Giles couldn't remember putting on his sombrero. Also, Oz couldn't get Willow to stop crying.  She kept sobbing something about finding her missing arm, an issue that hadn't really bothered her for at least a year.  Thinking that was odd and then putting two and two together, Giles hit upon the obvious explanation that they were all under a spell.  I encouraged that idea, but I didn't go into details about how Spellmistress RustyNiece had put Oz and Willow in bed together, set up Buffy, Faith, Cordy, and Anya as roommates, and taunted Willow with her detatched arm.  I did tell them I had a special potion for breaking the spell, but that it didn't smell very nice.  Thus, I was able to line them all up on newspaper and spray them down with Lysol, neutralizing whatever RN had been coughing and sneezing all over them all evening.  Turned out the spray tickled&#151and, FYI, AFGiles's giggle is just as infectious as Anthony Stewart Head's though considerably more high-pitched&#151and most of them liked the smell.  I think maybe the chemical odor reminded them subconsciously of their birthplace, the plastic vat in the toy factory."

"event","I cleaned off the desk in my room today, to prepare for thesis work.  It's not my old desk; I have that with me in the city.  It's an old rolltop that my mom had in her study when I was growing up.  I rearranged some of the framed photos and things she has decorating it, to make room for my action figures.  (Which I brought home for inspiration, of course.)  AFOz and AFWillow are arm in arm on his patch of plastic grass, up on the top shelf, facing the window.  Oz's arm helps hold Will steady, and they both enjoy the view of the woods to the west.  AFBuffy's standing guard nearby, on her own, looking permanently wary (or pissed, it's hard to tell; even RustyNiece commented, ""Why does her face look that way?""); likewise, AFFaith took up position down near the pencil holder.  AFGiles, who has been wearing his serape since cold weather came, and Bunny Anya, who is thrilled with winter because her fuzzy suit is sweltering when it's hot,  are side by side near the Swiss clock.  Anya likes the way it sounds.  ""Time is money!"" she occasionally chirps for no reason whatsoever.  Giles groans and searches for a tiny pair of glasses to clean before he realizes he never had any.  AFCordy and Military Xander are off by themselves in the dark corner of the desk, next to the wall.

In momentous finale news, AF Faith and Red Pants Buffy were liberated from their stasis bubbles just moments before the episode began.  Having spent several months staring at one another across the bookshelf, they wasted no time falling into one another's arms.  Faith, with her well-articulated ankles, fell a little more heavily than Buffy.  She made out with Buffy's neck for the entire hour.  Happily, this activity distracted the rest of the AFs from the goings-on of the actual episode.

"event","It's been a difficult week in Rustydale.  Sometimes I think I should preview the <i>Buffy</i> episodes before I let the Action Figures watch them.  But they get so excited, I'm sure if I shut them away they'd find a way out and sneak into viewing range, anyway.  Since I'm unspoiled, I can't anticipate disturbing scenes.  The poor AFs just have to be shocked and horrified along with me.

<lj-cut text=""The AFs react to 'Dirty Girls'"">AFGiles was fascinated with Caleb.  He kept musing about Flannery O'Connor and religious literature he wished he could get his hands on.  The rest, especially AFXander, were more interested in Faith.  

<b>AFCordy:</b>  Now that's a bitch I can get on board with. Attitude!  And did you see her pants?
<b>AFXander:</b>  H-h-h-h-uuh.  Yes.
<b>AFOz:</b>  Nice monosyllable, dude.
<b>AFWillow:</b>  Poor Dawnie.  Faith is going to take away even more of her Buffy time.
<b>AFGiles:</b>  Shush, you lot.  It's the Caleb chap again.
<b>Rusty:</b>  All of you.  Hush.  You know the rules.  Only talk during commercials or I stuff you under the sofa cushion.
<b>BunnyAnya:</b>  In hell?
<b>AFXander:</b>  Heh.
[AFCordy moves her four-point-articulated arm to smack Xander playfully on his plastic hair.  Since he normally leans on her for balance, AFXander falls backwards with a clatter.  Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico scampers over and pats his face with her paw.]

They tried to restrain their chatter, though there were some soft yelps during the fight scene near the end.  AFOz had always kind of liked Molly.  AFGiles kept moving his head back and forth (it's not really ""shaking"" when it makes a stiff, squeaking sound) and saying ""foolhardy.""

All that stopped when TVXander lost his eye.  People on the AICOB boards that night mentioned that Xander had screamed, but I hadn't realized it because of AFWillow's shriek.  

Have you ever heard a mouse scream?  Or a rabbit?  You think they're silent creatures, maybe a squeak here or there.  But when they're caught, when their bodies are pierced by teeth and crushed by jaws, they can scream.  It's shill and it makes your blood slow down.  It's what AFWillow sounded like.

AFOz tried to hold her up, but she was crying too hard and his arm, like all of their arms, is a bit stiff.  (I wonder if there's a lubricant for plastic joints.)  They spent the rest of the episode sitting together at the back of the end table, Oz's grey plastic shirt getting all shiny and wet from AFWillow's little plasticy tears.  AFXander kicked a weapon across the table and went to sit by himself behind Canadia the Stuffed Racoon and Hi-Bounce Dawn. AFGiles seemed preoccupied.

AFWillow spent the night huddled with Oz, after his unsuccessful attempt to distract her by playing songs on his guitar.  AFXander came back to the others acting all casual, and tried to crack some jokes.  In the morning, AFWillow scooted over to her friend.

""Xand, you wanna talk about it?""
""Talk about what?""
""Well, you know..."" her voice quavered.  ""The, um, eye.""
""Why would I want to talk about it?  It's just a stupid TV show.  Are you ready for your stakes practice?""
""What are you talking about?  Those are, like - I mean, we're made in their image!  How can you not care?  And - "" she lowered her voice, ""I'm afraid you might be a target.  You know how we had to protect Giles earlier this year.""
""Dammit, Will.  I am <i>not him</i>.  Look at my clothes!  Look how good I am with weapons!  <i>And I'm six inches tall</i>.""

Willow argued that just because thier Giles occasionally wears a sombrero doesn't mean there might not be copycat attempts on his life, and that a little camouflage paint wasn't going to keep AFXander safe.  Xander made a noise of disgust and clomped away to a corner.  Willow appealed to Giles and his sense of reason.  That was unfortunate, because Giles had somehow found my little green Gideon New Testament, and plunged into his memory for Oedipus Rex (He must have been busier than I thought, that day he visited my bookshelf in the study.)  He was so excited about his project that he started throwing quotes at poor Willow.  If his timing hadn't been so poor, his dramatic interpretation of Oedipus would have been a pleasure.
<blockquote>""Too long you looked on the ones you never should have seen, blind to the ones you longed to see, to know! Blind from this hour on! Blind in the darkness, blind!"" 

""What good were eyes to me? Nothing I could see could bring me joy.""</blockquote>

And with the Scripture,
<blockquote>""The eye is the lamp of the body.  If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.  But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.  If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!""

""And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out.  It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.  Everyone will be salted with fire.""</blockquote>
On a good day, AFWillow would have challenged Giles to explain how his literary finds had anything to do with TVXander.  Instead, her face crumpled impossibly.  ""You don't know what it's like to lose a part of your body!"" she wailed, scooped up Miss Kitty under her remaining arm, and in a truly foolhardy move, hopped from the end table to the couch arm, where she sat brooding for the rest of the day.  <lj user=""thebigfuzz""> came over once and sniffed noses with Miss Kitty. </lj-cut>

So, AFWillow and AFXander aren't speaking to each other, AFGiles is at a loss, and Bunny Anya thinks they're all idiots.  She's busy coming up with a plan to check under the couch cushions for loose change.  Sigh.  I hope next week is better."

"event","<lj-cut text=""AFXander and Hi-Bounce Dawn's big brush with a tiny abyss."">Though the action figures have a good view of the outdoors from their end table, they didn't notice the snow here on Tuesday.  They are always too nervous on Mondays and Tuesdays to notice much going on around them.  They use their various plastic sharp-edged weapons to sharpen toothpicks, they discuss theories among themselves, and when they can't do that anymore, they break off from the group and find other ways to pass the time without going nuts.  AFXander and AFCordy do equal amounts of sparring and making out.  AFOz plays music to distract AFWillow from her tendency to panicky speculation. (It appears I have something in common with AFWillow in that area.)  AFGiles reads.  He says he reads the pocket astronomy guide I keep on the table, but I suspect he also devours TVGuide.  In the name of research, of course.  Sometimes when I'm gone, I think they use my computer.

Wednesday, however, the new episode of Buffy over and their heads briefly clearer, they were more aware of their surroundings.  In the morning, Willow must have looked out the window, because she let out a sharp little scream.  She thought a colorless hell dimension was encroaching on the boundaries of the house.  Giles set her straight, and then she was then enthralled with the idea of snow.  Cordy didn't like that it was supposedly cold (she has a sleeveless shirt, after all) , but Xander was thinking James Bond and <i>A View to a Kill</i>, and actually proposed they all go out and train in the snow.  I don't think any of the others wanted to train, but they went along with it.

Knowing they wouldn't be able to get the patio door open no matter how smart they are and how much they work together, they asked me to take them outside.  Willow thought Hi-Bounce Dawn should come, too.  So I put Dawn, Willow and Oz, Cordy and Xander, and Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico out on the balcony for a romp.  Giles stayed in with his TVGuide.  Oz slipped on the ice once, but Willow helped him up.  Xander started rolling Dawn around.  He thinks she's getting soft and won't be ready for an attack, should one come.  Since he pretty much believes whatever Willow says, and she is a tad paranoid, he sees training as a responsibility he can't shirk.  Don't ask me how rolling around is going to help her in case of attack.  I would think he'd want her to practice bouncing.

In case any new readers are joining us, Hi-Bounce Dawn is a glowing green ball of rubber.  She comes up past Xander's knees, so when he rolls her it looks a lot like a kid playing with tire.   Unfortunately, she rolled into a four-inch deep crevasse.  Military Xander, not one to lose any of his ""men,"" especially during a training exercise, dove in after her.  He was able to push her out, and she wobbled to a stop just before knocking MCKF across the ice in the other direction.  But then Xander was stuck.  His knee joints don't bend far enough for him to get leverage and push himself out of the crevasse.   Cordy was worried and knelt to help him out.  She too kept slipping, millimeter by millimeter closer to the crevasse.

Observing, Oz was amused. 

<b>AFOz:</b>  Hey, guys.  Think about it.  They make sleds out of us.
<b>AFWillow:</b>  Plastic-us, not us-us!
<b>AFCordy:</b>  Just get down here and help me.  I'm not getting any warmer.

So Willow and Oz each anchored one of Cordy's feet to keep her from slipping into the crevasse on top of Xander.  He held her hands and scrambled, and was eventually extracted.  That was enough for them all.  They headed back to the patio door, pausing along the way to gather up Miss Kitty, who had been happily batting fallen birdseeds across the ice.  The knocked on the door, but I didn't hear the tiny sound until the Fuzz, who had mistaken them for birds, stalked them and accidentally ran his head into the window in ""pursuit.""</lj-cut>"

"event","The action figures accompanied me to a small BuffyCon in Dallas last weekend.  True to <lj user=""jennlynnster"">'s predictions, most of them emerged from their cozy travel bag complaining of strange bruises, sore points of articulation, and strained plastic.  They couldn't for the life of them figure out why.  Since they're still wary about AFGiles's safety, they think someone has done a spell to weaken them, rendering them less able to protect Sombrero Man in a fight.

A spell was involved, but the truth is, AFWillow herself did it, at my request.  As soon as I saw that the participants of the Let's Eat Cheesy Balls and Muffins Clinner were going to live up to their name, and were using action figures to enhance the experience, I had her perform a little mind-clouding and forgetting spell so the poor sweet things wouldn't remember things <a href=""http://www.imagestation.com/member/join_signin_prompt.html?album_id=4290868825&bnak=1&rf=album&ru=%2Falbum%2F%3Fid%3D4290868825%26bnak=1/"">such as these</a>.  It was similar to the spell cast by RustyNiece when AFXander and AFWillow were forced to marry and have two daughters named Blossom and Buttercup, but there were cedar sprigs and oblations of spiced wine involved this time.

AFGiles saw my mom's paperback copy of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and asked me about it, quite interested.  He thinks he must have had a prophetic dream about one of the characters.  Heh heh."

"event","The action figures are getting along well here at the farm, even after the introduction of AFCordelia.  I was a little concerned about how Willow would take it, no longer being the only female.  She had this world of men sort of revolving around her, or she may have felt that way at times.  And though she has a wonderful boyfriend in AFOz, she also had a close friendship with AFXander, who spent the first three days after Cordy's introduction, well, introducing himself to Cordy some more, if you know what I mean.  At least that's what his cocked eyebrow said later, the dork.  I happen to know that those clothes are not removeable.  They're like painted-on chastity belts.

Cordelia showed surprising wisdom and tact by introducing herself to Willow right away, complimenting her stake-grip, and asking when they could get together for girl talk.  She sympathized with Willow about the lost arm, and shared that she feels inept sometimes because of her horrible balance problem.  ""These boots may look stunning and expensive, and of course they are,"" she confided, ""but they are hell to stand up in.""

So all is well, potential cattiness didn't materialize.  And really, I think even if Cordy had turned out to be a complete vinyl bitca, Willow would have had other things on her mind.  <lj-cut text=""Spoilers for Buffy 7.8 and 7.10"">  Namely AFGiles.

She has kept the group faithful to their round-the-clock schedule of guarding Giles, brought on by their viewing of ""Sleeper.""  She also made Giles wear his serape at all times, and during the daytime he has to keep his sombrero on.  Even ""Bring on the Night"" did nothing to allay her fears that the forces who endangered TVGiles could very well be after every Giles made in his image.

If you remember AFOz's encounter with Nick Brendon last summer, you may recall that action figures have a complicated worship-type relationship with the actors and characters who inspired their creation.  They know that the stories on television are not literally true, or they say they do.  But they seem to know it in the way some religious people believe in their holy writings.  Literal or not, there is truth there.  Thus, Willow's freakage upon seeing TVGiles with an axe blade swinging toward his head. </lj-cut>

But AFWillow doesn't just worry.  She takes the ""action"" in ""action figure"" seriously.  On New Year's Eve, she led a quest to end all quests.  This was no ""journey"" from the television to the bookcase.  This was an effort to make the universe sit up and take notice.  And it all started in my childhood bedroom.

I learned later that the destination was a hollow in a live tree, where a protection ritual was to be performed for Giles.  This tree grows next to a spring in the lower pasture north of the house; the spring bubbles out of the ground, pours over tree roots, and winds through a pebbly creek bed until it flows into the pond.  There are lots of boulders and small water caves among the giant gum trees that grow in the hollow.  The only way AFWillow could have known about this is if a bird or one of the farmcats told her.  As it turned out, she had begun her plan Christmas Eve by sending Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico from the top of the rolltop desk down the string of Christmas lights to the windowsill by my bed.  There Miss Kitty was to watch for any passing feline she might befriend.  Lucky for her, I keep the window cracked a bit even in winter.

At the same time, Willow and Oz took turns on Gileswatch while Xander and Cordy scouted the bedroom for external exit points.  Despite her balance handicap, Cordy is quite up to the task with reconnaisance.  She and MilitaryXander are perfect for each other.  She even has a satchel full of weapons and supplies.  I think Xander nearly swooned when he found that out.  (He had better find a good way to thank me.)

So while Miss Kitty was talking grooming and geography with Inga the Tabby Huntress, Xander was climbing a bedruffle and a curtain to discover that there is no window screen or latch on my east-facing window.  Cordy picked up Miss Kitty on the way back, and they all regrouped on the rolltop around midnight.  Inga hopped up on the window ledge outside.  After a startling moment in which her purring sounded remarkably to the AFs like human speech, then became purring again, they behan to make their plans.

The quest began on New Year's Eve.  Willow said something about the waning moon and the eve of a new cycle.  It must have taken them ages just to get up to the other windowsill, with Willow needing help on all the climbing, and Miss Kitty lacking extendable claws to climb the curtain.  (Inga, watching their progress from the east window, noticed this and mewed with outrage at the manufacturing oversight.)  It took every one of the AFs heaving together, including Willow with one hand, to open the window far enough for them to get out.  

Then they all had to jump to the ground.  Giles and Xander were confident none of them would be hurt, given their construction of sturdy plastic.  But Willow reminded them of a certain toss from the hands of RustyNiece that resulted in the loss of a brittle arm.  Poor Willow, it was her plan and her quite understandable neuroses nearly stalled it.  But finally Inga stepped up and offered to carry Willow and Miss Kitty down from the window ledge.  This was also frightening, as it involved the cat's mouth closing over Willow's torso.  Miss Kitty vouched for the the Huntress, and Willow has a lot of faith in her pet.   It turned out okay.

From there they had a trip across a vast expanse of open pasture, through a blackberry bramble, and across a small marsh and the creek to reach the hollow tree.  To give you an idea of the distance, the house is on a hill on one side of the twenty acres, and the pond is in a hollow on the other side.  So basically, quite a few miles in AF distance.

"event","The history of AFMilitaryXander has been marked by turmoil in the area of romance. There have been no flukes with AFWillow, but there was the Oz crush, and the SlaveCordy rejection. No wonder the poor guy tries to compensate by writing conspiracy Post-Its to the government and posturing around Giles. It's enough to make his plastic head do a 360. (And that could have tragic results, even though the neck is supposed to be one of his points of articulation.)

Well, Christmas night was his night. I had brought AFCordelia from the Angel series home with me, safe on her card and in her stasis bubble, hidden in a tub of books. After everyone else was in bed, I took Xander in one hand and carried him to the Christmas tree with Stasis Cordy behind my back. There in the light of the colored twinklies, I presented them to each other. Xander couldn't speak.

He was agitated that it took me so long to free her from the bubble, though. He hopped a bit and then crawled up on my lap to try and help with the twist ties cruelly shackling Cordy's arms and legs. The climb took him so long that I was finished by the time he got there. He extended his hand and, the perfect gentleman, helped her step from the plastic casing. Well, that was what was supposed to happen. In reality it took him and me both, with Cordy cursing up a storm, to pry her from the plastic.

Once it was done, she sighed a deep plastic sigh of relief, made sure her hair was in place (not realizing yet that the only way her hair can be out of place is if her head comes off), and then kissed Xander on the cheek. I have a good feeling about this.

Xander came back over to me and motioned me down so he could whisper in my ear. They were going to spend the night under the tree, if that was okay, and could he please borrow the Barbie hairbrush RustyNiece left behind?

I don't think he gets the thing about molded plastic hair, either. It is a shame. AFCordy's hair is dark brown, long, wavy... gorgeous."

"event","I normally don't interfere, but I picked up Hi-Bounce Dawn off the floor and placed her next to the other Action Figures. She glowed briefly with thanks. Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico scampered over and greeted her with a tiny paw-pat, and she glowed again. Dawn is surprisingly expressive for a ball of rubber energy.

The AFs continued to watch new Buffy eps with me. They are all worked up over the events of Season Seven. AFWillow doesn't actually recognize her Season Seven TV counterpart as being the same character as her. I really think it's simpler that way, so I haven't enlightened her. I wasn't completely sure any of the others made the connection with the TV characters, either, until recently.

We got to the premiere airing of ""Sleepers,"" and like every other spoiler-free champion, I had no idea what was coming. If I had, I might have censored it for them. Willow's so tenderhearted, you know. When the axe bore down on Giles's beautiful pate, a lot of things happened at once. Willow screamed. AFXander and I yelled in unison, ""Giles, behind you!"" It was funny, and I went to punch his arm and say ""Jinx, poke, you owe me a smoke"" but I accidentally knocked him over. Willow had started sobbing immediately, and, it took almost five minutes for AFOz to calm her down enough to understand what she was babbling about. Xander was busy picking himself up and bending his legs joints back into the precarious standing position.

It turned out Willow was suddenly terrified for AFGiles. If her prophetic dream came true, then what if AFGiles was in danger? What if whatever threatened him in ""Sleeper"" was looking for all the Gilses? Willow now insists that Giles wear his sarape, on the chance that it would disguise him a bit, throw the dogs off the scent. She would prefer also he kept his sombrero on at all times, but that's where he draws the line. He says it's heavy and makes his neck ache. Thought I'm not sure how he manages to ache, being solid plastic.

All the AFs have now taken up weapons and are stationed at intervals around AFGiles. Giles holds his chainsaw and has his hidden knife at his feet. Xander keeps his trusty machine gun, Oz a crossbow, and Willow a good old trusty stake as well as her notebook, in which she has written out a schedule for a round-the-clock watch. MCKF sleeps near the cross/knife at Giles's feet with one eye open. Giles chuckles nervously and tries to say it's not worth getting so worked up about. He has no glasses to clean, and his wrinkles are painted on, but you can tell he's also thinking about how to save his genuine molded plastic ass."

"event","The morning after Giles and Xander returned from their research quest, there was a lot of bustle, kind of the way your house might have been when you were a kid and your family was getting ready for their summer vacation. As it turned out, that was almost what it was. Except I heard the word ""pilgrimage"" thrown around a lot. Weapons were packed up, clothing was checked for nicks and dents, AFWillow was running around dusting the top surface of the TV. Ma Joad-like, she just couldn't leave their old home dirty.

I was able to figure out that AFGiles interpreted Willow's dream phrase, ""From beneath you it crumbles"" to mean that literally, their home was not structurally sound. That cracked me up. I'm not sure why. I let them go about their business, because I was curious.

They were going to lower everybody down the powercords. First would be AFOz with Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico on his shoulder. AFXander was to follow with Willow tied to his back with Oz's guitar strap. (Willow couldn't hold on well enough with one arm.) Then Giles alone. But they ran into problems deciding how to get Dawn down.

Dawn, if you recall, is a glowing green hi-bounce ball about two inches in diameter. She doesn't say much. Or do much. But damned if they were going to abandon her. None of them could carry her, though. Finally they decided to just throw her down. She is a ball, after all. Willow didn't like that plan because she was afraid it was an affront to Dawn's dignity, but in the end they had no choice. Dawn didn't bounce on the carpet, just made a soft thud.

And so their trek started. The Big Fuzz came to investigate. Miss Kitty convinced him to take Dawn from Xander and Giles, who were laboriously rolling her while Oz and Willow carried most of the weapons. The Fuzz batted Dawn across the floor with his paws, dribbling her like a soccer ball.

At that point I had to go shopping. When I came back toting a DVD player from Best Buy, the AFs were in the process of scaling the arm of the couch. It appeared they were headed for the end table. I had to leave the room because I was laughing so hard. This was their big pilgrimage? Across the living room? I mean, yes, it takes them a couple of hours. But good grief, Oz has gone all the way into the kitchen before! 

Action Figures are such drama queens.

I set about installing the DVD player while the AFs were discussing how to get Hi-Bounce Dawn up to the table. I already had two VCRs on the bottom shelf of the TV table. When I put the DVD player on the bottom and replaced the two VCRs on top of it, the shelf began to sag. ""Creeeeeeak,"" it said. ""Grooooan.""

Holy hell, I thought. Dreams ARE prophecies! At least Willow's are!

"event","The day after hearing about AFWillow's strange dreams, AFGiles announced he was going on a research quest. AFWillow's eyes widened as much as their plastic sockets would allow, and she looked up with great interest. Research! But Giles looked meaningfully at AFXander, and Xander caught on fast. (Sometimes he's a little less dense than Cordy made him.) ""Oh, but Will,"" Xander said, ""you need some practice on your crossbow reloading. Better stay here."" AFOz didn't need any prompting. He hooked his left arm around Willow's waist (his right arm won't bend that way) and said, ""Sweetie, I want you to hear my new song tonight, too. Stay?"" It was quite sweet, how in tune those three are about protecting Willow from her nightmares. She agreed to stay on the TV with Oz, but insisted that Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico and Xander accompany Giles. Miss Kitty would make sure all was cool with the Big Fuzz, and Xander would help him scale the bookcase.

I don't know what Giles hoped to find in my books. I've got children's lit, some nature field guides, old literature and art textbooks, Chinese dictionaries, a bunch of classics... who knows. I still don't. Giles, Xander, and Miss Kitty returned from their quest exhausted from hiking to the study and climbing up and down the TV table and bookcase. Miss Kitty curled up at Willow's feet and fell asleep right away. Despite his weariness, Xander took Willow aside and drilled her in one-handed crossbow reloading. While she was busy, Giles had a whispered conference with Oz. They both looked very serious."

AFGiles integrated with the group much more successfully than SlaveCordy. The only potential snag was when AFXander saw the chainsaw Giles brought with him and felt his status as the weapons and fighting guy a little threatened. He was a little more straightforward on this point than he'd been with Cordelia. He sat on the table ledge, struck up a conversation, and proceeded to quiz Giles hard on all points of military weapons maintenance, physical training, and military logistics. Giles did poorly enough on questions about machine guns and tank driving that Xander was satisfied, and from there they were able to have an productive conversation about the merits of various new and old fighting techniques. 

Eventually the subject of AFWillow came up. Giles asked about how she lost her arm, and they got to talking about how she is coping really well. Xander mentioned her recent dreams. Giles was intrigued. I think I even saw the painted furrows of his brow furrow a little more. ""Crumbles..."" I heard him muttering to himself. ""From beneath you..."""

"event","After the high of watching the season premiere, things deteriorated for AFXander pretty quickly. I moved all the AFs back to their place on the television, but with five of them it was getting crowded. Xander tried to talk to SlaveCordy, but he was terribly nervous. He gibbered something, she thought he was making fun of her rags, and she said some pretty sharp words to him, as SlaveCordy is wont to do. Her mouth doesn't have the tendency to stay closed, as is common with most other beings made of molded plastic. For a buff military man, AFXander is surprisingly sensitive.

He had a talk with AFWillow about it. It was awkward for him, because he doesn't know that Willow knows he also still has a bit of a crush on AFOz. It was awkward for her, because she wants to encourage his interest in someone besides her laconic, plastic boyfriend, but she doesn't think much of SlaveCordy and doesn't want Xander to get hurt. She ended up asking him to train her to use a crossbow with a stake for backup. I know she'd been having trouble figuring how to make the transition with one hand, but she really just thought being useful and needed would make him feel better. I think that was wise of her.

Xander was briefly distracted by setting up a training regimen for Willow. But it soon became clear that Cordy's presence was becoming too much for him to handle. She kept making comments about his clothing (the irony was lost on no one but Xander, who was simply crushed to note it) and then ignoring him. She doesn't seem like a happy AF. Either that, or she has a funny way of flirting. Willow had a little talk with me when everyone else was asleep, and we decided to send Cordy back to her Office home. Cordy creates a stir wherever she goes, it seems. OfficeDale updates on their way."

"event","Last time we saw the action figures, AFWillow had started having vague but disturbing dreams about something falling apart. AFMilitaryXander wanted to train more.  Whatever it was, he figured extra emergency and weapons training couldn't hurt.  AFOz decided hypnosis was the key to seeing if Willow could remember anything more specific from the dreams.  He suspended an extra stake to the cat's string and used it to put Will in a trance.  By the end of the session she was crying and whimpering, ""From under you it crumbles... crumbles...""  Oz held her.  Miss Kitty licked her hand.  They all wondered what crumbles.   <lj-cut text=""Three become five.  Hummus is served.  TVWillow inspires."">

That threat was put on hold, however, in late September, when two big, related events occured:  the Buffy Season Seven premiere, and the arrival of AFFiestaGiles and AFSlaveCordy.

The original three were so excited about the premiere they didn't sleep the week before.  It was going to be their first regular-season episode.  Willow was obsessed with designing a contraption to increase the television's rabbit ears reception, and Xander was helping build it, while Oz drafted recipes for Premiere Night refreshments, including some great-sounding hummus.

All the plans screeched to a halt Tuesday morning.  I'd brought Giles and Cordy home from Officedale the night before, so they could watch the premiere, and kept them in their comfy transport bag because I didn't want to freak the others out too much.  Remember, I'm afraid of them getting attached to Giles if he's just going to leave again.  And there was the whole attraction/confusion possibility with Xander.  One minute he's secretly crushing on Oz, the next minute there's this firey rag-clad woman making him go ""Oooh.""  Poor guy.

Tuesday morning I bit the bullet and lined all five of them up on the top of the couch, facing the television.  The newcomers caused a ripple of surprise.  Willow felt instantly drawn to the tall older man in the sarape.  Somthing in his face told her they'd have plenty to talk about.  She sidled over to him while Xander was gulping nervously and trying to figure out something cool to say to Cordy.  He'd helped her escape from her packaging once, on a long car trip, so he had that going for him.  Oz observed.  I think he was really still thinking about how he was going to get up to the kitchen counter to prepare his hummus.

He must have done some fancy work climbing the dishtowel up to the sink, because when I rushed in that night, there were snacks waiting for me, and all the AFs were back on the couch.  They can really do some amazing feats when they're motivated.  I don't know how the introductions went that day, but everyone seemed to be getting along by the time we watched ""Lessons"" together.  They were so cute.  Like during this scene:

<blockquote><b>TVWillow:</b>  I wanna be Willow. 
<b>TVGiles:</b> You are. In the end, we are all who we are -- no matter now much we may appear to have changed.
<b>AFWillow:</b>  *sniffle* [<i>thinking, perhaps, about her own recent amputation, slips her hand into AFGiles's</i>]</blockquote></lj-cut>

"event","Back home in Rustydale, AFWillow, AFXander, and AFOz had worked out their alliance with the Big Fuzz. 

You recall that they were concerned about the constant threat of the vacuum cleaner, and Oz realized that the cat also considered the VC his mortal enemy. Against Willow's tender wishes, they had determined that Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico should be the one to attempt to open communication. Xander was to climb down the television power cord holding her in one arm.

The time came, and Willow wasn't coping very well. She was quiet, not saying much, but she had tears welling up in her little eyes when she kissed MCKF and hugged Xander as if she would never see him again. As Xander disappeared over the side of the TV, she was trembling. (Her sneakers made quite a clatter on the television top.) Oz put his arms around her as much as they would bend, and they watched the descent. MilitaryXander's quite the stud with physical feats. His plastic hands don't even slip against the plastic power cord.

They reached the floor safely, but the Big Fuzz was nowhere in sight. This was fortunate, because Willow had spotted a piece of string - one of the cat's toys, actually - and was yelling down at Xander to tie the string around his waist and throw the other end up to Oz. He did. Pretty amazing arm he's got.

Miss Kitty sat primly, looking around while Xander fiddled with the string. But it turned out the Fuzz was stalking them. He was sneaking up from the study, and no sooner had Xander turned around from throwing up the string then he heard a warning shiek from Willow and then felt himself batted across the floor into the baseboard. He has a very solid head, but he was knocked out. Willow was sobbing and trying to pull him up by the string, Oz was calmly helping her, and the cat was delicately sniffing his prone figure.

Then Miss Kitty scampered up, right between the cat's nose and Xander's body. She arched her tiny back and let out the littlest hiss ever. (Nobody actually heard her except the Fuzz and possibly Oz, who claims he has some wolf hearing.)

This must have really intrigued the Fuzz. He sat back on his haunches, incredibly ignoring the figure of Xander attached to the string, scooting across the carpet toward the TV table. He just regarded the tiny hissing creature.

And that was it. He was quite taken with the spunky kitten. He's Lou Grant to Miss Kitty's Mary Richards. MCKF had a good talk with him, apparently. She couldn't explain all the concepts, but she got the Fuzz to agree to meet with AFOz, no paws, teeth, or crossbows allowed.

Willow tenderly held Xander's head in her lap until he recovered. It would have looked sweeter if his body wasn't so stiff that it basically formed a ramp between where his feet touched the ground and his head lay in her lap. Once MCKF had been pulled up to the TV top, the four of them conferenced. Willow was still concerned. She asked if the Big Fuzz was really safe. ""Safe?"" Miss Kitty said, ""Of course he's not safe! But he's good.""

So the summit meeting took place. The Fuzz and the action figures have mutual warning systems in place for VC threat. The Fuzz agreed not to hunt the AFs if they would use their weapons to his benefit, securing him the occasional moth or junebug. They can't come on his hunts, but Miss Kitty can visit with him as much as she wants. I think I heard them whispering about how the Fuzz would distract me while Willow snuck in and disabled the VC's motor.

All this was very fortunate too, because soon after the alliance was forged, Willow started complaining of bad dreams. It was at the beginning of autumn, as the leaves outside were starting to fall. She would wake up whimpering and trying to grasp something with her missing arm. (It was quite pitiful. I was crying through my giggles.) She told Oz something important was falling apart. She thought they needed to move from the television, but she didn't know why.

"event","I haven't written an update since before the Buffy premiere, and there has been a lot happening, as usual in Rustydale. 

The biggest thing that happened is I brought FiestaGiles and SlaveCordy home from Officedale for the premiere party.  I'd been trying to keep them separate from Willow, Xander, and Oz because I feared the original three would be too shaken up.  With Giles, I just didn't want them getting attached because he was going to leave again, but with Cordy - well, there'd already been enough drama with Willow and her arm, and I wasn't ready for more so soon.

On the other hand, for one thing, I was getting the feeling that R2D2 was a little obsessed with Cordy.  He completely abandoned Tiny Leia and started fawning over the new girl.  SlaveCordy was originally holding her shovel and bucket, but I came in one morning and found the shovel broken, on the desk below their shelf.  I could only guess that R2 had pitched it over the side.  And the bucket was nowhere to be found.  It was weeks later that I discovered it in R2's internal cavity.  The little bastard was hiding it from me!

So I figured R2 and Cordy could use some distance. Then there was my guilt over keeping Giles and Cordelia locked in a small windowless room with very few visitors and no entertainment.  It won out.  I wrapped up the two, put them carefully in my bag, and carried them home.  

But do you think Cordy appreciated that I tried to be gentle?  Nope.  Whine, whine, bitch, bitch, ""you obviously have no appreciation for the hours it takes me to get ready in the morning, you big oaf.""  Um, excuse me, small one?  Your hair is literally plastic.  Your clothes and make-up are permanently painted on.  And those rags - well, okay, the rags were actually more crumpled and sad-looking when Cordy came out of the bag.  I didn't admit that to her though.

"event","I had been thinking Slave Cordy looked pretty handsome holding her bucket.  That jaunty smile and her saucily crooked arm completely offset her unfortunate wardrobe.  I told her so, and she clenched her teeth and kept smiling.  I don't think she has figured out how to move her face yet.  [Aside:  I wonder if people who get Botox treatments have a secret, psychotic desire to be action figures?]

But I went to the office this evening and Cordy's bucket was missing.  I looked all over the shelf, behind the computer below, on the floor in case she had somehow pried apart her fingers and flung it.  No dice.  Finally, on a hunch, I checked R2D2's internal compartment.  Yup.  There was the bucket.  The little bastard has teamed up with Cordy!  He's her minion or something!  He just whistled and beeped innocently when I questioned him about it.

I haven't been spending much time in the office (bad rusty) so I'm not sure what's up with Princess Leia still cowering between Giles's legs, clutching her little blaster.  Perhaps she knows something the others don't.  I would think she would have shared with Giles by now.  But then, they may be having some communication problems.  I should work out some sort of key for Dark Side/Hellmouth translation.  They're just from different cultures, these gangs.  Since there's no Willow in Rusty Officedale, maybe Tiny Leia could give Giles pointers about using the computer.  She couldn't use it herself, of course, as she's only slightly larger than the Enter key, and her molded white robes would make hopping from key to key difficult.

Giles did have a couple of requests.  First, that he be allowed to remove his sombrero and poncho sometimes.  He said his neck and shoulders were getting stiff.  I refrained from making the glaringly obvious observation there.  It's true, the plastic poncho and solid sombrero weigh almost as much as he does.  Cordy asked if she could wear the poncho.  The air conditioners run in the office 24/7, and she gets chilled.  Those rags are so thin.  Funny, though, wearing the collar and rags must be mellowing her a bit, because the Cordy I expected would freeze to death before she would wear an oversized, brown plastic blanket with a hole in it for the head.  

Giles's second request was that I let him put down the chainsaw and instead leave some books on the shelf for him.  I wish I had <i>Stuart Little</i> or one of my literature anthologies there, but the only book I could find that wasn't a grammar workbook from the 1970s was <i>Welcome to the U.S.A.</i>  It has instructions on how to use the phone systems, where public toilets are located, travelling by car and the like.  He seemed grateful even for that.  I fear he hasn't been enjoying his quality time with Cordelia.  And while Tiny Leia hasn't made a peep and the Beanie koala just slouches, AFBlossom is very chipper, and she keeps calling him Professor G and begging him to play with her.  I can see it on his ruggedly handsome face.  ""I didn't sign up for this.""

Before I left, I helped Giles put down the chainsaw.  It had taken some serious, slightly painful maneuvering to get his poor fingers to hold it in the first place.  While this was going on, I noticed Tiny Leia's almost imperceptible eyes get almost imperceptibly wider and her miniscule hands clutch the blaster tighter.  Huh.  I wonder what she's so afraid of..."

"event","AFOz is forging an alliance between The Big Fuzz and action figurekind. 

He realized they had a common enemy: the vacuum cleaner. The VC (predictably, the acronym was first used by MilitaryXander) is the only thing the Fuzz, my huge cat, is truly afraid of. (He's suspicious of my electric shaver, too, possibly because it appears to be the offspring of the VC, but he knows he can beat the shaver up.) When I roll out the vacuum cleaner, the Fuzz arches his back, hisses, and runs to the other room, where he observes from a safe distance, trying to act all casual. But it seems like the vacuum cleaner follows him around. He hates it. When I have it laid out on the floor, vulnerable, changing the bag, the Fuzz creeps up with his ears flat against his head and swats it with a cautious paw.

Oz has plenty going on under that helmet of spiky plastic hair, and he observed all this. 

He formulated a plan that involved using Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico as a liason between them and the Fuzz. In this plan, MCKF would approach the larger cat, acting her most feline and babyish, and the cat would recognize her as a kitten and not prey. Then talks could begin about the vacuum cleaner. 

Of course, the biggest gamble was assuming the Fuzz would actually recognize MCKF. Would he really know she was a kitten, and would he feel like taking care of her? After Oz's proposal, Miss Kitty, who is the size of my first thumb joint, scrunched up her face and put an adorable paw over her eyes. Willow saw that and nearly melted down (metaphorically, of course, not in a left-too-close-to-the-stove way) thinking of putting her pet in danger so. Oz held her head and kissed her to calm her down, then carried Miss Kitty to the other side of the TV for a private talk. I think he feels like he has a special connection with animals. This amuses me, since AFOz is not a wolf. But of course he really identifies with the Oz he sees when I watch seasons 3 and 4. When they were through talking, Miss Kitty went and rubbed her head on Willow's legs and purred a bit, then scampered over and sat expectantly by the power cord.

From there they had several options: 1) Lower MCKF down on the power cord alone. 2) Let her go down with Xander, who is the strongest and can climb while holding her in one arm. (I was attracted to this option at first, because anything that keeps AFXander useful and busy keeps him from descending into his dark Snuggles Conspiracy place.) 3) Send her down perched on Oz's shoulder, which, since her ceramic claws will not extend, is almost as risky as sending her down alone. 

Xander felt that he should take her down, but AFWillow, ever protective of her loved ones, did the resolve face she learned from real Willow. She pointed out that the Fuzz has already had a taste of Xander and might decide to finish it. Willow wondered why they couldn't all go. Strength in numbers and all that. However, both Oz and Xander are tender and protective of Will and refused to let her into the fray. I was looking closely and I saw her tiny face darken and her hand clench more tightly around her little stake. How much you want to bet she's going to beat Xander the next time they play Training?

Although Miss Kitty is ready now, I'm not sure when they are planning to stage First Contact. (It's not really a one of those, but AFXander, while not fluent in Klingon like his TV counterpart, has seen a few episodes of Star Trek and thought it would make a cool mission name.) More on that as events unfold."

"event","Taking action figures out of the box is rewarding - the little sighs when they emerge from their plastic stasis bubbles, the chafing of small arms and ankles recently freed from their twisty-wire shackles, the first attempts to remain standing on those ungainly legs. It's like watching a nature video of animals being born, only, you know, freaky and featuring much more plastic. But of the good, no placenta.

A few days ago, I received FiestaGiles in the mail. He'd been lost for a long time. I figured out why when I discovered the misplaced customs slip on the parcel: it was for somebody's care package to Kosovo. I'm sure Giles would have found a postal adventure in the Balkans stimulating, but I'm relieved to have him here. 

After debating the wisdom of exposing Giles to the others before he's whisked away to my office, I went ahead and opened his package. I'd waited til AFWillow, AFXander, and AFOz were asleep in their spot on the TV. I didn't want them getting attached to Giles when he would just have to leave. Sigh. 

For eveyone's peace, I'd been keeping Cordy in stasis back in her box. I let her out too. I was delighted to find that Giles's poncho comes off, and while his sombrero is molded to fit his head perfectly, Cordelia can also wear it. Giles looks very handsome in his grey vest and tie, and he knows it, but he's surprisingly good natured about the poncho as well. Maybe he's humbled by the dark-brown wrinkle lines painted on his handsome face.

After letting Giles hold his chainsaw for a bit and coaxing Cordy to stand on her ridiculously (but character-appropriate) high-heeled boots, I sequestered them both with their accessories in a Ziplock bag, inside my backpack. As you can imagine, Cordy was NOT happy. I had to put the bag in another room so she didn't wake Xander and start the whole rescue business over.

At the office, I accidentally broke Cordy's shovel trying to push it into her curled fingers. She was not upset at all. She still gets to hold her cute bucket though. She's currently trying to convince Giles that buckets are tons more useful than chainsaws, so he'll trade with her. As if. 

The other office toys were instantly attracted to AFGiles. No surprise. Who isn't? Blossom the Powerpuff Girl flew around his head and played with the sombrero a bit before returning to her Beanie Baby partner on the other side of the shelf. That beanbag koala is pretty dumpy, so I'm impressed with Blossom's loyalty. The one-and-a-half-inch Princess Leia, however, has completely abandoned R2D2 and is standing in the shelter of Giles's legs. She has a half-centimeter of headroom there. Giles is such a good patriarch. His new gang may have different talents than the Scoobies, but I think he's fond of them. He lets them wear his sombrero and tutors them in their various disciplines while I'm in class."

"event","AF Xander, AF Oz, AF Willow, Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico, and Slave Cordelia got to hang out on the dresser in my childhood bedroom all last weekend. As far as I know, things were pretty peaceful until RustyNiece came over. 

To the four-year-old Niece, AFs are Barbie dolls with all their clothes painted on. (Barbies are modest these days; they have painted underwear.) RustyNiece quickly spied the AFs and put them under her thrall. She re-paired Xander and Willow (who were married and had two daughters last time she visited). I don't mind that, really. Then she made Oz and Cordy hook up, and of course they had to make out vigorously to seal the marriage. That was wierder. Finally, when RustyNiece noticed SlaveCordy's rags, Willow came to the rescue. Touching.

Willow: [in RN falsetto] I'll save you!
Cordy: Oh, thank you!
[Willow pulls the bucket from Cordelia's hand and throws it to the ground]
Willow: There you go!
Cordy: Thank you!

Neither of them are very clever under RN's thrall. 

When it was all over and the thrall wore off, each of the action figures shook the confusion from its head (if its head was moveable) and brushed off its clothes (if could bend enough to reach its own clothes). Oz felt like he should be traumatized but he didn't know why. But nobody lost a limb or even a hand this time, so I declared it a good afternoon."

"event","One day a couple of weeks ago, I caught AFXander just sitting, affectionately holding AFOz's guitar. I am positive that he neither knows how to play nor has any ambition to learn. 

Me: Action Figure Xander, whatcha doin'?
AFX: Um, oh, Oz asked me to hold his guitar. You know, 'cause I have experience guarding stuff.
Me: From your time in the military, right. 
[I try not to chuckle.] 
AFX: He's with Willow. I'm just keeping it safe til he comes back. 
[He sighs a tiny plastic sigh.] 
Me: Xand, Oz is having a pretty good time with Willow. I bet he's not too worried about his guitar.
AFX: No, you know, just in case anything would happen. He loves his guitar. 

Poor Xander. I didn't know plastic features could look so long and sad. I didn't tell him that Oz and AFWillow were actually sitting on the other edge of the TV, watching the sunset together out the patio window, with Oz rubbing Willow's shoulders. (Having to wear a backpack 24/7 makes her a bit sore.)

With this kind of drama among just three action figures, I didn't intend to get any more. Well, okay, I'm working on a Ganya pair to establish Rusty Officedale, but they're to be completely separate. However, last weekend before my trip home to the farm, I stopped at my comic store, and there was Slave Cordelia on the merchandise table, looking very forlorn and small among the various big nasty monster action figures. Spiderman hadn't even made friends. I rescued her. It was the only decent thing to do.

I intended to keep AFSlaveCordelia completely separate from the other AFs - maybe let her be Giles' companion in the office until Bunny Anya finds her way to me. During the three-hour drive from city to farm, Willow, Oz, and Xander were tucked safely in my MBTV canvas bag on the passenger seat. But of course Cordy had to complain loudly and incessantly from her box beside the bag, and Xander overheard. He's all conflicted now. 

When he heard her talking, he struggled to the top of the tote bag. I almost wrecked the car trying not to laugh as I watched his little shape moving inside the bag like a cartoon mouse under a rug. But when he stuck his head out, I could see the misery on his face, which, as I said, is surprisingly expressive...

[omnicient narrator] On one hand, nearby there was a beautiful slave woman trapped in a box. On the other hand, if he rescued her and made friends, Oz might see him paying attention to her and think his affections lay elsewhere. Not that he'd declared his love for Oz or anything... dammit. He felt like writing ""luv sux"" in the glove compartment door with a spray of bullets.[/omnicient narrator]

Eventually his military training, or just his noble heart, must have overcome the misery over Oz, because Xander got to work. He climbed completely out of the bag and dropped down onto the passenger's seat where the Toy Fare box was. Even his many points of articulation didn't make the task of freeing Cordy easy. He eventually set his jaw, took a deep breath, and enlisted Oz's help. I thought that was very classy of him. Oz held the bottom of the box while Xander gripped the inner cardboard liner with his poor permanently-curled fingers and pulled. Willow couldn't grip the box with only one hand, but she was curious enough to stand on the tote bag and ""supervise.""

There was an animated segment on Sesame Street years ago that always sent my brother and me into fits of giggles. Still does, in fact. A rabbit was trying to pull an enormous root vegetable from the ground (carrot, radish, I don't remember) by tugging on its leafy top. Every time he gave a mighty heave, he made a high-pitched sound like, ""eeeeeiYOY!"" Xander may be all tough soldier boy, but I swear on my Buffy board game he made this noise when he pulled SlaveCordelia's plastic, form-fitting cradle from her box.

She never stopped talking once during the whole ordeal. Once I saw Oz look at Willow and raise a painted eyebrow in comment. Willow stifled a giggle. She did seem concerned about Cordy though. She even helped Xander by steadying the molded form while he struggled with the cruel wire twist-ties binding Cordy's arms and legs to the form. When she was free, Cordy gratefully threw her arms as far around Xander as they would bend. (I don't think she has realized yet that one of her forearms is longer than the other.) Xander took Cordy's hand and helped her climb into the tote bag with him. They were pretty quiet after that. How did Xander make her shut up? What did they do in there for the rest of the trip? Paint each other's nails? 

I couldn't ask Willow or Oz to spy for me; they requested to be put on the dash so they could watch the scenery. It was a revelation to them. Have you ever seen a kid looking out the window during her first trip in an airplane? It was like that. Oz gripped the air conditioning vent under the windshield with one hand (the road was quite curvy) and put his other arm around Willow to steady her. willow used her arm to point, gasping with delight every time we passed a broad ditch full of wild daisies and yellow butterflies."

A few minutes later, I noticed them conferencing over by the other arm of the couch. The had their heads together and were speaking in more whispery voices than usual. It looked like AFXander was leading the meeting. Well, truthfully, it looked like AFWillow was letting Xander think he was running the meeting. I won't tell if you don't.

This morning they announced to me that they've formed a new crack squad for the protection of the spoiler-free public against the dangerous incursion of Buffy spoilers. They say a manifesto is forthcoming, but I'm not sure they'll follow through; it seems a little implausible. They did perform their theme filk for me though. Oz provided guitar accompaniment while Xander and Willow sang. AFXander really can't sing. AFWillow has a sweet little voice though.

Also: I have no idea how my AFs know about a 1980s cartoon. Maybe MilitaryXander is into some vintage hero-worship. And quite possibly delusions of grandeur.

"event","It's been fairly quiet in Rustydale recently. Well, as far as I know. I've been gone a lot. Yesterday when I came home, the action figures were all sitting on the couch waiting for me. They're so sweet. Oz and Xander sat beside me and Willow and Miss Kitty climbed in my lap, and we watched the Teen Choice Awards together. They all about fainted every time AH or SG were on screen. I gave them each a macaroni out of my bowl of mac'n'cheese, and they munched happily away. 

It must have taken them a couple of hours to get to the couch from the top of the television: down the antennae cord, the hike across the living room (stopping often for Miss Kitty to frolic in the carpet fibers), and scaling the side of the couch, AFWillow clinging tightly to AFXander's back with her arm, and AFOz balancing Miss Kitty on his shoulder. I'm sure they never could have made it up if I hadn't left the box fan there. Xander mentioned having had to employ some covert movements among the vertical blinds to avoid attracting the attention of The Big Fuzz. 

That's what they call my cat, who is indeed large and fuzzy. I didn't anticipate any problems between him and the AFs, but a week ago there was an incident. Call it an earthquake, act of God, bump of the vacuum cleaner, whatever - it resulted in all three AFs plummeting to the floor. Willow landed face-up and seemed winded but okay. Oz's fall was broken by his flexible wrist joints (interchangeable hands are good for so many things) and the stake he happened to be holding. But poor Xander. Face down, bruised by landing on his gun, he proved to be irresistable to my cat. He was swatted by an inquisitive paw. Willow screamed and tried to crawl toward him, but she hadn't quite caught her ""breath,"" and anyway, crawling is hard with only one arm. Xander's boot was gripped by monstrous fangs and he was dragged about twelve inches (that's like twelve feet to you or me) before Oz managed to sit up and throw his stake. He hit the beast on its snow-white chin, causing it to drop Xander in surprise. At that point I'd seen what was happening, and I swooped in and gathered the AFs up to safety. 

All was well - no carpet burn or permanent damage to Xander, and he got lots of cooing and attention from Willow, who cried a bit with relief. For his heroics, Oz got a big, grateful, admiring hug. Just from Willow. But I could tell Xander wanted to. To tell you the truth, I think AFXander may have a bit of a crush on AFOz."

"event","AFXander has still been acting strange. He found a small silver medallion on a short chain, and he's been wearing it around his neck. Like a dogtag or a protective amulet, he says, but it's not working for me. It's inscribed ""THE sak."" Maybe THE sak is a patron deity of plastic soldiers? 

Xander's also been a bit listless. I can tell he wants to ask AFOz to play Training; it's Xander's favorite thing in the world to do. But Oz has been in his own itty bitty world lately, practicing guitar and gazing at AFWillow. So Xander mopes around, cleaning the weapons, muttering to himself about Snuggles and his evil plans. It's clearly not healthy. I don't know why he doesn't ask Willow to play Training. She's been practicing kicking and staking, and she's getting quite good, even compensating for the balance problem presented by the lack of a left arm. Perhaps MilitaryXander is a bit old-fashioned in his view of gender and warlike activities.

I thought they all might like a change of scenery, so I moved them to the bedroom dresser for awhile. Tonight I came in and found them all sleeping in a happy heap on a folded blaket. Xander was in the middle with Miss Ceramic Kitty Fantastico in the crook of his arm, Oz on his left, and Willow on his right. I gently took stake, machine gun, and guitar from their immobile hands and laid the accessories aside. The little guys look so sweet when they're sleeping. They never even get bedhead."

"event","In Rustydale, all the AFs have been pestering me to read more of Jessica's X-Files recaps. I don't know how they heard about those, but I get the feeling my action figures are a little miffed because they're convinced X-Files AFs have more fun. They may also be under the mistaken impression that I only value them for their ability to distract me from spoilery places on the interet. I'll have to let them throw a little party or something. I don't have anything like the Livin' Large expansion pack, but bet I could make itty bitty cookies. If I have to buy their affection, so be it.

Yesterday AFXander asked me for some stamps, envelopes, and the little pencil that came with my ballot when I voted absentee. Curious to know where this was headed, I handed them over and obligingly moved Xander and his items to the kitchen table. When I got home from work 9 hours later, he had just finished addressing the envelopes and was in the middle of putting on the last stamp. He had gotten his hand stuck between the stamp and the paper. I freed him, stood him up on the table, looked him directly in his close-set eyes and asked what was going on. He is obviously trained not to buckle under questioning, because he was all Soldier Guy and brusque and said it was ""classified."" There are many ways to threaten and torture action figures, but I'm tenderhearted and won't use any of them. Anyway, I know AFXander is saliva-impaired; he still needed me to lick the envelopes. As I licked, I noted that they were addressed to the POTUS, the joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the FBI, the publisher of UFO magazine, and Joss Whedon. They felt like they contained... nothing. I couldn't peek inside because AFXander was watching me like a hawk.

I went to Willow. She perked, ""I'm sworn to secrecy. I'm mum. I'm a mum chum."" Sigh. Fortunately, my wee friends are careless. On the floor behind the TV, I found a Post-It note that contained what was obviously a draft of the letter. I located a magnifying glass and read,

<blockquote><i>Dear ______________,
You may not know this because the dryer sheet company is a cover meant to brainwash the public. But the teddy bear Snuggles is a deadly mutant who wants to kill everyone. If he is not stopped, someday soon he will easily sneak into people's homes and plant his mutant spawn in the laundry baskets of the nation. You have the power and respect to do something about it. Please believe this and act immediately.</i></blockquote>

I'm afraid the X-files stuff, the military training, and the hours of Hellmouth field time clocked are merging into the creation of this cockamamie conspiracy theory. Everybody knows Snuggles isn't a mutant. He's a demon. No bear could be that manaically cute and squeaky-voiced without hiding a set of razor teeth and a regurgitating poison mucus problem. Hmmm. Maybe I should mail those ""letters"" anyway."

"event","AFXander and AFOz were both alarmed by AFWillow's magical arm-reattachment talk, prompted by her exposure to Lindsey and his evil hand. Well, I assume Oz was alarmed. He might have raised an eyebrow. Xander started pacing and then spent awhile absentmindedly cleaning his little gun. (That is not a euphemism.) A little later, while Oz was off practicing guitar, Xander approached Willow and cleared his throat.

AFX: So, how ya doin', Will?
AFW: Fine. Don't I seem fine? I'm fine!
AFX: Um, yeah. So, how's life with one arm treatin' ya?
AFW: What?!
AFX: Must be kind of hard, you know, typing, ah, painting your nails... and as far as we know you don't even have toes to use for extra dexterity. What's inside those sneakers anyway?
AFW: Xander, what are you doing?
AFX: I bet you miss it. The arm. You know, I'd be furious at RustyNiece if I were you. It's her fault for throwing you. Or maybe Rusty. She could glue it back on if she wanted. Although it would be kinda stiff. Er.

This went on for a bit, with Xander goading and Willow insisting she was fine, until finally, just as master strategist MilitaryXander planned, she yelled at him and started to cry.

AFW: (softly, sniffling) Look at me, Xander. I wasn't even a good action figure when I had two arms. You and Oz are normally proportioned and you can bend all over. But my stupid legs are way too long, my torso is weird and small, and my nose looks funny. Even ice cream couldn't improve this nose. (sniffling harder, distractedly stroking Miss Kitty with her sneakered foot) I have a measley eight points of articulation - okay, seven now - I can never take off this backpack, which, by the way, is the backpack of a dork - 

At this point Xander interrupted her insecurity fest with his secret weapon: the ""You're My Hero"" speech. Since you already heard a version of it in The Freshman, and the ""You're Perfect Just the Way You Are"" variations were way predictable, I won't go through the whole thing. Despite its repeat use, the speech was quite sincere and it did the trick. Xander used his superior points of articulation to give Willow a comforting hug. 

Willow gave up the magical reattachment scheme, decided she's worth something after all (since Xander was so sure about it), and we had a nice burial ceremony for the arm. Xander used a spoon to dig a hole next to my potted rosemary bush, and Oz was the speaker. It was a short, literate service. 

""There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Goodbye, arm.""

I'm giving AFWillow a little of extra TLC tonight by letting her spend the night on my bedstand. Also, I think Oz is writing her a song. He is so sweet. He doesn't realize that his guitar doesn't actually work."

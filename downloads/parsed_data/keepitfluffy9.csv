"event","MCR was really worth this kind of hangover thing I have now. They were excellent! Definatly different to all the other bands I have seen before. There was fire and Gerard came in on a hospital bed...but there was no zeplins, which was unhappy. I saw Ellen there, she was with her cousin I think, well, she was with a small child anyway. They were playing slapsies, but with out any goals, so basiclly there were just hitting each other. Ellen said she had a headache today in school, but I had a full scale riot in my brain, my ears were buzzing and I needed to got to the toilet every ten minutes. I have no idea why, I didn't eat or drink anything dodgy, I just had some coke-a-cola. Oh yeah, I also bought a pack of overpriced badges for a fiver. That was fun! Ellen and I swapped stories of drunks and junkies today. She had a drunk couple in front of her, swilling a bottle of red wine, and I had this druggy guy who was crying down his phone, shouting 'THEY'RE ON! THEY'RE FINALLY ON!"". He also had swimming dance moves.&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""CLICK!"">Maybe I'm just a fucking saddo, but as soon as I saw Ellen, I wish I had gone with her instead. Mainly because Bethan was complaining about needing a wee, but...still. It was so much better though when she stopped complaining and went to the loo, but i still missed Ellen.&nbsp;Life is sad.<br /><br />I think Mum is pissed with me. This might be because when I got in late last night I was behaving like a twat, and I begged her for a day off today. Now, she sent me to school, saying that I was only tierd and I didn't need to stay home for that, then I came home around 2nd lesson, because I was terrible. I think she thinks I am faking it or something.&nbsp;I did try though.&nbsp;I held out as long as I could in school, until I just thought 'Oh stuff it! Mum will get over it.' and let Mrs Shaw send me home. Mind you, I didn't even have to ask for a sick pass. In first lesson, Mr Evans (Mr I-wouldn't-want-my-man-to-smell-like-that!) asked me if I was ok, because according to Kimberly, I looked like I had a hangover. Then Mrs Shaw, saw me in second lesson. As soon as she noticed me, she offered me the pass, but I said no, because I wanted to see if I could cope all day. After I had run to the toilet again, I gave in.&nbsp;<br />NOT MY FAULT!!!<br /><br />I like colouring in. A lot. especially with felt tip.<br /><br />Goodbye friends.<br /><br /></div>"

"event","We went to a french/spanish open day today. It was very good and I learnt lots and lots...but I also had to endure Kate playing 'Chasing Cars' on her mobile on constent repeat. Then she went all sobby because the song made her think of this boy she fancies...which meant everyone went a little silent because we were thinking of ways to cheer her up (all of which failed miserably). My iPod had no battery left so I was stuck in that snow patrol induced misery world next to a moaning Kate. All wrist slashing worthy, I can tell you.
So on Saturday (maybe Sunday...I always get them two mixed up!). I am going with Bethan to MCR concert. I was kind of under the impression that it would be me, her and her cousin. Oh no, how wrong was I! Theres a huge crowd of us going....Seriously....masssive!!!! I think there's me, Bethan, her cousin, Bexy, Jade, Louisa 1, Louisa 2, her cousin's friends (maximum of 5), Jade's cousin, ect ect. Eep!
I have got back into the sims 2 now...BIG TIME!!! I've got the new seasons expansion pack and its increadible! Much better than even I expected! The snow effect is wonderful, it looks almost real and I was truely freaked out by the thunder .Poor little Alex K Sim (happy b'day by the way real alex....), he got burnt to death by a tree that caught fire after it was hit by lightning. Luckily, my sim was there and I told the grim reaper off and he's okay again now!!!!! WOOO!!!!!
I like music magazines that smell distinctive...
I cheating on the sims morally wrong????&nbsp;
Also, big dissapointment. The kaiser t-shirt I bought in the concert is too tight if I wear my super padded bra.....cry cry cry!&nbsp; Normally, its fine, but I can't look super nice in it now. Waa....
Going to Greece in May. I am simply dreading wearing a swimming costume, I hate it. And I always look sweaty and pink in the photos.&nbsp;I wish we weren't going, or we were going somewhere cold instead (*cough*Sweden*cough*)&nbsp;

ROXY MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(bryanferryscaresme)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(butilovehimanyway)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How do you use send space to send stuff and shizz?"

"event","I suck. I really do. I am coughing like a horny old sailor and sweating like a duck at christmas. S-U-C-K. I've been ill for ages now, and this&nbsp;is the first day I can actually look at the PC for a while.&nbsp;Plus, I am the best i have been&nbsp;in the week, but my mother says that if I am like this tommorrow, I can't go to see Kaisers because I lack pizzaz. PIZZAZ????!!!!! Just being in the same country as Kaisers will give me all the fucking PIZZAZ&nbsp;I need!!!!!!! Pizzaz my arse....

So, I&nbsp;have gotten back into CSI again and the Mighty Boosh.&nbsp;Not at the same time, obviously, coz that would be weird. It would be like 'So who killed Amanda? THE SHARK WITH KNEES!'&nbsp;Quite cool actually.&nbsp;

One of my friends pushed a letter through my door today telling me to get better. they also included a&nbsp;gift of cheese and chive sauce. SWEET!!

I have pizzaz? Dont I?

I&nbsp;have lost 4 pounds in as many days, and keeps on dropping.&nbsp;yuchy. wheres it all going, is what i want to know? I&nbsp;bet its just in snot alone.&nbsp;Maybe thats where I carry weight, in my nose. Now, all I have to do is sneeze of 2 stone and I will be as happy as a little pie.

Gareth wasn't amused by my Kaisers joke. He did that face like he's remembering my name so when he gets famous, he can slag me off to the NME. I later shouted that i&nbsp;was sorry, but&nbsp;Alice said he ran into the bathroom, with something shiny on his face. She thinks they were tears. Bet he was faking it...

Oh yeah, I am&nbsp;starting ricky and the giant pea up again. It...well, it made me smile and&nbsp;some of you seemed to enjoys some of it, so what the hell.&nbsp;Any slump&nbsp;in quality is&nbsp;totally my fault.

I found out my cat is epileptic.&nbsp;We&nbsp;were on my bed watching&nbsp;Enjoyment when&nbsp;some footage of&nbsp;one concert came up with flashing lights. She went really weird and fell on the floor, all shaking. She's ok now though, we&nbsp;got some medication. Its dead sad, she actually seemed to like Kaiser's DVD.&nbsp;

God, I love the science department!&nbsp; First Miss Carpenter knows one of the automatic, and now Gareth (who is this science person who wanders around wearing a white coat looking like he's ment to be there) is in a band! They're not that bad actually, it will need more listens though. They are called We Are Trees and the drummer, Gareth Barnes is the one that works in my school. I haven't actually heared him speak yet, just walk around looking important, with his hands in his pockets. One of my mates said he smiled at me, as I had my hands in my pockets too, and he probebly thought 'Oh there is another freak who likes keeping their hands in the warm'.&nbsp;<br />So anyway, check them out. They don't appear to have been signed yet either (yeah, if they were signed, why the hell would he be working in a girls school?)<br />I am strangly excited about all this. I'm thinking of running up to him and going 'OMG! Your the drummer from We Are Trees! Can I have your autograph?' and I will just forget to tell him that I only know because Miss Carpenter told me. Nothing ever happens round here, so thats why I am excited. Also, they performed in the glee club in cardiff, which is where my cousin had his (short lived) comedy career.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am bored and going to hospital with my grandfather and mam. Just a check up.&nbsp;<br />I might actually pick up my guitar today! SHOCK!!! HORROR!!! or maybe I'll just tinkle on my keyboard as usual.<br /><br />Beep....beeep....neep....i can't think of anything else to say........<br />My mam got me jamie t's&nbsp;album. I am warming to him like a piece of hot toast.&nbsp;<br />BYE!</p>"

I didn't even realize that it was a special say until my mam gave me some pretty fairy lights! I got so bored that I actually told the lovely people at heidiseeker.com to write this really soppy thing with my order of funky gloves. Its really stupid and kinda sad&nbsp;considering&nbsp;I wrote it myself on the PC (in about 5 minutes) and got some poor sod to write it out for me.&nbsp;It goes like this<br /><br /><font color=""#ff00ff""><em>Dear Grace<br /></em></font><font color=""#ff00ff""><em>I am sorry i can't say this to your face, I guess my self confindence ends there. I love you and I need you. Everytime I lok at you I think of how much I want you to be everything in my life<br /></em></font><font color=""#ff00ff""><em>Be my girlfriend, be my wife. Be the mother of my children.<br />Be my valentine?<br /></em></font><em><font color=""#ff00ff"">Alex xx<br /></font><font color=""#ff00ff"">P.S Will you marry me?<br /></font></em><br />The people actually covered my order in little stick on hearts with I love you written on them! I feel quite ashamed in case they actually thought it was real.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today was boring too. Me, Ellen, Kim and Alice were just sitting around talking about Jesus.&nbsp; Oh yeah and I accidently flashed at Jess. we were getting changed after PE and I began to take of my bra, cause I forgot where I was. I am so stupid *bangs head on desk hard! *<br />I hate my Art teacher he's a little fuck. I prefer the student teacher because at least he talks to you nice.&nbsp;<br />We also done this thing in school, a GCSE subject dry run. We had to pick some subjects that we were interested in, but not the final ones. Just some ideas. Because I picked triple science I can only do three other subjects. I picked Law, History and Religious Studies as my priorities and Drama for my reserve.&nbsp;<br />Ah fuck it all. I am going to bed to eat Tobelorone!<br /><br />(i was kind of hoping that Chive would text today, but I guess he's shacked up with new pair of scottish tights. Wanker :(&nbsp; And i thought he was a nice boy...)</p>"

"event","So yes...today!<br /><br /><strong><u>The GOOD STUFF!<br /></u></strong>My ultra funky cats eyes glasses came today from Heidi Seeker! I look really cool (well, in my level of cool. To normal people I probebly look like a twat). It came with a gorgeous metallic case to keep them in with little squiggy cherries and ice creams on. I might wear them tomorrow to school with a big long scarf and a black coat, and I'll hang out with the drama students so I look like I belong SOMEWHERE<br />Micheal Newman is in the boys choir who my choir is mingling with. YESSS!!! He's hot and he wants to take over the world with me. He wears a rainbow scarf and waltzes around wearing his Captain Jack Harkness coat. I can't help but fancy him. Its just....YUM! He's my mates drum tutor though and he's 17, so I guess I haven't got a chance in hell. A girl can dream though...<br />erm...was there anymore good stuff?<br /><br /><br /><br />No, I didn't think so.<br /><br /><strong><u>The BAD STUFF!<br /></u></strong>Ellen wasn't in. boo!<br />Anna has told EVERYONE in my tutor group that I've met a 27 year old guy on the internet and I'm going to meet up with him. She is&nbsp;such a cow,&nbsp;I can't believe she spread rumours about me. What have I done? She fucking treats me like shit sometimes. Back when I was 12 she stole my diary and told everyone really personal things from it. She even threatened to put it on the computer and send it to all our boy mates. I was so upset, as I had confessed to fancying on of our boy mates in my diary. But I forgave her once she had apologised and gave it back. I'm so fucking stupid. I thought she would have grown up, but obviously not. She made me sound like a slapper and made people like Tara (not one of my big friends, but she is in my class) think its true and worry about me.&nbsp;<br />Anna has a heart problem, so I feel guilty about being pissed with her now. I really want her to get better though. Her heart keeps getting this massive adreniline rush and starts to go real fast. I hope that its nothing too serious and I really want everything to be ok between us. She&nbsp;is a good friend when she&nbsp;isn't being a bitch.&nbsp;<br /><br />Isobel was on top form today though. She's funky!<br />It wasn't THAT bad a day though...it was ok.<br /><br />I'm just a melodramatic whore I suppose.&nbsp;<br />I nearly threw up this morning cause I had pineapple and tea for brekkie. BURGH!<br /><br />"

I souldn't really feel sad, I mean, they have been friends for ages, way before I met any of them. I am just some new gal who just has a crush on her.&nbsp; <br />yeah I do have a crush on her. First public mention of this I know, but it took me a lot longer to come to terms with it than I thought it would. There you go then... <br />It doesn't feel like this in slash is all I can tell you.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, anyway. I am officially not-as-skint-as-I-was-before. I have an extra fiver. Its going to 50pbadges.com (where I got my super cute Alex button picture at the top!squee!).&nbsp;<br /><br />I was tagged!!!<br /><em>Once tagged by this entry, you list ten movies: your Five Favorites &amp; your Five Guilty Pleasures.

It was awful! they totally ignored my pleas of 'I'm an ALTO! YOU CAN'T PICK ON ME!!!!!!!' I was standing there looking like a nunce. Ellen came in and laughed at me, before smacking me on the arm and looking smug. Cow.<br /><br /><br /><br />SHIT!!!! <br /><br />I've got to learn my fucking welsh for wednesday!!!! <br /><br />SHAG SHAGGEDY FUCK FUCK!!!!!!!"

"event","<p>Well, it was parent's evening today. I was feeling a little nervous, but ok. I shouldn't have worried. My teachers ever since Year One have never ever had anything bad to say about me. Its quite boring to be honest with you. I mean, this term, I though I'd been 'naughtier' than before, but apparently not. Even in maths (which i am shit at!) I was getting the best marks in the class. It sucks. I can't do this rebelious thing at all. And all my teachers actually like me and all of them want me to do a GCSE in their subjects! Even Mrs Rees-Peak, our evil bitchy music teacher, she gave me an A for our composing task and said she hoped that I at least considered higher level Music. I am, but if its against RE, which I really want to do long course in, then it hasn't got a chance. I do like music, I just think i can learn in different ways rather than sitting in class. Design and Technology is also going, I've decieded. Its a nice lesson and everything, and I enjoy it, but i have so much else to do and its not the thing I want to do most in the world. I think I am going to do triple science aswell, but the only lessons I am sure about is long course Re and Art.&nbsp;<br />Today was kind of subdued. i guess some people were worried about the teachers meeting their parents. Anna has changed her tune about the GBS Club. She now wants to be part of it, and has designed t-shirts with me. They are really cool. What we are going to do is get nice, plain black t-shirts and put in quite big white letters on the front 'The GBS Club' and on the back rainbow letters spelling out 'coz some boys just wanna experiment'. We have also created rank patches that go on your shoulders. I am a gold patch as I am Kaiser Lexy (nickname).</p><p>I might try and write my first ever bit of Franz fiction. I've never had alex and the gang in a story before, its just been the Kaiser whores. Oh yeah, did you see the Kaisers in Q magazine? 4 stars outta 5 for their album, not bad pussycats! Ricky's looking older, but wiser too. Still love him.&nbsp;I also have Nicks nose, because I got these weird dents above the nostrils.</p><p>I love all of my friends at the moment, which is unusual. Usually, i'm pissed with at least one of them. <br /><br /><br />Got this from <font color=""#0000cc""><strong>darknessmatinee</strong>'s </font>page and it looked fun.

My trumpet was having hot gay trumpet sex under my table in English. Mine and Jess' trumpets (Ricky and Terry) are in love. We are kinda hoping they adopt so we can have cornet babies and sell them on Ebay. We were mucking about and banging the table and making sex noises, (as you do) when Kate asked us to stop as the vibrations made her feel funny. Strange.&nbsp;
We are going to get our GCSE selection sheets soon! WAAA! I have a rough idea of what I want to do. I'm thinking of Law, Art, History, Long course RE (call me insane, but I like it) and triple sciences. I really hope that they are not in conflicting places. If I have to choose a language, I want to do German but we ain't got a German department. I have to do french or spanish.&nbsp;
If you were magic, what member of Franz Ferdinand would you be?
I'd be the one the other ones all secretly fancied. Bob.&nbsp;

I would be very hapsiful to hear from some of you. Tell me whats going on.

I didn't even get any e-mails of my school mates. They must really hate me. Or just listen to me when I tell them my internet is off for ages. Merry Christmas *blub* .<br />So, we got messed aroung by BT (BIG TIME!!!) We don't even get our broadband from them, but we still managed to spend more time on the phone getting chewed up arse shit from then than we did actually getting the internet from Tiscali (who were actually very efficiant). We had to ring up BT four times to ask them to clear out line of TAGs (don't ask me what they are...) and the last time they said they had actually done it the day before we last phoned. Plus, when we were trying to get some infomation out of them, the staff were rude and acted as though we were just stupid costumers who could be treated like scum! I can't help but think that in places like Sweden, where the consumer services are supposed to be second to none, they must get treated better than this. Or is this what the world considers polite, and am I just the stupid, insane one?<br />During my time away from the internet I have bought the new Beatles album, fallen down stairs, lost my RE book, sang in the senior choir for the first time on stage, said good bye to my favourite teacher and...did a lot of other things as well. I also have the coolest bookcase in the world! It has these things that you can remove from the door, decorate however you want, then slip it back in! Mine is beautiful, it has a zebra flavoured background with Alex Kapranos, seahorses and other great things like a Smiths spewing iPod! Mieow!<br />I am going now. Bye<br />Grace</p>"

"event","Yay! I have broken through writer's block! I have now completed the next chapter of Ricky and the Giant Pea, its sadder than the other chapters and it gives you a good look into Ricky's past, before all this craziness began.&nbsp;I might post it on the weekend, trusting that I will be able to keep it to myself for all that time!

ANNA BARKER! IF YOU ARE READING THIS, THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS CAN ALL BE FOUND ON THE 9TH OF OCTOBER!&nbsp;

Sorry, just a messege for a friend.

I am happy now, but I might not be happy if my art teacher asks where my homework is and I tell him that I was away, and then he says I should have found out off someone and then gives me a detention. Then I'll be sad."

"event","<p><font face=""Times New Roman"" size=""3"">I keep on having this dream where I am this reporter (I think, but it doesn't really feature me much) and I am doing what I believe to be a documentary about modern day rock stars and their kids. The first one, who I always seem be filming and the only one I can remember really clearly, is Nick Hodgson and he's always pushing one of those double pushchairs with two twin baby boys in it. He talks about his relationship with his girlfriend before the pregnancy and how they really loved each other, then he goes on to say how he didn't believe that being a dad would be so much fun. After a while of him talking (he gets really teary at the end, its sweet) we move on to Ricky who seems to be having problems with his teenage daughter. Ricky is a single dad (I think as he mentions her going to see her mum on Sundays) and he's very upset because&nbsp;he used to feel so close to his daughter, but now he feels like they are drifting apart and&nbsp;as though she no longer loves him. Thats really sad too, so overall its a quite depressing dream.&nbsp;<br /><br />My mum has been admitted to hospital.&nbsp;</font></p>"

He was saying how people could be gettting off to our pictures on our blogs and stuff (luckily, I dont do pictures). He also told us a story about a girl who took two of her friends to meet up with this guy who she thought was 14 who she had met online. However, when they got there he turned out to be 40, but then she left her friends and went off with him!!! How stupid is that? Anyway, luckily the friends seemed to have a little sense and they told her dad what she had done, and he went off to find her. She had had sex with the older man, but was unhurt.

Ricky thought he knew all he needed to know about the giant pea. It was a big pea! What was there left to discover about it? Although, saying that, it must be a pretty darn special vegtable to have so much mystery surrounding it...<br />Ricky was so busy pondering the existance of the giant pea, he didn't notice how far he had got into the cave. It was pitch black when he realised. He felt quite scared then.<br />Suddenly he saw a light right next to him and a hand on his shoulder.<br />""WHO THE FUCK IS THAT!!!!"" Ricky screamed petrified, trying to run for it, but the hand holding him where he was.<br />""Calm down you dunce! Your the one in MY cave so really I should be asking you that question...""&nbsp;<br />The light was turned up to reaveal the face of a rather lovely looking young man. The light bounced of his sparkly blonde hair and his deep chocoltae eyes.<br />""Anyway, my name is Beck and I live in this cave.""<br />'He must be a right knob if he lives in a cave.' thought Ricky 'Oh well, maybe he can help me out.'<br />But before Ricky could ask him, he was shoved down to his knees and something long, hard, smooth and damp was shoved in his mouth.&nbsp;<br />""Sit down and eat this banana, sorry its a bit wet. I think it rained on it once.' said Beck , before starting to make tea.<br />Ricky was grateful for the banana, as he was getting rather peckish, so he munched it all up. As Beck turned up the light even more, Ricky caught sight of a whole mound of fruit. Melons, grapes, lemons, even kiwis were there.<br />""Don't suppose you have any apples, do you Beck?""<br />""Why the fuck would I have apples in a frgging CAVE, for fucks sake! You must be a right cock&nbsp; to think I'd have an apple in this fucking CAVE!""<br />Ricky thought that he didn't need to be so rude, but he didn't like to say so because Beck had a really long pointy stick in his trouser pocket which he was rather scared of.<br />Ricky then started to cry. He had just realised that he had been scared shitless for a long time and, OH MY GOD! He couldn't believe it! He had never ever been so far away from home!<br />Beck sighed, rolling his eyes slightly, ""Whats wrong now? You come in here! Eat my lovely fruit, then you get all emo on my ass!""<br />""I wanna go home!"" Ricky sobbed ""I wanna be in my bed and watch CSI and wank, and just be a normal man, instead of going on this crazy adventure! I had a life in Happy Land!""<br />""Not much of one, is what I've heard. News travels quickly around here.""<br />Beck got a piece of paper out of his pocket, unfolding it&nbsp;and holding to up for Ricky to read. It said RICKY WILSON IS A TWAT AND HAS NO FRIENDS. This made Ricky cry even more.<br />Beck may have felt a little sorry for our hero then. He was a ginger nut after all.&nbsp;<br />""Come on then. I'll get you outta here.""<br />He grabbed Ricky by the hand.<br />""Now hold on tightly or you'll get lost!""<br />And he began to lead him out of the cave.<br /><br />It didn't take that long to get to the cave enterence . It was a still night and Ricky could hear the crickets sing in the near by woods.<br />""Thank you"" he began before turning around to see Beck hiding in a corner.&nbsp;<br />He seemed in pain and was screaming very loudly<br />""RUN!"" he howled, ""RUN AS FAST AS YOUR GINGER LEGS WILL CARRY YOU!!""<br />""Why, whats up?"" said ricky, rushing over to help, because in girl guides he was told never to leave a friend in danger.<br />Beck seemed a lot different from before. He was now wearing&nbsp;a funk y hat and in his hands he had two turntables and a microphone.&nbsp;He turned to face Ricky,<br />""I should have told you sooner!""<br />""Told me what?""<br />""I AM A WERE-BECK! BY DAY, I AM JUST A HARMLESS BLOKE, BUT BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON...I BECOME THE VICIOUS, FUNK-A-DELIC KING OF HIP MUSIC!!""<br />Ricky started to run then, because in girl guides he was told to fuck off when something big and scary was comeing.<br /><br />P.S I had a complaint from someone in school saying I wish gingerist. I am not gingerist, i love little gingers. I love Ricky too, he's a babe. I just wanted to clear that up with you all...<br /></div>"

"event","I feel bad today. I had my ears pierced on Saturday and they are really sore now, and I over exerted myself during PE in school so I had to be sent home. I feel all faint and acheing and just basicly yuck... 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I cant think of anything else to write.&nbsp; 
Erm, here's a lovely story that I'm just going to make up off the top of my head. 

Ricky Wilson and The Giant Pea 

Once upon a time there was a lovely young man named Ricky Wilson who lived all on his own in Happy Land, where everyone turned their condoms inside out to save money. He was quite short when one&nbsp;thinks about it, and he was also ginger which meant that all the other men in Happy Land teased him because they were shallow bitches who do up their skinny jeans to tight. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day Ricky went on a long walk into the deep dark woods and suddenly, he came across a tall, handsome young man doing something to a tree. 
""Hello tall, dark stranger."" Said Ricky, ""What do you happen to be doing?"" 
""I am trying to milk this tree so I can buy a house for me and my 322000 kids to live in,"" Said the man ""Money is very tight in our house. They all want iPods for Christmas too."" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ricky felt very sorry for the man, as he knew that children were a pain. He saw one in the zoo once, it was dead scary!&nbsp; 
""Whats your name young man, who seems so very frisky?"" 
Suddenly, the wood turned bright and sunny and the young man gave off a tremenous glow, almost like an angel of the lord. The man seemed to grow in height, until he was almost as tall as the mighty oak, before booming in a great loud voice, ""MY NAME IS RYAN JARMAN, KEEPER OF THE GIANT PEA!!!"" 
""Thats nice, I'm Ricky and I work in Tescos."" 

To be continued...but probebly not. Blah.
P.S If anyone has any pictures of Gay Boys doing science, please send them to me! I can't stop thinking about the Gay Boy Science fair stall."

Kate is helping me because, left to my own devices, I would just write about stuff not many people were interested in, so she's doing the more 'popular' side. Hope I can do posters. But maybe a full sized naked Ricky Wilson pull-out wouldn't be to everyone's tastes...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my first careers lesson today. We had to write down our ideas of jobs we wanted to do, then rated them out of 1. Strong Possibility 2. Possible 3. Unsure. I think I put down Psychologist, Lawyer, Sitcom Writer, Rock Star (I know, not much of a possiblity), forensic scientist and journalist. It was a good lesson. Alice had to explain why she wanted to be a Pathologist.
""Well, I want to be a pathologist because I want to see their brains and stuff.""&nbsp;
Niice...
Isobel said she wanted to be Prime Minister or a Lawyer.&nbsp;
""I would like to be a lawyer as I really like knowing about other people's life.""&nbsp;
Don't we just know it?&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't wait for Friday now. Its the only day I ever do anything interesting and gets me to meet new and exciting&nbsp;people. Orchestra is a god send.

WOOO! I spent the rest of my b'day money in Cardiff yesterday so I guess its offically over. I had a Franz Ferdinand guitar tab book which looks ace so I am going to work through that, learning each of the songs. I also spend&nbsp;22 pounds&nbsp;on&nbsp;two pieces of make up.&nbsp;I am bad.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm so excited about Beck's new album!!! Its out the 2nd of October&nbsp;I think and it sounds smashing.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;been pushing Beck for a few days now, and have been horrified by the number of people who asked me who the heck Beck was. Shame on you monkey bums, shame on YOU!!&nbsp;I&nbsp;haven't heard his 'Cellphone's Dead' single yet, but I hope I will. I might go on iTunes now and look for it...&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so glad that Richard Hammond is getting better after his horrible accident. I was really worried about him. Everyone seems to think he's a lovely bloke and a terrific presenter. If he did die then I think I'd have to go into moarning. His&nbsp;poor wife must have&nbsp;been worried sick...<br />Anyway, I&nbsp;have now run out of things to&nbsp;say. Its funny that you think you could talk for ages then can&nbsp;only write one or two things, isn't it?

She made me watch her on webcam for about half an hour and she practically abused people like me on her blog. I saw her in school today, she's way shorter than me! She looks like she could slice me up mind so I'm still terrified.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My b'day today. I got I Hate My Self And Want To Die which is about the most depressing songs ever, a lovely note pad, a gorgeous photo frame and some other brilliant stuff. I also got the nicest chocolates in the world from hotel chocolat. They are beautiful! Hand piped with superb praline and gianduja. Dribble....
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a Flaming Lips song called Do You Realise?? and it's only today that I realised it was the most beautiful thing in the world. I knew it was smashing before, but now I know that its the only thing that never fails to make me cry (apart from chopping onions). The lyrics are so beautiful and it sounds so moarnful yet unfailingly hopeful. And some of the lines such as ' Do you realise that everyone you know some day will die?' is just perfect and it makes you think 'Yeah, I guess they will.' In other words, I love it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can now say I have more money than sense. I am going to spend all my gift money on shoes (these sparkly bumper boots covered in sequins!!!! SQUEE!) and make up (over priced eyeshadow!). Hooray!"

We got to miss maths for assembly (which is alright), my mum feels a lot better after her operation, but I met Chive today and we made up after an arguement we had yestersday, so that got a bit teary. It was a stupid arguement really, but it still stings a little as it was our first row.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mate Hanne and I have invented a club called the Gay Boy Science club. At the moment its a club anyone can join (anyone reading this, you can join by friending me. You will recieve...nothing much, just some love and attention), but one day we are going to turn it into a kind of Brainiac tv programme. We already have some special features of the show, such as Homo-dracula (to see if you can really puncture a person's neck) and Prof. Rick and Nick, who always seem to be in a 'intimate' position when you ask them to comment on something. Emma says we have issues!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now going to downlaod as many songs from iTunes I can. I am feeling miserable, so this is my retail therepy.<br /><br />I am England, I am pregnant with Serbia's baby which we are going to call Wales. Sweden is coming to our wedding.</p>"

Secondly, I found out that I am in senior choir (I'm an alto, huzzah.) and it made me feel quite bad for the people who didn't get through. I also had some wanker tell everyone that I was pregnant just because I was reading a poster about the Timeline of a Pregnancy. As for today, I had my first ever spanish lesson, had a really annoying spot on my nose, looked up rude words in my massive dictionary (hee hee hee, willies!) and kissed Chive some more, untill my lips were a bit sore and he had digested so much fruity lipgloss, he felt quite sick.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm very happy about me and Chive. I really, seriously, like him. He's...different to other boys. Perfect, in other words.</p>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Don't touch this link!"">I realized today that I look a right twat in my glasses. For those of you who don't know me ( which I guess is none of you seeing as NONE OF YOU MISERABLE PEOPLE ARE COMMENTING! God I wish I could make this a friends only, comment to be added journal, so I could go around feeling all popular and hip inside...) I have shoulder length blonde hair with a fringe over one eye and a kind of oval face. I wouldn't discribe myself as bad looking, just not very special either. now, just think of that, with square thick rimmed glasses that make me look like I am a fucking knob who goes around talking about how jazz was brillo and how latin lessons should be brought back in schools. Its horrible.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></div>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, yesterday I met up with Chive in Caerphilly, and we had a brilliant time! He's quite mental though, he has no sense of embaressment. I didn't think I did, until he started faking an orgasam on the park bench. That was pretty disturbing. Some old ladies started staring at us then, but he didn't stop. He's great though, definately could be one of my mates (or maybe something more?). He even bought me ice-cream! Brillo-pads!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I always talking about school in my blog? Looking back through my last few enteries it seems like I'm one of those teenage work-a-holics who can only think about school work and how much it matters. In reality, I'm not. In fact, I can think of several different things that is more important to me. I just think that, as achedemic stuff takes up most of my time, it becomes the biggest thing in my life, without me even realising it! Its bollocks and I hate it. I'd much rather spend all my time with friends, or learning to play the guitar, but instead I have to go to school and learn a language I don't even like ( Welsh ).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I am just doing this link to see the screen go grey"">Am eating a yoghurt with chocolate balls in! YUM!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow, I have to audition for senior choir. I have to sing a song of my choice in front of all the music teachers and I'm petrified! I have chosen Girl Afraid by the Smiths, but I am STILL not sure if I can sing it well enough, or even if I should be in senior choir. Everyone in there now is super talented and they even have to do solos! I don't think I'm cut out for that.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chive and I are going to meet up again soon. I think he likes me, I'm just not sure. I like him I know that much at least. He's very different in a good way.<br /><br />Bye then.<br /></div>"

"event","<p>God, I haven't posted for ages! Maybe its because no body is commenting or reading my page at all. Oh well, I'm as bored as hell so I might as well continue.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started back at school this week on Wednesday and it feels funny to actually have kids look up to you and think you know best. When I was in Year 8, that didn't happen because I was still kind of a little fish in a big pond, but now I'm Year 9, it seems easier. Can't wait until I'm in Year 10, you get to wear a shirt and tie! I got some new teachers (we no longer have Mr Dodge or Mrs Davies which is tres miserable) and I've been moved down in Maths (because I am crap at it and never get any questions right). The Maths teacher I have now is very good, but people say he had an affair with a sixth former. I don't know weather this is just a rumour or not.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met a brilliant guy in my cousins party. He was the son of one of my cousins friends, and as we were the only ' young' people there, we hung out quite a lot. His name was, please don't laugh, Chive Domino, and he might have had the sexiest male hair cut in the whole of the world. If you think of Nick Hodgson's cut, only a bit more choppy, with a fringe over one eye and purple streaks in it then you have the idea. He was fantastic. I texted him 2 days ago to see if he wanted to meet up sometime and he said yes. I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""More adventures..."">I just went to orchestra for the first time after the summer holidays. It wasn't too bad , considering I had left my trumpet in school for the whole 6 weeks. Me and Jess have been promoted to first trumpet, which means if we cock up, we all cock up. I was quite happy having it easy on second to be honest with you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got an early birthday present. My real b'day is in 12 days, but my mum got me&nbsp;a Fender Strat electric guitar recently. It's gorgeous, all red and sparkly, so I named it Greg after the lab tech in CSI. I always name my instruments, I have Ricky the trumpet, Greg the guitar, Alex the keyboard and Thom the cabasa. Woo indeed!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe that crocadile hunter guy is dead! I never really was a fan or anything, but he amused me. It kind of depressed me that someone like him had gone. The world needs a Steve Erwin (is that how you spell it?)<br /></div>

"event","<p>Honestly, you think you've missed Sports Day, then you go back to school and its on! Darn. To be honest, it wasn't that bad. I had a wardrobe malfuction (my bra slipped...d'oh!) and it was raining in the beginning, but it was nice and cool tempreture wise. However, I got totally bored so amused myself by playing hide and seek with my Matt Bellamy poster. He was our classes mascot, cheering on our mates in the races. He even made Hanne come 5th which is pretty good, seeing as without him, she could have come 6th.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was ment to be doing shotput today, but I had to go to wind band practise. It was scary as I had to the second trumpet piece on my own! I'm not even a good player! Anyway, it was alright though because Bethan Murphey helped my out with her clarinet.</p>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""A funny game, that might make a wish come true!"">Take 3 minutes and try this...it will freak you out! The<br />person who sent it to me said her wish came true 10 minutes after they read<br />the mail. BUT NO CHEATING! This game has a funny/spooky outcome.<br /><br />Don't read ahead...just do it in order! It takes about three minutes...it's<br />worth a try :)<br /><br />First..get a pen and paper. When you actually choose names, make sure it's<br />people you actually know and go with your first instinct.<br /><br />Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read ahead or you'll ruin it!<br /><br />1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any two numbers you want.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite sex.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON""T TURN OUT RIGHT!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4. Write anyone's name (like friends or family....) in the 4th, 5th,and 6th<br />spots.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />6. Finally, make a wish.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And now the key for the game.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2. The person in space 3 is the one that you love.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />4. You care most about the person you put in 4<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5. The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />9. The tenth space is the song that tells you most about YOUR mind.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel about life<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />NOW...put this on ur blog within the hour you read this...IF you do..your<br />wish will come true.

"event","<p>Sports day on Thursday! ARRRRGGGH! I loathe sports day! Its not really the physical exersion that bothers me, but the waiting around, cheering for people you don't even like and not being able to make a badge stall that really grates. Plus, it is always swealtering and you always get sun burned. Last year, I ran the 800m, the 100m sprint, took part in the javalin and the&nbsp;discus, then I nearly fainted. Seriously. My chest went all hard&nbsp;and tight like a box stuck between elevator doors. Personally, I think I might have asthma, but has my mother ever bothered to&nbsp;take me to the doctors about it?&nbsp;Has she fuck! She'd much rather swan around with her boyfriend, looking at poncing houses than do anything that could one day save my life!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I would seriously have bet my life&nbsp;that they would have just&nbsp;prefered to have waited to have&nbsp;children and I had never been born. Okay, I admit, maybe I wasn't to considerate by describing all the sodding houses as boring, but thats because they blooming were!&nbsp;Both of them! Just boxes with BROWN walls! Yuch, if I want to live in a coffee shop then I would&nbsp;have settled in Starbucks. Anyway, I kind of pissed her off.&nbsp;She had asked me&nbsp;what I had thought of the houses, so I said that they were alright, then asked her what age you can legally move out of your parents house at? So thus, I was Miss Unsensitive Daughter and she was Miss (soon to be Mrs) Long suffering mother. Later she told me that she had put a offer in on&nbsp;this house that I DID really like, but it wasn't to the full asking price as&nbsp;I wasn't worth that much. Cheers...bitch. Just because&nbsp;I'm being childish and petty, doesn't mean she should&nbsp;be. I am the teenager after all!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I've gone off eating. I know that sounds really stupid, like me&nbsp;saying 'I don't fancy breathing today, thanks!', but when I was a kid, I really like eating, mostly sweet stuff, but savoury was great too. Now, I&nbsp;feel less towards sweets than I&nbsp;did, and I sometimes just stuff&nbsp;eating all together. I just don't want to.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know people probebly think I'm a whinger, as it seems everytime I come on livejournal I am a bit cheesed off about something, but I'm not! Really I'm rather cheery and&nbsp;chirpy! Now I'm going to make a&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;say something nice and lovely.<br /></p>

Its just another of those days spent teaching your Dad not to be a homophobe, eating your own weight in chocolate and putting free CDs onto your iPod. Joy. At the moment, I am putting on 'Mellow Gold' which was a gift with Q magazine and 'NME presents FESTIVAL!' which was free with...well, I think you can work it out.
     I've just started this book my mate lent it me, its quite good. Its called Boy Heaven and its a horror story me thinks. Or maybe just another trashy teen novel I find so alluring.
     I am sitting on a kitten about Muse's new album, which is called Black Holes & Revelations. It sounds like its going to fantastico, but I'm not having much luck at the moment with albums. I have the We Are Sceintists album, which I like very much, but at the beginning I was having trouble bonding with it, if you know what I mean.
     I had a wierd dream two nights ago. I dreamt I listened to some Jim Noir song (which I have been wanting to hear for ages) and I was really dissapointed. And that was it. That was the most my imagination could come up with. Simply smashing... Usually they are a bit more spicy than that. I had a amazing Doctor Who one a while ago, which was rather...memorable. I think I was a darlek queen who was in love with Matt Bellamy then I got stuck with the Doctor and we became best friends and went off to the local pub for a pint every Wednesday. I really should stop watching tv, its messing me up.

I have a happy idea of what my birthday present will be. Actually, I more or less know I'm having it as I've been nagging for about 6 months straight. I'm getting this electric guitar which is like the one the Cribs use aswell as a lovely, shiny amp. Huzzah with knobs on!

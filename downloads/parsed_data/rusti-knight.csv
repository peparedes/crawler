"event","So, sometime in the new year, I want to open up for pet portrait commissions. Except, I don't want to just copy a photo like so many do. I have seen some really great artistic stuff pop up once in a while and that's what I want to take a stab at. Be it creative cropping, a cartoon twist, something based on a personality, whatever. Even though I'd need a photo reference, my aim is not to just copy it.

Obviously I will be practicing with my own critters, but I thought I'd do a little something special since it's December and all and do a drawing for one with an animal I don't know.

Rules are: One animal, 9x12 bristol or illustration board in a medium of my choice (probably colored pencil, but I've been known to paint). <i>It won't be done for Christmas!</i> That much I can promise.

It's just one spot, and I'm going to do it by drawing a name randomly. Leave a comment if you're interested!

ETA: You can comment here, or on my Steel Wolf facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/steelwolfgraphics (oh, yes, and the drawing is for a FREE one, sorry I didn't specify completely!)"

"event","OMFG, today has been, well, a disaster is not quite the right word, but stressful certainly is.

<lj-cut text=""This would have been more fun if I hadn't been by myself"">So I get up this morning and airspace over the UK is still closed until 0100 Tuesday morning, which was still not enough to mean that my flight leaving Chicago and arriving at Heathrow at 10am was canceled.  There was no word on cancellation before I had to leave to get on the train, so I had to make a decision to stay or go.  I couldn't simply reschedule, I didn't know when the next available two weeks for vacation were.  So I got on the train.  While the train was stopped in Champaign, my mother called to tell me that she looked at my flight info on BA.com and it said my flight was canceled. And shortly after Neo texts to tell me that Scotland, Wales, Ireland and northern England airspace is open.

Great.

It was too late to get off the train at Champaign and wait for the one home, so I decided to sit it out to Chicago. Got to Chicago and got a ticket home, then called Mom again to make sure that the flight really said canceled.  Well, in between Champaign and Chicago, something had changed and they were now saying I was going to some airport with the initials PIK.  No I idea whatsoever which airport that was.  

So I figure I'd better go to the airport and see what's up anyway.  I wouldn't be back in time for the 4pm train, but if I had to come home, I could still catch the 8pm train to New Orleans (That stops in Carbondale) and go to work the next day.  Get to the airport (CTA and navigating the Airport being the least of my worries - I hate Chicago, but at least their public transit isn't hard) and get in line for check in.  Some guy laughs at me when I tell him what flight I'm on, tells me ""that flight isn't leaving!  hahaha!""   

I just shrugged and told him I'd heard otherwise and I was here to find out.

I guess it was a good thing I did, because my flight *was* leaving.  Only, not at 8:10, but at 11pm, and it's going to Scotland.  And they're going to bus us from Scotland to Heathrow. You know, through the Scottish countryside.  And I'm going to be in such a snit by then I probably won't even be able to enjoy it.

God's sense of humor - sometimes, it seriously sucks.  I have a terrible headache because I can't stop gritting my teeth and this apple and salad I have will be the first decent things I've eaten since yesterday. </lj-cut>

I need a hug."

"event","Now open.  I don&#39;t take these often, if you liked &#39;Fallen&#39; consider this an opening.
Prices vary widely depending on what the job and/or the sculpt is, but nothing starts under $150, .  I&#39;m hoping to make a trip to the UK to visit a friend sometime next year and I need to make some dough to buy the obscenely expensive plane ticket (and I don&#39;t want to sell the Windstones I actually still have...) among other things.

These sculpts are offered by Windstone Editions specifically for the purpose of other artists painting them.  Offered are a small dragon, a large dragon, a unicorn, a griffin, a wolf, a kirin, and a muse.  All can be viewed here: https://www.windstoneeditions.com/shop/paint-your-own/  The out of stock pieces should be restocked soon, hopefully, as the factory is just waiting on a shipment of new gypsum.

Some examples:

I&#39;ve started printing out pictures of the blank statues and coloring in how I&#39;d like to (or you would like me to) paint it, that will be happily included with your piece.

Any questions, plz email me!

I also still have a PYO Wolf in my possession who I&#39;m considering painting as Shiranui from the Okami game to compliment Amaterasu above and to sell.  If anyone would be interested in that, give me a poke.

ETA: Yes, I can finish stuff by Christmas, if you commission soon enough!  It&#39;s a first come first served basis, and It takes me about six to eight weeks to do these at Fallen&#39;s (the griffin&#39;s) level of detail."

So...  These: https://www.windstoneeditions.com/shop/paint-your-own/  are sculptures by Melody Pena and she's kindly offering these specific ones for painting by her fans.

See this post: http://www.windstoneeditions.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=11315 for examples and a few extra details.  I'll have another example to post at the end of the month.

Rates vary widely, but none start under $100 (not including the sculpt) and where they go from there depends on the complexity/size of the sculpt and the complexity of the requested paint job.  I also won't be able to start until I'm finished with the piece I have in the works now, which will be for certain by the end of the month, so you have some time to consider and save.

If you have any questions, just ask!"

Here's the skinny:
Sketches are generally $20-$25 if you commissioned me outside of a sale like this.  I'm going to take 10 sketch commissions at a time at $15 each.

When these are done, I can open up again.  Most subjects are OK, and if I have my doubts about what you're requesting, or of I'm completely repulsed by a request, I'll let you know.

Pay before I draw, and I prefer paypal, but I'll take a money order.  You can request more than one slot (two separate sketches = 2 slots) and first pay first drawn. (Oh, and paypal is webmaster at steel-wolf dot com, replaces words with appropriate symbols and removes spaces.  :) )"

I finished the first one tonight.  It's genuine malachite and black onyx, sterling silver chain and a pewter dragon pendant/centerpiece.  The black ring joining the dragon and the necklace is a Swarovski crystal comsic ring.

As before, half payment is required upon time of order to webmaster@steel-wolf.com via paypal.  You can drop a comment to order, or you can just send payment with: 

the shirt you want
your shirt size
the color of collie.

Or, if you don't have/don't want to use paypal, I also have a Google checkout account and I can email you an invoice.

If you want one of the juniors sizes, they run very small, and I do have measurement charts for them, so I'll need to know inches instead of sizes for those.

I can ship internationally, but I must warn you that it'll cost more and take about 2 weeks at the least to get to you.

I will let this offer run until May 28th, whereupon I will order shirts and print when they arrive.  If you have any questions, or what a different color shirt than white, feel free to ask, the worst I can do is say that I can't order that color."

Most is furry stuff I just want to get gone since I don't do much in the way of anthro art anymore.  Some are prints that I did not do that I somehow acquired from the 'please, take it!"" pile the print shop at SIU had last spring.  And the rest are from figure drawing two years ago.

And also, the figure drawing grab bag!  For $15 you get one piece of scribbled on brown paper which amounts to no more than a sketch, usually and one piece of white paper which has a more finished sketch with some shading.  This one is a first come first serve, when I run out, I'm out!  For an extra $20, I'll throw in a *finished* drawing done on black paper in white charcoal.  None of these figure drawing pieces are in super shape, as they've been rolled up and stacked against the wall for two years now, but if stretched and framed tightly or pressed under a heavy book, they should be OK.

Also keep in mind that in figure drawing, the figures are *gasp* tastefully nude.

First come first serve on everything, I'm not going to make this a bidders war, I just want to get rid of this stuff.  Comment or email to grab what you want.  You are also responsible for shipping charges, First class USPS (which usually only amount to a couple bucks.)

Paypal only for this sale, plz!"

This would be something more appealing to the masses.  It'd be one color on a black shirt.

"event","Kay, here's the skinny.

I have ONE screen.  I can do ONE color, ONE shirt at a time.  With contact paper stencils and drawing fluid/screen filler (waiting on Hobby Lobby to get screen filler in, which should hopefully be by the end of this week).  Multiple colors are not out of the question, it just won't go very fast, and I cannot do huge numbers of shirts (10 or more, I think) at a time right now.

I am not set up for photo emulsion (super detailed things) yet.  Drawing fluid isn't super limited, but if the design you have in mind has lots of small spots of color/fine lines/is just plain complicated I can't do it yet.  That's coming.  Just not right now.  There's still a few things I have to set up/build yet.

I think for one color on one shirt with a fairly simple design that won't take me long to paint onto the screen with the drawing fluid  I'll start things at $10 per shirt (the more shirts done with that one design and that one color, I can knock a little off, since setting up is the booger, actual printing takes no time at all - say you got five shirts with the same single color design, I could lower prices to $8.00 a shirt).  I'm still figuring out rates for more colors, though I think it'd be safe to count on at least $10 per color for one shirt.

As long as you have a design ready for me.

I will be happy to do the artwork for you, but I will charge you a design fee.

For now, email me if you're interested.  Later on I hope to be able to set up a form through the website for this."

"event","So I enjoyed that endeavor  this past semester, and will be doing it again in a mad flurry for a month this summer.  I've been thinking about getting the things I need to do it here at home, like a screen, ink, screen filler, drawing fluid, clamps for my drafting table, squeegees, etc.

I filled up the cart on dickblick.com with the things I'd need and the total comes to about <strike>$132</strike> $165 (added a couple more screens to the order).  Not including shipping.

Now, in order for me to be willing to drop that amount, I've got to know that folks are gonna buy.  Silk screen equipment means I can do custom t-shirts more or less fairly easily.  The cost, of course, would be better for those who bought several, as opposed to those who only wanted, say, one shirt/pair of paints/canvas bag/whatever due to the cost of the shirt design, inks, shirt itself, whathaveyou.

Would any of you be interested?  I'm just testing the waters, here.

Edit: Tell ya what...  I think in order for me to drop the funds on the equipment (and put the screw holes for the clamps in my drafting table...) I'll have to take pre-orders.  Keeping in mind that everything will be done by hand.  I won't have a machine, it'll just be me.  Prices will depend on quantity (the more bits of clothing you order with the same design, the less *per piece* it will be) complexity of your design, number of colors in the design, and whether or not I have to make your design for you, or if you give me something all set to go.  Lots of variables, I know, but it's more simple than you think.  Preordering will require a non-refundable deposit, because I'll be using it to order not only the equipment, but your clothing stuffs too!  Email me at rusti_knight at steelwolfgraphix.com and let's chat."

By wednesday I have to read: 73 pages in my typography book, have an exercise done where I've drawn four different versions of a letter I've picked out and plucked out of magazines and be started with my first assignment which has to have a rough version (close-ups of the same letters used in the exercise) ready for discussion and crit Monday

By Thursday I've got a woodblock project *due* in printmaking.  As in, have it drawn on the wood, sealed, carved out (while running proofs during carving) and a <u>dry</u> print ready to turn in at the beginning of class Thursday (unless the guy changes his mind, guess we'll see).

I have some reading to do in my art history book, though that class is coming up next here in a little under an hour, to keep caught up with that class.

On top of:
a commission with a deadline of very early february
a pyo wolf (with no deadline, but she's sitting next to my computer among the paints, staring at me accusingly so I don't forget her, not that T would let me)
reading material for reference for future commissions
my own personal artwork which never seems to get done (dancing wolf, Rusti/Beast and Rusti/Viper)
sexy AU fic
and I've started writing on my book.


Holy cow I think my schedule just exploded at the seams.  I'm having one of those dilemmas where I'm not sure which way I should turn first!!  And I don't even have another job yet."

Spread the word, folks, I could use the extra cash.  I actually have to buy books for my classes this semester.  :P"

I didn't come away with too much this year, but I am getting a Mac PowerBook and the software I need from my parents, God bless 'em, so I don't have to take out a loan to pay for it, so I don't have much room to complain.

I did get:

A Wacmon Graphire graphics tablet
a george foreman grill (which rocks, I needed/wanted one)
The Fox and The Hound on DVD
two gift cards to Hobby Lobby
A gift card to Bath and Body Works
silver jewelry and $20 from my aunt
a nice little jingly dance ankle bracelet in my stocking, which I wore all evening.  It was a nice, comfortable weight there on my ankle
and multiple other random goodies that turn up in stockings


For those of you who do happen to be online this late on Christmas night, I'm desperately trying to get AIM downloaded on my dad's racing laptop, but the stupid thing is slow as a seven year itch.  The monitor on my parent's big computer went up in sparks this evening, which was really sort of entertaining, but put a kink in things 'net-wise.

My ear is still all plugged up and weird, so I got to listen to myself chew my Christmas dinner and the candy turtles in my stocking.  Found out that my dog *will* get ugly if people toss me around.  I got to wrestling with my dad and she reached out and latched onto his leg, not once, but twice in a way that suggested she wasn't exactly kidding (she and my dad play really rough - but this was a 'stop it!' thing, I think).  I shouldn't have laughed, but I did.

It still doesn't quite feel like Christmas without Grandma, who we lost 6 years ago, but we had a good day anyway.

Merry Christmas everybody!  I'll catch y'all 'round 11 pm or so tomorrow, since I work from 2-10:30.  I imagine we'll have a lot of clothes to be putting away tomorrow evening.  Should be a blast.  :P"

if you read this I'm sure you know I had depression until about four years ago i'm now worried its coming back. I've sort help and I relatively possitive about it that is until this afternoon.

I got back from the GP this afternoon after waiting three weeks to see them (WTF) and when I opened the packet of my perscription I was horrified. I've heard all the horror stories about seroxat and never would agreed to the perscription had I known thats what he was giving me. Having read a few things online I'm now even more scared. This stuff is really hard to come off 

I really dont want to take it but I'm worried if I dont my GP isnt going to take me seriously. I know what i need that a little CBT and maybe a little bit of group to help me through my final year of uni and through job hunting beyond that 

Charlotte
P.S if you read this its more to do with me wanting to record this in someway I'm not trying to illcit sympathy/responses"

I also have to make a corset. I wish I'd known that before I could have arranged someone to make it for. the thing is now its too late. well I could make it for someone they'd have to come round for fitting and measureing though in the week of the 10th May with a fitting possibly on 18th May

Shes also been a cow today making me redo my button holes Four times today and those where only the samples. I know she right but I cant help but feel shes grumpy about it. 

Also Im writing the sickest jokes atm my latest tweet reads 

""You know you shouldn't be going to a theatre uni when your reaction to another redgrave death is: Oh well, three down two to go""

I know wrong but I cant stand the redgraves especially vanesssa did you see her on the baftas bowing and scraping to that twat prince william. Shes come along way from her workers revolutionary party days hasnt she stupid cow. anyway enough bile for the day.

Also theres no Tom and Alex  on triple j ( Australia equalent to 6music) to listen to they usually keep me cheerful in the face of adversity

One positive note the theme for the end of year exhibition is tea party which rocks and I get to work on it Yay me. bring it on I say"

<lj-cut text=""panic attack"">
Today I had what has to be my worst ever panic attack even thought that would have been quite easy to achieve I know it was still a really extreme one I still feel quite shaky even though its been about six hours since it happened and I've subsequently been to my group and talked about it.

today was one of those really bad really good days. In the morning I had fashion drawing and everything seemed to go wrong I got paint on my wool skirt drew loads of really dreadful drawings then I did fuck all in my afternoon class. After classes I was having a great funny chat with a friend then I had my appointment with the learning support teacher for help with my dyslexia which was actually really great even if some of the test where really hard. We where doing reading exercises which I find really hard then she gave me a sheet of yellow acetate to put over my work and what previously looked like a swirling mess suddenly looked really clear and much easier to read. I this was really great but it made me cry cause I something so simple could have such a miraculous almost magical result. It also made me cry because I've struggled for years of anxiety,angst and anger with this shit.When I left college I was standing on the Holloway Rd and I've lost my travelcard so I decide go to the nearest safe place my parents house I'm sitting on the bus snuffling away feeling a bit sorry for myself. 

By the time I get to my parents road I'm starting to hyperventilate it was getting worse and worse I'm standing in the middle of the road having a really bad panic attack gasping for breathing hopping to god that nobody passes me and thinks OMG look at that fat cow she so fat she cant even walk down the street with out getting out of breathe or even worse someone stopping to help me cause I look like I'm choking or dying or something. When I get to my parents door its just getting worse I barely manage to focus enough to knock on their door and out that its me they open the door and I collapse in the hall way I cant  breathe, I cant see properly, my chest is pounding and I cant speak they're panicking cause they think something serious has happened they've never seen me in the midst of an attack of anxiety even the mild kind they think I'm seriously ill or I've been attacked it seemed like several minutes before I could get myself calm enough to breathless tell them I'm having a panic attack. My dads freaking out he didn't even now I get panic attacks let alone knowing anything about them. Thank God I knew what it was and am familiar enough with the symptoms of panics to know this is whats happening otherwise it would have been even more fucking scary. 

Im still feeling fucking shaky and absolutely exhausted.

"event","I've decided to appeal the DWP's decession to deny me income support but in the mean time I've had to apply for jobseekers allowence too even though I'm not really able to work. but my family dont support me in this appeal but then they dont really understand how ill I have been.

The thing is I want a job I really would like to work but I know looking for a job would leave me suicidal ( I wrote to the DWP and told them this) I dont want to be thrown in at the deep end and be made to get a full time job  or part time job with college and then get sacked because I'm too depressed to work.

I know I have to get a job this year and have always know that (especially if I want to go to uni) but i want to do the search at my own pace with help from my psychiatrist ad the the DWP I know they do give help. i dont want to go back to my doctor I dont want to go on anti depressents again they didnt do me much good when I did take them they made me more anxcious. 

My family think that because I was relitively sucessful at college last year that I'm okay enough to work but the thing is that college wasn't like work for starters its only half and hour from my house secondly It never a full day and but for the kindness of alot of my teachers I wouldnt have passed.  I also missed alot of college about 10-20% of my classes because I was ill or too anxcious to leave home.

The odd thing is my parents have offered to help me fincially through my Foundation which is really great of them but it kind misses the point."

Yesterday I got a letter from the DWP telling me my claim for income support is going to stop because they don't think I'm not ill enough at the moment I haven't stopped crying since this happened.

I want to die I feel like someone's pulled the rug from under me. My psychiatrist is away my family are going away from tomorrow morning and I feel so alone."

Its a really great movie. I went to see it today with my sister because I really love 40's & 50's pin-up art and I the photos I've seen of her are really beautiful. Although It does  turn your image of what you imagine she was like on its head. Its great because its not just a saucy film its really intelligent and really makes you think while being really entertaining its got a fantastic female cast it beautifully shot  and Gretchen Mole who plays Betty is really gorgeous.

My only criticism of the film is that it left me wanting to know more about what she was actually like both as a child and after she stopped modelling.

If you love the Images of pin up art like Vargas Girls and Betty Page then you have to see this movie."

"event","not cause of the absolutely minuscule risk of being involved in a terrorist attack but because of these stupid new rules they're imposing on hand luggage Jesus they are just plain ridiculous 

new security measure include no hand luggage no bottles cases or packages of any kind (except for essential medication) no electronic equipment of any kind that includes mobile phone, music players etc.

basically your only allowed to take are your passport, ticket, money and keys (as long as they're not electronic) and enough medicine supplies for the flight including sanitary products which have to be unpackaged and baby food which must all be tasted upon check in by the passenger and those are only the new restrictions on luggage.

Will these marvellous new restrictions on our freedom prevent terror attacks? No of course not their not even proportionate to the risk we face and whats going to happen when they foil the next attack?What's next were all going to have to be handcuffed to our seats!

in the end the thing that annoys me is that this is so symptomatic of whats going on our rights are being eroded on every front in the name of security which we don't really need.its not going to stop terrorism it probably wont stop them trying to blow us up its just going If they had discovered a new aeroplane safety feature that would save as many if not more lives do you think they'd be in a rush to do it no it all just hysteria"

Its still too hot here 34C today but the 5 day forcast says it going to be 24-25C this weekend and rainy too *schreeks with delight* If the forcast holds out Im going to go to the west end on saturday and the tate britain on sunday and if the weather last into next week I've got to go to tate britain too. Oh please let this be the end of it. I dont want to spend my holiday feeling horrible and uncomfortable. I dont think this is the end of it though I have a horrible sinking feeling it going to last till september bluuuuuurgh

I actually managed to go out yesterday first thing in the morning though went and brought food and some more fabric I brought some summery black anglaise cheesecloth which will be a nice long skirt.

I have quite a few ideas of things I want to make one is for a flare grey skirt with appliqued skulls in loads of different coloured fabrics all piled on top of each other I have the main fabric I almost have the pattern and the applique design nicked from G&LB extra vol 2 but I just need the fabric Oh yeah and my new machine cause if i asked my current machine to do it I think it might die, poor little pet lamb I've had it for about eight years and it was a little cheepy as well its lasted pretty well bless it."

"event","I cant stand this everything just feels like one massive waiting game till september. Right now I'm bored, tired and far to fucking hot. I cant be arsed to do anything at all. Today my big adventure into the outside world was supposed to be me going and shopping for food but I didnt go I stayed at home and did fuck all! WTF I cant manage to do anything at the moment not even sewing. 

I'm house sitting in a very tall house I'm rattling around in it and I think being away from all my distracting comforts like my computer doesnt help my sewing machines are here but I dont really have anywhere comfortable to set them up. 

Also I cant bring myself to cook or eat all I do is drink thought that might have something to do with it.


August looks like its going to turn into one long film four marathon.

last night I watched 
Team America - utter crap
and memoirs of a geisha which to be honest although it was pretty I found the DVD extras more interesting than the movie

Tonight I'm going to watch 
Brazil by Terry Gilliam.
and 
Dark Habits by Pedro Almodavar 
I think that the only film of his I havent actually seen expect for any shorts he may have made 

Monday is 
Duck Soup 

see what I mean!"

"event","Oh my god what have I got myself into for my textiles course I have loads of coursework reasearch to justify my final piece of work. the original theme of the project was native americans. and when we went to the british museum to have a look at there work I saw a really lovely squaws dress which had been decorated with elks teeth 

it really captured my imagination and I was inspired by it to make something similar for a modern american women and I decided to design something 1950's inspired but instead of being for a squaw it would be for a airforce wife I was going to design fifties style dress made from blue gingham decorated with her husband Kills in much the same way as they used to do on WW2 bombers and fighters but I dont want to decorate a skirt with bombs symbols cause that would be tooo obvious and boring so I'm or embleshing the dress with atomic mushroom clouds and atomic symbols  

The problem is the research I have to do to back this up is huge"

Since I left that tailoring course I've been so happy its amazing I just didnt realise how stressed and anxcious it was making me and how miserable I was over all that stuff. I think it was a case of not realising my limitations I'm fine when I'm doing one course and can devote my energy to that but doing two wasnt a good Idea. I was always tired allways overworked depressed anytime that wasnt spent working I spent feeling miserable about work. 

I'm sure your sick of this now so this is going to be my last post on the matter. I promise."

I saw him that time on Jonathan Ross show and thought Hmm slightly insane, extremely eccentric, sex obsessed ex-junkie who is obviously extremely intelligent and well read with a natty but strange taste in threads, that's the comedian for me oh yes I've been listening to his radio show on Sundays on 6 Music and that man is as mad as a bag of spiders kinda like Noel Fielding gone bad mad and dangerous to know almost like a modern day libertine lords knows we could do with some of those again. I want to go see him live at the hen and chickens in Islington but alas my social circle being what it is I have no one who will go with Oh well such is life.

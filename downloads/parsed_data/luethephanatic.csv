WHY are these people on my myspace? a few girls in your brother's class add you, hoping you will get your brother's attention to them. you ex boyfriends are all on their, their siblings, their friends...some of which are still your friends...some of which don't really remember your name. um...lindsey? no...wait...um, laura? close, darling, but no. go back to your little seat, now dear. its ok. but, you keep them. and why? because, well, because everyone likes to go through their friends list and laugh at someone's new haircut...or the picture of some girl licking a pole...or w/e people have put up as their new pics. and you just...don't comment. because you OVERTHINK your comment too much. your friends? easy, just leave a 'we're basically getting it on on my car next weekend. with the ketchup.' and its fine. they understand your sense of humor, they are in on it. and they love you, even if you're corny and silly and ridiculous.

poor joaquin, or cain, why isn't he favored? who decides what is better, who gets more? if god prefered abel with no reason (check the bible, there is NO REASON...stupid abel) then WHY is that? are some people just naturally...better? and if so, should the rest of us just give up? what kind of world is this where no matter what you do, someone is always better?

on the other hand, if joaquin/cain could just...live and let live the demons of their soul wouldn't have tormented them. but, then again, if we're going all religious and god is all powerful...DO THEY HAVE A CHOICE? maybe they are just MADE to be tormented by inner demons?

drove a weird thing. through duck blinds. got to hang out with josh. he's so fucking amazing. AMAZING, i say. and i got a PICTURE. and he kept coming around to hang out. and he spent HOURS at the club with my grandparents while i was gone, even though he had a 9 month anniversary date that night. the whole fam thought he was hoping i'd come home, n that he was hanging with my grandparents on the chance i might get home early. and i WOULD have been if my aunts hadn't not let me. i pouted. he DID show me how to drive the funky gator-like thingy. it was SWEET. did i mention he has a beat up old pickup and does manual labor around the club? or that he's grown his hair out? or that..well. he has a gf. for 9 months now. and he said he wasn't going to college. said he was gonna drive tractors for the rest of his life. was he teasing? god, could u imagine if anything DID happen and, heaven forbid, i was stuck in missouri and my husband DROVE TRACTORS FOR A LIVING? come on. WHERE would i shop? where would i get MONEY to shop? i mean, sure, having roland (pronounced 'raw-lend' thank you!)

i ran through a train. as in, climbed through a MOVING TRAIN. sure, it was almost stopped it was going so slow, but STILL. i felt VERY dangerous. lol.

but my mom smashed my toe, i was so covered in mosquito bites i was swollen randomly, i traveled the HARDEST WAY POSSIBLE (plane to detroit, connector to indianapolis, drove 5 hoursa from indianapolis to st louis with 7 ppl in a minivan). and i drank too much with my cousins. i swear, never ending supply of alcohol...is that all ppl do there? roland is NEVER without a beer in hand, yet never drunk. he drives all over the place with his pack of busch. but i love hi. arlene and roland, their daughter kim n her hubby, and josh and his bro shane. i would SO marry into that fam. except. josh is gonna drive tractors."

'look, lauren, isn't this a fun car? and its in your price range. in two or three years it'd be all paid. dont' you like it? HA! dumbass, you thought you could have it? funny. get your ass back on the bus with the freshmen. you want me to pick you up from work? from school? FUNNY. get a carpool, freak!'

i hate them. i'm NOT carpooling with Blair Lord this year. FUCK THAT. they don't wanna lemme get a car? FINE. they can come get me. jesus!

and i said 'cinque' in spanish today. *sigh* i need to finish Imadoki. i'll feel better once Tanpopo and Koki end up happily ever after. living vicariously through other people's pretty lives is fun. damn parents. like its MY fault my cousin died in a car accident because she was DRUNK and the drivers were DRUNK and they weren't wearing seat belts and they had stolen someone's car? right.

will keeps talking to me...his lizard died. ugh. if i don't talk to him i'm a bitter ex gf. so i talk. i hate him.

anyway, i've been reading more Yuu Watase! since finishing Fushigi Yugi and Ceres, i have taken on Imadoki and Alice 19th. i also picked up a Cowboy Bebop, but...idk, i got a bit confused and idk if i'm gonna be continuing it. i ALSO picked up Loveless, but it was...sad that his very NAME was loveless. and this old guy liked him. and he is LITTLE. i mean, he still has his EARS! (which apparently means he's a kid AND a virgin...idk). anyway, he's, like, in junior high. and...idk, i dun get it.

i like imadoki and alice 19th, tho. they remind me of ceres and fushigi yugi. the whole unrequited love thing...or the forbidden love thing. its all so tragic and upsetting. and cute. books. just another reason why my ideas of real life and love are totally screwed up. omg. my song. just came on. Like We Never Loved At All.



have you ever wondered if your parents would like you if they knew what you'd done? or...if they were your age, would they like you? i don't think mine would. i think...i think they'd really, REALLY hate me.

"event","so, whats with names? they don't have anything to do with who you are. i have a name thing, though. does it happen with everybody? tell me, because, seriously...i think its weird. i have a multiple person name thing. lemme explain. my uncle, my dad's only brother, married a linda. my dad then married a linda (my mom). my uncle divorced linda 1. he remarried. another woman named linda. we joke about it and call them 1, 2, and 3. but thats WEIRD don't you think? but, then, my aunt's (dad's sister) is now dating a woman named linda. that would be 4. 4 lindas. WEIRD. my dad's name is John. my mom's sister married a John. my mom's OTHER sister married a Sean - which is john in gaelic (so he says). that's 3 johns.

i also have other ppl who repeat. guys who repeat. i have a matt thing and a josh thing and a david thing. there are two joshs, the one i dated and the one i'm marrying. there are a few david's. the david who is josh's cousin, the david in my class, and the david who is ben's friend, a real sweetie. there are a few matt's. the one i loved in 6th grade, the one my friend emily loved in 6th grade, the one who beat up my best friend in 8th grade. and then, of course, there is the matt i cursed and who then fell off a four wheeler and ended up in a hospital for a few days. cuz, yeah, i'm powerful. that's the 3RD time that's happened. but, anyway. this matt. we were talking about my cousin's upcoming wedding. and, well, i forgot about my uncle's side of the family...which OBVIOUSLY would be invited cuz they're related to my cousin. which MEANS...

matt. i hate him. he's always been around and annoying. like the time he nearly drowned me in the pool, made fun of my braces (he had them too), and then his dad teased me about liking him. which was crap, but how do you tell a dad that you wish his son would fall off a cliff? when they say 'well, you may not like boys, lauren, but MY son is a good one, ain't he?' what do you say? 'actually, he's the WORST' ? no. so i just went red and said 'he's...not bad'. god. i hate him. i mean, maybe he's grown up. but probably not.

FORTUNATELY. at my cousin's wedding there will be OLDER guys. and i'll be 18. :). my cousin is 28. meaning he has older guy friends. hehehe"

will was different. will didn't even talk to me in school when we WERE dating, so it just didn't matter when we broke up. nobody noticed, nobody knew, and nobody cared. except me. i cared. because i ALWAYS care. and then, it happened, he wanted to be friends. do you know what 'friends' means to him? it means he wants to be able to complain, brag, or talk about his love life. constantly. to me. or hook up randomly when he's horny and bored. riiiiight. cause thats what i want. but that was will. i know not every one is the same. but i still...don't know. you know? and i guess i'm just sorry. a bit pathetic to say that, i suppose, because, really, what am i sorry ABOUT? but still.

ack, so, signora basically took my pedastol Lorenzo down today whith her horrible comments. it started out as harmless fun, you know? we were telling stories in italian about our summer vaca. and so i got asked about the guy in the picture with me that i've plastered on my binder to remind me why i take Italian with that witch. well...apparently, signora has this horrible tendency to want to embarass people. she was all 'chi e Lorenzo?' so i was like 'um, idk...he was just like 'che ora e?' ' and she BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. and minutes later, she brings it up again, saying that italian guys just wait around monuments n stuff waiting for foreign girls to walk by. she made me feel awful. like, <p><p><b>No, Lauren, that boy wasn't interested in you, silly!

i was told there would be three kids. one 7, one 8, and one 9. well. there were 6. and the youngest was 8. his name was evan, he was cute. maggie, the only girl, was 8.5, and a real firecracker. ryan was a DOLL, at 10 yrs old. from there u've got danny at 12, christian and 13, and patrick at 14. yeah. so, needless to say, i was a bit...shocked. but it was fun. they were hyper. i didn't eat much. there was a cute waiter. the guys were pretty cute. all dressed up in lil tuxes.

and ryan hit on me. first he told maggie that i won the round of slapjack...because i was older, more mature, and cuter than she was. lol. next, he mumbled SOMETHING and i was like 'huh? what?' n he blushes and goes...'nothing...' and maggie goes 'he said you have nice clothes' and i wa slike 'you like my outfit?' n he goes 'yeah...its nice, its really cute' and i just laughed and said thanks.

it was cute, when i left, i got lots of hugs...and tickles, and ryan gave me a kiss on the cheek and the flower from his jacket. maggie said he was in love and he goes 'its not like i'll ever see her again' omg, they were just TOO CUTE. it was adorable. how she puts up with so many boy cousins is beyond me. but, still...i LOVED them. i'm sad i'll never babysit for them again. they are all so cute. maggie said when she was my age she was coming after my clothes. omg, the kids were just...such a hoot.


and, ok, patrick and christian were, like, older, but they still seemed...little and cute. i mean, christian seemed like SUCH a cutie...wicked young. you know? and all the older guys kept going 'come on, guys, lets go downstairs and dance...come ON!' it was cute. just cute. i liked them. the fingers. finger...what a funny name.




i heart ryan. lol."

"event","just watche Emma with Gwnyth Paltrow. its such a good movie. mr. knightly is just a hero.

i got my new book in the mail. and my lodoss war dvds. now i've got the whole collection. i can start my anime marathon watching any day now. nothing like skimpy-dressed elves kicking butt and guys who look kinda girly except for their oddly proportioned shoulders and muscles. not to mention to constant baring of random skin. and the facial expressions. and the water droplets that appear next to their heads...

only i got a text from Ben today. said 'just got off the boat' by boat he means sub. he's so...old now. married. divorcing. i miss him. i knwe when he got married everything would change. we used to talk, you know? like, really talk. we dated REAL briefly, and we made better friends cuz of the distance thing. but, i mean, we've been friends since i was in 8th grade. i learned everything about...everything from him. if it weren't for him and nick, and tidbits from various random ppl, i'd be LOST about sex. honestly. nobody was more honest. a bit blunt, but hey. guess thats why i'm so strange about it. i miss talking, though. there is nothing like talking to a guy friend. and i feel like i don't have any anymore. ben was my best. we'd talk for hours. and, you know, i've been there for him. when his whole school was calling him gay cuz of a night that went bad with a girl. when he got in a fight with another guy over this freshman girl...who ended up not wanting to date him. i believe he was a junior then. i was even there when he was making BIG decisions. like...whether to join the military or get married and work for his wife's dad. RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. i suggested the military. i guess i figured that way he'd at least...travel a bit, get out and do something, and...you know...not rely on his high school sweetheart forever. and...he DID move to CT. which was closer to me. and we stayed close. talked ALL the time. well, until he got x-box. which is why i dumped him. but then, the x-box went away and we became good friends again. and then....he got married. now we don't talk.

this happens to me. makes me kinda wonder if i have a bad personality. i mean, bad looks someone can excuse with 'she's got a great personality' but a bad personality is RARELY made up for with 'she's got an ok figure...' or 'sometimes, her hair looks nice' or 'if she's wearing heels, her legs look good'...what if i chase people away with my personality? surely there are SOME people who don't find me repulsive...but what if those are only girls? what if guys can't stand me on principle? i go through guy friends too quickly. they disappear.

well, i suppose there will always be Pat. he's a sweetheart, no Mr. Knightly, but a sweetheart."

"event","you know those days when its just like ... DAMN! things are good! today? was one of them. it started out with a gorg. shower and then pancakes. omg, they made me PANCAKES. then...work. which was, like, madd weird. like, ok, awkward ppl today

one dude was like 'does this puppy look sad to you? i think he's sad...he's like *continues in a strange baby voice* 'why did you take my picture in black and white? don't you like my pretty yellow hair?' ' meanwhile, he's standing, like, on top of my. his elbow was, like, resting in my side. like, hello? personal space?

then, this foregin dude with an accent comes in for ribbon, right? he's, like, indian or mid-eastern or sumthing. so i search and search for the PERFECT ribbon. and then he wants to know how much he can get for 15$. so, ok, math? NOT MY STRONG SUIT. so, like, i'm trying to figure out how to even work it out on a calc. only i can't. so he's like 'let me' and he does. and me n kate crack up cuz he's gettin all, like, weird, u kno? THEN he wants me to roll the ribbon, so i'm rolling it around my hands and he comes back to help me. he's all 'hey...let me help you.' and he, like, gives me this WICKED weird face and comes behind the counter and starts uncurling the ribbon. like...um...hi? wtf are you doing? step back!

it was just weird. oh, and i had delic. taco bell taco.

then, kate n i hit starbucks and flint. omg, the hawties in starbucks make me smile. the one guy called me peanut. HE HAS A NICKNAME FOR ME. course, he said he calls everyone peanut. STILL. and i madd flirted with the OTHER guy there. omg, i LOVE them. heh, n they thought i was in college. damn. still, that guy is MINE. or, at least, my brother. mmmm.

THEN WE GOT A PEDICURE AND OMG. it was basically MADDDDDDDDDD SICK. i am in love. my feet feel, like, amazing. kate n i had a blast. there was a foot massage, leg massage, and a flippin NECK massage. it was soooooooooo nice. we're doing it again. asap.

then i saw STEP UP. and i'm telling you, channing tatum (or w/e his name is) is the flippin HOTTEST guy. omg. i was like, 'omg, alli, is he fucking gorgeous or whaaaat?' and he is. i am basically in love with him. and i need to be able to dance. dancing is sweet. leastways, he looked good doing it n i'd dance with him.



OMG, WHAT AN AMAZING DAY!!! i even FEEL like i look hotter than usual. lol. i'm, like, soooooooo hyped up. and, no, its not the coffee. i think i only had two. or three. but w/e. its not that. my legs are soooo smooth and my feet aer so pretty...and i'm just...idk. i got nice legs, i think. i mean, lol, nvm. i can't be weird. i'm just geekin out. omg. i gotta go. i'm so syked.

"event","i found that i'm a babysitter for rent. my boss is basically telling brides i'm available to babysit during weddings. i'm going to a wedding next saturday to watch three kids i don't know. i won't know a single person there. at all.

um, matt has messaged Alli. he wants to visit. i hope he does. i haven't seen him since 6th grade. we were basically in love. he bought me a stuffed cat. and perfume. only he never gave me the perfume because my friend kyle sprayed himself down with it and everyone was going 'omg, kyle, you reek!' he took me to the valentine's day dance. only, i was really silly and immature and i hid from him. he dressed up, tho, looked real nice. not REALLY dressy, just...you know. he wore a polo.

he and the OTHER matt had a 'party' that year. it was, basically, a dance. but it wasn't school related. it was on the navy base. his dad n the other matt's dad were in the navy. our class was always full of navy kids. they always left...anyway, the dance was the first, and i think last dance/party thing i've been to. you know, that was that huge with...dancing. and, yeah, alli n i went together. but we told EVERYONE no. because we were dumb. and shy and immature. matt pouted on a couch. his brother was on a separate couch making out with this girl, sara.

he wrote me a note he day he left for...um...ohio or w/e. in really bad handwriting. and...he signed my yearbook 'thanks for the dances you gave me'

and i want him to visit...only i don't. cuz he probably won't like the person i am now. i'm not half so...spit-fire and crazy as i was. i'm not so...dumb. and that was probably what he liked. that i argued and was loud and took on the guys in our class. they said one thing, i was DETERMINED to prove the opposite. i was an amazingly annoying kid. no wonder most of the boys hated me. i picked on them. in a dumb way.


omg...i'm being scary and reminiscent. somebody stop me!"

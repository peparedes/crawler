"event","So, I've been a terrible updater of late...the police should come and arrest me for negligence, really. So many, many, many things have happened since I last posted...I can't even remember when I last posted. Oh well, time to start again!<br /><br />So, I'm at college, and stuff. I absolutely love it here. It's amazing. It's beautiful. I'm taking courses I'm interested in. I'm involved in a whole bunch of music things. The house I live in is fantastic and close to almost everything on campus. My roommate is fabulous. Northampton is the craziest fucking town ever and I love it. It was a lot at first to take in, but once I put the posters up in my room, made some friends, practiced cello at any time of the day I felt like, and walked around in the sunshine, it was OK. It hasn't really stopped being OK. And I'm very OK with that....OK? XD<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""READING! READING! READING!, Music, Religion...My Life Thus Far at Smith...""><br />SO. First things first. Classes I is a taking. I think they're very interesting, with the exception of the last one, and you shall read why... A Cultural History of Britain and its Empire, 1688-1914. I love, love, LOVE the British, and so, this class is awesome for me. It's mostly lecture, take notes, read a whole lot. But I like the reading, it interests me. We read and watched the Beggar's Opera last week, and although I could hardly understand the words through their incredibly thick accents, it was very enjoyable just the same. I'm also taking Elementary Latin which is still review for me at the moment, but that's fine. It's good to have one slightly easy class during the week. I don't know if it's a thing with all Latin teachers, but this one marches to the beat of her own drum as well and it's fabulous. My third course is called Western Classics: Homer to Dante. Basically a course ALL ABOUT FANTASTIC LITERARY CLASSICS *swoons* We're reading the Iliad now (the girls in my house watched Troy last Friday XD ) and although it is a LOT of reading sometimes (200 pages in three days WTF...that was a read-til-3am marathon...) it's completely worth it. The professor is a little crazy, but very passionate about the classics and very good at teaching them.<br /><br />My last class, for me, I feel, deserves a paragraph of its own. Intro to World Religions. It sounded interesting the night before I registered for classes and I figured with no knowledge of religions in general (something that seems very ignorant in this day and age), and with an Atheist perspective, it might be interesting to see what the rest of the world believes in and why. Oh. My. God. No pun intended. It's taught by two female professors and it's just...I don't know...it'd be repetitive to say that religion's not my thing...but this class.. I don't know, it's not sinking in at all the way I want to learn about it and it's completely frustrating. I've talked to a few people about it and gotten some really good advice... I understand what we're learning (so far just Hinduism...started Confucianism today) and the tenets of the religion, who follows them, what it means to follow them, all that stuff. All&nbsp; the factual stuff I can grasp. But as to WHY anyone would believe it...it's beyond me. And it sounds so ignorant to me to say that, but I feel like I can't participate in class at all because my viewpoint is that I really don't have one on the subject... for some reasons I can't pretend to accept it personally for the length of one class for the sake of questioning the professors. It's like there's some kind of mental barrier against even just pretending...? That sounds so stupid when I say it like that, but there it is. I think though, I may have a better way to relate to the class in my own weird way, which I discovered while walking back from Sage Hall tonight from Wind Ensemble!<br /><br />Prepare for the trite moment that really isn't meant to be trite, just true. I've never phrased the thought in this way before and to do so is a bit startling to me, but nice just the same. Music is my religion. I've been noticing it more and more. Whatever religion means to some people, music means to me. That might sound incredibly cheesy, but for me it's the complete truth. It's a comfort, it's always with me, I'm never without it...sounds like religion or belief or faith or whatever else you call it...serves the same purpose. I hope that helps me in class some how....It might be a spiritual thing...I don't consider myself a spiritual person in any way...music just lifts me like nothing else does and whatever you want to call it....THERE I SAID IT *pushes chair back from table in triumph*<br /><br />Moving on...yes, this is going to be one of Mary's usual novel-length entries that she's SURE no one really reads...and now she's typing in third person... any who.... I went to a concert last week downtown and this little restaurant/performance artist hole in the wall that was actually pretty cool. I saw Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Has - this duet, former is 50ish, Scottish, plays fiddle amazingly; the latter is 20sish, Julliard graduate, plays cello (random fact: was stand-partner of my current cello teacher at Julliard...weird) - they played these amazing Scottish/Celtic folk songs, jigs, laments, you name it...they were SO good. I can't stop listening to their CD which I spent all my cash (had to go down to quarters haha) to buy... I've also seen a few free concerts at Sage Hall here which my cello teacher was in. One was just him (and sometimes a piano) and it was very, very good. The second was a big group of Acadia musicians playing Baroque Bach and Vivaldi...it's not really my favorite genre of music but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Lesson tomorrow! And orchestra for almost three hours tomorrow night! Yay! I actually really look forward to both every week haha. I'M SO COOL YOU KNOW YOU'RE JEALOUS!<br /><br />Any ways...will post more at some point. I need to shower and so some homework due Wednesday and type two papers of varying lengths due Friday for two classes *slaps forehead* and so on and so forth. Sorry this was so long. A lot more has been going on of course...call me! I don't know everyone's land line number now. Any one else going home for Columbus Day weekend? What about the one after? I'll be home for both. Let me know what's going on! <br /><br />Maire</div>"

"event","Less than a week away...I'm starting to think that the first-year move-in day was chosen specifically so members of the class of 2011 can say ""See you next Tuesday"" to each other. Honestly...how rude... XD Haven't started packing yet...may need to invest in some space bags to get all my crap there... We have done some heavy-duty shopping but are still missing several key things. Like a rug, a lamp, a printer, and a box of Cheerios for the road. I NEED MY FUCKING CHEERIOS.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Masochism, *actions*, and a couple of tra, la, la's..."">Any ways, the anxiety and excitement are pretty much in equal balance these days. I've been distracting myself still with reruns of The Nanny on YouTube. Very humorous and effective at taking my mind off of slightly more stressful things. My mother keeps slipping up and referring to college as ""camp"". No ma, it's slightly more permanent than band camp. My last cello lesson is on Monday night. I still can't believe that at Smith you have to audition to take lessons (probably just for placement, but still) and it costs $600 for thirteen lessons if you're not a music major. Oi vey. I think I may sell some blood to finance this upcoming school year. Bah. I don't need it. My blood that is. A good education is much more important, right? Right. Absolument.<br /><br />In preparation for Tuesday, I got the back-to-school hair-cut, aka another perm that you can't really tell I have and a trim. Joy. Two hours getting high off of chemicals which also dripped into my ears...and the smell lingers on aaahhh. *inhales deeply* ....*faints* I've also been downloading the necessary programs onto my laptop, fearing I'll accidentally download a virus with each one, of course *rolls eyes* Well, what can you expect? I tried to download something for XP into my Vista system which shut it down the first night I owned it. Go me! *slaps self* Ok, enough masochism... for now.<br /><br />Highlights of the past week: I've been doing a lot of walking, a gay boy said my outfit was ""phenomenal,"" Lena, Connie, and I for real finally watched ""The Red Violin,"" The aforementioned twins and myself went to a somewhat rowdy town meeting in the new Taj Mahal, I mean, High School, and four days (not counting today) and a wake-up until I go out to Noho! *squee* OH YEA aaannnd my cat has thrown up on so many of the blankets on my bed that they're all now freshly laundered and ready for school! I guess she just wanted to help me in my preparation, how thoughtful of her! *scampers away*<br />&nbsp;<br />Odds are that if I have your address now, I'll be writing you letters, sealed in my own way, of course (still need to find a way to do that). If you'd like letters and I don't know your new mailing address, e-mail it to me or tell me on facebook or something. It's always nice to get that kind of mail. At least I think so :D <br /><br />This entry was pointless. I'm sorry if you actually read it. I'm sorry that I wrote it to be this way. I'm just plain sorry! *throws money at everyone's feet and runs away screaming* Wow, I've used a lot of *actions* in this entry...<br /><br />-maire<br /><br />ps. Sean Astin is SUCH a dad....</div>"

"event","Home, at last, from the worst trip I've ever experienced to Illinois.&nbsp;I spent today organizing my college papers (they are getting to be quite numerous) and checking all of my neglected internet connections (also getting to be quite numerous). I unpacked a bit last night, looked at old photo albums today, and went for a walk. OH WHAT A WALK. Ninety minutes in the early evening to myself to think and reflect on so many things. In theory.&nbsp;At least, that's how it went quite pleasantly for the first twenty or so minutes.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Illinois, Books, and the (Immaturely Excessive) Enigma that is the Male Ego..."">After that, I got the first call of the night. A group of guys zooming by combined their mob mentality, third grade vocabulary, and, of course, cunning wit and charm to quite literally <em>scream </em>""dyke"" at me. Thus, my concentration was broken, and the fuming began. I know it would probably be best to just ignore them and pretend they don't exist (believe me, I tried) but it just irritated me so much. Gentlemen, do you really have nothing better to do when driving down South Street than scream obscenities at people walking by themselves? Don't expect a tip from me when you're pumping gas into my car three years from now. *grumbles* Eventually, I got back to my original state of mind and continued somewhat calmly....until I turned around and began walking home.&nbsp;This included walking by a group of sweaty farmhands stacking bales of hay in a field and, once again, literally screaming god knows what at me until I walked around the bend (it felt like forever). So the last ten minutes walking home were ruined. I hate that that kind of thing gets to me, but it's just so completely unnecessary and immature and idiotic and I could go on forever about it. Of course, I'm taking it much more personally than I should, but I can't help it. Solitary walks for me are meant to be solitary. Instead they are <em>always</em> intruded&nbsp;upon in some form by men acting like they're thirteen and in heat. Does someone need to be neutered? Give me a moment to fetch my pliars.&nbsp;<br /><br />Moving on. The dreaded (and rightly so) trip to the Midwest. Just about every aspect was a nightmare. I don't mean to sound whiny, just stating solid unfortunate facts here: 1) It was 100* daily (WITH HUMIDITY) making any kind of outside excursion impossible. 2) My grandfather is at the stage&nbsp;of Alzheimers that he's aware he's forgetting things and asks the same questions several times a day 3) My grandmother is in denial about his Alzheimers and talks over and for him and then won't stop talking 4) My uncle thinks Harry Potter teaches witchcraft 5) Cigarette smoke is the standard fragrance inside every building, especially breakfast places 6) Corn Corn Corn CORN CORN CORN <strong>EVERYWHERE</strong> 7) Internet access.....in the public library 8) So much mother/daughter time I could puke (and you know how wonderful my patience can be when stressed out)<br /><br />Did anything fun happen, you might ask? Well, let's see... I went to Dairy Queen twice. I got about as much exercise as someone who is comatose. I got my laptop on the way out and almost broke it within ten hours! I got to drive through scenic mountainous Pennsylvania for six hours longer than expected. I got a lot of reading done, considering it was only ten days. I got a debit card. I watched a lot of movies. My cousins and aunt were very funny, nice, and normal&nbsp;:D My mom's old college roommate gave me a massive Smith coffee mug (both her daughters went) more appropriate for soup. She lives in Charleston (a college town) and that was the highlight of the trip. I became an expert at strategic napping (ie. most of Ohio and the entire MassPike). It actually made me appreciate Bridgewater. I've never missed this town so much ever in my entire life. To put it in perspective: I normally drink Red Bull once a year, during the spring musicals/exam time, to supposedly help with the stress/lack of sleep/adrenaline/concentration/pulse! On this trip, I was going on two Red Bulls a day. After a while, you can't even taste how nasty they are :D<br /><br />So what's next? Work for one more week, and intensive deep-tissue cleaning of my entire room, and extensive inventory of what I own and still need (have done zero shopping thus far), and a few more books to read. OH. That reminds me.&nbsp;<br /><br />The books I read! Very interesting and diverse, let me tell you! First, I finished the 7th Harry Potter the day before the trip. Then I read (in about an hour) the graphic novel first-years must read called <em>Persepolis</em> by Marjane Satrapi. Very, very interesting. Iranian feminist (kind of) graphic novels (<em>Persepolis 2</em> is the sequel), can't say I've ever read any before. They were about her experience during the Iranian Revolution. After that I read <em>Women Without Men</em> by Shahrnush Parsipur (had to look up her name again, haha), which was a kind of Iranian feminist collection of fables, I guess? It was a bit strange, but interesting none the less. I don't really think it was my cup of tea, but it's always nice to read something unusual. After that it was 18th-century German Romantic <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> by the exceptionally cheerful Goethe. Oh wait, that book made me want to kill myself. Much like the main character! Poor disillusioned Werther. Half the book, he sounded like a Grade-A emokid and I'm <em>sure</em> I missed any kind of classical allusion, underlying meaning, or implied point Mikey HayHay would've been&nbsp;all over..&nbsp;*slaps forehead* After that I read <em>Persepolis</em> again (by now we were driving home, it took about forty minutes to read any way, and it was refreshing after Werther) and then a very, very intriguing book my mother's former roommate bought me, literally, the instant I told her I hadn't read it (we were in a bookstore). It's called <em>Ishmael</em> by Daniel Quinn, and it's about a man who learns to think differently about the assumptions of humans throughout the history of mankind and the world, why the world exists, why humans are the dominant specie, how religion is really mythology, what separates First World humans from Third World, what knowledge is and why humans are the dominant specie for possessing certain specific knowledge, and all kinds of other fascinating things from no less than an aged yet learned telepathic gorilla, the aptly named Ishmael. It was very good and I plan to read it again sometime in the near future, to pick up all the stuff I'm sure I missed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, Mary's Book Corner is closed for the evening. I need to begin the deep-tissue cleansing of my room. Last week of work then party-hardy til the 7am on the 28th when I leave for *gasp* college!.......?!?!?!?!?&nbsp;<br /><br />-Mary</div>"

I. Hate. Life. This is painful. It's like the horrors of Driver's Ed multiplied to infinity plus ten. I just had to rant to something, sadly it's my livejournal, before facing the evil that is mandatory alcohol education.&nbsp;<br /><br />Apart from that, what else is going on? I registered to vote, thanks to Lena and Connie's dad. But unfortunately, my registration wasn't ten days before last night's election at BSC so I couldn't vote, even though Lena helped me get in with her stamped hand. No one noticed&nbsp;the backwards&nbsp;7 on the wrong hand, although the lady sitting next to me was asking awkward questions. Noob. Go home. Boo you. Town politics amuse and irritate me. The vote passed though, just barely, but I guess this town isn't completely stupid yet. Coming back for breaks should be interesting.<br /><br />I've been doing much in the way of preparation for school, which starts a month from now. Holy shit. Any ways. Less than a month, actually. Any ways, again. I ordered a laptop today&nbsp;with a school package that includes a four-year no-questions-asked (sketchy!) on-site insurance/repair policy thing, a snazzy carrying bag which will alternate as a backpack/purse, (we shall henceforth refer to it as a ""burse""), all kinds of up-to-date software, and (best part) I get to pick it up Friday on my way out to good old Illinois *shudders*. Still. That's a lot sooner than ordering it and having it shipped to my house. No shipping charges! And the computer store man (his name is Michael and he has a son in culinary school in New Orleans who, apparently, had a need for knives more expensive than my notebook...all this according to my mom, who spoke with the aforementioned computer man over the phone today when we were supposed to be working) can show us while there how everything works and compliment me on my stylish choice of burse. What a lovely fellow.<br /><br />This AlcoholEdu is one of many things I have/had left to do, including Preorientation fact sheets, a survey about illegally downloading music, I still have to make a mock-schedule before Friday, and finishing the last two hours of this godamn thing. UGH. Torture. At least I found out my rooming assignment today! Woot Parsons House! I get a room at the end of a hall...it's a corner room with, that's right, THREE WINDOWS!! And on the floor map, no lie, it looks slightly bigger than the other rooms. Unfortunately, it is two entire hallways away from any kind of bathroom. And across the campus from the music halls/gymnasium. Fuck. Oh well. My roommates name is Nora. I think. Cool beans.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok. Enough dawdling. Off to make tea. Must resist urge to continue reading Deathly Hallows (I almost peed my pants again reading Malfoy Manor ...and I already know what happens...) and check my Smith email just because I remember my password now.&nbsp;<br />Leave lovely comments, if you like. I shall try to access them from the cornfield to which I am headed at the end of the week and will probably be online tomorrow while at work, because there is nothing better to do there.

"event","I'm 18 as of eight hours and twenty-four minutes ago. I don't feel any different. That seems to happen every year.&nbsp; Why do we even celebrate birthdays? Why do people congratulate us because this was the day our mothers' popped us out? Shouldn't they&nbsp;congratulate her? Then I realized, in my fantastically cynical way, that&nbsp;we celebrate birthdays&nbsp;because we haven't died yet, and that's good. Good for you. You're still around to eat cake. I mean, honestly. So this is what I figure. Death is one of the those inevitable things that&nbsp;could happen at any time. So saying&nbsp;""Happy Birthday! You're 18! Congratulations!"" is like saying ""You've avoided dying somehow for a whole year again! Congratulations!"" At least, that's how I perceive it. And it's true, as well. I'm not dead! I don't plan to die any time soon, so why not give me a pat on the back? Thank you. I know I'm still alive and made it this far. Very courteous of you to acknowledge my survival skills. Try some punch, it's fantastic.<br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Ramblings and, of course, more Harry Potter (stop rolling your eyes at me!)"">I believe this week has been declared ""Global Harry Potter Week."" Which is nice. And even if it hasn't, when I refer to it as such in the future, you'll know what I mean. I still need to get to the movies again and watch Dan Radcliffe be possessed (favorite part! I know...it's weird) and now I don't have the midnight curfew, which is a tremendous relief. I hated that legal curfew so much. Popping in to see friends and having to leave five minutes later to get home before my insurance stops covering me...But I digress. And of course, Saturday is The Day of All Days to be a rabid HP fan. Technically Friday night :D which I've only been waiting for since I was ten. No biggy. I just thought to myself that time-span covers all of middle and high school, which is eight years, which is a bit disconcerting...that seems like an awfully long time. When did we get so old? Ah yes, it is my birthday. I've survived this long. Good for me. *pats self on back* So on Saturday, the date of the next and last HP release, such a date it was proven that juvenile delinquency drops in America significantly as everyone is at the bookstore, I shall be holed up in my room, reading, reading, reading. So it goes.<br /><br />What more is there to waste your time with? Hugs to the people who actually really read this, I try to keep it somewhat interesting, but I can't make any promises, you know. SUMMER JOB! YAAAAYYY. :-| It's just making me realize what I don't want to do with my life. I think I'd like a job that helps people directly, somehow. Not teaching, persay, since I don't like kids. 18 years old and I'm still fighting those maternal instincts. I don't not like kids, but I'm not drooling and fawning over them either...it's a kind of begrudging friendship, I suppose. Any ways, I'd like to do something where I can interact with new people,&nbsp;in a building that has windows, preferably, and&nbsp;where my mother doesn't work, and where I can maybe get out from behind a desk from time to time. I feel like a caged animal when I go into work and claustrophobia is my new best friend *twitch*. &nbsp;After reading The Shining, I'm almost hoping the place is haunted so something interesting can happen.&nbsp;<br /><br />I feel like an old, old, old woman. Sleeping and watching movies while cross-stitching have become frequent pastimes. It doesn't get much more awesome than that. I've just finished LotR 2 and must start 3 soon. The x-stitching is coming along, albeit very slowly. It's therapeutic and feels rewarding. It's going to take a long time to finish the massive one I've started.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cello practises are hopefully going to be more regular. Usually I get very focused in the weeks leading up to any audition. This one, for the Smith Orchestra/Wind Ensemble, is in the first week of September. I'm playing my Klengel piece (the one I played for the Prism Concert, minus a&nbsp;piano accompaniment) if you really cared to know. On the side, I'm now learning this fantastic Brahms Cello Concerto that I absolutely love and ordered the music for a few years ago on a whim. Now I'm learning it. I really recommend giving it a listen, even if you don't like classical music. It's ten minutes of celloey-goodness that your doctors should recommend. I feel like I'm becoming repetative. Oh no!<br /><br />In order to avoid dragging this rather boring entry on and hopefully wrapping up nicely before they get out the cane to drag me off-stage, I would like to thank my parents, my friends, my manager, my agent, my make-up artist, the key grip boy, that lighting specialist, and, of course, the Academy.

"event","I survived the dreaded family vacation, as you can read. Colorado was very different from what I expected, mainly because I had no idea what to expect. My dad accidentally bought first class tickets so we had prime seats/food/warmed towels/booze all the way from Boston to Chicago, and then Chicago to Denver. The Denver Airport resembles a mass of enormous teepees, although I think it is supposed to resemble the Rockies. You might have to squint to see it...<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Colorado and Harry Potter...what more could you want?"">Half-brother Ben got married to Maria from Mexico on Saturday. Half the people in attendance spoke Spanish and the only bits I could understand were the negative commands being barked at the kids (and there were many, kids, that is). So, if I ever find myself in a Spanish-speaking country and someone happens to shout ""Don't feed that to the dog!"" ""Close the door!"" ""Open the door!"" ""Stop running!"" or ""No!"" in my general direction, the odds of my comprehending are far greater than before the wedding. So there's that. Maria is pregnant, but it hardly shows, she's so petite. Her dress was poofy, and from David's Bridal.&nbsp;Some of the Mexican familia members wore 1940's gangsta zoot suits (complete with floor-length hip chains!). The photographer was cute,&nbsp;although his&nbsp;eye was bruised from a bar-fight the night before. Classy. My whorish red pumps were a hit, although I'm sure&nbsp;they caused permanent damage to my calves. Oh well. The price we pay for fashion, I suppose.&nbsp;<br />So, the Rocky Mountains. That wasn't much of a segway, I&nbsp;apologize if the abruptness offended your sensitive nature. Fucking terrifying and very rocky indeed. The fam., Nicole, and I, in our spiffy white rental SUV, drove through the Rocky Mountain National Park via Trail Ridge Road, the oldest highest operating highway in American history. I. Thought. We. Were. Going. To. Die. Point taken? It was all in good fun though. Every vantage point was a Kodak moment, hence why my freshly charged camera with 800 pictures still to go ran out of batteries and almost out of pictures. There was just so much to look at. It hurt my eyes a bit, actually. Television doesn't do it justice, by a long-shot. There were gorgeous snow-capped mountains, deep valleys, lakes along mountain sides created by summer run-offs, pine trees everywhere, swerving, dangerous roads with no gaurd rails and thousand-feet drops two feet away. Exhilerating, really. The entire area commanded respect. Even from the distance, where the mountains made up only the horizon instead of every speck of your eyesight, they commanded respect. We reached the summit. It was above the tree line and tundra. The plants up there take hundreds of years to grow (this I discovered after I'd picked a couple...oops), there was next to no oxygen, and it was cold. And there was always the constant fear of slipping and plummeting 13,000 feet to your death. Apart from that, it was great fun. Driving down was great too, because there was the constant fear of the brakes going out and cruising down the windy roads at the brisk speed of 80 mph. Rough area to live in. Exciting to visit. There was no humidity! Some of the best hair days of my life, I tell you.<br />The Stanley Hotel. And another awesome segway. The building in Boulder where Stephen King wrote and based The Shining. The TV movie was filmed there. We got many-a souvineer there, most Shining-related, and also ate at the hotel restaurant, Cascades. In one meal I consumed Elk, Bison, and Wild Boar. I mean, where else would I be able to eat that stuff? It was pretty good, although we had seen one elk before arriving for lunch. I hope I didn't eat it. I don't think I did.&nbsp;<br /><br />But you never know.<br />Denver was alright to walk around in. Very hot though, even without the humidity. So my hair looked great, but since it was 105*, I still felt like I was dying. Mary + Heat = Not-So-Spontaneous Combustion. If you get my drift.&nbsp;<br />Flying back = storms in Chicago = we had to land in Milwaukee first at the most ghetto airport I've ever been to. The locals drove their vans to the outer fence and stood there, staring at our large plane and waving. It frightened more than amused me, and reinforced my notion of never moving to Wisconsin. We got into Boston around midnight, cruising through some lightening, always fun.<br />Harry. Fucking. Potter. Need I say more? As of now, I've seen it twice. The midnight showing (my first!) and then this evening. So worth it. Will definitely be seeing it again. Many more times, I predict. I mean, how long have we been waiting? And now the seventh book is coming out...and I will have nothing else to live for. Just kidding. It is sad though. Considering our age group has grown up so precisely in time with the age group in the books. It's like it has always been a constant thing since fifth grade when I first read the first book. After the seventh, there won't be anything left to wonder, although I did hear a rumor that things don't end as tidily as most people would like. There is an epilogue, but like that frigging Veil (you know which one I'm talking about), it will always remain somewhat ambiguous.<br /><br />Any thoughts on the fifth movie compared to the book? I love hxc HP discussions XD<br />Maire<br /></div>"

"event","I believe this is my third or fourth stab at a Livejournal. The only reason I've picked up the knife of electronic publicized journalism and started stabbing again is because I seem to be having a massive writer's block with my actual pen-and-ink journal. With paper and everything. And so, since I'm going nuts sitting around doing nothing all day, I figured, in my own twisted kind of way, that sitting infront of my computer all day at least pretending I'm being productive is, in fact, a bit more productive. Have I lost you yet? Fantastic.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I hope you like lengthy dribbles..."">So how has life changed since graduating from high school? I've finally adjusted to not having anything due...at all...at any distant point in the near future. To be quite honest, that was what took the most to get used to. Not having homework. Not having something to do and pass in. I miss seeing my friends everyday in the same place. It's a luxury I suppose we all took for granted. I say this because many of the people I hung out with everyday in high school I have yet to see since graduation (apart from the bountiful grad parties which are still going strong, of course). I've not overlooked how easy it can be to just completely cease communicating with people and carry on with life as normal, or as normal as can be expected, at least.&nbsp;<br /><br />So how are we to cope with the impending possibilities of decaying friendships? Why, with facebook, of course! Why hold actual conversations face to face when you can poke one another instead? It saves time, energy, and money! It's probably healthier as well. If you were to actually poke someone that much, you would probably contract something nasty. Like shingles. Or worse.<br /><br />I have abstained&nbsp;from cello for several months. My hands are nice and non-muscular now, my left palm collapsing&nbsp;much too easily. Lessons have been irregular since school ended and since&nbsp;I basically stopped caring. It's one of those things that, when I'm doing it, I love it and don't want to stop and am full of positive ""I'm going to practice everyday"" thoughts. Then, when I pack it up, it becomes this big looming nuisance in the corner of my room, and suddenly it's much too much effort to&nbsp;undo seven clasps, rosin a bow, set up a music stand and&nbsp;chair, and focus. It's one of those things I suppose I shall just have to truck on through.<br /><br />This&nbsp;is why I need to get over my writer's block. If anyone is reading this, they probably&nbsp;got bored and switched to facebook ten sentences ago. For those lucky few who didn't, I hope you enjoyed the ramblings of my sleep-deprived brain. I'll try to write something of consequence next time. Who am I kidding?&nbsp;This is my poor excuse for a journal and I shall dribble as I please about nothing in particular for fifty paragraphs if I like.&nbsp;<br /><br />And now that I've debated the substance of my ""journal"" with no one in particular, I shall ask no one in particular some optional questions which they may or may not be quizzed on at a later date.<br />1) How's your&nbsp;summer going? Are you doing what you'd planned?<br />2) What's your favorite book/movie/music?<br />3) Will you donate $7 to sponsor me flying around the world in a hot air balloon?<br /><br />&nbsp;Maire</div>"

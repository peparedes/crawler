"event","1. (about 3 weeks ago)
People from various stages in my life all seem to be living together in a Coronation street style, red brick terraced house. I enter, screaming Cassandra- like that the world is about to end. People roll eyes/laugh/tell me to shut up. We join a gathering crowd outside and meteors fall form the sky.Its quite pretty. Cut to smouldering ruins of earth, i am sitting on top of a hill with someone, (Kath? Hestia?)watching survivors loot and pillage and we come to the conclusion that it is not the huge burning rocks from the sky that will ultimately be our ruin but the greed of the remaining people.

2.(about a week ago)
This time, everyone knows the world is ending, we are being herded into two groups, the saved and the unsaved, though nobody knows which is which. I am queuing at a chip shop trying to buy cigarettes for my last night on earth (priorities emily?)i follow people into a house and someone tells me that all the exits have been blocked by rocks. It seems I am with the unsaved. We have a party

3.(last night)
A more familiar scenario. I am watching earth explode from somewhere in space. This time nobody is with me. I dont seem to mind this however. I am quite looking forward to spending some time alone.

Conclusion: 
a)always have cigarettes in case the world is about to end. 
b) When I tell you its about to happen people. believe me."

Making better friends with the best and best friends with the new and harassing the old with phonecalls of love and excitement and wanting hugs all the fucking time!
Monday was about driving and sleeping and french toast and pizza and spaced and hysteria and love and love and love
Tuesday was about going to the place where i laugh the most to make sure I don't cry 
Wednesday was ALL about being incredible...(I never look back dahling, it distracts form the now)the birth of the art chefs and the drinkin of the ginger wine
Thursday was about the worst driving lesson ever and hitting the curb 4 times and going to the library and getting nothing done and getting annoyed because my card STILL has 'issues' and then getting wonderfully and horrifically drunk on tequila cocktails with all the good people and eating cheese on toast and passing out and being relieved actually becuase its probably better this way anyway.
Friday was reading about Ana Mendieta and wanting to be a land/body performance artist and loving my degree so so much! And getting really stoned, old school style and making chicken pie and watching tv for 4 hours and giggling like it was the best bits of first year again and watching secretary (which makes worms unbearably sexy) and thinking its the best love story i know and hugs and goodbyes and goodnights and goodnights

Yep. That is how Primrose Hill makes me feel.

Don't you LOVE it when you're enjoying a book so much that even when you've got off the tube at your stop you just have to sit on the platform and finish it, and you know that everyone thinks you look like a freak but it really really just doesn't matter?

(ps. Thank you ALOT to the various people who prompted me to download some Godspeed, its creeping up on me in that sneaky way music does sometimes when all of a sudden you realise you're not listening to anything else ever...)"

I really hate the phrase ""oh..she wouldn't do a thing like that.."" Surely, anything is something that anyone might do given the right circumstances?"

"event","Things I shouldn't do but do anyway and endeavour to stop doing in the future:

1.smoke from nerves or boredom and not because I really want a cigarette 
2.fancy my friends' boyfriends/girlfriends
3.fancy really quite elderly actors like Alan Rickman and Jean Reno
4.Read historical romances - a weakness that must not be indulged lest I am to descend even further into the realms of fantasy never EVER to return
5.watch pretty woman so much that I start to believe that prostitution is in fact quite glamorous
6.Meta-organistaion. Like making to-do lists that say things like ""do yesterday's to-do list""
7.buy brooches. I never bloody wear them."

"event","Oh Good lord been having far too much fun of late. Excess joy some might say. Spent a delightful few days in Brighton eating fajitas and drinking Tequila, buying cheap cds and second hand clothes,dancing with queens, sitting by the sea and generally falling in love with everything and everyone in the whole damn place. Which was nice. From there to a last minute but most enjoyable evening in Camberwell with a bunch of good good people, the rediscovery of lights alive and much Tim-Tam based fun...followed by a wonderfully confusing afternoon/evening of mushroom eating, tree climbing and sky staring on Hampstead Heath complete with brie, tomato and haribo picnic.Oh! I need to lie down xx"

I can't remember - is it that only really boring people are capable of being bored or is it that really boring people are too boring to comprehend the concept of boredom? Either way, I am fucking bored."

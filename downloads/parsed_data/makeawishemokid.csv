"event","Dear people who care about me,

ya know...
   
   all this time I'v been so focused on what I don't have.

  I have a hard time getting used to change,
but since I wrote that last entire, things have really been turning around for me,

 sometime I swear I can be soo pitiful. 
I havn't lost my friends at all, although they might not be around as much, they are always around. 
& even without that I have made a bunch of new friends that I can count on too, & I have also became closer with some people, who last year were just acquaintances.

okay so to all of my friends, thank you for making an effort to show me that I am still your friend & you havn't forgotten me

& to all my new friends, thank you for everything 


for those of you who knew me last year & the year before that, I always wonder if you have seen what a turn around I have done. I went from being the EMOEST kid in the world to what feels like the happiest one. some say that they got along better with me when i was all emo, but back then I def. wasn't happy. there was always stress & drama, back then I starved for attention & I lost alot of everything. everytime just one of my friends were mad at me, they all were, I lowered my standards sooooooo much & I'm finally seeing how ridiculous that was, & pretty much all of it was for a boy.

in the past two years, I have..really found God, had awesome friends, mended old friendships, fell in love, I'v found what I'm looking for in life & I'm HAPPY! I have goal & priorities & all I'm doing is living life & just having fun with it.

I love the person I have become. I love how I treat people & myself. I mean of course there is always room for improvemtent but form what i was, to what i am is amazing, I think.

I think the major reason I'v decided to write this besides my friends makeing me realize I'm not alone, is because of my family, for example, I look at my sister & she is acting JUST like I used to, she is soooo starved of attention & lowering her standards for a guy & It really makes me sad, & now I really understand why all of my friends turned there back on me at one point, & honestly I don't really blame you, when I try to help my sister it's like talking to a wall, it seems hopeless, like she'll never learn so most of the time i just give up.  
now don't get me wrong, not all of my friends turned their backs on my & to those people I thank you SSOOOOOO very much. but most did & thats okay too, i'm just not going to thank you. lol.

but honestly,
   all of my friends. I wish you all the best of luck in the world & years to come & I hope we will always be friends. I love you all with all my heart. & thank you for everything!

Love, 
   Erika"

It's not PMS.
& I have no reason to be mad, it's just  like everone seems to be getting on my nerves.

I keep putting myself down & acting all EMO & I hate it.

I'm really worried about everyone. In my family & my friends. 

& I keep feeling like everyone is leaving me. idk everything feels soo distance. 

since highschool started everything has changed. 

the friends i had in 8th gared arn't really my friends anymore.

3 that bother me extremly badly is Kayla H., Brittany Bennett, & Alex Bogaert.
Kayla just seems like she's gotten too cool for me.
Brittany makes me feel worthless, like she has no time for people like me.
& Alex, idk i LOVE her with all my hreart. i love all of them with all my heart but everytime me & Alex talk about hanging out it just never happens.

I know that throughout my life I have mad ALOT of wrong choices, expecally regarding my friends, but throughout these experiences I have learned wrong from right & what to do & what not to do. & it's starting to seem like people won't give me another chance for me to prove that i'v changed.

lately I'v been feeling like I can't do anything right. & I know thats not true. but at the end of the day, no matter how good the hours before were, I always end up feeling like crap.

idk. maybe I just need someone to talk to.

I need to get out of this house & off of this computer.

I'm not used to change & everything has just changed so fast.
I wish everything was how it used to be. 
I miss feeling content.

If you think you could help me possibly. please reply.

All My L&hearts;Ve & Good Night,
                 Erika"

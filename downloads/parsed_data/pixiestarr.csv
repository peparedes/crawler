"event","We have purchased our christmas tree - a 7-footer from WalMart.  Tbh, its a pretty awesome lil' tree.. we went live this year and we have lots of ornaments to put up.  No lights (how'd that happen? haha) but definitely have ornaments.

I am pretty freaking excited.  I haven't had a ""second Christmas"" with someone in a long time so this is nice!

"event","I was quite happy Obama got voted in.  As a matter of fact, I was holding back tears.  

Soon after McCain gave his speech, I sent out my ""Tonight I am proud to be an American "" text  - most responses mirrored my sentiments, those who did not were challenging & some downright aggressive.

Here are my thoughts:  Regardless of people's opinions as to why he shoudn't be allowed to be our President ranging from ""He's Muslim"", ""He's too liberal"" or ""He's not even an American [unable to produce a birth certificate]"" ~ he is our president for the next 4 years at least.  He will be the one commandeering this nation into whatever his plans are for us.  So for those of you who are upset & pissed off that he is our President, short of moving to another country, you are stuck with him.  I don't think its fair to crucify him before he even has a chance to do anything with us.  He is picking up Bush's pieces and trying to make something of it.  IMO, he can't possibly do a worse job than Bush.  



To President Obama, 

You have been given an extraordinary chance to do something to the world that we have obviously been missing.  Even though you may regurgitate old moves of presidents past, it will a different impact on this nation than ever before.  You have changed history forever.  You are our first black President.  I am proud of this fact.  I have hope for our nation more than ever before.  Like others have said, please please Mr. President, don't let us down.  You are only human I know but please remember, a lot of people voted this year who haven't before because of you.  Please do something great with the power you have.  I have faith in you, sir.

Yesterday was my first day, yeah I bent the rules & I felt like crap afterward so today I stuck to it hardcore.

<b><font color= 7FFF00>On Sept 7th</b></font>, I ate:
I took a B-12 tablet [1000mcg] to boost my metabolism.

<font color= 7FFF00>Breakfast/Lunch:</font>  1/2 cup of LivActive Mixed Berry Cereal - no milk.
                  1 slice of whole wheat toast, lightly buttered.  (no high fructose corn syrup)
                  1 strawberry-banana yogurt.
    
<font color= 7FFF00>Snack:</font>  1 small Dairy Queen ice cream cone, no toppings or anything. 

<font color= 7FFF00>Dinner:</font>  1 chicken breast, grilled on the George Foreman.
         About 3 tablespoons of Lipton Creamy Garlic Shells.
         1 slice Sarah Lee Honey White Wheat bread, lightly buttered.

The what-was-I-thinking-part?: 2 thinner slices Papa John's pepperoni pizza.  :o(

<b><font color= 00FFFF>Today (Sept 8th)</b></font> I ate:
I also took that B-12 tablet today.

<font color= 00FFFF>Breakfast/Lunch:</font>  3/4 cup of LivActive Mixed Berry Cereal - no milk.
            3/4 slice of whole wheat bread, lightly buttered.

I ate that over about 3 hours, just snacking while at work.

<font color= 00FFFF>Dinner</font>:  2 grilled Chicken Tenderloins
         1 cup mixed veggies - brocolli & carrots with some garlic something over it.

Tomorrow I already have lunch planned.  I am having the other 2 tenderloins & about 3 tablespoons of those Lipton noodles again.  I have the option of applesauce or yogurt for my snack.

We'll see how it goes."

I have been given two kittens - a brother & sister pair - to rehome. <br><br> They look very Siamese-like.

I only haven't fixed them bc I can only afford to get it dont at the Humane Society and I have personal beliefs <i>against</i> getting them fixed there.  I prefer a vet myself but cannot afford $250+ for kittens I am not able to keep.<br><br>Also I will only rehome them together - they are dependent on eachother and cannot justify seperating them!!<br><br><b> If you are interested, please email me at rspacal@gmail.com or call me at 407-716-5332 - leave me a message!</b>  I need them re-homed by the first week of November.."

In Buddhism, there are Four Noble Truths: (1) Life is suffering. (2) All suffering is caused by ignorance of the nature of reality and the craving, attachment, and grasping that result from such ignorance. (3) Suffering can be ended by overcoming ignorance and attachment. (4) The path to the suppression of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right-mindedness, and right contemplation. These eight are usually divided into three categories that base the Buddhist faith: morality, wisdom, and samadhi, or concentration. In Buddhism, there is no hierarchy, nor caste system; the Buddha taught that one's spiritual worth is not based on birth.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='96' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>96%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='71' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>71%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='54' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>54%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='54' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>54%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='17' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>17%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='17' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>17%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

"event","I lost most of my hard drive this weekend.  Along with that my ""Favorites"" went bye-bye.  So here I am asking for help to find some of the games I lost.

one was a globe in the middle and its a strategy game .. you have to place various parts on the globe and with each item you place, you can earn one-ups on the already placed items.  some of the items you have to place are a satellite, a plate, a boombox, i think some mountains, a box that turns into a robot ... a propeller (like a wind-energy fan) ... and it has a very simple design, lots of bright colors and the same 10 or so items to place.

the other one was like a tetris-style puzzle game but you had to shift blocks around to create parts of a city as instructed.  maybe called like metropolis ot tetroplois or something.  the screen always starts out the same, with a like 10 by 10 block base and there are blocks stacked and you have to rearrange them to create like ""city hall"" or ""sidewalk"".  very basic design with passwords after each level.

and one other ... you have a circle with points around the outside and a bit inside with lines connecting 2 points. you have to arrange all the points so there are no over=lapping lines.  sorta like a glorified geometry puzzle.

PS all these games were found on the 'net, mostly thru LJ links in other people's journals.
Any links or downloads?? hit me up at simplypixie@gmail.com 

Thanks ahead of time!!"

"event","So about 2 weeks ago I had a dream where I was shopping for car seats/carriers for a newborn.  Last night I dreamt that I was about 12-16 weeks along and I could feel my baby from head to bum because they were curled up right against my stomach.  I felt peaceful and anticipated the rest of my pregnancy so I could see what nature blessed me with.

Is this a premonition of sorts?  I mean should I be looking for the ultimate mate (not necessarily a husband) ... For some reason I see myself raising a child on my own.  No bitter custody battle or anything, just solo."

I want to get married and move somewhere new. I want to buy a house and redecorate and create a inviting, comfortable, safe place to raise babies. I am ready for it .. so ready .. as it was phrased to me recently .. I want to leave a legacy. I want to make someone great by teaching them great things and great ways to think. Anyway just wanted to get this out."

"event","Again!  but this time it is much happier and easier paced! ... I have retained a lease on a super phat pad in WP  (not West Palm! LOL) with a wonderful young lady named Lisa.  She has a dog and is very anxious to move... so we found a 3/1, fenced in back yard, pet friendly, lots of open space, lots of places for plants.  I like it alot and so does she.  I already have a car load ready.  I should be able to move a second one and paint tomorrow afternoon, that is should everything go well enough.  Then by Saturday morning all I will have left to do is move my bed, big stuff and computer.  Should be easy.  If I had access to a second car now I would have already filled it up.  I am already looking into a part-time job to make some more dough to make things easier.  I am very very excited about the whole thing.  A little nerve-wracked cause the rent is higher but like I said, I am going to grab a part-time something or 'nother and make it happen!

This should be fast and easy!  Toodles, MS kiddies!  See you tomorrow .. Sleep well."

I am going to combine the responses with this entry and nothing more to be said.  I dont like the drama and cant support it by responding to it.  So thanks everyone for being nice and supportive at this crazy time.  Carry on with normal life, I have better things already happening.   

October 20th's actual post:  I was issued a request so I moved everything out of Eric's.  I am exhausted.  I need a place to live - this is temporary altho stable as long as I need it to be.  Last night was surreal as well as parts of this morning.

Need a roommate?  I am lots of fun, dependable, LOVE animals.  Have four of them.  I am sad cause my 2 kittens are without me at my friend's house.  I cried today about it.

Going to shower so I can smell good and then going to bed to work a shift I picked up tomorrow.  Night everyone!

"event","Just got home from the Miss Monster 2005 gig downtown in front of Mako's on Church St!  WTF Those boys are off the m-f'in chain LOL .... They know how to party ... The music acts before the Monsters were cool and loud.  Two of the four MM contestants were super skanks .. and the really cool one won.  Yay!  Drank some but was still recovering from last nights mix of tequila and clam chowder.  (Yech!) ... While I was there,  I received 2 marriage proposals, saw a guy whipped with a cat-of-9-tails til he bled, saw a wedding, and saw lots of people from the XL Cozumel cruise too ... And the Monsters, along with Tiffany, rocked my socks off!  hehe So anyway .. yeah I am a mother f*cking party girl ... Yeah!!!"

People aren't supposed to feel this lonely while not alone, right?

I hate it.  I don't thrive well like this.  I feel like shit.  Like I did something to deserve this.  Well you know what?  I didn't.  I will remain faithful until I am slighting my needs for yours.  Then I will tell you I am done and I will move on.

Yes, it's that serious.  It's not a threat by any means.  More that I know exactly how I react to things and what is best for me.  I moved all my stuff in here - the door goes both ways.

But before it even gets that bad.. don't you want to preserve what we have?  Show me.  Make me feel it.  Right now I feel like shit - I can feel like this all on my own - I don't need you to do it for me."

One of the coolest things about the trip was, when the porters made your beds, they left a variation of the following as a surprise .. <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/TowelLobster.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">, 
<img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/TowelSwan.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">, or 
<img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/TowelMonkey.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">.  
You never knew ""who"" you would find when you got back to your cabin.

You had the same table-mates and servers at dinnertime the whole trip.  Ours were way cool! <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/FromErin5.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  That's Boden (from South Africa, bottom center), Janice on his left, me on his right, Erin (white shirt, my right), Blaine in the back on the left (Janice's son), Jillian, Ronaldo (he was the busser and drink/bread-refiller LOL), Erica, and Tunc (from Turkey) on the back right.

When we got to Cozumel <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/Map.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">, 
our boat pulled into dock ... they don't seem nearly this big when you are <i>on</i> it.  <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/boats.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

This was this quaint little market you had to walk through to get anywhere .. <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/InCozumel.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  
We took a cab to this beach.  It seemed deserted at first but we learned later that we were at the ""clean beach"" .. Playa Azul .. <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/beach.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  
The water was quite blue and very clear!  <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/beach2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Then the last night came.  :o( ... See what we will miss when we come home?  <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/Sunset.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  
But either way, we should party it up on our last night, drink up - XL was buying!  
<img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/FromErin7.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  Every see a white girl dance?  <img src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b63/SimplyPixie/Cozumel/FromRio5.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">  Yeah LOL you ain't missin' nothin'..... </lj-cut>

And that my dears, was our trip to Cozumel.  While we were there, DnJ handed out these scavenger hunt books. If you complete them and turn them into Grace at the ""Grace's Hot A$$ Men"" contest in November, you could win a free cruise next year - they are going to Bahamas and Nassau!  We'll see, we'll see!  Can't wait!"

"event","I am quitting the pharmacy, plain and simple.  I hate it there and see no reason to make them believe I like it by continuing to go in.  So I am quitting as of this moment.

In trade, I am starting a job at Boardwalk Pizza.  I will be a cashier/server.  I will cross train right away and be ready to be on my own by next week.  I may pick up a part-time medical billing something to ensure I am making a certain amount til I feel confident in the *tips* situation til then.

As I mentioned before, I joined the company softball team - well since I was let go, I play as Eric's significant other now.  Today was my first game.  I was up to bat 3 times, I hit 3 times, and I ran 3 times.  I sorta slid-fell into 1st once, lost a chance for a point cause the guy after me got out, and the 3rd run, I got tagged out because I didnt know I was supposed to stay on 3rd til you see where a fly ball lands.  All in all, a successful game.  I didnt even think I would hit once.  So I was pretty happy.  LOL Now I have a throbbing pseudo Charlie Horse in my thigh and am off to bed.  Sweet dreams, world!"

"event","I feel bummed out today.  I am going to tell my mom finally that I got let go.  Fifth time in a 5 years.  I saw an ad on a job site for my old position.  That's gotta be good for the self esteem.  Although there is a really good chance I have an interview on Monday.  This girl I know works at the company, she put in a good word for me and she really seems to like it too.   And they may be able to match my pay.  I would be doing data entry/input order for meds.  Seems easy enough esp if they will match my pay.  We'll see. 

Anyway everything else is but doesn't the negative always feel heavier than the positive?  Bears more of an impression on your soul?  I feel a little better already.  All right I am out."

I have an idea of what I want .. like this: <b><i>http://www.daniel-andres.com/index.cfm?mid=1005&action=Portfolio</i></b>  or  <i><b>http://stealyoursoul.com/</i></b>.  I want to take pics to give to my boyfriend or hang in our house (without anyone really knowing its me).  The thing is I dont have costumes or props so I would prefer that the photographer have access to this stuff and a make up artist.  I will pay for it all.  I just want some really good photos.  Thanks everyone!  Rachel


PS I see all these teens and young adults who have these bad ass pics on their blogs and icons.  I would honestly even consider an amatuer photographer who can do stuff like that.  Just someone who is creative and has some time.  Maybe even some body paint stuff...."

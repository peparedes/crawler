"event","I realize now just how much ... useless possessions one can collect in their lifetime.  This house is full of artifacts that appear to have no apparent value.  I do not even know if they are worth anything.  The dust on them looks to be worth more than the items themselves.  It is harder now to amaze me with what people find sentimental attachment to, enough to keep it.

On a more poignant note -- I stumbled across my old clothes today.  Clothes fit for an infant boy, carefully preserved in a trunk high up in the precariously full attic.  It is a slow process, working by myself, to sort through all these things.  No one who knew her has offered any assistance on the matter.  Perhaps it is for the best.  One person alone can do less damage when staggering around the relics of the dead.

What I may need to do is look into donations for local causes.  Would the school have any use for some of these artifacts and books?  My uses for proper magic are few and far between these days.  They might be put to better use in the hands of some capable wizard.  I just made a note to investigate my alternatives.

Rumor has it that Lucius Malfoy and some Ministry peons have been burrowing their noses into my work here.  The Ministrt is probably looking for handouts as usual.  I'm not as confident on the interest of Lucius Malfoy.  Afraid I might find something incriminating?

My shop opens in a day.  There is still much work to be done if I want to be ready.  This project has escalated beyond what I predicted it would be.  I hope the effort will be worthwhile."

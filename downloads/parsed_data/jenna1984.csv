"event","Apparantly I'm a bitch. I've been hearing that alot lately albeit in a joking manner. Either I'm a bitch or a hater. Haha, it makes me laugh cause I don't think I really have much reason to hate or be a bitch. Life is good if I cared to look at the big picture. However, as a young selfish adult, I tend to look at little issues and analyze the shit out of it and than get upset for no reason. Oh, the dramatics of young adulthood...and they say being a teenager is dramatic. 

So work was fun the other night. I bonded with a girl named Brenna who happens to be a facebook whore and is one of the funniest ppl I've ever met. I think we might be twins. We spent the whole night talking shit and harassing our poor co-worker Colin. I feel for the guy even though he dumped us into club garbage twice and I was wearing a skirt. How inappropriate! 

I just wanna head back to the bitch comment because a thought just entered my head and I'm a stream of consciousness kinda girl. I like writing as the thoughts come, in no particular order. Is that what stream of consciousness even means??? We talked about this in anglais many a time and I have somehow managed to NOT process it. Grrr. So back to my thought...I've been called a bitch and I guess I can act like one sometimes but like I said, it's an act. I actually think I'm one of the friendliest most caring people I know. I'm a bit of a push over and I always keep my word if I make a promise. I on the other hand feel like people treat me like crap sometimes. Despite my efforts, I always feel like I do far more for my friends than they do for me. I'm beginning to feel as if some of my so called ""friends"" use me and call me when there is no one else to call. This goes wayyyy back even to my childhood where I spent so much time and effort to get my friends nice gifts for gift exchanges only to recieve absolute shit in return. I know it's the thought that counts but that kinda thing can only happen so many times before you get angry. So yeah, I'm being fucking used like a frying pan when making stirfry!!! haha, that was funny and cheered me up periodically. 

At the same time, I also wanted to say how great my real friends are. I'm so glad I have a handful of friends who I can really lean on. 

In other news, I am procrastinating again. Nothing has gotten done this week and I want to kick myself. And I also want to go skating...weeeee....I love skating and winter activities. Clearly I have a short attention sp....oh, look a bunny! haha, I just joined a facebook club with that title. LOVES IT!"

"event","I can't sleep...

I'm finding it difficult to block out everything that is bothering me so I can finally go to sleep in peace. Ever wake up in the morning and feel like you got zero rest? That's how I feel every morning and its starting to get old. Going to class in zombie mode is not the best way to learn nor is falling asleep and hoping that you learned through osmosis. I'm tempted at times to just play hookey just because I know I'm not going to learn anything in my state.

This week is looking a little stressful. I have civic mapping due on Tuesday, story pitch due on Wed and I have to host on Friday!! Yes, I will be current affairs host on Friday afternoon and that means I will have to find some poor soul to take time out of their busy schedule just to humour me and my class. I miss TV class!! who would have thought I would EVER say that but I do. In addition, I'm supposed to meet Linda tomorrow to discuss my article and I'm mildly terrified of what she has to say. 

I need a holiday. Going to school is beginning to feel like standing for a REALLY long period of time in your most uncomfortable pair of stilleto heels and you are about to fall over but not quite yet. That's the place I'm in right now. Someone pass me a chair. 

I suggested on msn that I wanted to go skating and I got a couple responses. I had no idea why I suddenly got this urge to skate. I mean, my brand spankin new skates haven't been used in ages and I've never really felt like I absolutely HAD to go skating but right now, that's all I want to do. Maybe it has soemthing to do with the feeling you have when skating, being free to glide...being uninhibited?? Maybe its just cause we finally got our beloved lake devo back and I've been watching ppl skate. 

As for life at work, I can honestly say that I'm having fun. It's nice to have a place where you aren't looked at like you're psycho for wearing a mini denim skirt, a tank and flip flops in the dead of winter. Some people have been calling my work, THE O.C and I think its fitting. Not to the mention the view of pretty boy at the door welcoming you to Hollister with a nice smile and rock hard body!Too bad he's just a pretty face..not my style. I never thought that the day that I saw a guy that brutally hot that I would also say he wasn't my style. But he really isn't. I've come to the conclusion that as much as I like a little eye candy I tend to go for funny guys who are confident and who might not be the new face of Abercrombie and Fitch but are decent looking guys. One complaint though, I am getting pretty damn SICK of saying ""DUDES"" and ""BETTY'S""...can they not speak English in California cause last time I checked the Collins English Dictionary, Dudes and Betty's were not listed. 

On a final note, I had a nice evening out with girls Saturday night. I was beginning to feel like everytime I went out at night, it was to go to a club and you know what clubbing means...stress and bitching. We went to Epic at the Fairmont Royal York and than instead of clubbing we went to Futures for dessert and girl talk. I miss girl talk too Jen (refer to your own blog) I really needed that and it was nice to have someone ask you what was wrong when you zoned out and stared into space. I feel loved...lol. Even though we also discussed who we would shoot if we had one bullet..courtesy of Ashleigh and listened into the convo of the couple dining behind us. It was rather funny actually...""OMG, I think he's wearing true religion jeans!!!"" 

Okay, I think I'm done ranting for the evening."

"event","I just read a lanky guy from Alberta's blog and he has inspired me to update my LJ. I've come to the untimely conclusion that jounalism will be the death of me. I spent the last two weeks fretting over a Ryersonian article that I don't think is worthy to be printed. In fact, I think printing the issue with a blank page in the features section with the words ""Jennifer's article sucked too much to be printed so we'll leave this space blank"" would be of more interest to the student body than what I actually wrote. This makes me sad because only 2.5 years ago, I was sure that I would end up the managing editor of Vanity Fair or senior producer at 20/20. Instead, I'm gonna sell out and go into PR. How do ya like that Ryerson journalism??!!! 

This is part of the blog is especially for Em Ford because I promised her I'd update this journal while she was in London so she could keep up with the jskool gossip circuit. Well Em, sorry to disappoint but aside from the usual Jen F is boycrazy and Shallima likes brit bands banter we have on a daily basis nothing of interest has come up. I'll email you and tell you the dirt on my life later on. Don't want the whole world knowing about my mundane existence! lol. 

Sometimes I wish someone would develop a show about people's random conversations on the subway. I think that would be quite a success seeing as how I'm sure tons of people listen into other people's convos during the long subway rides home. Or is it just me? Once I heard two guys talking about what girls ""like"" and I don't mean flowers or chocolate. I held in my hysterical laughter until they were out of sight. Boys are such silly martians but I guess they feel the same way about us. Sometimes I don't understand my own actions so I can't blame boys when they look at me with an expression of WTF did I do???

It occured to me while I was doing the dreaded civic mapping assignment today that critical issues class is a waste of my time and essentially a let's not be racist against black people class. Okay, I think I got the jist of this in fourth grade when I learned about the Underground railroad and read a book about Rosa Park. I don't need a 60 year old white affluent male telling me not to be racist nor do I need Ashante Infantry informing me of how
awesome the black community is...I have Kanye West for that! Sadly, I have to write about how St. James town is really just like Rosedale or Forest Hill. I think I'll write in my feature, ""I took a nice stroll in the heart of St.James town at night and didn't get shot."" Hooray, see it just has a bad rep! I spoke to a young man there the other day in an effort to get him to defend his community and crush the stereotypes but ya know what he said? ""The cops keep hassling us for no reason...all we're doing is chillin and smokin weed...are you a cop??? 

Oh lord, the joys of journalism never end do they? I need a break for dinner with the girls."

"event","So my throat kills and currently, it hurts to swallow so I've avoided food and drink as much as possible. I'm HUNGRY now!!! Something's wrong with me I'm pretty sure. I have work to do that I just can't get myself to do!! Really, it takes a life threatening event to make me do my homework. How sad is that??? Today I spent the day vegging out and NOT doing anything. I could have gone to class but meh, I mean I think I was borderline sick today so why waste a legitimate excuse to miss class ya know? Sad, cause apparantly I missed a very lively guest speaker, Carlene Nation in Critical issues today. I just want to take a moment to thank the lord for the many guest speakers we will be having in that class cause hearing John Miller's slow monotonous yammering for the rest of the semester doesn't exactly appeal to me. 
I'm sort of in a dilemma. I have come to realize that when someone offers me a job that pays, I can't say no, no matter what job it is. For the next two weeks, I have accumulated 3 jobs. I still work at Starbucks for the next two weeks technically but I'm trying to give my shifts away to a sucker who'll take them. Good luck working with the dimwits at my location!!! I also have a new job that is gonna start officially on Thursday. AND, I agreed to work a couple days at CTV running errands and stuff during elections. I figure it will be a ""good experience"" being exposed to a journalistic environment and all that jazz. Maybe I'll sleep with someone and next thing you know, I'm the star anchor there!!! Sometimes I hate nepotism so much but you can't help but not complain when someone hooks you up with an awesome job just cause you know them. Nepotism is the way of the working world I guess. It's all about the networking, as they have so eloquently drilled into our heads at jskool. 

I'd like to have a random ADD moment: I have never realized how embarassing it is to drop a bunch of stuff on the ground and to have like 6 people help you pick up your shit. I've seen it happen to people and never though much of it. Recently, I had like a handful of change in my pocket for reasons that I don't recall and as I was walking, I tried to take it out and my hand slipped and it went crashing all over Yonge Street. Four people stopped to help me pick it up and I couldn't even look at them cause embarassment overcame me. For dropping change? That happens all the time and yet I felt rather humiliated. I dunno, thought I'd like to share that with someone...something."

"event","Sooooo...im really tired right now yet I am forcing myself not to sleep. I tend to do that alot. Tomorrow is supposed to be the first day of classes and I have come to the decision that I am not gonna bother to add my classes yet and just take the day off. I'm tired and I need one full day of rest and relaxation. So anyway, I went to Pacific mall with my cousin today and that mall is fucking crazy ass. Little obscure stores selling bootleg dvd's and a big store full of REALLY GOOD designer knockoff handbags. I saw a Christian Dior bag that I liked but ITS FAKE. I would rather buy real Guess than like effin fake Dior. I don't care if Guess is like 10 notches lower at least I didn't pay 100 dollars for a cheap replica. Continuting on my spiel, the dvd store was kinda interesting. I've never bought a pirated dvd before but I was sooo tempted to. I've been wanting to watch the original Japanese version of The Ring and it was only 5 dollars but alas, they were sold out and only had The Ring 2. Cries! Nicole, I know you would have been very proud of me watching the movie that I star in. LOL since I am Samara in your eyes. Clearly I look like a wet raven haired demon child!!!! I will come haunt you in Holland k? 
I think I have run out of stories...hmmm, that's quite sad cause that was really only one event in the million days since I updated last. Life can be boring and mundane as my life has clearly illustrated. Well I did spend some time with Julia the other day and it was a happy day even though Milestone manages to disappoint me every single time I set foot in there. Why do I pretend I like it?? I think that chocolate ibra-something or other cake is sooooo good that it overshadows all the dirt I have forced myself to ingest there and I simply feel like it's a good place cause the cake leaves a damn good last impression. I also managed to buy my beloved Guess cargos...refer to entry 1!!! The Guess man was kind enough to give me 10 percent off but he kept telling me that they were so versatile cause they could be pulled up in the summer and ta da become capris but really its just one side of the pants getting pulled up like two inches...it's still cute but last time I checked that wasn't capris. So yeah, fun times this holiday! How many days till summer again?? the countdown begins. Who wants to go to Vegas this summer?? Seriously people no joke, I fucking want to go to Las Vegas for like 4 days in May. SAVE YOUR DAMN MONEY and don't make excuses or my foot will be seeing your ass soon. 

anywho, im tired now...night muffins!"

"event","I got a livejournal!! YAY

So this is my second online journal thingamabob. I got sick of xanga after about 6 months but I'll make an attempt to stick with this for as long as I can. I thought it was the perfect opportunity to get a new journal cause it's January 1st and I'm feeling the need to vent about the past year. Also, some of my lovely friends are going on exchange and they might want to keep up with the goings on in the life of moi while they are away. Lucky bitches!!!! So there you go, all the reasons why I need a livejournal. 
I feel like I haven't had a break this holiday. Ever since I finished my last exam, I've been out and about either shopping for gifts.....for MYSELF....lol, ofcourse for others as well, seeing friends or WORKING. I can't believe I've actually lasted at my job for two months. I hate it and I dread every flippin second of it. Actually, I don't think I've ever actually enjoyed any of my jobs, and by enjoy I mean genuinely being excited to go into work. Does anyone ever have that feeling?? 
I'm gonna be really random and just end topics abruptly just cause I don't have the energy to make these entries flow nicely. I do enough of that in jskool! 
So recap of my year...well it kinda sucked. I got one really crapass grade that will stick out on my transcript for the rest of my university career. I hope employers never dig up transcripts cause they'll see this sore spot and OMG, I'll never get hired anywhere and I'll end up panhandling with my cello and working evenings at Mickey D's! School was so stressful this term, it was one notch below pure Hell. Let us never speak of economics or Marsha Barber for as long as we live or until I get her next year again in which case I will have to a)drop out of school b)hang myself. 
In other news, lol....I feel good about my little shopping spree this holiday. I got most of the things I wanted to buy so here is the list: TNA coat from Aritzia, Puma future cats, Coach wristlet, TNA long t-shirt, Mavi jeans, cropped pea coat and an Abercrombie and Fitch zip up. All those things are currently in my posession. The smaller list of things I haven't been successful in purchasing are as follows: black stilletos, khaki coloured boots, Guess cargos, some type of evening handbag, black pointy toe boots. Reading this list makes me feel like such a materialistic shopaholic but what can I do?? Curbing my spending habits is out of the question when I go to school beside a mall and work on Bloor street. Yeah, NOT gonna happen people! 
Before I end this entry I just wanted to thank all you girls for the lovely gifts and Jill for organzing our annual xmas get together. You are a muffin!!!! Someone called me that the other day and I'm stealing that pet name so you are all going to be my ""muffin's"" from now on. Happy new year!! 

Luv Jen"

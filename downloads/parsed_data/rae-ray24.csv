"event","So the other day in math, Emily and I were talking about how boring it was to grow up in the suburbs. I think growing up in the south, or in a small town, sounds really old-fashioned and kind of romantic. And growing up in the city would be really fun and you could do anything you want because it's all within four blocks of you or a train ride away. But the suburbs are boring, and everything fun is just far enough away that it has to be a whole day thing, and everything nearby is... wait, there is nothing nearby. But not in a fun way. We don't have any pretty fields or anything, nowhere to lie down and see the stars. Oh yeah, and you still can't see the stars here. And there aren't really any good sledding hills."

"event","<br />So, it's finally the second semester of my senior year. I've been waiting for this for so long. I'm so close to prom, to graduation, to this amazing summer, to college. Everything I've ever wanted. Right?<br /><br />Yeah, I've been waiting for this for a long time. But now that I'm here, I feel... nervous. Apprehensive. Kind of terrified, actually. Nostalgic. And I feel like I've changed a lot since junior high, since freshman year, but I don't think I'm the person that I thought I was going to be. I don't have this amazing boyfriend, I don't have a set date for prom, I have no idea where I want to go to college, and I don't know what I want to do this summer. My life just isn't at all the way I always pictured it. And yeah, I know that's the way it always is. I&nbsp;just... had all these plans, you know?<br />And I just feel kind of... bored. <br />And I just want to get the rest of this school year over with, but what am I going to do this summer? I really have no idea. Sure, I'll work... I&nbsp;know Claire's going to camp for two months, but I don't really know what anyone else is doing. I'm sure everyone's going somewhere on vacation, or going to art camp, or japanese camp, and I just don't have anything planned. And seriously, what am I going to do? I don't want to just be a bum. I want to have this completely amazing summer, the last time my friends and I know for sure that we'll be together before we go to college. Which is another thing (the main thing) that I'm freaking out about. But I don't just want to go to burrito station every day, go downtown, whatever. I want to go to New York, I want to spend every day at the beach. I want my life to be amazing and exciting. And I know that's not really going to happen. But I really, really want to <em>do&nbsp; </em>something this summer. I don't know, I just...<br />I need something to look forward to.<br />I just feel like this isn't enough, right now. I need something more."

"event","So I'm writing something on here for Jordan, because I'm pretty sure
she's the only one who uses livejournal still. which sucks, because I
love it. like, if you just feel like writing something for your friends,
you can post a million notes, or you can come on here. which is way
classier.

Star Trek is amazing. Kirk and Spock need to hook up. Up is also amazing.
&quot;I was hiding under your porch because I love you!&quot;

my favorite things: Summer, target, movies, burrito station, downtown,
weekends, assassin, thrifting, friends, doing nothing, the beach, the zoo
(we need to go), shopping, the bank not being dumb, our version of sorry,
swimming, polo, sleeping late, vacation, and all the rest.

Summer School Countdown: 5 weeks,&nbsp;3 days

love you!

"event","i havent writen on here much as of late.  my last post was certainly depressing.  i wrote it at a weird time.  since then, well i still dont really like my job.  im kinda looking around for something new.  but its a pain b/c ascap was one of the only things in nashville i really wanted to do.  well, it turns out that i dont want to do licensing... no, i dont want to do sales.  im just not a salesman.  i can market.  im more of a pull person than a push. 
im in little rock for memorial day weekend.  little rock is always... little rock.  i love my friends here, but i dont like the city and what it does to them.  there is too much settling.  me, im sick of settling.  if i were to stay at ascap without anyother plans, i would be settlinng for a paycheck.  thats why i need to get something else going.  id really like to get some freelance work going, something to really challenge me.  im not feeling challenged right now.  michael and i have been throwing some stuff around.  we just need to find that one idea that will stick.
i did see john, jimmie and kurt's band last night... fits and starts.  i liked it.  not what i expected... i dont mean that in a bad way, just for some reason i didnt think those guys would go towards that sound.  we will see.
well, just letting you know im alive and not quite so depressed anymore.  just bored with my work.  im certainly not bored with ashlee though.  that girl is amazing, even if she doesnt let me win... and she accuses me of cheating at putt putt (which i most certainly did not!!  i won my dirt bike fair and square!)"

"event","have i got some news.  i accepted the job at ascap.  i was sort of bugging out just b/c the timing of it all seemed kinda weird.  but i had alot of people that i really respect give me some good advice to help me make up my mind.  so thank you if you were one of those people.  i appreciate it more than you know.  and you know, if mtvU comes with an offer, then i decide about that then.  but i like being in nashville  i dont regret staying here.  i want to be here.  if God wants me to go to New York someday, He'll take me there.  but right now i feel pretty confident He likes me being here (i think ashlee likes me being here too)
so i start there next tuesday.  should be pretty awesome.  im going to have a real honest to goodness job.  with a salary and benefits and a pension plan and the whole shebang.  they are even sending me on a business trip at the end of march to atlanta.  ill be going for three days.  there is some sort of banquet ill be attending (ive chosen the salmon over the chicken or steak entrees, i hope that proves to be a wise decision)  its like all of a sudden, im gonna be a grown up or something.  weird huh?

well, its almost time for the oc, so i better go.  (yeah, i totally got hooked watching the dvd i got ashlee.  im so lame, i know... its not even on a viacom owned station, what am i thinking?!?)


ps. ashlee is so amazing... breath taking even... stunning... captivating... heavenly... God's greatest gift to mankind... and no i am not writing this b/c she wants me too... and of course i cant forget lovely


pps.  michael and i are unveiling our new name.  GIRLS AND BOYS will be bringing you the best st. patrick's day party this side of the mississippi.  $5 at the basement. 8pm until 3 spinning 80sindierockwonder, cocainesexjamz, and partytillyoupukeanthems.  be there or be a rhombus."

"event","man o man o man,
what has happened as of late?  quite a bit.
i did not get the emi job.  after cominng down to me and one other person, they decided to go with the other person.  i was really glad to get the chance though.  i know that God is leading me to the right place.  which is what im wondering about now.  i went to nyc thursday.  my supervior's position is still open, which would be great.  they are also trying to create a coordinator possition for affiliate relations, (read, my old internship as a paid position).  new york was awesome too.  it snowed, all light and fluffy.  man i love the snow.  i got to see everyone at mtvU.  i miss that place.  the new offices are pretty cool, but much more office-y, which is good and bad. they are still all great people, thats for sure.  most people were surprised to see me.  especially belle, i got to talk to her for a while.  it was great, b/c i got to see really only that side of her that is willing to admit that she is 23 and has a life outside of work.  in some ways, i want to work there if only to make sure she can stop stressing out all the time and have some more fun.
along these loose lines of a job, i was officially offered the ascap position this morning.  that is really awesome, and the answer to alot of prayers.  but in other ways, i had sort of already written this possibility off.  im just praying all day, trying to make a decision.  on the plus side, the salary is more than what they told me, id have benefits, i'd have a job, and i could stay in nashville.  and it sounds silly, but i cant really say there is a down side.  so why i didnt just accept, i dont know.  i think its is just nice to have a day to pray everything over.  and really, while it would suck to start here, then quit b/c something came up at mtvU.  but if i started here, that sort of rules out mtvU.  i just dont know.  please pray for me.  im glad that cognito group meets tonight.  i just know that God will reveal some crazy stuff there, b/c he always does.
how is it that i can complain about having great opportunities in two cities i love?  i should be thankful i have anything, let alone any sort of option.  please just pray for me guys.  and if God gives you any major revalations, please let me know.  i'll keep you updated."

"event","today is valentines, and i dont get to spend it with my darling ashlee.  im really hating virago.  at least i got to spend some time with ashlee last night.  but this week i only have tuesday off.  if i get off too late to go to the show wed night, im going to be pissed!!
but here is my plan.  im just going to start getting ripped at work.  if im drunk, then at least i should be able to tollerate working there.  AND, if i get caught, i'll get fired.  but i wont care b/c ill be durnk, and im just waiting to quit anyway.  so its a win-win-win situation as far as i see it.

so the big surprise, i know you've all been waiting with bated breath.  im up for three positions.  my first choice, artist development at EMI here in nashville.  ive already had three interviews, and its been made pretty clear that i will be offered the job.  choice two, licensing at ascap.  ive already been told i am the top candidate for the position.  they are simply waiting for the background check to go thru.  choice three, my former supervisor at mtvU has been promoted and her position is open.  i essentially already did the job for months, and belle told me that carlo and lori (the people i'd would work directly for) want my official resume, and to schedule a phone interview.  the only reason this is my third choice is because i would have to move to nyc immediately.  which would make finishing my thesis rather difficult.  but at this point i dont really care.

i think its sort of funny that i have been able to find three strong prospects.  how many belmont students just end up being bank tellers or working in retail or whatever after graduation.  and i've got three opportunities.  i'd like to believe its simply because i am so incredibly gifted, qualified, handsome, that business.  but honestly, i know its just God blessing me.  i dont really get why He never lets me trip up for more than like a few days.  ive just always had the feeling He's constantly preparing me for something... something big.  i dont know why.  again, He just pours out blessings on me again and again, i cant really look to many times that i could ever say ive had it very hard in my life.  and i certainly do my best to try and mess all that up, and He wont even let me do that.  i guess thats why i keep getting the feeling that something is coming up.  
maybe someday ill get to lose it all and live as a hobo.  that could be pretty cool.  and then i could lead the other hobos to start a militia, and i will be king hobo, with an underground mansion made of boxes and discarded wood scraps in an abandoned parking garage.  under this leadership, there will be a spike in the hobo stock market (where trading consists mainly of canded goods and shoes) that will embarass the nasdaq to no end.  and we will usher in a golden age for the hobos, and we can finally end our war with the gypsies, and unite under a flag of peace (sewn together from old underpants and a nylon banner stolen from a churches chicken drive-thru)

but there is all the good news and everything.  im going to get back to work."

what else has been going on... im still looking for a job.  a career if you will.  ive got some prospects, ill let you know.
the united states postal service can suck it!  i'm expecting to start recieving mail any day now.  its only been a month.  who knows if any of those lost packages will show up.  i just know it'd be nice to get things that ive paid for.  damn you post office!
soon, and i do mean soon.  michael and i will begin throwing the parties of three lifetimes.  nashville, get ready.  we did a practice run at our house friday... very last minute, but i think all the elements are in place.
tonight, the one and only ocean will sing itself to sleep

ps. check out audioscrobbler.com, once they have the servers up and running properly, its going to be amazing."

hopefully im going to get all my school stuff worked out today.  it would be nice if they'll just give me a diploma in may, b/c that when im going to be done done (not that im not really done done now, just that thesis... which im feeling alot better about these days, thanks for asking)
the big thing right now is i need to get a job.  i'd like to be able to take the time and get something i really want to do, which i can if i can start picking up a few nights a virago just for some regular cash flow.  i just want to make sure im not just working somewhere just to get buy.  i need to start thinking about this whole career thing.  so again, if anybody has any leads, please let me know.  b/c i know there are just hundreds of music marketing jobs out there just waiting for someone as qualified as myself.  no, its cool, im going to get on it.

"event","so i've just been kicking it here in little rock for the last couple days.  nashville was fun for the weekend.  good sausage party saturday night for nathan.  and when i say sausage party, i mean that literaly.  russ went and bought like $60 worth of sausage which we cooked up and ate.  so much tubed meat.  dave's apartment reeked.  then there was nathan and kb's wedding.  it was beautiful.  i loved her dress.  you could just tell how excited both of them were.  amazing.  im not quite yet ready for all the other stuff that goes along with being married, but having a weding sounds pretty cool.  having this public declaration of your love for this person, knowing that you want to spend the rest of your life, with them.  have children with them.  grow old with them.  man, i am so cheesy.  just saying its going to be awesome, and i cant wait.
so since tuesday ive been in little rock, where the fun never... starts.  ugh.  wednesday morning it snowed, so really since then ive been stuck in my house.  its not even like it snowed that bad, but we live on a hill, and little rock has absolutely no way to deal with clearing or salting the roads.  ugh.  ive been out for like 20 minutes the last 2 days.  other than that, its been aimlessly searching the internet, or watching the history channel (you would be amazed what you can learn watching the history channel for 2 days almost non-stop).  pretty exciting i know.  hopefully tonight there will be enough other kids w/o ""family obligations"" so we can get out and have some fun.  only problem is everything will be closed b/c its christmas eve.  its like i want to complain, but its not like there is anything real to complain about.  im just bored is all.  and since when is being bored, but safe and warm inside your house really all that bad.
well folks, have a merry christmas, and hopefully ill see you all in the near future."

this is the girl michael has had a crush on for some time this semester.  we found out only last night that she ""prefers the company of women""... needless to say, weezer's pink triangle is now a staple in our room

the girl here is ashlee (in case you didnt know by now)... she will pick me up from the airport this friday.  i miss her so.  the boy in this picture is me.  my 22nd birthday is this thursday.  send me lots of presents and money please.

this is me at sesame street.  i want to live nowhere else in the world more than i would want to live on sesame street.  i dont get starstruck, ever.  but when i met THE grover, i cound speak.  i was shaking (more than normal) i was so excited.  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!! this is a picutre of me on the steps to the the house at 123 sesame street.  then thats me, michael, and grover, just chilling out.  then thats me in oscar's trash can.  you would not believe what is down there.  he has this beautiful loft, fully decked out.  very sleek and modern.  no view, and you have to come in and out thru a trash can, but totally worth it.  and he's had it rent controlled since the 70s, so rent is super cheap.  lucky guy.

what has been happening recently?  well, i worked on a paper mostly for the first part of this week.  turned that in thursday.  then had my last two college classes... ever!  i just dont understand that at all.  i will never be taking another college class ever again.  what is really weird is that i still dont get to graduate for months.  so my whole life is now is some sort of crazy limbo.  im essentially done with school, but i dont have a diploma.  i need to start a career, but cant really b/c i need to write my thesis.  i'm going to live in nashville again in a week, and that may or may not be temporary.  now is not the time to screwing around.  this is like some crazy backdoor creep into adult life.  i would be absolutely terrified if i knew exactly what to be afraid of.

its weird that this is my last weekend in new york.  there is a startling lack of finality to it all.  i dont know what that means precisely.  i saw life aquatic of steve zissou last night.  sometimes i wish i cried at movies, especially if no one else cries.  i like knowing to know that i have such a strong feeling; the cause doesnt matter, just the end.  but there may be nothing more difficult than being stuck in the middle.  my whole life is stuck in the middle for the moment.

so anyway, this week really hasnt been a drunken haze.  mostly ive been 9 to 5ing it, getting whatever i need done.  trying to start some papers.  trying to finish others.  ugh.

right now that thing you do is on tv.  i havent seen this movie in years.  its such a great movie... but it cant help but make me think about the past.  it makes me a bit sad i must say, thinking about some of what has happened since high school.  i love my life now, i wouldnt want it any different.  i just kinda hate how somethings went down.  when i was in little rock, i hate running into people and having to go thru the whole small talk shit.  i didnt run into anyone... i guess i just need to appologize to a few people.  who knows when ill get the chance.  i dont know.  i dont really expect anything significant to happen, for any wounds to heal.  it just seems that it be the right thing to do.  but im rambling.  i can only think of two people who might read this and have any idea what im talking about.  whatever, im over it.

nathan's wedding is going to be amazing.  i cant wait.  in some ways, i feel just as excited as he is.  i dont know why.  but he is clearly soo happy.  and this will be my first reception where i know alot of the people there.  i think it will be much more enjoyable that way.
i best be getting a move on.  its go time."

"event","for whatever reason, i just woke up at 8am this morning (a saturday mind you) thinking about my thesis.  and i knew i would be able to go back to sleep until i spent a little while writing.  sometimes i think that this stupid thesis is all i think about it.  i just need it over, i just need to graduate, i just want to be done with it all.  and thats the thing, i can barely get myself to do what little school work i have now.  in most ways i feel like i mentally finished school this summer.  ugh.  i say i dont get stressed, but and thats pretty much true about little things, but im a little stressed.  i really just need for my prospectus to be well recieved next friday.
last night i walked around in the cold and the rain with elliott.  it was pretty fun despite the dreary atmosphere.  didnt really do much, just hanging out.  i feel lame that we really havent done that much this semester, being that this is the first time we've lived in the same town for like 2 years.  eventually we ended up at this total bro bar that he and katie and some king's college kids hang out at.  it was alot of fun, b/c everybody else there was pretty well gone.  usually i hate being the only sober one, but i think its all about attitude.  i was determined to have a good time, make the most of it.  and i did.  rad.
alot has happened recently i suppose.  at least it should have.  i havent written much recently.  and i know ive been busy.  trying to get papers wrapped up.  i did see jimmy eat world monday.  i love those guys... i cant say that i love their fans.  maybe im just getting old, or jaded, or both.  i just dont know.  i also had to miss interpol on thursday because of class.  lame to the maxx!  not that im the world's biggest interpol fan, but i already had a ticket and everything.  im really looking forward to wednesday and my dad coming to visit, and thanksgiving.  im just going to lie around, eat amazing food.  hang out with all the dudez and dudettes in little rock and nashville.  i get to fly (i love flying, even though im too tall for coach seating).
im out.  this boring.  i hope ashlee's drive to orlando is safe.  i really think you need to get some rest so you can get better.  just trying to look out for you."

we've done lots of fun things.  halloween day the weather was amazing.  ashlee, morgan and i walked thru the park.  im really glad ashlee and morgan hit it off so well.  i didnt realize how much they were alike until i saw them side by side.  they both make fun of me b/c im such a girl about so many things.  tomorrow we are all going to trl.  im going to jump and scream for jimmy eat world.  ive already decided.  i want to be a child... no, i am not a child, i am much younger than that.
there is something political going on tomorrow... im not really sure what.  i think its like an election or something.  just kidding.  im really just getting sick of it all, im ready for it to be over.  people have their minds made up, all for different reasons.  argueing and bickering and propaganda isnt going to change any one's minds.  at least it shouldnt.  its not hard to find out where each candidate stands.  they really just approach the same issues from very different perspectives.  who am i to say one man is right and the other wrong.  i personally agree and disagree with each of them on a number of issues.  but regardless, its not like much is really going to change.  abortion will remain legal.  we'll still have obligations in iraq.  terrorists could still strike any time they wanted.  ""protected classes"" will still cry discrimination for this, that, or the other.  the economy may change... but even that is often based more on consumer and investor confidence, which is just as easily (if not more so) swayed by the media.  whatever, im just ready for people to stop drawing such battle lines.  ive never been much for team loyalty i suppose.
i know i should have more school work.  i wish i would hear back about my thesis proposal.  i need it approved soon, but ive heard nothing from dr. boan.  argh!  i just want to graduate, and start making more money than im spending.  im on a slippery slope there.
3 more days with ashlee.  mmmmm.

here is the deal kids.  the friday after thanksgiving, im coming to nashville.  staying until monday.  then im coming back the 17th of december, and staying thru early march (with perhaps a few short excursions to little rock)  after that, i have no earthly idea what, where, who i will be.  ive never been so unsure and scared about my future.  so nashville, i need you to show me a good time like i know only you can.
tonight we dance... for tomorrow they release the hounds."

letter one- (sent Sunday night)
Dear Glenda,
I know I probably speak for all of us here in New York, but what sort of senior activities and responsibilites that we need to fulfill.  Everything from like senior audits to graduation forms or whatnot.  It's not like I really have anyone to even ask about all of this.  If you could email us a list of all the normal senior responsibilities, or better yet a copy of all the forms that would be great.  If nothing else, if you could just grab a couple copies of each big form, and mail them to Dr. Harrington, I'm sure that that could head off a lot of beurocratic problems for us all next semester.  Thanks so much.
Paul Hinman

response one - (recieved sometime monday)
Hi Paul,
I am forwarding the last email I sent about senior information.  You need to contact Tina Dishman at dishmant@mail.belmont.edu.  I know I have sent several other emails about this information and made the announcement at the meeting while I was in New York.  Please let me know if you are not receiving my emails.  
Thanks!
Glenda

<enclosed letter>
Hi again! 
Just so you know you are missed around here, I wanted to send you a quick update on what's going on in Nashville....even though I am sure you still talk to your friends here.
First of all, here's a link to an article that was in the Tennessean last Friday on Belmont East http://www.tennessean.com/business/archives/04/08/57293802.shtml?Element_ID=57293802 and check out Belmont's FYI http://forum.belmont.edu/umac/archives/2004/09/music_business_2.html as your picture is on there ;)
The CEMB College also has a new website that will be imperative for you guys to check everyday http://forum.belmont.edu/muzzbuzz/.  Please set this as your homepage even....all advising, senior information, etc will be on here and with you being in New York it is extra important that you refer to this site!
If you are planning to graduate in December, please contact Tina Dishman at dishmant@mail.belmont.edu.  She will also be who you contact when advising begins.
We have our first ""The Insiders View"" (music business seminar) tomorrow evening and we are so excited to have Ruta Sepetys as the first featured guest of this series.  She represents a diverse stable of established artists including:  Grammy award winning guitarist Steve Vai, multi-platinum modern rock 
chart-toppers LIT, blues phenom Eric Sardinas, and film/television composer Niels Bye Nielsen.   Sorry you guys will miss it!
You guys also remember that Belmont Vision is online so you can keep up with university happenings also at http://www.belmontvision.com/.
Hope some of this information helps....and to hear from you.
Glenda


letter 2- (sent tuesday morning)
Dear Glenda Cones,
I have gotten your emails.  The issue is that they don't answer any of my questions.  Apparently application to graduate May 2005 is due sometime during November.  I'm sure there are other announcements that we have missed.
I have emailed Tina Dishman, but I would appreciate not being given a pat response.  If you arent the person I need to contact, simply let me know.  I know that you arent even our primary contact for Belmont East.  However, I no longer have the information as to the woman who took Jennifer Armstrong's position.  I certainly havent heard from her over the course of this semester.  I have done what I can to stay connected and informed.  I check the Belmont website(s), I have spoken to fellow students still in Nashville.  Regardless, I am still 15 hours away and can only do so much.
I apologize for the tone of this letter.  It is simply frustrating to be given the run-around.  Thank you again for your help, and I hope this can help us get some of the last few kinks of this program ironed out.  We're all having a great time and want to see this become a great asset for the music business program.  Thanks again.
Paul Hinman

letter 2b- (i didnt know until later that tina dishman is married tina adair, also sent tuesday morning)
Tina Dishman,
Hello, My name is Paul Hinman, I am one of the seniors currently in New York as part of Belmont East alongside with 16 other students.  We all have quite a few questions about senior and graduation info and Glenda Cones refuses to offer any serious help.  So I've been referred to you, and I know that you'll be much more helpful.
None of us are entirely sure as to what requirements we still need to meet to be on track for graduation (i.e. Senior Audits, Intent to Graduate forms, any other number of forms that we haven't been told about).  I know that sometime in November, application for may graduation is due.
If nothing else, if you could just go down to Belmont Central, and grab a copy or two of every form and mail it to myself, I will make copies to give everyone.  Apparently this is too difficult for anyone in the Music Business office.
Thank you so much for your help.  All of us hoping to graduate in May thank you.
Paul Hinman

response 2- (recieved shortly after lunch tuesday, much of the info also sent to all other bel yorkers)
Hi Paul,
Thanks for your email.  You are right in that we are ironing out last minute
kinks...and we appreciate of all your cooperation and understanding 100%.
You stated ""If you arent the person I need to contact, simply let me know.""
I let you know that Tina Dishman was the person to contact.  I was just
trying to reinforce that she is the advising and senior information contact
person.  Please know that I am always more than happy to answer any of your
questions, I am just trying to continue communicating the importance of
reading emails and checking the website.  You are again correct, since we
are 15 hours away it's imperative that we all respond and stay up to date.
Your email was  a great check for all of us here in Nashville to realize the
importance of checking in with you guys more often.
No need to apologize for the tone of your letter.  You were simply stating
the way you felt and I respect that.  I hope you understand that I am not
trying giving you the run around.  I am simply trying to establish the
importance of the website and reading emails carefully.
We have a great group of students in NYC and we are so excited that you have
all excelled so quickly.  Thank you so much for being such a great
representative of our Program.
Belmont East ""personnel"":
Michael Harrington - Faculty in Residence - ANY immediate Belmont East needs including housing, class schedules, classroom meeting space, transportation issues...this list really encompasses any immediate Belmont East needs.
Tina Dishman - Any advising issues
Kellie Meeks - Kellie is the administrator for this program and is the best resource for financial aid issues and any general Belmont East issues that may not be immediate
Internships - Kyle T. Jones is no longer in this area and will be hiring someone soon to fill this need.  You can contact me for now
Glenda Cones - Strategic Programs Director - My primary responsibility is ensuring these programs are put together.  Since most of the staff is new at these programs I have been a primary contact, which I love, but could actually cause confusion as to I am no longer advising, etc.  I am more than happy to address concerns, accomplishments and guidance.
All this said, this is a perfect world scenario and a structure we are learning to perfect.  As already mentioned, we appreciate all of your hard work and representation of this program.  Please let me know any questions you may have.
Glenda

response 2b- (recieved shortly after lunch tuesday)
Hey Paul,
I just sent a lengthy email out to all of you at Belmont East regarding 
senior information. Be looking for it!!
Thanks,
Tina

Hey guys,
I hope you are all having a wonderful semester!!!  I know a lot of you have been in question about what you need to do as a senior if you are planning on graduating in May  2005.  Hopefully I will provide you will the information that will ease your mind a little!!
First of all, graduation applications are due in Belmont Central by November 14th.  Therefore, I am going mail hard copies of the graduation application to Michael Harrington.  He then can distribute them to you all.  You must fill these out as soon as you get them, and they need to be mailed back to us no later than the day after you receive them.  
Once you have completed and mailed back this intent to graduation, then the Registrar's office will begin work on your Sr. Audit.  This is an official checklist of everything you have taken and everything you lack to graduate.  
Also, I will be reviewing your files to see that you are on track as well.  If I run into a problem, you will be notified.  Priority registration begins on November 15 and goes through November 19.  I am attaching the registration form to this email.  Sometime before registration begins you will need to email this completed back to me and I will release your hold ""without advising"" so you can go ahead and register at that time.  Please DO NOT forget to complete this registration form and email it back to me sometime before November 15 in order for me to release your hold.
If you have anymore questions regarding graduation requirements or class scheduling please feel free to call or email me at:  615-460-6892 or dishmant@mail.belmont.edu.
One last thing.....if you have convo questions please contact the Student Affairs office at:  615-460-6407.
I am sending this to all of you that are at Belmont East this semester; therefore I need to know exactly which of you are planning on graduating in May.  Please email me back with your name and all contact info if you are planning on graduating in May.
Thanks,
Tina Dishman


i think this is the closest i will ever get to an appology for belmont's incompetence... and i accept it.

"event","why does belmont have to give me such shit all the time?  yesterday (or sunday) i emailed the music business office about what i (and my fellow bel-yorkers) need to do to graduate.  stuff like application for may graduation.  advising for spring classes.  senior audits.  etc.  things that could be taken care of with a simple trip to belmont central (durring which one would fill out a form, get the proper signatures, and be quickly notified that it is the wrong form, despite that same individual telling you that it was the proper form only hours earlier).  all i need is some damn forms sent to us.  instead, i've been given the same pat responses about how ""i already sent you an email that didnt answer your questions, would you like me to send you that same useless email again?""

in case you cant tell, i am rather frustrated.  i have just finished mailing off a number of scathing emails.  fortunately, my dad will be in town tonight.  we're going out to dinner.  he always knows how to handle these situations.  so cool, calm, collected, all the while telling the idiot exactly how and why they are an idiot and how they can apologize to him.  amazing!!!  i just dont know how he does it sometimes.  so im definately looking forward to that.

tomorrow josh is coming.  plus cmj this weekend.  its going to be fun fun fun times.    you've got to love that"

in other news, i get comedy central now, not to mention 4 channels of pornography.  and not just late night cinemax porn, but real honest to goodness porno.  im almost afraid to turn on my tv now.  there has got to be a way to block those channels and still get comedy central. argh.  damn you new yorker hotel!

i am currently reading america the book.  by the cast of the daily show.  did you know that 96% of congressional incumbents are re-elected every term- which means the other 4% must suck almost as bad as good charolette.  (oh, it all comes back... now thats comedy!)

"event","i know many of you have your opinions made up as to how you will vote in november.  i would really hope that all of you have already done what ever is nessicary for absentee voting in your state (its a real bitch for arkansas).  but i would like to encourage everyone to watch the debates tomorrow night.  9pm est/8pm ctl.  
AND in addition to watching, you should go to mtvU.com and vote for who you think is doing a better job.  i know its stupid or whatever, and you think that im sucking up to viacom, but honestly, id rather people who are going to stop and think about what kind of impact they can have voting.  young people are all saying how important voting is this election, and while it is, how many of them are doing it b/c p. diddy is telling them to ""vote or die""?
be a more informed voter.  and dont let media analysts tell you who ""won"" afterwards... be a part something, give your opinion.  let people know that not all college students fit some sort of cookie cutter mold.

"event","so friday night we went karaoke-ing.  that was great.  i finally learned the words to a couple songs that i never really understood, including ""get low"" by lil' john and the east side boyz, featuring the ying yang twins.  i also made elliott sing dashboard.  that was great.
not great was saturday night.  it was open bar at misshapes.  i drank far far FAR too much vodka.  i ended up puking and falling asleep on the street.  thank goodness for those 3 kind boys who helped me into a cab.  sunday i stayed in bed until 630.  i felt terrible.  i dont ever want to drink like that again.  i was just being stupid.  im lucky that i didnt end up worse than i did.  ugh.
today at work though, i did get to see rufus wainright for free.  it was amazing.  if it wasnt for ashlee, id let him get a piece.  (im just kidding... kinda)  he played like 6 or 7 songs.  the man is incredible, thats all there is to it."

"event","two in a day... crazy

earlier today a transfomer blew or something.  all i know is that i heard an incredibly loud blast, followed by another maybe 30 seconds later. it was this incredible BOOM!! and my first thought was that somebody had set off a bomb in penn station.  i kept looking out the window, but i can really see the street.  i just knew i heard tons of sirens.  i thought for sure i was going to go downstairs and start having to shovel away rubble and bodies.  i was serriously pretty worried.  i turned on the news, but they never said anything about it.  it was terrible.

in other news, rodney dangerfield has been in a coma for two weeks and it just made the press.  its been my life long dream for him to speak at my funeral.  at which i want him to hit on my mom, and make some terribly innappropriate jokes durring my eulogy.  when now one laughs, he should pull at his collar and say ""geez, why all the long faces, its like somebody died""  (my funeral is to be a light occation despite however distrought whoever attends might be)  well, mr. dangerfield, you are in my prayers."

"event","preface: this entry will be long-ish, and quite disjointed.

walking around in the last 3 hours or so, i have recieved 4 compliments on my hair.  i havent taken a shower or done anything but move it around a bit with my fingers for 3 days now.  its super oily.  but somehow it does look pretty good.  im hotter on the streets than the new young buck album.

i have been stopped twice today by either children intl, or orginizations raising money for children intl.  i dont know if i just look very compassionate, or gulible.  maybe its b/c i wasnt listening to music today.  maybe its b/c i cant help but make eye contact sometimes.  maybe its b/c im too nice to simply walk away.

last night i finally got to do some writing with elliott.  not that we really got anything done, but its great to finally play, even if its just a little.

i got a second internship at insound.  it should be great chance to meet some fellow hipsters and hear some great music.  rock woot

sunday night we made dinner for jamie, suzanna, and morgan.  i cant say how authentically greek it was, but it was delicious if i do say so myself.

talking to ashlee on the phone the past few nights has been amazing.  weird how a little tiff will end up making you closer.

last night i made the mistake of watching the beheading of that american man.  you all know how grossed out i get by stuff like that, and i start to shake.  i think i may have shook all night.  i have never been so disgusted in all my life. the sounds alone i think will haunt me.  i could not believe the ferocity of the masked men (i use the word men lightly).  i dont understand the sheer hatred that could fuel this sort of thing.  it was so humiliating... treating a human worse than even the lowest and dirtiest of animals.  i cant help but feel outraged and sick.  i would say the groups doing this deserve death, but no.  they would be recieved as martyrs, fueling more hatred and disgust and evil.  americans have done terrible things across the globe.  i'd like to believe that those waving our flag have not committed attrocities this terrible, but i know better.  it seems that humanity has reached a depravity unlike any other era.  but humans have always done terrible things to one another.  but being so consumed with hate is something i hope to never understand.  i am praying for Jesus' return."

"event","i guess you could say this weekend has been pretty gay... and i dont mean gay lame, i mean gay homosexual.  friday night we went to go see the rocky horror picture show.  i want to go see it again, especially when the crowd is more together in thier responses they yell out, and i havent had so much to drink.  heath was hillarous though, b/c he was feeling good, and wanted so badly to know what to yell.  it was great.
saturday we went to the beach.  rockaway beach.  that fat joe is full of shit.  but i certainly did lean back.  no, it was really funny - and hour train ride out there, only to walk thru the ghetto.  everyone was giving us that ""you boys lost?"" look.  it was great.  the four of us raised the grand total of people on the beach to... 8.  but it was so nice to be out of the city and just relax.  we all fell asleep pretty quick, then woke up when it was cold.
anyway, we got back from the beach, and decided to head out to this chinese place a friend had told us about.  on the train ride there, these two little kids kept snickering and pointing at us and stuff.  then one finally worked up the courage to say something like ""hey homo"" or something.  so michael and i just laughed, and he gave them this really effiminate wave back.  that sent them thru the roof!  they couldnt stop with like ""ew, gross... sick... those dudes is gay""  that kinda stuff.  but then this puerto rican guy got pissed at them.  he came up to us and said not to mind them, then started yelling at them.  it was just amazing, b/c its the first time that ive really seen anyone intollerant of anyone other than a republican.  after the puerto rican guy left, the kids just kept saying stupid stuff to us.  they'd leave, then come back down the up escalator just to yell something at us.  i think if i were gay, id be a bit more offended.  maybe not.  we just know that those kids are going to get their asses beat if they keep doing stuff like this.  as for being called gay, im pretty used to it.  i thought this city having such a large gay population, everyone would be able to tell who is and who isnt.  apparently though, everyone just assumes semi-effeminant boys like myself are.
back to lucky chengs.  that was amazing.  the entire staff are drag queens.  they were all so over the top and painted up.  it was crazy.  there was every type too, the obviously men drag queens to the ""that might actually be a woman"" queens.  one guy wears nothing but a bikini, and has a body most girls would kill for.  ridiculous!  a lot of fun though.  im thinking i should take my parents there.
halloween it is... we're going to have so much fun.  i miss you"

josh is probably coming up in october.  so is amanda.  and of course im ecstatic about my life partner coming up.  (i miss her so much.)  its going to be party time central to the maxx!!

in other news, i realized, i dont get bet OR comedy central on this gay hotel cable network.  it might be a good thing b/c i wont watch too much tv.  but i think it might be more of a terrible horrible thing."

"event","last night was alot of fun.  michael and i finally found some hipsters (dont call them scenesters, or they'll get pissed).  we also saw a woman wearing nothing but glitter walk into ray's pizza at 3 in the morning.  but besides that, it was a good night.  we both want to meet people here so bad.  not that we're really lonely yet, but we're just ready to get plugged into the deal.  i was walking to my room today and it just struck me how lonely this city could become.  thats why im ready to start my internship.  im ready to get plugged in with some people here.  im ready to get on a schedule.

beyond that things are progressing.  its hard to know what exactly is happening, you cant seperate yourself from the action.  ive only been here a week, and it certainly feels ive been here longer than that.  i do know that ive been listening to alot of metal recently.  weird, huh?

i did have an amazing conversation with herrington after going to see a play for class.  the play was this political satire.  it was pretty funny.  the most times ive heard the word ""fuck"" at the theatre... by a long shot.  then i walked the 30 something blocks back to my room and listened to harrington say the sort of things that no other belmont professor could say.  it was amazing.

my girlfriend is amazing.  there is no doubt about that.  i like having her in my life in whatever way possible.  i wish i could make things easier"

"event","quite possibly my favourite part of the city is walking around listening to music.  ive done it for hours in the short time that ive been here already.  music with a strong beat.  music that makes everything fall into place.  i love alot about being here.  i hate not being able to share it with all the people who give my life the meaning it has.  i miss nashville imensly, but not in a homesick kind of way.  i want to be here.  but i want everyone to be happy.  i see far to much depression in the lives of those i care about.  i cant understand it completely, but i do love them all, and just want them to feel loved... truely loved.  the love of God that you see in the love of people.  the love of peace.

the new interpol is really good.  it makes me like the band.  first record never did it for me.  i should find out when its coming out so i can buy it.  the new further seems forever... not all that i wanted.  too sensefield to me.  but that is just one man's humble opinion.

protesters are funny.  i cant help but think what nathan would have to say to them.  i just know that it is lame when i want to go back to my room, but i have to walk 4 blocks out of my way.  the subway exit is literally caddy-corner from the hotel and no amount of cajoling or pointing or pulling out id and room key will get me thru the baracades.  but the cnn temporary headquarters is in my building.  for some reason, you cant help but be exicited by all the press badges and cameras and newscasters.  it gives the air electricity."

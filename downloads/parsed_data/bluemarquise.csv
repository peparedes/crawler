"event","It's Ko-chan's birthday. And it's also an ungodly hour of the morning. Though I'm sure he'll be up. No doubt of that being the insufferable morning person that he is.

Hm. That was very unpleasant. I didn't mean it it to sound that way, really. I wouldn't be up, dressed, and scheming if my best friend didn't mean so much to me after all. 

But morning person I am not. Nor social creature. And standing outside his apartment door, I was beginning to doubt the plan I had felt so sure of the night before.

Why all this nervousness? Breathe Mana. Just go through with it. I took a deep breath and raised my fist to knock on the door. Inside, I heard a muffled crash and what sounded like, ""Coming!"" Was I interrupting his morning ritual? Fell off the bed?

My musings were cut short as the door opened to reveal Kozi's smiling face. Someone was genki this morning. It was cute. Panic. He blinked to see me standing there and his expression changed slightly.

""Shufu-san, to what do I owe the pleasure?""

He looked pleased. More panic.

""It's your birthday.""

He beamed expectantly. ""Yes..""

My words came out in a rush.

""I'm taking you out.""

Kozi looked startled for a moment before being distracted. He was looking at the roses I held in my left hand.

""Oooooh! Are those for me-?""

I snatched the bundle out of reach.

""No, they're for the children.""

He was now looking at me as if I'd grown a pair of horns. I took that as an opportunity to hand him the rather large picnic basket. He staggered under the weight of the basket and I looked at my watch.

""We should go now,"" I announced.

Kozi laughed. ""But where, my sweet Mana, are you taking me?""

I gave him a severe look. ""That would spoil the surprise.""

He smiled broadly. ""Then I suppose that I will just have to content myself to be your willing captive.""

I smiled then. Just a little. I like the sound of that."

"event","Ever have a day where you positively couldn't hear yourself think? It's been one of those. I woke up this morning with the hope of composing something. But after two hours of attempts that were leading me nowhere, I was considering just crawling back into bed where it seemed I should have stayed in the first place.

Then my eyes fell upon the pot of basil you brought over yesterday. And I changed my mind. 

Might as well focus my energy towards something else. Contrary to dining out, cooking has always had the power to calm me. Eating in a restuaraunt involves new people and you know how I feel about that. Only for you, Ko-chan, do I make an exception.

It worked like a charm. By the time I had finished, I as feeling considerably more relaxed and less furious. Lucky for my poor, abused guitars... I winced. There was going to be a mess to clean up tomorrow. 

Now, my only problem is that I have a wonderful pesto but there is far too much of it for just one person. I think I will pay Ko-chan a visit and see if he can't help me with that. What better way to thank him for his gift."

"event","Well well. 

I wasn't going to go through with this at first. But Kozi was very insistent. 

You see me everyday. What do you mean, you miss me?

So, at his request, here I am.

Happy now, Ko-chan?"

"event","so, I went out for my mom's birthday and my brother brought along maxie and rob. My brother and I somehow brought up the story about how we had bodyguards when we were little. We went through like 4 and I remember this one, and he was seriously crazy. Whenever I was in the 1st grade, during choir this one day he came in my class with his ""top secret"" briefcase which he wouldn't tell us what was in it, and a gun and was like HEY KATHRYN DUJKA IT'S TIME TO GO! and my teacher would be like ""why are you taking her out?"" and he would always be like ""It's top secret business ma'am"" and then he, my brother, and I would go eat or something. He would basically take us out of school for nothing. Then he taught my brother karate and he would always want to go to the store to buy ice cream and shit. Then my mom fired him, because he was freakin crazy. 
We had to do this for protection, so don't think that my family is weird and we just get random bodyguards, because that's what maxie and rob were thinking. 
This is the same rob that got kicked off the bus in elementary for throwing 5 stink bombs on the bus."

"event","Funny thing happened today in gym.
This kid named ross that is 17 but is in 9th grade got a little carried away when he lost at knockout.
First he was yelling at all of us who were playing knockout and was like ""FUCKING BITCHES LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE YOU CHEATED! YOU CHEATED!"" and so i was like okay, i don't understand why you're making a big deal over a game of knockout. And then he slammed the basketball on the ground, then he threw the basketball at this girl misty, then shoved this girl named Gladys. All because Misty blocked his basketball and she made the goal before he did. Then he was telling me how he bitch-slapped a girl. So then Gladys told the coaches and ross got written up. Then ross went crazy and he started punching the coaches. Then all these guys were trying to fight him. 
My brother knows him and sais he has something wrong with him. So basically he won't get in trouble. But come monday, he's probably going to get beat up because Gladys has alot of gangsta friends.
Craziest thing I've witnessed in my life."

"event","...ahh the wise words of my roommate. annnnyway. its been as usual, forever, since i have updated this thing. Ashley updated hers and it reminded me that i should update mine. umm. so this semester, im failing bio. i just took a lab exam which i acutally think i did pretty well but we'll see how that works out. i went to oc  this weekend with my parents, nothing too fabulous. did some shopping, other than that didnt really do much. umm. the past three weekends before i went home for alyssas, katherines, then ashleys birthday parties. they were all fun :) ummmm nothing new is really new except for the fact that i cant wait for this damn semeter to be over with. i am sick of my roommate and classes and cant wait for summer. most of all i cant wait to move  out of chester. i came back yesterday morning and someone is sleeping in my bed. im like wtf mate? thanks for asking if you can have someone sleep in my bed. not that i should be surprised because it happens like every weekend, i dunno i think thats pretty disrespectful. i would never ever let anyone sleep in her bed without asking. but whatever. just like she takes shit out of my closet while im gone, food, water bottles, movies, you name it she takes it. im like wtf, why do you think its okay to just take my stuff without asking? i dont even touch your stuff, let alone use it. and shes like are you mad when i walk in? hell yeah im mad but im not gonna say anything because i dont want to start stuff, its bad enough as it is, without added tension, ya know? ughhh. thank god its only like another six weeks, i dont think i could take it much longer. i cant wait for next year, to have a roommate that i can trust while im home for the weekend and dont have to worry about my stuff being messed with. next year should be fun, living with lindsay, leeann and megan.  we're living in a quad and we'll all share a bathroom. im definitely looking forward to it. i wish that this year i could have had a roommate that i got along really well with but that obviously didnt happen. oh well. like i said, thank god its almost over. so spring break starts this friday. im so excited for that, a whole week of sleeeping in :) i think thats the best part. im excited to spend time with my family, i havent seen ashley since her bday party and forgot to say goodbye to her. i was in such a rush i didnt even say good bye :( i need to start studying for my bio lecture exam which is on wednesday. ughhh. this week i have bio lab, bio lecture, history, spanish, and chem exam. of course teachers like to pack it all in sine we're all loooking forward to break. ok. i dunno what else to say and i should be doing my stat homework before i gotta go to work. ewww. work."

"event","Wow, it's been a while. I kind of forgot about this journal thing. Not much has been going on lately. Lots of school work, studying, and partying. Minus part three. Haha. Um, I went home this past weekend. It's the first time I had been home since school started. Ashley gave me my package :) Friday afternoon/night, I went to the Old MIll vs. GLen Burnie games. The boys lost by 1 point. It was a really good game. Then I just went home and watched TV with my mom until Ashley came home at like 10ish. Then Saturday, Ashley and I got up all early to go to Arundel Mills and my stupid oil light came on. So, I turned around and put oil in my car and couldn't get the hood closed. So, needless to say, my hood is currently being held together in ghetto fabulous fashion with a bungee cord. Don't be jealous that your car isnt that hot. Anyways, so we ended up going shopping an hour and a half later than planned, got some lunch and I got a hat, and some shirts at Old Navy for spring. Then, Burnham and I went up to Jeff's grave. I didn't get to go to the viewing since I was here so I wanted to go, just out of like respect. Wow. I know I wasn't like really good friends with him but I would definitely consider him a friend and its really weird to think that he's not here anymore. All the flowers and various things on his grave just goes to show how many people loved him and how many will miss him. It's really sad. I also visited my grandfather's grave while I was there, I haven't seen it in like atleast probably 7 years? I dont even know. But I put a rose in there...Yeah, so then my family and I went to dinner and came back and we rented The Grudge. Pretty much the worst movie ever. I heard it was supposed to be good. But, no. Then we watched Maryland beat Duke in overtime!! That was exciting. Sunday, I woke up, went to Wal Mart for some school stuff, visited the grandmothers and ate dinner with my family. Then headed back here. And my tape got stuck in my VCR. Grrrrr. The tape is like all ripped up now. PUff that. So that was my weekend. Nothing too thrilling. It's always nice to be home though. Aww. And my dad gave me pretty white roses for Valentine's Day :) They're on display on my desk. Um, last week was...um last week? I went to the gym for the first time in a long time, with Meg and Leanne. Probably failed my chem and bio test. I dunno, it was a really long week for some reason. Okay, gonna get ready for bed. Let me know if you read this so I dont feel like I'm writing publicly to myself. Muahaha."

"event","It's like 1:15 right now and I am so bored. I'll be spending the next two weekends down here so...anyway. UMM, classes have started. They don't seem too bad, except for my chem class might not be too fun. My teacher seems like she doesn't really know much. I have to wonder where they find these people. My stat class is SO small. It's like the size of my dorm room with 20 desks packed in to it. History is at 8 am so we'll see how that goes. :/ I really like my bio class since there's a lot of people I know in it. Last night I didn't really do anything, just hung out with Lindsay. I was going to go to Erin's swim meet today but that started at 1:00. Haha. I need to do my chem homework. We have like a week to do it but I'd rather get it done with now. It should be fun doing it since I have no idea what it is, we didn't learn anything in class yet. So, yeah that should be fun. Good thing Lindsay is good at chem so she can help me :) My life is really boring right now I really have no idea what else to say. I'm sad I missed Chelsea's birthday last night. I would much rather have been home then sitting here. I wish I knew more people. Like I know people but I don't hang out with them. I dunno. It's hard to just like go up and introduce yourself to new people. Okay this is really boring and I dunno what else to say. Have a good weekend."

"event","So, its definitely been a while. I'm back at school now. My dad moved me back in yesterday. It kind of feels good to be back actually. I finally finished unpacking around 11 last night. It took me forever. I just didnt know what to do with everything. I've already had two classes today-spanish at 8 and chem at 9. My spanish teacher walked in and started talking all this spanish and i was just like oh shit i should drop this. But then she would say spanish and then translate it in english and she seems really nice so it should be fun. Shes really young and she definitely seems like she could make it a fun class. Chemistry on the other hand...is chemistry. But I'm really excited b/c Patty is in my class and I had history with her last semester. And I met one of her friends so it should be fun. We all have bio together too so I'm excited that I actually know some people in my classes. I also have thsoe classes with my roommate so lots of people to know. Umm. All I really did over winter break was work so I'm actually kind of happy to be back here b/c I was getting sick of working. I dunno what else to say, I'll prob update again tonight after work...if I'm bored. Yay for Newlyweds and the Ashlee Simpson show being on tonight!!"

"event","And it's already January 3rd. I have to say that I am kinda sad to see 2004 go by. 2004 was an incredible year and I'm sad its gone. So let's see, since the last update. On Wednesday, I headed up to Hidden Valley with the Curran clan and Burnham and Ali. We went to Cracker Barrel for dinner. YUMM. And we got to PA around 10ish I think. We unpacked and played some poker and then went to bed. We woke up on Thursday and went skiing from like 1130-6ish. I actually made it on the ski lift this time! I fell off the first three times though :( I think I spent more time on my ass than I did on skis but oh well it was a lot of fun and I actually eventually did learn how to get off of the ski lift. So we had lunch at the lodge which was expensive but pretty good. Then, we had tacos for dinner and headed off to go snow tubing. The guy who was hooking the tubes to the line was awful and sucked. So twice we just climbed up the mountain. So that was definitely fun...not. We made like chains of all of our tubes. Haha. It was fun. Then we went back and I took a much needed shower and made s'mores. Next day, we packed up and went to the general store and came home. I had like 10 minutes to do whatever and then I had to babysit. I was there for only like 5 hours and I made $100. So that was really exciting, then I went and picked up the drunks from Nick's house. Saturday, I did nothing but sleep and clean and go to lunch with Ashley. Yesterday, same thing except went to Wal Mart with my mom and Target with Chelsea and Katherine. And last night, the Penetrators had a game and got their asses kicked like 12-0. Got up at 5:15 this morning for work. Got to work at 630 in the am which is so unnatural. The sun wasn't even up yet! I got off at like 330 came home and now I'm sitting here. I don't feel like going to the gym so I'm gonna go tomorrow, on my day off. School starts in like 3 weeks :( NOt looking forward to classes starting again, but it means less days until SUMMER. Yay for summer! Tonight is Brittany's last night home in Maryland. So, I gotta go say my farewell to her. :(
My bestest friend is leaving me :( Guess we'll just have to make some road trips. Ok, well I'm out. Talk to you all later."

"event","How did it get to be December 26th already? I've been home for almost two weeks now. Sad. It didn't feel like Christmas at all this year. It felt like just a normal day even though it was the same thing we've done for years, it just didn't feel like Christmas. It was more fun when we believed in Santa. It was still good though, I got lots of clothes, a dart board, photo albums, pajamas, money, gift cards...and the list goes on. I'm going shopping tomorrow in hopes of finding some new clogs because mine are the cheapest things ever. Ummm. I worked all last week and now I have 2 paychecks to put in the bank. I also get paid for next week even though I don't have to work. Yay! Next week, we are possibly going to go skiing up to Brit's place. I have to babysit all day on Tuesday for a 1 year old so that should be fun. Last Tuesday, me, Brit, Burnham and Ali went out to dinner, the sex store and exchanged gifts. The sex store is always fun. Haha. There were so many people in there, Christmas shopping perhaps? I don't really care to know. Then, Wednesday the Hines were over for dinner and Thursday, I dunno. I worked all day, 8-6. Annd Friday, I baked all day, went to church, went to my aunts then came back and baked some more. Today we had another party for the Steelers vs. Ravens game. YAYY Steelers! Boooo Ravens. My dad's ghettttto co workers were over. Then we went to the Fryes for dinner. THen to the Penetrators game and now I'm here. I really need to do laundry but I think I'll wait until tomorrow? I guess it's time to take down my Christmas decorations :( Thats depressing. I dont want to go back to school. BOOO classes. Oh well. I'm gonna clean my closet. I think its about to throw up my clothes."

I go back to work tomorrow. I'm pretty excited about that actually. This weekend I didn't do a whole lot except for shop. Last night, went to the Penetrators indoor game. Thats' always fun. And it snowed last night!! :) That was so much fun. It's so nice to sit around with absolutely nothing to do, especially no reading or writing papers or studying. I wish I could live this way forever. But, oh well. I can't believe Christmas is in four days. It doesn't even feel like it. I really have nothing else to say since I haven't done a damn thing in the past 5 days. Tonight is cookie baking and lollipop making with Ashley and Stephanie so that should be adventurous. Other than that, Battle of the Sexes comes on. I was supposed to babysit tonight but my aunt called and said the lady I was to sit for was sick so I'm not doing that anymore. I could use the money but at the same time it's nice to do nothing. Dinner's ready. Gotta go. Hope everyone is having a good winter break."

I had already packed up all of my stuff so Laney helped and we got the car all packed up. We finally got out of Salisbury at like 11:30 or so. Then, my dad,knowing how to ""treat a lady"" lol took me to Taco Bell for lunch. He still has his spider bite :( Then, we got home and unpacked all my stuff and I eventually finsihed unpacking-it took me hours. I have soo much stuff. But anyways. My mom and dad and I had dinner and then I went to the movies with Brit and Burnham and saw Saw. WOW. That movie was so f'n scary. I think I covered my eyes for more parts than I actually watched. It was so creepy. So then I came up and made Ashley wait for me in the door. :) And I watched some TV and Dodgeball with Ryan and Jenny and went to bed at like 2:30 and woke up at 12:30 the next day. Such a good feeling. I got up and before I showered and eveything Ashley came up from school. LOL. Then we went to Wal Mart and the library and came home and did...nothing. Got some dinner then Kae and Cee came over to watch The OC. The best show ever made. Then, Ashley and I watched Life as we know it. And that was pretty much my day. Nothing to exciting yet so glad to be home. I found out I got an 87% on my psych final! I am so happy because I needed an 86 to get a B in the class. So I just barely got it! My teachers are taking forever to get our grades posted up. Grrr. Tomorrow I'm getting up early, like 730 to bring Kae to the car place, then to Panera, then to my grandmothers house. Ashley has to work at 4 :( But then on Saturday we're going shopping! One week from tomorrow is Christmas Eve. I can't believe it. Its crazy. It doesn't feel like Christmas at all. IT's kind of sad actually. OH well. I""m gonna get going. Sorry this is a really boring entry.

I have an exam at 8 and my dad should be here around 9:30ish. I think that's part of the reason I can't sleep. I'm like so anxious to go home and for exams to be over. Anywayyys. I got back here on Sunday. Leanne drove me back. I went home with her on Friday. Umm, Friday. Ryan picked me up then I went to the bank and saw Aaron Waddell. Haven't talked to him in a while.  And I talked to Ms. Luann then left and went home. And? went to the OM basketball games. That was fun. First time I've been back to OM since...graduation? So, yeah then my dad and I picked up a pizza and went home to my mother who was ""babysitting"". LOL, Ashley's DRP project. Sat-woke up at 7 to that damn crying baby and again at 10. Got up, showered, went to Kohls with my momma then did nothing all night except study and watch Ashley self mutilate herself with the Christmas tree and knock it over onto herself. So, that was fun. Sunday, woke up again to that baby. THen, did f'n homework and studying all day, left around 530 to meet Leanne, got back here, had a floor meeting, studied then wokeup for my 8 am exam, bio. I think I did okay on that. Then I had my english exam after lunch with Laney and Leanne. That was...gay. Went to dinner and back to study some more. Tuesday woke up for another 8 am exam-sociology. I think I did reallly good. I needed a B so I hope I got it. Then, went to lunch with Laney and Lindsay. And at 3:15 and History...umm yeah NUFF SAID. LOL. THen, dinner, study, fireside to study, study, shower, study. You get the idea. I NEED a B on this damn psychology exam tomrorow, well actually today. In like 6 1/2 hours. Oh joy. I'm f'n nervous. So, I'm all packed up and ready to head back to GB tomorrow. I gotta get some money back from my books too...prob a big $7? Hey better than nothing. Yeah, so call me up over Winter Break. I'll be home until Jan. 25th. Daaaaaamn that's a while! Talk/ see everyone soon!!!!!! :)"

"event","Heck yes. Only 10 more days until I get to go home for Winter Break. I can't wait. A whole 5 weeks of no class and get to be home. Yessss. SO I went home this weekend. Left on Friday with Meg and Leanne around 12. My dad picked me up @ Old Navy around 1:30ish and we did a bit of shopping. I got a cute black fleece jacket...can't have it until Christmas though. Puff! So, then I dropped my Dad off to pick up his car and went home and spend some time with Ashley before she had to go to work. Puff PB. Then I went up to the daycare. I had soo much fun. I love the daycare. All my favorite kids remembered me so that made me happy. I'm going back to work there for atleast a week during break. I also got an application for Glory Days so hopefully I can get a job there and make some decent money over Winter break. I really need it. So, I got back from the daycare sat around for like an hour because my parents couldn't decide where to go for dinner. So we ended up at Glory Days, then I went home, got out the Christmas tree and helped my mom and dad put it up. Then, my mom and I went to pick up Ashley @ work. Of course we waited for, oh, 45 mins? Yeah, just sitting there for 45 f'n mins. Oh well. Then, Ashley came home, we went home and watched <3 channel 101. I love it. It has like the bestest shows ever. Boys vs. Girls Montana is the best. And I can watch it for the next like 2 months! Yes!! Yeah, so then I just went to bed woke up at like 11ish. Oh wait. No I woke up @ 3 am when RYan came into my room to tell me that he saw Michael Phelps. He comes in my room, turns on my light is like telling me about how he met Michael Phelps at a bar in Baltimore and he exaagerated with the chest bump. LoL. I never thought I would miss Ryan. Haha. Yeah, I woke up and ate a yummy muffin that Ashley brought home from PB. Went over to the Fryes for a few while waiting for my mom and Ashley to get home from the mall. They came home, and we put up the Christmas tree! Yay!! And my dad put up the outside lights and the reindeer. Umm. Then, Ashley went to work :( and my mom and I went shopping and to Plaza Garbaldi for dinner. <3 Mexican food. Then we went to Walgreens and got my pics developed. They've been on my camera for like 3 weeks now so I wanted to clear my memory card. Anyway. Later that night, we went to pick Ashley up from work and came back and did absolutely nothing. Ashley went to bed at like 1130 so I was by myself b/c she had to work at 6am. I ended up baking some cookies. Cleaned the kitchen then headed upstairs and went to bed. Woke up at like 1030, got my stuff together, ate some breakfast, showered, relaxed then met Alaina up at PB to leave for Salisbury. And thats where I am now. Got back here at like 4ish? Ate some tuna fish for dinner. Yeah. EXTREMELY PISSED OFF b/c Desperate Housewives isn't on tonight. That was like the biggest disapointment of the day. Now, I am watching Viva la Bam which I don't really like because the sight of Don Vito is nauseating. That man is the most disgusting creature on earth. I had thought of doing some homework but really dont feel like it. So, I said puff it I'll do it tomorrow. I'm really proud of myself because I wrote my sociology paper on Thursday so I didn't have to do it this weekend :) It only had to be 6 pages but it is 8 pages. I need to get a good grade on it. And then I need to get a B on the final...god finals suck. I can't wait until next Wednesday. Other than that, nothing is new. I can't believe this first semester is already coming to an end. Thank God. Although next semester is going to suck just as much...anatomy, chemistry, history, stat, and spanish. And all 8 AMs. Should be lots of fun. Riiiight. Well, I really have nothing else to say so I'm out. <3

I think our janitors are on strike or something. LOL. The bathroom hasn't been cleaned since Monday. That means trash hasn't been emptied, nothing has been wiped down and there's no toilet paper. This is NOT cool. There's toilet paper like all over our floor. I don't understand people. I mean there's only 13 of us sharing this bathroom. One or more of those 13 are so foul. Who leaves toilet paper all over the floor and doesn't flush the toilet? It's so disgusting. I never thought girls would be so gross. Oh well. Um, the weather absolutely sucks today. I was walking to my 9 o clock and it's like raining and the umbrella is pointless becasue the massive force of the wind just knocks it inside out. Puff. I hate the wind. Yay! One of the clustermates decorated our main door. It says like Happy Holidays love 2C and has all these pictures on it. I love it :) I tried to look for decorations but was unsucessful. This week is going by SO f'n slow. I can't believe it's only Wednesday. I have to work tonight. Puff. I'm making progess on my sociology reading! I only have like 75 pages left to read which is awesome.  I got my english paper done! I sat down last night with no intentions of really writing it but I acutally finished it. LOL. So, thats one thing out of the way for this weekend. All I have now is my sociology paper. Next week is all about reading for exams. Should be a wonderful time. But that means less days until Winter Break. I get to come home on Wed. for break because my last exam is on Wednesady @ 8 am. Yay!! Gotta go. Lunchtime with Laney. Talk to you all soon!!

"event","That title subject is dedicated to you, Ashley :) Anyway. It's Sunday and I've been here since oh 12:30? The dorm opened at 12 and the rents drop me off a half hour later...I see how it is, kicking me to the curb. Whatev. So. I went home on Tuesday. Home is awesome. I got home @ like 4 o clock. Then my mom and Ashley and I went to Target and I spent, oh $30? Bought presents for little Deon (my dorm is sponsoring a family for Christmas). And I bought some things for myself...go figure ;) So, then we went to Pizza Hut for dinner. Haven't been there since like August? Then I went home and just hung out with Ashley and watched The Real World and Laguna Beach. It was so long ago I don't even remember what else we did. Ohh, I know. I did some Christmas preparing. Yay! Christmas! So, then Wednesday, Ashley and I woke up and went shopping. We met Brittany Curran for lunch @ Ruby Tuesdays and seh broke the news that the family is moving to Connecticut :( That really depresses me. We've been best friends since like 7th grade and now I will pretty much never see her. We have the holidays and that's about it. Even though she goes to school in Connecticut, I could always look forward to her coming back for breaks but not anymore. Oh well, its better for her because she'll be able to be with her family more often and Mr. Keith will be working right on the CGA campus so that's good for them. But I will REALLY miss Brittany. Her family is like a second family to me. I can go over there and always feel welcome. Now, I'll just have to go to Connecticut...always makes for a good road trip! So, then we all started walking and saw Ms. Snyder! That was exciting. She was definitely one of my favorite teachers...then Ashley and I went shopping for a birthday gift for my dad and she got him a Martini book. Then we headed up to Old Navy to get a pair of clogs that I saw online but they aren't as cute as they looked online so I said puff that, knock that off of my Christmas list. Um. Then? We went to get Ashley's contacts and the fish store but they dont' carry the puffin pump for my fish tank. Um. Then we had to go to PB to get some paper that Ashley needed. Then, Thursday, I woke up and went over my aunt's for Thanksgiving. That was fun. We weren't even there for very long, maybe 3 hours. It just didn't seem the same as other years. Not as many people. I dunno. Then, we went over to my other aunts for like an hour and drove home in Sally. Yay! Then my rents went to OC, I dropped Kae and Cee off, brought Ryan to the liquor store, then went back home and watched TV with Ashley. Very productive. Friday, we went over Joe's house to see Maria, his niece. She's soooooo cute. I took pics. Then, me, Ashley, Kae and Cee headed to OC. Got here, went to Tequila Mockingbird for dinner with the parents. After that, we went to see The Polar Express. Very cute. I would recommend it. Except we went to this piece of shit movie theater in OC. The floor was like stepping on glue, I was afraid of leaning on the seat and contracting lice, so yeah. Other than that, the movie was good. Went to bed woke up at like 10? Went shopping, got some Christmas gifts. Woot! I hate spending money. It seems to just decrease exponentially these days. Can't wait to work over winter break...I need to put in an application still at Damon's. Then we went to the boardwalk and ate and walked around. It's just not the same though as when we walk it in the summer...all the white trash walking around. Oh well. Atleast it wasn't frigid out. Then, we went home and laid around and went to dinner @ some crabcake place. Then, watched even more TV, MTV was playing all of the Life As We Know It episodes so we watched those...then I woke up this morning at the ungodly hour of 930 and showered and got ready to head back to school. As we are driving here my moms car starts to shake and she was getting all flusty. It made it home though so...I got back here at 1230, unpacked and hung up all my Christmas decorations :) I have so much stuff. We're gonna need a U Haul come move out day in May. MUHAHAHA. I don't know where all this stuff comes from. And EWW. I went to go make my bed and there's an f'n spider in my bed. I lift up my comforter and this big black spider comes crawling out. So, I run to my drawer and get out the bug spray and like drown this thing in spray and it continues to move. Im like what the puff? So I just sprayed him some more and eventually he died. Im so proud that I actually killed a spider on my own. LOL. I absolutely hate spiders. I wish they would all just die and rot. They're like my biggest fear. But anywho. Then I went to the Gulls Nest with Jenny for dinner and now I'm back here. My roommate just got back but other than that only two otehr clustermates are here. The campus is all quiet and such. I don't like it. Oh well. I'm gonna get going, take a shower, read a bit then Laney is supposed to pick me up around 11ish to go to Wal Mart...hope we don't get shot. So I'll update later! only 19 days until Winter Break!!"

"event","I don't feel like going to bed so I'm gonna update this instead. So, I went home Friday, and I got home and headed up to Bennigans with the family and as usual it took forever to get our food. Oh well. It was yummy. Then I came home and just hung around the house. Very productive. I had planned to write my history paper but that didn't happen. So, Sat morning I woke up at 5:45, went to the Fryes at 6:45 and we headed to Columbia for the NYC bus trip! It was so much fun even though it rained :( We went all over NYC, saw Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, sooo much. I really want to spend like a week there. It's impossible to visit the city in only a day. Sizens road trip in December!! :) Hopefully. I'll be posting the pics up on my Webshots thing soon so check them out. Um. So, we ate lunch at the Manhattan Chili Company. Very good but kind of expensive, but hey its New York so...Yeah. So we got back home around 11, after our bus had some malfunctions. Boo. But, hey we made it home. I went to bed right after I got home but ate some Cheerios first since I was too poor to afford dinner. No thanks, I refuse to pay $7.50 for a Tuna Salad sandwich. My $5.50 an hour can't pay for that. Then, on Sunday I woke up and thought it was 12:00 because my clock was all puffed up. So I like hurried into the shower and what not because I thought it was late and I had so much to do and I got out of the shower and it was only 11:00. I hate it when that happens but it made my day longer. So, I spent all day Sunday all by myself :( because the family went to Ashley's soccer game. Oh well. I attempted my extra credit history paper but that didn't really happen. I just did my laundry then Lindsay picked me up at 4:15 to head back to SU. We got here around 6:30ish, I ate some dinner and then got back to the paper. As usual, I slacked off and watched Extreme Makeover and Desperate Housewives, then we had a floor meeting @ 10. The boys in the cluster across from me are like so obnoxious, funny but obnoxious. Oh well. So the meeting ended around 10:30, I came back to my room and did some more of the paper unti around 1 am, went to bed, and woke up as usual on Monday mornings at 8:30 for my 9:00 class. Went to that, came back to my dorm and CONTINUED ON THIS STUPID PAPER. Had lunch with Laney, went to English, again continued and FINISHED!! the paper. Went to history, dinner, then work, where two of the machines broke while I was there. oh joy. Finally, the paper was out of the way, read my psych chapter, Laney came over for Battle of the Sexes, and studied a bit for my bio exam tomorrow. SO, there's my exhausting day. Tomorrow, change of plans, I get to go home!!! I've decided just to skip my Wednesday class and go home tomorrow so I will be arriving in the GB around 4:30. Can't wait! I have class, then exam, then pack then departure. We have to do all this gay shit before we leave and actually check off everything and then the RAs inspect our rooms. We have to unplug everything. We're only fone for like 5 days. Ohwell. Well, I am extremely tired. After tomorrow though, 5 mornings of sleeping in! YAY!! See you all soon!!

I called my parents and bitched about my grades and they were like ""as long as you're trying your hardest, we'll be happy"". :) I love my parents. I never thought I would miss them so much. I can't wait to be home for Christmas break! Only 31 more days and I'll be home for 5 weeks. I need to find a job and make some money because I am POOR. I have like $800 in my savings. My $22 a week just isn't cutting it. And Christams is coming up so that's a lot of money. WAHHHHHHH!! Oh well. I can't wait for Christmas. I love it. I love the whole month of December. Chester 2C4 is going to have some mad Christmas decorating. Woot! Oh well. I'm done-watching Nanny 911!

"event","I hate college. I'm dropping out. It's so frustrating when I study for 2 hours for an exam and get a 67%. How does that work out? I study so much more than I ever did in high school, and I have gotten no higher than an 87% on any test. What's the point to even studying? I try so hard and yet I don't do well. I got a 76 on my psych test that I thought I did so well on. I went to the library and studied, then came back to my room and looked over all the chapters again. What a waste of my time. I should just not study and see how well I do. Does anyone else ever get that feeling that they did so well on a test then they get it back and it's not good? I seem to be getting that all the time here. Oh well. There's my venting for the day. Feel free to leave some encouraging comments. I never thought I would miss Old Mill.....WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH."

"event","So, I'll start with Thursday. Alaina and I left here around 2:30, made it home in less than 2 hours. So, I got home and Ashley called and I went and picked her up from driver's ed. I was sure to beep my horn real loud :) So, I brought her and Stephanie home, went home and got changed and what not, then went and got Burnham and Stephanie and we met Jill and Ali at McDonalds for some dinner. Then, we headed up to UMBC for the TSL/YC show! Yay! It was so much fun. We got really good seats. We were like in the third row so the pictures turned out really good. Yay! Everyone and their brother was there at the show. IT was like Old Mill's past and present. Oh well. Heather and Lindsey came from CP so it was fun to see them again. Then, after the concert, we all headed home and I went to sleep a little after one only to wake up the next moring at 6:45 to sign up for classes. Of course, that was hell because SU must have like the worst system for signing up. So, all in all it took me over an hour to sign up for classes because Gullnet was working so unbelievably slow. Go figure. So, I finally signed up and didn't get only one of the classes that I wanted, I got the same time slot just not the teacher I had preferred. Oh well. I'm real mad though because you only choose your lab time, not the lecture time so now I have class @ 12:50 on Friday, which I had planned to be done by 9:50. OH well. Mondays and Wednesdays are going to suck because I'll have class, labs , and work on both days. Puff. But I love my Tuesdays and Thursdays because I'll be done at 10:45 am! Woo hoo!! I only have two classes, from 8-10:45. So thats not too bad because then I'll have my whole day ahead of me to get stuff done. I am def not looking forward to eight o clock classes though :( So, after scheduling I tried to go back to sleep but douldn't so I got up and showered and went to Keely's to get my eyebrows done. Then, I went back home and my mom and I went shopping @ Kohls, the Dolla Store (for cheap Christmas decorations), the mall, and Wal Mart. I spent like over $100 on Friday. I bought my dad Shrek 2 for his birthday and I bought some Christmas presents! Yay!!!! Christmas is just around the corner. I pretty much know what I am going to be getting for everyone. I just hate spending a lot of money so yeah, I'm gonna be cheap. Just kidding. But yesterday I had to write my mom a $221 check which =infinite sadness. So, anyway, after shopping, we picked Ashley up at driver's ed and then went home. And we went to Plaza Garbaldi for dinner. Everyone raves about it so I wanted to try it, and it was really good. Highly recommend it. Then, my mom drove me Chelsea and Ashley to Walgreens to develop pics, and Hollywood video, and Ashley to Panera Bread to turn in her application. So we rented White Chicks and Farenheit 9/11. Then, I went to bed and woke around 11? SOO nice to sleep in. And I ended up going to Ashley's soccer games all day in the bitter cold. But it was nice to spend the day with the family. Then, we got home, and got warm, then headed up to the boys soccer game @ South River with my dad and sister. I got to see all the OM senior kids :) My first game all season! It was so much fun. I met Ashley Bryant and Ali up there and we all sat together in the cold. And the boys won :) 2-1. It was exciting. So, now they go to states ( I think?) sometime this week. I wish I could come home and watch!! Why can't it be on a Friday? So, then after the game I came home and defrosted :) I took a nice hot bath, something I def can't do here at school. And after that me, Ashley, Chelsea, Ryan, and Jenny watched Elf. That movie is so funny. Will Ferrell is my hero. Then I finished watching Farenheit 9/11 and did my 3 loads of laundry. Went to bed around 2 and woke up at 9:30 (eww) and showered and my mom made pancakes for breakfast. Then, before I knew it, it was time to head back to SU. Laney and Lyssy picked me up around 11:45 and we headed to Champ's hockey game. That was really fun, I had never been to a hockey game before. It was violent though. Then, Laney and I headed back to SU where I am now. And, I just made some finsihing touches on my paper and studied for my sociology exam. Then I went to bed early, around 11:45. Woke up and went to take my sociology exam which I think I did pretty well on :) Then, of course, I go to take my CLEP exam and they tell me they can't accept cash. I forgot to get the checks from my mom this weekend, and I only had one left so I wrote one and was gonna pay the other part of it with cash. But, no they wouldnt take it. So, it's 9:51 and my exam is supposed to start at 10. So, I like run back to my dorm and luckily Alex was here and wrote me a check. And, I ran back and got there at like 10:02, and took the test and passed! Yay! So, now I don't have to take English 102. It was actually pretty easy. I need a 50 out of 90 to pass, and I got a 65 so...yeah. Then, I came back to the dorm, called Alaina and went to lunch with her, turned my paper in for english, and she ended class at 1:30 so I finally just relaxed for the first time during the day. But, then I had world civ, the most boring class, which reminds me I still need to write the extra credit paper for. And, I need to finish reading my sociology book (325 pgs) and write a 6 page paper on it. UGHH. Oh well, every day passed means one less day until winter break! I can't wait. SO, yeah, I went to dinner with Lindsay, then to work. Now, I'm here typing this after I finished reading my psych chapter. Check the link on my proile for some pics from the Yellowcard and Starting Line show. Yay! Only 5 days until NYC!!  I can't wait. I wish Ashley was coming :( Boo. Oh well. Have a great week everyone!!"

"event","Today is like one of the best days. First, I had my psych test and think I did really good on it. I studied last night with Jess, a girl from my class, then came back and re read all the chapters. I felt like I really knew it all :) On my way into my psych class, there's a sign on the door that said my next class, anatomy, was cancelled today! I was so happy. So, I finished at 10 am today. Awesome! I can't wait to go home and see everyone (esp ma boo!! LOL). Tonight is the YC/TSL show so taht should definitely be fun. I got the digital ready!! SO, I'm picking Burnham up a little before 5, getting Ashley and Stephanie from Old Mill, picking up Ali, then getting dinner and heading up to UMBC. I'm so excited to be home! I haven't been home since, Oct 24th. It's been a while! I dunno how I survived. Haha. Next week is NYC! Yay!! Then, it's already Thanksgiving break. Next week, I have a sociology exam on Monday, then the CLEP test then I can relax for a while before having more tests. In the past 2 weeks, I've had an exam in every class. It sucks. Ohwell. TOmorrow morning, I gotta get up at like 6:45 to register for classes. Ahh! Then, I'm going to Keely's, possibly up to OM to visit the peer buddies, then shopping with my momma! Can't wait! Have a great weekend everyone!!

"event","So it's finally Sunday. That means only 4 days until I get to go home. Yay!!! So, today I woke up at 12. Ahh! Didn't want to sleep that late but it felt soooooo good. So, I woke up, showered real quick and went to the Commons w/ Lindsay around 1:15 then finally I went to the library. And...Finished my research paper!!! I'm such a procrastinator but I finally did it. I went to the library a bit before 2 and didn't leave until after 5. But I finished it! I actually think it's pretty decent. However, my blind English teacher probably will think it's pretty shitty. I always think I do pretty well but NO she think it's only ""B"" material. Puff. Oh well. At least I'm not failing. So, this week is going to be forever. I have my world civ readings exam on Monday, World Civ exam on Wednesday, and Psych exam on Thursday. Then, on Monday the 15th, I have exam @ 9 am, CLEP test @ 10 am, and a paper due @ 1- the paper I did today. After that, I need to start reading my Sociology book that I have to write a paper on by Dec. 6th. My life is so busy! It sucks. If I wasn't such a procrastinator, I wouldn't be so far behind but...Yeah. So, Thursday we had a cluster meeting because apparently there is a lot of ""tension"" in our cluster. It was all about someone having sex in the shower, someone else writing ""stop fucking in the shower"" on the bathroom mirror, then someone else writing ""fuck you"" on another's doors. What nice girls I live with! Haha. But, after the meeting, our RA suggested we keep our doors open and try to get to know each other. I already know Whitney, that's about it of my cluster mates. But, I actually hung out in Bri's room and saw her fish...4 of which have died already. LOL. And Whitney borrowed my Yellowcard CD's. And we got a new clustermate, Julia. She's pretty nice but she alwasy has people over and is pretty loud. Oh well. It's cool. So, yeah, that was my weekend. My dad is coming tomorrow! I'm so excited. I haven't seen him in over 2 weeks! Yay!! So, I'll update later. Thursday is the YC/TSL show!! It feels like so long ago Cee was asking me if I wanted to go. Can't wait to be with my sizens!! Have a great week!!

Mon-Wed always suck so yeah. On Tues, Courtney told me she is transferring next semester :( So no more UP with her next year. Gotta find some new plans. Also, I had my lab test on Tuesday. I think I did pretty good :) I hope I did anyway. Oh well. Thursday, I went to the library and did some research for my paper. My paper that I am still not sure yet what I'm writing about and yet it is due in about a week. I'm such a procrastinator. It's really bad. I have an exam in World Civ on Monday and I need to do start doing the readings that we're tested on. I've had since the beginning of October to do these but go figure I haven't started yet. Hopefully, it won't take me that long and I can finish all of it today. Then have all day tomorrow to work on my paper. I wanna be finished with my paper tomorrow. Yah, so hopefully the readings won't take too long :) So, last night Lindsay, Jenny and I went to the Gulls Nest for dinner. Yumm. The Commons food is just getting...old. I dunno? So, then I came back to the dorms and started my world civ review, watched 8 simple rules, then headed upstairs and hung out with Lindsay. Then, we went into Jenny's room for a bit. Came back to my room around 12:30 or so and continued my world civ review. Homework on a Friday night! WOO HOO!! I need to get it done though. So, I woke up around 11 :) I LOVE sleeping in. I ate some cheerios and orange juice that we bought last night at the Gulls Nest :) And, I finished my review, showered, washed my dishes, blow dried my hair, ate some crackers, cleaned up a bit, and now I'm sitting here typing this. Niki is gone for the weekend, so I have the room to myself. That should give me more motivation to do work b/c I know she won't be in here. But, obviously, I haven't done much. So yeah, I'm gonna go do that now. Next weekend, I'm going home, weekend after NYC!! And my dad is coming on Monday night :) Can't wait! And on Thursday, Yellowcard/TSL show!! So, have a great weekend!!

"event","SO, lets see. Friday, the first Friday I've been here since like the beginning of September (MUHAHAHA), I just relaxed then went to the commons and then Lindsay and I just watched movies. Very exciting. LOL. What can I say? We're party animals. So, Saturday I woke up at 11. I LOVE sleeping in :) And showered and all that jazz, and then Alaina called and asked if I wanted to help her shop for a Halloween costume so I said sure, why not. So, we went to 86986948693 stores. And ended up at Target for the goods. Then, we headed over to Wal Mart and got Mike a doctor's costume. Dr. Feel Good! Yes, so then Laney, me and Lindsay went to the Commons for dinner. MMMMM Alfredo. Then, we headed back to the dorms and at the last minute decided to go to a COSTUME PARTY! over in Cynthia's place. I must say, that was a good last minute decision. So, we took Laney's suggestion and were cowgirls. I wore my pink plaid shirt, with some boots and borrowed a cowgirl hat from my clustermate, Emily. Thenn, we headed over to Laney's while she got ready. We got over to the party and it was ridiculous. There were so many f'in people. It was unbelieveable. As Heather said about her UMD party, it was like something out of a movie. So, yeah I had 8 shots and like 3 beers? Big mistake. LOL. I mean it was fun but I was hurting this morning. Yeah, so after like 8 shots within like an hour or so, we headed outside? I think. Then, eventually we made it over to one of Alaina's coworkers house where Mike and I were a team for beer pong. Then, I saw Connie and we decided to head back to campus with the drunk. LOL. There was  some boy that jumped off of the building. And of course, we watched him. Riiiiight. So, we made it back, walking right past the RA's. LOL. And I went to bed at 3:15ish and woke up at puffin 9:30. I never wake up at 9:30 on the weekends! So I only got like 6 hours of sleep. Yeah, so I got up early, showered, went to do my laundry but NO the puffin thing says ""cash only"" and yet theres no place for cash. SO, I haven't done my laundry yet. Yeah, so then Niki came back and I met her grandparents and they were really nice. I put up this awesome collage in my room. Theres like 30 pics on it. It's soooooo cute. And I bought some Christmas lights for around my closet. But they're going to be year-round lights because they're cute. Yes, so thats it. That was my weekend. Hope you're impressed. GOD, I wish I would have done some homework..."

"event","GOD. I fucking hate my anatomy teacher. He's such an asshole. I just went to his office because I just wanted to see how many questions I got wrong on the test, because he has them posted up by his office. So, I went over all my answers or whatever and he was in his office so I simply asked ""I was just curious how you figure out the grade"" and he's like ""didn't you pay attention in class?"" I was just like omg, can we be more of an asshole? Isn't a teacher supposed to TEACH you? Apparently not. I'm sorry for asking a question even though it says in the syllabus to come to his office and ask questions. Well, I will never do that again. I went to him right after class to ask if I could see the key and it was sitting right in front of me and he says ""Can't you wait until its posted on my office?"" I HATE THAT MAN. With that being said, school sucks. I thought I did good on my weekly psych quiz but no, you don't put one key word and get the whole thing wrong. College sucks. I studied for my anatomy test for like 2 hours and still got a 70% with a 9 point curve. Yeah, do that math. I pretty much failed. Maybe I'm not college material. MAYBE I should just drop out and say fuck it all and work at McDonald's for the rest of my life. UGH. ANYWHO. Today's my early today. Got done at 12:15, went to lunch with Court, Shannon, Leanne, Lindsey, and Wyatt. Then came back here and went and got my test and headed over to talk to my teacher. I had work last night. BLAH. I got my second paycheck - $44. I still don't think I was paid for enough hours on my last paycheck. I should have been paid for 20 hours but got paid for 16.5. Yes so. Whatever. Tuesday, I had lab. Same stupid anatomy teacher. It's such a waste of time. We have to know every muscle and bone in the upper body. Then, we are quizzed on it. I bought an anatomy coloring book. Hopefully that will help. I really need to do good. Ok, well I dunno what else to say and this is kind of boring. I need a nap."

Yeah. Today is Monday. Blah! I hate Mondays. So, I got back to SU around midnightish last night. Corey brought me back, with Jami. So, I got home Friday around 5ish and went to Famous Dave's in Annapolis with my family. I got myself a cheesburger. It wasn't anything great. So, then we went home and Ashley and Chelsea and I drove the Expedition up to Hollywood Video and rented A Cinderella Story and The Girl Next Door. The Girl Next Door was not that good, I thought it would be funnier. So, after that I took a shower and was like Gross! (as Napolean would say) and at one o clock in the morning, I'm putting up a new shower liner. Ryan and Ashley DO NOT know how to clean. It's pretty sad that I come home from college and clean their bathroom for them. I hate not having my TV in my room anymore b/c it's here. There's like nothing to do in my room anymore- no TV, no computer, no good CD's. OH well. Yeah, so I went to bed and woke up Saturday morning at like 11ish? I dunno. So, I showered ( I know, big surprise, huh?) and Ashley I went to the bank and deposited my 90 dolla paycheck and Ali was my teller :), then we got lunch and went to Wal Mart, Target, and Walgreens. I bought an awesome lava lamp at Target. Yay! And I bought other stuff to bring back to school and a snow hat @ Target for only $2.49! Yes, so then I came home and lounged around and went over to Chelsea's to see her looking all sexy before Homecoming. LOL. Which reminds me I need to upload my pics from this weekend. Um, yeah so then Burnham and Ali picked me up and we went to Bill Bateman's but it was an hour wait so we went to the sex store. WOW. LOL. That was an interesting experience. Burnham's gay friend works there and he was very open in explaining everything to us. I was just like OMG I think I can figure it out on my own. That store was definitely different. LOL. Plastic penises EVERYWHERE. I could never work there, people come and shop in all seriousness and we're there for a laugh. Like, this white trashy woman came in and was like looking for something because she said her boyfriend(?) could get it hard but couldn't keep it hard and I was just like oh my god, do you really need to announce that to the whole store? So our Tour Guide, haha, like went and showed her all these different things and was explaining them I was just like wow, definitely could not work here. I took pictures of Burnham and Ali in the store. LOL. There were some things that quite honestly scared me. Like umm anal beads. Yeah, who in their right mind would use those? I believe our tour guide did (does)? FOUL. But it was fun, to say the least. Yeah, so then we went back to Bill Bateman's which was really good then back to Burnham's to look at pictures from effin JUNE. Because every time I would ask her to see them she'd forget or something. WHATEVER BURNHAM. Yeah, so I looked at those and they went to Na's but I went home to do laundry. SOOOOO, I went to bed Saturday at 2ish? And woke up at puffin 1 o clock in the afternoon. That definitely calls for a Napolean UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I cleaned my fish tank, those poor things were not even visible in the water :( and then visited my grandmother and saw my 3 year old cousin Jakob who I haven't seen since last Christmas! He is soo cute! Yeah, so then I came home, cleaned my room, did some homework and laundry. And I had dinner with my family :) LOL. My dad told me I made the dinner table loud. HAHA. So, after that I watched American Dreams with Ashley and my mom and started to watch Desperate Housewives but Jami called around 9:30ish and said we were leaving so I put my stuff in the car and met them at Royal Farms and said goodbye to my family :( I won't be home for another 2 weekends. I know, I can't believe it either...next time I go home I'll be going to the YC/TSL show Nov. 11th! Yay!! I'm acutally kind of excited to spend a weekend down here. Yes, so now I'm here, just got out of English like half hour ago and I have world civ in 10 mins. Eww. I hate that class with a passion. So I gotta go. I have to study tonight for a bio test tomorrow. AHHHH!!! Pray for me! TTYL. <3"

"event","I just got back from my sociology class. I hate having early classes. But I like getting them over with so...I'm going to try and get my classes over early next semester. And try for like a really early class on Friday so I can go home early on weekends that I go home :) Yeah, so when did I last update? Tuesday? So, I had work on Wednesday. BLAH! It went soooooooo slow. A lot of people I know came in though so that was cool. Then, yesterday, done at 12:15! I love it.  So, I ate lunch with all the girls. Then, checked my mail and got two things! I got a CD ( created by Ashley :) ) and a birthday card from BRITTANY CURRAN! So, I came back, and cleaned this room. My rug gets so dirty so I had to like hand pick all the fuzz off. LOL. Yeah, I guess you could say neat freakish. Then, Lindsay and I walked over to find about the CLEP test and signed up for it. So hopefully I will pass and won't have to take English 102, which is lit, next semester. I do not have time to read books. If I don't pass, I'll feel stupid because this girl Jessica in my psych class said that 9 out of 10 people pass. So I'll be proudly representing that 1 out of 10. NOT. And, then I came back and read stupid chapter 25 for my stupid english midterm which my stupid teacher said we have to cite from. How am I supposed to cite without the book in front of me? Puff that. Yes, then I watched Room Raiders (my guilty, guilty pleasure) even though Cee calls it trashy. LOL. Then I went with Lindsay to the Gulls Nest for dinner and we were supposed to go see the play, Noises Off, on campus but I thought it was free but it turns out $8. And I definitely can't afford that with my $5.50 an hour. So, we saw Alaina ( and Nick) in the Gulls Nest. Then, I came back and just relaxed. Watched TV. Some Extreme Makeover, Life As We Know It, and True Life-but that was a stupid episode. Thennnn, I watched the rest of the baseball game. Yay Cardinals. But even more Yay for the Red Sox! Yeah Burnham-Yankees SUCK! So, I'm going home today :) Alaina's bringing me home, and Jami. And tomorrow is Ali's b-day celebration! Woot! Dinner? Dunno yet but sex shop. Hell yeah. LOL. I am SO bringing my camera. Well, as exciting as this is, I dunno what else to say sooo. I'm out. GB here I come!"

"event","Well it's Tuesday! I hate Tuesdays. Today, my lab class actually lasted for like the whole time-we only got out 10 mins early. I thought I was going to die of boredom. Womack didn't let us out early in lecture either...hmm. I just got back from dinner w/ Lindsay and then like everyone else was there. And we went to get Bistro ice cream but NOOO , no mint chocolate chip. PUff that! Oh well. So, I had a psych exam today. I definitely should have studied more. Although, some of the questions that were on there, we definitely never went over. I hate when teachers do that. Like, how are we supposed to know the information if we aren't taught/read it? UGHH. I don't think I will be getting any A's this semester which is really sad. I have never not gotten an A on a report card. Welcome to college! So, anyway. I had breakfast this morning with one of my clustermates! I was sitting there by myself, and she came over and asked to sit with me. It's the first cluster-mate of mine that I've actually had a conversation with. Haha. She's really nice. So, then I took my psych test, had about 40 mins to spare, came back to my dorm, made my bed, watched TV and what not. Then, bio lecture. eww. Then, I went to lunch with Meghan and Leanne. And I should have come back and read for a little bit but I didn't. Go figure. Yeah, so now I'm here. Writing this and watching That's So Raven--waiting for One Tree Hill and The Real World to come on! So, I'm going home this weekend. for ALI'S BIRTHDAY! Then, I will be here for two weekends in a row. Can you believe it?! Haha. I need to go out to a party. LOL. Okay. Well I dunno what else to say. Except that tomorrow is Wednesday! Yay! Then after that it will be home free (almost).

"event","So, the weekend started out good. On Friday, my english class was only 10 minutes long :) so I took a nap and then my parents got here around 4 o clock ish. So, then we headed to OC and just kind of lounged around until 5:30ish and then we went to Tequila Mockingbird!! YUMMM. And I got tacos and corn fries...my favorite! Then, we went back to Lazy Days, and I watched Mean Girls with my mom and Auntie Alice and Auntie Alice gave me this awesome Halloween bag with candy and a card AND my Cee's school picture. Yay! It's now proudly hanging on my desk :) So, after Mean Girls, my mom and dad went to bed and then I'm sitting there all alone and I hear this knock on the door. And I'm always paranoid so I'm like I dunno if I should answer it. But, I do and it's my cousin Sharon. Haha. SO, then Saturday morning I am awoken at like 10:05. And I shower, eat breakfast, and then my mom and I and Auntie Alice went to Sunshine Wicker and I bought some Halloween decorations for my room and a snowman thing and this awesome beach thing that says ""RELAX"". THen, we went to the OC outlets and I got a pair of TILT jeans, a GAP hoodie, and some clog/boot things. :) It was a happy day of shopping. Then, we went back to Lazy Days and hung around with Aunt Patty, her mom, Alaina and Alyssa. THENNN, I helped my mom squirt down the outside chairs. After that, we sat around for a bit, went to Home Depot, Wal-Mart (with no luck of finding decorative lights. GRR!!). We went to some bar place called The Wedge for dinner. However, since it was a bar, we were sitting next to this drunk, loud ass lady and I was just like OMG please be quiet so I can't say we really had an enjoyable setting. Oh well, it's a bar. Then, we just went back and watched Trading Spaces for like three hours. Yeah, that's how I spend my Saturday nights, try to not be jealous! Sunday morning I am woken up at 9:30 (NOT COOL) and we clean and there was so much puffin dust. My dad seriously sneezed like 20 times in 20 minutes. And then my eyes were getting red and I could not breathe. It was awful. SO, they had their Condo Assocation meeting, for two hours, while I sat and watched repeats of MTV shows. Then, they bring me back to SU and all hell starts. LOL. First, I go to the laundry room and there is not an open washer until the sixth time that I go down. SO, I finally find a washer and I'm in such a rush b/c I was on my way to dinner and this girl who I had previously seen in the laundry room told me that I could have her washer, so I run up and get my clothes and put them in and what not and I go up to my room where Lindsay was waiting and I'm like OMG where's my Gull Card? She runs down to the laundry room to look, I look through my laundry basket and I can't find it. So she's like well, we can order a pizza and then wait for your clothes to be done to see if you would have put it in with your clothes accidently. Then, she's like is it in the other part of your wallet thing? SURE ENOUGH, there it was. Thank God. So, we go to the Commons, there's not much to choose from and I come back and get in the shower. As I am in the shower, the lights go out! So, I'm in the shower and it is pitch black. I can't see a single thing but I had to finish showering so I did, in the dark, can't find my towel, I'm like feeling around, hit my puffin head on the shower door. And they are still out right now. Today was not my day! So, now I am sitting here watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and then Desperate Housewives while my white clothes are drying. Then, the week starts. And I have to work tomorrow! Grr! Oh well. I also have to study b/c I have a puffin psych test on Tuesday. Let midterm week begin! Burnham's picking me up on Friday! Yay!! And we're going out for Ali's b-day? Ohhhh yeah. I can't wait. Haha! Okay, I am going to get going. Bye!!

We went, turned our papers in, she told us what we were doing next week and then said to have a good weekend. Sweet! That's what I love about college- professors can cancel class if they want and let us out early. No stupid high school bell schedule :) Haha. So, my parents are coming down today! Yay! They should be here around 3ish and then we're going to OC for the weekend. My Uncle Jack and Auntie Alice will be there too and tomorrow, Alaina, Alyssa, Aunt Patty and her mother are stopping by. So it should be fun. Apparently we are going to Outback tonight. YUMMM. My dad said he wants to go to Tequila Mockingbird so hopefully tomorrow we can go there. I want to go to Wal Mart and get some lights to put up in my room. Like string lights, I dunno. It would be cute. I got mail yesterday :) My mom sent me a Halloween card and reminded me of when were little and we would all get dressed up and my dad and Uncle Jack would take all 6 of us kids around Fox Chase...those were the good old  days. It was so hot in our room earlier today. I swear I was like sitting here sweating. I dunno, maybe I am getting sick? So, I opened the window, even though it's raining. Well I am going to take a nap before my parents get here. Have a good weekend everyone!!

I was expecting like 50 bucks but hey I'll take $90 :) Too bad it's going right to the bank so that I won't spend it. I need to start saving for Christmas presents!! Christmas is like 2 and a half months away. I'm so excited. There is nothing on TV right now, which is part of why I'm updating this- I'm bored. I'm watching the Presidential Debates right now. By the way, VOTE FOR BUSH! All of you who can should vote! I got my sociology test back today which I thought I did pretty well on but NO. I got a 76%. So much for studying. I was telling my dad today how I didn't think I would be getting any A's on my report card and he said ""as long as you're trying your best"". I love my Dad. I only talk to him like once a week because he goes to sleep at like 8 o clock. Hopefully once soccer season is over he'll won't be waking up at 4 AM every single day :( My mom used to e-mail me everyday but she hasn't in 2 weeks :( It's really depressing. I dunno but I love hearing from my parents. Ashley makes fun of my mom for telling me like what they are having for dinner and what not but I enjoy hearing things like that. Like tonight, Ashley said they were having tacos for dinner. YUmm. My favorite. I love tacos @ home. They are so much better than the ones in the Commons. Then, they all went to Brandon's soccer game. We never went to soccer games when I was home.  When I was home I used to say that I couldn't wait to leave. I dunno what I was thinking. LOL. Home is home. Home is where I'm myself and I'm most comfortable. I mean don't get me wrong, I actually really like my dorm room, but I love being able to sit on a couch and watch TV, not in my bed or a desk chair. OH well. I can do in next year when we're living in UP. WOoot Woot! (as Kae says). I'm gonna go watch Made. See ya!

Like atleast 6 questions today, I had never seen the diagrams in my life. Joy. And, I had my textbook out right before we took the test just looking at muscles one last time and he like scolded me. I was like Gee I'm sorry for studying for a test. I can't stand that man. I got an 82% on his lecture test. So, I'm keeping a decent grade I just don't like him too much. Oh well. Only two more months. I finally got all of my work done for the week. I finished my paper this afternoon so I had my whole night free.I think it might be the worst paper that I have ever written. How much can you write on the issue of privacy AND have to cite 5 different sources?! My last paper that I thought I did so well on was only a B. I am trying to test out of English 102 so I won't have to take it next semester. 102 is Literature and I despise reading so hopefully I can CLEP out, I guess that's how you spell it?  So I cleaned my desk and what not. Exciting, huh? So, I got mail yesterday!! :) I got a card and newspaper article about nurses from my mom, a cute mouse pad from Bee, and my absentee ballot. VOTE FOR BUSH! Feel free to send me mail! My campus address is on my profile :) When I came back from my class this morning, our room was so clean! It looks so nice now. I've done some redecorating over the days. I decorated our door with Halloween decorations. It looks so cute! It has a glow in the dark 3 ft skeleton, and a pumpkin with streamers coming off of it and a bunch of other sparkly and orange pumpkins. All courtesy of the Dolla Store. Haha. Speaking of dollar stores, it reminds me of the fact that my car is completely infested with spiders. Yes, Sally is not happy. Me, Ashley and Chelsea were driving around to Walgreens and the gas station Friday night and there were 3 spiders, one with an egg sac in my car. We were like screaming our heads off going 50 down Veterans trying to make it as quick as possible to the gas station so we could get out. LOL. It was so funny. Then, the next morning I went to go spray my car with Raid and another one came out. THEN, Ashley and I were @ the Dollar Store getting Halloween decorations and we get in and Ashley starts screaming because there is one on the door so she like drowns the thing in Raid. I hate spiders, they are like my biggest fear and yet they are taking over my car. Infinite sadness!! Haha. Can you believe that Thanksgiving is next month? I can't wait for Winter Break. I need a job so I can actually make some money. I get my first paycheck tomorrow!! Yay!! I haven't been paid since I started working back in August. And yet it will still only be like 60 dollars, if that. LOL. Oh well. Money is money. Courtney left today to go see Pat. It seems like just yesterday that she was saying like 6 weeks or whatever it was. I can't believe it's already mid-October. I don't understand this LagunaBeach show. Is it real or staged? I'm so confused. Well I can't think of anymore to say at this moment. As Lindsay said on her Xanga, let me know if you read this. Maybe I'm just writing to myself? Haha. Let me know! Have a great night!!

That's probably not too good. Haha. The matching we had was extremely easy, so hopefully that will make up for the ones I got wrong since Womack gives us a pretty decent curve. Yesterday was never ending as usual, I hate Mondays through Wednesdays because the days are always so long. Today I have a lot to do though unfortunately- I have to start my english paper, read 50 pages of sociology, study for sociology, concert committee meeting and Life As We Know It starts tonight! Yay! And True Life comes on tonight. Tomorrow, I am going home (yes, again) :) I love being home, everything is so familiar and comfortable. Even though SU is getting better , I still think I'd rather be home. I can't wait until next year when I don't have to live in a dorm room. From what I understand, me, Courtney, Erin and Lindsey are supposed to live in UP next year so that will be awesome. UP has really nice apartments. It will be so much homier. We can have a Christmas tree! Haha. So, hopefully all of that will work out. I like how we had a mandatory cluster meeting last night and like half of the people were there. I felt so bad, I kept it in my mind all day then come 9:00 I'm online and watching TV and completely forget about it until Bri from across the hall comes and gets me. Christmas is less than three months away! Yes!! And like what 6 weeks of winter break? Awesome. Today Burnham told me that she would come and pick me up for the weekend of October 23. Such a good friend :) Okay! Gotta go. Lunch time!!

Now thats exactly what I like to watch before going to dinner. So, I did bad on my psych quiz, go figure. I really need to do homework BEFORE watching TV because then I don't concentrate and get interested in TV and dont' end up studying. So, Real World is on tonight! Annd One Tree Hill! It was sooo cold out today. I love it. I can't wait to wear my winter coat and hat and gloves. My lips are so chapped from walking around in the cold today. Nothing else is new really, same old same old. I have a bio test on Thursday. So that's just super. I started to make flashcards today but got bored with it. Go figure. Jounals must be the cool thing to do now because I swear everyone has one. They're fun to read though. So whatev. We just had a fire drill. Definitely took the time to throw on some clothes-I had on shorts and a shirt, def not going out in that. That would really suck if that fire drill had been an hour ago when I was in the shower. OMG. Can you imagine? I'd cry. Okay, I'm going to go and attempt to hang up a picture frame.

Then, I drove up to the soccer field, hoping to see Marla but Varsity ended early so I didn't see her. So I went home and we went to Rocky Run for dinner. YUMM. After that I called Ali and Burnham but I guess they don't like me enough to hang out with me because they like work better. Whatever! So I spent my Friday night doing laundry. Then, on Saturday Steph did my hair and we went to the wedding. It was so much fun! The ceremony started 30 mins late, puff that. But, then we went to the reception. They had so much food. Alfredo was yummmm. And we stayed there until almost midnight-record time for my parents, I don't think they've ever stayed out that late ;) Then, I went home and had to do more laundry. Sunday- I woke up, went to Wal Mart and Giant with my mom and then met Court back up at Old Navy and came back to SU. And found a fucking chicken tender in my bed. That was just awesome. I mean who eats in someone else's bed and leaves it there? I just love being respected. It feels so nice. And, I have a puffin world civ exam which I still need to study for. I hate world civ. I liked my teacher up until this point-he's really anal about tests. And I think I get my english paper back today-finally. However, I am really scared about what I got because my teacher says that she considers a ""C"" to be really good and I'm like huh? I consider that bad. So, yeah. And these next two weeks are going to suck. I have a world civ exam, bio exam, bio lab exam, sociology exam, paper due, psych paper due...and the list goes on. Someone save me. Okay, I really need to study-

We'll see how much that really pays off though :/ I am so tired and sick and can't wait to go home tomorrow. Today, there was a sign on our bathroom door that said something like ""13 girls share this bathroom, so no sex in the shower!"". Haha, then like a few hours later another sign says ""who had sex in the shower? we really wanna know"". Good old dorm life. Nice clean showers that we get to use here. And, yes, I just used it even though it hasn't been cleaned since this morning. GROSSSSSS. So, anyway. Tomorrow I have sociology and then english and Courtney says we're leaving @ 2 to go back to GB! I love GB. And then on Saturday is Michael and Michelle's wedding. Yay! Get to get all dressed up...then before you know it, it will be Sunday, and I'll be back here and won't be home for a few weeks :( Ohwell, get to experience the SU night life :) Okay, I'm bored so you must be too b/c you're reading this.

I hope it doesn't continue all week and definitely not on Saturday @ the wedding. I got my psych test back today- I studied for two and a half hours and only got an 80%. Ughh. Then, I got my bio lab test back-78%. That's not looking too promising. So, now I am watching One Tree Hill. :) MY THROAT HURTS SO BAD. I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna go get in bed and be warm and watch One Tree Hill, Real World and then Laguana Beach. Sorry, this is boring."

"event","I went home this weekend :) For my birthday. So we left here on Friday around 3 o clock ish. Mrs Donna picked us up and we got home around 5. Then I went up to the daycare and saw all my little kids. In just 5 weeks I felt like they've all gotten so much older and I realized that even though I complained about my job all the time, I really did like it. Then, I went home and we went over to the Frye's for crabs. However, Chelsea and I went to McDonald's/Quiznos. Then, Saturday morning (my birthday!) I made peanut butter/chocolate chip pancakes. Yumm! Then, Ashley and I met Alyssa at Pizza Hut. After that, I got my haircut. Thennn, for dinner my mom and I went up to Bennigans early, thinking it was going to be crowded but it wasn't and yet we still had to wait an hour and twenty mins. So I had grilled cheese, LOL, and the staff came and sang Happy Birthday, thanks to Bee. Then, we went back to my house and I opened all of my wonderful presents. I got...
-Pullover, Sweater, 2 Pairs of PJ pants, pens, notepad, and Mean Girls from my mom and dad
-A belt, pic frame, mirror, and change purse from Ashley
-Money with an awesome card from Ryan and Jenny
-PJ pants, a notecard set,socks, and money from Auntie Alice and Uncle Jack
-A cute Piggy Bank and another awesome card from Bee
- The Worse Case Scenario Survival Handbook: College (book) and lottery tickets ($2 dolla winner!) from Kae
-Libra makeup bag with lip gloss, pony tails, and lotion, and a pic frame from Cee
-Money from Nan and Grammie
*hope I didn't get forget anything*
Then, we had ice cream cake and mint choc chip frosting cake. Yumm! And I woke up Sunday at 11ish. Went to Arundel Mills with my mom and got a sweater, socks, and $4.00 backpack at Old Navy. And of couse Bed Bath and Beyond didn't have the organzier that I wanted. Puff Bed Bath and Beyond. Then, my mom treated me to Coldstone Creamery icecream and we went home, went to Home Depot with my dad to look for a shelf, didn't find one. Came home, watched TV, ate tacos then came here back to SU. Now, here it is 12:18 am and I am really tired so I'm heading out. GOodnight. I think this is my longest entry yet. :)"

My boo is currently shopping for my b-day gifts as I write this! So today I had my psych test which I studied like 2 hours for. I think I did okay, I hope I did! I just vacuumed my rug and you can't even tell. It still looks really dirty. I really want to get a new cell phone-my battery keeps dying and it only lasts for like less than 2 days. And now I am watching Survivor and these men trying to make fire. PSHHH. Tonight we had a SOAP concert committee meeting and there was like no one there. I think there were 5 of us? Last week there was like 15ish. Now I am listening to Laney's radio show but I'm hearing SILENCE. Haha. I requested a song but it seems to not be found. Last time I listened to the radio show I was at home in my basement. WAAAAAHHHH. Oh well. I'm starting to like it here. I haven't been to a show in FOREVER. Since we saw Brand New in April. Wow. I'm hoping to go to the TSL/Yellowcard show at UMBC in November. AND the HRC show in November, hopefully we can make the guest list :) What happened to the cold weather that we had Monday? Why is it hot again? It needs to be cold so I can wear hoodies and boots. YAY!! Okay, I'm bored so you must be too.

Not that you care, although if you are reading my journal, you must have some time on your hands ;) I have english at one o clock-with my blind professor. I finished my paper this morning and we're supposed to turn them in on Friday. So I have english, world civ, and then work. Sometime between that, dinner. And then back here to study for my psychology test that I have tomorrow. I had two bio tests yesterday that were much easier than I thought they would be. I think I did okay, no less than a B. The other night some boy came in to my dorm room in a loin cloth. That was interesting to say the least. And now I am watching the news and they announced that the other American hostage has been beheaded in Iraq which is absolutely horrible and inhumane but that's a whole another subject that I won't bore you with. But they showed the man's brother pleading for him to be released. Very sad. Okay I really have nothing else to say so I'm gonna go. Oh wait...
My birthday is in 3 days :)

Kae, Cee, and Ashley came down for the weekend :) Friday night they got here around 8:30ish and we went to Tia's for dinner with Alaina and Mike. Then, we headed to OC. We got to OC like 11 ish and went to bed. Then,we woke up @ 11 and had some choc/pb chip pancakes. YUMMMM. Then, we headed out to Wal Mart where I saw Coach Bunting and Maggie and talked to her for a brief moment and I spent $25. Thenn,we headed to the outlets and although I was very tempted, I spent no money. Then we went to the boardwalk and got Shenanigans for dinner. For the rest of the night, we hung out at Lazy Days and watched the Babysitters Club, old school huh? It was fun though. Then, Carey came over and we all hung out for a bit. Then, we went to bed early because we had to wake up at like 6:45 in the am. eww. So I got back @ SU at like 8:30ish this morning and slept in until 11. Then showered, went to the commons by myself :( and did some studying. Now, I am here in this place I'm supposed to call ""home"". PSHH. never will be. well im gonna go do some reading

Sooo, I woke up, showered, went to breakfast, then psych and got a 100% on my chapter quiz! Then went to Bio and took a practice exam and felt relieved because I don't think the actual exam will be too hard. Then, I had my lab but Womack let us out at like 5:20ish? Pretty much everyone left at like 5 when he stepped out for a minute so there was like 4 kids left? But I stayed because I would have felt bad for leaving, the man only stepped out for a paper in his office and everyone left :( But, being the good student that I am, I stayed. So, after lab I came back and watched Boy Meets World which will no longer come on at 5:00 b/c stupid Gilmore Girls will starting Oct. 4th. UGHHHHHH. Thennnn, I went to the Commons for dinner with the usual, checked my mail and STILL NO CONTACT CASE. Tell me why it takes a week for an envelope to get here. Then, I took a shower in the one inch by one inch square Salisbury University likes to call a shower. And eventually I will blow dry my hair and go to Choptank to watch THE REAL WORLD :)

We went to Party on the Plaza and watched Hot Rod Circuit play :) Then, the lead singer was just standing there so I went and talked to him and he took a picture with me and signed my new CD. Woo hoo! Then we all went over to UP for a while, played some beer pong. I don't think I can ever break my 10-1 record though with Ryan. Puff that. Then, Alaina calls me and tells me that ANDY (singer of HRC) gave her his cell phone number and told him to call him later, and I got all excited because I thought we were hanging out with him, but we didnt. OH well, gotta wait until November! So then I came back to Chester, went to bed around 2:30ish and woke up at 11:15 when my BOO called and told me about Michael Phelps and how she got to see him in person. She sent me some HOT pics. :) Then I went to SU football game which they prob won- halftime score was 31-7? Then I read and I am going to dinner soon at the Commons. YUMM. I dunno yet whats on the agenda for tonight?

Once my ASAP class is over next Thursday, I get to sleep in until like 8:45 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. No more 8 AM! This time in two weeks I will be saying ""Yay! I'm going home tomorrow"" and in one week ""Yay! My sizens are coming tomorrow."" It gives me much to look forward to. Then, the wedding of Michael and Michelle- get to get all dressed up. Hot Rod Circuit is playing tomorrow @ Party on the Plaza, I am tempted to go. Hmmm...Tonight is the SOAP meeting for concerts. I wanna do concerts so I can go backstage and meet the bands :) Yeahhhh.

We had a party for Ryan's 21st on Sunday, got to see the family :) I definitely did not want to come back and of course I cried before I left. Oh well. I know I am not the only one! So for the first time, I had breakfast, lunch, and dinner today. YUM. Commons food is really good actually. My classes today felt like they would NEVER end. I was supposed to have a lab today but had to go to gay convocation and therefore I have to go to the lab on Thursday w/ Leanne. My one day that I am supposed to be done early- at 12:15 :( Oh well, it's only this week. I was sooooo tired when I woke up this morning. I've decided to do the whole showering at night thing and it's so much better. I can blow dry my hair AND sleep in later. I woke up today at 7:20, like almost an hour later then I normally would so that is AWESOME. And I finally have cable TV. Something I have been deprived of for over a week! It's a whole new life ;) I went to return my book today because WOMACK said I didn't need it and of course they said I need an original receipt which I know I never got, therefore I have to go back tomorrow and do it. There's nothing like waiting until the last minute...Well, I have a peer buddy meeting tonight @ 7, SOAP @ 8 and then THE REAL WORLD! starts at 10, watching it over in Choptank. I'll update later...

And she just dropped me off, which made me sad even though she'll be picking me up tomorrow. I don't even want to think about coming back on Monday when I dunno when I will see my family next for sure. I am so homesick. I wish I was home so bad. I know it's such an adjustment but it's so much harder than I thought it would be.I mean I know it will take getting used to, but I dont know if I could ever really get used to it to a point where I am happier than if I were at home. But I am giving it time... It's only 8:50 but I am tempted to go bed, I'm so tired. The sooner I fall asleep, the sooner tomorrow will come and the sooner I will be home :)"

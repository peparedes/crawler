"event","sorry i havent updated in awhile..well what can i say ive had an awesome weekend and things since my last entry are better than i ever could have imagined.  Musical went awesome, happy to meet some new kids and explore acting and stuff so that was cool. rediscovered feelings for the most awesome girl and that was probably the best part about musical.  Ummm this weekend was unbelievable, friday night was the best night ive had in a long time.  i asked sarah to prom and i think she was surprised, i hope she liked it, i thought it was an okay idea.  then we spent the rest of the night on the beach and watching big fish.  she rocks my world and is unbelievable.  Saturday made 50 bucks playing a jazz show and then saw troy which had good scenes and stuff but it wasnt anything special.  and today has been very chill.  my sis came home from college crying because she jsut graduated and is very sad.  i feel really bad for her....it must be hard to move on from such a great experience.  Summer is just around the corner and i cant wait.  Things are going awesome with the band, we have new songs and new ideas and were chill about sutff for once and its great.  Things are always lookinh up and everything is great.  keep it real lol

sincerly

"event","its 12:00 and ive got 2 tests tommorow....fuck it im writing...

i always seem to get attatched to the wrong girl.....i cant help its, its like im falling back on something cuz its a comfort zone, but what if its what i really want.  well not like it matters, im nothing more than a 2 minute crush for her, which kinda sucks cuz even tho im leaving for college in about 5 months, i would like someone to spend it with.  but maybe i dont even want that cuz i wanna spend the time with my friends.  its like im scared...but im not.  I wonder whats gonna happen to our friendships, i wonder whats gonna happen with my band, i wonder if i'll totally forget everything that happened here.  Somethings i wouldnt mind to forget, like when i made some mistakes and messed up what i had wanted for so long.  but that was a long time ago and its all good now....it definatley turned out for the best, cuz she is with who fits her well.....and i well i'm still looking i suppose. it's nothing to get depressed about because if this is all i have to worry about then my life isnt so bad.  i've been reflecting on hs alot latley and i dont regret anything about it. i've met the greatest kids in the world and ive had great experiences.  i wish i could leave on a good note with everyone but i know thats not possible cuz some people just cant let go but hey whatever floats ur boat i guess.  i cant believe how fast hs went by....its like im still a freshman playing soccer well not really playing more like sitting the bench, but like getting nervous about the first dance and everything is so new.  now im a senior and im supposed to knwo everything, but in fact i know nothing.  i think its really weird how you an be so close to someone...then if you give it time its like they were never in your life.  i remember for a year and half i talked on the phone everynight to amanda and now its like ive never met her.  its kinda sad to think about but maybe thats just how things are supposed to work.  i mean for 9 months of my life i thought i knew what love was....and maybe i do but now its like fran wasnt even in my life.  its just kinda interesting how it happens.  what if all this is just a phase that in 2 years you wont remember?? i want to remember cuz these are some good times. you dont need to find a soul mate to be happy. thats for later on in life i suppose.  maybe its all this summer air that getting me into a better mood i dunno. i cant wait for the summer.  im gonna live out every night and every day. i want to spend my last summer in AHT as awesome as possible cuz it is my last summer here....my parents are selling the house next year when i go away cuz it will be a big empty house now that all the kids are gone.  it must be hard for them to let their youngest go and grow up.  parenting is probably hard as hell, much props to parents for doing everything they do.  but yea i dunno i cant wait to start new, but it will be hard to say goodbye.  This place is all ive known, growing up is a weird feeling. i hope someday i can come back here and be cool with everyone i knew.  i hope people remember me. its soo easy to forget.  (another random thought) i wonder if people know that you think about a moment from the past but they dont even think of you anymore.  memories are good things to hang on too.  even if they are painful they help make up who you are. i learned that from eternal sunshine of the spotless mind... its good you should go see it. you know whats the best? being able to kiss someone goodnight....and just being able to kiss someone that you know likes possibly loves you back.  theres almost nothing better.  i do miss that but im not gonna wallow in pity cuz thats jsut kinda dumb.  whatever happens happens, enjoy life no matter what. and im going to go now cuz i dotn want to babble lol hahaha alright til next time you crazy kids

"event","hello all....
This is my first post in awhile...alot has happened i guess. First of all recording is going good...jsut got the all the bass stuff done today.  Just got back from a trip to iowa.  It was kinda lonley cuz everyone on teh bus had someone to hold onto and stuff like that, when i had to fall asleep by myself.  I just want to find someone.  It seems like everybody is finding somebody and its not like i feel pressure or anything its just making me miss the whole relationship thing.  But eh what else is new right? but now i think there is hope in the dept.  In other news swimming is finally over which rocks.  The final stretch of school is on...and im ready to be done.. you know same old same old.....Im thankful for having great friends...you guys rock....awesome to be making new friends.....and things are always looking up.....

"event","Well.....lots of news for you all.  first and formost...and saddest..... the end of 504 plan.  These guys have meant so much to me for the past 2 years and their music has inspired me so much.  Them breaking up is such a lowpoint of this already shitty winter.  You will be missed so much...and its time for new bands to bring back what teh chicago music scene used to be all about.  Secondly latley I've been in such a blah mood i cant describe it.  Things in the past seem to be coming back on me more and more.  Things ive finally laid to rest jsut wont die.  I guess i could contribute feelings of lonliness to the winter and cold.  ah i cant wait til the warm air comes to release me.  I will be able to forget that this girl ever existed and forget an ex friend of mine who pretends everything is ok when its not ( why does he do that....lol it jsut annoys the shit outta me now..its like dude ok you stole teh girl i liked wow that gay stop acting like nothing happened) lol but thats besdies teh point.  I wanna feel the summer wind, i wanna be out at my lakehouse....i wanna be able to smile because im looking into the eyes of a girl who means alot to me while were laying down on my couch watching a movie and falling alseep together......holy shit that was ridiculously emo...sorry guys lol.  At least ive got my awesome friends to get me through this....bryan, teddy, pat, trevor you guys rock.  Im glad im becoming good friends with adam too hes a cool kid into cool music...you rock man.  and slowly but surely im making good friends with some meadows people. but yea......things are always loooking up

In other news....i couldnt be happier with the band. the music is our best ever and i think this new ep is gonna hopefully get us some attention.  I feel like almost it my purpose in life to do this.  Like i cant imangine myself doing something else.  at least i hope thats teh case. but i was also thinking...ive been writing the best lyrics of my life latley cuz ive been broken hearted and lonley....which sucks cuz if im ever happy with girls...my music writing will suck lol oh well ill learn to deal.  whatever but yea teh band is rocking so much. so happy with that....

other than that i guess thats alll....until later when poeple start yelling at me to update again i will lol alright im out"

"event","Alright well.......its been awhile but lets see if i can sum up how im feeling in as few words as possible.  I dont know why i do the things i do or i dont know why i feel the way i feel.  to everyone im sorry for being in a such a down mood all the time, its jsut how i feel.  Also im sorry that couldnt feel the way you wanted me to feel.  Im in a really weird slump and i dont know how to get out of it.....and honestly its not me missing being with fran because ive gotten over that.  Its jsut kinda like an empty hole in my life where there was purpose, now there is none.  Everything ive known before is gone out the window.  example one day i go into wendys really down and i jsut want the one thing that can make me feel better a nice 99 cent double stack with cheese...but god dammit they raised the price to 1.30.  It was just a pinch of reality that the world will spin whether i want it to or not.  Ive been writing alot of stuff which translates to good music, i hope we can record that stuff soon and get our stuff out to labels which would be cool.  bllllllahhh is totally how i feel, its probably with the winter and coldness but whatever.  Things are always looking up.  Until next time.  i love you all, and im sure we'll make it through this shitty ass season and we'll see the glory and warthm of spring and new love and new everything...alright that was gay sorry im out

"event","i should start out by apologizing........
1. im sorry i got so pissed about nothing and stuff i knew nothing about, it just had a lot of angry all built up and i needed to vent...my bad
2.  sorry to anyone who i ever ignored or ripped on, i didnt mean it
3.  im sorry i got drunk and did i wasnt supposed to do over the summer, and all the shit i put you through, im paying for my mistake everyday and this emptiness in my heart hurts more than any shot to the nuts or any physical pain...you know who you are..i love you more than you'll ever know and im sorry
4.  sorry to october fall who are a bunch of fuckheads, im sorry you cant look past your superficial image and superficial fans.

"event","hello, sorry its been awhile, ive been kinda wrapped up.  But today was the first day of swimming, and holy crap im outta shape.  Nothing much going on, in the middle of putting the finishing touches on an acoustic which me and bry are recording on saturday.  Other than that nothing really is happening.  The girl situation i wouldnt not prefer to talk about at this particualr moment but at some point i will will tell the story.  Oh another thing, im really sick of hearing about these cocky local bands that are putting other bands down.  Everyones trying hard to do their own thing, but you do deserve to get made fun of if you plagarize.  But seriosuly jsut let everyone do their thing.  Things would be beter off if everybody just helped each other out.  thats all i have to say see you later"

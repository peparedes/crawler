"event","Well, no more phucked up dreams, well last night I didnt sleep so that doesnt count, but the night before does. My pager is broken so I am going to take it back today, along with getting some new pants... hopefully. Micheal(my ex) is threatening to kill himself cuz I don't want to be his friend. So I got a spell to get rid of him, no not like death, lol, like for him to forget about me. My hair is purple now. Last night I sent energies to Bill, and it was kewl, later wheni talk to him he was doing better. Maybe it worked:)
I hope so.

"event","Hmm. I met some nice ladys on the Witchhaven mailing list. They have dicided I am a changeling. This almost makes sence. Last night while I was sleeping (after they told me) I had a weird dream. Things were flying through my head, memories, animals, objects, places, and I heard a voice saying stuff, but I couldnt make out what it was saying. It was very strange. Im going to have to go to the library to find out more about Changelings"

"event","Well, I didnt make it to the library, grrr, it was closed till Sept 5. Im going to go to one of the other librarys. I got alot of other info off the web, at someone off of the witchaven mailing lists sites. it was great info, my only problem was it wasnt fully working so i am guna go back and see if I can access the rest of the pages. I have started typeing up alot of info instead of writting it down, it will make it easyer on me, so if I run out of space in my Book of Shadows I wont have to start a new book, I can just keep printing out what I have typed up and put it all in a binder. I also e-mailed some people in my area who are wiccan and pagan and hopefuly they will write back and we can talk about stuff. Maybe they know of some stored that sell good stuff. I only know of Womans Wish."

I've been selling our books and random crap on Amazon because etsy bites.&nbsp; Amazon also doesn't make you pay up front for listing things, but there are some restrictions and the fees you do pay kinda bites at the end.

I have an appointment tomorrow to talk to a doc about sleep apnea.&nbsp; Have a followup on the abnormal pap smear/biopsy sometime in the next month.&nbsp; Still waiting for another doc to call me back for the appointment for adhd.&nbsp; blah.

"event","Everyone who flies knows that airport food is terrible and sometimes even stale, but hunger is amazingly good at making you do crazy things.&nbsp; I had enough foresight to bring a snack of my favorite Anna's ginger thin cookies and some cheese so that I wouldn't have to buy the overpriced, salt encrusted junk they sell on planes nowadays in lieu of food, but didn't have time to pack a bento for us like I'd originally planned to do.&nbsp; And so, mad with hunger, I grabbed a burger at the Burger King at MKE.&nbsp; I wasn't expecting it to be good, but I did expect them not to short me the one meat patty that was supposed to be in there.&nbsp; I'd heard that the meat in burgers had withered into rather thin corn-filled wafers over the years, but not that it had shrunken to the point of nonexistence.&nbsp; Over $3 for a bun with a smattering of toppings?&nbsp; Ridiculous doesn't even begin to describe it.

Still, this is nothing compared to the bullshit the TSA puts us through.&nbsp; I've had them demand that I let them X-ray an empty water bottle after I downed the contents right in front of them.&nbsp; It's not like you could hide much in the small bit of opaque plastic cap. I'm not sure when they decided that shoes could not be placed in the plastic bins (but is ok for other stuff?), or if the ones at MKE are particularly stupid, but they moved mine without telling me and left the laces dangling.&nbsp; It got caught on the rollers and as I tried to free them, more stuff came up and smashed into the boots.&nbsp; I've had the boots for years so I'm not afraid of a few scuff marks, but I do want to prevent them from being unnecessarily trashed.&nbsp; The bin with my laptop rolled out over the laces and as I tried to move it all, more stuff smashed out, this time flipping the bin with my laptop.&nbsp; The woman working for the TSA LAUGHED at me and said ""You just flipped your computer out!""&nbsp; I wanted to say ""Bitch, fuck you.&nbsp; I'm not blind and I really don't appreciate you laughing at my misfortunes."" but I didn't want them to haul me into some room and beat me.&nbsp;"

When I read Howl's Moving Castle as a kid, I loved the idea of being able to turn a dial on a door and open it to a different city whenever I wanted to.  Now, to get to California, I have to let the TSA rifle through my things.  I'm certainly not driving over 2000 miles and Amtrak's website pissed me off.

"event","I has precancer.&nbsp;  Wish me luck or pray for me or rattle some chicken bones or whatever you folks do.  <br /><br />In my search for info, I came across this:<br /><div style=""margin-left: 40px;"">Vitamin Supplements May Increase Breast Cancer<br /><br />Multivitamin-multimineral supplement use and mammographic breast density by Sylvie B&eacute;rub&eacute; in the May 2008 issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that, &ldquo;Regular multivitamin-multimineral supplement use was found to be associated with higher mean breast density among premenopausal women&hellip;Because breast density is strongly and positively related to breast cancer risk, these findings do not support any benefit from multivitamin-multimineral supplement use on breast cancer risk. Instead, they suggest that such multivitamin-multimineral supplement use should be studied for its possible association with an increased risk of breast cancer.&rdquo;1<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />Taking various vitamin supplements, like beta-carotene, vitamin E, and/or folic acid has been found in multiple studies to increase the risk of cancer, heart disease, and overall death.2 Many observational studies have found that a high intake of fruits and vegetables, which are also filled with antioxidant, folic acid, and other vitamins, is associated with a decreased risk of cancer.  Foods are not the same as supplements. When isolated, concentrated nutrients are ingested, as with multivitamin and multimineral supplements, chemical imbalances are created within the cells&mdash;the end result, as many studies have shown, is an increased risk of disease and earlier death.2<br /><br />More than half of the women in the US take supplements; therefore, even a small percentage increase in illness will mean many people are affected.  People should be getting their nutrients in their original packages&mdash;starches, vegetables, and fruits. Supplements should be considered medicines, at best, and should carry appropriate warnings on their labels, at least.<br /><br />1) B&eacute;rub&eacute; S, Diorio C, Brisson J.

"event","Mushroom pate made with pork, though not exactly low sodium or veg friendly, is OMFG delicious on my OMFG homemade cheesy bread, which is also not very low on sodium after all.&nbsp; Damn you, asiago!

Things I've learned:

Asiago is higher in sodium, which probably contributed to the less-than-expected levels of rising.&nbsp; Not sure what else it would have been.&nbsp; 

Shredded cheese disappears into the bread and adds some cheesy taste, but I'll probably have to chunk the cheese if I want to see any actual cheesy bits in the bread.&nbsp; This may or may not help the rising.&nbsp; After I'm done with this bit of asiago, I doubt I'll be getting more any time soon.&nbsp; Goodbye, salty goodness!

Cutting back on sodium is hard when you didn't have all that much to begin with and some things are just SO tasty.&nbsp; 

I have Chinese sausage and salami.&nbsp; I might throw them into the bread next time and skip the salt and butter that I'm out of anyway.&nbsp; I wonder how well spinach would go with them...

It takes me at least a week to eat a loaf of bread if I'm eating some every day.&nbsp; There are settings in my bread maker for a smaller loaf so I may go with that.&nbsp; Might bake more evenly, too.&nbsp; I aim to use up all of the jar of yeast before we move next year so I don't have to toss it out.&nbsp; Might sell the breadmaker before we move, too, but not before the end of winter because I'm putting it and any toaster I get in the bedroom!"

We cut              and wrap it in special papers to preserve the flavor and allow the              cheese to breath this is very important for storing most cheeses.</lj-cut>This European delight is made from raw cow's milk from the Savoie              region in France, adding depth to the flavor and giving it a sweet              taste and the smell of fresh hay. Aptly named (the word Morbier means              &quot;small market town&quot;), Morbier was originally made by cheesemakers              who lived in the village of Morez in the Jura Mountains of France.              Situated in a deep valley, a few miles from the Swiss border, Morez              is now surrounded by ski resorts - Les Rouss<br /> Morbier Du Livradois comes to us in a fourteen pound wheel. We cut and wrap it in special papers to preserve the flavor and allow the cheese to breath this is very important for storing most cheeses.es, Pr&eacute;manon, Morbier,              Bellefontaine, etc.</p>           About two hundred years ago when Morbier was first made, the cheese-makers              used left over curd from Comte production - Morbier was made strictly              for the cheesemakers consumption. The look of this AOC cheese is quite              distinctive with a horizontal gray-black line running through the              middle of it. This &quot;line&quot; is actually a mixture of edible              vegetable ash. The cheesemaker would press the leftover curd from              the evening's production of Comte into a round mold and cover that              curd with a thin layer of ash to prevent it from drying out. The next              day he pressed the leftover morning curd on top of the ash. (Yes,              cows need to be milked twice a day!) You could tell which layer of              the cheese came from the evening milking, since it tastes fruitier              than that from the morning milking.<br />           There are lots of stories about how that ash became part of this              cheese. One that sounds plausible is that the curd was left to sit              by the fire overnight until the morning milking, and the ash from              the fire blew on to the settling Curd. Others say soot from the bottom              of the kettles was intentionally rubbed on the evening layer to keep              it from drying. Our favorite story is that a clumsy cheesemaker dropped              a freshly made cheese&hellip; and to hide the soiled side, he placed              another layer on top. Traditionally, a half wheel of Morbier would              be propped up by the fire. As it started to melt, the cheese would              be scraped on to crusty bread or hot potatoes. As the tradition suggests,              Morbier is a wonderful cheese for melting! Bon appetit!<lj-cut><br />           <p><img vspace=""10"" hspace=""10"" align=""texttop"" src=""http://www.cheesemonthclub.com/pastnewsletters/images/0304auvergne.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />             The Auvergne where both Morbier and Cantal originated, lies in the              heart of the Massif Central, a mountain range with a chain of long              extinct volcanoes, or &quot;Puy.&quot; The Allier is rich farm country              with gentle hills and huge forests. The landscape of the Puy-de-Dome              and Cantal highlands changes into sweeping glacier valleys, lakes,              waterfalls and wide plateaux. There you will find unspoiled Medieval              towns and mountain villages. And in the wilds of the Livradois, remote              stone and slate roofed &quot;jasseries, burons, or actives&quot; -              ancient summer farmhouses on the plateaux. As you might expect, the              people here are warm and friendly.</p>                      Much of the flora and fauna common in the wilder parts of France              are not found in other parts of Europe. You will see many varieties              of wild orchids (e.g. the elderflower, pyramidal, and marsh), the              spring anemone, wild pansies and narcissi, maiden pinks, and the great              yellow gentian. Clover, all sorts of wild-flowers, and wild onions              are some of plants the cows feast on, and what a cow eats really does              flavor the milk they produce, and the resulting cheeses. It's kind              of like adding fresh fruit to make a milk shake, but this way it's              added before the cow is milked. A charming place to visit - from spring              until late autumn, there are country fetes held to celebrate the harvest              and the movement of the herds to and from their mountain pastures.              And you will find numerous markets where you can trawl through piles              of bric-a-brac.<br />           <p><br />             <strong><font size=""4"">Tasting Notes</font></strong></p>           This AOC cheese is uncooked, pressed, and allowed to mature for two              months, then it is brushed with brime and allowed to age at least              another two months. During the maturing period, Morbier develops a              natural fine creamy-brown crust or rind. At maturity it is semi-soft,              yet firm, and has a complex fruity flavor with a slight zing sophisticated,              yet liked by many. The ivory-yellow p&acirc;te is often described              as supple, springy, and silky when touched - dry and sticky at the              same time. Not only serving as a divide, the vegetable ash separating              the cheese layers makes an aesthetic, dramatic presentation and has              a complex, bold flavor. Mobier is a cheese that can steal the show              when it comes to cheese platters. Companion wines include light fruity              reds, Arbois red or white, Pouilly sur Loire, and tangy white wines              like Muscadet and Sancerre.<br />           <strong>FYI </strong>- AOC: About 40 cheeses in France, including              Mobier and Cantal, have been awarded The Appellation d'Origine Controlee.              This designation guarantees that the cheeses have been produced within              a specified province, region, and commune, follows traditional recipes              and production methods, monitors affinage (maturity), and maintains              the highest prescribed standards.</lj-cut>"

"event","So there's a name for this... I feel totally weak after being tickled or laughing too much sometimes.  I try to show Chad by squeezing his arm as hard as I can and he just looks at me funny.  On the very rare occasion, I have trouble holding things because I can't get my fingers to close around something tight enough.  Suck!  But it doesn't last too long and isn't so bad that I can't just deal with it and do squeeze tests while waiting for my strength to return.  (I will crush you, little styrofoam cup!!  Just you wait!!  Huuuuurgh!  Just you wait some more!)  

I assume this has something to do with how sensitive my skin is, which makes it easier to flood and overload whatever part of the noggin' handles that sort of thing and fails to ignore most of it like most people's do.  I occasionally go ""OMG! Texture! Mmm......""  

I guess I'm weirder than I thought."

"event","Normal kids have hobbies like stamp collecting or sports.  I spent my time as a kid at the library reading about birds and everything I could find about them, including their reproduction and diseases.  Because of this, I know far more about eggs than any person who doesn't work with birds should ever need to know.  

The hubbie loves eating eggs and feels bad for the chickens so he buys only cage free egg$, which are supposed to be more humane than regular, cheaper eggs.  I aim to inform you that this is not necessarily the case, that the chickens are not necessarily better off and these eggs are inferior to regular eggs even though they can cost several times more.

We have a few dozen eggs in the fridge, all ""cage free"".  The size and shape of the eggs are irregular, and many of the eggs themselves have a ""wobbly"" appearance.  A quick search found half a dozen cracked and some badly broken, whites oozing out.  The worst ones were scaly, with numerous visible pits and bumps or ""pimples"".  One had a mysterious yellowish area on the shell, not caused by direct contact with the broken egg sitting diagonally from it, as the spot was on top.

A site for reference:
http://www.thepoultrysite.com/ourbooks/1/egg-quality-handbook/

These problems can be caused by stress, poor nutrition, crowding, age, and/or disease.  

I took these photos at about 5:30 AM, so the only lighting was what came with the kitchen.  Behold the nastiness:

""My interest in money, and my pride in making it, were very new. I had gone through Harvard planning to become a philosophy professor. But to my surprise and dismay, I was bored silly. I also felt trapped financially as never before. Grad school meant not just classes, but ugly wallpaper, furniture from the street that I could not afford to replace, and a cheap apartment. It was years before I could eat squid ($3 for a 5lb frozen block) or liver (60 cents a pound) again.

By the end of the spring semester, I had lost interest in teaching philosophy: I knew I would go mad if I had to spend the next five years like this. The only ambition that made sense to me was to become rich. I passionately wanted to be able to say that I was successful, even if it was just to myself that I said it. Money was a good thing, I knew with the unshakable conviction of one for whom it had been short. But the status that money provided was an even better thing."""

Unrelated: I had another dream last night in which I was flipping through a book with a ton of awesome information and answers to all the questions I'd ever want answered.&nbsp; I kept going OOO, I want to read that section!&nbsp; And this section!&nbsp; And this one!&nbsp; One explained&nbsp; the physical brain and thoughts, which as far as I know, is not something we completely understand yet.&nbsp; It also went into brains figuring out puzzles and security problems.&nbsp; It's like the encyclopedia for kids I had when I was a kid and thought was totally awesome, only much more ginormous and so much more... orgasmically delicious.&nbsp; I'm always sad when I wake up from dreams in which I find a book with awesometastic knowledge and can't bring it out of the dream.&nbsp; It looked like your typical modern bio textbook on the inside, at least, from what I remember of the parts I looked at, but the outside was... different, like it kept fading in and out of existence.&nbsp; The dimensions of the book also kept changing.&nbsp; I was in a fairly well lit, sizeable&nbsp; room, possibly in a library.

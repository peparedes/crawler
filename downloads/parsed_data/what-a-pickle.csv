"event","i don't have the internet so this is just a quick word of hello on georginas computer. and as i feel pushed by oppertunity to make this entry, i doubt it will be that fantastic.

i have cried three times today.

1. because i went for a meeting about dropping out, and this guy who invited himself into the conversation was a fucking tosser and therefore made me cry.

2. because Alice and I went to see ""miss potter"" together and it made me cry. Alice told me to keep in touch which was nice i suppose.

3. because the Vicar of Dibley documentary took me by suprise and the end when Alice Tinker&nbsp;cried after the filming just made me Well the fuck up.

There are too many Alice's in this entry. When i text her that i was dropping out she also said ""me too"" which was quite an hilarious happening. So we met up and bitched about dropping out and uni in general. it was nice. i said to her that she was one of the very few people i had met that i felt were on the same wavelength as me, and she said that i was the only one she had&nbsp;met. so we were lucky to find eachother i suppose. i BET she is a Pieces. i am placing loads of trust in the stars these days, which is probably a MASSIVE mistake. Georgina and Conor have gone a tad insane and aren't hearing any words coming out of my mouth as they are playing computer games. boys with their toys.

dilema ... do i go out with Mel Cornford to her birthday party in Leicester, which is a pub/club crawl, in which you must dress as a Pirate? oh QUESTIONS QUESTIONS. bye then x"

georgina and i started off from my house at 5pm, stupid time to start a tri-county trip to Nottingham if you ask me, rush hour scares and directions gone terribly wrong equaled out at us being in the car for just over two hours. We had only made it ten minutes down the road before we got lost for the first time, those directions kept on saying ""bare left (or right)"", now in thinking this means ""turn"" left or right, you would find your thinking was incorrect. It was foul and got us lost more than anything.

After getting lost on many one way streets in Nottingham we finally arrived, when it was dark, at The Rescue Rooms, it was nice and small with a nice bar although it was pretty dark in there, still reasonably pleasant. We got cold Cokes and Waters with ice and then wandered around looking for the actual room where Nizlopi would be playing. We went outside and then looked about the place like gimps, as we were walking back towards the bar i walked into the wrong door and then realised i had found it. We got stamps on our hands that began to rub off as soon as they were put on.

When we first got in there was a woman on stage who looked abit like a man, who was okay, the woman sitting next to her was playing the Chelo. The Chelo woman was wearing a wedding dress and looked pretty irritating, the singing lady had a very strong voice but was wearing wellington boots and was also called Chantelle. Need i say anymore. Georgina and i found our way to the front and in thinking  Nizlopi were actually gonna come on now, we were wrong, it was a REALLY COOL guy called Declan O'Rourke. He was really cool, and he said cool, in a really great way, and he was amazing on guitar, he was bashing away at those strings like nothing i have ever seen, i think he might have broken a plectrum in half!

Eventually Nizlopi came on after some harrowing loud Hip Hop music which indulged in the word fuck, far too much for my liking. Although, i actually just thought that it was funny, the girls behind us moaned about it greatly like mardy middleaged women. Nizlopi started to playing and they weren't on stage, they had moved themselves into the middle of the crowd and began playing there. It was like you had to like them even if you never really would because they just had a certain char, about them. They played well, and impressivly. Luke was funny and John was so amazingly talented and a bit of a weirdo, in a good shy way. The part i remember most about the evening was when someone in the crowd shouted out ""beatbox motherfucker"" in the quite part of the JCB song. It was funny, the whole gig had such a lovely nice atmosphere, it was just really great! John said nothing the entire gig, people kept shouting telling him to speak, Luke asked him to but he gave a moments thought, said ""no"" and shook his head. he was cool. they were cool, it was a lovely nice night. When it finished we had trouble getting a toilet with toilet paper, and there were some really proper fat lesbains with short spiky hair and i didn't know what to do with myself! i ran away and had some water and we soon left. Driving home, we again got lost pretty quickly and it was pretty much peachy. we just headed towards leicester, going round some roundabouts a few times before choosing where to go, with no REAL guidance. it was nice. two hours ten minutes back to sheepy, wasn't bad. x"

"event","yesterday, i got up early and went to miss green's house. we got the bus to town and met neena, visited many places, including the warmest tax office in the whole WORLD. air conditioning really went a miss there. we went for a far too filling lunch at Chimichanga's the flat bread mexican pizza was yummy yummy yummy. i bought a DVD of a film i have never heard much about, i didn't and still don't know what it is about ... humm, exciting! we shopped some more and i got some gross passport photos done for my uni SHIT, what a joke, i look so disguisting/spotty/pale/drugged up! my eyes look so spaced. we went back to neenas lovely house. sat in her room and looked at MANY BEAutiful photos. i did ofcourse get more digital prints in town because i am sick. so we sat and made lydia a beautiful goodbye card as she is leaving for Lincoln to live with Tom in a FLAT, we are all growing up fast. Neena and sophie and myself went for chips and bought some alcohol for Lydias leaving party. Burgers WITH onions is such a bad thing, as is McDonalds. we went to Lydias house with Nat, Neens, Sophie, Lydia and Tom. We played numerous games of snap, i nearly killed Neena through laughter, i do tend to get abit violent in the old game of snap. i nearly broke my little finger. Neena taught me how to play Poker, dispite the many times i have been taught before, i played and won loads of times not really knowing what i was doing. we played with bottles of alcopop instead of chips but it worked fine. we then played a million drinking games for like three hours and had an absolute blast. i will really miss Lydia and Tom, but housewarming party on the way means more drinking games fun. everyone got rather drunk and jolly, and i as usual just got a REALLY hot face. i don't know why this happens. we continued the evening along with much dancing to 90's pop including some very old songs that in the drunkness i inturn forgot all of the words. EXCEPT that is for the Spice Girls. sophies dad picked us up at 10.30 and i could have stayed for hours. her dad has a cool sat nav thing in his car, i loved it telling him where to go. when i got home i sat for a good while on msn, talking to sophie in quite a hazzy stuper which in turn equally made my msn name end up as ""i_love_alicia_green"".
oh good times babes.

Drinking games.

its quite insane now, i just can't wait to get out at the moment. i need to get my computer here up and running and then i do just need to climb inside it and get sent to portsmouth. i am going so far and i just can't wait, i CAN NOT wait, i have to get out of this house and my family need to stop talking to me, i just need to beable to sit for ten minutes and not have them call me from somewhere else in the house. it is slowly driving me insane. earlier on i was actually banging my head AGAINST the wall, hard ... no joke.

Quote of the day, ""do the boys have to cook their own meals at university as well?!?!?!?"" ... ... another generation has certainly passed. She always wary of the word ""creative"" in creative writing and i don't think she understand the use in learning about film, but then again neither do i.

previous to today was results day in which i got A in film, B in english and C in theatre. so i am off to Portsmouth, besides all of the worries, i can't fucking wait!!! i feel as if my mind is dissolving into its self here. i need to just run away. i can't even write because i have no inspiration, i go to write and i just feel like punching myself in the head. its really starting to grate on me.

i cried at the big brother final, because yes, i am a girl.

i have done ALOT today but it feels like non of it ever happened or that i am actually just asleep all the time. i think i am gonna go get some kip. i need it i think. i feel ugly and fat and tired, i need to get some beauty sleep. of course."

"event","today has been a crazy day, i have been waiting for a time to write an LJ because i haven't for ages, but i have finally thought of something good that you might actually like reading.

ben and i went to town at the crack of dawn today and saw beth rollingstone on the bus she is a cool girl! she has such an infectious laugh. we walked around town looking for clothes, on the streets etc. we are poor at clothes shopping, instead i bought 53 digital prints. the best from my entire collection of digital photographs, when i hold them in my hands i feel like i am holding actual beauty in which every single photograph can be appriciated better by its self. alone. ermmmmmm, so we went off in hope of clothes and walking along we hear a beautiful woman singing. it was amazing, it was possibly half way through a sentence but we just stopped and scanned around for the person singing so amazingly. there was this girl who looked around 22 or something, she had cool little beads and a tonge piercing and brown tied back hair and golden sparkle sandles and she was standing with her tiny amp and worn guitar, she was beautiful and wondetful.

we stood in awe and looked at her and i think she knew that we had stopped just to stare and listen in admoration. her voice was so impressive and she was cool with a cool little mouth and crazy eyes. we stood furthur more and then free fall felix came along and we chatted to them about the STD clinic being shut and how pissed off they all were, we didn't press the matter. jon was pissed off and we pretty much ignored them because we were extremely distracted. we decided to take a seat on the bench after fff left. we sat and watched some more and got out many a pound from out tight purse strings ready to jump up and give her all of our money. she looked at us a few more times. and then she spoke to us. we ran right up to her and the Just 99p shop and she asked us what kind of music we liked. we requested some songs and she chatted to us inbetween, she did two songs in a row not saying anything. she seemed pretty shy really because we couldn't stop saying after every song how wonderful she was. she then asked us for our number. she took mine because ben doesn't charge his phone. she said ""you seem dead sound"" and she really liked us. i found that quite strange, she is gonna call us to tell us when she is next in leicester, she wants to hang out and jam. i think that she will have a great time and i shall suduce her, ha ... in my dreams. so, we chatted for a bit longer and i said that she should move to the other side of the street because she will get burnt standing in the sun all day, when we passed later she had moved. she is called marieann, if she doesn't call i will be deeply dissapointed.

so we shopped for clothes and bought none. i did instead buy 5 LP's ... i have OCD.

we got on our bus back home and henri rang to tell me i had to go to a hellish time in the park for another sarah mukaddam leaving do, i have been to the three so far, just the one left. humpphhhh. it was alright i ate too many ginger snap biscuits, and listened to some more live acoustic music. people are alright really. Mel and Sarah were great, i hadn't seen mel for a while so it was good when she jumped on me, and of course being nusseled into her breast isn't something i will ever shy away from.

i then regretted eating chinease chicken balls with sweet and sour sauce, then i got a migrane BUT georgina did buy me some water so she is a dame. 

bus, home, big brother, rat, sugar rush, cry, headache, talk about have obssesive complsive disorder over a cup of tea, lj and soon to be summer of love and talk of films. today has been confusing but i will live to analyse it another day. ""marrieann's a bitch"" PAH, i love her. xxx"

pretty much i have had some fun days. friday - beth and i went to loughborough as my sister was going to sell beth some books which i wish someone would do for me. Beth got a great deal and i won't have any money to spend on books because i will only have 19.50 to spend on food and living clothes etc. per week at uni ... oh well. so we drank tea with my sister in the garden but the sun hurt my eyes, beth, my sister and i sat in the lounge talking about theatre and irish fiction, we then walked into town and went shopping abit. Beth danced rather embarressingly in virgin megastores to some terrible songs and then we went for lunch. we drank tea and talked about all the people we know and how everything has changed and how everything is going to continue to change. we realised so completely how insane all of the people we know really are and decided that they just make our lives more interesting.
We walked to the library on the way being stopped by a monk trying to sell us a book. later on in the day we caved and spend three pounds on a book of old tales. it jabbers on a bit but its got some nice pictures. we went and got a ice cream and walked round the park, we looked at some pretty birds in cages and then got some milkshakes. we sat on the grass looking around at all these crazy kids in dresses, talking about how great it is to be a child. we took some photos and counted my money in the sunshine. we walked round a nature museum and learnt about pulleys. we are so not 18. we went back to town and bought a NOW 36 tape with some fit 90's pop to listen to on the way back. on returning to the car it turned out the tapes had got mixed up and we didn't get to listen to stop by the spice girls. it was a terrible shame. life is good anyway.

mel, adele and i slept at adeles for the night and had a lovely time. we did some jamming on the guitar and piano, adele, we need to learn some new material. we watched Sezer get evicted which i felt was a shame as he was a good housemate and not a bad guy (i know others will disagree) but he is more interesting than the mother and father that are lea and ""dickie""  cringe. we made tea and adele didn't make me any hoops on toast, i defrosted a loaf and had some bread and butter, yummy yummy, mel had some foul foul mushroomy pasta shiz which looked like sick and adele pigged out on when left over and cold. we sat in adeles old computer room/mildreds old bedroom and looked at old photos when we were about 9/10 years old, this weirdo chritian easter do, where we hung out with every kid from every villiage, we looked at some people that we didn't know and then found georgina gilberts 9 year old face among the crowd. she looks cool as. we sat in a line on the sofa texted people in complete silence ... we are anti-social geeks we eventually went to sleep but adele played shakira on her phone so much that it was imposible not to dance. i fucking love that song, shakira ft.wycliff jean - hips don't lie single out 12th june.BUY BUY BUY.

Today we went shopping and bought nothing everything felt deflated and i was far too quite. i had a headache the entire time, for shame. we went back to my house and mel and i kicked back with a few diet cokes and some bbq burgers and watched tomorrow never dies, daniel craig won't be a great 007. adele came over and we went to sophies house, we sat in the garden and had a glass of ribena and sophie so lovingly shared out her CARAMEL mini roles. i feel very special. we went to bens and watched big brother in his bedroom (i love how one show can take over your life). we decided to go on a walk in the dark and we ventured off into the country roads around barlestone till 10.40. we sat on a bench and sophie said i had wondering hands around her stomach area. she helds them in her lap whilst sitting uninvited on me. she kept hitting me with her hair. we drove home listening to some more 90's pop. and had a proper rave to run dmc. it was quality fun, i drove carelessly and they all loved it. overall i had a good time. 

i still have a headache. (sorry this is so long)x"

"event","it was saterday and rachels party it was really great fun hanging out with everyone playing party games from our 90's and realising the children within ourselves. sophie clearly being the bully of her primary school class, she got incredibly violent when playing pass the parcel. whe she eventually had the music stop on her she screamed holding the parcel, i was so scared/shocked that all i could do was cry in confusion/fear. the look on adele's face when sophie screamed was what made me laugh the most. i love them all. henrietta and i both had a hand each on the parcel when the music stopped and instead of screaming and fighting as sophie surely would have we opened it together and won some radish seeds. if henri doesn't plant them i will then set sophie on her.

Then Amy hockaday came over on the sunday and it was back to rachels to hang out and do what we know best. Be 14 again. it was alot more fun than expected, it was just like the old days. watching Strictly Ballroom knowing all of the words and screaming with laughter. Amy is the most genuin person that exsists. there is no bullshit there it was such a nice break from the bitching and analysing that i am used to. even though the two things although however opposite they may be i both enjoy. Hannah Thrussell came over and it was just perfect again, i was so truely happy, it's been a while. we sat on the sofa and took around 30 pictures of ourselves.

"event","we sat in his bed last night and talked all about the last time i go over before i go to uni the next day. i would drive over and we would sit in his lounge make some tea, watch B4, read some scripts back, go on a walk, the last walk together, then we would go back and make some more tea and watch a film. i would cry at whatever it was and then i would be crying uncontrollably for ages, and then i would have to go, because i have to get up early to drive down to portsmouth. he would walk me to my car and then i would get in and go. then everyone will have depression at uni because it starts in the most likely time for people to suffer from depression. I CAN'T WAIT!

i spent most of last night lying in Ben's bed crying. we talked about the fact that school ends in two weeks. most people don't like school at all anymore and can't wait to get out but to be honest, even though i can 100% see their views, i disagree with them. i am just so frightened of going out there in the big wide world, BY MYSELF. we are starting completely new lives with no one else there that we already know. we could present ourseleves as completely different people as no one we will meet in september/october will have ever met us. i won't change though, some people might, they might want to start a fresh and leave the rest of us behind. i believe from the bottom of my heart that i won't ever meet anyone who is as good as someone i already know. and then there is all this ""we must keep in touch"" bullshit. i really need to, i am SO FUCKING determined to. the thought of not speaking to [insert big list of all of my friends] ever again makes me sick. i love them all a fuck of a lot and i really don't need any replacements for them. saying that i won't change is also a very naive thing to say, a person finds a way to fit in, i will create new sayings, go home and say things to Ben that he just won't get. all of the many in jokes that everyone will have and use and there is just silence when told. thats when it will be uncomfortable. i just really don't want this to happen. Maybe we will all come home after a term at uni and meet up all of us and we will just all fall back into our 17 year old selves. that would be an awsome blast from the past."

"event","so it was friday and ben wouldn't stop talking about how much he didn't want me to go to life because i would get killed there. it was Sophie Green's birthday party on Saturday night and we were going around bars and clubs in Leicester and then stopping at the holiday inn. The idea of going around Leicester late at night scares me as i hate that whole scene. the fighting, the flirtatious nature of ugly boys and the mass alcohol intake. Saturday came and i went to town earlier so i could buy my grandmas birthday present. i get into Bosworth to catch my bus and realise i don't have my drivers licence and i look about seven years of age. ARGGHH! i think about going back home to get it but then think ""no no grandmas birthday"". so i walk through the hail to get my bus and sit at the back on my own for an hour thinking about everything that has been going on for the past two weeks, about the night ahead and ofcourse about the arrival of summer. the 153 has a river running through it when it is the maga old one from th eearly 80's, you have to watch your sleeves otherwise they end up in a puddle formulating on your seat.

I get into town and wonder around hoping that i find something for grandma in the ten minutes to closing time i still have available to me. i look around and then buy her Norah Jones' first album, I thought that she would appreciate the ""OOOOooooOOOoooooOOOoooooo"" in sunrise. i can't really remember where i went then i remember being in Woolworths quite abit. i went to Cafe Nero and had a smelly but really great cheesy melting sandwich it was great. i also had a near cold hot chocolate as well, the best part of being there was the whip cream. i spend my last 20 minutes before having to meet everyone searching for an open shop that sold headache tablets for georgina. i bought some off this horribly large, massive faced, BIG red lipped lady in a spar shop. I walked to the holiday inn already being intimidated by people on the streets drinking cider from cans at ten to seven. i get to holiday inn and no one is there yet. i wait for a bit and then spy my friends walking in the opposite way up the road and i shout and run after them.

we all sat inside waiting for everyone placing bets on who would arrive first and last. when all there we went up to our rooms and jumped on beds organising who is sleeping where. Rachel and i started to make tea right the way. Sophie put on some party playlist she had made for us to listen to when we were getting ready. Henrietta and Natalie went to a shop to get wine and such like. Lydia sat with her open suitcase getting out her many outfits and Georgina sat on the bed with me and we took pictures of everyone. Sophie had champagne and she wanted to open that when her sister ALICIA (fit babe) got there so we attempt to open the blossom hill with the shittest bottle opener EVER. it kept fucking up and so i decided to carve the cork out with a knife. it took me about twenty minutes but i did it without getting one piece of cork in the bottle. my prize was a gone off breadstick. yum. we left the hotel room after being rang up by reception telling us they had been informed of a party going on in our room. i suppose eight girls getting ready to go out could sound alot like a party.

we went and got some money out and our first stop was the turkey cafe. we all got drinks and stood about chatting. Lydia wanted to set georgina, nat and i up with people from around. Lydia pointed out a chavy blonde and i said ""nooo Wayyayayyy"". i drank a classy drink full of fruit and sophie chatted to her sister and her sisters friends. i bet she fancied one of them. i don't really remember what they looked like now. after a while henri, geo and i went up to get cocktails which we asked for and i got asked for i-d. SHIT MOTHER FUCKER QUIM, ""i forgot it mate, nevermind. cheers anyway"" she tells some other woman and this woman says i have to get off the premisses how fucking annoying i am eighteen for fucks sake. i am the eldest out of the three that went up and they already sold me a drink. i go upstairs and tell the others and we slowly make our way out and up to fire fly. we all get i-ded and the fact i didn't have mine made no difference. by this time we have met up with Adele and Joe and we all walk to Glass House, on the way meeting Sarah Payne, Mel and her friends from Twycross. we all get into Glass House except for joe, him and adele sit in Les Iguanas drinking. Sophie goes out of Glass House to see them and Joe has a face like a slapped arse. We all hang out upstairs in Glass House with people. occasional visitors, see Amy Bratton after two years it was very very awkward. See Eve Devlyn (sophie's competition) in the toilets and she tells her friend how cool Georgina and i are. She tells us that she loves us. They were very drunk. we get thrown out of Glass House upstairs because it is closing and we decide to go pick up some horrible fatty fast food. We go first next door to see Adele and Joe and hang with them. That was a good time. Adele licked Sophie's leg i wish i had seen it and taken a picture but you never know i may have one my disposible was up for grabs left in the charge of no one. i can't wait to get the pictures back. i was feeling very wobbly by now and stumbled to the toilets by myself. i started to sing ""all at sea"" and i was hitting notes that i have never been able to hit before. if i wasn't drunk i would have heard what i really sounded like.

We went to ""T.J's Burgers"" and i told everyone before we went in that this was the place my sister found ants in her burgers. no one seemed to care. we all got crazy massive fatty meals and Lydia kept eating my chips because hers didn't have salt. Kt Tunstall - Suddenly I See came on the radio in there and we all sang together and i got really excited. Sophie ""See, i must be really drunk i am singing along to Kt Tunstall"" i love her. Sophie did a little speech whilst Kt still played in the background. she spoke about how happy the evening had made her because we were all together all best friends in the same place having a great time. we missed adele not being there and sophie wouldn't stop saying how bad she felt because adele wasn't with us. we missed ben but he's a boy so it didn't matter too much. After the terrible (but really tasty) food we went to Mosh. Sophie wanted to go in and see Alicia and her friends do a gay kiss so georgina and Henri went with. Natalie, Lydia, Rachel and i all went back to the hotel bar and sat talking about various things whilst eating crisps that cost me 80p. i had another archers and lemonade and started to feel really sleepy. i lay down on the seats and after a while we went up to the room. we got changed and sat around with the tv on at about 1am. Hard - Fi came on and i took too many photos to rub it in that sophie was missing it. We buggered about and Lydia and I did some spooning before the others got back at three something. They were smelly and sweaty. Sophie was sick in her hair in mosh and Henri had a shower as soon as she got in. Georgina told us about a wierdo asian guy in the corridoor who asked them what number room we were in so Lydia and I went out there causiously with a coat hanger to batter him with. After more spooning which Sophie kept falling out of bed at, we all decided it was time for bed. Georgina and i slept together, Sophie and Lydia slept together and the other three went to the other room down the way. The evening was a great success.

The next day we all woke up Henrietta had already gone to work what a nutta, ""who wants to buy a gift from Thornton at this time of day?"". It took us ages to get up and go but when we did it was all so fun. we went to Yo-Yo's for breakfast and i ate far too much. i bet i have put on all the weight i have lost in the past two years over sophies birthday. We left Yo-Yo's and walked down the main street past this amazing parade, all the indian people in leicester were out there with floats singing. it was pretty, it was very orange. i took loads of pictures. Sophie's dad picked us up and we sat in the car all together. We were sat at some traffic lights and we were all singing quietly along to The Killers - Mr Brightside. Sophie's dad looked out of his window and the man in the next car was singing too. He was putting his all into it and Me and Sophies sister laughed alot. we went the long way round to not get in the queues at desford and newbold and Georgina and I started to feel sick. We dropped Rachel off and Georgina and I were last. Sophie had a great birthday i think and i hope we made it good for her. i think that we did.

I sure do hope that she has washed her hair now. slut. LOVER.
i apologise for the length of this but you know now you will remember it."

I can't be bothered to go into what has made it a bad day as i think that they don't deserve the recognition and allow them to know that they effected me and my day so badly. I have done so much that has made the last 36hours absolutely amazing but now i can only allow the bad things to cask a dark shadow over the great things.

Whoever said that she is a real twat makes me boil up inside, if you can bring yourself to say this then you don't even know her at all... you would be telling a lie that is fooling yourself and influencing no others.

My eyes welled up with tears when it happened and i shouted expletives of complete irritation and walked away, i thought why is she late and well were shall i go, i walked home rather than took my lift. I wish i had driven.
I got better as i walked listebning to music that got my anger up to a hightened level and then chilling back out with another track. 

I walked on no cracks and a boy became a hazard in my line, i slowed my walking pace for the old man. i would never walk off my line.

Me and Ben sing well together i think it should work out... x
(I am sad that you are not here.)"

"event","here is how my waiting for the bus went.
Hannah Congrave a 17 year old girl sits on a wooden bench next to the bus shelters, she is wearing jeans, pink converse shoes, a white shirt with a pink flowery pattern and her hair is tied up. She is listening to ""Nirvana Unplugged in New York - plateau"", both headphones are in her ears. She takes drinks from a green sprite bottle regulaly and is eating some cherry flavoured chewits. She sits there for about ten minutes flicking through her newly developed holiday photographs. Suddenly, she is being asked a question by a stranger. A 55-60 year old woman in a blue and white stripped t-shirt and blue cotton trousers with white stitching pulling behind her a blue case (the types that older women have so they don't have to carry plastic bags full of shopping and their short mat bowls equiptment around with them, for this would stress their week muscles.) She begun.

WomAn: excuse me do you know if the little cresswells bus has gone yet?

Hannah: oh, urm i am not sure what number is it?

Woman: it's a little white one ... number 7!

Hannah: oh, no it hasn't thats the one i'm wiating for.

Woman: oh that's ok then i have about run here, my friend said that it was 20 to. Her watch must be fast and , ouuuu!! you wait till the next time i see her. Its hot today isn't it? yes its vey hot!

Hannah: yeah, i know its crazy...

Woman: Crazy?? why?

Hannah doesn't know what to say to this and realises that language has been effected so badly that we begin to drop useless comments like this into conversation. so she chose to ignore it and say;

Hannah: well, it is meant to get cooler by saturday.

Woman: ohh, we shall be ok then.

Hannah sit there and get back to her music. The women begins to mubble something and rooting arouund in her bag so hannah takes out a headphone. 

Woman: i've got to show you this, i've just got to. if i can find it. i bought it in scope yesturday and left it on the counter. it will be in here somewhere.

Hannah doesn't know what to expect as this woman is clearly starting to paint a picture for herself as being yet again another crazy person from Atherstone. She pulls out a white teddy bear in a blue dressing gown purched on a stick! She makes hannah touch it and see how soft it is and wants hannah to say HOW GREAT IT IS!!! Hannah notices another really sacry woman with bad teeth and very srange clothes come over. 

I will come out of screenplay mode because i am abit tired of it. BUT, these two woman start talking and they know each other and have a chat. the meeting goes on and then the woman sat next to me tells me some crazy shit, she starts telling me about how she started to go to this DATING club (shes a sixty year old stranger) and she met this man and he didn't leave her alone and he used to send her 50 text messages a day and all this stuff about how she was harrassed by him and i DO NOT want to know! she was going on about all this personal stuff and all i wanted to do was listen to nirvana. ARRGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! atherstone people piss me off!!!!!!"

"event","Hello, 
me and my grandma were just chatting about going on holiday to Wales with mum and dad and we have agreed that if they annoy us we can go and find a new cottage to live in for the remainder of the week haha i just hink we should do that anyway. 
I didn't go to school today as i really just felt ill and wanted to get better for my exams as i can see people saying, ""who was that coughing all the way through the exam!!!"" and i would feel bad! I got up this morning and did loads of jobs around the home for my parents and then mum got back from where ever it was she had been. I did all the ironing for her while she did some marking for work and then had lunch. She went out at 1.00 and i could see the rest of the day only getting better, for they would be out for the evening wooohooo! i thought i would clear my head before i sat down to do my homework in preperation for my exams and decoded to go on a walk. i got my dickies bag, my mp3 player, my house key, a pen and a pad of paper and walked out the door. 
i went to the park at 1.15pm and looked for locations ben and I could use for our film. i took out he pad and sat on the freshly cut grass of the football field. i wrote it down and sketched down places in my head for different scenes in the film. i walked to the first field and went along the public footpath across another field, which by the way, as a child myself, adele and sam, were shot at by the crazy farmer. i carried on along this field crossed a bridge and went to another field. the views were spactacular the sun was hsining so brightly it was blinding and i just felt free and well. the music made me feel calm and as i walked along i could just imagine the film that we are making and how beautiful it will actually be. so i follow the track and get to a sign tellingh me to go through this field with a big fuck off huge BULL in it. it was like a bull out of a cartoon, it had big fuck off horns and a ring in its nose. i swear i could have shit my self but i wasn't gonna just go home now so i went in the field. SO, i start running to the other side of the field and jump over the gate and crash into the ground, to only look back and see that he most bothered animal in the field was a tiny lamb. the bull wasn't fazed by my presence at all. i found muyself then in the biggest field i hink i have evr seen it was sufferening from drought i think it had shit little crops in it and i got worried because i couldn't tell where the path was and wasn't. I hate this aspect of walking on public footpaths as i don't want to get in trouble with farmers for tresspassing and all that. i walk to the end of this field and then i started to get lost as i didn't know where to go from there. i carried on following the tyre tracks of the trackter and walked across the field and then i was completely lost i jumped across a bank and into another field and then started to run beacsue i knew i wasn't meant to be walking along there. i could see scary farmers with guns coming to get me and take me away in my imagination.
I see a gate and think wooohoooo! finally a way out, LEGALLY, and its a bridleway and i think thank god, i think i know where i am. so i walk along this bridleway path that is like a road and i wakl for ages and get nowhere i can see nuneaton hill and the 3m's tower and i can see ""smiths garage"" and ""The Red Lion"" in the distance.I'M IN FUCKING PINWALL!!!! which by the way to all you who don't have a clue where pinwall is it is a bit of a drive from sheepy. so i finally get off this bridle path and on to a national speed limit road with no path! i am in a bad state i haev been walking stressed out for 2hours and finally when i know where i am, i could be hit by a car at any moment! i finally get home and then my grandma arrives and makes me tea and tells me to go to sleep beacuse i have been on a long walk, she seems to forget that i am only 17 and a long walk isn't going to take me weeks to get over. It just makes me want to go to Wales and walk for miles and miles and i swear i will!
bye bye xxxxxxx I AM DEFO GOING TO SCHOOL TOMORROW !!!!"

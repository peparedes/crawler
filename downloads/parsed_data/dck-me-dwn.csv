"event","Im so pissed man4l isnt with mee anymore he says that we need a break because i checked his messages then tried to lie about it and he said that he cant be with anyone that he cant trust. I dont know what I should do I want to apologize but I want this apology to really let him know that I am sorry and that I can change to better our relationship.I just dont know what to do right now i can give advice to everyone ekse but not to my self when i need it the most.im tired of being like this and im tired of messing over a perfectly good man that cares for me just as much as i care for him. I need to do something to show him that I really am sorry and that I want to be with him just as much as i say that i do and even more.  There is someone that Im worried about lets call her KG she ran away and i think i now where she is but she needs to know that she cant keep running from her issues its not good I tried to talk some sense to her but it didnt work.  TTYL THE REALIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Man my heart is really catching hell this guy I'll call CS26 that I use to talk to has moved on and left me behind. I brought it all on myself though and I really can't blame him for it. CS26 went to church with me on one sunday and my boyfriend was there so to avoid looking as though I was cheating I went and talked to my boyfriend instead of sitting with him. I knew it was bold and after the fat i felt bad about it. Them I asked and he said that it didn't bother him but I knew he wasn't being honest. I really like him and now I don't even have him anymore and I don't think that he really cares. So now he's talking to this girl who is sheisty because she talked all that time about how me and boy CS26 looked so cute together and now shes talking to him. What a BITCH!!! same damn thing I said. But I don't even know what it is, its like I just grew so attached to him he did everything I asked, kisses hugs, and all the affection that I never had in a relationship. I was so ready to be with him as a couple. I guess it just wasnt meant to be. its like every guy I try to talk to I fuck it up some how. But I never thought that if he did find out that it would even matter since we werent together. Im scared to talk to him I dont know whaat hes going to say or do and I want him to be honest but I dont think that he would. He'll try to hoe me or end up never talking to me agian.Ok well thats enough of that!! Then there is my biggest crush and he still is. I want him so bad but he has a girlfriend. Right same thing I said FUCK HIS GIRL I WANT HIM!!!! But thats not the case I want him to leave her and I want him to be with me. He wants me and I know it but he loves her and love can do some awfully crazy stuff. Trust me I know That If I dont know anything else. I think that Im going to tell him that. I think abotu him no matter what I do I tried to make him jealous of boy CS26 but it didnt work. I just like him so much and I dont know what to do with myself. But you know CS26 Im really missing him right now and I just cant control it I just want to palm him face and kiss him until he cant stand it anymore and gives in and takes me in the bathroom and does exactly what he wants with me. YA'LL JUST DONT KNOW!!!!! I dont know what Im going to do until next time.
   YOU'LL NEED ME BEFORE I'LL NEED YOU!!! CHOW!!!!!!!!"

"event","Hello people this is one of the realist people you will ever find.Thanks to those viewing my first entry.Shiesty is at the top because females are just that. You never know when you come across a real one. Let me tell you my situation, this kid which will always remain nameless I'll call her Jane Doe. she lied on me to this guy then tried to blame it on someone else. Not only that because that is beside the true point of this story. She also fucked over some of her other friends. then she expects us to be cool. Hell no I think  that i have suffered long enough, and our friendship is long over due. So now she is mad because I don't talk to her anymore. but everything she is going through she did to herself. It might sound heartless but I don't even care at this point. She is always depressed and sad and I don't need that in my life because I am on my way to college and i don't need anyone else's drama in my life when I'm dealing with my own. I don't even think that she knows  that she hurt me and I'm upset as hell but I don't stress about it because I don't want to be depressed because my friend betrayed me oe the 3rd time since I have known her but as I always say this too shall pass. !!!!!!!until next time!!!!!!!!"

"event","ah ok. so had my pensacola layover yesterday. we got in at like 2 or so. ashley and i went straight to the beach. well straight to get cigarretes then to the beach.  
Then we decided to go get a drink so we headed up to ""the dock"" a restaurant bar on the beach. yeah 100 to 1.50 for a beer and like 3 bucks for liquor drinks it was nice.
then a few guys from the airforce came up there and started talking with us, and cameron randomly showed up so that was nice. He flys for free also since i am a flight attendant. 
so he calls me and its like this 
Cam-""what are you doin?"" 
Me- ""layin on the beach.""  
Cam- ""yeah im gonna take a nap i think."" 
so we get off the phone and he calls back in like an hour and a half 
Me- ""how was your nap?"" 
Cam- ""fine im just hangin at the house now what are you doing?""
Me- ""were chillin at this restaurant."" 
Cam-""oh whats it called?""  
Me- ""The dock""  
Cam-""seaside bar and grill?"" 
Me-"" oh youve stayed down here before?"" 
Cam-"" naw. why dont you come outside and see me"" 
hahaha
yeah so i proceed to go outside and cameron is just standing there. just hopped on a plane to pensacola found out what hotel i was stayin at and everything. pretty impressive. nice surprise.
ANYWAYS. so all 7 of us hang out at this bar for awhile then we head next door to this restaurant called crabs. Cameron me, the flight attendant i was flyin with(ashley) and the 4 airforce people ( josh dave shane and christine)  we get this bigass table and just have a great time with great food. got everyone up in the bar to sing the thundercats themesong...let the parrot smoke....hung out like we'd all been friends for YEARS.  basically had a badass time. I love this job. well i meant to take more pics...and honestly thought i had,  somewhere during the night some got deleted by accident when trying to make space on my camera, and then i forgot i had a camera :) but there is a coupla new pics on my webshots website and they are super fun so go check em out.
yeah then this morning we had one 50 minute flight home then we were done....oh what a hard days work :)
pensacola was a blast. im going to start looking for trips there in open time and pick them up. i love it. i love the beach i love the restaurants i love the hotel. :)

Found out my raise actually put me up to 20.50 an hour. yay for unexpected money.

I think my car is dying. but not that it matters. considering my license is suspended till october.:) but that is the car that cameron drives since he doesnt have one so it could be a problem. cuz he is my main mode of transportation. considering applying for a hardship license also. could be a big fat waste of my time.

every month as a flight attendant you bid for your schedule. you pick what you want where you want to go who you want to fly with etc etc etc. you dont have to pick who you fly with but you can. its called buddy bidding or triple bidding. (buddy bid to just have one friend you fly with triple bid for 2. there are 3 flight attendants on every flight) so anyways. I triple bid for june with 2 kickass girls. ive flown with both of them once before and we had such a great time. bids come out the 17th. I hope we get it. It will be so badass and we will get into so much trouble. its gonna be fun. :)

most of my  trips for the rest of may are only 2 days. one overnight. pretty sweet. and ive got 5 days off in a row at the end of the month including camerons birthday. Hell be 22. his brothers comin down and it should be a pretty good party. not that we dont already have at least one a weekend anyway :)

ah well anyways thats about it. i posted some new pics from a recent party here and you can see some of the new house in them. check em out.

I took a few pictures but not many. ill post them probly tomorrow on my pic website. because im a lazy ass and my camera is in the other room. oh and cuz lost comes on in like 5 minutes.
Anyways we ate at the rainforest cafe which was pretty awesome...but i was still kinda drunk from the plane ride (woot woot sat in business class free drinks) and i forgot to bring my camera to the restaurant.
The disney villages were alot of fun they were setting up for mardi gras. then we just drove the hour and a half to vero beach and went to the hotel, up bright and early and spent all day at ""dodgertown"" where the tryouts were being held and then came home tonight. oh woopdeedoo :)

Im off for the next 5 day s which is always fun. Were headed down to orlando tomorrow. but not for work. for fun. well kindof. cameron has a baseball tryout down there (he wont be playing down there if he makes it who knows where hell be playing) anyways so we are going down and meeting his dad down there and staying for a coupla days. hence the hopefully he will be able to pay me back soon :) seeing as he makes it.

Hopefully ill get my moveup line this month. which means crew scheduling will stop owning me and life will be much much easier :) I still love my job tho.
I did get an awesome schedule for march. I got my 21st birthday off (3-11 baby!) and my cousins wedding and of course these first 5 days at the beginning of the month to go with cameron to orlando.

ah well thats about it. mostly just working and such. hope life is grand for everyone else!

oh also. just to make a point. I ran across something adorable the other day. It wasnt voiced towards me, i dont even really know the person but come on....i believe any idiot who feels the need to plaster on the internet or vocalize the fact that ""they are better than everyone (or anyone for that matter"" wow has some serious issues. i mean sure alot of us think that we are better than people or even think we KNOW we are, but to be like that about it?! hahaha wow. you have some serious self esteem issues. Then of course on the other hand if you are a person who decides to do this and you are fat and a bitch and in no way attractive (I mean do you own NO MIRRORS?!) and have probly the worst most boring personality of any person ever.....well thats just damn embarrasing for you now that you did that and everyone is laughing at you behind your back  isnt it? :)

I was in minneapolis st. paul last week on one of my layovers, so we went to the mall of america all day...that was fun! I posted pictures on my website so go check em out. It was a good trip and a good crew....4 days tho, so very tiring.  

so im looking thru our flicka website, dont even ask too complicated, and the main point is you can see everyother flight attendants seniority and line award....anyways most of our most senior flight attendants (guarenteed they have been here 10 years but whts that really matter) schedules consist of this...18-21 days off a month and no layovers. lol yeah they work like 2 days and they are off for 5. hahaha and are still making at least over 3,000 bucks a month. im not sure how much more cuz i wasnt sure on how to do the math but thats the LEAST they are making working like 10 days a month. hahahaha

So i did my bids for february...(we bid every month for the line we work the next month) yeah i went and bid for all weekends off just to see if id get it, cuz thats usually what everyone bids for....then i DID get it and realized FUCK. number one id totally forgotten about bidding for valentines day off ( not that i care but my boyfriend of 3 years is not too happy about that one haha i know im such a guy) so totally forgot about v-day AND the only show i really give a rats ass about, but when i say i give a rats ass, its more like im fucking obsessed and crack couldnt control me more than this show, comes on WEDNESDAY nights and i have NO wednesdays off. yes the show is LOST ladies and gentlemen. i seriously go into withdrawals when i havnt seen it. like over christmas when we went like 4 weeks with only reruns. and i had to watch those just to keep myself sane. im obsessed. ah well but i got all weekends off LOL 

well anyways. thats about it. just alot of working and playing while im working. and getting paid for it. haha I love it. Hope life is grand for everyone else. loves! check out the new pics~ lizzy"

"event","Ok update. I left for a 4 day trip on Friday. My crew was awesome. It was a girl and a guy. We had so much fun it was awesome. The first night we were in sarasota florida but we had a 715 checkin so we just went to bed. Then christmas eve We got to richmond virginia at like noon  So we got to the hotel restaurant/bar and have some lunch  Then we are waiting on cameron to meet us in richmond because its christmas eve so hes going to spend 2 days with me on my trip but they got bored So we headed out to the bars. So for a little backround....we took a cab TO the bar so we didnt realize how far it was, ok so we end up at 2 different bars but spent the most time at a place called the tobacco company which was soo much fun but the drinks were SOOOO strong. And im drinking vodka all night. We wound up TANKED totally trashed. Long storys short....I ran into a butler (who was actually a guest at the restaurant) We met jesus (who was actually an older drunk couple at the bar) and took alot of awesome pictures haha which are terrible quality because i forgot my digital camera so they are from my phone but i may try to post them anyways.

So this is where the night gets fun...We decide to leave early to make sure we are back at the hotel when cameron gets there cuz i know hell get pissed if im still out when he arrives. So we are STILL all tanked. We start walking back and sooner then later realize we are totally and utterly lost. we wander around richmond virginia for like an hour at least lol Im not sure. It felt like 2. This was the issue. I realized AFTER we went out that cameron has my checkcard. so jennifer and sean spent most of their money on all of our drinks. we couldnt get a cab. I mean what i remember of it was pretty cool tho. they had all of downtown lit up with christmas lights. And there was this one park where they had like hundreds of deer made out of christmas lights set up. so of course i made us stop and take pictures. so long story short we are wandering and wandering AND WANDERING. we finally stop at this place im not sure what it was like a hotel or something to ask for directions. I proceed to do somersaults across the street. cuz its fun. but jennifer and sean wouldnt do them with me. haha anyways and apparently I managed to lay up some stairs. yeah apparently it is physically possible. ok so now weve caved and we are waiting on a cab. From there i just remember at one point sean SAW the hotel and MADE the cabbie stop. then they pour this massive amount of change in my hands and MAKE ME give it to him with some sort of apology and im not sure why. but he let us go so yay.

SO YAY WEVE MADE IT BACK TO THE HOTEL. we find out from the cabbie that we were 15 blocks from the hotel when we were at the bar. so im thinking um it felt like we walked that far...why did we not get here? to which jennifer is like no we deffinately walked further. We were just walking 15 plus blocks in CIRCLES. HAHAHA 

but there was another crew in the hotel bar so that was kewl. Insert long story about how i thought i had my checkbook and i realized after we had all gotten a few drinks ( i was gonna pay for a few of jen and seans now to pay them back) that i didnt have it and i wasnt positive cameron was bringing my checkcard so we were all like freaking out, but still drinking. ok more somersaults in the hotel bar, finding out one of my favorite flight attendants kelley was there, Cameron shows up....good times good times....:)

Ok most hilarious point of the night?
Airtran is sponsored by the new atl aquarium for these snacks we serve. They are cheese cracker whales. We are a low fare airline and we dont serve meals. So somehow the topic of annoying passengers comes up and im explaining what id LIKE to do or say to some of them.

Annoying Passenger: ""Isnt there going to be a meal on this flight?""
Me:"" Your damn right. We're havin a fish dinner. Now shut up and eat your cheese whales bitches!""

hahaha the quote for the resst of the night in place of ""fuck you"" was ""shut up and each your whales bitches""

yay for the best 4 day ever. :) yay for fun crews! sorry for the long story but i had to save this in my journal so i could look back on it someday cuz it was so much fucking fun.
Hope everyone had a lovely christmas. Im going to my parents tonight to celebrate mine. love love love love loves! AND...........



SHUT UP AND EAT YOUR WHALES BITCHES!"

"event","Ok update. got off my 4 day trip on sunday, sat ready reserve on monday from 8 pm to 1130 pm, lamest most pointless shit ever, gotta love crew scheduling. Then off tues weds thurs.

Met up with heather last night. Shes another flight attendant. She plays poker (or texas hold em) at a few places here in newnan, so cam and i went with her to the irish pub. we started at pitmasters cuz heather hadnt been there alot but when we got there NOONE was there and the place just looks low class and come to find out (surprise) nasty bass aka jessica gann works there now. how pathetic. another reason to leave. so we ended up at the irish pub. Heather took freakin 2nd place out of like 50 people. awesome. I just watched and it was cams first time at the tables so he didnt place.

So from there we went across to the alamo met up with robin, another flight attendant and chilled there for awhile....saw jay mottola there which was like the most randomest thing to me haha but i was pretty drunk. Then we were off to city limits, which was closed wtf so we headed to the corner tavern. ok we had these things there called kill bills with like absolute raspberry in it....YUM. There i saw ashley smrcina wow we used to be good friends back in highschool and fell out of touch about senior year. but i had dated her brother for awhile so we had spent alot of time together so that was pretty kool.....i forgot my digital camera so i was kinda pissed about that.

That was about it we just stayed at the corner tavern for awhile and then headed our drunk asses home to sleep. Cameron had to be up for work at like 7. so that sucked but he was home by 2 so i guess it wasnt so bad.

I have no clue where i will be for christmas but im sure it wont be here....lol I also have no clue when ill be having my christmas and getting my presents...i was thinking tonight would be the best night because  most of the family goes to my mimi's every wednesday night for dinner, but my mom didnt say anything about it so who knows. Id really rather get them before christmas than after but tomorrow is my last day off till after christmas....

anyways i guess ill go finish getting ready and head over to my mimi's see what happens from there....

merry christmas to all hope life is grand!"

 ok well i cleaned my house today. im so proud of that.

Cameron came down friday to my graduation and stayed till sunday, then monday i found out my sit time was tuesday night at 7 so i went to tampa, came back tuesday, started sitting at 7 and at 8 got my first trip and layover! woohoo! lol I was sent to memphis layover and then back this morning. then when we got into atl from memphis today they released me for the rest of the day so woohoo.
The layover was alot of fun! The other two i flew with, Don and mareesa, were fun. The hotel was awesome. everyone gets their own room,duh,  and they were like huge king size beds with down comforters and a couch and fridge and microwave etc. It was the holiday inn select which at first i was like uhhh whats this going to be like...but it was really nice. There was a workout room i never made it to lol but we got in at like 10 and then had a 930 checkin the next am so who really wants to waste any of that time working out :)

Atlanta to moline (thats in illinois)
Moline to Orlando
Orlando to moline
Moline to atlanta

(they dont do layovers for your o.e.)
My checkin is at 855 am, the trip leaves atlanta at 955 am and gets back into atlanta that night at about 830.
woohoo :) I cannot wait for my first layover :) yay yay yay. im so excited. Thank you to everyone for the love and support. yall are awesome. im so excited. im so happy. hopefully cameron will make it in tomorrow and be there to take graduation pictures, if not ill just take some afterwards. :) my mom and dad are both working but thats ok graduation isnt that huge of a deal because over the majority of the classes are from out of town alot and the families cant make it in because free flight privileges for your ""companion"" and your parents dont actually start till 30 days after your graduation. i keep my flight priveleges because i was already an employee, so my people just keep flying whenever they want. anyways. yay! :) 4 weeks of stressing and worrying are all over :) i hope everyone else is doin great!"

"event","Ahhh soooo flight attendant training is going well. im super excited but super anxious all the time. They really dont give you an inch in training and they really dont play. you really have to be on your toes. from being late to appearance checks  to grades on the tests....and etc.

But it is alot of fun. the first 2 days have been kindof slow....tomorrow we start the real nitty gritty shit. and we have our first test. Theres quite a few kewl people in my class. And may i say without offending anyone i am in love with gay men. hahaha I swear all the male flight attendants that ive met that are gay, and the new ones in myclass are just so so so much fun. they are so open and so nice and honest and sarcastic and downright hilarious. And they are really some of the nicest sweetest people. I love them! haha

Ah well not much else goin on, tomorrow is day three. and seeing as its 930 and i still have to shower and blowdry my hair and sstudy for tomorrows test i will leave this boring entry at that :)

IM SO EXCITED BUT IM SO SCARED AND SO ANXIOUS AND NERVOUS!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!

hope all is well with all of you lovely people :)"

"event","Ah well update update. i really am too lazy. so here is my short update. Tonight was my last night on the gates. it was soooo soooo soooo sad. Im going to miss everyone so much. really as a gate agent at airtran especially on the night shift everyone just gets so close and people are quite like family. I mean you spend the majority of all your days with them. its so sad. but i will see them again as im flyin in and out im sure.

Well flight attendant training starts on monday. gettin up at 6 am and havin to study so much is gonna SUCK. but a change of pace will be nice. its 8-5 every day with saturday/sunday off (unless im doing observation flights) for the next four weeks. ok im lazy and thats all im sayin cept i already miss all my airtran family on the gates!!! :) hope everyone is doing GREAT."

"event","Ah, im such a neglectful journal owner. but who really cares. Not much goin on. Workin. as usual. it owns my life. My training date for flight attendant is steadily approaching...psyched but dreading that shit at the same time.
Its not that the training is known to be HARD its just ALOT of information to remember in 4 weeks. you have to study and we all know how much i love that shit. Plus the classes are so terribly boring and LONG and they start at 8 in the morning and dont get out till 5. and with my adhd (attention deficit hyperactive disorder for those who are clueless :)) it makes for loads of fun for me. AND if i dont pass training theyve put this new bullshit into effect where you cannot return to your previous postition with airtran. bullshit. makes no sense and completely fucking stupid and unfair if you ask me.
So usually for every 35 flight attendants they hire 10-12 fail. so we are all crossing our fingers i do fine. and PASS. In the meantime im thinking of taping my wrists before class each day so i dont slit them out of boredom and sheer misery.

anyways i did my physical and drug test and hpe all today. im SUPER excited ill start flying around the end of october when it gets cold so how lame will thos layovers in florida be by then :)
I am excited that inflight has an agreement with dell, so you get a laptop and furnish it up to 1600, put no money down and no interest they simply take 50 bucks out of each paycheck. hot shit right there if you ask me. DUDE im gettin a dell. haha that way ill always have a computer..haha ill update yall while im on my layovers by the pool in miami or in the casion is las vegas LOL

So october 3rd. thats the big date. if i get my passport by then. not much else goin on....so yeah yay for that update :) hope all is well with the world!"

"event","AHHHH TRANS SIBERIAN ORCHESTRA TOURDATES ARE OUT! 

WOOT WOOT! TSO!

ok so the countdown begins...even though i fly for free i believe ive decided on Sunday, November 13, birmingham alabama. This being the reason. that will be my last week of training for flight attendant.  After that date ill be reserve which means that basically for the next 3-6 mos the flight attendant supervisors/ crew tracking/crew scheduling own me and i have no life haha. while you are on reserve you must be within 2 hours of the airport at all times they can call you at any time. make no plans have no life is basically your motto on reserve. so anyways in order to continue my faithful yearly attendance to tso, and seeing as they are not playin in atlanta this year (what the fuck is up with that) birminham alabama is the next best:) not a bad drive. ah anyways. im so pumped. who all wants to go? They will fucking rock your world. youll want to go every year i swear.

MARK YOUR CALENDARS. oh and all the other tour dates are on the official site :)

THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS"

"event","So....disregard like last two journal entries...total change of plans...kind of long and drawn out...Dont really feel like postin it...I.m. me or something and maybe ill share a little.

Long story short...
Whats worse being alone or staying with someone you are no longer happy with just to keep from being alone? 
The answer to that question made me realize some decisions I had to make, and make quick before things got harder. Camerons back down in florida, hopefully his family will let him move back in...
Im still going for flight attendant...but not moving as of now...

anyways Things are a little rough and scary and hard right now, but sometimes you know what you have to do, even if it is hard."

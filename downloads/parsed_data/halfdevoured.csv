"event","My new band, Mad at My Desk, is going to be sharing the stage with my best friend's band, Suns Collide, at Sky City in downtown Augusta, GA. It's the CD release party for Suns Collide and man, are they going to be tired because 3/4 of their band is in my band, too!

 It's all happening on March 27th. I need to get busy!"

"event","I'm back! Writing. Sharing. Thinking. Living. Breathing. And, of course, nerdy.

I will post something here at last once each week, but I hope to do so more often than that.

And hey, Dear Reader, I've missed you as much as I've missed myself.

More soon.

Love,
Stephen"

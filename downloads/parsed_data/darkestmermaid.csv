"event","So. I guess I might as well discuss the past few days. They're clearly the best days of my life. Hot sun, warm water, awesome friends. What could be better?

Sunday: We left a bit late that morning. The sun was out, clearly foreboding the lovely days to come. We rocket down to Virginia Beach, on our way discussing interesting topics... Like sticking big toes in asses. After arriving, we scanned the strip and hit the beach. Mini-golf finished the evening before we allowed ourselves to succumb to sleep. Amazing start to an amazing trip.

Monday: It was a similar day, complete with beach bumming, fooding, and strip-scanning. There was a 3D funhouse that was a ripoff. $5, and you can't even keep the glasses. We then forfieted for the night and played Monopoly until no one was interested anymore. I guess that was because I cried and gave up the two properties that would ensure Andrew's success at creating an ultimate monopoly spanning over two sides of the board. Then we watched the Twilight Zone marathon until we couldn't keep our eyes or minds open anymore.

Tuesday (AKA 4th of July): Breakfast was quite interesting, as it usually was. By interesting, I mean quite crappy. But it as altogether a late start, as we rushed in the evening to make it to the fireworks. We beached with our newly bought inflatable boats, skipped lunch, and headed to a waterpark. It was a cute place, I must say, but after getting my ass and vagina raped at the same time on this one water slide, we decided it was time to go. Then the shit hit the fan. We took too long in the shower and then scrambled to find a place to eat. Nothing looked good enough, and everything else had long waits. We settled on the one place that looked okay, but we shortly found out that nothing would be okay when tempers were high and stomachs were growling madly. We left with a bang, underpaying, upturning pasta dishes, spilling drinks... Actually the mess was Andrew, but we supported him. We finally relaxed as we watched the fireworks. A good show, I'll say. The night was closed by huge ice cream cones and 3D mini-golf. More Twilight Zone followed, until sleep conquered.

Wednesday: Very late start. We skipped breakfast, as it was just not worth rousing for. We got ready to go to a nice place to eat - Catch 31. It was the best decision we made on food ever. It truly made up for the terrible meals of the previous day. We then enjoyed Virginia Beach one last time. Then we shifted to the pool. And finally, we had dinner with the Lohses. I love steak, by the way. After we ate, we scoured the strip for little gifts for loved ones at home. We also toured the haunted funhouse... I was very freaked out because I hate shit like that, but I laughed a lot regardless. We ended with Scrabble and went to bed. 

Thursday: We packed the van and began our drive home. Much laughing and irritation ensued at my childish whining about coconut shrimp, villas, Lorenzo, and kisses. Perhaps I am a bit of a whiner, but it kept Sir Jono the Driver awake. But I really do want a gate to keep warriors out. Home again, home again, jiggety jig. 

So, I didn't mean to write so much about the trip. Once I started typing, everything came out. It was marvelous. And I can't wait to do something like that again. Jason, Jono, Andrew, and Amanda, you kids make my life."

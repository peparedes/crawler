"event","Well today was a lil more interesting. I had to get up at 6 in the morning so i could go to school and take a mandatory hearing and vision screening (whop-di-do...). First i had to wait in line at the nurses office so i could fill out a form, then i had to go to a different building, wait in line, and take the hearing test.It was kinda hard cause it was a lot quieter then i thought it would be. At first i wasn't sure if i was actually hearing the tones or if it was just all in my head (lol) and then the lady's cell phone that was screening me went off! Next it was off to the vision test where i had to wait in an even longer line! First i had to read the lit up letters on the screen with both eyes (which was pretty easy) then i had to do it with one eye closed. The ""K""s looked like ""B""s and the ""C""s looked like ""Q""s and well.... i don't think i did to well on that test (i've been wearing glasses since the 3rd grade and i can't wait cause i'm going to be getting contacts soon!). Anywho, then me and my mom were going to go to some place to do some ""running-around"" and i thought to call Ashley aka Giggles (my best bud!<3) to see if she knew that she was supposed to go for her screening at 10. Well, she didn't and she needed a ride so being the kind person my mother is (LMAO!!!) she agreed to give her a ride. So then my mom and i went to Staples (i got a new color ink printing cartridge!lol) and then to ""Pick-and-Save"" aka Big Lots (i put 50cents into one of those machines where u turn the lil dial a get a cheap prise in one of those clear egg looking things, and i got a silver colored dragon necklace! sorry i'm easily amused), Then off to Ashleys house we went, picked her up, and then headed for the school again. The lines were even longer this time so we had to wait for her to finish, then my mom drove us to the mall and dropped us off. We were going to by tickets to see the Pirates of the Caribean (for the 2nd time)but it didn't open till 11:30 and it was only 10:30. So we went to Claires and got matching fairy ""best-friends"" necklaces (there soooo cute!) then we went to Spencers so she could show me the ""huge balls she found"" (the necklaces with the metal balls, u now wat i'm talking about). Then it was off to the pet store where they had the cutest lil beagle u've ever seen! Then we went to the food court for lunch (i got a turkey and provolone sandwich from Subway, but Ashley didn't have nething (she said she wasn't hungery)). Then we went to go get out=r tickets but the movie didn't start for an hour, but we thought wat the heck and decided to go in neway. We got 2 large Sprites (not a very good idea for those with a weak blatter) and got the best seats in the movie theater, and then we waited...and waited....and waited. Finally the movie starts and about half way through i realise that i realllllly have to pee. So i hold it until Ashley says that she does too and then she reminded me that we had to watch all the credits too cause there was son=me thing she desperatly wanted to see after them. Sooooo....towards the end of the movie i just can't hold it any longer so i leave to go to the bathroom. Then when i come back Ashley has to go, so by the time she comes back it's already the credits. So we wait and start dancing to the music playing during the credits cause we're bored to death and ther's practically no one else in there. Finally it gets to the end and all it is is the monkey stealling some treasure and going totally ballistic (definitley not worth the wait!). So then we look around the mall a lil bit more (i got a chocolate gumball but it tasted alot like a tootsie roll) and Ashley says that there is this one store that has face plates that fit my cell phone (now u have to realise that i hav been looking for covers everywhere and havn't been able to find a single one, so i was pretty excited)! So we're heading up the escalater when my mom calls and says that she's waiting out front in the car to pick us up. Ashley and i quickly look in the store and find that they have the exact one that i've been looking for (clear blue). But i couldn't buy it cause my mom was waiting. So we sprint to the exit, get in the car and go to ashley's house so she can change her pants and shoes and get her sax (she goes to band camp). Then we were off to the school...again! We drop her off and then head for home. Later that night i went out with my mom to pick up Panda Xpress (i got orange chicken and mandarin chicken...yuuuummmmmmy!) and i got a fortune cookie that said ""You will recieve good news from afar"" wat ever that means. ttyl! lnnlc <-- my rock on sign ""l"" is the pinky ""nn"" are the ring and middle fingers ""l"" is the pointer and ""c"" is the thumb, do u see it?! ;P"

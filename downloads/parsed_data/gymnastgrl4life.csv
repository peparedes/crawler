"event","<P>So college is goin well right now, despite some of the drama that is still going on, things are deffinatly better then they were b4! I went home for the weekend and realized that Carroll College Parties SUCK ASS!!!! you have to walk like a million miles from the campus, and then when you get to the party theres nobody there, and its just boring and it sucks....GAY! </P>
<P>Saturday was a good day, Worked til 4, then got a new cell phone, and hung out with Tony too....its so nice to be able to be friends with him now, you have no idea how much better that makes me feel and how much that brings up spirits up. Now i really have someone to talk to, and someone to tell me i'm being stupid and someone I know will tell me the truth. Thank you for visitin me in Tuesday, and thank you for the good night on Satuday Tony. It made my life at the moment a whole lot better. Now that things are mended with him...just gotta work on Brandon...HAHAHA NOT!!~ He's a duche bag and can rot in hell for all&nbsp;I care. Him and his new girlfriend can be happy I dont really care too much anymore, I've got better things to worry about, and better things to do with my time rather then worring bout Brandon...he's not really my type anyways, I dont know why I really fell for him anyway..can someone tell me????? Yeah he was nice and all but I dunno it just doenst seem like I shoulda made that choice during the summer...but I'm good right now being single and doin what I want...I'm having a blast....thank god I'm back up at school...this weekend wasnt too great...</P>
<P>As for Chris...things are just weird with that, I hardly talk to him now, and I dunno..i.ts kinda odd..since I'm friends with all the guys on his floor and I'm over there to visit Andrew a lot..well at least last week I was.....Well I'm off to write a paper, just wanted to make a lil update on my life right now, and say a few things that have been on my mind...</P>"

"event","This weekend ROCKED, Friday night...drank a lil bit on my floor with Kim, Mel, Kim's Boyfriend Joel, Courtney, and some other people I dont know...then we went out to someones house, there really wasnt anything goin on there, so we left...and went over to South Scott and hung out with the boys...drank some more..and stuff, Chris got soooooo wasted on Friday night he could hardly stand, it was kinda amuzing, but I felt bad for him, so I tried to take care of him, but he didn't cooperate very well..lol he just wanted to drink more...finally we got him to calm down, and then he slept in my room with Me, on my futon....

Saturday~ kinda a boring day, CHris and I slept til like 2....then I just kinda chilled and picked up the room a bit, and just chilled...Then saturday night...ooo hehe that was great :) I loved every minute of it! Great!!! Went to dinner with Mel and Taylor, we went to Stoners (a pizza place over in the Scotts), Then headed up to the 5th floor to drink with the boys and 2 new girls that I met. We had a lot of fun, at 1st things were slow and we just chilled up there...then after we started to drink, it got better...Mel went out with a friend of hers and I hung out with the guys and Meghan and Angie. We went to a house party but it kinda sucked, there were soooooo many people there and the beer was almost tapped when we got there so we left. We went back up to the 5th Floor and hung out some more, Chris got off work at like 11:15 and started to drink, but by that time I was totally tanked...lol IT was great...but yeah, just hung out for a while, then at like 2 we ordered a Pizza from Papa Johns and we stuck around to eat taht and then Mel and I finally got back to our room at like...umm 3:30...Late night but it was great :) 

Sunday~ my parents came up for a few hours, they took me and Jenny to Applebees, it was delicious! Something other then college food was good! :) Then I just hung out for a while til Mel got back from work, and then we ewnt to studied and did our laundry..so all my clothes are clean :) yay!! That was my day...pretty boring I know!

Today~ umm I dunno, classes were fine, and I did my math homework in Chris's room now he's in class from 4:10-5:10. Then after that I dunno we might go to dinner, but I dunno...I had asked Brandon earlier to go to dinner, but he never got back to me..so I'm not too sure whats goin on..I'm waitin! Then tonight...its a lay low night..Packer Game and such :)"

"event","At first things were rocky, I wasn't all that happy and Brandon was being gay...but NOW..

My Roommate is amazing, I love her to death! She's from Oshkosh so its all good cuz she can introduce me to people and everything. I'm so happy here now. I've met a lot of people thru Mel...and things are goin well :) I've been hangin out A LOT with Mel's friend from high school...his name is Chris, he's a freshman too..Pre Pharmacy...ooo SMART boy :) The guys on his floor are the coolest guys ever! Theres Andrew, Bobby, Paul, Paul, Ryan, Chris, Beau, Joe and others. I've been hangin out over in South Scott a lot lately. The 5th Floor is great! I love it there. I've been off campus a lot lately too, Chris has a car so we go out at night and just hang out. Yesterday I went to his friend Travis's house and we drank a lil bit, and had a good time, then we came back to the dorms and ordered pizza..that Mel and I didn't get to eat. :( O well..I'm goin to lunch with Chris today...He's so cool, we get along so well...it reminds me of hangin out with Tony and the guys...The car talk and everything, I fit in with Chris and his friends REALLY well cuz I talk bout cars with them, and stuff like that...

I played need for speed underground on X-Box the other day in Chris's room, he let me PIMP out the Eclipse...I was so happy :) He said he'll keep it cuz its fuckin awesome! AHH I LOVE IT HERE! At first I wasn't too fond of being up here...but things are SOO  much better now, I've met people in my classes too, they're goin great by the way...I'm just really happy now...

Tonight~~ I guess I'm goin out with Chris and Andrew to hang out in Oshkosh somewhere, then I gotta call Jill and let her know what we're up to, so maybe she'll come hang out with us :) I guess the scotts are pretty cool to live in, the rooms suck but the people on the floors are awesome, and everyone has so much fun..unlike my dorm...I think I've spent more time the last few days in the Scott's not my own room..lol :) mel and i love to hang out with the boys, we all get along so well! lol

I'll write more later, after tonight is done..when I know how fucked I got and then I can talk bout the Oshkosh Parties :) YAY!!!! Have a good day!"

"event","<P>So...it's DEFFINATLY time to get outa here, I need to start over new, I need to get things off my mind, I need to meet new people like all my other friends have done so far. Life SUCKS around here the last few days, and I'm just ready to leave and get on with the next part of my life.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I know I'm gunna miss my mom and dad, but I really need to get out on my own, and learn how to live without them by my side all the time. Brandon thinks I'm too spoiled..well we'll see how long that lasts!! Without mom and dad by my side I'm really NOT gunna be spoiled anymore. Maybe I'll grow up enough to be able to have&nbsp;a ""college"" relationship rather then a ""high school"" one...or so Brandon puts it. </P>
<P>I admit I'm not the most mature person on the planet...and I'm not gunna deny that at all....but I know that the SECOND my parents leave, things will change, and I'm going to be a different person, and it sucks to know that Brandon didnt stick around long enough to see anything happen to me....I guess he'll stick around to be friends, but I dont know how well that will work out..cuz I care bout him so much and its not the easiest thing to just become friends with someone you care about...I love him...i HONESTLY think that I do...and I told him that..but he doesnt feel the same..so ONCE again..I'm always the one to get hurt, and it SUCKS bad! So theres&nbsp;a part of me that wishes I wasn't going to the same school as Brandon so it would be easier to forget..but then theres a part of me thats SO HAPPY that I am...he says he wants to be there for me, and be there for whatever I need. He said..if I'm in a situation I dont want to be in...that I should call him and he'll bail me out, or if somethings wrong..he wants to be the one I call. SO we'll see how well that goes..I dunno...<EM><STRONG>I HAT E LIFE..I REALLY DO!!! </STRONG></EM>I need to get outa here!</P>"

I'm going to miss you so much, but I'm glad we have our scrapbook and phones to call eachother whenever we get homesick and miss our friends.

I would like to make sure u STUDY tho..cuz u need to get those grades up!!! and Also I still want things to be the same with our friendship but ya know get rid of the physical stuff, its ok to do, it'll be fine!&nbsp;I luv ya, and I hope that things work out with us, but like I said..if they don't then we'll be great friends either way!</P>
<P>So I'm ready to get the hell outa here, I dont leave for another week, but I'm really ready to leave now! I've already been invited to a party at the Football House in Oshkosh, so thats gunna be awesome! A girl that went to my high school is a sophomore up there and she invited me to her birthday bash that her friends are throwing her! So I can't wait for that, and it'll be a good way to meet people!! Countin down the days..ONLY 8 LEFT!!!</P>"

"event","<P>So I havn't written in a while, the last time I wrote I was all about my birthday and how excited I was for that. Well everything went well and my Tattoo is completely healed and lookin good :) But on to why I'm writing tonight...</P>
<P><BR>This summer has been very good so far, I'm happy with all the things I've done and everyone I've seen. My summer has been so great thanks to all my old friends who I've begun to talk to again, the new friends I've met and hung out with, and also the ""new friend"" who recently walked back into my life. And we can't forget Brandon, he's my newest friend and fellow Oshkosh student (a sophomore), so now I'll have someone to show me around up at school and someone to make sure I stay on track cuz he knows what its like to be a Freshman...Although things have been so good lately, I still miss the GROUP...</P>
<P><BR>The one thing I know I miss more then anything is all the fun times I had last summer. I miss the group so much and I really can't wait til Saturday for Erin and Maren's party to see everyone again...minus Jimmy cuz he's gotta work. For any of you who read this...I miss you guys and before the summer ends we better all hang out one night at Heather's or the bowling alley or something just like we did last summer. There are so many memories that can't be forgotten and I'll never forget the friends I had last summer and the ones I miss so much right now. You guys were the best....and I hope we can all see eachother soon! </P>
<P><BR>In recent news....I had my wisdom teeth out on July 6, that was not cool at all...I was good all day Tuesday and everything I mean I was loopy as my mom would say for a few hours...well most of the day. But I had so many people stop over to see me and that really made my day and made me feel so good. Thank you to everyone who came over and sat with me for a bit...especially Heather, Aly and Jon..it was good to see you guys and thanks for caring enough to stop by, even if it wasn't for long...u heard the Chubby....b...bu...buh....Rabbit story...that was funny hehehe :) and mostly thank you to Melissa...the one who spent the WHOLE day with me...from 2pm til at least midnight. But thanks everyone for caring, I love you guys :)</P>
<P><BR>In the next week..things are gunna be so hectic...wow I don't know how i'm gunna have any time to work. Monday I'm babysitting and going to a movie with Brandon, Tuesday is&nbsp; <FONT color=#000099 size=4><STRONG>WARPED TOUR</STRONG></FONT> and thats what I've been waitin for the WHOLE summer!! I can't wait, and Wednesday, Brandon's having his party, and then Friday...<STRONG>SIMPLE PLAN</STRONG> at Waukesha County Fair...amazing! I can't wait for that either!

"event","So I havn't really updated in a while..things have been so up and down lately. This week although has been pretty wonderful. The whole Tony situation is way outa hand, we both have a lot of growing up to do, me for the most part, but he needs to realize that ignoring the situation isn't going to either change it OR make it any better. We'll never get thru anything if he can't sit down and talk about it. So thats just old news now, this week...

Monday I worked so I didn't really do anything, Tuesday I went to look at tattoo designs with my mom, Greg, and Melissa! and after the tattoo place, I came home and sat around for like an hour when Ryan called..and asked me if I wanted to go with Ice Cream with Melissa, Mitch and Him...so I got to see Melissa TWICE in one day! It was awesome!! Wednesday..Worked...did NOTHING special...

Thursday was a good day, went to track then met up with Britt, Heather, Jon, Aly, Peter, Leslie and of course Mrs. Motisi at American Tattoo so I could watch Heather get her tattoo...I'm kinda nervous about mine, but I'm sooo excited too, heather handled it real well, so I'm not as nervous as I was b4. Then Jon, Aly, Heather and I went to Mamma Mia's and got some pizza...YUMMY it was good :) Then I got my nails done...then after that I met up with Ryan, Mitch, Lando and 2 other guys I don't know at McDonalds...that was interresting...it's not a good idea to throw your cell phone across the restuarant....

Then Tonight..I'm not too sure whats goin on yet...I'm supposed to go to dinner then Ryan is having people at his house so I might stop over there with Melissa, but I gotta get ahold of her 1st....or I'm gunna go out with Heather and I dunno who else...I'll figure it all out when the time comes...gimme a call...

so to wrap it up..I'm pretty happy this week...it's been a good week...and the BEST part of it is gunna be PROM!!! TOMORROW NIGHT! yay! I just hope it doesn't rain for pictures..that would sucK!!"

"event","The best thing and the worst thing happened all in one day...I broke the schools indoor Triple Jump record on Saturday morning, and Tony and I got into a fight about ""Us"". So that sucked.

Monday~ Went to the mall with Britt...then came home and went to see Starsky and Hutch with Mitch. That was fun to get out and see a friend I havn't seen in like 10 months! I used to talk to him everday and then it just stopped..so it was good a see one of my good friends again!

Tuesday~ O yesterday was so fun!!! Well the morning wasnt...Tony and I hung out for a bit...and basically said GOOD BYE. I dunno when I'll talk to him and I don't know when I'll see him. He agreed that if we hung out with the group that he would deal with the fact that both of us might be there. So that would be ok..but ALONE I dunno when I'll see him alone...so I cried for like 2 hours straight..then went to Track..ran 10, 200's~~ those were such a bitch! lol but i felt like I burned off all the candy I ate on easter! Then after that britt and I went to Swingtime and met up with Angie, Dana, Pilon, Doherty, Josh, and John. That was fun, I learned how to drive a ball!! I've never ONCE held a golf club that wasn't a mini golf club! so Pilon and Doherty tried to teach me..and after a while I kinda caught on..I hit the ball prolly like 75 yards or so..nothing more then that..But it was fuN~ Then dana and I wanted to go in the batting cages...but when I went in the medium hardball one..it broke on me...and I didnt even get a free token..that was gay! After swingtime we went to Rut's house, his dog is the cutest thing I've ever seen...and Ryan's really good at the guitar! So that was fun too..then I had to go get my nails done..and that was the end of my day! 

So yeah last night was fun, and today I'm goin to Mayfair with my mom and Brittney, then Track practice at 3, then work til 9:30....ehh boring day!!"

He thought I was mad about something and i wasn't and then we started this rediculous fight...well its all settled now..I spent the day with him today..and things are ok with US..but he hasn't talked to his dad or told his dad that he's even speaking to me right now..so he's afraid his dad is gunna give him shit..but other then that...</P>
<P>I was thinkin today..and yesterday...Yesterday was the start of 4th quarter..and I mentioned the whole senioritis thing settin in...but today..the thought of goin to college set in...I'm actually kinda scared and nervous for that to happen...these last 4 years have gone by SOOOO fast that its just hard to believe that high school is almost over...2 Months and 13 days until graduation...thats just INSANE!!! I can't believe it...</P>
<P>This last quarter is gunna be kinda hard...I'm workin now to break a school track&nbsp;record for Triple Jump indoors..I have 2 weeks to beat it...but at the meet we're goin to this weekend they're not having triple jump..so I have one week to do it...But one thing I'll miss most about high school is track...I'm gunna cry so hard to the banquet...I can see it comin now..my coach says something about each girl on the team...and when he gets to me..he'll say something like ""we never thought ashley would be a long jumper until this year...blah blah blah.."" and I'll just have tears in my eyes...and Reality has hit...HIGH SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER...thats kinda sad???......</P>
<P>ok now that I've gotten out what I've been thinkin about ALL day...I'm gunna go watch some TV...later!</P>"

"event","<P>my 18th birthday~ i know its not til May..but I think I wanna get a tattoo!! I've always kinda wanted one..like a lil rose or gymnast or something. But I was always afraid I'd be too much of a chicken to go thru with it cuz I had needles and I dont think I have a high tolerence to pain....although my mom thinks I do..but anyways...I've been lookin for the last few days at what things I'd like..I've found like 2 or 3 really cute ones that I liked! I know they're kinda plain and everyone gets roses, but I LOVE ROSES and you can change the colors when they tattoo you...so I'd make my roses blue not red :) hehe they're cute to go across my lower back!</P>

"event","Today was kinda boring and SLOW until Physics!! Physics was so great today...this one girl in my class I think her name is Liz...the girls that sit behind me call her ""the mom"" cuz she dresses like one and acts like one...we always laugh at Liz and stuff cuz she has a crush on Mr. Vick (my teacher) but today was extra funny cuz we realized she wasnt laughing at Mr. Vick's stupid jokes..she was sleeping! So our class being the mean people that we are...just watched her and kinda laughed that she was sleeping..in the FRONT row of the room. Then someone I dunno who...but someone threw a paper airplane almost hit me in the side of the face and TOTALLY missed Liz...then she looked like she was gunna fall outa her chair so we started to laugh and thats when Mr. Vick realized what we were laughing at...then she woke up to the whole class laughing at her..It was really funny cuz she had NO idea and then she just went back to sleep again. I know its mean..but it was really funny tho! I guess you had to be there! :)"

He said ""you can tell chris he was right, this did last about a week"" and i tried to hard to be like well what lasted a week? but he knew i couldnt do that..so we're ok now, and things are goin great as of now, no fighting or arguing or anything! we're good to go for now :) hehe</P>
<P>Friday~ was a great night, granted i was so worn out and acted like a lazy ass a bowling, but dinner at PF Changs was wonderful as usual, I LOVE IT! Jimmy got a bag of fortune cookies and he was greedy, i had to steal some from him ..but he got mad at me for that...sorry Jimmy! :) Then we went bowling at Lake View Lanes in Pewaukee, it was fun..but I was so beat from the week of track so I kinda seemed a lil lazy until I woke up a bit. It was great to see everyone together again, and it just seems like its summer again :) I love that feeling...and I just want the summer to come once again! </P>
<P>Saturday~ i had track bright and early in the morning...then went out during the day with Tony, he got a new cell phone...well same phone as b4 but its not broken like the other one. So they just swapped out his old phone cuz the chick said that microphone was gunna die...so he didnt care he got a new phone..now it works! :) yay! Then I worked til 9:30, and Tony got pulled over kinda in the dairy queen parking lot..some cop drove by saw his parking lights on and thought he was gunna either rob the place or dealin drugs, or gunna jump all of us when we left..it was weird, but she called his license in and stuff and it came back as suspended and she told me I had to drive his car home that he wasnt aloud to...so then we went thru all the trouble to get one of my cars to his house...it was a long evening, and then finally we made it back to his house and watched the 1st half of the Lord Of the Rings~ Two Towers extended version..til I fell asleep at like 1 am...then went home at like 2...long night!</P>
<P>Sunday~ went to work til 4, then went to tonys to watch him and his brother play video games..but i slept for like 2 hours so it was ok..then at like 7:30 we went to my house to watch the 2nd half of the Lord of The Rings~ Two Towers extended version, then went in my hottub too...it was a somewhat relaxing day..not really but kinda.</P>
<P>This week shouldnt be too bad, Track meet on Friday at South and one on Saturday morning as well out in Whitewater. Should be home in the early afternoon...and I dont have to work..so Saturday should be a NICE DAY!! :) yay! NO WORK! As for the nights during the week...

So last night was good for the most part...we talked and he told me some things that I've become to believe were true..that they really are true..they kinda hurt me a bit..but he really does seem like he cares..so that makes me smile! </P>
<P>Yesterday was my 1st day at track practice...i found out my triple jump coach wants me to High Jump this year as well as triple jump and possibly long jump. I guess I'll be running at practice but not in meets...which is TOTALLY fine with me...running in meets makes me nervous..i dunno why but it does...so Today at practice we're doin long and triple jump steps and stayin inside again!

"event","<P>So today I went to Tony's, we faught at 1st but then we got to talking about things. We talked about some good times and some bad and just realized some things...well at least I did! I <STRONG>really</STRONG> do love him more then anything, and I don't want to lose him...and I think that we'll be ok to be friends for now, and then we'll have to see what happens and if we start dating again then I'll be happy and if we dont, then I'll still have him as my friend. This past week I've realized the stupid things that I need to give up, and that if he doesn't wanna do something I can't make a big deal outa it..and hopefully I can prove that to him that I'm gunna stop the stupid shit! So I left his house today on good terms, he hugged me and said he'd call me later tonight and let me know what ITT Tech said..cuz he's meeting with a Financial Aid Officer tonight...so we'll see how that goes.</P>
<P>The past few days I've been writing Tony a little booklet of a bunch of good memories that we've had...ONE~ to make him think a little bit more, so he doesnt think our relationship was all bad, and TWO~ just because I wanted him to know how much I care about him, and that I remember so many things and so many good times we've shared. It was 15 pages! And if we start dating again...maybe I'd make some more for our 1 year anniversary...but that is if we start dating again!! We'll see. But some of the things I wrote about made me even cry..and I'm hoping he reads them all. He said he'd read some tonight when he gets home from ITT....so I wonder if he'll have anything to say to me about it....So I'm a lot happier today then I have been in the last few days..and this past week...</P>
<P>I think there is some hope still there for us..but its a 50/50 chance right now...it could really go either way...he might take me back..and he might not...so we'll just have to wait and see...BUT we're friends for now..and he said so, so thats a good thing. So we'll see where that takes us from now on :)</P>"

"event","this week has been the WORST week of my life...I don't even know how to handle it..

I can't eat, I can't sleep..I can't get Tony outa my mind...as much as I can't call him, or contact him...I want to sooooooo bad...I just don't know what its like without him in my life anymore...its been so long that he's been here, and so long that he loved me..and ALL OF A SUDDEN he doesn't love me anymore, and can't tell me he does, and he's so mean to me now...and I don't know what to do about it...it's so hard to handle. I admit yeah I knew it was prolly coming, but I didn't expect it to be like this. This is just terrible. He won't even give me the time of day to explain shit to me....I'm so clueless about it too, and he doesn't care to tell me reasons why he's leaving, and how can he fall outa love with me overnight, is that possible??? I guess I just dont get it, he told me that I can't face the reality that he's breaking up with me...and he's right, I can't face that fact...because of how much he loved me b4 and all of a sudden he doenst love me..he hates me..I dont know what to do, its so hard to just let him go...and if I let him go...all I can hope for is that he'll come back and I guarantee that I'll be here for a while waitin for him to come back...cuz its gunna take a long time to get over him! I don't think I'll be movin on ANYTIME soon...

All I can end with is...

I LOVE YOU TONY, and I'll miss you more then anything. You're my world. All I think about is you, you're everything to me whether u think that or not, YOU ARE. Everywhere I turn theres a memory of you, We've been through so much and now its just all gone. I know you dont miss me...but hopefully someday you will and when you do, I'll be here for you still...I LOVE YOU"

Tonight I think Tony and I are goin to dinner...not sure if we are doin that or not, then we're goin to Jefferson to visit an old friend of his...that is if the weather is ok by then...and if tony wants to drive out there...so that will also be a last minute plan...o well. At least I'll see him tonight :) I've missed him the last few days...its been strange...

Yesterday at my gymnastics meet...I didnt do too bad...I stuck my beam routine, landed one of my vaults...ehh not too exciting, but my floor routine..I did a good routine I really liked the floor the other school had, it was really nice, and I think it was my best score this season on floor...I'm not too sure tho...o well...but I did good :)

Practice is gunna be short today...not doin much...I dont have much to do except for vault..so maybe I'll get out really early...i can wish..:)"

I doubt it..lol but I did succeed in some way...britt was tryin front handsprings and I told her she had it..and that she just didnt know it, and she ended up doing it she landed kinda on her knees but at least she knows she can do it now..so that was cool...then there was lunch when we got free shit from cousins...that was nice :) I think we'l be goin there more often now after they have their new low carb wraps cuz I think they were good :) Oh yeah in PHYSICS today...Claire the junior girl that sits by me...I was listenin to my Yahoo Radio station on the computer, and its generated to be all punk becuz I made it that way...and she said ""i didnt think you'd be into that"" I dunno why she didnt give an answer when I asked...but I dunno I thought it was funny...kinda...shes funny tho, I've got so many great memories from physics...that class is great :) haha</P>

I dont wanna cut us down..but everyone knows theres no way in hell we'll beat racine. So yeah...yesteday Katie saw the trainer and he told her she'd be out for a bit..and she needed to go to the doctor...she came back to practice sayin he told her she had a torn MCL...which is not what he said cuz I talked to him in one of my many visits to the training room...with my stupid ankles. SO Katie's out for a while, Michelle's back is still hurting, and my ankles are gettin better..Meet Tomorrow night and I dunno how that will go..We'll see..but now I have to get back to school so I can finsh my day :)"

"event","<P>So today started out <STRONG>great</STRONG>....until Gymnastics. I was so excited to go practice today..tomorrows another Varsity Invite...that I can't compete in now...Heres why...</P>
<P><FONT size=4><EM>Ok so I knew I had to do the 3 events we set up...and that I'd need to do at least 2 routines on each one...Vault, Beam and Bars. so Nikki and I decided to do bars 1st to get it overwith. That was a bad idea!!! I warmed up and everything, and I started to do my actual skills. I did a straddle back (release from the high bar and straddle over the low bar) and I missed my right hand, so of course I fell to the right side cuz I didn't have any support to hold me up. I popped the tape on my ankle open, and it prolly saved my ankle a lot. I fell to the floor, and it felt exactly like it felt last year when I fell. I started to hyper ventilate, and Nikki and my coach were there tryin to calm me down, so I started to calm down when the trainer got there, and he took me to the training room and looked at my ankle. But the 1st thing he asked was ""did you have surgery last year when you did this?"" and No i didnt have surgery..so I'm thinkin that I might have to have surgery this time...and that would not be good at all...I'm not a very happy camper now...</EM></FONT></P>
<P>What else sucks is...I was supposed to go TUBING with the gang tonight, and now I can't go cuz I can hardly walk. I'm so pissed I was lookin forward to doing that becuz I havnt gone sledding/tubing in prolly 2 years. So thats not cool...I guess I'm just chillin at home til Jimmy and Heather call me when they're done..and people come over here...Maybe Tony will take me out to dinner...? SO thats up til now with my shitty day...maybe tonight will end up being fun or something...</P>"

"event","this week has been so long and tiring I'm ready to roll over and sleep til sunday. I'm so incredibly tired and I cant seem to get enough sleep, last night I got home from work and I went to bed at 9:45 but I'm still tired...and i feel outa shape for gymnastics, we only had 3 practices over break and i feel like i lost so much and i feel like i SUCK!!! its depressing...

so today at gymnastics we were talkin about how a girl I used to go to salto is bulimic, i coudln't believe that she would ever do that, but then it made me think that I'd really lose weight if I did do that...but as much as I'd wanna try it and as much as I DO wanna lose weight I couldn't bring myself to throw up my food EVER! It was quite an interresting conversation, but what drove me away even more is this girl pukes so much that she starts throwing up blood...how could someone do that to themselves? I've honestly thought about it b4, but then I think about how much i HATE throwing up when I'm sick and I wouldn't wanna do that everyday, and all the knowledge I have of the disease just make me sick, I don't know why people would do that and I just dont understand why this particular girl could do that, she doesnt need an eating disorder to keep herself thin, she already is!

HONESTLY~ would you ever want to throw up all the food you eat and make yourself sick, just so you could look skinny?"

School started again today..I really wish I was in college right about now cuz I'd like to be home sleeping for alone 2-3 weeks...it would be so nice and relaxing...but I'm not in college yet but soon enough it'll come.

I dont wanna think about college, I've had to fill out some stuff lately to send into Oshkosh, but I'm procrastinating on it cuz I don't wanna think about it right now. College is gunna tear me apart...at least I think so. I love TOny with all my heart and I dont wanan think that I wont be able to see him everyday like I do now, its kinda scary knowin that I'll be an hour away and he might still be here...but my uncle is tryin to talk him into goin to Madison Media Institute or ITT Tech, so if he goes to madison I dunno if he'll be closer or not, he might even be further away if he goes there..but I dunno its too hard to think about now....I'm just gunna go spend the rest of the night with him on the couch and then go to sleep...GOOD NIGHT]

i woke up this morning to go to gymnastics at 8:30, I was SOO gunna be on TIME today, but then my tire on my car blew, so i was like ok well what am i supposed to do I dont have a spare in my car, so my dad came and picked me up, took me to practice then him and my brother went to take my car to the tire place. so I got outa practice and had to wait all afternoon for my car. It was good in a way cuz I got to take a nap and sleep it was nice, but o well..then i had to go to work and it wasnt too bad tonight..we had fun Kim, Kasey and I :)

I was so pissed i wrote back ""nobody tells Ashley she's a fuckin mistake!!"" So I went to the party VERY VERY angry... I dont really care that it was HIM who said it..I'm just mad that some has to nerve to come out and say You were a mistake...I cant' believe taht someone would have the balls to say that...Then later on he told me he regretted knowing me...so that was harsh too...

WEnt to the Gymnastics X-Mas party at Tanya's house (my coach). IT was a lot of fun, Anna had me for secret santa, she got me the Starting Line CD ( the acoustic EP) Its a great CD :), I had Carly and I got her the cutest comfy pants and I wanted them for myself and Tony told me I cant buy things b4 christmas cuz I never know if I'll get it from someone else..so I didnt get them for me.

"event","So last night at gymnastics I was gettin ready for the meet we have on tuesday so i did my actual competition vault, and i landed really hard on my left ankle (which is my good one) so now I have 2 bad ankles, and I'm out for up to a week...my ankles are so fuckin stupid, and its beginning to annoy me cuz I hurt them so often... The doctor told me this morning that I should be out for a week but its up to me cuz i know the whole drill and I know when I'm feeling better, so we'll see, I might STILL compete on Tuesday Night against Arrowhead but We'll see. 

On a better note, last night I got my hair cut and re-highlighted :) Its soooo cute I LOVE IT!! i put the same color red in it as I had b4, and i have the golden brown hightlights and my brown hair color :) Its sooo cute :) hehe Hopefully I'll see the group tonight cuz I havnt seen  everyone since the DRAMA night at my house :(

"event","the last few days have been kinda weird...
2 Days ago...my car got hit in the parking lot at cousins, and that was just crazy that deaf lady...ya...

yesterday~ At gymnastics Laura hurt her knee again, now I'm afraid she'll be out all season, hopefully she'll be able to compete in a knee brace and at least do bars cuz we need her for that. I really didn't want to do all around this year I wanted to stick to Beam, Floor and Vault only..but now with Laura hurt I might have to come up with some bullshit bar routine cuz they might need me. WIth laura gone there are only 3 returning Varsity girls, Anna, Nikki and Cassie. And this year Michelle and I were added to that list, so I dunno we're havin a talk tonight at practice about how everyone needs to take a step up on the team becaus eits going to be hard with laura, and even harder without her. So everyone needs to take a step up! :) So that scared me alil and I hope Laura is doin ok!!!

Today...Nothing interresting yet...maybe something cool will happen today...Gymnastics 3-6 and Work 7-9 have a nice night everyone :)

Heather and Jimmy~ I love you both and I hope things are ok, I hope you both feel a lil better...I'm here for both of you !"

"event","Ok so today was pretty good until lunch..well besides 3rd hour when I told britt about a pic i saw...which i didnt mean to make her all paranoid...i just thought I'd tell her what I saw..I'm SORRY Britt!! I shouldnt have told you, but you're prolly glad I did, DONT be paranoid!! I'm sorry!!!

Then on to lunch...well Britt, Jeff and i were at cousins eattin our subs mindin our own business..and some lady was tryin to back her huge Chevy Tahoe Z21 into the spot next to my car...and of course she missed and happened to hit my car, I didnt think anything was really gunna be wrong with it..plus I HATE my car and I wish the lady would have fucked it up more..but thats besides the point! The lady drove off..and some guy told me he got her plates and that I should call the cops. I called my parents 1st my dad wasnt home...so I called my mom at work, and she said stay there and call the cops so I did, b ut right as the cop was pulling into the parking lot the lady comes back...ok so that kinda takes away the hit and run cuz seh came back..but she left so I'm fileing it at hit and run cuz I wanna and I can! hehe :) So i go outside to try to talk to the lady and she starts like talkin giberish, and took my arm as if she was walkin me down the isle at my wedding, and I was just like omg this is crazy shes scareing me...so the lady was DEAF! she couldnt talk and I was like this is gunna be a long time! So britt Jeff and I sat in my car waiting for the cop to give me the info he needed to so I can file a report and get money to paint my car...

Luckily that big white mark alond the side of my car covers the FUCK YOU BITCH written by Whitney...so That will be painted over anyways with the insurance money that we'll get to paint my car...so that was my interesting day..now its time for Gymnastics 3-6 then home to wait for Tony to get off work then watch Lord Of the Rings! NO HOMEWORK TONIGHT!! YAY!!!"

"event","Good Afternoon...I'm kinda bored and tired, sittin in physics class. Sorry I havn't writen in a while, I've been busy busy busy the last week or so. High School gymnastics started last Monday (the 10th) its been good so far, I like it. Its got its pluses and minues. PLus~ I do what I want not what my coaches want me to do, I do what I'm comfortable with, and I get to compete waht I want to compete. Minus~ ITS NOT SALTO!!! I'm dealin tho. Its ok.  

SO I'm on this diet now, no fast food and no soda and IF I drink a soda its gotta be diet with like NOTHING in it!! I've lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks...which i guess it pretty goood so I'm doin good with that. Doin like 600-800 situps a day to try to trim my tummy down cuz I'm a chunker...and I'm feelin pretty good. For the 1st few days I would get a lil sick from no soda and caffine but I'm good now I dont even crave soda and I see it and dont want it.so its goin really well! :) GYmnastics is helping a lot too..runnin and such...

SO tonight I was supposed to go to Sugarcult with Heather and some others but my mom is stupid and said ""I dont care if you go to concerts on weekends but on a school night I dont think its a good idea"" how gay is that? O well I guess i have to deal with it cuz she wont let me go anyways cuz I got a major attitude with her when she said I couldn't go. I'M SORRY HEATHER!!!! 
Now I gota get back to class...I have a test tomorrow so I gotta learn a lil today so I can study tonight..hahaha

~*Ash*~

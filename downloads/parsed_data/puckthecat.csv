"event","first friday back at school, so naturally we had a little shindig - me, maggie, laura, amanda, chris, garth, maggie d., and julio.  we played ""time's up,"" which is like taboo but with people and, uh, different rules.  but there's guessing.  i was on a team with maggie, and i'm happy to say we rocked it hard.  the other teams had a bit of a harder time, but to be fair, it was their first time.  and, despite the fact we were drinking, we actually played all three rounds!  almost.  at some point it turned into a dance party and then we went to spa to get food.  which is how those nights normally end up.  i also have a hickey that looks like a jellyfish and is the color of an eggplant.  it was a three person job though - maggie d., amanda, and garth.  

favorite moment - laura saying ""fuckin' white cracker music"" in reference to bruce springsteen.  she had a lot of red wine, y'all.

the evening ended on a bit of a low note, despite the presence of a beatles cover band at the spa.  i was drunk and gross feeling.  and i'm pretty sure i need to apologize to someone.

then i went to the swim/dive meet today with chris and garth, which is my first skidmore athletic thing i've attended.  it was pretty fun, lots of hot guys in very little clothing.  also, diving is great to watch, even though i was freaking out a bit over how high the board was - i do not like heights, even when other people are the ones at them.  

now i'm eating popcorn and being lazy, though i might break out some reading for class.  oh, and take a nap.  that would be excellent."

my copy of ""harry potter and the sorcerer's stone"" is signed by j.k. rowling!

i got it like, when it first came out.  it was recommended to my mom by her friend who was...i don't know, a publisher maybe.  but anyway, i guess she had gotten it signed as a special treat (this was way before the book became huge, so it wasn't as much of a big deal).  and i didn't even notice until today.

ME.

i...i love this laptop.  it is my baby, and i shall protect it like a mother bear protects her cubs.  don't mess.  i think i'll name it something.  my brother's vaio is named ""indie rock pete.""  suggestions for me?

anyway, i was on the porch before and i was online!  on the porch!  the magic of wireless internet.  well, technically i had the power cord plugged in.  but it was wireless in spirit.  and also, when my dad shut the porch door, the wireless signal died.  but for a good ten seconds there, i was feeling totally awesome.

it's a graduation present from my parents (the best in the world).  so yeah, i graduated last week - saturday to be exact.  it was a pretty nice ceremony - it could have rained, but it didn't, and it could have been incredibly and painfully hot, but it wasn't.  so i was very pleased.  but the speeches went on FOREVER - there was a speech made by the principal, the super intendant, the salutatorian, the valedictorian, the president of the ptsa, and the president of the senior class.  and they were not great.  the ptsa president talked about how her mother died last year and the super intendant talked about how we should learn to enjoy ordinary things.  like, thanks for the uplifting message as i leave to start a new phase of my life.

there have been a lot of parties since then.  i am very tired.

graduation party tomorrow - we're expecting about 100 people - mostly family.  it'll be the biggest party we've had in a while."

"event","this is what i thought about today while wasting time - 

for the first two weeks of my internship, no one except my boss knew my name.  so i would get a lot of things addressed to ""intern"" or sometimes ""new intern"" if the writer wanted to get more personal.  once, while i was scanning every news article that ever mentioned the company since the advent of written language, a coworker said, ""um...intern, do you know how to make this copy?""

a message taped on my desk says ""attention to current intern - please remember to remove all personal items at the end of use.""  i felt like someone who only gets mail adressed to ""current resident.""  i wondered if if anyone like that actually existed, though.   i decided that they've probably already been eaten by their cats.

eta - that was meant in a sarcastic humor kind of way, not depressing.  but thank you for your concern, becca."

"event","i have an internship now - instead of superfluous classes after AP tests, my school makes us get an internship wherever we can find one.  i'm working at ""in the life media,"" which is a production company that produces ""in the life,"" a show on pbs (big stretch there).  it's very gay.  dillon called it ""in the gay life.""  anyway, i've been there for almost three weeks now - i work monday to friday, from 11-4.  and also, i love the fact it's in the city.  i've already become so much better at navigation and crossing the road (shut up), plus there are coffee places EVERYWHERE.  

i mostly do menial tasks as a high school intern, but i like it - the office is very friendly.  of course, i used feel like the intern troll.  my cubical is behind two others, and back when they weren't sure of my skill level, i would only come out every now and then to ask my boss a question (i was doing really simple data entry).  just sitting in my little cave, slowly going blind and eating smashed up raw fish.  but then when my boss realized that i was finishing the simple things quickly, she moved me onto more interesting things.  well, ok, there was one incident that involved me mopping the whole office, but i'm just going to gloss over that little event.  anyway, now most people know who i am.  except for the guy i was working with today who was bizarrely micro-managing.  he had me file some documents, and gave me a speech about how he thought is was better if i placed them in two piles first based on the name at the top, one a-m and the other n-z.  then i could sort them into the cabinets, and put all the ones without a place to go into a separate folder.  then sort them into two piles.  then give them back to him in two piles.  so i just sorted everything the sensible way and saved about 30 minutes of work.  then he put me on another project, and explained to me how to label envelopes.  and how, despite what i may have learned in high school, only ONE address goes on an envelope.  then, he asked if i knew how to type.

maybe he thought i was an autistic person with high functioning verbal skills.

but i won't have to work with him again, thank god.

we also had our final peer leadership party tonight (which i forgot about until an hour after it began) at adan's house.  there was a pool, but when i got there swimming time was pretty much over.  dear lord, some of the boys in the group are hot.  muscles like you wouldn't believe.  i wasn't sure whether i should get like, a body image complex or jump on them.  i decided on neither.  we ate, played video games and pool, normal stuff.  it was fun - i'll miss it.  we were a great group.

then saw ariana perform at the high school cabaret.  she sang ""girl from impanema"" and was excellent.  not only did she sing well (as she does), but she actually chose a song that fit her voice.  the other acts were...rougher.  there was the normal flat notes and false starts, but the worst was some sort of frightening piece of performance art/freestyle rap which wouldn't have seemed out of place in 1986.  seriously - there was a Korg synthesizer.  it was so bad, i almost had to give myself temporary amnesia.

work tomorrow, then the weekend - filled with rehearsals for ""a chorus line.""  wish me stamina."

"event","i just finished decorating our kitchen so that it will look like paris for mother's day.  what that means is a lot of read, white, and blue (with helpful accent pieces to distinguish from the twenty or so other countries with those colors).  the centerpieces on the table (of whcih i am particularly proud) is a wire eiffel tower with red and blue fireworks exploding above it.  also, i decorated my mom's chair to look very important, in a french way, which ended up looking like napoleon if he were a piece from ikea.  while i did this, hugh set up the brunch for tomorrow - chocolate chip, blueberry, and regular pancakes with a respberry lemon sauce, mango salad, and hash browns.  he had to imrpovise a lot, considering that he came up intending to make both breakfast and dinner, but our pantry was severely lacking in supplies.  but what he's doing right now smell's amazing.

i went to the highly anticipated episcopal church thrift sale friday and today.  friday i was able to swing by during lunch, so i got there pretty early on and there was still some great clothing.  i got a green tweed jacket, a black hoodie-thing, and 4 t-shirts - one that says ""pirates,"" one for irvington day camp, one with the cat-in-the-hat, and one that says ""help me!  i am lost!  i ran away from my owner jim and he loves me very much.  i have no tail and one extra toe"" which i think might be my favorite shirt ever (total cost $4).  but apparently i am a bad judge of size, as three of the shirts are small but wearable, while i the cat one is so small i'm giving it to ana.  today most of the clothes in my size were uninteresting, but i got two cds, one of japanese folk music and the other of ""cello music for relaxation"" (total cost $2).  the folk music one is pretty nice, i played it while attempting to nap this afternoon.  i haven't listened to the cello one yet, but i have high hopes.

tomorrow the plan is to keep my mom in bed until 9:30 while we cook and clean everything up downstairs, then eat.  should be fun."

"event","i haven't written in two months, i just realized, which makes me feel very guilty.  so, in an effort to get myself back online (perhaps working myself up to a return to ps, as cabell keeps wishing for), i'm going to update.  note: major life decisions!

so this was, in the end, my college breakdown - accepted: skidmore, bard, sarah lawrence, johns hopkins; deferred: wesleyan; rejected: tufts, vassar.  which is pretty good.  i wanted to get accepted by the majority, and i was.  also, i was extremely surprised about johns hopkins, as it was a total reach.  but it was a truly excellent surprise.  in the end, i've decided to go to skidmore.  johns hopkins, despite being very awesome, just didn't have the right environment, i think.  it's very science oriented, even though they have a great writing program.  also, romit told me that the kids there are viciously competitive (to the extent of stealing notebooks and the like).  there is no way i want to enter into that, i have enough of it from the school i'm currently in.  skidmore, on the other hand, is a great size (about 2400), and i got inot the ""honors forum,"" which is for smart kids.  they offer the option of living on one of the three ""honors"" floors, but i'm going to pass on that - i just want to be mixed up with everyone.  in my school, the kids who take advance classes almost travel in a pack, and i really want to distance myself from that kind of atmosphere (see above).  oh, and saratoga springs is an amazing town.  i used to visit with my parents every summer (during the horse races), and it was always a good time.  it's upstate, but it's the summer home of the new york ballet, it has a great new arts center, and it really has a great economic boost from the racing.  plus, the town apparently has an amazing book store, according to my brother's girlfriend.  

so yeah, go skidmore class of '09.

and school's basically over.  well, all over but the ap testing (sob).  i am not 11.5 hours away from my first - english language and composition.  which will be fine, so i'm not studying.  then i have human geography, which i don't care about.  the class has been a joke all year, which is almost sad because it really could have been engaging.  but tuesday i have calculus - maybe my most dreaded test.  i'm not even going to venture a guess on how i'll do there.  then, the week after, i have latin and econ.  those are iffy, because very few people do well on them, so there aren't high standards, but i want to do well on latin, at least.  

after the tests, i am done with high school classes.  that's crazy; i almost can't believe it.  i have an internship for the last three weeks until graduation.  it's the administrations attempt to prevent the normla end of the year activities of seniors, such as skip day, sleep out, and prank week (they're mostly succesful).  a lot of the pranks in the past have involved farm animals, so the principal felt he needed to do something before it progressed to beats of the veldt or something similar.  i'm going to be working at ""in the life,"" a documentary show on pbs about issues facing gay youth.  i'm excited.

so that's stuff.  let's hope for regularity now."

"event","i got into sarah lawrence!  awesome!  it's the first school i've heard back from (not counting the deferral from vassar) so far, and i got in.  i'm taking this as a good sign - the dean of admissions even wrote an extra note on my acceptance letter that directly referenced things in one of my mini-essays, so that was just excellent.  now i should hear from all my other school within the next week.  and now i know for sure that my future career path isn't hobo.

i've been bad and haven't updated in forever, i know.  i'll try and recap the most important stuff.  i got my part in ""a chorus line,"" the character's name is greg and he's got a good chunk of song.  hopefully i can get the dancing down (i know the steps, but looking graceful doing them is hard).  um...we had a town election which ended up in a one vote difference between the two contenders for mayor, so let that be a lesson in civics for all of you.  and since i don't have homework anymore, my new afternoon routine is as follows:

-run/jog 1.5 miles, do push ups and crunches
-shower
-watch csi
-have dinner anywhere from 6-11 (depends on when my dad gets home)
-watch more csi
-write possible submissions to the literary magazine

seriously, that's every night.  i actually am quite happy with it.

the trial dad's working on is going ok, i think.  he gets home late all the time though - the guy's really rich/important so they work crazy hours every day of the week.  but he does get easter off, and the night before, so we (me, dad, mom, aunt) are going to see ""spamalot"" that day.  which should be cool.

oh, look at the time.  i should be watching csi."

"event","guess what happened at school today!  BOMB THREAT!

note: i am only cheery about this because i got out of calculus and because there was, in fact, no bomb.

so at the very beginning of latin (round about 8:30), our principal came onto the intercom and was like, ""this is a seriosu announcement.  there's a bomb threat.  so everyone should leave.""  those were pretty close to his exact words.  thankfully, no one was an idiot, so we proceeded down from the hill my high school is on and eventually arrived at the ""main street school"" (grades 4-5, located on, surprisingly, main street).  and all 500 of us crowded into the gym.  so my friends and i tried to go to the mall, because that's the natural response to evacuation, but sadly the doors were very well blocked.  so we sat around the gym for a while.  i called my mom to tell her why there were so many horns oing off in the town, but she wasn't home.  i walked around a bit, asked varioud teachers for some info, but no oen really had any idea what was going on.  i ended up sitting with katie and danny while listening to my sri lanken rap music.  it's not a bad way to pass an hour in an overcrowded gym, lemme tell ya.  then a bunch of kids left for a field trip which had already been scheduled, and i debated going to sleep on the floor, but suddenly we started to move en masse towards the exits, which i guess meant that someone decided the bomb wasn't real.  i was a bit skeptical about the police's ability to search our whole school in 40 minutes, but everyone's response to my fears was ""dogs,"" dogs which can apparently do some very amazing things.  but whatever.  i went to english and mr sim decided that we didn't need to have a real class because of the scare, so i sat around again with my music while ana, tristan, romit, and rachel discussed fetuses and tickling.  then no teacher in econ, so clara and alison and i headed into town (second time walking down the hill, cause clara couldn't drive up) for lunch.  sadly, we overestimated our willingness to then walk back up the hill, as we attempted to use alison like a hooker to attract old men so they would drive us.  that plan failed.  then the rest of my classes didn't really register.  fun day.

right after school, i ahd my college interview with tufts, which went fine, much like my others, except for the fact that i had a tickle in my throat which made me cough about every ten seconds.

then rehearsal for ""brigadoon,"" which was tiring as anything but should be good once people finally learn their lines.  this was my night as a lead (it's double cast), and i liek to think i did a good job of conveying both alcoholism and severe depression, hidden by a mask of sarcasm.  but i need different shoes.

now, green tea ice cream."

"event","economics was not a slaughter!  awesome!  that's really all that needs to be said, though.

after the exam, i went with alison, clara, and danny to barnes & noble.  at first i was going to go into the city with danny, because it's tax free week and we wanted to do massive shopping, but we soon realized that it was cold and we were lazy, not to mention the paper we both had to write for russian studies.  so instead we went along with alison and clara.  i wanted to get some of the ""sin city"" books ever since cabell showed me that trailer, but the damn store didn't have any.  alison wanted some kind of manga thing, clara wanted a book for mr barry (who, on the drive over, we decided we would all marry if we were 20 years older, because we love mr barry), and danny wanted starbucks.  so we mostly ended up sitting the humor section, reading each other little snippets from boooks and being far too loud.  in the end i got a copt of ""out"" magazine with a swimsuit photo shoot, so i think that was a success.  then we made stops at gap (where i couldn't buy anything because i had paid for alison's lunch), best buy (where i couldn't buy anything because all the cheap dvds sucked), and mandy's (where i couldn't buy anything because it is a store for girls, which one very severe store assistant reminded me when she saw me in the area of the changing rooms, where i was helping clara decide on shirts).  then we all became very tired, so we went home.  i had a nap which ended around 3:40 after three phone calls all within the space of ten minutes.

"event","i have completely lost track of the days - between a midterm week which also included a snow day (wednesday) and the once regular pattern of brigadoon rehearsals shifting out of whack, time has slipped past me.  but my mother claims it's sunday.  so i think i'll believe her.

midterms have, in general, been ok.  first i ahd math - two sections, one with the calculator, one without.  i think i liked the one without more.  it was much easier to rely on my memorization skills.  then i would have had econ wednesday, but i guess the total lack of snow we got was just too much for the school to handle, so all the tests were moved til tomorrow, meaning one less day of class!  thursday was english, very early in the morning, but only 50 multiple choice questions, which took me about 35 minutes.  though one question tried to get us to choose whether the word ""span"" meant ""span of an arm,"" ""span of a hand"" or perhaps ""span of a life.""  that was a bad question.  then latin friday - i was most nervous about this test, because there's a lot to remember when translating latin.  they have all these weird rules.  anyway, it involved translations of both passages we had gone over and passages we had never seen, all from the aeneid.  i think i did pretty well, though.  i felt comfortable with what i wrote (though i now remember a few dumb mistakes i made).  my latin teacher, ms cella, is one of those teachers who will walk around and look over your shoulder during a test, which normally scares me, but this time she looked at my paper and said ""good job, jim.""  that made me happy.  so econ midterm tomorrow, very early.  blech.

thursday, friday, and saturday i had rehearsal for brigadoon; on saturday we had to be off book.  they went pretty well, nothing much more than normal problems.  except the choreographer was going to have a nervous breakdown after we spent 30 minutes on one section of a dance number.  two week until opening night.

i was hoping maybe to get through ""lolita"" this weekend, which i've been sort starting for like, two weeks now, but i wasn't able to.  there's a lot there - it's dense, but good.  friday night i got in a good 80 pages, then saturday after rehearsal i read about 30 more until i was enticed away by dinner and then ""mulan"" on tv.  anyway, i want to finish it soon.  

and now i have possibly studying ahead of me.  but i might blow that off."

yeah, that's right.  i've been on a game winning streak.  i'm normally pretty set with trivial pursuit, with risk it's 50/50, and as stated above, monopoly is my kryptonite.  but in risk i managed to secure north america, south america, and australia with countries in asia and europe.  we stopped the game because we had a party to go to, and i won.  then trivial pursuit (90s version) was fun, i was winning, then we started the game over, and i was winning again.

but then monopoly came.  i thought for sure i was doomed.  but then, somehow, i managed to put hotels on every property (8 all together) and get enough money to beat casey, who had somehow amassed like a million dollars using only railroads and utilities.  it was amazing.  we played until 1:30 am.  this is my life now.

i'm sure you were all very interested in all that.

-a dance to the music of time, anthony powell</lj-cut>

so that's all that.  i'm very pleased.  plus i think everyone liked the gifts i got them, which is even better.  my mother is some sort of savant of gift giving - she starts buying like sometime in june and gets the most amazingly interesting things that perfectly match your interests/personality.  and we all strive to be like her with our gifts.  also, this year i made sure to get her two gifts (a flower holder thing and a day at the spa) and put stuff in her stocking, because she does so much work sometimes hers is a little empty.  and then the two parties were good.  the one at my house was surprisingly small - we were expecting about 60 family members, we only got about 40.  not including all the babies, which there are a lot of.  and there were no outbursts or people falling into the tree (which has happened), so it was very nice.

and now, i might sleep.  i love vacation."

"event","my mother is trying to convince me to help her cook up a big ol' batch of hardtack with her.  this is for the historical society...thing down at the elementary school tomorrow.  i would much rather continue to sit here and read about jude law in people magazine.  also she probably won't be cooking it the original way, which involves insects of various sorts.  but she has convinced me to find some sea shanties for her.

i visited skidmore yesterday.  i liked it a lot - it's one of my safeties/targets, but it's nice to know that there's one that i'll like if i go there.  but i still haven't visited bard, so i could like that one too.  i met someone who knew someone from the grade above me; we talked for a bit while waiting for the tour.  it was bizarre to meet someone like that in such a random place and i think for some reason it made me feel more comfortable.  anyway, the college was nice and liberal artsy and the people all seemed cool.  also, it's sarah's top choice and one several other people's lists, so if i go i'll most likely have company.  

spent a lazy day reading/watching tv.  

i think it would be totally amazing to be in a photo shoot with david lachapelle because his pictures are awesome.  they look like so much fun just to be in."

"event","yesterday i went to the westchester chapter of glsen's ""healing the hurt"" conference in white plains with three other kids from my gsa and our teacher advisor.  first thing i realized: i should have brought more people.  some schools had like, twenty kids there.  second thing i realized: i should have come last year.  because this conference was amazing.  it really charged me with energy about the gsa and the stuff we've been doing.  i went to two workshops, on called ""lgbt 101"" and the other called ""trangedered 101.""  the first was ok, but there wasn't anything i didn't already know involved, which was sad.  but would have been very informative had i not known the stuff i, uh, know.  the second one was <b>AMAZING</b> - it was so powerful and so informative i was blown away.  it's a subject i don't know as much about as i should.  the presenter, a transsexual man, talked about how there are so many things involved with gender identity, and gender expression, and biological sex.  he presented it as three circles, the largest being ""gender varient,"" which really encompases most people - tomboys, effeminate guys, any person who has attributes both masculine and feminine.  inside that is ""transgendered,"" which is anything from cross dressers to people who are ""gender queer.""  then inside that is the smallest circle, ""transsexual,"" which is people who feel their gender (which is like your inside feeling, kinda) doesn't match their biological sex.  not only did i get all this really good info, but it was very much displaying how we all don't fit into specific groups which is very unifying.  and he talked about his experience as a transsexual person, and it was so intense.  there was also a ""networking"" workshop, which involved talking to other gsas about their activities and that gave us some great ideas.  so here's what we're working on - 

-possibly changing the name from GSA to GSTA, which may not seem like a big thing but feels very important
-donating LGBT books to the library (50% done)
-changing the school's discrimination policy to include sexual orientation and gender identity
-having a gsa movie night (this thursday!)
-giving teachers ""safe zone"" stickers/signs to put up
-AIDS awareness day (coming soon (dec. 1))
-talking to middle school health classes

so much to do now, and i'm glad because the four of us who went feel so ready to be active and make all these really excellent changes.

in other news, i got my report card - A+ econ, A civil war, A ap geo, A peer leadership, A english, A- art, B+ ap latin, B ap calc, 3.79 gpa.  yay!  also, mr barry, my civil war teacher (and ap american history teacher last year) said the recommendation he wrote for me is the best he's ever written.  also he nominated me for an award thing, the name of which is something like ""martin luther king legacy award"" something.  so it's been a pretty cool two days in most respects.

in the future - oh jesus, i will be hearing back from vassar much sooner than i believed.  that?  is fucking frightening."

"event","i saw ""wicked,"" finally, thursday night.  two broadway shows in two nights, not a bad streak i think.  oh my good lord it was amazing.  of course i loved the soundtrack, and i loved the book, but seeing it live was so good.  though it is really different than the book - toned down a bit for the broadway audience, a happier ending, all that.  i decided i wouldn't be able to live with myself if i didn't wait outside to meet idina menzel, the woman who won the tony award this year for playing the wicked witch.  there's a rather sizeable crowd wehn i go, and i wait there for about an hour (being totally covered in green makeup probably takes some time to undo) before she comes out.  in that time i get glinda's autograph (i also saw her in ""urinetown"" last year, she was hilarious and i told her that), and fiyero's autgraph (played by joey mcintyre of new kids on the block, so that was interesting), and flirted with a cute boy from ohio.  when i first go, i notice him standing next to me, and of course i'm like, ooo, he's cute.  so i'm just waiting around, and then he asks who the person coming out of the stage door is, and i answer.  we say a few little things back and forth.  this, i think, was my shining moment though:

cute ohio boy:  wow, it's really cold.
me:  yeah, sometimes...in november.

what the hell was i trying to say there?  i have no idea.  well, he didn't notice.  we talked more, his name is brad, he's a junior, second time in nyc, etc...so that was fun.  then idina menzel comes out and very quickly starts signing autographs.  i had this while little thing ready to say to her, but she looked so tired and was probably aching to sleep so i just said she was incredible.  but i met her!  AHHHHHHH!

then, walking back to grand central station, i walked by rufus wainwright.

yes.  I KNOW.  i left a very giddy and non-sensical message on tristan's cell phone, being that it was 12 am, and finally got home.  mom and dad were kind enough to let me sleep in until 2nd period.  the day was a nothing day - friday after a day off, a lot of subs for some reason, no real work.  i mostly wanted to sleep and show people my autographed playbill.  but i did manage to get a spontaneous nose bleed in the middle of english.  is it that time of year already?  cause i really missed that spur of the moment bleeding.

then at rehearsal for ""brigadoon"" i got my part upgraded from ""harry"" to ""jeff.""  which is one of the leads, so that's pretty cool.  i still haven't looked at the script, though, so i'm not totally sure what it means.  then i fell asleep at 7:30 and woke up at 9 this morning.  spent a good lazy mronign watching tv, and now i've just stolen this time to update while the rest of my family sets up for my cousin's christening tomorrow."

"event","i just got back from seeing ""the producers"" with the audience club at my school.  of course it didn't have matthew broderick or nathan lane in it anymore, but it <b>did</b> have hunter foster in it, who i saw in ""urine town"" and who i heard was excellent in the revival of ""little shop of horrors.""  and he was awesome.  our seats were all the way up in the nosebleed section, which at first sent me into a bit of a freak out (it was really high guys), but i eventually forgot all about it.  the play was hilarious, but i'm sure most of you have heard that.  then we waited outside the stage door to meet hunter foster and we did and we acted like total spazes because he's really cute and i'm sure he was totally freaked out.  but it was still awesome.  thankfully i didn't have to skip the first dance of the year, traditionally the only worthwhile one, to go to the show.  they were originally scheduled for the same night, but they got a kid in my grade, julian, to dj, and he was caught in a janitor's closet today hooking up with a freshman girl.  which was a problem being that he's 18, and also in school.  so it was postponed.  

as i drove home from the school after the bus dropped us off, my dad said that my mom was watching ""south park,"" and it was funny.  and that we should all watch it together.  if that's not a family activity, i don't know what is.

i was going to visit bard tomorrow, but my family decided we were really lazy.  and that i would have a very bad and mysterious headache tomorrow morning.  yay for sleeping in.  and for veterans!"

oh wow, excellent weekend.  i went to RISD to see casey and dillon.  friday night we went to the artists' ball, apparently the largest RISD party of the year.  the costumes were amazing, as you would expect from art studehnts.  lots of boys did not wear shirts.  in some cases pants (two boys went as ""adam and steve"").  i approved.  a college party!  it was everything they tell you they are...after that, casey, dillon, and i went back to casey's room and hung out with her friends.  i was glad we got along, i was mostly worried about being awkward around them.  saturday we went shopping for tara's birthday, then to the mall.  we saw ""the incredibles,"" which was wonderful, probably my favorite pixar movie yet.  go see it.  then we went to a japanese restaurant, came back to the dorms, and watched ""law & order: svu"" for about four hours followed by a showing of ""mean girls.""  good stuff you guys.  i'm totally leaving out so much detail, but i really liked it there.  i'm certainly going back soon.

"event","this morning all i had left was anger, disappointment, and a faint glimmer of hope.  by 11:30 the glimmer was put out when i heard that john kerry gave up ohio.  and now, after a day of what seems like the worst possible outcome, all i think i'm left with is the disappointment.  

i went to pennsylvania with the young democrats club in my school yesterday - 45 of us in a regular school bus for two hours, waiting to go shout on street corners in bucks county.  it was amazing, maybe one of the most amazing times of my life.  i came home thinking that america knew how to go, that it had finally seen through the spins and the screens put on by this administration.  and then as the numbers for kerry slowly fell, and eleven states banned gay marriage, and we lost seats in the senate, it was like i was shot in the chest.  this wasn't the america that honked for us and waved peace signs from their cars.  this was the america that screamed ""fuck you,"" that made obscene gestures, that threw buckets of dirty water at us.  and it was winning.  and i just went to sleep, because how can you fight something like that?  it was everywhere.  i woke up again at four and checked.  then at five.  then at 6:30.

and i just couldn't take it during economics.  joe who sits behind me mentioned the bans on gay marriage, and i made a grunting acknowledgment of them.  he asked if they passed, and i told him that yes, all of them did.  and when he raised his hands and said well, if that's what the people want, then democracy worked.  and i just blew up at him, right there in econ.  what would you say about democracy if we voted to enslave black people again, joe?  would that democracy work for you?  he stared at me and i said don't you ever say anything like that to me again.  

so maybe i'm not bereft of anger.  i can still feel it twisting down in the center of my abdomen, stretching down my arms, aching through my ears.  those people who think they're so good because of their old book and their clean lives and i just want to vomit because of them.  i want to punch them in the stomach and take their children away and laugh when they cry about the injustice of it all.  i can't fathom it, how they don't feel the loss of all those women and men.  why they can't see the anger of the world.  america is some shining castle on a hill and we can just look down on the world and force them this was and that.  we have the mandate of heaven.  and all they really have are dark sunglasses that they wear to keep their own radiant, luminous glow of purity from hurting their eyes.  it blinds them from everything real, from people.  and now that the country has chosen bush, now after four years of bumbling maleficence, if the majority of people want him then they deserve whatever problem bush eventually deals them.

and now most of all i won't stop doing what i was doing.  i can only hope that will the message the beaten will take from this."

"event","oh my god, lazy mondays totally rock.  i got up at 10:30, sorta lounged around reading terry pratchett.  then had lunch, courtesy of mom and her new addiction to shopping at whole foods (chicken tenders and mashed potatoes, which i can only guess were organic in some fashion).  and then, for some reason i can't think of because i had no real reason to be so tired, i continually fell asleep in random places - on my desk, leaning back in my chair, on the kitchen floor (i laid down on it, i didn't like, faint).  so my mom made me take a nap until 5:30.  i decided as i still have a bit of homework to do, i would make a quick jaunt down to geordanes to pick up some delicious frappacino drinks.  mmmmcaffine.

the three day weekend was fine.  well, actually, pretty good, especially in relation to the amount of sleep i got.  friday was rough, though - straight from school to rehearsal for brigadoon to rehearsal for luck stiff.  which all ended at...9:30, i think.  there was a lot of falling down involved, so now i have a really big vaguely greenish bruise on my knee.  so we cut out on that and go to fridays (on friday, i know - i feel that's mostly a faux pas, but whatever), we being me, danny, danny p, ali, amanda, natalie, jen, and sarah.  i didn't really know jen or sarah that well, and they were mostly not talking to me during the food and all, but they seemed pretty chill.  i think our waiter hated us - i know i would hate a group of nine kids who are generally pretty loud and in the end only tipped ten percent, which i didn't want to do but i had already paid like, $30, and in truth he did forget to bring us napkins until the fourth time we asked him, at which point we had finished eating.  i hadn't really seen most of these people outside of school/rehearsals and it was a good time.  i made plans with ali to go shopping/get our eyebrows waxed, the date of which will be chosen in the near future.

saturday was my cousin matthew's wedding to julie, one of my favorite in-laws EVER, along with her sister grace, who is married to my cousin billy (billy and matt are brothers, so it's two brothers marrying two sisters, which is neither weird nor illegal), because they can keep up a really good conversation and know interesting things about random stuff.  anyway, it was a wonderful wedding, similar to how i would want mine, i think - it was at billy's house, which is very pretty, with a nice big tent in the backyard with pretty lights.  the ceremony was in the living room, and was about five minutes long, which is really nice for those watching, but also really sweet, because what it lacked in flourish it made up for in sentiment.  there was one thing i'm still not sure of, which was that there was no main meal, just lots and lots of appetizers.  of course, those appetizers were sushi and other yummy things that don't fit into one category.  but that meant there wasn't much food in people's stomachs, which led to very drunk people.  i ended up talking to a whole bunch of people i didn't know at all, which was not my normal experience.  and i mean at all, like, first time meeting them kinda thing.  i'm not even sure how it happened, but it was always about the fact that i'm going to college next year, and what i wanted to do, and what i was currently doing, and ""so i hear you've chosen vassar.""  which i have no idea how everyone knew but if i heard one more time was going to lead to greivous bodily harm.  seriously y'all, i heard that exact phrase at least eleven times.  but at least i had something to talk about.  and there were fireworks!  which was nice and unexpected, and i guess were for columbus day, which...i don't know.  is that a tradition in some places?  also, the whole time we were wondering where hugh was, because he never showed up at our house, so we figured he was still down in tennessee at this queer camp ground thing.  of course when we get home, we realize that he though the wedding was sunday, not saturday, and so he showed up later that evening.  

sunday i, get ready for this, was in a shooting for a suicide prevention special.  like, actually.  isn't that bizarre?  this guy contacted cagle, the woman who runs the acting troupe i'm in, and asked her for good kids to be in it.  so i went to a park in hastings with nick and did this thing.  it mostly was nick looking sad, and me looking like i cared.  which actually means nodding a lot, apparently.  they weren't going to use our voices, so we could say anything.  mostly talked about the presidential debate, which sometimes made it hard to keep a straight face.  i got paid $25, too.  that was cool.

then i hung out with tara, who was back from college for the weekend.  it was fun, and a lot like the old days, mostly because there was actual driving places, which i sorely miss.  we went to see ""resident evil 2: apocalypse.""  it was about as bad as expected.  oh!  before we did that though, we went to best buy, which i can no longer go to, because i spent all of my money on dvds.  but they're good dvds - ""buffy the vampire slayer,"" ""go,"" and ""saved!""  so that made me really happy, because i got two of them for $6, but it also meant i had very little money.  which i then spent on the movies and going out to eat, which made me wonder how much i used to spend when i did that like, every day over the summer.  then we picked up danny after the movie and watched ""saved!"" at my house.  it was definitely funnier than i remember it being.  i am amazed by mcauley culkin's ability to not look like he's in his late twenties.  and patrick fugit is totally cute.  also, every time i watch it, i like mandy moore just a little bit more (no pun intended).  they left and i watched ""go"" all by my lonesome.  good movie.  part of me wishes i could live like that, but then the rest of me is totally chicken because it would involve so many illegal things i can't imagine i wouldn't be caught.  but it's good to at least experience in a movie (oh wow, is that totally lame?).

i should go do college stuff.  and eat.  i smell steak."

"event","got back for maryland today at about four.  mom and dad went to the church sale, which i opted out on.  they said it was pretty bad anyway, so i didn't miss much.  so i walked home, walked to dog, and checked the messages/mail.  nobody around, it seems, so i'll most likely be heading over to the video store again.

maryland overall - more southern than i expected, very nice in baltimore, and really, really humid.

i really liked johns hopkins, actually.  baltimore was surprisingly nice - i had heard nto so great things about it, though i can't really remember where i got the info from, so maybe i made it up.  we arrived just as the info session started, but the man running it was pretty bad.  he didn't seem to have all that much info, and what he did have he gave up very, very reluctantly for some reason.  then we got to the tour.  the campus was gorgeous, all old brick buildings and such, and our tour guide was very imformative.  as it turns out, while college mostly known for it's graduate program and the sciences, it has one of the top ten english programs in the country.  there were other nice things - all freshman year grades are pass/fail, lots of study abroad programs, and no core curiculum.  so in the end i liked it much more than i was expecting to.  and as i said above, i was impressed by the city.  the buildings especially were very stylized and different from one another, at least in the harbor area.

st johns i didi not like as much.  first of all, for the shallowest reason, there are about 430 students.  TOTAL.  if i went there, i would actually be going somewhere smaller than my high school, which i don't want to do in so many ways.  also, it's completely core curriculum.  everyone takes every class, there are no electives at all.  the classes are: greek, math, science, chorus, french, and theory.  that's it.  for four years.  you do nothing but these things.  it's all based around ""the great books,"" starting with euclid and aristotale and such.  the furthest they go is the 19th century, i believe.  so it wasn't really me.  also, annapolis is kinda small.

weekend was all over the place - saturday was pretty depressing.  i stayed in all day watching movies to take my mind off things.  good movies, though - ""but i'm a cheerleader,"" ""wilde,"" ""mystery men,"" ""charlie's angels 2.""  ok, maybe some questionable stuff, but it was loud and fun so it did the trick.  after tlying in bed for a while my parents got me out to dinner with johnny and his friend mike, down at il sorriso.  the food was good, as usual, so it snapped me out of the funk for a while.  

then sunday was busy.  we (me+parents) went into the city with johnny, but he ditched us.  so we had brunch with hugh down in park slope at a place called ""cocette.""  they had yummy omeletes.  there was shopping after, but i was tired by that point so i was pretty much disinterested.  we get home, i finish up my homework, and go for a walk.  then i picked up chinese for hugh and myself and watched i love the 90s.  i am so totally cool.

school's been pretty easy, in general.  and, dare i say it, fun.  i think.  at least the days are going quickly, so that could be the reason.  we got a new teacher advisor for the gsa - ms succich, who volunteered for the position (we get no funding as a newer club).  ms ippolitto was good, but it was just too hard having a middle school teacher as the advisor - i'm not even allowed in the building until school's offically over.  anyway, the only class that's scaring me is calculus.  and maybe latin.  anyway, tomorrow there's an assembly zero period - it's for freshman to meet with club leaders, peer mentors, and peer leaders.  and i am all three. then we go off the ""field day,"" the start of peer leadership for the freshman.  it should be good as long as the weather holds - it's basically a day of bonding games down at the park.  no clases.  then wednesday, then four day weekend for rosh hasshana, during which i'm heading to baltimore for college visiting.  woo?

play auditions tonight, after i go grocery shopping with lara and amanda (my group partners) for tomorrow.  and homework, but since there are no classes tomorrow and this is a bit of a joke week, it shouldn't take me very long."

seriously though, i think it's going to be a really excellent year.  my classes, while kinda difficult, are all ones i'm interested in taking, at least.  well, except math.  the only worry will be college.  however, i told my aunt i was leaning toward vassar, and she thought it was an excellent match for me.  and that i have a good chance of getting in.  also on the college front, i have four essays done already - i was wondering if i could send one to some of you for comments?  like perhaps a certain grad student who writes really, really well and whose opinion would mean a lot to me?  so that will be my big stress, i hope.

as for the birthday weekend, i went with mom and dad up to the catskills on the boat -  my cousin kevin and his wife and son came along as well, and anne was there.  it was a really beautiful weekend, great weather, but i was inside finishing up my econ summer work.  like, all weekend.  there was not a time when i wasn't eating or sleeping when i wasn't doing that damn thing.  the book was good though, so it didn't totally destroy me.  we had a birthday dinner with my favorite kind of cake ever - it's from a shop up in catskill and it's a sort of vanilla fudge oreo thing.  i love it so much and i used to have it at every birthday when i was younger.  i got the buffy season five dvd's, kill bill volume 2, tickets to see wicked (awesome), and gift certificates to the gap and j crew.

so now i'm gonna go to bed.  wish me luck for tomorrow."

i reeserved a book of short stories about the end of the world, which i heard about from ps, down at the library.  it's taking forever to come in (the libraries around here are all hooked up).  hopefully it will be in tomorrow.  business days and all.

"event","(believe me, i will explain that)

so i'm back now!  it's good to be back.  sleeping in my bed with my cat and pillows was heavenly after sleeping on the boat and all the different hotel rooms.  but back to the trip - 

this is how the trip was planned out, for reference:
wednesday to friday, galway
friday to saturday, the boat up the shannon river
saturday to tuesday, dingle (southern coast of ireland)

and, thankfully, all went as planned.

the boat was cool, if a little cramped.  we visited lots of small town, all with charm and such.  of course the view was always beautiful.  if ireland is anything, it is beautiful.  we saw old ruins, lots of gravesetones (three i found with my name, one with my moms, five with my dad/brother's, and one with my other brother's).  also i met a lot of my irish relatives.  it's great to have such a net in a country you don't live.  even though we hadn't seen some of them since the fifties, they welcomed us.  

we went to a beach in dingle, and that was the most amazing thing i have ever seen.  it's at the bottom of sheer cliffs, which have streams and gullys all along them, and the water was a dazzling blue and green.  it was interesting to know i was seeing the opposite side of the atlantic.  

my fear of heights played into a lot of this.  ireland has a lot of cliffs, or high mountains, and a lot of fast drivers on narrow roads.  so i was a little nervous for some of the drives.  the roads are almost impossibly tiny.

i read a lot - lies my teacher told me, life of pi, we were the mulvaneys, the blind assassin, the number one ladies detective agency.  very good stuff.

and now i'm back.  woo-hoo.

eta - oops, i promised an explanation (i do that a lot, forget to include the title).  so, while my brother was still working at harvey milk, he was trying to convice this girl to go to a tutoring session, which she refused for weeks.  so he finally convinces her to try one, and the day she's supposed to go, he sees her at his door.  he expects the worse.  so he opens the door, and she says, in front of a lot of other kids, ""tutoring is cunt, miss thing!""  which is a good thing.  it's better to hear in person, but trust me, it was funny."

-i got a claddagh ring.  i probably spelled that wrong.  and it seems a bit cliche, but whatever.
-toured the cliffs of mohher (pronounced ""more"").  had the worst tour guide ever, wouldn't stop talking, and repeated things at least three times.  but the cliffs were great.  as my dad said - just a little bit bigger than the cliffs of less.
-met a circus performer who challenged my brother to a balance contest (hugh lost).
-galway is like, made up of people who dance and juggle fire and swallow swords.  street performers everywhere.
-my family got me drunk on cider.  well, only a little drunk.  i am now a hooligan.

going to the boat today, then going up river.  write more later, maybe when i get back.  bye all."

chicago went on.  the audience really liked it, even though we screwed up a lot.  whatever, i think i did pretty well.  it does look really cool, and the scene work is really good, even if some of the numbers are a little messy.  but nobody who's watching cares, apparently.

i read ""eats, shoots and leaves"" last week.  it was good - cleared some stuff up for me.  for instance, i would write ""anees's house"" and ""chris's house,"" but not ""jesus's house.""  the correct way is ""jesus' house.""

i love spring.  i love the leaves, they make me happy.

also, i love driving around with dillon in his convertable in the warm weather.  we just drive around anywhere and talk about whatever.  it's always very relaxing.

i went to my cousin-kinda's first communion, it was very cute.  he and his brother are <b>big</b> little kids, and they are rather agrressive for five/seven year olds.  jack, the older one, said that what he wanted to get out of this very special day was ""cold, hard cash.""  good kid, that one.  spent saturday night with casey, her camp friends (billy, libby, and amanda (who goes to school with bob)), tara, jen, and dillon.  it was cool, but i had actually just expected to be doing something with dillon that night.  plans change like crazy around here, though.  we watched ""the core.""  it was awful.  no more needs to be said of it.

i've probably told most of you already, but the assembly with john cameron mitchell was excellent, and i think a lot of people really enjoyed it.  the gsa is quickly becoming the ""hip"" club in school.  mission accomplished!"

we got to the park, and that's when i told them my dirty, shameful secret - i've never been on a roller coaster.  ever.  well, ok, one.  but i'm not sure if the kiddie coaster at playland even counts.  

so naturally, i was forced to repeatedly go on the coasters.  

and naturally, i LOVED it.

the twists and the turns and cork-screws and the loops were just...awesome.  so fun.  though i can't believe i went form never have been on any sort of <i>montagne rousse</i>, as they say <i>en france</i> to going on several with major flips and such.

anyway, it was the rocking.

friday - two hour delay at school, postponing all my tests and stuff till tomorrow and tuesday.  then i went to rehearsal, which turned into just two hours of dancing.  owie.  after that, the family went into the city for mom's birthday - it was good to see everyone, i hadn't talked to them in a while.

saturday - saturday was good.  i went to the peace rally in the city with mike long, andrew, kim, and jordan.  which was really fun, but once again, lots of strain on the feet.  i thought there definitely too much of deceptive thing going on by the organizers.  it was like, ""come for iraq, stay for palestine, haiti, korea, and veiques.""  not that i don't agree with some of that, but it was a little under-handed.  i am also a stupid, stupid person for once again crushing on straight boys.  but...i'll live.  argh.  argh.  anyway, after that, i skipped seeing ""damn yankees"" and went to see ""dawn of the dead"" instead.  i feel that was a smart movie on my part.  yay zombies!  rawrgragleraaar!

sunday - sat prep class.  got a 1520 on my latest practice, but i like to imagine i was rushing and/or not paying attention, and will get higher on the test (wow, i sound pretty pretentious there).  but then i had to walk home becuase i was stupid and didn't bring my cell phone, and it was like four miles and it was really cold.  that was fun.

so that is why i owe my feet.

"event","geiss is not going with me to the prom.  it is official no, even though i suspected it ever since...well, since before i asked him.  and i let myself get all believing with the joy, and i forgot what a god-damned flake he is, and he'll barely even talk to me anymore, so screw him, except i have no date to the prom, and i don't want to not go, because that'll be a blow to my pride.  

also, i still like him, because i can't help myself.  and sometimes he's not really, really stupid.  and i know he means well.  but when those are the best things i can say about someone, maybe i should rethink my burning desire for friendship.

fuck.  fuck him.  gah.

becca's house was major fun.  but i missed sarah and hannah.  

there will be a gsa back sale tuesday, so remember that people who go to my school."

"event","today was pretty fun, actually.  field trip for english, all day, so no class.  we went into the city for a writing/drama workshop with an inner-city school and the manhattan theater club.  first we went to this other school, and we all do the whole culture shock thing, and then we do some improv skits and work with some stuff we had already done.  the scenes were all about suicide and unrequited love, because that ties in with the second part...so after lunch, we go to see a new play, ""drowning crow,"" which is a modern, hip-hop version of chekov's ""seagull.""  the reviews had all been kinda shady, so i went into it with a bad attitude, i guess.  that being said, however, i didn't think it was that awful - the pacing wasn't great in the middle, and i think they never tied together the themes of unreceived love and importance of past knowledge (which was sort of thrown in in the last act, i felt).  there was definitely something good there, though, and i thought the cast did a really wonderful job with what they were given.  the audience was shit, but that's because it was all high school kids.  they laughed at sad moments, and were generally rude (i got spit on.  yeah.  from the balconey.).

anyway, i came home to find the toilet in my room.  i was distressed, but mom explained that it's because we're redoing the bathroom, and we needed storage room.

then i read ""the metamorphosis"" and ""the penal colony.""  i guess it became a kafka evening.  i read the first for english, and the second because i was intrigued, but both were good.  also, deeply disturbing.  with ""metamorphosis,"" i was really grossed out, because i truly, madly, and deeply hate bugs.  but then i just felt sorry for everyone involved.  as for ""penal colony,"" this is why i am reluctant to sew."

"event","it was really, really beautiful here in ny for like, a week.  and now it's supposed to snow tonight into tomorrow.  that sucks it so bad.  i hate snow.

i have not updated.  i am a bad puppy.

i was going to wait and update tonight once i got the email with the cast list of chicago (the most recent play), but it looks like it's not going to be sent out tonight.  which kinda pisses me off, since she told us it would be by monday, giving her the whole weekend to work out a list she said she had almost totally finished.  argh.  anyway, i think i'll get mary sunshine, the female reporter played by a guy, but the part i really want is amos.  fingers crossed.

lots of stuff...ok, a week ago friday, i want to see the hastings' one act plays with rebecca and lucia.  we met izzy there, so i got to see her again.  they were pretty good, on average.  specifically, i went because i was invited by andrew, this guy i met at backy's party.  very nice guy.  i was excited to see him again, since we've only spoken online since the initial meeting.  he was really good in his scene.  so afterwards i tag along the the diner with the rest of the cast, since i know a good many of them.  andrew comes over to talk for a while, then mike long came over to talk, even though i hadn't seen him in half a year.  that was fun.  and finally, ex-boyfriend jordan came over to talk and invite me to his birthday party, which i couldn't go to.  but man, i was <b>on</b> that night.

otherwise...oh, hung out with geiss and colleen friday.  we tried to see gracie's talent show, but the tickets were sold out.  i find that odd for a talent show, but whatever.  so we just came back to my place and watched a bad horror movie.  it was fun.  it was good.

we're like, redoing the whole house.  repainting rooms and all that.  it's really cool.  but it involves a lot of cleaning and furniture moving.

and i have sufficiently divulged enough info to clear my update guilt.  i'll try to be better."

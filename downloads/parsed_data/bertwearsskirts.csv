I'm leaving. So is one of the doctors, apparantly. I knew there was something screwy going on with my medications. If they find something that works, they're supposed to keep you on it, right? But they kept switching me, and I'd get these little notices telling me I wasn't supposed to eat certain stuff or that I had to stop taking something because it might mix bad with something new they were giving me. Weird stuff was happening too, like blackouts and getting sick all the time, that they wouldn't tell me about and when I told them about it or they saw me they'd get all interested and write it down and act really strange.

So I called my old social worker and told her about it. She did some digging, and found out that that my doctor was using me as a guinea pig, testing medicines. Some of that shit I didn't even need, they just wanted to see what it would do for someone who'd been misdiagnosed.

So I'm getting out of here, finally. Johnny got to leave too and his mom said I can stay with them, and my social worker says there's going to be a court case about all this. The doctor's already left, they took him this morning, and who knows what's going to happen now.

Jepha, you will always have a special place in my heart. Hazel, you've been a great friend and an awesome roommate, even if you technically didn't even live in the room with me for more than a day or two. Jordan, you're forever one of my besties and I'll miss our hugs and cuddles. Will, take care of yourself, and I promise I'll come back to cuddle you. Sonny, I love you and I wish you two the best of luck.

((It's been a great run, but it's time for him to go. I'll still be around as Caycee for a bit and you might see me pop up as a doctor again sooner or later. Byes!!))"

This post is not friends-locked. Comment anonymously with a secret about yourself. Then we'll all try to guess who posted. Or not. But comment. It will be fun!

It can be anything, like your favorite kinky fantasy or the last wet dream you had, the last prank you didn't get caught playing on someone or the person you secretly want to bang. Just don't go telling something that would hurt someone's feelings even if they don't know who said it, cause that's not fun."

"event","<lj-cut text=""etc"">I sat down at the piano today after coming home from drivers' ed and started playing <i>Salvation is Created</i>, and then came back to the opening chord (which is really open - B F# B below middle C) and veered off and improvised for more than ten minutes. Seriously, it was actually so good I am sad I didn't record it. My sister came and asked me what I was playing and I shrugged while arpeggiating G7 and said I was making it up. I think she nearly fell over. She's been taking piano lessons for 7 years and I've never had one.

I was in at least six different keys (including D harmonic minor, various not very difficult major keys, many modes of C, and also F# major because I was like 'to hell with this white key modal shit!'), a few time signatures (6/8 is fun, but 5/8 failed and that section didn't have much of a transition) and all kinds of themes. The only failing is by the time I got to the 'end' I couldn't remember anything about my first theme, so I ended on a random Bb cadenza.

It was unbelievable.
Next time I do that, I think I might have to write it all down.

Yesterday when I was at Chinook Centre I walked into the Body Shop and there was a guy standing there greeting people and so on. I said hello and we ended up talking for a good while before I looked at anything at all. He asked me about the henna designs on my hand (for Navroz) and I told him it was the Persian New Year on the first day of spring, we celebrate it, etc etc. He showed me the tattoos on the inside of his arms - small ones, pretty tasteful - and said he'd love to get henna done to try it out. 

He was ridiculously nice, a little flamboyant and very very cute. His name is Joshua. I bought gold eyeshadow, and wished I could have stayed longer.

I want to do something crazy, like leave an envelope one day with those little henna-style body art stickers in and a note. You know? Something weird. What should I do, any ideas?</lj-cut>

... Anyway, have you ever wondered what <i>Navy Blues</i> would have looked like had Sufjan Stevens written it? I know I have. Original song titles precede the bastardised ones in case you're not familiar with the record, or heaven forbid, you can't recognise them from my Sufjanised ones.

""Travelling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.""

"event","Preface: Don't hate me. This is only a test.

four jobs i've had:
1. camp counselor (hurray for summer / camp james)
2. williams-sonoma sales associate
3. celtic knot waitress
4. babysitter (one family only for the most part, they would be my second family. yes....creepy)

four movies i can watch over and over:
1. singing in the rain
2. when harry met sally
3. newsies
4. silk stockings

four places i have lived:
1. lake forest, il
2. lexington, VA
3. evanston, il
4. chicago, il (parents new apartment: hopefully the most i will ever say i lived there will be holidays, or next summer after college (ONLY SUMMER) while i try to land a job in NY)

four TV shows i love to watch:
1. sex and the city
2. i always like Family Guy, but it's better on DVD by season, so you can watch one after the other, after the other
3. i always liked Friends, and i to this day watch reruns start to finish/but Will and Grace has to coincide in spot #3, because I really don't watch TV that often and I watch these two probably about equally.
4. ok, i would put this at #3, because i like it sooooo much more, but i've only seen a few episodes and really wish i had the patience/time to watch more Tv, but: 24 with Keifer. He's such a cutie.

four places i have been on vacation:
1. most often: Amelia Island, FL
2. most loved: spring break with the Aguas in the OC
3. most meriting future additional visits: Europe/anywhere abroad: Italy, France, London, China, Canada.
4. most exiting/inspiring: new york, NY to visit caroline and jesse.

four of my favorite dishes:
1. my dad cooked this morroccan pastry filled with ground bird of some sort and spices up the wazoo, i've never tasted anything like it. amazing.
2. pasta primavera, dad's ""buzzard's breath"" chili, or rick baylis' mexican on a winter night
3. a good piece of fish, practically raw tuna with wasabi and soy, or baked almond encrusted halibut over spinach crepes with a wild-mushroom/shallot glaze (i think that was it....at the Stained Glass in Evanston)
4. chocolate or ice cream
I'm sorry. I do favorite restaurants, (oh...wait. i also kill on a regular basis for a good duck)...not dishes. I like to try new things, I don't like repeats, therefore, I cannot say I have that many favorite dishes, I don't like to do too many things twice.

four websites i visit daily:
1. NU webmail
2. not daily, but often: facebook
3. not daily, but often: itsyourturn.com, don't make fun. i play battleship and chess online with my sister, sending little notes and messages along with each turn to keep up with each other's lives
4. not daily, but often: ? i know how to use aim. but mostly i just post away messages.

four places i would rather be right now:
1. ITALY, if i don't get out of here soon i may pass a kidney stone, or not pass it and die in my not-so-sound-sleep.
2. NEW YORK with Caroline
3. Hawaii with Tess
4. in someone else's bed, i'm not sure i'd be too picky tonight who.

four things i'm grateful for, because i really have to end this evening on a good note, (i've been cycnical enough to last me about two or three days i think):
1. i really believe now that i have someone to cry for here at NU when we do have to part, that would be my roommate, Sarah, who is probably unconscious right now at home in WI with her four gaping holes in her mouth where wisdom teeth used to be
2. a few songs this year: DMB ""dreamgirl,"" Beach Boys ""come and go with me,"" Jerry Lee Lewis ""great balls of fire,"" Weezer, ""Beverly Hills,"" and G-Love and Special Sauce ""Baby Got Sauce""
3. the friendship of distant penpals who remind me there's something else out there in the world: s.massicotte+agnes, and jake friedman
4. fresh air, when its not too cold to breathe in. This will be my second to last winter in Chitown, we hope, for a long while..."

"event","It's like these kids I babysat today. They were sick and sat at home for four hours with me in the basement, and I watched them watch three Disney movies back to back. I went to walk upstairs at one point, and was going to close the kiddy/dog-gate behind me when I saw that one of the little boys had followed me and was trying to escape the basement under my feet. I felt so sorry for him, but he couldn't run free in the house while I was going to the bathroom. He was doomed to be bored with life for the day, with a runny nose, a rotten cough, too young even to make conversation.

That's how I feel. As if I've got the burning sensation to go to the bathroom, and need to run upstairs, out of the basement to free myself, only I'm two with a cold, and doggy-gated in a hole with curiously happy cartoon characters who all seem to have miraculously happy endings to mock your own personal state of insecurity and boredom. Your only option is to wait for that moment when someone inspires you to get up off your wobbly legs and run for the exit, at that ideal moment when the opportunity presents itself. The door is thrown open and you have half a second to make your move. Don't miss it or the babysitter will discover you and lock you away again.

Who's my babysitter? I'm still a child governed by my parents. Today a man called me from a bank with which I didn't even know I had an account, or as he called it ""a trust."" How was I to know to trust this man? I'm twenty-one now, and apparently, in order to evade some tax somewhere--amid a storm of papers and mail, in files or in transit, or circulating at the nation's capitol--I'm to ""pay my own tuition"", ie: write a check out in my name to Northwestern, after my father's written a check for me to deposit in my ""own"" account, trust, god I don't know what it is.

And I think about paying my way to New York after college--what it would cost me to stay there--what it would take to make rent each month. And I think about the dollars and change I've saved up over the years, of which I used to be so proud, and think now it will afford my stay in Italy while I'm there this summer. I hope. I hope I will afford my stay in Italy this summer. I hope I will have something left over. I hope eventually to be able to pay my way back there. I hope I don't starve to death and die in a basement studio beneath a brothel or worse a Jewel-Osco. I hope I never live above a Jewel-Osco with nine cats.

I hope I don't have to sell an organ for a ""cause"" to pay for heat. But mostly I hope I don't bore myself to death.

It occurred to me the other day that I'm bored because I have no one to feed off of. That sounds creepy. I'm not justifying it. I'm ashamed. I said it was a realization. I'm not proud of it. Yes, in the past, I've learned to love something, a hobby, a job, a sport, a friend, a music genre, after someone has introduced me to it, or modeled it. I won't say I'm a sheep, a copycat. I'm a youngest sibling. It's how I was raised. I saw, I followed. I learned to appreciate things, because I appreciated the people I was with and respected and loved them. And what made me happy, did so because I was with them as I did it. I guess that isn't too shameful a way to think on it, but still, now that I'm forced to be my own person, choose my own path, something that will bear fruit for me no matter where my family divides or how many of my friends slip away to seperate states, other friends. I can't seem to find what makes me happy on my own. Acting isn't exciting on your own. You need a partner. There's nothing I loathe more than a monologue. Painting is an individual sport, but I tire of it before the job is done, always, without fail. My inspiration buys the materials, stretches the canvas, lays the paint, dips the brush, but my energy dissipates when I see my hand destroy my vision.

My writing grows worse. My peers fascinate me with their own creativity. I wish I had thought of their novellas. And then I turn to work on my own. I handed in six less pages than I should have for my final grade at the end of this quarter.
I need to be proud of myself again. I can't wait any longer. I feel sick, I feel tired and fussy, like my bladder would burst with life, and that life, that anxious swell would disperse before I could catch it. It would wet itself, escape, spill, into the sheets that cover me from facing the world, that hide me in the night. I'm tired of being the child. But I can't get past that child-proof doggy-door.

Enough sappy analogy for you? Yeah, me too.

I really wish I could get high tonight.
Why don't I have a hash connection?
Oh yes, I'm uptight."

"event","On Hubbard Street, you can dance until 2am, or until you have to catch the el from State Street back to Davis. And at Rumba, you can arrive with no one, and dance all night with someone. And when that happens, it doesn't matter so much that these past few years have been so difficult.

When you can dress up, and pretend you are confident, and begin to believe that you are so, you may find yourself enjoying the night, the people you meet, shady or fine, well-dressed or -rehearsed, and the dancers among them. You may forget that you have to sleep at all. You may stay up for several hours thereafter, after you've stopped spinning, and arrived at home, somehow in your bed, or on the rug in front of the television with the lights off, and the music playing, or no longer playing, though you hear it still.

And when I found myself in this condition, I laughed to myself, not wanting to ake off my dress, or untie the bands strapping my shoes onto my heel and around my ankle, knowing that tomorrow it might register just how badly they really hurt. My feet, that is.

And when I found myself, humming still, contented alone, contented to have had one memorable evening to go on, to feed on for the next several, uneventful days, I drunkenly didn't want to take off my dress and put on my pajamas. I wanted to pretend that my dress was not out-dated, though it is. But, in the end, I peeled it off, or it fell from my shoulders, more easily because one of the straps had snapped earlier that night. Earlier that night I was dipped down, so that my hair might have brushed the floor, so that I fell back weightless into someone's arms whose first name was all I caught and forgot by the end of the night when I ran rushing to the el track. It's hard to be concerned about getting home, or getting stranded, when you've danced all night to the beat of a foreign drumset, or maracca, or tomtom, or whathaveyou. It's hard to care who you are, or where you are. And I didn't. Care.

But the next day, I woke up in my own little bed, in pajamas, though I wished I might have had the inspiration to fall asleep naked the night before. And the blinds turned away the sun from my windows, and again I was faced with three alarms sounding at once; go to the gym! get up! make breakfast! start your work! sleep another day! forget another night! proceed proceed proceed!

And it was finished. That is all. A beautiful evening, and a stale dream of superiority. Of having been set apart for a few hours from common life, common people who don't dance, who don't get tired of being lost during the day, inferior people who don't let themselves get lost at night and think that's the smart way to go. People who dodn't need abandon to make the daylight hours more bearable. Inferior people, people who are probably a lot better off than ... well, me."

"event","You know that episode of Sex and the City?

Carrie's ""drunk at Vogue"" and can't get over the fact that ""she's drunk at Vogue!!"" Well I had a similar experience at the Lyric Opera of Chicago this past Friday night. I sold raffle tickets at mom's Fantasy Gala that she's been planning and sweating over for the past several months. And it was one of the coolest nights ever. The cabaret of singers was alright, though there weren't any big stars this year. 

But afterwards there was dinner and dancing, and I tell you, them old folksies can dance! But though the company, food, and entertainment were all delightful, the best part about the night, by far, was on our way back to the dressing room (that they'd given my mother to get ready in before the party started, since she'd been there all day setting up,) we had to go from the lobby through the theater and out one of the side doors off the far left aisle to get backstage. When we first entered the theater, from the lobby, all was dark except for little pinprick lights, like stars, studding the aisles and the chandeliers lining the balconies and walls. That, and there stood the ghost light, in the down stage right corner, in front of the heavy velvet curtain. It was a modest show of white light, but fabulously mysteriour and wonderful in keeping with tradition, (minus the placement that is...Traditional ghost lights stand stage center, the curtain up, and nothing on stage.) But it was magical, and breathtaking, and I was drunk on a bottle and a half of champagne for the night. And it wasn't night anymore, but morning, only you couldn't tell because it was dark in the theater, and there weren't any windows to remind us to go home, it's dark it's late, you ought to be in bed, Cinderella.

I didn't think either one of us, my mother or me, was capable at that moment to drive home. So we sat on the edge of the orchestra pit and look back at the boxes which were filled only an hour or two ago with table after table set with the finest crystal, silver, and linen. (Isn't that funny? They'd serve dinner to one private party in one private-party room, and another private party in the green room, and another in another private room, and a third in the boxes? I luhv it!) The night was like that theater, deep and brilliant, even through the dark. Nothing could swallow that theater up, it's the best in the nation, perhaps internationally. 

I jumped into the pit on the conductor's stand and turned around back to the audience. I sang, I don't know what, but so that I filled the whole theater. My mom was surprised enough to burst into giggles and join in. It wasn't long after that before we'd foung our way onto the stage and, shoes off, begun to sing and dance, or just wiggle a little off balance really. But I couldn't get over what it sounded like to fill that theater with my voice. My voice alone. When you sit in the audience and listen to singers like those we heard earlier that night, you wish they'd get over themselves and just where microphones, because we don't get the full impact of their voice. It's just bad accoustics that's all, I thought. Or maybe their energies were running down, but like I want to blast my stereo and have the music flood my body like a tide, I wanted those tenors, sopranos, mezzos to send thrills down my spine. But they had seemed so quiet.

Not from the stage. No, from the stage, the accoustics are best. You can hear every texture of your voice bounce back from every seat in the house, and the lights-- that haven't been extinguished yet because the staff is still sweeping the lobby to close up shop-- seem to sing back to you in echoes. Brilliant. Twas, brilliant! And I felt brilliant with brilliant champagne still coursing it's way through my body, becuase though they'd run out several hours ago, one very special waiter had kept a reserve, and returned to my mother and me throughout the night to offer us refills. Even after he had packed up the bar, he made sure we got the last glasses of champagne in the house!

Twas' brilliant and I never wake up with a hangover.

Anyway, I just thought my new userpic needed some explanation. What? What was that?
That was Anna Crunk at Lyric!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOT!"

"event","Ever listen to country to get in the mood to write?
It's funny, for a writer I do very little writing, and a whole lotta settin' the mood.
I'll get out my chocolate or red wine,
I'll turn on the music selection of the night, in this case CMT, for a visual stimulant to distract me as well,
and I'll put my hair up in a bun at the top of my head, and think about other things I could be doing instead of writing.
And finally, I end up wondering what it is I'm so afraid of writing.
When I do sit down to write.
I think I should turn off this shit, this country. It's really awful. It may be fun to let your hair down to in a country club surrounded by cutie hicks with big hats and big cocks, 
but here it just doesn't make sense.
You can't take country out of context.
Nor the writer out of the zone. So therefore, the problem remains:
finding the zone.

Let me tell you, i'm not in it. As much as I would like to be.
I don't much feel like a writer,
I spent an hour tonight watching the end of Beautiful Mind, somewhat absent-mindedly, as I tested my hand at the magnetic poetry on the refrigerator.
And I can tell you, what's on there now, maybe a few half sentences and phrases, are more interesting to me than this journal entry I'm writing here.
Artists have a really sucky life.
How I'd like to be a happy as an accountant, banker, lawyer, god knows I'd hate to be a doctor, but think of the stability in death!
The stability in fixing, or not fixing, other people's lives. Doing them up right with the subscriptioin of a pill so that they can go on and figure out what the hell it is they're going to do with their time. Will they subscribe pills? Out of a burst of inspiration that some well-off, stable, sane doctor worked magic for half an hour--after you waited in the waiting room for two-hundred and thirteen minutes.

Inspiration is so fickle. It excaped this man, whoever he is, singing with Dolly Parton. Oh funny, that was Brad Paisley apparently. He looks very young. Oh, the young and the accomplished, singing love songs with fake-breasted women three times their age. Fine, twice. Pizza,

God, Domino's commercials. I'm jealous of Pepperonis all around the world right now. To be a pepperoni is such a beautiful privilege. To be appreciated world wide for your constancy, your ever-satisfying spice, your ease at pleasing. I would eat you purely of jealousy now, but on second thought for hunger too. I think I shall make tortilla soup, because I have that. And it comes in a can and is easy.

Ah for life to be easy. It's so less satisfying. Tortilla soup will be fine for tonight, but tomorrow, I want pizza.

So long farewell, and inspire someone tomorrow, trusting that they probably need it."

Well, I do have lots better to do, but it all involves work, and WTF, this is college. That being said...)


First best friend: Sarah Reynolds. Still going strong, though from afar.

First school: Sheridan Elementary

First screen name: Um, can you have more than one? That's exciting! I want to change mine from MissNeci1785.

First pet: and last, Coco. No more perfect beast ever lived.

First piercing/tattoo: My ears. I was eighteen, and I held my sister's hand the entire time.

First big trip: L'ITALIA! Molto Bella. Mi manca, ma ritornarero a l'estate quest'anno!

First flight: I was an infant with bad ear problems. I screamed the whole time I'm sure. My mother was flying alone with her three daughters, (me screaming) (Liz who only ate apple sauce and there was none on the plane and none at any of the airports and none anywhere and all she wanted was apple sauce and she was hungerrrry) (Millie rebellious and annoyed at life but most at her hysterical mother and screaming sisters), and nearly had a breakdown and consequential divorce...until my father vowed never to let her fly alone again with kids.

First time out of the country: I think Italy? If not that, then China, no Italy most def.

First job: Camp Counseling two and three-year-olds with Caroline at the Lake Forest Rec (Hurray for Summer!)

First true love: true? Wouldn't know. Crush: man, the kid's name was Justin, it was the first grade, and he moved out of town after that one year. But his name was Justin and that was hot.

Last song you heard: The Origins of Love...yeah! Hedwig!

Last car ride: to Panera Bread to pick up Rina's and my dinner, driven by Sarah who has carted me around for the past two weekends for moral support, dropping me off at audition after audition, taking me to the grocery store and out to dinner. Good girl, greater friend.

Last time you cried: Two weeks ago, two tears, that's it. For my home on 1220 that's going going gone as of February first.

Last movie you watched: Brokeback Mountain. Yes it was good, No it wasn't THAT good. Get over it! You just think Jake and Heath are hot and are amazed that hot actors might be able to act too. Shocker!

Last food you ate: Black Bean soup and multi-grain baguette from Panera.

Last item bought: A Panera Bread dinner for myself and Rina.

Last shirt worn: not counting the one i've semi-got-buttoned-on? um, my Deer Path Junior High chorale ""Perfection is Possible"" t-shirt, at the gym.

Last phone call: To Tapscott, to see firstly if she's still alive because that's how long it's been since I've talked to her, and secondly if she wanted to go see a show tonight so I could (subplot!) see about a boy...

Last time at the mall: two weekends ago for my twenty first birthday. the DMV was closed, but the mall was open and my mom didn't know what to get me for my birthday so she took me out to find something. gotta love surprises.

Of all the things we wanted to do.
Of all the things we liked and disliked
About ourselves, about our friends,
about high school and the opposite sex.
What we used to do was keep journals
In ink, with drawings and scribbles too,
That, no matter how crude, were still better
Than any poems written there.
But when we started thinking
We started thinking it was wrong
To write a journal full of words
And spend hours on those doodles and poor poetry
When outside your door lay all the opportunities
To consolidate your lists.
And so you retreated into the world of doing,
Until a teacher years later
Reminds you once again what it was like
To take the time to dream something up.
You can't remember the last time you had a clear hope.
Your goals were swallowed down
Your ambitions confused with transcript letters
A B A C And GPA numbers.
And so after my first really befreaking bad poem in about a decade
Maybe two--maybe I'm going to be twenty one in just over one month--
I return to my lists.

"event","Sayings:

Like inside fortune cookies, they're no longer fortunes all the time. Sometimes they're just words of encouragement. Lucky numbers, although that's semi-more-traditional.

Inside the little individually-wrapped halloween bite-size dark Dove pieces. There are so many little sayings, that you have to keep eating to read them, hoping to finally get a repeat and stop eating...but then you don't get a repeat, and damn! that's vicious. a vicious vicious ploy!

Like ""like"" or other key-words that turn you off, or should...
Like ""babe.""

Who says that? Guys know not to say that. They just don't do it anymore, but then some do, and you're like ""what!?"" But depending, it's kindof okay. You're not sure just how you feel about it. Maybe it's the fact that it annoys you that makes it more attractive.

Like little promises to get together soon, until you've said so many promising sayings to end conversations that you finally owe someone to show up for yourself. Even though you want to show up for them for you, because you like them, and you honestly do want to get to know them better, and potentially let them in and love them like you wish you could love people in such a difficult, disjointed community of a school campus.

Like fibs that your parents tell you, little catch phrases of I'm fine, but what's new with you, because what they really mean is, I may not be fine, but I'd rather not talk about it, because you're a distraction from all that. They love you, hearing about your life for that exact reason, it takes them away from what's going on in their own lives. Not that they want to live through you, but because as you grow older and you concentrate your efforts on a society of family rather than friends, you limit yourself to contact with fewer and fewer people, and then you grow with each addition to the family, with kids, until they leave. And then it's only a matter of time before the last one leaves, and they're empty-nested. Empty-nested and somehow strikingly, suddenly alone. With the occasional book club anad neighbor for comfort, but their best friends are you, but you don't know it. And they want to talk all about you, but you don't know it, and you think they're denying you the priviledge of becoming best friends with your own parents, because they won't share their secrets, because there's a degree of seperation there.

Just on the mind...
...thought maybe someone would be interested to know. That is, if they're going through anything similar at the moment."

"event","I guess what I dislike is investing yourself in something, working so hard, knowing from the very beginning that it's pretty well hopeless, doing it anyway, getting hopeful, and then finding out that yes, you were right, you will fail. I'd rather just be ignorant. Always believing that if I had tried, I might have made it. Because then you can flatter yourself. You try and you remove all doubt that you fail. You=fail. Again. Alright, this is a premeditation, but it's what I feel at the present moment, and I can't help it. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm a manic depressant. I wish I could be a little optimistic when I write, but whenever I write, it's because I'm pissed off. Of course isn't that wh every artist creates art. He's pissed off about something and wants to vent in one form or another. In whatever mood he chooses to express that anger with. Ex. melancholy picasso doing the blue man with the guitar. he's pissed off and paints, but pretends to send a message of tears. i swear it. he's pissed. i look at that man, and i see what picasso was thinking. that woman that he almost painted underneath just wasn't fucking good enough. it wasn't right. so he vented and ended creating the blue guy. let me be a picasso for my journal entries, please. because i cannot be a picasso for the stage. they won't let me...

ah but that's me putting the blame on someone else. it has nothing to do with anyone but myself. they're there, waiting for me to come try out. come get the experience, come teach yourself to do better so that you can work your way up. just do it, you must start at the beginning to get to the great ends...but i'm a pussy. i'm a coward. such a fucking coward, and i hide it behind a blind of disorganization. it's not my fault i swear, i just missed the timing. it's not my fault, i swear it's just i forgot to look up monologues until it was too late. it's not my fault i just didn't audition all through my first year at northwestern. well now i've tried. i've put myself out there, made a good showing for myself, rehearsed, done all the necessary shit, followed the rule book, kept myself in time and organized, and i've come up wanting. But, above all things, i've somehow allowed myslef self-pity. i'm actually complaining. i'm such a pussy. so i'll stop. 

i just wanted you to know that i tried, actually, really tried this time. let's hope i can muster the courage to continue to try. because things are always supposed to get better from here...."

I didn't mean to sound nonchalant talking about my mom in that last entry. I've actually been pretty spooked all week. I had to go home before school started last week, to fix my computer, and when this woman told me that she thought my mother was losing it, I wanted to slap her. I mean purely that this is the kind of woman who will make drama out of anything because she's bored with life, and rightfully so in her case. She loves gossip more than my mother loves chocolate and if one of her very own friends went a little clinically loopy, I think she'd host a tea to discuss. But there is something to say for the fact that her friends are all in agreement that they're worried for my mother. She hasn't been the happiest or carefree of women in the past couple years, and she has lost weight, but I'd say that was because she's become more health-conscious not less so. She's physically fit, she eats well, yes she's stressed because our house hasn't sold and she's having to count pennies a bit more lately than in the past, but these things happen. People handle stress in different ways. My mother's always been flighty, as am I, and even when we don't have a million things on our minds, we have the worst short term memories in the world. The two of us are a pair of space-cadets, but how are her friends so concerned all of a sudden.

I asked Mrs. Linville to please justify herself. What was my mother forgetting more than usual. Oh, little things...that aren't so little. Like, she asked when Katherine would graduate from college, forgetting that she'd hosted a graduation party for her just last year.

I guess that's legitimate. You don't exactly forget your best friend's daughters graduation parties, especially when you host them. But then again, it's mom. But how long have I been brushing this off as, ""that's just my mother""? 
Sarah says that women experience serious declines in their memory after menopause. The loss of estrogen and such things which I can't exactly explain myself, but--
Here's the issue, if memory loss could be prevented with estrogen supplements, my mother still wouldn't take them, because a side effect would be an increased chance of developing ovarian cancer, and she'd rather go positively loony than have her hair fall out. Let's face it, she's already pretty loopy.  

The fact of the matter is that she and her friends, and my dad's friends are all feeling it, the strain. Two of our close friends have died, another is decaying from the inside out from an advanced case of arthritis. Some have fallen, broken hips. 

When I was home last, my dad and I were in the kitchen when we heard a bang from the basement. It took me a moment to register the fact that Mom had fallen down the stairs, but dad jumped immediately to the door and down to her side. He was lifting her off the ground before it really sunk in just how instinctive his response was. He seemed rehearsed almost in the routine. Like he knew it would happen, like it had happened before.
I don't know, I'm just scared. It's hard being the youngest, when all of your friends around you at school have younger parents and don't really know quite what you're worried about. My parents are getting old.

Three or four nights ago, I had a dream that my mother was diagnosed with something life-threatening. She had a matter of weeks, and I woke up crying. The tears were already on my cheeks, slipping down to my neck, pooling in the hallow of my collar bone, or that was cold sweat. I can't say for sure."

I watched the OC last night and didn't care two shits about it. Oddly enough. I'm very much one of those kids who gets all excited for it and times dinner so that it's ready when the show comes on. I get upset when people talk during the show almost as much as I used to get during Sex and the City. 

I go through phases, like with carrots: I'll buy baby carrots, inisist on my mother getting baby carrots at the store, because they're sweeter and easier to eat, and less maintenance because you don't have to scrape them. Then I'll rebel and not eat carrots at all for a year, and then the next thing I know, I can't stand to buy baby carrots. The big long ones in the huge ass, heavy, ten-ton bags of carrots you get at jewel are much more economical, and the flavor, though perhaps less sweet is all the more refreshing. I won't buy baby carrots any more I just won't do it. I'm munching on the big kind of carrot right now...they're all disgusting. They're bitter, and I hate having to scrape them. I'm going back to baby carrots.

I'm afraid my mother's developing alzheimers. Or rather, I wasn't afraid, but one of my mom's gossipy little friends was, and so she told me. She sat me down one day when I mistakenly asked her if I could use her internet connection because my parents are still using dial-up, and she sat me down after mom left the room and asked me if I'd noticed anything recently that was troubling my mom. I said no. She said she and all their friends were a little concerned for my mother's mental health, and I wanted her to go to hell. But I didn't tell her that.

I attract jerks. I scare nice boys. I'm asexual myself. I rest my case.

Actually, I don't: My aunt's sixty and has still never kissed a man, though she dreams one day of walking down the aisle to Handel's ""Watermusic."" My sister married a nerd, she's very happy, but she's also becoming more and more of a doofus everyday under his influence. My other sister's lonely. She just turned twenty-nine. Ok, now I'm done.

I've come to the horrible conclusion that theater was a waste of my time and my college education. Thank god I'm double majoring, but I would have liked something solid to go behind yet another major people would call ""unstable"". I like to write, but I've never really written anything. My problem is plot. I love character construction, but I can never think up a story line. My problem is character development, I'm great with description, I can beautifully describe a person, but I can't give them words to speak. 

I don't speak, I stutter.

My apartment is beautiful and cold. I guess it could be like the house we're trying so desperately to sell. My Style in Literature professor wants us to write an essay on going home. Home is different from house is different from--

I'm hungry and I couldn't get reservations for anything before eight o'clock.

I need a filling, but the dentist doesn't have time for me in the year of 2005.

I'm excited because it's been months since I've talked to Tom and he e-mailed me again, telling me not to be a stranger. I have that affect on people, they always feel the need to remind me that, ""you know....we Can be friends....""

I'm awkward, can you tell.

That's an actual quote, actually. The actually actual answer to that actually is I use that word way to often.

I like the shoes that I've picked out for this evening. Tapscott's meeting me in two minutes for Cosi.

The ovens and grills were fired, and the food fully stocked and waiting for no one to come along and eat it up. My last table, of the four I'd had all afternoon, signed for their check and left me a lousy tip. I cleared the wait station and prepared coffee, lemons, half and half, and sliced bread for the incoming shift. 

I got off work early--that happens a lot now. Business is bad in August--and I was walking home past a fake-Thai restaurant where a woman sat alone, an asian woman fattened by America. She had two moles, one beneath each eye, just at the lids, like a tearful mime.

""When the news broke (while I was in college) that an ounce of distilled spirits kills one thousand neurons (I think that was the ratio), my concern over the death of brain cells, being born early in my life (when I was ten), intensified dramatically. I confessed to my mother over the phone that I had been worrying that, over the past six months especially, my brain wattage had dimmed perceptibly...

'It's true,' she said, that your individual brain cells are dying, but the ones that stay and grow more and more connections, and those connections keep branching out over the years, and that's the progress you have to keep in mind. It's the number of links that's important, not the raw number of cells.'

This observation was exceedingly appealing, and from it I formed several related theories:

a) We begin, perhaps, with a breain that is much too crowded with pure processing capacity, and therefore the death of tat precedes the move upward to higher levels of intelligence; the weak ones frizzle out, and the gaps they leave as they are reabsorbed stimulate the growth buds of dentdrites, which now have more capacious playgrounds, and complex correlational structures come about as a result. (Or perhaps the dendrites'own heightened need for space to grow forces a mating struggle: they lock antlers with feebler outrigers in the search fro the informationally rich connections, shortcutting through intermediate territories and causing them to wither and shut down like neighborhoods near a thruway.) With fewer total cells, but more connections between each cell, the quality of your knowledge undergoes a transformation: you begin to have a feeling for situations, people fall into types, your past memories link together. and your life begins to seems, as it hadn't when you were younger, an inevitable thing composed of a million small failures and successes dependently intergrown, as opposed to a bright beadlike row of unaffiliated moments. Mathematicians need all of those spare neurons, and their careers falter when the neurons do, but the rest of us should be thankful for their disappearance, for it makes room for experience. Depending on where on the range you began, you are shifted as your brain ages toward te richer, more mingled pole: mathematicians become historians, historians become philosophers, philosophers become biographers, biographers become college provosts, college provosts become political consultants, and political consultants run for office.

b) Used with care, substances that harm neural tissue, such as alcohol, can aid intelligence: you corrode the chromium, giggly, crossword puzzle--solving parts of your ming with pain and poison, forcing the neurons to take responsibility for themselves and those around them, toughening themselves against the accelerated wear of these artificial solvents. After a night of poison, your brain wakes up in themorning saying, 'No I don't give a shit who introduced the sweet potato into North America.' The damage that you have inflicted heals over, and the scarred places left behind have unusual surface areas, roughnesses enough to become the nodes around which wisdom weaves its fibrils.

c) The neurons that do expire are the ones that made imitation possible. When you are capable of skillful imitation, the sweep of choices before ou is too large; but when your brain loses its spare capacity, and along with it some agility, some joy in winging it, and the ambition to do things that don't suit it, then you finally have to settle down to do well the few things that your brain really can do well--the rest no longer seems pressing and distracting, because it is now permanently out of reach. The feeling that you are stupider than you were is what finally interests you in the really complex subjects of life: in change, in experience, in the ways other people have adjusted to disappointment and narrowed ability. You realize that you are no prodigy, your shoulders relax, and you begin to look around you, seeing local color unrivaled by blue glows of algebra and abstraction."

It's another night alone here in my sister's appartment with the dog. It went nutso today. There was a period of ten minutes during which it was spooked by god-knows-what that i couldn't get it to stop sprinting about the appartment. ""Cookies"" are supposed to solve everything. And if they don't, singing about cookies and offering cookies at the same time is supposed to be the key. No such luck. I don't know what got into her, but she was psycho. Crazed. A beast.

Do you remember Drew Mullen in those days when he would call anyone outside the social norm, ""a beast.""

""God, man. He's such a beast."" 
""Mrs. Singer's such a fucking beast.""
""Hahaunh. Man that fat kid...what a beast!""

Or was it Peter what's-his-name, of the bi-anual changes...Peter....HOROS. Ah yes, he was a fan of ""the beast"" too. Or Breece Gahl. OMG.

Everything's quiet except for the occasional passers-by on the street below. And when their conversations drift up through the living room window, Cinnamon the dog perks up her ears and jumps up onto the window ledge to check it out.

My mouth tastes sour and I need a hot shower to sterlize myself. I don't know when it happened, but I've become OCD on cleanliness, but only about certain things. I don't like my skin to feel like anything is touching it, other than clothing that is. I wash my hands more times than the number of dishes I rinse before placing them in the dishwasher. And still there's doghair all over me. I feel contaminated. 

Sarah suggested the other night that if I'm lonely, I should just bring the dog over to the appartment and hang out with her there. I would, but then my home. My appartment, My beautiful clean room and living room and kitchen and floors would be contaminated by The Dog. I told her no.

I'm not really a waitress. That was the name of my mother's favorite bright red nail polish for a long time. Before she became more subdued. (Now she wears a more subtle Burgundy or blood-red.) But I'm not really a waitress. That's what I meant. For real, for shizzle. I'm not. I hate to admit it, it sounds pathetic and annoying and WASPesh, but I don't like to serve. Not that I want to always be the one served. But I like voluntarily serving. I like to do favors. I like giving. I don't like being ordered around. I don't like being a go-to girl. And I'm terrified I'll end up that way. But is that what every job is like? While you're a student or you're a child and following your parents instructions, the rules and guidelines set out for you are really only measures for your own safety, security, and potential future prosperity. It's only after you become independent that the bars come down. You're not flying free anymore, with the support beneath you from a parental or professorial wing. You have to provide for yourself and so you serve. You take a job, an internship, and fill coffee mugs for your superiors. You take orders, do mundane tasks as the education for which you worked so hard and paid so much slips away from you. You waste away your years, your memory, on a life of commands, repetitive tasks. You sit in your office and day after day earn your dollars. But the discovery's done. The entertainment's disappeared. You have to pay 9.50 anywhere you go now to have the movie theaters entertain your curiosity about other people's supposedly more-interesting lives. But really, they're just telling stories. The movies, the actors. They're just telling make-believe stories. What's fulfilling? Discovering something new.

I'm bored. It's been a long time since I've discovered anything. I need to do more of that. Exploration is all that my time is really worth. And there ain't much to explore in the kitchen of a restaurant. Sedentary. Stationary. The former sounds like that silt crap at the bottom of the nile. The second sounds like formal paper one needs to write her RSVP:

Dear Ms. Tracy Foote,

I regret that I cannot make the debutant reunion luncheon of the 21st of August. Although I was delighted to receive your kind invitation, I will be out of town on a brief vacation....

Which isn't true, but nevertheless it is always nice to sound as though you desperately wish you could do something but unhappily must concede to forgo a pleasant opportunity for a legitimate cause/reason of absolute necessity.

It was only after I decided upon this reply to Ms. Foote that I began research on a trip to Kauai from August 25 - September 7. I found a package deal for flight+hotel that will cost me 1,000 dollars. Anyone fancy going along with me? I can harldy say that I'm serious about spending the dough, or that my parents would ever let me pack up and leave on such short notice. But I could use a getaway, right now my ambition is on stand-still and I can't seem to propell it forward and back into life. I'm sunken, like the ships at Pearl Harbor.

And so it goes,
And so it goes.
And you're the only one who knows.

Another beautiful song that I know I downloaded once but can't seem to find on my Windows Media Player for the life of me.

Oh yes, and I wish I were working at Borders or Barnes and Noble,
despite my earlier rant about work=suckage. I really would like cash so I could treat myself to an unrealistic vacation package daydream once again....maybe tomorrow."

"event","So, I'm babysitting my sister's dog. I came over last night and we had dinner together, and I slept over here, because they were planning to leave early the next morning. Only problem with this whole set-up was that I had a test in Italian class the next day. And though I told Liz this, she could not refrain from being completely obnoxious and repetitive all night long in her instructions on how to properly care for her precious fucking puppy, who's so annoying most the time I almost think it's as annoying as she was last night.

Well, I guess Cinnamon...that's the dog...isn't so bad. She's really quiet and calm when you're just doing the day to day thing. It's when visitors come over, or there's more than one person in the house that she gets overwhelmed and suddenly starts opting for attention. It's really very annoying when that's the case, so I didn't give her the warmest of sisterly affections last night. The dog I mean. I sort of snubbed her. But Jesus, I was studying and Liz kept coming in trying to teach me how to deal with the dog when she isn't doing what she's told to do. So here I am desperately staring down at my list of vocab trying to conjugate irregular verbs and being attacked by an overly exuberant dog while being nagged at by my sister, saying: 

""All she wants is cookies and attention, and you control both those things, so she's really quite simple. She'll do whatever you want as long as she knows you can give her cookies and attention. And she wants cookies more than attention, and if she doesn't get cookies she'll want attention...and cookies if she wants...can give her attentions...cookies, if you find...attention...give cookies...and attentiona nd cookies and attentiona and cookies and and and and...................""

OMG she has a knack for being fucking repetitive.

And to top it all off, I'm so tired I could collapse, but I can't take naps. I just don't know how to do it. I can't sleep during the day, and I didn't get any sleep last night. And granted I did well on my test today, it was still annoying as all hell when my sister came into my room at seven in the morning, after I'd already been up studying for an hour, to recap what she'd said last night.

She brought me a bunch of the dog biscuits and put them in my palm like it was some kind of 7am gift club/society that I was privileged to be joining and said something to the effect of, ""Now you have the power."" 

I almost died. UGH! So that's my rant. And I'm currently covered in licks and hair and though I've washed my hands and changed my shirt, I still feel the presence of more licks and more hair, and I can smell the dog on me everywhere.

I loved Coco.

I'm never getting a dog."

"event","I like to clean, and have all of my things around me clean. I like to have everything off the countertops and tucked away in careful stacks in their little cupboards and drawers. I like file cabinets and baskets to keep record of my writings from the past years. I like it when all the dust disappears and the grime is wiped away. And when the blinds are up, after I've washed the windows down with windex, I like the way the sun sits in the haze above the treetops away in the distance and spreads out to the city roof tops and up, closer, stretching through my windows and across the wooden floors to the hem of the carpet, to the curve of the design, to the heel of the couch, to the steel of the drawer handles in the kitchen and the two lonely magnets on the refrigerator (that incidentally are neatly alligned.) I like it. I like it all. And I sit at the farthest reach from that light, against the wall, close to the door. Up against the door, practically, so that if by chance someone came home to interupt the quiet that is the sunlight in this appartment and opened the door, I might be swept out by the slightest ambitious push of that sun to spread further.

The other day, I left the quiet before I noticed it was so, and bought myself two stems of fresh Lilies. I put them in a vase at the dining table, and each day each bulb opens wider. And I like to sit at that table and do my work when I'm alone. Smell the lilies and do some work when I'm alone, so that I don't notice. It occured to me a moment ago to turn on music. A day ago I turned on music. And the light touch of the piano synthesized and tiptoed across the floor, and dipped in the bedrooms and bathrooms and kitchen and den, and sat upon the bend of my knee. A very feeble, vulnerable place is the bend of your knee. Apply the slightest pleasure and it plummets, especially caught unawares. And the music fell lightly everywhere but on my knee, where down it came and I felt tired again. And my lilies make me dreamy, like I was once when that was all I knew how to do. Dream.

It's a dangerous thing to be told to do. Dream. You learn to imagine and make believe, explore your own mind, but no one ever tells the children to be careful--not to get caught there. It's a web, intricate, and if you step back it's beautiful--like a spider's--but if you don't step back, you get caught. And in the mouth of the spider, it's harder to accept your fate than if you never explored the web in the first place.

The house at 1220 was filled with webs when we moved in. Father swept them away with his wife and built his reality. He revelled and lived and thrived, and now he's taking his step back. And he's weaving his own web after the vision he's gained only by taking that footfall backwards. Tumble or fall, you need that moment, because it's a dangerous thing to get caught in a dream. Because what if you never build new ones?

The cobwebs and nests and grime and dust filtered back, crept back over the years, and we adhered to their rules, however we may think we kept them away. They lived with the family at 1220. Just as they lived with my grandfather in Amelia. He didn't get out soon enough. It's a dangerous thing, but beautiful. He died in the dream that he never let go, and I see how it's dangerous. We're all letting that go now, and soon I'll be stepping back from 1220 too. And every day that transition spreads forward to my window. The only window I see.

I don't like dark alleys. I don't like get away escapes, and I've been made to take them. And I've taken more, and more as the years pass, I slip out the back, I'm swept out the door. Because I didn't concede first. I didn't make the decision, but allowed someone else to make the nudge. Out the door out the door out the door out the door.

I like the new appartment. Sometimes, when I'm alone, and I'm tired of doing my work to keep from feeling the sunlight and the lilies and the music, I clean, to make myself feel better. 

But sometimes, I wait for the cobwebs."

"event","I wrote this message to Tess with my last move on www.itsyourturn.com in the middle of a game of battleship. Is it lame that I find it easiest to pinpoint what's bothering me when I'm writing, rather than when I talk on the phone or face to face with a person? When I speak, things just seem so trivial, ut when I get caught up in my words, in my head, all these issues, these worries just fall out over top of each other onto the page, and I can't control them all. They're everywhere. So I always have to excuse myself to Tess when she writes back things like: (and I predict): ""Woman, you need to calm the f*** down and call me. That was a novel.""

o mia bella cara. why is it so crazy hard for me to make friends like the ones i had at home. i don't feel close to anyone here. and as much as i'm excited about my roommates, sometimes i feel like they're not as excited about me. i feel really comfortable around annalisa, but i still feel kind of awkward around sarah, and i know it takes time, but it's been a year and the friends i made at the transfer dorm i don't particularly care to keep in touch with, because they're all on their own agendas... and i just feel like that's how college relationships are. people looking for temporary amusement. like they don't think of keeping you long term and so they can't be bothered by working out kinks in relationships and paying attention and special consideration to the needs of others. i feel like no one's looking out for me, though i know i shouldn't rely on that anyway. but dear god, what's happened to compassion and people looking for other people? sarah's so involved with her work (bio and MCATs) that she doesn't mind only having really two or three friends on campus, because that way she has just enough time when she's free to spend on that small amount of friends, and annalisa has a very serious boyfriend, and she doesn't mind that her only extra time goes to a few as well. i've got multitudes of time, and few to no attachments to occupy me otherwise, so i notice very very much how alone i feel sometimes. and it's killer, because tonight, a couple of sarah's friends are coming over to spend the nite, annalisa and her boyfriend might be hanging out too, and all i can think of is whether or not i should catch a ride home with my mom while she passes through evanston on her way home from a day in chicago, so that i can avoid being social and showing myself as the one person there who really doesn't have a strong relationship with anyone else in the room. no inside jokes, no connections, and no deep investment anywhere. what do i do?!! i know the number one best thing to do would be to stick it out, force myself to be social so that way these relationships i stress over so much can improve, and i can build stronger ties to real people, but part of me really just wants to hide. go home, eagerly await the arrival of my sister Millie from Boston tomorrow morning, and mope about only really having family to rely on / fall back on...

long story short. i'm stressed, and i love you. and i wish i had more people like you around right now to give me a hug."

"event","So, visited Caroline. Just got back. Flight lost my bag, so don't have keys to my own apartment, so can't leave unless I want to get locked out of my apartment until the new roomies get back, so in bed. Not sleeping, because I can't seem to sleep in my new apartment, and checking away messages that haven't changed since 6am this morning, (shocker, no one's awake, dummy). I guess I could watch a movie, read a book, or something, to keep me busy. I've organized my room as well as I can without a desk or a bureau or bookshelves, and I can't start on summer reading until I go to Borders and buy my books, which I can't do unless I want to get locked out of my home, as I've said before. So I'm going to sum up the fantasticness that was this past week and then resort to option A: Movie. Maybe that will help me fall asleep too.

  When I arrived in LAX, Caroline was there waiting for me. Only she was hiding, behind a pole, tee hee, so that she could jump out and surprise me. Only it didn't work because I saw her before she saw me. Thought that was funny...

  Moving on! Then, after kisses and hugs, I got into her new, or what I know as new, (it's the first time I've seen it), Ford Mustang convertible...Red...mmm delicious. She handed me directions on a sheet of notepad paper that detailed her trip from home-->LAX, from LAX--> a popular celebrity hotspot for shopping --> Rodeo Drive shopping --> dinner at an Indian Restaurant called ""Gaylord's"" to --> home. I love it. She planned out the whole day. With reservations for dinner. The whole day was superb really: sunny, spent lots of money, we also had all-you-can-eat Sushi for lunch, and when we got home, I toured her new house in Villa Park. I have to say, the fam does have a lovely abode. I told her dad many times that trip that he may be in danger of my moving in. We probably watched a movie that night. When in doubt, if I can't remember what we did at a certain point on this trip, we were probably watching a movie. :) Which is what I really do best. Caroline's working on it. She never used to be a big movie person, but now she's starting to be, only occasionally I'd find her sleeping at the end of one, or we'd finish a film at ten or eleven, and she'd be sleepy aleady. Hehehe. Anyhoo.

  The next day, we were going to go to the beach, but it was cold and overcast, so we went shopping again instead. I desperately wanted to bring home accessories from this trip: earrings, bracelets, necklaces. Fun accessories, lots. But we found none. Caroline lucked out with a few purchases, but I found nothing to suit. Still amazing day. I think that was the night that we came home and made Mexican for dinner for the family. Caroline and I grocery shopped, and then did beef burritos, guac, and margaritas with fresh raspberries in the second batch. Then, we...watched a movie? I don't know.

  So that's how it went, if it was cloudy we shopped, if it was sunny we tanned on the beach. Actually there was only one beach day. Monday, it was sunny, and we took the convertible to newport beach- a lot of the vacation was spent in Cici's car, belting our hearts out to Rent, Moulin Rouge, U2, Billy Joel...haha, countless others. We spent a lot of time in the car- and when we got there and set up our towels and looked out to the water, there were these two guys out on the water. They were wind-sailing, and it was the coolest thing I think I've ever seen. I really want to learn how to do that. Occasionally, they'd go over a wave and fly up several feet in the air and travel several yards before the wind let them back down to the water. It was incredible. I want to do it. Someone teach me please?

  And one night Mr. and Mrs. Hendrix, Cap and Shar, took us out to this swanky beautiful restaurant on the coast that served an amazing Halibut special. I tell ya. It was superb. One day, when we had intended on spending a day in the sun on the beach, by the time we drove to the coast, the clouds had covered the sky, so we checked into a movie for the afternoon. We saw Mr. And Mrs. Smith with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Very hot, very sexy. Loved it, go see it. I want her body, and I want him. And those stunt action scenes...so cool. 

  Other things...I got to meet Cici's friends from Camp James for dinner one night. Saturday I think? Sunday, I don't know. And they were so fun. I really had an awesome time meeting them. They were really funny. Only, I don't know any of their real names, because at Camp James, they all go by nicknames like Jazz, Spunky, Spanky, and Doc. (I think one out of those four is actually someone's name, but you get the pic).

  Oh yes, and how could I forget. One day, when it was cloudy, we decided to be outdoorsy and get off our asses and go hiking. Yes we're so sporty. And we drove to this hiking site, parked, and got out of the car to read a sign posted right at the entrance to the trail...and I quote: 
""WARNING: MOUNTAIN LION COUNTY: A RISK: Mountain Lions may be present and are unpredicatble. Be cautious. They have been known to attack without warning. Your safety cannot be guaranteed. You are advised to stay alert to potential dangers. Please report all mountain lion sightings to the park office."" That is, if you live to tell the tale...
We were a little put off by this to say the least, but we braved it. Oh yes. And not only that, but we thought our hike would be a little two mile excursion around the perimeter of a lakefill, and instead an hour down the road, we looked back over the top of the ridge of mountains we'd just climbed, as if we were starring in that last scene from the sound of music. We saw how far we'd come and were curious if we should turn back or not, but we trudged on. It was glorious, we felt so accomplished when we got back to the car. It probably ended up being close to four miles. Good for us. Really, very good. Pat back. 

And all that while we talked about our futures and where we thought we were going and where we wanted to go, and an idea has started to solidify in my mind now that I might want to try and get an internship next year at a publishing company. I'd love to live in New York with a publishing co. and read new author's work and see what's out there while I audition and write on my own too. That would be lovely. Or maybe it would just be fun to see how the business works, whether I end up doing it or not. Just something Caroline and I discussed, but I have to say I am intrigued....

  So all in all those were the events of the trip, but the best times were really spent in convo with Cici, in the car or otherwise at dinner or when we just had downtime. I've missed her so desperately, and it's so nice being with someone again who's just so easy. So easy to live with, to do nothing with or to do lots with. To laugh and reminisce with. It was great. And we spent a lot of time in convo talking about where we think people we used to know from High School might be now, or where they might be several years down the road. We played games of who had the best ________ and so on. It's just fun thinking back and laughing at what we thought was so important, and seeing how our lives have changed, to accomodate the traditions and habits of our past and force us to outgrow those too. Caroline is so much of my past. But she's so much of my future too.

  So thanks for a great vacation, Cici. It was the breath of fresh air I needed."

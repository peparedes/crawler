especially considering my normal cynicism.

uh oh.  now i'm really scaring myself.  moving on, today was pretty fun.  we drove down here starting about ten, it didn't take that long, only four hours or so including all the time spent in traffic and driving around in circles haha.  so then moving in took forever, but we only made one trip, and them we unpacked really fast and messily, and then i realized i needed an extension cord type thing, and we ran to circuit city, and i ran back, and i had only been offline for like a day, so it wasn't a major crisis.  i met all my roomates, one of them had been in my orientation session, so i sorta knew her already.  so yeah.  i like the dorm and everything.  it feels very nice and homey, which will prolly change drastically once we all get to know each other and start the bickering and cat fights.  yeah, the only bad thing is that i have to walk through my suitemates room to get out, or to get to the fridge/microwave.. and if they're all hardcore fighting, i want to be as far away as possible, not walking through the madness, you know?  i thin ki'd rather have people intrude on me all the time, rather than have to intrude on them.  but yeah, it has a nice view, its pretty nice looking, im happy with it.

my dad is coming tomorrow morning, i'm not going to have anything interesting to show/tell him.  oh well.  i hope he doesn' thtink i'm an interesting person now, or surely he will be disappointed.

hey molly, are you still up for shit tonight?  and have you talked to christina? 

holy shit guys.  i really am leaving forever day after tomorrow.  i have like nothing packed, and i've been packing all week.  i'm just going to show up at the dorm with all these boxes of crap and brothers.. i don't know.  stand around for hours and hours and wait for an elevator.  

today i am actually buying a cell phone.  hopefully a flip one, because i think those are sexy or something, and if ihave to have a cell phone, i at least want a sexy one.  oh and last night i had this nightmare that my earring somehow ripped through my ear, and then my ear healed so that if i didn' tmove my head too quickly, it would stay in the hole, but if i moved too violently, it owuld come out through the rip... yeah.  sometimes i have bizarre dreams."

and then the vineyard was fun, only the beach got hot and i really felt like i was about to pass out.  no one gave a damn though and we stayed till three anyhow, because im just the whiny pale girl :)

afterwards we all showered, and i hurt my ear a lot, and then me and rach and tra walked downtown past the gingerbread houses, of which travis had considerable scorn and fear.  perhaps for which. before i changed my mind that he was afraid of them and added ""scorn"", ""of"" made sense.  ok??  so anyways.  we went to the merry go round thing, and it was fun, only one time i missed the ring and felt dumb lol.  and rach would have gotten the bronze one, but she missed!  and it was sad!  and tra would have gotten it but some doofy little kid was behind him.  next we went and played a game of ddr, and i failed paranoia and felt really stupid, but the place wasn't air conditioned and i was so tired.  haha.  can't be up for more than eight hours befor ei get exhausted and all.  and then we got ice cream, or i got a root beer float, and travis got some coffee cum chocolate thing, and rach got ice cream.  and then we shopped randomly, and it was time to leave.

the ferry ride home was uneventful.  i read my book.  its getting pretty good.  travis was bored the whole time.  there were two drunk fat girls being really loud and drunk.  and the drive home, i was victorious over this asshole car that kept going slow but speeding up (to like 85-90) every time someone tried to pass him.  and i saw an awesome lightning bolt.  craziness.

and i didn't even mention all the card games we played, but we played a lot, and travis was asshole a lot.  i also was asshole a decent amount.  but at least i was vice president more!"

for another two weeks, oh well.  and then im going to college.  where i can learn the true meaning of loneliness.  

im guessing that loneliness is having no tv, no ddr, and no brothers.  not to mention no cats.  i am starving.  dinner was a joke tonight.  it was chicken in really sweet tomato sauce.  i want to eat everything in the house in my state of sadness.  haha.  i need a good book to read.  maybe i will go digging in joe's room.  he only reads fantasy, but i can stand fantasy, some of it is quite good.

my uncle grabbed a'holt (sorry i had to spell it that way) of my earring today and said, i have a tie bar just like this!  and i said, why thank you for yanking that hunk of metal in my ear.  just kidding, i just sort of smiled lamely.  i felt all out of place and intruding on people's sadness-y.

oh yes, i should mention that i went to my aunt's dad's funeral today.  we were late, my uncle gives awful directions.  i knew no one there besides my uncle, his wife, and their two kids.  i had never met the guy who died.  it kind of stunk."

and right now im feeling a little tired.  im sort of bored with livejournal today.. and usually it thrills me.  that's sad.  or maybe it means im returning to the real world.  i doubt it though.  im probably just tired.  yup.

this is one dumb entry.  like all my entries.  i bet they'd be way cooler if i didn't say how dumb they/i are/am constantly."

and now im bored, because no one is online.  i lead an exciting life, what can i say.  if i were more awake/if stores stayed open later, i would go buy a book.  because im really sick of don quixote and i could be reading right now."

know what i hate?  neck zits.  god.  my neck has been all over being a zit farm this summer/spring.. and it never was before.  really disappointing.  almost like figuring out that zits do not go away once you pass through puberty.  because that definitely happened around, oh, fifth grade.. and i still have acne.  i mean, i know this is because my life sucks hardcore any way you look at it.. but still.  fucking neck zits.  and chest zits.  and face zits.  my back acne seems to be clearing up however.. hahaha.  i should figure out how to do lj cut right now cuz fucking no one wants to read that.

and if that worked, and you are suspicious, someone told me how to do that.  i couldn't even fuckng find it on faqs.  i still can't find it.  what is wrong with me lol.  ok well, i am wondering how this is gonna work, so this entry is done.  even though i didn't even get to the meat of what i wanted to talk about.  which was nothing really in the long run.  think about it."

so i just signed up to be a tutor under america reads next year.. which will be fun.. if i can fit six hours into my schedule.  of course i have already looked at my schedule.. but im not sure how things will work out with whoever i get placed with.. and im not sure how far iwill be travelling.. but lets face it, tutoring is fun.  so is working a guaranteed 6-20 hour workweek.  haha.  slacker.

so last night sucked.  haha.  the worst part would have to be trying to play games at pogo.com and failing miserably.. i hate sucking at online games.. *tears*  oops i mean, no tears, im done with that shit.  but anyways, i admire rach greatly for understanding how to operate that site.. the only games i could figure out how to get into were the most popular ones cuz tere is a sign that is large that says ""most popular"" or something along those lines.  yup.

does everyone hate those new popups not quite as much as the old because at least they just pop up instead of taking four minutes to load and freeze your computer?  (hurrah for the girl dreaming of being an english major... uhm)  oh!  im not sure if i already wrote about this, as my brain turned to mush long ago.. but i talked to a nice boy who is staying at brittany next year.  it was cool.  hes a dance major.  i can be all, oh yeah watch this and break out with some mansfield guard skipping in a circle, and he can wet himself laughing at me.  and that will cement a friendship to last through the ages.  hahahaha.  im done."

so.. i don't do enough surveys.  and that one had few really dumb questions.. so it was cool.  right now i am sitting online considering how much my ear is bugging me.. and not wanting to touch the damn thing to clean it lol.  thats horrible.. but oh well.  its not what is going to happen.. its just my immature half longing of the moment.  i always forget why i need to stay home by myself all day.  but this is why:  when i go out a lot.. i can't fucking stand being at home.  oh well.. tomorrow i am out of hte house.. yay painting i guess.  i wish i had more motivation.  but really.  what do i need to accomplish lol.  the most i could do right now would be to clean my room.  and who cares?  i am moving in a month.  its not worth it for a month.  getting a job.. that might be worth it for a month.  i think i will try my luck at stop and shop.. i can work with molly and christina and maybe ellen hahaha.  but that requires either lying or careful truth telling (lol) an dyeah.  i already feel guilty all the time.  but i mean.. its just an employer.  a big nameless employer too.  so who cares.  sigh.  

i have too much time on my hands.. no doubt.  you can tell because all i do is update my livejournal like every five minutes haha.  oh yeah.. does anyone know if they limit your posts per day?  i couldn't remember and i don't feel like just updating a ton to check lol.  yeah.  and i need a new game besides neopets.  it no longer entertains me for more than five minutes.  and ddr is not that fun because im still not used to the earring, and believ eit or not, it sort of hurts to jump up and down a lot.  but yeah.  boo to less than obsessive ddr playing.  big boo.  

guess what else deserves a boo?  serkan being in fucking north carolina.. and his internet service beingless than good.. and me being a retard on the phone.  haha.  it just makes communication.. mildly more difficult than i can stand.  actually.  i think i deserve a boo for caring so damn much about this.  its so fucking dumb.  i knew it was going to happen.  and i still didn't try that hard to stop it lol.  such a fucking idiot.  or maybe.. this was a good choice.  im not really sure.

hopefully no one read that waste of a paragraph.. because it was a waste of a paragraph.  haha.  this will prolly be also.  but at least it won't be a whiny sad waste.  it will be a whiny minorly annoyed waste!  i hate how on accuradio the most played band must be the mouldy peaches.  although xtina maintains that wheres the coke is a good song.. they are too much for me to handle.  i remember like a year ago when tara told me to dl them cuz i would like them.. and then i did and really killed myself.  only obviously, i did not kill myself.  i am just making shit up.  oh yeah.  and it just occurred to me that maybe i should go check my nyu mail and see if i got job offers lol.  yay looking for a job at nyu in july.  uhm.. right.  i think tonight i will get off the damn computer and.. watch tv?  lol.  yeah my life is awesome."

"event","so today i went with molly, christina, and jill to get my industrial done.  we waited for like fifty billion hours.. or just one.. for jamie to come back.  and i was so nervous lol.  i felt like i was honestly going to barf on him as soon as he came at me with a needle.  but anyways.  turns out i have small freak ears.. and i've always thought they were a bit on the big side.  just because joe and will have even smaller freak ears lol.  so finding the right size earring was hard.  but he found one eventually.  and at first i thought it was too vertical, but then when he drew it on my ear it looked nice.. and it looks nice now.  

i made some terrible faces when he was piercing me.  and at one point he pulled out some pliers.. and that really freaked me out.  cuz i had one hole done already.. and yeah just pliers near my ear?  oh man.  twas scary.  but it was just to unscrew the ball or something.  the second hole bled a fair amount.  it didn't hurt that much more though.  it took like a millisecond longer to push through all the way.. and that suspense was seriously painful to my psyche if nothing else.  but anyways.  when it was done it was beautiful if swollen.. and by the time i got back to mansfield it was pretty much back to normal size and color.  theres a bit of dried blood still.. i think im quite the bleeder lol.. but it doesnt hurt too bad.  and i'll just take some tylenol so it will stay not swollen.  yup.  i thought it would be way worse than it actually was.. so that is very reassuring.  now if it doesn't get infected that would be splendid.

i really don't want to touch this thing to clean it.. but i know it has to be done.  although it seems like it will hurt to touch.. when jamie moved it around my ear it didn't really feel like much.  probably i will be ok.  heh.

so that is my really long non-making sense entry about my ear.  thanks to anyone who read it lol.

and i think i need a lot more sleep.. and a lot less talking to people/writing things in my journal when im tired and making no sense."

that requires putting on a bra, which i've decided is the bare minimum for primping.  maybe i'll wash my face too and ask for a job application wherever i go.. hahahaha.  now that, my friends, is professionalism.

i feel like today is going to be like yesterday.  a day that was sad and lonely all day and then was happy and then i went to bed really aggravated.  that cycle of emotions comes very naturally to me.  because after a day of moping, any little thing will get my hopes up.. and then any little thing makes me go ""wah"".  

serkan poses questions so oddly.. it drives me crazy because if he didn't ask things in a roundabout way, i would understand what he was asking instead of being confused by what his phrasing implies.  im always so into implication.  i will just shit my pants when i realize that sometimes people aren't hinting in discreet ways when they talk to me.

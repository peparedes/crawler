What i'm sure of is that last weekend was fucking amazing... Even though i lost my voice...

<b>Friday Night:</b> I went to Katie's (my cousin >_<) party... Got fucked up, and was able to welcome a new member into our exclusive family that we all know and love...

<b>Saturday</b>: I had to go to West Palm at like fucking 7 AM!! Stupid Debate Competition... What ever... After that though, i met up with Sierra, Mike, Emily, and Nini, and we all went down to Garlic Fest... Holy shit.. It was the Best Time I have had in a while... Real bonding time...

<b>Sunday</b>:I had to work really early... I worked from 8am-3pm.. but w.e... After that I went and hung out with Emily, and Sierra for a while... Then we drove around, ended up at Emily's house... Oh man... Someone suggested we watch her baby videos.. WHAT AN AWESOME IDEA!!! This was after we had fun on the piano... So we watch the videos, and Sierra gets FRUNK... Than  Sierra Mike and Me go to Burger King, where Sierra steals another awesomwe sign...

<b>Monday</b>: Monday was awesome too... It was one of the first times I had ever gone to Renn Fair... So we all got dresseed up and went to Denny's for breakfast... There much have been like 15 people there... And for some reason Denny's was Packed! So we all walk in, in our costumes, and endure everyone staring at us... Which was actually really funny... After that we went to the fair.. So much fun... Oh and the Chocolate Covered Banana's are AMAZING!!! Holy shit...

Moral of the story is I love my friends... Even when they're making fun of the fact that i sounded like all the guys when they were 10 going through puburty... hahah...

Love you guys... 

Especially My ABCDD!!!

Always and Forever.... Meet you in Hell Bitches!"

"event","So this is me.. This is my journal.. Mostly because i'm a lazy sack of shit who is tired of hand writing everything.. And it's easier than talking.. On the count of I talk to much already.. 

So lets see.. It's winter break.. Something i've been looking forward to for the past like MONTH and it's already kinda' gay.. But you know what.. I'm not gonna' let that get me down..

You see I have this new outlook on life where i'm just gonna' try to stop letting things bother me.. Not saying that it's gonna' really work or anything, but it's a start.. All my life i've been pushed and pushed around, and recently like the past year or so (which is kinda' recently, right? w.e) but yea recently i've been pushing back.. It's not fully intentional.. But it's just something I tend to do.. Sheep's right, I don't know my limit, and i'm fully aware that I do what I do and I don't know when or where to stop.. But right now there really isn't anything I can do, or that anyone can do.. And being constantly reminded doesn't really do anything.. 

My whole life I have also tried to be friends with everyone.. And I don't think that there is really anything wrong with that.. I put a lot of people ahead of me, which is whats wrong.. And recently I have been reevaluating that too.. I'm trying to find that happy medium.. And frankly I think that I am 16 years old and shouldn't really have too many cares in the world.. All I should stress about is work, family, friends, and school.. 

I ""write"". I have an over vivid imagination.. Which I have noticed pisses people off.. It's not that i'm lying, it's just scenario's play in my mind and I lose track of telling what actually happened to what I thought of.. So sorry about that everyone.. Haha.. Umm.. I'm not too close with my family.. My dad and I have a very strong relationship, and every-now-and-then so does my mother and me.. But I mean i'm 16 and most teens don't get along with there parents.. My brother and I are close sometimes too.. He works a lot and has a wonderful girlfriend names Audrey who is like a sister to me..

Then there are the friends.. Because I don't get along too much with the family I rely on them a lot.. They are my ""family"".. We call ourselves the family.. We argue like family.. And we all do things as a family.. I love it.. 

I'm satisfied with how my life is.. It could be better.. But has anyone really ever been like, ""Hmm life's good, couldn't get any better... Like nothing to do just stop right here and stop caring..""

So i'm done for now.. My latest poem will be up whenever I remember to put it here..

If you stuck around to read this, thank you. Honestly you must either have:
A) A lot of extra time to kill
-or-
B) Really care (slightly) about what I have to say

PEACE OUT NUKKA FOO!!"

"event","You know what makes me really sad?  School starts tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  August 7th.  That has to be against the law.  My friends in Pittsburgh aren't going back to school until September 9th.  It's just not fair.  I fucking hate my school.  Fuck Weddington.  They're trying to make us wear these dumbass identification badges with our pictures on them.  They have our social security numbers on them too.  Is that even legal?  Anyway, I'm not doing it, and I'm sure as hell no one else is going to.  My school is just so fucking gay.  So today my brother woke me up playing the pink panther on the piano at 8 in the morning.  I did get out of bed til around 9 though.. I couldn't fall back to sleep, the little shit.  So I got up and watched Regis and Kelly and then I did some stuff around the house.  Then I went to the gym to give Keiley her tape.  I had on jeans and one of those tee shirts from Abercrombie and Kevin asked me if I was there to tumble.  Yeah, ok, Kevin.  So then I went over to South Park and picked up my new glasses and then I went to the mall to find an outfit for tomorrow.  I found a really cute outfit at Abercrombie but I needed more cash so I asked the lady to put it on hold for me for 5 minutes and she wouldnt do it.  Why the hell can't they put clothes on hold for five minutes?  Is that part of their little thing to be snotty to their customers?  I just don't get that.  If I didnt think the clothes were so cute I wouldn't shop there.  But I just love the stuff.  Oh well.  So then I came home and went outside and just hung out for a bit.  I have to take a shower and straighten my hair tonight.. don't know when I'll get around to that.  Blaaaaaaaaaaaah schoooooooool- pray for me. :("

"event","So my lovely younger brother decided it would be fun to wake me up today.  He came into my room yelling and screaming and stealing $40 from me.  The little asshole.  I got it back from him but of course I banged my bad knee on the side of my bed.  The thing hurt like a bitch.  Anyway, yesterday I went to the mall with Keiley to buy outfits for her ""surprise"" birthday party and then we went and saw the new Austin Powers movie.  I saw a shirt that I wanted from the Limited but I didn't have enough money yesterday so today I went back over to south park and got it.  Keiley's party is tomorrow and since I'm getting her the Real World you didn't see or whatever and it's not gonna be in for like another week, I had to get her something else.  Everytime we go to the mall and stop by MAC she always tells me about how her friend stole her lipglass (yes, lipglass, that's what they call it at MAC so don't think i'm crazy.. whatever.) and it was her favorite and blah blah blah.. so anyway, I got her a thing of it.  Then on the way home I decided I was hungry so I stopped and got some chinese food.  When I got home I ate and watched Hardball.  Keanu Reeves is sooo hot.  I always forget that until I see him in a movie.  Anyhoo, the movie was pretty good.  Then I went on the computer for a bit cause there was nothing to do.  Nobody was home and my mom had the car 'cause she had taken my little brother to the pool.  Around 8 I went outside cause the guys had gotten back from the skate park and we just chilled til about a half hour ago.  So then I went inside and watched the best of tom green.. it was on mtv.  I hadn't seen tom green in a looong time.  He's just a dumbass.  So yeah, that's what went on today.  Exciting, isn't it?  .....later."

"event","Hola.  I haven't written for a while.  I'm a lazy person.  Sue me.  We went down to Isle of Palms for the fourth.  My aunt, uncle, and cousins were down there from Pittsburgh on vacation.  We were only there for a day but we watched fireworks on the beach.  It was cool.  I don't remember doing anything on Saturday or Sunday so nothing important must've happened.  On Monday I was at the gym all day.  I had practice and then I had to work and it just sucks when you're there all day.  Lindholm asked me out on a date and I said I'd go to dinner with him.  I don't really like him ""that way"" but he's fun to hang out with.  Today I had tow work and then ""Brittnee"" and I went to one of those Japanese places where they cook right in front of you.  Man, that was good.  Then we went to Starbuck's and I got a White Chocolate Mocha thingy.  Caffinee seems to have no effect on me because I didn't get hyper at all.  Or maybe I'm just that tired from working.  I dunno.  So, this isn't as long as my other entries but I'm being really lazy and I don't feel like going into detail.  Deal with it.  Peace out."

"event","Aside from getting up at 6:30 this morning, today started out alright.  I was still pissed at my mom for how she was acting yesterday but I decided not to worry about it and just go to cheerleading.  We tumbled.  We stunted.  We did this awesome sequence though.  It was a great sequence to begin with, but it what made it awesome was that Kevin said that we could never do it.  It's full in heelstretch, rewind- with the flyer still in the heelstretch, full in- still holding the stretch- back up to arabesque or something.  It was great.  So then I went to the store to buy Mike a birthday card since it's his birthday today.  All of the cards sucked but there was one that had a pin in it and it said ""I've survived damn near everything.""  It's shitty but it fits him because he's had at least two ""near death experiences,"" as he likes to call them.  What sucks is that I didn't even get to see him today but, oh well.  I'll see him another day.  So later on I had to run a few errands and as I was driving from blockbuster to get on 485 this black suv (i dont remember what it was, exactly) pulls up beside me and guys are yellin at me.  They're asking me questions about where I go to school and shit.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to put my hair up.  So I'm driving down the road trying to get on the interstate, trying to put up my hair (so I'm not holding on the wheel) and I'm trying to talk to these guys.  Yeah, I'm smart like that.  So, I go to Brittnee's house and we hung out for like an hour before work.  It was fun.  We watched the X-Files.  Then we went to work and these brats told their parents that Brittnee and I were being rude to them and that we made her feel like she couldn't do something that we thought she should be able to do.  First of all, that's total shit.  Second, all we were asking her to do was jump back.  She couldn't do it.  If you're a fucking retard and you can't fucking jump backward, you've got no right to be in the fucking gym.  So then I get home and I go upstairs to turn my computer on and it wont boot up.  What the fuck?  It must've crashed.  I didn't even do anything to it.  Piece of shit, that was supposed to be a good computer too.  So, I have no idea what's wrong with that thing.  I'm on the old computer now.  And the cable modem isn't working so I'm on the 56K modem.  It's not really that bad tonight but oh well.  I'm still pissed.  Fuck computers."

"event","Today started out great.  I woke up at 12.  That's the latest I've gotten up all damn summer.  So, I did nothing for a little bit and then I went outside and chilled with the guys.  It was really hot out so we went inside Bryce's house for a little bit.  My mom called and told me to come home so I came home and the only thing she does is bitch at my about random shit for 10 minutes.  Then she starts to talk on the phone for a fucking half hour so I decide to go back outside.  She's like ""don't go back in their house"" and I'm like why the hell not?  She says that I dont need to be hanging out with those gross guys and drooling over Mike Ortiz.  What a dumb fuck.  She doesn't know shit and it pisses me off.  So then I decided just to go on the computer for a little bit and bitch about her to some friends (sorry if you were one of them).  Then it started to thunderstorm so I turned off my computer and watched the end of Clueless on my portable DVD player in my room.  Then dinner.  My mom managed to piss me off even more and I already wasn't talking to her.  My dad asked me what I did today and my mom was like ""Nothing, she was feeling sorry for herself because she doesn't have a car and she had nothing to do.   Because we won't get her a car.  She thinks she's responsible.  Like staying out til 1 in the morning is resonsible.  You're so selfish.  It's all about you.  You kept me up because I couldn't go to sleep and I'm the one who had to get up early this morning""  Uh, yeah, ok Mom now who is it all about?  On and on and on and on and she would not shut the fuck up.  Plus, the couldnt be farther from what I was really pissed off about.  What a dumb bitch.  So anyway, after dinner I got online for a couple minutes and then I went outside and played basketball some.  Then I hung out with the guys some.  Lindholm came down with his new car and Mike's present (Mike's birthday is tomorrow).  He got him a bunch of fireworks so we set some off.  One of them didn't go up at all and it blew up right on the ground.  It was so fucking funny and we got it on tape.  A little after that I had to go in because my parents are bitches but oh well.  Another day..."

"event","Hey.  Well, my day started off at 6:40 this morning since I had fucking cheerleading practice 7:30-10.  So, that sucked but oh well.  At least I got to see my buds.  Anyway, after that I basically did nothing for a couple hours.  Then I went outside and hung out with some guys from my neighborhood.  It was hot as hell outside so after a while we went in Bryce's house to chill for a bit.  We watched some TV and then I decided that I wanted to watch the X-Files so I went in Bryce's room to watch it on his TV.  Next thing I know, Mike is falling on top of me.  He rolled off me onto the side and started putting his arms around me and we were spooning.  Now, I was like ""what the fuck"" but it was actually pretty nice, if ya know what I mean.  At 5:30 I left to go pick my friend up and go to work.  I worked 6-8, which was pretty uneventful (I swear to God one of the kids has ADHD).  I went back outside after I came home.  It was Mike, Bryce, Brett and me.  They skated for a little bit while I just watched.  I didn't feel like skating.  Brett had to go at like 9 and then Bryce had to go in around 11.  So then it was just me and Mike.  We just chilled, it was fun.  He was so tired, he said some really funny shit 'cause he didn't know what the hell he was talking about.  He was like ""my sack is connected to my body.""  I was just like what the fuck?  He explained to me that he meant his sack was ""squised"" against his body because he was wearing boxer briefs.  What a wonderful image I conjured up in my mind, hah.  Well, we were just talking and before I knew it, three hours had gone by.  Just like that.  It was awesome.  Tomorrow I don't have a goddamn thing to do all day (except chill and maybe go see a movie) so I can sleep as late as I want.  6:40 my ass. Later."

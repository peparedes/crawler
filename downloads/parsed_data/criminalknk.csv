"event","<font color=""#800080"" size=""2"">So today was the last day of real classes. Tomorrow we start exams. I only have to go in for my first period exam. I am so glad school is over. Next year I will be a senior. WOOT! So today I didnt really do anything. I left my first period teacher to give my second period teacher my book. When I got there she wasnt there but Josh was so we hung out there till she got there. It was only like 5 min. Then when we left there I stoped to talk to my somewhat a teach. Then Josh cought up and we walked to class since they were like right next to eachother. All day we kept seeing eachother so I called him a stalker. HAHA! and we have gym together so I told his sisters that he was stalking me all day. It was funny. Then lunch sarah and I went to sit with Loren and they had cake so we had some of that and then left to take pic's of people. Durring 5th period when the bell rang for 2nd lunch I staied for a while in class then left to go see people at second lunch. I got to see John, Chela, Krista, Coco Crisp, Alex, Eddie, Mark, Erin, Tim, Lauren, and some other people but I cant remember who. When I went over to see Krista, Coco Crisp and Eddie I sawl Michelle (she is in my 5th period) We had to pretty much run back to class to get our stuff because the bell rang and we said we were ""in the bathroom"". At the end of the day I hung out with Alex, Mark, Eddie, Erin, and Chela and listened to Eddie play his guitar. After a while he stoped and Mark started to throw wood at Alex, I was sitting with Alex, and I got hit in the head with a piece of wood. Eddie wanted me to sit with him so I left Alex to sit with Eddie. I wanted to get out of the range of fire. Then I got up and went back to Alex. After a min Eddie came over and sat infront of me. I got to play with his hair. YAY! Then we all got up and left. Eddie and I walked out to our cars and said good bye. All of then are Seniors so I wont see then next year. *Tear*&nbsp;<br />Wow I wrote alot. Well GOOD LUCK SENIORS!!!<br />~Kristen</font>"

First Period-sleep, Second Period-Talk, Third Period-Talk, Fourth Period-basket ball, Fifth Period-Movie, Sixth Period-Movie. I wish I didnt go to school today. Oh well. So most of my friend were not here today because AP Exams. After school I met up with Chela and she asked me if I was going to be staying a while. I was just like ok not thinking that it would be long. I ended up staying an hour after school. again oh well....I got to see&nbsp;some of&nbsp;my senior friends...Alex, Erin, Mark, umm...dont know anyone else. But yeah after chela got done we left and went to Wendys for lunch. When I got home I went in my room and watched TV for a while and then fell asleep for almost an hour and a half. It was crazy. I didnt think I would sleep that much. </font>"

I was only supose to work till 3:00 but then I told vennie that I would work till 3:30 for him and he could leave at 3:00. Sean wouldnt let me leave at 3:30 so I finally got to leave at 4:00 after the evil one (sherri) got there. Durring my break sean called me up on the air phone and asked me to come to the front. He told me to look at corey so I did and I just said ok??? then he told me that he felt like he was going to pass out. He asked me if I could clock in about 10 min. early from my break. He told me that I&nbsp;couldnt tell anyone that we had this conversation and if&nbsp;I got cought he would&nbsp;have my back.&nbsp;I said ok and went back to the break room for 10 min. When I came back up front I looked at him to kinda be like are you sure you want to to clock on and then he just told me that I didnt need to but thanks anyways. So I was like ok and went back to the break room. When my break was over I came back to the front and clocked back on. Sean explained why he didnt need me to come up early and then he just thanked me anyways.</font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#800080"" size=""2"">So I woke up at 6:30 on a weekend just to go to work. YAY! I was dead. I was falling asleep while&nbsp; bagging. The only good thing was the sherri was not there, but also sean wasnt there and I wanted&nbsp;him to teach me&nbsp;how to use the key. Oh well, next time. So then I got off work at like 1ish and then I came home and took a shower. I got online and talked to chela and asked her if she wanted to go for a run on&nbsp;the cause way. yeah dont know if i spelled that right but you get it, right? So we kinda walked most of the time. We did run for a min but the I had to stop because my ankle started to hurt. After we went to on side then we walked down by the water. It was fun. We planed to walk/run after school from now on. Then we left and picked up my brother so we could go get a movie and dinner. We got RENT and Broke Back Mountain. We only watched RENT and that was a great movie. I liked it. I am going to watch Broke Back Mountain tonight by myself because no one else wants to watch it with me. Or I might call someone to come over. But yeah then I took chela home. When I got back home I fell asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />*YAWN* Good night<br />Kristen</font>"

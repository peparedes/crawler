So this week was Luke appreciation week. It was amusing.  Had an I'm with Luke T-shirt friday but it was a little small and I already had two shirts on so I just gave it to kevin.  Speaking of kevin, we went to his house thursday and had a pretty good time.  It was me,kevin, benny, luke, chris and then craig later on.  We played some poker and some basketball (ha) and then beyond balderdash which is pretty much the best board game ever.  

Yesterday Allison and I went to the cabaret and that was pretty cool.  I had a great time even though it wasn't long enough.  There was also the thing where the microphones weren't turned up loud enough but it wasn't that bad on some songs and I enjoyed everything anyway.  When we got back to Allison's house her dad showed up and so I met him and everything.  He's a pretty cool guy and totally brought up the raptors thing from elementary school and that was awesome. Turns out he knows some guy from my work which would be a lot neater if it had been someone I've heard of, but I guess it's some dude that's a lot higher up than me and only works during the week. 

Speaking of work, though, I hate my job.  That being said, it wasn't that bad at all today.  I was calling for North Carolina Wesleyan College today which is pretty much the best campaign in the world to call for, because everybody on it is really agreeable and nice.  On that campaign, you're offering people scholarship money so I talked to a bunch of nice people that just want to go to college.  And the best part is that they all speak English.  I didn't have to screw around with a single person that couldn't understand me and I didn't have anyone get mad and yell at me today, either.  It was pretty cool. 

I'm going to my aunt and uncle's house tomorrow for the big family dinner (which is actually lunch over there) for mother's day and we're eating mexican food and i freaking HATE MEXICAN FOOD. AGHH. Everything's going to have onions in it too.  My relatives would probably even eat onions on ice cream if any of them were creative enough to conjure up the idea. But whatever, I'll be over there with all my big family and they pretty awesome except for their taste in food."

So anyways I called Allison earlier this evening and it turns out she was at youth group and didn't hear my call.  William says they tried to call me back but it was busy.  My mom got on the internet for a while and then I got on, so no one could get through.  Whoops."

"event","I am so fucking mad.. I went in to work today and got there about 1:45 just like I do every Sunday and the parking lot is empty.  There's not a single person there except some truck in the bank parking lot whose owner I never saw.  I let myself into the building (the door has a keypad) and the lights are all off and everything. I don't know if today is some obscure holiday that I don't know about or what, but no one informed me that I wouldn't be working today and there's no fucking excuse for that.  This isn't even the first time someone's had their head up their ass and forgot to call me, two weeks before easter I went in on Saturday to an empty building because nobody decided to let me know that the shift wasn't starting until two hours later. 

Anyways, I left a message on the answering machine for Courtney, the girl who does the schedules and is probably the one responsible for my 50 miles of wasted gas but she'll probably call me back while I'm at school, so I'll just call them again when I get home."

Wednesday is Allison's birthday and she's like maybe having a group of us go bowling or something, she's not sure.  So that'll be fun and then also acquire the fire is next weekend, and kathleen might be going with us now so that would be cool."

"event","Things are going pretty good.  I've been getting nerd medals all over the place lately.. chemathon, Business competion, and academic team.  All those were pretty fun.. more for the hanging out than the competing.  Except a-team.  That just kicked ass.

I called Kevin at about 4:00 because I was home alone and bored out of my mind.  I ended up going over there, and we played a couple games of chess, both of which I loss, watched Field of Dreams, and played poker.  Ben showed up about 15 minutes into the movie. 

Lately it feels like I've been letting my grades slip, but I don't think they actually have much if at all.  I just can't motivate myself to do any homework at home the past couple of weeks, so I've just been madly rushing through everything at school and not doing a great job.  I copied 90% of my history review off of Ben and actually cheated a bit on the test.  I wasn't the only one though so who cares?

I totally can not wait for acquire the fire next weekend.  It's going to be so awesome hanging out with allison and everyone and listening to all that music.  Angela called my house today while I was Kevin's to ask about acquire the fire and to see if I'd gotten her email.  I guess I haven't, because I've still been waiting to hear back for her.  I don't know what time she goes to bed, though, so I'll just wait until tomorrow after work to call her.  

Speaking of things I totally can't wait for, state Science Olympiad is the weekend after ATF.  That's going to be awesome as well.  We're staying in a hotel that friday night and I definately plan to be up to no good.  There far too many opportunities in a hotel, I can't let them all go to waste. 

Sunday night I have off work, and I'm going to go to the kansas city wind symphony concert with some of the band.  I'm going to ride with Allison and i think kathleen, so we'll all have a good time.  

The world would be a better place if everyone were a little more straightforward.  Wondering is a nightmare and what-ifs a trauma."

"event","I went bowling today with kevin and ben and craig.  I was last place in the first game, losing to kevin by 1 and in the game I was second place, losing to kevin by I think six.  It was fun and really cheap.. for some reason it only cost us 3 bucks apiece for 2 games and shoes, instead of the usual 8.  I figure that either it's cheaper on tuesdays or it's cheaper before a certain time (we went right after school). 

Business contest was today.  Hung out with Reese and Kevin and JP all day, it was reasonably fun.  Took home three medals and ate some fast food and all that good stuff."

For those of you keeping score at home, the order is Fudge -> Beef Jerky -> Candy Corn. I got some candy corn with my easter stuff.

Liz is at church right now, and I don't know what time she'll be home so I'm waiting for her to call. 

I have a job interview tomorrow at 3:30.  I'll probably get out of school early tomorrow because it's in Liberty and I don't really know how to get there.  It's the place where Liz works, so I can just get directions from her tonight.  I'm pretty nervous, I've never had an interview before, and I don't really know anything about the company. I really, really want to get this job though.  My parents have been riding my ass for a long time to get a job, and I really want one too, being broke all the time sucks really bad.  I'm not really looking forward to driving to liberty to work on a regular basis, but I'll take whatever I can get.  Money = good.  Gotta have money.  

Anyways, life has been treating me pretty good lately, I can't really complain.  I've got a great girlfriend, awesome friends, and a good future.  I seriously can't wait to get out of highschool and into college.  College has been on my mind like all the time lately.  I want to to to the California Institute of Technology or University of California - Berkely for their astronomy programs.  Both of them are really selective on who they let in, though, and even though I have a good ACT score it's below both of their averages so I'm a little worried.  If I don't get into one of those two schools, my backups are Truman and UM-Rolla here in Missouri.  I'd just take a 4 year physics degree and transfer to a graduate school on the west coast later, and I might end up having to stay in-state anyways because my parents can't afford to pay much money for college, so it depends on how much scholarship money I get and that kind of thing. 

Anyways, I'm going to get off and talk to Rachel, she just signed on a bit ago and I bet she's pretty upset."

But anyways, I had a good weekend.  Saturday I just did the lazy thing until Liz called from districts, so I met her at the school when they got back.  I saw her neon for the first time then, it's pretty nice.  Sunday after church I went to Liz's house and we watched a movie in her living room (Princess Bride.. it's a fairly godo movie. Andre the Giant's in there, and he rocks.)  It was good fun, but it got better when her mom finally left the room if you know what I'm sayin. 

I thought I was going to be playing for chairs today, but I found out that it's going to be Wednesday at the earliest, and probably not until Thursday since we're going to Knobnoster (that's a dumb name) Wednesday. That irritates me, I wanted to get it over with today, and I had the option to, but I want to practice some more since it's not until later in the week. The football game will be good fun, but I don't really want to play. Like at all.  

I saw Rachel and Justin walking in the hall this morning between first and second hour.  It was so funny.. he has his arm around her, and she had this permanent ""justin"" grin on her face. b I laffed."

I just got back from conference band chair auditions.. I got 6th chair out of 12 players, but that's about what I expected, I wasn't all that prepared.  I would have liked to do a little better, but eh. There's always next year.  The auditons were more stress than fun, but the bus ride was great if you know what I'm sayin. 

When we got back to Lawson, I thought I was going to have to wait around for William because I thought I was driving him home, but it turned out he was riding with the Wilsons so that was cool.  When I went outside, it was pretty much just my truck and Dani/Nicole's car.. when I looked at it, something told me ""That car's unlocked.""  So I got in the back seat and layed down so no one could see me, and when the three of them got there I jumped out and scared them. More like sat up when Nicole started to open her door and freaked her out, but it was really funny.

"event","I am so pissed off.  I just found out today when I played the piece I'm taking to the KCI conference chair auditions that I've been playing it in totally the wrong style and haven't been counting it right... I'm really irritated with myself because usually I am excellent at playing all the right rhythyms for everything.  I don't have time to re-learn the piece the right way because the auditions are tonight, so I'm just going to play the first half of a song on the same page even though it's technically not long enough and it's easier than the one I wanted to take.  I know I play it right, though, because I've listened to that one on CD.  I really hope a lot of trumpet players chairing tonight are more incompetent than I am, because I'm not going to beat anyone with any talent.  The guy that gets first chair every year is an asshole, too.  Screw him. 

Also in the next week or so I have to do my chair audition for concert band, which is probably the most important, and the audition for jazz band.  I found out today that the jazz band audition was going to be tomorrow, and I haven't even looked at the music for that or the music for the concert band chair audtion that starts on Monday.  Potter's cancelling jazz band tomorrow, though, but I'll still have to audition before or after school sometime before Tuesday.  

Band is more trouble than it's worth."

"event","I just lost my damned car keys.  Can you believe that?  They were not in my pocket when I changed back into my jeans after the football game, I probably lost them when I changed.  I talked to the guy running the concession stand and also Mr. Edwards and no one's turned them in or anything.  I'll check with the office Monday.  I was already having kind of a crappy night and didn't originally plan on going to overtime but liz talked me into it (because she's awesome) but when I found out I lost my keys that just completely ruined my night.  I called my mom to bring me my spare set and just went home.  

We looked good in our new uniforms though.  And I think we played decent tonight, or at least I did and the people right by me did too.  I'm going to bed."

"event","I went with Liz and Rachel and Michelle and Chris to the haunted house in excelsior tonight.  I don't remember the name of it now, but I'm pretty sure it's the only haunted house in town. In a cave. It was pretty cool, I was reasonably scared, especially in the beginning.  People jumping out and sneaking up behind you and shouting and banging on the walls made me jump every time at first, but they do that so much that after a while I got used to it.  I've never been to a haunted house before; it was pretty good but I don't have anything to compare it to. Probably wasn't worth 15 bucks though, I dunno why it costs so much to walk through a cave.  Maybe that's a totally reasonable price and I'm just stingy/broke 

About halfway through the cave I lost my parents' cell phone.  It was in the pocket of my sweatshirt and probably fell out as we were crawling through this tunnel thing.  Losing my phone pretty much ruined the rest of my night, and I feel bad for putting everyone else through my bad mood.  I thought I was going to be in some serious trouble when I got home, and my mom was pissed, but I thought she was going to be yelling all night and it wasn't that bad.  She was more worried about some random person finding it and taking it home with them and running up a huge bill on it.  When we got out of the haunted house, I told the guy at the gift shop that I lost it, and he had some old dude next to him call somewhere in the cave with his radio and had them keep an eye out for it.  I also told the people selling tickets behind the counter and left my name and home phone.  They called me at about 10:40 tonight, they found it inside so I went back and picked it up at 11:00 or so.  I have it back now and I am SO relieved.. like you wouldn't believe.  I was probably going to end up having to pay for it if we didn't get it back, and we have a zillion numbers stored in there and losing those would have pissed off my parents worse.  

We went to Wal-mart just to screw around after we got done at the haunted house since it was still pretty early.  I'm not a big fan of Wal-mart and I wasn't in the mood to screw around, but I ran into a family from my church in there.  I haven't been to church for a while, and it was really good to see them.  I was still really upset from losing my parents' phone and didn't have to brains to introduce Liz and Rachel and Michelle and Chris to them, Liz especially.  I would have if I hadn't been in such a crappy mood, the Longs are really nice people and I think everyone would have enjoyed meeting eachother.  

I need to go to church tomorrow.  Like spiritually I need to go, and also I need to work out with Amy and Betty (The choir director and the organist) when I'm going to practice ""Built on a Rock the Church Doth Stand"" with the choir.  I talked about that a couple entries ago.  It's a really easy hymn and I can't believe the choir is singing it.  They usually sing crazy hard stuff that I can't really describe, but it's awesome.  My mom will probably go turkey hunting tomorrow since it's the last day, and my dad hardly ever goes to church anyways so I will just be going by myself or with Dana. 

If anyone was wondering about my short update earlier today, it was because Rachel was telling me I should update my journal.  So I did.  She called me a turd, but I bet she's more satisfied with this entry.  Speaking of Rachel though, she really wished Justin had been there tonight.  Rachel is so totally and absolutely infatuated with Justin.  She hardly talked about anything but him all night.  It was pretty cool.  

Anyway.  Laterdays."

"event","I'm sitting in Mrs. Miller's room right now.  This computer chair is so comfortable, it's made out of leather and awesomeness.  I want a chair like this for my computer at home, but since my sister and I used to have a reputation for slowly tearing up chairs, my mom won't put anything but a dining chair in the computer room.  It isn't comfortable at all.  

We watched pirates of the caribbean last hour again, it's a pretty good movie even though I've already seen it before.  At least I haven't seen it a basczhillion times like Liz, and she's watching it two hours a day.  Haha.  

I just took a little quiz thing that tells you which canidate for president you have the most in common with, like with their values and their plans for the country and that sort of thing.  I got 56 percent Kerry and 44 percent Bush.  It's a pretty good quiz, take it at http://www.presidentmatch.com/Guide.jsp2 and leave me a comment of what you get.  Unless you don't consider it any of my business, that's cool too.  Jerk. 

The choir at my church wants me to play with them on October 31st for Reformation.  I can't remember the name of the piece for sure, but it's something like ""On a Mighty Rock the Church Doth Stand."" On one hand, I like playing with the choir because they're awesome and I wish I could sing well enough to be in it, and accompanying them is the next best thing.  On the other hand,  I get nervous playing in front of that many people.  I got really nervous the last time I played at church, which was Easter, and I screwed up one of the songs a little.  Not very many people besides the choir and my family noticed, but I felt really bad.  I'm a reasonably good player, though, (not bragging, just saying I don't suck,) and the way I see it, God gave me this talent (it sure didn't come from lots of hard work and practice, haha) and what better way to use a talent like that than to praise Him?  I had that in mind last Christmas when I accompanied the choir, and I played so well... it was amazing, I've never played like that before, it sounded spectacular.  I've never played that well since then, either, not even this past Easter.  The song I played for Christmas was Joy to the World, though, which I consider pretty inspiring, so that probably contributed.

"event","It's been forever and a day since I last updated.  I kept starting to write in my journal, but couldn't hardly think of anything substantial to write and when I did and read it back to myself, it sounded retarded and superficial.  But anyways.  

Friday I went to the football game with Liz and Rachel and Michelle.  We dominated North Platte hardcore-like.  47-0.  We even sent in our freshmen against them, including this tiny guy Ryan Howard who is 5'2 or so and can't weigh a whole lot more than 100 pounds.  He was running after this guy about four times his size, it was hilarious.  When we got home, Liz's mom and sister were on their way from Target to pick up her and Rachel, who spent the night at her house.  I waited with them for 10 or 15 minutes, it was pretty chilly until we went inside but altogether not that bad of a time.  

Yesterday I woke up at 4:00 in the freaking morning to go to Trenton Band Day.  If you're not personally acquainted with 4:00 AM, let me inform you that 4:00 is an asshole and is not to be treated nicely.  In fact, give him a kick in the nuts from me the next time you see him around.  But seriously, even though it was way too early to be waking up on a saturday, I had a reasonably good time mostly because I was with Liz and she's awesome.  Like majorly awesome, not awesome in any minor, second-rate way.  I know she's going to read this so.. Liz, you rock! Anyway, I had to leave early because my parents wanted to visit with relatives in Trenton while we were in town, so I didn't watch the awards thing.  I called Liz's cell a little while after I got home, though, and found out that we got 4th out of 9 or 10 for the parade, which is pretty good for us and we got another trophy.  Trophies = w00t.  We had pizza for lunch too, Craig's family brought it which was amazingly cool of them.  Anyone that brings me pizza on a saturday when it's a zillion degrees below zero an hour and a half from home gets a w00t from me.  w00t from me.  

Today I went and saw MORE relatives, this time ones on my dad's side of the family.  I was at my grandparents' house from about noon to five, and I drove on the way up there.  I HATE driving when my dad is in the truck, he makes me nervous because he's the kind of guy that expects perfection from everyone, and he complains about a lot of things that are personal preference and don't really have anything to do with my abilities as a driver.  Things like which lane I drive in when I'm nowhere near my exit, and how fast I accelerate on on-ramps.  I'm a reasonably good driver and he totally doesn't appreciate that.  But anyway, some relatives I've never met while I've been old enough to remember them were at my grandma's today.  They're pretty cool.   They live in Kansas, I don't know why the heck I haven't seen them in so long.   They were pressed for time, though, and left around 3:30 so me and my cousin Nick threw a frisbee around in the backyard for the rest of the afternoon.  I love playing frisbee.  He hit my sister who was asleep in the hammock with one throw, and she got really pissed off.  I don't know if he did it on purpose or not, he's kinda funny about things like that, he would have thrown it at her on purpose if he thought everyone would have got a laugh out of it.  I think he expected her to just laugh and call him a dork or something like that, but she doesn't like things thrown at her.  It was altogether a great time, though, I love going to my grandma and grandpa's house.  They're awesome people, and their house is so much more comfortable than mine.. like their first downstairs (It's a multi-level house but only 2 stories.. it's hard to explain, but it's a lot like Liz's house I'm told.) is insanely homey and comfortable.  I've fallen asleep so many times reading on my grandpa's chair.  Their house is like my absolute favorite place to be except maybe asleep in my own bed. 

I'm really worried about Sunny still, she sounded really depressed and upset in her journal, but she seemed okay at Trenton yesterday which probably testifies that I am not very perceptive, which would be true because I'm not.  She was pretty upset when I talked to her tonight, too, which leads me to believe that she was upset saturday and I just couldn't tell.  We talked for a while tonight, and I don't really think I helped her out all that much except to be someone to talk to, but I'm glad I could be there for her. 

So tonight I started up a list in Notepad called Odds and Ends.  I'm not a poet or anything, and I haven't written a poem since we had to make a poetry book freshman year, but now and then I come across a word or a phrase that I think would sound interesting in a poem or a piece of short prose.  I've been meaning to start writing them down for a long time but finally got around to starting the list today with ""practical play by play of yesterday.""  Rachel said that tonight when I was talking to her about her journal entry about trenton.  I just sorta liked it, it both rhymes and is an alliteration.  Way to be, Rachel!  Anyway, I'll probably never use that list, but I made it anyway just in case I'm ever in the mood to write. 

Liz called me from the Renaissance Festival today.  She went with her sister, and they couldn't find the Hall of Tortures or whatever that little mini museum is called.  It's a pretty cool place, hope they eventually found it.  They were about to order fried ice-cream, or mentioned it at least.  Fried ice-cream is kind of an oxymoron, don't you think?  I've never tried it, but it doesn't sound that good.  

My mom is bugging me for the computer now, even though she's been on it the whole time we've not been in Kansas City today.  I need to go finish the homework I started before Liz called anyway, though.  I'm just saying that, I'll probably get off of here and fall asleep on the couch watching TV.  Who actually does their homework at home, anyway?"

"event","Liz and I are going out now, for those of you who haven't found out already.  Isn't that awesome?  I asked her at the football game Friday, I bet she was startin to think I was never going to ask but I was having hard time catching her by herself and in person. (cause I didn't want to do it over the internet or the phone, anything not in person is lame.) After the game friday, Me and her and Michelle and Chris Reese and Rachel all went out to Chris's house to watch a movie.  That was good fun, but the movie sucked.  But yeah I just got off the phone with Liz about thirty seconds ago, I was outside on the deck because that's the only place I can get any privacy. My dad starts knocking on the glass and looking out there, I thought he was trying to get me off the phone but it turns out he was just seeing if I was out there.  He didn't see me, and locked me out, haha.  But when I got back inside, he was like ""you guys talked long enough anyway"" and wouldn't let me call back.  Is that nazi-ish or what?  

So, this has been a pretty good weekend.  I already talked about how awesome Friday was, and then Saturday Ben calls me at the last second to see if I want to go see Taxi with him and Luke and Jared, who need to write a movie review for extra credit in their english class.  I went with them and am glad I did.. it was a pretty sweet movie.  Funny like you wouldn't believe and a bunch of good car scenes involving a very nice 7-series BMW.  

Today I went to the Renaissance festival.  It was pretty good, maybe not quite as good as last year but still pretty cool.  Jared was the only one of my friends that went but that's alright, we had a good time.  Especially the hall of tortures, that was pretty sweet.  It was like a little mini museum with a bunch of different torture devices.   We also saw a couple funny shows, and I almost played chess with a monk but we were getting low on time and he would have kicked my ass anyway, I'm not that great at it. 

Could the weather have been any more perfect today?  It was exactly how I like it.  A little bit cloudy and a little bit chilly.  Awesome."

"event","Sittin in Mrs. Miller's room.  I just got done with my math assignment for today so I thought I would sit here and update my journal in school cause I'm cool like that.  First hour this morning we had a junior class meeting about the magazine sales.  I really don't want to sell any magazines, but there's a cool class shirt involved if you sell twelve subscriptions.   I can probably sell twelve easy between church and all my relatives.  I'll buy (read: my parents will buy) a couple subscriptions for myself too, probably Sports Compact Car or a different car magazine, and then Popular Mechanics cause I'm a nerd, haha.  

We watched our Carrolton performance on DVD in Mr. Potter's room today, and it sucked like you wouldn't believe.  I didn't think we sucked THAT bad.  It was terrible.. people out of step everywhere, people that weren't even stepping on a beat, and then the band didn't tune beforehand so we sounded like CRAP the whole time we were playing.  I <b>seriously</b> hope we do better than that for the football game tomorrow night and then our performance at Trenton.  Especially Trenton, because some of my relatives are going to come watch us do our field show, and I really don't want to look like an idiot in front of my relatives.  

I need to get a book read by the end of next week for English Lit.  I'm just barely into Crime and Punishment at the moment, and it's pretty boring right now but I hear it's an awesome book so I'm trying to suffer my way through the crappy beginning. It's about a dude that kills (or is planning to kill, so far) an old woman.  I don't know what all else happens because I haven't read much of the book yet, but everybody has really cool names because the book is translated from Russian.  The main dude's name is Raskolnikov.  Are Russian names sweet or what?  Raskolnikov is almost as cool as Vogliardo.  Almost.  

I am STARVING.  I can always smell food in this room because Mrs. Embry's foods class is this hour and it's right next door.  It smells like they're making something with garlic, breadsticks probably, and I am totally in the mood for some garlic bread.  It makes my breath smell terrible, but garlic tastes awesome.   

Both of my dogs are sick and that sucks.  Nico has an ulcer on one of his eyes (wtf?  Who/what gets EYE ulcers?) and Leo has some weird lump under his neck.  Hopefully he doesn't have cancer like Nico had a few years ago, but I really doubt it because this is a really big lump and it showed up all of a sudden.. when my other dog had cancer on his head, the lump had been there for a while and was slowly getting bigger.  He probably just has a swollen gland or something.  Can dogs get strep throat? 

Anyways, I need to go check out in the office before the bell rings.  LUNCH IS SOON."

"event","So.. homecoming was last friday.  I already talked about the parade, but the football game was pretty cool too.  I don't remember the score, but we beat them and had a good time and all that.  It was a little on the chilly side, even though I was wearing a coat.  Saturday morning was the Northwest Homecoming Parade competition in band, had to get up at 4:30 in the freakin morning.  On the way to school, I couldn't see through my windshield hardly at all and was driving by feel, haha.  I don't reccommend that.  The competition was reasonably cool, we got a 3rd out of 5 bands which is better than we usually do.  Taking home a trophy is always cool.  Saturday night I went to a party in Kearney, but I should have gone to the dance.  The party wasn't as fun as I thought it was going to be, and I got extremely lost trying to find my buddy Dan's house out in the middle of nowhere in the country between Holt and Kearney, burned all kinds of gas wandering around.  I asked directions from a midget that works in the Dollar General, though, and even though she couldn't help me, asking directions from a midget is pretty cool.  At the party we played some football, ate some chili, and played a lot of pool.  Playing pool with people that don't know all the rules is annoying.  I won most of the time, I was playing a pretty good game that night.  

Sunday I was in Trenton all day.  My mom and aunt were writing thank you letters to everyone that sent flowers and that kind of thing to my grandma's funeral.  I hung out with my cousin most of the time.  That's always good fun.  

I got kicked out of fourth hour today by Mrs. Funk.  She hates me and always singles me out, I was turned around talking to Scott and even though half the class was talking she made me leave the room.  I was pissed.  I hate Mrs. Funk.  If I knew where she lived, I'd blow up her mailbox."

Even though I'm not going to the dance anymore, I'm pretty exited.  Homecoming is good fun, the football game will be awesome.  Of course the band is marching in the parade tomorrow, and even though I'd rather be watching from the curb, marching will be alright too.  What's gay, though, is that we're not marching in uniform, just like last year.  About a third or a half of the band will be wearing sports uniforms, and since we aren't going to match, we'll look like trash.  I know someone in a fall sport will read this and be like, ""shut up, you don't play a sport,"" but who the hell cares?  Everyone in school already knows who plays what sport, so what are you trying to prove by marching in your sport uniform?  Is it some statement like ""Look at me, I'm not a band nerd.  I'm above these guys, I play a sport.""  Grow up.  You're making us all look stupid, including yourself.

It sucks pretty bad, but she's been sick for a while now, with Alzheimers and it's a relief that she doesn't have to go through that anymore and is with God.  The visitation is tomorrow night and the funeral is wednesday so I won't be in school.   

Some of my friends are going through some troubles right now and I'm not going to violate any of their privacy by going into details.. but it's a LOT of people and it's getting to be a mess.  I'm always glad to help out my friends when they need it but I'm starting to get too much on my mind at once.  But if you're my friend and you're reading this, don't feel like you can't talk to me about anything.  I'm not mentally unstable or anything.  

Also I'm not going to the dance this saturday, at least not with Rachel.  It turns out lately she's not that into me and just leading me on.  There's more to it than that, but it'd take a pretty long time to write out and I don't feel like it.  It's not that big of a deal anyway, I'm just irritated that she wouldn't tell me and I had to find everything out from someone else.  I've been invited to a party in Kearney this saturday night for a long time now, so I might decide to do that after all, or also Liz invited me to go with their group to the dance.  

Carrolton was this Saturday.  It went alright, could have been better, could have been worse.  Potter was pissed this morning about a bunch of people that weren't treating their uniforms and stuff very well after the performance but I always put all my crap up right after we get done, just so I don't lose anything and I can keep track of it, so I let everything he said go in one ear and out the other since it didn't really apply to me.  

I'm tired and need some sleep so I'll be heading that way now.  Until next time."

Anyways, I rode the pep bus to an away game for the first time.  I hung out with William and Liz and Rachel and Chris Reese and and Sunny and Rebecca and Justin Wright.  It was pretty good fun until we got on the subject of duct taping freshman tomorrow at Carrolton.  It's just a little bit of tradition with the high school band, nothing big but it turns out William is against all forms of hazing, no matter what size. I haven't really talked to him about it yet but for some reason he's especially against us getting Ryan Howard which is this trombone playing freshman dude.  If you ask me, William's overreacting, making mountains out of molehills but we've been best friends for like going on 11 years now and I have too much respect for him to just totally ignore what he thinks, and since he feels so strongly about it I don't think I'll get involved with the duct taping, if it's Ryan Howard, at least.   That's not to say it won't happen without me and I won't have a good laugh along with everyone else, because the kid will probably get taped at some point in the day, and it will be funny. 

I want a new ride.  I don't know what the deal was, but my truck was driving worse than usual today.  I almost rolled backwards into a guy on the stopsign at Pennsylvania and Moss on the way home from school, because the transmission slipped into neutral like it always does at stopsigns and it's on a hill.  Normally I just let the truck roll a little until it catches; I didn't know he was behind me until I happened glance in my mirror.  From my point of view it looked almost like my tailgate was touching him, so our bumpers must have been pretty close.  We didn't touch, though, I didn't feel anything and of course he wouldn't have just kept driving like nothing happened if something did happen.  

Carrolton band day is tomorrow, like I already said.  I think we will do pretty good except for a few parts in the drill for Part 3 that are a little shaky.  For me at least.  We aren't going to totally embarrass ourselves or anything, though.  We're pretty decent.  

I got on the internet when I got home just now hoping to talk to William, or Liz/Rachel/Sunny who are all at Liz's house, because Sunny was talking to William the whole way home (as far as I know they were.  I was in and out of sleep) and I want to know what the deal is. Buuuut it's been about a half hour and neither of them are on, so I think I'll hit the hay.  Buenos Noches."

"event","So, sitting in Mrs. Miller's room again.  I'm so bored.  Usually when she doesn't have anything for me to do I work on the homework I don't have done from they day before but I don't have any right now.  Apparently there's a middle school football game today, the players are wearing their uniforms and so are the cheerleaders.  I'm glad I'm not in middle school anymore.  It sucks like whoa."

"event","Another average day in the life of another average teenager.  We didn't get to do our lab in chemistry today, because Mrs. Perry wasn't there.  Normally Mrs. Perry not being at school would put me in a good mood because I don't like her, but we were going to be playing with fire in the lab and you don't want to miss that, you know?  

After school I went to William's.  Played a video game for a little bit and then when Ben showed up the three of us and William's brother played Hearts.  Neither of them were in a Pitch mood, they played it in English 7th hour.  Oh well.  I woulda smoked them.  Ben drove his truck over there, so I guess he's got it running halfways decent again.  His truck looks nicer than mine, but I'd rather have a rusty POS that runs instead of something like his that barely starts. 

Have you ever thought of what you're going to name your kids when you grow up?  Probably more of a girl thing, but it crosses my mind every now and then.  I like the name Marcy for a girl and Tom or Julian for a boy.  Julian's kind of a weird name, but I think Julian Vogliardo sounds cool.  Maybe Julian Thomas Vogliardo? Who knows. 

I'm ready for a little winter weather.  I'll probably complain about it when it shows up, but I'm getting tired of having to have my window down anytime I drive somewhere because I have no air conditioning.  Also I have a black coat I like to wear all the time when it's winter and a hooded sweatshirt I like and then the letter jacket.  But you wear those in this weather, can you? 

I'm getting pretty impatient for my yearbook from last year.  Also my pictures from picture day, I want to know how they turned out.  Probably pretty crappy, I'm not very photogenic like at all.  But I want to see my yearbook for all the other stuff that will be in it.. senior pictures, activities, that sort of thing.  Yep."

I didn't really get it short enough, there's not a whole lot of difference from the way it was, plus I think I liked it better that way.  Except my sideburns which were getting way too bushy and are now nonexistent.  I'll grow them back. 

I did most of my homework today, except a couple of math problems I couldn't figure out and the last few questions on my history review which I'll have time to do tomorrow.  I don't really like history, and this test coming up is going to suck like history tests have never sucked before.  Too many names and dates to keep straight and a lot of them are the same name but with a different number, mostly king type guys.  

It took me almost an hour to write this entry, but but I was doing a few other things in the middle of it and kept losing my train of thought.

"event","So I'm sitting here in Mrs. Miller's room, I aid this hour.  I just printed the current event article I need for Contemporary Issues and since Liz will probably forget hers I went ahead and printed one for her too, since I'm nice like that.  If she remembered to bring one I'll just use the other one next week. 

I was supposed to do ten math problems last night out of the book, but I don't know how to do a lot of them and it's probably not going to be due today anyway since he's going to add onto the assignment, so why do it last night or today?  Homework is only 20 percent of the grade, so even if I took a zero on it (which I won't) it won't really hurt me.  I say that, but sometimes I really worry about my grades and my class ranking.  Freshman year I had a really hard time in Spanish and a little bit of trouble in geometry, and that took my GPA down pretty far.  At the end of freshman year I was ranked 26th in the class (which is waaaay low for me), tied with Kim Brazzle.  I stress out about the rankings all the time, because on so many of the scholarships out there, being in the top 10% of the class is a requirement for you to be eligible.  I'm up to 17th at the end of last year, and I need to go up at least 5 spots, and probably 6 to get up to 12th or 11th which is the bottom of the top 10%, depending on how many people are in our class but I think we have at least 110.  

There is no possible way I can go to college without financial aid or scholarships, my parents are poor.  I'll take out student loans if I have to, but I really don't want to get out of college and straight into debt.  So, I should probably go do those 10 problems."

"event","School was pretty normal today.  William was late to pick me up as usual, band practice was stressful as usual, I didn't take home my math homework as usual, Mrs. Perry pissed me off as usual.  Etc.  Except I found out 7th hour I have a B- in Contemporary Issues because a lot of the grade is based on participation and cooperation and I talk too much.  That really pisses me off, because if I have a B- for talking, most of the rest of that class should be failing and I really doubt they are. 

After school I got forced into driving to the library to pick up some books my mom reserved.  I didn't really mind, because I didn't have any plans and I haven't driven in a while.  I took my dog with me too, he likes to go for drives.  I ran into Angela at the library which is cool because I hardly ever see her, and I wanted to stay and hang out but my dog would have gotten way too hot waiting in my truck, even with the windows down.  If that dude on Oprah accidently killed his baby by leaving him in a hot car, my dog would probably die too.  Unless he has super powers.  But if he had super powers, would he use them for good or for awesome?"

"event","On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said,'We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'Relax,'said the night man,
We are programmed to receive.
You can checkout any time you like,
but you can never leave!"

So, I just now went through the ones she scanned, and she didn't scan very many of the ones I wanted and out of the ones she got and I wanted to put on here, only one of them didn't get blurry when I uploaded it, so here it is.

This is me on the deck of a whale-watching boat 3 or 5 miles offshore from Plymouth, Massachusetts where we were for our family reunion/vacation.  We saw some ridgeback whales and another littler kind I can't remember the name of.  I don't usually wear my hat that way, but the wind would have blown if off if it was forward.  Plymouth rock is pretty retarded, by the way.  I expected like a three story boulder... it's about the size of a small or medium-sized car, and all of my relatives stood around and stared at it for like 20 minutes.  It's just a stupid rock.  I don't really see how the pilgrims could even see it when they were coming into plymouth harbor. 

I'll try and maybe get some more pictures scanned later."

"event","I went to school today.  We started drill for part three of pirates of the caribbean today.. In some ways I like it better and in some ways I like the part one drill better.  It's weird.  Mr. Potter was there for the early practice but 2nd hour we had a substitute.  It was Mrs. Funk.  

Mrs. Funk hates me, I have no idea why.  She shouldn't, I am the most charming, agreeable, and pleasant student in that class.  Modest, too. I had her for a whole semester in 7th grade for GATE when Mr. Brown was sick, and yeah, we don't get along real well. Wasn't that bad today, though. 

Me and ben went to William's house after school today, and the three of us plus william's brother played some gamecube for a short while until that got boring and then played some Pitch.  Pitch is the best card game ever, if you didn't know, and today was the first time I've lost a game of pitch in months and months.  Especially at William's house, I don't think I've ever lost there.  I was partners with Ben, though, and usually I'm partners with William.  I don't really think that had anything to do with it, I just couldn't get dealt a good hand.  

I drove Ben home from William's since his truck won't start, and I floored it on 3rd street and actually saw the gas needle go down.  Isn't that crazy?  Talk about gas guzzling, geez.  I want a jeep.  If you have a Jeep, give it to me.  Or a corvette, those are nice too.

I thought there was something stuck in my throat, I freaked out and like tried to cough it up/spit it out.  It's gone almost back to normal now, but I can still feel the bottom of it touching the back of my tongue.  Isn't that sick?  

Anyways, I went to the doctor at 2:15 today and he says I have a sinus infection and probably strep.  He didn't bother to test me for strep to make sure, because he prescribed some antibiotic that's supposed to wipe out both the sinus infection and the strep.  

I hate hate hate hate sinus infections.  Freshman year I had an insanely bad one that involved CT-scans and excruciating days-long  migraines.  Migraine headaches are the worst pain on the planet.  That I've felt, at least. So hopefully this cold won't be as bad, but I doubt I ever get that sick again in the near future.  Knock on wood."

She couldn't tell it was me at the time, but my truck is pretty easy to recognize so she found it in the parking lot this morning and called the cops to have them run my plates.  The freaking COPS. So, third hour after she found out it was me she took me out of class and told me I can't drive to school for two weeks starting tomorrow.  It's not like I can ride the bus or anything either, have to be there at 7:00 for band.  William's going to pick both me and Rachel up though, (thanks William) so I can still get there on time.. or at least close to on time. Not only am I banned from driving to school, I'm not allowed to drive on school property for any reason, including stuff like football games.. it's a good thing it's only two weeks or I wouldn't be able to drive to homecoming either.

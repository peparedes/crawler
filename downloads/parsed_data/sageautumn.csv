I see a headline like the article above, ""Mom Tapes Toddler to Wall""... ...and think, wellll... given the options between losing it and taping a kid to a wall--the wall thing doesn't seem so bad.  I can think of choices where it would be the sane option.   

Of course, I also don't entirely see why you can't put a kid in a closet for a time out--if the closet is safe, lit, and a time out is a matter of minutes not hours or days.  Heck, some closets are about as big as some of my bedrooms were when I was little.

All that said, if you read the article... ...I'm totally not okay with taping a kid to a wall for a long time, because you're high, and being all mean about it.  That's a horse of a different color.

And in all honesty, I'm not a parent because my marriage was messed up for a long time, and I saw/see having a kid as a really bad thing to do to the kid in situations like that.  Plus my husband wasn't ever around, and didn't talk/communicate/etc when he was... so there's the whole ""If I wanted to be a single parent, I'd've been one"" thing."

"event","These may seem silly questions, but due to a skin spot/infection they've put my pup on 750mg antibiotics, twice a day, so now I'm wondering...

a-- Will this cause potty issues?  If so, any advice on what to give her to help that not be the case so much?

b-- How likely is it she'll get a yeast infection?  I know dogs can get them, but I think? it's usually young pups?  Again, any advice?

Megan is a 65 pit bull mix.  The lesions are on the left side of her face; one along her cheek and another above her eyebrow--they are ""my face will fit under this fence, oh, no it doesn't, here let me dig a little, how about now? Nope, still doesn't fit"" over and over spots.  

For both things, I'm thinking yogurt... but I don't know if I can get her to eat plain unflavored yogurt, and I don't know if the sugar in other yogurt doesn't outweigh the benefit.

"event","The best dating advice (for guys) I've ever heard was something that seemed pretty simple.   ASK GIRLS OUT. 

My best friend wasn't the best looking guy, didn't lead the most interesting life*, and he hadn't had a date in ages.  So he decided he'd try to have thirty dates in a month.  

Mind you, these weren't serious dates.  They were for coffee, or lunch, or a drink.  Sometimes they were more, most often they were not.  He asked out pretty much every woman who seemed even remotely interesting (in _whatever_ way) TO him.  They didn't have to seem interested IN him**, there didn't have to be much of a spark--he was looking for coffee, not a lifetime commitment or anything.  If it went well, fine... if it didn't go well, it was just an hour or so--no harm, no foul.

He got lots of dates--he ended up with about 45 or more if I remember correctly.  A lot of the women were ""out of his league"", and, sure, a lot of them weren't--but they were all practice.  He also got LOTS of rejection--which was also good!  He learned to be able to accept the rejection, to handle it gracefully, and to not let it get to him.

This is still the best advice I can think of, if you're out of the dating scene and want to be back into it.  

It's sort of a longer version of the best pickup line... which is simply, ""Hi.""

<small>*though it was interesting enough... he didn't creep people out or totally lack social skills.
**they also didn't seem EXTREMELY NOT interested--again, he didn't totally lack social skills."

This morning I wanted to send* a male on my friends-list a private message... something saying I sort of got what he was going through, and he wasn't alone in his feelings.  Nothing more, just... hey, I get you and where you're coming from, if you need to talk, I'm 100% outside, not invested, and am willing to listen**... and because of the nature of what's going on, I didn't send that since I was concerned it'd come off as ""let's get clooose"".

Which, I'm fine with getting closer to people, but not THAT sort of close. I've got some stuff in life going on I'm happy with, and and some crap going on that doesn't need more complications.   So I really didn't/wouldn't mean it that way, but would it come off like that?  Dunno, and I guess I'd rather err on the side of caution.  

Last night, I read a post on facebook to which I wanted to respond, ""In the most platonic way possible, that is incrediably hot!"" ... ... which I really am certain there isn't a way to say without it being weird.   But hey, what she did was really sexy and neat and whatever... and I have ZERO feelings about it other than ""Wow! How sexy that she does that*** herself!""

"event","Some of the guys I've been involved with have liked the porn*, some either haven't or hid it so well that I never knew (which is really well indeed!), some have <b>LOVED</b> the porn.

Mostly I don't care.  Lemme rephrase that and be more honest... ...mostly I don't care, so long as they're open about it.  Being all ""I.do.not.do.that!!!"" or ""I hardly ever do that!!!!"" or even, ""I do that maybe a little,"" when your browser history shows hundreds of things per DAY... ...that shit pisses me off**.  It pisses me off even more because I don't care.  If you're going to lie about something I don't care about, then you're lying about all the important stuff too.

(It also is annoying when a browser history is way way way clean, when I know that's not the case.  WTF.  Again--if you're like that about the little stuff, the big stuff is even more.)

<b>This entry has gotten away from me!!! All that crap above is NOT what I wanted to post about!</b>

Looking backward, I really do appreciate those guys who had a variety of women, or who liked stuff that I could (in theory) be somewhat considered in.  It's not that I don't expect them to look at/like the tiny blonde girls, but when they're mixed in with women who sorta look something like me... that's nice.

It means I can see you being attracted to me, or at the very least, not repulsed by me.  For a girl that's pretty repulsive to the majority of the population... that's kinda important.  (Well, okay, if not important, at least NICE.)

Soooo even though NONE of them will ever see this... ...for those guys that liked a variety--thanks.  :)

<small>I need to say... if tiny blondes are your thing, then hey, they're your thing.  That's fine.  I'm not holding it against you that that's your thing... I'm just baffled why the hell you're with me, when that's your thing!***

<small>*yes, to me pretty much anything that's not arty and is naked pictures is porn... I'm semi-aware that porn has somehow become more video only, I've no idea what just non-moving pictures are called... ...since there IS a difference in my head between porn and erotica.  (erotica is arty, porn is more obvious/vulgar)

**In general, I have to say being all ""I DO NOT DO THAT!!!!!!"" when it's really really obvious you do, pisses me off.  It also really really upsets me when I see you doing whatever that thing is, or find out that you did.  EVEN if it's something that I really wouldn't normally care about AT ALL.  (A great example of this is Calvin swore he DID.NOT.DRINK.  When I looked up and saw him downing a beer... I was PISSED.  Don't make something a stance and a big part of your persona, then do it... or rather, don't expect me not to be surprised, shocked, hurt, and ticked off.)

"event","I've been going for a couple years... here's what I've learned.

1.  Take your own toilet paper. 
What they supply is crap, and it's not worth the hassle.  Plus you'll be in and out of the hottub, and the pool and doing walking... scratchy-scratchy is bad always, but worse then.

2.  Either take charcoal, or don't. 
If you take it sometimes, and not others... you'll always guess wrong.  So either carry it always, or plan on getting it if you need it.

3.  You're taking too much food.
I suspect this is different for some people, who never take enough.  I can easily see it going one way or the other.  We've gotten better about this over the trips, and have it about cut down to the minimum (cutting it too close will make you feel stifled and your choices limited).

4.  If you're going for the shopping, the crowds, and the sites/shows/etc... stay in a hotel.
The prices are very low, and if you're not spending time in the room... why pay the extra?

5.  If you're NOT going for the shopping, and just going for getting away... cabins are totally worth it.
The right cabins are awesome.

6.  If you have a cabin, do all your laundry before you leave.
It's GREAT to come home and not have any dirty laundry... it doesn't take hardly any time to do it there while you're watching a movie, or whatever.

7.  Factor in the time it takes to get down the mountain, and the time it takes to get through crowds/traffic.
It's so easy to be late for stuff, forgetting it takes an extra 20+ minutes just to GET to the main roads.

8.  If you've something you really like, take everything to make it happen--don't assume it'll be there.
Some cabins will be really well equipped, others will have hardly anything.  Some that are well equipped will have everything but a cork-screw or a lighter or whatever cause some jackass stole it.

I'm sure there are others... but that's what came off the top of my head."

I saw the whole Lady Gaga/bisexual label issue thing.

I said I wasn't going to work at the mall any.  I've been there most of the day for both Monday and today/Tuesday.  But I didn't get paid, and it wasn't the full day... it was a choice and somehow that makes it different.

"event","Kinda jumping on a bandwagon I've seen on my friendlist.  I've never been the post-y... I'm one of those that just comment a lot.  I do, I admit, post a decent amount on Facebook, where it can be short and sweet and doesn't have to be a long thinky post.  So I'm not saying I'm going to post a lot... I probably won't.   I <b>may</b> start posting on things that I've thought about to post--just the ideas, not the full posts... who knows.  I DO think those sorts of thoughts a few times a week.

Maybe this is the result of having a lot of authors and thinkers on my friends list, but unless I have a lengthy, thoughtful, well-researched post... ...I pretty much don't think what I have to say is really worth saying here.  Facebook is facebook, who cares if I'm wrong there, it's just crap I'm spouting off with anyway and what's going on in my life--in short snippets.  

Facebook has one large failing for me though.  

My parents.   And my siblings/sibling-ishes/whatever.  
All of those relationships are very complicated for me.  

My half-sisters friended me... first my eldest (who is exactly a decade younger than I), then the youngest (who I think did it at the urging of her best friend who also friended me), then the middle one (who I think was giving into some weird peer pressure thing from her sisters).  Then my step-sister--who I have met perhaps three times--sent me a request, and I confirmed that request also.  

They've no idea who each other is (are?)*, so that's not the weirdness. My mother is also my friend, and that IS weird... but not what I'm talking about today.  Nor am I going to talk about how weird it is to try to appropriately communicate on a personal level with three sisters I adored, but haven't seen for about ten years or the turbulence of the time before that--which is and was totally weird.

Nope... not those things.  But my Lexie/Meredith Grey* moment, I totally want to spout off about that.  And I can't do it on facebook, since as weird as the relationships with all these girls are--I <b>do not</b> want to hurt them, and I don't wish any of them ill at all.

But, but... BUT... <b>YOUR parent is not MY parent</b>.  My sisters got a crap deal with my mom, so did I.  It was NOT THE SAME crap deal.  I got a crap deal with my dad, perhaps my step-sister did also*, but if she did it was reallllly NOT THE SAME crap deal.

So I censor myself a lot when it comes to my parents.  I censor offhand-funny remarks where I could say ""Geez! that sounds like my mom!"" even when it totally does.  I censor when I'm overly aloof or distant or overly logical or simply not there, and it reminds me of my dad.  I censor silly meme's that ask things about parents--or I answer for people not my parents.  Or heck, I censor simple moments and thoughts.

Because I don't want to hurt the feelings of people I don't really know... by answering stuff in regard to who people were/are to me--good and bad*.

My sisters don't know the 25 year old single mom who played ""Worm and Squirm*"", made Cream of Wheat for me while we watched Captain Kangaroo, and took me to work with her a lot and kept me in the car/kennel/tack room while she worked.   They also don't know what it's like to be left in a van outside a bar in the middle of the night, to hear your mom didn't come home because she slept in a restaurant booth, to reasonably be Very Concerned about being forgotten somewhere, or to be three and stay up all night sitting on the very back top of a couch because she said she'd say goodnight and tuck you in--only to see the sunrise*.  

My mom was craptastic for them too... I have <b>no</b> doubt.  And in ways that I probably have only an inkling of... but it was DIFFERENT.

My stepsister doesn't even know the guy of whom my first memory is him sitting on a couch, telling my mother and I that he was moving to Seattle.  Though, to be fair, I don't really know that guy either.  She also doesn't know the guy that came back from Seattle(for a while), played D&D and volleyball with his siblings at huge family gatherings.  Again, to be fair, I don't really know that guy either.  But there's a whole lifetime of slivers and not-knowings and inklings and ponderings... ...and mostly he comes off as kinda a jerk.  I admit, it is very hard for me to not ask her, ""Hey, is he REALLY a jerk?!""

So, yeah... ...they're the same names, the same DNA... ...but when it comes down to it, they aren't the same person.   They were younger.  My mom had more potential.. and failed more stunningly.  They weren't as experienced--at my current age, I have a lot of forgiveness in me for some of the crap from then.  They simply, totally weren't the same people.  In a lot of ways, they weren't even remotely close.

<b>Your parent is NOT my parent.</b>  
And sometimes... facebook totally fails me... because I want to say something about my mom. Or my dad.

<small>*I also sometimes entertain thoughts of pointing them to each other going--hey, that's who that is! but I recognize that's totally without point... ...and yes, would be totally weird of me to do, and likely for them also.
**those that follow will recognize the stuff that follows, because that moment of that episode was what clicked this issue into place for me.
***but not so much, cause her mom was/is kinda awesome, yo! and a large part of the crap deal with my dad was simply absence.
****I was going to say this is more of an issue with my mom... then I realized it really isn't, it's just a different type of issue with my dad--as in they pop up in different ways.

<i>Rosemary and Rue</i> I enjoyed thoroughly*.  New world, new ideas, new play on things, all in all a wonderful book.  Twists that were realistic within the book, and where there was predictable it was acknowledged by everyone except the main character who was too blinded by other stuff to see it.

In <i>Habitation</i>, I wanted to know more about the WORLD--the quirks and politics and... just the world it was based in.  And the world didn't let me down, not even once, not at all.

In <i>Feed</i>, the world was well-built** (but by premise, not entirely new), and the action and how the action unfolded was different and new and wonderfully written... and everything was so well thought-out and realistic.

So... predictable, but I enjoyed the hell out of the writing... taking less than 24 hours to finish Feed, and finishing Habitation in about a day.  Must be doing something right!!

Hell, come to think of it, maybe the distance was the part I was good at.  I've always been good at the distance part--still am--it was the coping and dealing part I sucked at, then.  so I just didn't.  ... ... Still don't, but do better than I did."

"event","Someone posted in a group I'm in about how she smelled... ...and since I wrote like 5000 words on the subject, I figured I'd toss it up here so I could point back to it if/when it comes up again.  It's something that does come up, more often than you may think.


Okay.  I'm a BIG GIRL... and I'm just going to say what works for me.

Well, no, I'm going to say what works for me after I say DO NOT USE TALC... which has nothing to do with if it causes cancer or not or whatever... it has to do with it being ground-up-rocks.  It might work, for a little bit.  Then it'll get wet, and grind into your skin and be bad bad bad*. 

Okay, on to the TMI part of our program.  

First off, I use soap/shampoo/body wash/something on a poof all over, and concentrate on my fat rolls****... to really really exfoliate the skin there.  NOT TO RUB IT RAW, though... which can be a fine line.  After you've been sweaty all day sometime, run your fingers over the fold at your thigh and see if you're getting a build up of dead skin--same thing under your tummy.  This is the stuff you want to get off with a poof.  I admit I'm lucky in that I can use ANYthing on my vag and it doesn't make it unhappy.  But find something that doesn't upset yours, and use it**.

Second, rinse well.  Then rinse some more.  Soap buildup is NOT your friend.  Usually after I've shaved my legs, and shampooed my hair, I'll rinse off my poof entirely and give all the key spots another very light brush... just to make sure there's no soap there and it's well exfoliated. Make sure water rinses inside all the creases a few times.

Here's where it gets weird, but is--to me--the most important two parts.

Third... after everywhere is nice and clean, and you've done all the shower stuff you're going to do, but while you're still in the shower... put on a very thin layer of baby oil*** especially in all your creases (except for your armpits).  I even make sure to hit the divet at the top of bottom.  I usually do this while I have conditioner on my hair so it gives it time to soak in.

Rinse again, but not quite as well.  All you're doing is spreading the oil a bit, and letting the excess rinse away.

Fourth--the absolute most important part... DRY OFF.  I mean, really, seriously dry off.  Drying off water with a towel when you have baby oil on is SUPER easy, all you have to do is pat dry really.  But after that, DRY OFF... <b>lay in front of a fan</b> for about five-ten minutes, and let the air get to all your pieces parts.  Eagle-spread, bottom in the air, on each side stretched so the fan hits any creases there and your armpits, on your back with your boobs pulled up... kinda like a rotisserre chicken, only moving slower and pausing.  

So... that's what I do.   It WORKS for me.  It works really really well for me, and I did have issues before--both with scent and with comfort (I'd get raw spots and/or external yeast infections, esp under my boobs.)  And while everyone else here is telling you if you think you smell you probably don't, I'll disagree.  It's probably not as easy to figure out how/why/where/what you're smelling like, but if you're scented enough to smell yourself, you may very well be 'scented' to others.  I don't mean it mean, I've been there, and it sounds like you may be also.

Plus, my skin feels amazing.  (I have to keep the baby oil off of my face and back, though, or else it'll make me break out.)

OH!!!!   And in the summer when it's really crazy hot, I'll do all of the above, and when I know I'm super super dry... I'll take just a dab of deoderant (I use Secret Gel myself), and slide it under the crease at my tummy, and sometimes at the crease at the top of my thighs.  I don't do this all the time--I imagine it'd get irritated if I did?  (Not sure)  But I only do a dab--like I'll click it up once then back down again, so just a little is left on the top, and kinda dab it across the area to apply.

<small> *In this, as in the whole thing, of course your milage may vary, you may have a totally different experience.  But I know for me, and for others I've talked with... grounduprocks is bad.  Maybe not all the time/every time, but once it gets you, it GETS YOU.
**not internally of course, but outside?  ab-so-lute-ly
*** Neutrogena makes a body oil that also works... but baby oil's cheaper and works just as well.
****the joint where my thighs meet my kitty--super important since I don't shave bare, under my tummy, under my boobs, in my belly button, and the creases at my sides"

I see that it's tight for a LOT of people... the tight varies, of course--for some of my friends it's scaled back to more than what I'd've done anyway cause they're just like that/life-stationed like that, whatever.  And I realize that a lot of women on my friends-list will be cutting their own Christmas wants short... partly because less cash in the household means less cash for someone to get them something, and partly because... well that's what women do--set their own stuff aside until others are taken care of, even if that sometimes/often/always/whatever means that their stuff never gets dealt with.

"event","People say denial doesn't work.

I say they must be doing it wrong.

Denial works quite well, when done properly.  If noone else was there, then it didn't happen.  If noone else saw it, then it didn't happen.  If the only other person who knows it happened sure as hell doesn't want to admit it any more than you do... ...then easy, it didn't happen.

Denial lets you ignore things entirely, because they DID NOT HAPPEN.  There's nothing to talk about, there's nothing to cope with, there's nothing to figure out... because NOTHING HAPPENED.  There's not even anything to deny, since... again... DIDN'T HAPPEN, so why the fuck are you asking me about something that didn't even happen?  Why're you looking at me crazy, cause you're the crazy one, dude... remembering bad stuff that didn't happen.  Sheesh.

It works pretty damned well, honestly.  It just takes a little bit to sink in.

When I was ... well, we'll say young.  I was ""Not Raped""*  And it took me years to even come close to acknowledging it.  It didn't happen.  I didn't go where I wasn't supposed to have gone, I didn't do anything out of the ordinary that day, and if you heard anything, someone made something up, because it wasn't me.  

Years passed, and it became something that happened to ""someone I know""... as in when someone would share what happened to them... I'd acknowledge something like that had also happened to ""someone I know."" 

More years passed, and I can come much closer** to acknowledging it.  ""Yeah, something like that happened to me... it was years ago. I'm over it.""   

And I am.  Over it, I mean--as much as anyone can be.  Denial gave that to me.  It gave me the distance between the event and the processing of the event that I required to not be broken by the event.

It was also the first time I knew I was staunchly denying something to myself.  Not the first time I did... but the first time I knew that I was <b>choosing</b> to process something in that way. It worked.  It worked well, and is a skillset I have under my belt. 

I never used it often, but I would now and then... when something so earth-shifting happened that the choices were either it didn't happen, or my entire life would change in ways that were not for the better. 

My life has been stable for a while, for years... and so I'm rusty at denial, I haven't had to bring it forth for quite a while. 

Something happened recently--nothing sexual in the least... not a rape unless your trust can be raped... and I was dealing with it, slowly, but I was.   Then it happened again... ...and it COULDN'T have happened again.  Happening again would break me, happening again would be the end of a very very dear relationship--I had made that very clear, and I did (and do) mean that.  So... ...it DIDN'T HAPPEN***.

And I'd forgotten that while denial <b>does</b> work pretty damned well, that it does take a little bit to sink in.  I'd forgotten the beginning.

I'd forgotten what it was like to close your eyes, think of something and have to automatically replace it with another normal memory... to have to be quick enough to instantly block when a thought blocks up with ""DIDN'T HAPPEN"" and mentally move on before it even really registers. 

I'd forgotten how stupid it makes you feel to do this, to know that you're choosing to be stupid, to accept--hell, to REMEMBER a course of events that didn't happen.  

I'd forgotten the feeling of worthlessness that comes with blocking things from yourself for your own protection... ...because the other side of that coin is acknowledging*** that what you truly feel doesn't matter to anyone else other than you... and it mattering to you isn't an option because the levels of pain you'd have to go through to deal with it now, to cope, to talk about it... ...would break you.

I'd forgotten how frail that makes you feel, because even while you know denying things to this level is hard as hell and not everyone can do it... ...the other side of that coin is that you're weak...much too weak, much too soft, too spineless, too feeble to be normal and process things and talk them out... and talk and talk and talk.  (I'm not/have never been good at talking pain out, it only makes things hurt even more.)

I'd forgotten the cost of denial.  But I can pay it, the other choice is worse.



<small>*I am assuming everyone knows what ""not raped"" is.  It's where you have sex, didn't want to, probably/maybe even say that you don't want to, often with implied instead of actual force... where you don't end up battered and bruised and left for dead, because you didn't fight like you should have, and maybe you didn't even argue ""enough"" because you didn't get hurt (well, other than the intercourse part, but that doesn't count)... and when, because of all that... and even more because you were in a situation you shouldn't've been in... things happened that happen to girls that are ""stupid enough"" to ""put themselves"" into those situations, where ""what else did you expect??""  Not Raped often means giving up before the battery, giving into the fear, and often taking the blame on yourself for being where you shouldn't've.  

http://www.racialicious.com/2008/12/21/original-essay-the-not-rape-epidemic/

**I say closer because, honestly, there're still sets of people--family for instance, or people who knew me then--that I would and will deny anything happening to me.  Nothing bad ever happened to me, course not.  (Being ""Not Raped"" was only one in a line of things that didn't/haven't happened.)

***And yes, I realize that ANYtime I pull this skillset up, it tends to bring forth the frame-of-mind and events that have made it useful/needed in the past.  So yes, lovely little snowball effect there.

</small> All comments are screened--if you'd like to share something with me, I wanted that to be allowed... but I'm not debating about if this is smart/healthy/etc... and this entry will go POOF in a few days, because... well... nothing happened, so why would there be anything to write about?"

You <b>have</b> a beautiful body.  

Find yourself appealing, and let it shine through... in your manner, in your attitude, in your responses to the world.

If you don't find yourself appealing... then... simply put, let someone worship you.  I promise, hand to God, that there are people who find you in the very top rankings of physical desirability.

Find someone* who is <b>truly</b> into your body type... and <b>let</b> them be into your body.  Let them show you, teach you, that you're appealing... that you're worthy of attention and of desire.  Without changing anything about you.  You--just <b>exactly</b> how you are.

Soak in being appreciated on a purely physical level... delve into their desire, their want, their lust.  It can go as far as you'd like, or not--personally, I think farther can be good... the more it hits things home, the more you can tell if it's real, the more you can feel the ""realness"" of their responses.  But it doesn't have to go any farther than meeting for soda at a coffeeshop.  Just let yourself meet people that find you, as you are, appealing.

Let them use you as the perfection of what they desire... ...and in turn, use them** to learn and find your own appeal.  You needn't feel appealing, but it's rather hard to deny it when it's staring you right there in the face.

<small>*Not as hard as you'd think and sure as hell not as hard as you'd think... no matter what your body type... just a matter of the right website, and being willing to explore seeing/dating people who may not be <b>your</b> ""type"" for a longterm relationship.   

If you don't already know this--truly know and believe it through and through--there <b>are</b> people out there that are <b>into</b> your body type.  It doesn't matter if you're five foot square (both tall and wide)... It doesn't matter if you're 6 feet tall and 100 pounds... It doesn't matter if you're missing limbs... or bald... or crosseyed... or whatEVER***.  Someone out there is into it... way more someones than you think... and chances are there's some of those someones near you.

**I realize how harsh this sounds, but it's really not.  So long as you're upfront about <b>not</b> looking for a long relationship, and they are the same.  This is totally a win-win relationship---with you getting the attention, and them getting an object to lavish the affection upon.

***Now... ...this is to say that you are COMPLETELY upfront and brutally honest about what you look like, what your body is, what you physically are.  Otherwise, you're totally setting yourself up to be discounted due to your looks.

</small> I also realize this is totally objectifying yourself.  To which, I say... ""<b>So??</b>"""

Nothing but water works.   Even better if you're smart enough to drink the water AS you're drinking alcohol--equal parts, and ice counts as water.  Hangovers come (mostly) from dehydration.

If you haven't remembered to drink water--then drink two huge huge glasses right before bed, and take a few pre-emptive Advil and asprin.  Both is even better--and they're different types of drugs, so you can take both.

Now... if you've forgotten this totally... and wake up with a hangover?  You're pretty much screwed, but the same stuff applies.  Drink water/repeat/repeat/repeat/etc."

For about ten years now... or maybe twenty... my family has celebrated Christmas on the Saturday <b>after</b> Christmas*.  

So I do most of my shopping when all the big sales are going on directly after Christmas... though I do also do some here and there throughout the year.  Bad thing about <b>that</b> is I usually end up giving them the stuff beforehand cause I just can't help myself.

<small>When all of her kids started getting married/having kids/etc... and it was rushing to make appearances here and there and yonder... ...Gran changed our Christmas celebration to the Saturday after so there'd not be conflicts.  Sooo... woe, woe, woe!! be unto you should you not make Christmas."

"event","This weekend, I went down to Manchester--which is a hell of a drive--to a much larger auction.  It was the auction Ford Brothers had mentioned last weekend.  

And boy oh boy did I spend way too much! (sorta)
And I only really bought two things!

One was a really cute little primitive-type child's bookshelf.  It's red, and has glass shelves inside of a wooden frame... and the top of it has these little Dutch figures painted on it, with a piece of glass over it.   I paid $30, which was the highest I was going to go for it... and was probably too much.  I'll mark it $38 and be happy if someone looks at it sideways.   

I'm telling myself that it can be stacked on top of something (since it's so small), and be used as a display shelf.  And it can.  And it <b>is</b> cute, cute, cute.

The other was where I probably fell down.  It's an old Bissell display rack, probably from somewhere between 1910-1930.  It's a wooden frame, with cast iron details---the rack parts and the feet are all cast iron.  It really is cool, and I liked it as soon as I saw it.  I thought it would go for a lot/lot/LOT! so when the bidding went down under $100, I bid on it.  So did another woman.  And we back and forthed until I won it at $180.   Good heavens. I'd already mentally set my limit at $150, but... it's a really rather interesting piece, and even at the auction there was a lot of interest in it--not bidding, but people looking at it. So I overshot by about $30... and hit my budget hard (I'd allowed up to $250 for the day--if I spent everything I had in reserve for stuff). 

It can also be used as a display shelf, if I want to put the time/effort into adding glass shelves.  The wooden frame is in perfect condition, but some of the iron is missing (I have ten out of sixteen ""arms"" and most of the slots for them--but some of the slots are cracked/broken).  So I have definately broken my own rule of not buying anything broken.  That's annoying me a little.

It's a cool piece, though it needs a bit of TLC... and if I put shelves on it, I guess I wouldn't mind hanging onto it for a while.

When I take it in, I'll put $210 on it... if I put shelves on it, I'll put $265.  

The bad thing about it is... I broke my rules.  It's not totally intact, and it is one of those things that I'll have to hang onto until the ""right person"" comes along.

I also have to figure out how to tell Gran how much I paid for it, cause she'll think I'm crazy... ...or... ...how much to tell her I paid for it may be the way to go.  (In which case, $140 sounds good.)

I also stopped by the local Salvation Army and bought some brass candlesticks at fifty cents each... I marked them $1.00-$1.50, and will put them out for Christmas.    I think if I can find a red or red/green plaid ribbon, I may put a bow on them too... just to liven them up."

"event","<lj user=""onceupon""> replies to a question I sort of turned on her***... <i>What type of stuff IS your type of stuff? I was reading about your auction hauls and it sounds great - I am a fiend for stuff like that as materials for making new stuff - but I wondered what you actually look for when you go out to auctions or estate sales.</i>

The shortest answer and what the answer <b>should</b> be is : Anything I think I can make money on.   That <b>is</b> my gran's answer.

But it's not really the answer for me--even though I know it probably should be.  

First off, there're often things there that go for very cheap--a table that would bring $450 in the antique mall that goes for $175.  My budget simply isn't normally that large... so there goes that idea.  

Secondly, I made a ""promise"" to myself when I started that I wouldn't buy things that were broken.  I have missed on this one once or twice... but in general, if something isn't in good (not neccessarily mint, but <b>good</b>) condition I'll pass it by even if I do think I could make money on it.  

Also, I <b>try</b> to get things that if I don't sell them... I like them well enough to keep--OR--I spend so little that I could toss them and not care.

And lastly--and perhaps most stupidly--I'm not really trying to make money.  At least not much.  The rule-of-thumb that Gran uses is pretty much she wants to double, or triple her money (and, of course, if she can do better, even better).  For me, though... this is more of a hobby to pass the time, and an excuse to get out of the house and spend money... ...that has the ability to not actually be spending money.  If I can get back what I paid for something, I'm pretty happy.   If the net result* is that I'm down 10% of what I paid (remember, I don't pay much, my budget is small)... I'd still be pretty happy.  It's better than buying crap that I don't need at WalMart.

Now, don't get me wrong... if I buy something for $2.00 and I think at $8.00 would still let it sell quickly and be a bargain price on it... I'm putting six to eight bucks on it.   

What I haven't really done (and don't plan to) is more like... buying something at $2.00 that's really worth $30.00 to the right person... ...and putting $30.00 on it.  I'd put  $15.00 on it and hope another dealer (from our mall or from another mall) would see it and know they'd be able to make a decent amount on it---and letting them get a deal** and making it so <b>they</b> have to wait for that ""right person.""


<small>*net result--after gas, tagging, and the % the mall takes out
**thereby making it more likely for them to visit our store again and look for another deal
***She posts, ask me a question... I asked, ""What simple thing would you like to know about me?"""

"event","For anyone who doesn't know already... I work in the auto-industry*.  During our benefit rollout, the president of our company put the situation for the auto industry in perspective for us with this statement**:

<i>The amount the industry (as a whole) is down, is equal to the number of all vehicles Chrysler and GM sold last year.</i>

To me, that's pretty damned sobering.  Even <b>Toyota</b>*** is down--by eighteen percent!

  

He said some other things... the balancesheet for our company is still positive (others are bleeding) in large part because we don't have a lot of debt and also because the bonuses and raises we didn't get last year (that everyone was mad about) were put into t-bills and are stockpiled.  We're currently positive, and have the shelter to weather a storm for a while... luckily, Toyota also has a very nice balancesheet, and a lot of our business is done with them.  We're also still (god knows how) gaining business, which is always good... and if we can get in when times are bad, we should be in an even better position when times bounce back.

And he said they will bounce back.  It may be a very different landscape---there may be Indian cars or Chinese cars that we're catering toward, or we may stride farther into the insurance or inspection branches of the industry.

On the other hand, he also said he's been through a few up/downs... and he's never seen it 'get so bad so fast'.  I bet <b>that</b> sentiment has been echoed through a BUNCH of industries.

<small>*(Or, maybe I work in the transportation industry, but deal only with auto-stuff... either way, same deal.) (My husband definately works in the auto industry, no two ways about it.)

**with the projection that November and December are approximately the same as September and October's numbers.

***For Toyota to be down, especially doubledigit down, is really unheard of."

"event","Here's what I bought at the first auction:
Karo Syrup sign:  12.50
Pulley w/ 1/2 singletree:  3.00
Misc Tools: 9.00

At the second auction:
medium/small brass bucket:  22.50
brass tray:  2.00
weather:  2.00
Brass and tray:  5.00
hand saws:  3.00
box lot:  5.00

I didn't do anything good at the first auction and spent way too much for what I did get.  The Karo Syrup sign is cute--it has the Dionne quints featured, but it's new and still has some light damage.  The pulley is greasy-ish and the singletree is totally worthless except as a decorating piece.  The misc tools were an old fire extinguisher--which was in much worse shape than I thought, and an eagle--which was aluminum, and not brass.  At the first auction I did badly, and lost money.  I'm making myself feel better by saying I enjoyed it--which I did, and that it was my first auction, and good that I just got my toes wet--which it was, and it did help me*.

At the second auction... I did much better.  The brass bucket I probably paid a bit too much for--I won't be making anything much on it, but I also didn't hurt myself either.  It's a nice polished one.  Overall, I got five other pieces of brass, one of which is pretty nice--it has a lip and has an oriental scene/figures on it.  I'll do okay on them.  The weather thing--a wooden frame with a barometer, thermometer, and humidity reader on it--was really disappointing.  I thought it was brass, but it was just plastic or tin.  Still, I won't be losing any money there, at two bucks.  

The handsaws and the box lot were my best pieces of the day!   I got five handsaws for three bucks, four of which were nice.  (One was just weird.)  The box lot was a bunch of crap, but in it there was also a white throw, a large offwhite bedspread--the old cotton ones with the raised thread, a set of calendar prints, an oldstyle feather pillow, two towels--both with crazy 70's prints on them, and some misc stuff.   I also got an army/military type hat, and a spoon rack.

I priced everything as follows:
Heavy Round Oriental Etched Brass Tray:  28.00
Oblong Brass Tray, Girl Hauling Water:  5.00   x2 (I got two of these)
Heavy Round Hammered Brass Tray:  12.50
Heavy Little Brass Bucket:  32.00
Barometer, Thermo, Humidity Wall Hanging:  9.50
1973 Calendar prints, mostly Currier and Ives:  4.00/all
Old Timey Feather Pillow:  3.00
Two Muted Color Floral Print Pillows:  1.50/pr
Crochet Covered Pillow w/retro colors:  3.00
Black and Bright Satiny Pillow**:   3.00
Off White Bedspread:  28.00
Woven Lap Throw, White w/Heart Design:  5.00
Retro Towel, 60-70's design:  2.00    x2 

Eagle, nicely detailed, hang over door or above garage:  8.50
Karo Syrup Sign w/Dionne quints:  12.50

I haven't priced my saws yet--my aunt thinks I should give them as Christmas presents (but I think she's crazy and noone would want a handsaw!!). I did sell one to her, though--for $5.00.  I gave her another one, cause it was weird and new and couldn't really go in the mall.  (If I price the others, they'll probably be 9.50 or 12.50 each--they are nice, and have a bit of detail on the handles... but they're not ""that"" old.)

I sold the hat and the spoonrack to my gran for $5.00, then sold her the fire extinguisher for $1.00, and the pulley and singletree for $3.00.  I'm glad enough to be rid of the pulley--I broke even, and as soon as I'd left the first auction I knew I'd paid too much for everything.  I'm happy to have the dollar out of the fire thing, and I do hope she can make something on it.

If I take out for the leather LazyBoy recliners I bought for Leon... and don't include gas or anything... (but do include the tax I paid)... I spent about seventy dollars.  A bit much, yes... but I did have fun, and didn't do toooo badly once everything got priced out.


I'm still pondering if I want to go to another auction next weekend or not.  Finances will decide that, to a point... but I think I could take even $50 and still have a decent time, and do okay.   The people that held the second auction are having another estate auction this coming weekend... ...I'm thinking about heading to it.   And I _think_ I'll have about $125 to play with.

Paycheck after this one, though... it's definately bill time!


<small>* if nothing else, I figured out I needed to write down what I'd bid on and what I paid, because I couldn't remember when I got up there to pay for it, and they could've ripped me off

**It's black satin with a kinda pretty, busy orange pattern through it... it looks vague oriental, and is almost definately a chair cushion/pillow... but I didn't want to write that in case someone wanted to use it for something else"

"event","---I had the most wonderful massage yesterday at LHAA.  Anyone reading this locally should go and hit this guy before he graduates.  I think he's new, so he was a bit hesitant--not tentative, but now and then I could feel him checking to make sure he had the correct line.  (So either he's new, or he hasn't had much experience with massive women/people--honestly could be either one.)  But even with that... his head, neck and shoulder work was superb, and I felt better than I have in AGES after leaving.  Since I go every two weeks, that's saying something.

I guess it would be helpful to say--his name was Chris.  Connelly, I think? something like that.  I wish they'd/I hope they'd think about keeping him as a graduate.  The student I usually been seeing lately, Alyssa?  She's awfully damned good too... VERY STRONG hands, and very detailed.  She's also be a good addition.   (That said, I think if they kept everyone I've liked, they wouldn't have room for students.)

Both Chris and Alyssa are, without a doubt, way beyond my usual level of ""oh they're good enough to keep.""   My massage yesterday was <b>amazing</b>.

Lexington Healing Arts Academy is the best deal going for massage.  $30 for an hour, and you're not allowed to tip.  Everyone should treat themselves to this.

---I wonder what the reqs even are for keeping a student on as a graduate.

---Pondering doing the sexuality meme.  I've done it a few times now, but I always seem to misplace one pin in a horrifying way.  I had it yesterday, until I proofed it and found that I'd done <b>cocaine</b> and not alcohol.  Whoops!  (On another one, I wanted to try something that I didn't even know what it was.)  (I will say, I have googled a LOT from that map!)

---Pondering doing the ""100 Things about Me"" meme also... but that'd require ....
--wondering how to do a filter
--realizing I <b>might</b> post more, and might be more interesting if I had a filter  (I have wondered/thought this many times in the past year or so)"

Oddly enough, it's an old-ish Disney movie called ""Watcher in the Woods"".  For some reason my aunt and uncle rented it for me when I was spending the night with them.  I think I was maybe six?... ...and it <b>freaked me the hell out</b>.   (My guess is they figurd a Disney movie couldn't be too bad.)

My brain realizes that now it's not so,so scary... but I watched it a few years ago, and it still freaks me out.  It's scary with concepts, the power of the mind/collective people, and lack of trust.  Those movies are the ones that get me the most--even still.  The closer you get to ""it could happen"" the more it freaks me out.  Though, admittedly, my range of ""might happen"" may be a bit broader than most.

Don't get me wrong... ""The Ring"", ""Wrong Turn"", and any slasher film can make me jump and startle me.  But they don't make me scared when I curl up into my covers at night. 

Alllllthoughhh... that one girl that threw up in ""The Sixth Sense""... I had the damnedest time getting her out of my head.  Dunno why."

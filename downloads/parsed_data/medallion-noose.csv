im tryin to figure out what it is i'm suppose to do with the plate i was dished out. theres sumthin specifically i think i should do but i'm not absolutely positive so i dont think im gonna tell...

i havent tlked to my family members today. not full conversations anyway. the only way im writing this is bc NOONE is home. bc they leave and dont tell me where they r going. last nite i felt ignored so today im doing it rite bak to them. especially my mom. even though today we r going to celebrate my moms raise from work, i dont care. 

last nite i said mom, phone. and she didnt reply and i was like RIte by her so i figure hmm, maybe she fell asleep..? so i look at her n she just ignored me so i go mom, PHone.. and she looks at me and takes it bc im rite on her face.. im like yea fuck u too. i felt ignored. and i think thats what it is that truly gets to me bc i had this overwhelming feeling of disgust n i just didnt wanna tlk to them. she apologized after church. i walked on. she said ""forgiven?"" and i stared straight ahead. im still making up my mind if she is.

yea. i've been havin thoughts of so much and its a lot believe me so i decided to spill sum over here .

i'll see u in skool or sumthin. u can comment if you'd like, though i doubt it."

I'm getting so sad now.. i gots trish here being sick and it puts her down so in turn i fall and i feel so powerless, so inefficient... so unable to help.. i <3 her so much and it gets me so down to see her like this and i cant do anything.. if we could wish on things believe, i wouldnt wish for much.. i'd just wish for her... when i cant see her in skool its like a part of me missing and to see her hold herself in pain when she does and to see her fight it gets me so down that i can't say anything  about it.. all i do is sit and wish it away.. such a strong, loving person should not have to endure such bad experiences that turn into bad memories of younger days.. she should b livin it up, spendin time in skool where she belongs but all that happens is pain and all i can do is sit and watch.

<P>1.i am just gonna try to keep friends, and with this i won't try any harder than the other person. <BR>2. i will forget about certain people. i dont seem to be gaining any positive or just, good vibes from some people so, to make their lives better and easier, i'll dissapear out of these lives i speak of. (sigh) i just feel kinda, <EM>used</EM>.<BR></P>
<P>now lets see.. on the UP side (there should always be at least 1 upside in all thats bad) is that my dearest has returned and i am extremely overjoyed. Also i am looking for job stuffs and <EM>maybe </EM>i'll work at chuck E cheeses. haha </P>
<P>and uhh, i also have recently gotten interested into a certain series by Tom Clancy. Net Force.. its REALLY great. i like the one that i'm reading, i just started reading it yesterday, and i'm almost done. woo. i should rele get started on the required reading though. (blah)<BR></P>

(she was serious) my uncle (godfather) says: u r such a pollack. ha! HIS wife (who isnt polish) goes come on i would go bowling too. he looks at her and says: ur such a pollack too. ha.so i ended up going bowling at 9:30 at nite. got home at 12:45. all was well.

i am lost.

i'm losing  myself.
i'm tryin to find a way out but all i see are road blocks and detours. i'm tryin so hard not to 1. contradict myself, 2. lose anything, 3. LOSE MY MIND.


PS. i never said u were a liar. i never came out and said,""dont listen to her, she's a liar."" i indeed contradicted what u said but i never actually called u a liar. that is all, i'm giving up on trying more bc it seems useless. i seem to not be a good person in ur eyes and supposedly changed or w/e but i'm the same person, i always have been, i made one mistake that i have never made b 4 and now i am diff to u.. i dont kno.

<P>i try to help people, i get slapped in the face</P>
<P>i try to have fun with pple, i ruin the nite it seems</P>
<P>i try to love, i mess up and slip n fall</P>
<P>i try to give, and people make it look like i'm taking</P>
<P>i try to stay friends, i get&nbsp;slapped again&nbsp;</P>
<P>i try to hug, but they only leave me air</P>
<P>i try to draw, my pictures come out pretty good</P>
<P>i cry, and nobody's listening. nobody cares. (ally i kno u do..)&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=7>WTF?!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>ally u were rite. last summer was the shit. this one, is just....shit. everything sucks. all except for me meeting mark. thats the only thing that keeps this summer being slightly better then last summer. last summer was the greatest i've had. people seem more mature last summer than they do this summer. nobody became biff(ally) with&nbsp;a particular person. we were&nbsp;ALL chill. i dunno what can be so different. y it couldnt end up the same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=4>&nbsp;~can somebody NEW make my summer better? BEFORE it's over? i will love you forever, i swear...~ <FONT color=#000000 size=3>(dont worry ally, i stil &lt;3 u)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>~~~~~~~i dont even want to try anymore. when i argue my side i'm always being contradicted by someone. theres always someone there thinking that they can say sumthin to prove me wrong so i mean i have A SHITLOAD of stuff to say but all that will happen is i wont be listened to and no one will REALLY take into account what i say.(except for ally)~~~~~~~~~~ </P>
<P>so i leave you all with this: i'm deffinately done. from now on, i will try all i can to save things but not go out of my way for it bc that wound b pointles. if i'm the only one trying, then i will just say screw it. summer is about having fun, staying biff (ally, again) with all that i went biff into summer with, and having maybe summer flings but not be deserted by pple... summers about&nbsp;FUN, not having to patch things up on a weekly bases.. jeez..</P>
<P>i was sitting on my couch (the recliner IN my ROOM)&nbsp;and i could think was ""ahh jebus!! what can i do?? jeeeebuuus!""</P>
<P>haha, yea.... so i am being the same person i have always been and&nbsp;particular pple&nbsp;have lost the part of me that that cares more than it should. </P>
<P>i bid u all farewell for now, and giveth you my blessings for a safe travel amongst your individual journey. good day.</P>"

"event","<P>I walked into the place with my dad and thought of turning around for a moment. All the faces looked at me and thought i may have been just another one of those preps that comes in to get their lower back done. No, that wasn't me though. I had something else in mind. A dragon. All black, nothing too complicated, unlike my fathers. His was indeed smaller though, and near his hip. Mine,&nbsp;I decided, will be put in my lower left leg. </P>
<P>I went up to the first burly, tough looking guy that worked there and told him about my appointment. As he walked behind the counter, he asked me what it was&nbsp;I had in mind, and I reached for the picture in my pocket. I unfolded it with care and nervousness. He noticed the intense look in my eye and told me that the first one is always the hardest but it won't be too bad. Believe it or not, that made me feel a heck of a lot better. He told me to follow him, and sat me down in a chair as he studied the photo. </P>
<P>Before&nbsp;I knew it,&nbsp;I had one leg up, more elevated than the rest of me, and I was lying back as if I was just laying around, nothing to worry about.&nbsp;What seemed to be out of nowhere was this pinching feeling&nbsp;which&nbsp;told me he had started.&nbsp;My dad, smiling a warm smile, told me to calm down a little and that it will all eventually be done with. &nbsp;I smiled back and decided i would not let a tear drop. As the stinging went on, i thought hard about anything other than the odd burning sensation i felt on my lower leg. It was new to me, but somehow made me feel better. I felt good. I liked it. I closed my eyes for a little while, feeling the needle and every time it made another permanent stain on my body. I looked up at the man doing this for me, and he stopped for a moment, admired his work, glanced at my face, and gave me a sure smile of reassurance. </P>
<P>He finished up the last spot, and told me to stay like that so he can put this special bandage on it. He said to keep it on for as long as possible to keep my new piece of body art from developing any type of infection. I made sure of it. He then told me that if anything were to look like it was not finished or if&nbsp;I found a flaw, to come back and let him know. I thanked him for everything and as&nbsp;I walked outside with my dad, i surrounded him in a big, heartfelt hug. I kept thanking him for taking me and allowing me to do this. Now, after what seemed to be countless hours, I took a peek at it and decided I had the bandage on for long enough, and my leg wanted to breathe. I think I'll rebandage it later. This is it.</P>

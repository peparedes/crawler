"event","why is it that when you need the most help
people say the exact opposite of what you really need to hear?

fuck you, shut up, and help me
the same way i'd do for you, you fucking idiot of a person

yeah, i planned every bit of the last two weeks to happen just as it has
oh and yes, i am totally enjoying being broke without a cent, without fucking money to get lunch or dinner
a cat with two gashes in his neck with what was 10 stitches
vet bills up the ass, along with dentist bills with their ""we're fucking idiots"" insurance policy
oh and above all else, i've been dying to be at your mercy for so long
i cut my own brake line to make it possible

as peaceful as i try to be
and as peaceful as i'd like my life to be
something happens to kill all of my accomplishments
and brings me back to that ugly, depressed little girl
without a god damn hope in the world
i'm sorry i have to ask you for help, fucker, believe me, i'd sell my body for the money
if i wasnt entirely afraid of older men
FUCK YOU.

wish me luck, i'll be driving a car with no brakes
to a mechanic that has no idea i'm coming

if i make it"

No mo' depression.
No mo' guy problems- i just say fuck it.
I do suffer from extreme anxiety attacks
and I can't eat food because my stomach wants to throw it up
lol, anxiety is a bitch and comes out of no where
can anyone hook me up with some zanex and/or painkillers?
they help me.
I weigh a healthy 105 :-)
BUT I'm fine! lol
I should be a vegetarian,
considering my ""i dont want to digest anything"" stomach
bobE, any suggestions?"

Your birth on the 16th day of the month gives a sense of loneliness and generally the desire to work alone. 

You are relatively inflexible, and insist on your being independent. 

You need a good deal of time to rest and to meditate. 



You are introspective and a little stubborn. 

Because of this, it may not be easy for you to maintain permanent relationships, but you probably will as you are very much into home and family. 

This birth day inclines to interests in the technical, the scientific, and to the religious or the unknown realm of spiritual explorations. 



The date gives you a tendency to seek unusual approaches and makes your style seem a little different and unique to those around you. 

Your intuition is aided by the day of your birth, but most of your actions are bedded in logic, responsibility, and the rational approach. 

You may be emotional, but have a hard time expressing these emotions. 

Because of this, there may be some difficulty in giving or receiving affection.</td>

am i the only one that wakes up out of sleep directly into an anxiety attack?
i wake up thinking about brian fucking other girls and how he pretty much threw me away
heart starts racing
breathing quickens
you feel like crying
and puking
and ripping his tongue out all at once
your heart feels like its been melted
and thrown inside your stomach to burn the lining


i'm hurt
i dont know what to do
i want to curl up and cuddle with him
but i know in the back of his mind
he wants to go out and get drunk and fuck as many girls as he can
but always have me to call is he's got a boring night to fill
i want to tell him how i feel
is it too late, has he already moved on?
will i lose him for good, just like jose?
when i told jose i cared about him, he dropped me so fast and so hard
i'm expecting it a second time
after all, marci doesn't have any real feelings, look, she's just fucking psycho
acccording to jose, i'm cute but psycho

why do i love the people that always cause me harm more than anything?
maybe its because i know they may need it
and i want to give it
but then they always turn around stabbing me 
right in the god damn heart
and it takes me <b><i>FOREVER</b></i> to get over shit like that

brian, why do you have to do such stupid shit
when if you even gave me a chance, we would have so much fun together"

i cant avoid thinking of you
i've tried, because it makes me sad when i do
and i know that you're so far away

down almost every street in this town
we've done something stupid
we even threw up in some of these dark parking lots
what about the park, and floating docks, when i tried to be a raccoon
i even avoided looking at the fountain
i looked the opposite way only to see the refection of it off of the mirror like wall
its amazing
hey, what about drum circle park
haha, oh wait, i dont think you're allowed there
we flew kites
whenever i drive towards ft pierce
i think of you when i see that lighthouse thing on the side of the road
and i'd always say ""we're almost to the bus station!""
and how could i forget our walmart friends
planned parenthood

it makes me sad because all the stuff we used to do,
i do alone
i go to the river and go to that tree
yeah, i do
i look for hermies and crabs
i walk what's left of the pier
i think about stealing those damn rocking chairs
jensen beach makes me tear up <i>every</i> fucking time i go there

i know i'm over emotional
but sometimes man
i just want you to be in leilani heights
and me on silver maple road
and we'll meet at the church, ok?
yeah, i'll see you in a minute



dont take your best friend for granted
there's absolutely no replacing him/her
and you're left with the emptiness"

i jogged/walked Indian Riverside Park (all the way around the premises- on the sidewalk)
8 times
in between laps i'd run up and down the flight of stairs a couple of times
its invigorating
i didnt want to stop but... it was getting dark 
i like to be alone a lot now
and i like to be alone and jog, its mind soothing
more so than ciggies
A LOT MORE SO

i'm eating my bbq chicken and salad now

i cant wait till this tooth is fixed, dear __________ in the sky, help me :-("

"event","I'm officially the worst mother in the world
this is why i dont want kids
because look what happens to my pets
really shitty fucked up things.
no, i shall never be a real mother.

i had an eventful night tonight
i went to the beach for an hour or two and watched the storm abrewin'
i went home, jogged for about 35 minutes around the neighborhood
went back home to do exercises and start laundry
my gerbils were exceptionally active, as was jude
freckle noticed, i yelled at him that he knows better to watch the gerbils
i started laundry and when i went to get the second load, i noticed the cage
the gerbil cage
it was upsided down on the floor
i looked at freckle and saw him batting Leona
i instantly picked him up by his neck and threw him into the hallway wall
and yelled profusely
i ran to leona and picked her up
it was too late
she had to have just passed because she was so warm
and i could have sworn i felt a heart beat
i tested to see if she was breathing, she was not
i said ""gia, where are you?""
and gia popped her head up from behind her wooden house inside the mangled cage

i feel so bad
Leona's death is my responsibility
could you imagine a huge giant flipping your house upside down
and just so happen the door popped open 
you stick her head out to see what happend
and the giant breaks your neck
and your best friend just watched you die
i couldn't handle it
and if gia dies because of this traumatic experience, i dont blame her

i  laid Leona in the cage so Gia could see what happend
and Gia licked her face :-(

i buried Leona in the back yard
i made freckle apoligize
i brought him to the gravesite and made him put his paw on it
but he jumped out my arms and rolled on his back across the grave
it was wierd
i know it is his instinct but HE KNOWS BETTER
and he knows he did something bad
because everytime i walk by him i give him my death stare
and he puts his ears down, crouches and runs away"

"event","i woke up wanting to do nothing but puke all over myself

i had a dream about pictures
i got mail from someone i did not know
actually, three people in the room got mail
i had good feelings about them but they were strangers to me
i had three blank envelopes so i distributed them randomly
they didnt tell me what was in their envelopes... 
but my mail included those fuzzy seeing eye pictures, and a roll of film
and i usually can never see anything in those
because i already have a bad eye
and i just cant see what's cool about them
i never know what the secret message is
but in the dream i did
but they weren't cool pictures
they were of a family i didn't know
and it was really creepy
the main picutures i remember are:
a baby in a sewer hole
a dark alley
an ariel shot of two brick walls and a small path in between, and it spun

the roll of of film was even creepier
it was of three people getting on make up
it showed step by step this whole prosetic (i know i spelled that horribly wrong) face
and one of them had a lady holding a sign reading ""do you want to know what all this means?""
and the next picture was the most fucked up face you could imagine
straight out of a god damn nightmare, and that's exactly what it came from
and this beast had another sign that said ""you're going to die""
when i woke up i knew where they were
they were in my old new jersey house, in that small ass kitchen we had
i remember seeing the window that looked into the back yard
where my mom would watch us play
and there was always a tomato in the window

as soon as i saw the pictures
i ran to a door in this house i've never been to
and it had a door above the window
i looked out
and saw a dark ocean
with a star soaked sky
and i screamed for brian
because i knew he had gone to the beach
but it just got darker the more i screamed for him

so i woke up panicing
my heart was racing, it still is
my gag reflex was in ""ON"" mode
it was bad
and i feel so fucking scared
then i thought of tracey moving to washington
and man, i just dont understand life
i just dont
why do the people that i love the most have to leave
pick someone else you god damn thing called living
now we cant finish growing up together
i cant know she'll be here in the next 2 hours that it would take her to drive to stuart from orlando
now she's going to be across the god damn US
i dont get used to things easy
and this time especially is no different

now i have to develop all thos pictures i have in my car
my god i hope they are not expired
they probably are
i'm so stupid for never developing them
oh god i'm so dumb
its my only way of remembering how much fun we had
and it just sits in my car
because i have no god damn money

oh man, i'm going to take a vicodin 
because its obviously the only thing thats gonna chill me out"

i had ""crunched"" (thats what it feels like) my tooth
oh man, it was unbearable
so i immediately went to the dentist
where they could have either pulled my tooth or root canaled it
so i picked root canal
but they only did half
i have a temporary filling in now, which is already starting to deteriorate
it only lasts max 4 weeks
so i have to pay the other $740 to finish my tooth
i made a payment plan with them but it would take 2 months, i need this tooth fixed in 2 weeks
where the fuck do i come up with that much money in that short period of time?
my tooth hurts now.

people cant control me

and people who are jealous are vicious
and you have to be a strong enough person to say

wade and i got in a huge argument
mainly because he lost his power struggle (which was in his head) with me
i have more confidence
i have more self respect
i'm honest with everything in my life
and he's jealous
so he blew up on me
and i laughed in his pathetic face 
because thats what he is: pathetic
he's going nowhere with his life
because he does not have enough confidance in anything in his life
not even enough confidance to say what he needs to say when he needs to say it
so hes a fucking loser

michelle and i tried to help a lady tonight who we thought was getting abused
or was in dire need of a way out of the situation she was in
but little did we know how intoxicated she was
she almost passed out in michelles car
we had to keep her awake
she couldnt even talk coherently
so michelle called the cops
the cop came and finally the ambulance
they took her away to a detox facility for alcoholics in PSL
i was fighting with this lady to hold her up
so she wouldnt almost get hit by a car in the middle of US 1
i tried my hardest to control her but it was useless
she pulled my arm down with her when she fell
and now my shoulderblade to my elbow hurts
kinda pinching
i hope she didnt do serious damage
but i feel bad for her
knowing there's people out there that need that much alcohol, or any substance, to feel better
but they only feel worse
and find themselves behind bars when they wake up
i feel for her
and hope to god she'll have enough self respect to get over such a nasty habit
good luck, lisa, i'll always think of you

i'm going to bed now
i have no idea what time i have to be at work

overall, i wish people would be openminded enough to give ME a chance
i'm not weak at all
but that doesnt mean i'll hurt you
because i dont want to hurt anyone
but i always end up doing so 
because people expect the worse from me
and when i feel so many negative vibes and see so many disgusted facial expressions
i use my fucking crab claws
and tear a whole in the weakest part of your life

more than other friends have
losing you cuts deep
real deep

but i have to                                              pick up corina at between 230 and 3pm
by the way the above spaces are from razzle, he hopped off of my lap onto the keyboard... now he's somewhere behind the printer
hahaha
i love him
he gets into so much micheif (SP?!)
i like bunnies... well, this one
they usually scare me but raz is an exception
although i swear he tried to attack my neck like the one in monty python

"event","last night was one of the most eventful nights i have had in a long time

alexis, tracey, corina and i went to club kashmir. (charlie- you didn't come. bastard <3 ). the bouncer guy even gave me a bracelet which allowed me to drink, but then noticed that i was only 18 (i think he was drunk) and ripped it off and gave me some sort of abnormal smiley face on my right hand. we started off playing pool and air hockey. i am the champion air hockiest (WHAT?!) lol.

waited for the drag show... and waited... and waited... and waited...

finally about 1am we started dancing...

an hour and a half later, the drag show came on. they did a few pieces from greece. it was cute, but only one performance.

we were dirty nasty sweaty girls on the dance flo'. lol. then tracey fell in a puddle while dancing. i landed on top of her. we laughed hysterically and then i went into a coughing fit and thought i was going to vomit so i ran to the bathroom. while trying to cool off by throwing water on each other, the lady selling random bathroom necessities showed us a picture of a dominican guy's penis, saying it was as long as from the bottom of her fingertips to the beginning of her shoulder. oh my.

we (me and tracey) then just <i>had</i> to dance on the big wooden boxes (the speakers)above everyone to show off our special moves. since the bass was so loud, we almost fell off of those. then we danced on the lower boxes with alexis and corina cause they were being to shy. hehe...
THEN we all danced on the stage... well, me and tracey did... alexis and corina just laughed at us :-).

we wanted to dance forever but we were <i>totally</i> exhausted and tired.

we finally left about 3:30am or 3:45am. had to drop corina off at home in the pizzle. alexis and i finally made it home about 5am. 

i had to work at 12today. did a party for a very unappreciative oriental lady. man, she was high maintience (sp?). but she did give me $10 even though 10% of a $200 bill would be $20 but whatev, i still got sumpin!"

That pissed me off, hardcore, without a doubt, PISSED me off. My heart goes in this journal, I write everything in it, and for fucks like that to be reading in on what's going on in my life, fuck it, it's over, not gonna happen anymore. 

I'm not mad Kelly, I just don't want Derek knowing my business and my emotions. You should know how much this journal means to me and how it's been an outlet for most of my frustrations, and since it has a restricted reading list, you let someone I didn't want reading it... to read it. I'm not mad. Not at all. It's just not cool.

Toby has buck teeth and is starring at me
But it is ok b/c it makes me feel free.
His teeth are so distorded and twisted
When he barks we all get a little misted.
Sometimes when i am mad i hit him with my fist
but then i feel bad and give him a kiss.
Someday i will get him doggy braces
But for now he will just have to get all those faces
of disgusted looks and sprays mase-es.
I do feel bad for Toby, i must say
if i could shoot him i think i may.
Toby has buck teeth and is starring at me
But it is okay b/c he makes me feel free...
 
2) <u>My foot is painfully itching</u>

My foot is painfully itching 
I really wish it would stop
If it doesn't stop soon I may beat if with a mop.
Now it is all pussey and filled with white goo
It is so big it cant fit in my shoe.
I cannot stop itching my foot you see
I dont even stop when i go pee.
The pain is unbearable and soon it will pop
Then i will clean it up with that mop.
Now it feels better and the goo is all gone
I kinda miss that wonderfull itch, i want it back mon
So i shall scratch and scratch until it comes back
I misses that lil painfull scratch.
It hurts so bad, I think it's infected
My itch doesn't like me- I feel rejected..
Good GO AWAY- I dont want you here! 
That's right,the itch is all gone and now my foot is clear.
No more painful foot itch
It left me, that lil' bitch!

3) <u> I gave Toby a Dorito </u>
I gave Toby a Dorito, and he loved it so, 
now he's staring at me, i want him to go, 
big black eyes, no beginning and no end, 
fucking hampster dog you are my friend.
Yes he has twisted teeth, and his breath is rank
But i love him still, even tho his head is blank.
I just gave you one dorito, that is no reason to stay
Why don't you just get the fuck away!!!
I really get angry at this fucking oversized cat
I just want to skin him and use him as a mat.
how funny is that,
it would be a 2x2 mat, if that!
The dog is real small, yes smaller than that,
Yes god dammit, smaller than a bat..
GET THE FUCK AWAY dark eyed dog
you are starring at me as if i were one dorito log
I am not, and no, you can not eat me
NOW beat it before i beat you with my boney knee!!!"

I'm kinda let down though cause I DONT KNOW WHY but I thought Bam Margera was going to be there... I'm an idiot, cause he's not. I was looking forward to him but now I'll just watch them look cute on their skateboards cause the only ones I know of are all from Tony Hawk Proskater 1-4 on ps2. LOL. Oh well.

I'm confused, it's just going to be me and Jules the WHOLE trip... What do I say today? How do I act? I'm more excited and nervous about the car ride with Jules than BBHJ... IS THAT BAD? It's like a god damn first date... gotta look cute... gotta smell pretty... AAHHH!!! I want my baby back!!!!!! But yeah, I need that damn CD Tracey, I'll call you later when I know for sure you're wakie... hehehe

Once Alexis goes to work, I will be working on the fattest joint I have ever rolled to smoke with Jules. I can't do very big ones at all but I'll be home alone soon enough and will have plenty of time and patience to work on it.

He still feels bad.......... I guess that's a good thing cause it was only a couple days ago, I don't want him to forget me THAT fast, right? Stupid selfish Marci.

My mom said to tell Jules ""I am not a toy. My emotions and feelings aren't supposed to be smashed everytime you change your mind and need to ""think"". No love is worth all this heartbreak and torture, that's not a relationship, it's a war. So if you do this again, it's over, forever, as much as it hurts to say but if you're going to be fickle and not consider anyone else's emotions it's not gonna work out because I don't deserve these horrible feelings."" Kinda harsh but if he comes back expecting me to to except his apology after all he's put me through without a second thought, he's gonna hear the lecture but maybe he will actually be smart next time......IF there is a next time.... god I hope there's a next time and he knows what the fuck he's doing....

I'm going to torture Jules with Mariah Carey on Sunday. All who talk to him should prepare him, LOL! Oh yeah, Janvier/Michelle, you thought you had it bad last night? OOOOOOOH man, he's gonna know all the words by Sunday night, hehehehehe!!! Tracey, I need to borrow your CD?? please??

Jules said his flowers were very nice, and he got the note too... he even put his flowers in a vase, how cute. He said he loved me last night when he called me too. I like when he says it first, gives me a purpose, gives me importance knowing I'm not a TOTAL reject. haha.

"event","...for some cheap Nikon lenses to put on an adaptor I might buy for my camera. In any case, I came across this one lens I want to get even though it has no real details written about it in the ""for sale"" post. Instead, the seller put the following:

<lj-cut text=""Hawaii is so wacky"">


(I have not reformatted this in any way, it's just as densely squeezed on the ebay page under a generic picture of a lens facing forward)

This auction is for a used Nikon Nikkor HC 50mm f2 lens in excellent condition, no scratches or fungus on lens elements. The overall look of the black paint is excellent with wear through on sharp edges and corners. The lens focuses very smoothly and viewing through the magnifying light I see very tiny spects of dust internally in the lens elements which don't show up on the photos. Apparently these lenses were very sharp, please see example of enlarged photo of my El Camino on the newspaper front page (this is not the way to become famous) look at the last three digits 148 of my El Camino license plate that the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper photographer Ken Sakamoto perfectly framed (he and his assistant photographer just happened to be in the area?, they also digitally enhanced the numbers 148 so it would stand out and could be clearly read by the average reader but still the lens displays extreme sharpness), it will be used in a book about State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, GEICO and Island Insurance Company and the extent to which they will go put a stop-to and also get the upper-hand on claimants. These insurance companies conspired and worked with the State of Hawaii deputy attorney general Lawrence Goya and his two female assistants (who were also caught on video tape while seated together laughing at statements I made to a judge during a court hearing) to drive a state registered vehicle at high speed head-on and cut across my El camino's path in an attempt to run me and my mother off the road hoping I would become enraged, behave recklessly and chase down the vehicle in hot pursuit only to run into the the waiting hands of police. Attempted murder and wreckless endangering is the only way that I can describe it. This traffic stop was made for not using a seat belt but as you can see the insurance companies conspired together and arranged to have this staged photo of me in my El Camino stopped by Honolulu police officers William Baldwin at my driver's door and William Axt positioned in the background pointing a lazer gun at traffic which was printed on the front page of the local newspaper to discredit me because of a pending personal injury case in which their insured were defendants. With the help of Colbert M. Matsumoto (remember him the court appointed master for Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate when trustees and tax exempt status of the trust were on trial) owner of Island Insurance Companies who is also now on the board of directors of the local Star-Bulletin newspaper, they arranged with the cooperation of the Honolulu Police Department and Chief Lee Donohue to pose for photographers as if they were stopping me for speeding. The insurance companies were going to present this newspaper front page headline Fast and Deadly with story and photos to convince a jury at my trial that I am a wreckless driver even though their insured admitted fault in every case. Colbert M. Matsumoto and Duane K. Kurisu corporate officers now investing and diverting Island Insurance Companies policy holders reserves into their own private ventures: Foremost Dairies properties, Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Aloha Airlines etc. with the approval of a federal bankruptcy judge. The scheme works like this: if the investment goes sour it's Island Insurance Companies and policy holder's investment and reserves, if the investment is good and profitable it's their personal investment and profits. Policy holders reserves are systematically being funneled out and looted, all partners (the more partners the better, in a criminal investigation it's harder to pinpoint the fault, everyone points to each other) in crime share in the take. Island Insurance Companie's books need to be audited by the current Insurance Commissioner, if he has the guts but he may also be a party to the scheme. A federal investigative panel please, no state investigation, after all, these are the same people that confirm the Insurance Commissioner. There is a new Island Insurance Companie's president (previous president Linda Gilchrist told someone near to us that she had her fill with the lying and cheating of policyholders by directors, insiders and investors) now who quickly got initiated by board members (Colbert M. Matsumoto and other insiders) who have been busy changing, coaching and falsifying testimony from bribed witnesses in exchange for favors such as untraceable opportunities (other forms of money, such as travel, vacations, scholarships-we are still trying to verify and pinpoint the scholarships because apparently some are out of state). Could Hamilton McCubbin also be an investor or silent partner in these schemes? Remember, he was handed a $400,000.00 settlement to resign by board of director Colbert M. Matsumoto (he seems to only be on boards that have large amounts of money, I wonder why?) in the Kamehameha Schools female co-worker abuse-affair scandle, this is just another way money is looted from the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate Trust. There are a lot of on the job opportunities that are taken advantage of and secret extra marital affairs that go on at the Kamehameha Schools administration department, just drop in on your mate unannounced, it's a hotbed of activity. Ladies do you know where your husbands are? or men do you know where your wives are? In light of what happened to Plaintiff Appellant, would it still be appropriate for a state regulated local insurance company owner and executive who bought interest and influence in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper to stay vested and not violate any Federal Antitrust Laws such as the Sherman Act? Sorry that you had to read this but these ideal photos that I am using are the only good examples that I had to demonstrate how sharp the lens performs on a tripod at approx. 36 inches where the license plate numbers printed in the newspaper looked like a smuge to me. If you want to see more photos please see my other auctions later during the following weeks where I will be offering some insight and dated stamped copies of court records, registered letters and documents that will form the basis of the book ""State Rape - government officials including judges, legislators, city prosecutors making their bones"" to advance their careers, including falsified court documents, not filed or missing depositions incriminating insurance companies, motions and court records that are date stamped and appear out of thin air after the fact (which is it haunted house or court house?), and Supreme Court appeal No. 24554 all are public records now that the case is over? Copies will be offered at reasonable prices for educational purposes (all law students in Hawaii need to read this to understand the initiation process before receiving a license to practice law in the State of Hawaii) and a look a the connection of this case (Calvin J.H. Chun - State Farm Insurance Company defendant who was impossible to find and serve with any court papers related in some way to Dr. Chun president of  Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate?) to the new book ""Broken Trust"" which may need some clarification in the roles that certain characters are made out to play. In my book ""State Rape - Making Their Bones"" I tell it like it is, learn why insurance companies use government officials, common criminals, convicted felons, whores, prostitutes (recruited and blackmailed under age decoy prostitutes are exploited and used by insurance companies looking for a reason and a way to deny a claim, are these prostitutes qualified and certified to test thoes with back injury claims? I guess if you are an insurance company you can makeup your own rules) and other riffraff or what ever works for insurance companies at the time to crush and discredit claimants. Insurance companies are now knowingly and deliberately letting their hired contractors and investigators recruit (using third party contractors, this way if caught insurance companies will deny that they never knew decoys or prostitutes were under age, this could be your daughter being used by insurance companies, aren't you glad insurance companies have a license to kill and destroy? This certainly is disturbing, if you care do something about it.) under age female decoy prostitutes to entrap personal injury claimants. Who interviews and approves these young under age female decoys or prostitutes, insurance executives and managers working with local police? God help us. I believe yes they do it's a dream come true for them, what do they have in store for policy holders next. This attitude is spilling over into other forms of insurance products such as health insurance, where your premiums are gladly taken but you have to get a lawyer to get them to pay your serious medical bills (minor bills are usually paid without a fight it makes the show look good), if you can't afford a lawyer then they won't pay or bother talking to you and treat you as a nuisance claim or someone trying to rip them off. State Farm insured hurricane Katrina victims good luck in getting any repairs done to your home in a timely manner if at all, this insurance company will stall and wait you out (they will insist that it is flood damage or termites?) if you are really lucky they might toss you a bone to chew on. Just ask any hurricane Andrew victims or Northridge earthquake victims of the past how they were treated. One of the worst fears facing the elderly today is health insurance, after all you've paid in or been promised will it be there when you need it, from what I can see it will be like the social security system is now the money will be borrowed, diverted, transferred, badly invested, stolen or funneled out to accomplices, only ten cents on the dollar will be left there for policy holders if we're lucky. HealthSouth Corp. CEO Richard Scrushy is an example and the same thing is happening in Hawaii at this very moment. Why do you think insurance companies are rushing to sign you up and to give you low cost drug coverage now, what they are not telling you is that when the time comes the reserves won't be there for your serious medical treatments and long term care because insurance companies and their executives with the help of politicians and others will have used it all up (they think with the use of drugs today they can head off any long term disabling conditions, that way they will never have to come up with the large reserves of money that they won't have). The widespread full impact of this hasen't happened yet but if the future predicted condition of social security program is any indication the money for your health care won't be there when the time comes. You can pick any personal injury lawyer that you want, some have a good show and presentation, but it won't matter because after all the song and dance is over and you have already hired them most lawyers know to well what the outcome of your case will generally be and if they make too many waves with the insurance company they will receive a spanking and be put back in their place (insurance companies convince lawyers who's the boss buy stonewalling all their cases, the smart lawyers get the message quick and begin to play ball at your expense). Insurance companies and their friends in the legislature are always coming up with new scams for the public, it's the same old products just with a new name and twist, Underinsured Motorists U I M or Uninsured Motorists U M, very few people ever collect and the companies know this, it's guaranteed money in their pockets. This new angle was dreamed up after current changes in the law and countless appeals put the odds on the insurance companies side, even if all else fails and a verdict goes against them they appeal and wait you out, by then you may be bankrupt. Even politicians and news people who know what's good for them get the message and if they don't they will quickly be put in their place and spanked if insurance companies are unhappy with them, remember they control the purse strings (your hard work and your money). Lawyers commercials on TV can be misleading and depict insurance company investigators as spies that are waiting in the shadows to catch unsuspecting injured claimants in the act of being themselves (and one commercial in particular in the case of a claimant only using crutches to get around when out in public), our inside person who plays both sides of the fence tells us that insurance companies rarely hire or spend money to investigate this type of claim (our claim and others where there are substantial losses are the exception) because they have already decided in house on a settlement amount (nothing you do will change that, judges already know this and if they don't very shortly they would no longer be judges, if you want drama and a show and make enough noise you might even have a staged trial, the outcome would probably be the same, the game is rigged ask any carnival geek). Chances are that your claim file will just sit in a stack in your lawyers office along with countless others and most attorneys know beforehand that they will not spend any investigative money on your case. There are few exceptions, but remember it's like any other business protecting their bottom line, why burn the midnight oil on your case when plaintiff's attorneys will be hammered by the insurance company who will appeal and appeal and appeal. Attorneys are in business and have rent to pay and other cases pending, the insurance companies will wear them down and bankrupt you if they have to. The majority of claimants have only been compensated for 10 to 15 percent of their losses and injuries and most lawyers know this but are anxious to move on to the next case. They are tired of banging their heads up against a solid wall (the system is rigged), if you feel that you were shorted go back and see them and demand restitution, make a lot of noise. Our inside person also tells us that the above insurance companies with the help of bribed legislators, attorney generals, city prosecutor and HPD have all banned together to stop me from getting the word out that ""the system is rigged"" and to get the goods on me even if they have to make a federal case out of me spitting on the sidewalk. If you fall for one of their hookers, they will even use it to break up your family and marriage unless you agree to their token settlement, they don't care how injured you are (nice people?). All this fuss is not about you or me or our claims, we are just in the way, all they want out of us is pay the premiums. It's all about stealing policy holder's reserves and I believe that the above mentioned insurance companies are doing a good job of it, the big question is where are the reserves or have most of the money been stolen or funneled out of these companies by now. See for the first time published photos of staged and planned insurance company inspections (signed and dated by State Farm's claim's representative Kip Okinaka) of their insured's vehicle after front end repairs are completed to support falsified court documents filed claiming that their insured's vehicle had very little or no damage (in my case this contradicts the official police report so how can they be liable and be sued for any damages to the rear of plaintiff's car). Some of the principal characters in my book will include former governor Ben Cayatano and his new house on the hill and how it relates to Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate, federal magistrate Kevin S.C. Chang, federal judge David Ezra and disbarred attorney Jonathan J. Ezer now a convicted felon and what they have in common, supreme court justice Nakayama, governor Linda Lingle, lieutenant governor Duke Aiona knowingly conspired with a convicted felon while on the bench, tape recorded meeting with Micah Kane former chairman of the Hawaii republican party, city prosecutor Peter Carlisle conspirator now running for congress, former HPD chief Lee Donohue and detective Robert Chinen who refused to proceed with theft investigation even after detective Chinen admitted that attorney Charles J. Ferrera (AKA CJF) lied to him during the limited investigation, HPD officer W. Tom at receiving desk refused to file complaint report after receiving phone call from HPD chief Lee Donohue, KITV-4 news reporter Mary Zanakas witness at HPD receiving desk (also other news personel who were bribed or threatened to keep quiet, what is this world coming too!), Bruce G. Soll M.D. my asthma physician and his nurse who started giving me the run-around trying to fill my prescriptions and sometimes my prescriptions were cut-off when I arrived at pharmacy, Maurice W. Nicholson M.D. State Farm's IME doctor (non board certified) unethically contacted defendant's attorneys for information about the case (we were informed that he can even workup an independant medical examination report about a claimant's present condition from a helicopter in the air several hundred feet above with his hands tied behind his back and blindfolded, amazing what else is next? Most doctors want you to at least present yourself and be in the same room for the physical examination, but to be fair being in a helicopter several hundred feet above the patient is a slight improvement over BEI and CMR accident reconstruction experts who can makeup a medical report from several thousand miles away and never even see the patient), Ralph Rosenberg Court Reporters, Inc. knowingly and deliberately failed to file depositions with the court even after being contacted by registered letter to do so, defendant's attorney Nancy Ryan representing Island Insurance Company left in the middle of a scheduled deposition and refused to hear plaintiff complete his testimony-she said that she had a previous appointment, attorney Michael N. Tanoue (the Pacific Law Group formerly Matsumoto LaFountaine & Chow) endorses former colleague and former HPD assistant police chief Barbara Uphouse Wong to replace campaign spending commission executive director Bob Watada (suddenly Bob was in a hurry to retire just like HPD Chief Lee Donohue and Island Insurance Company president Linda Gilchrist), attorney Gerald Y. Sekiya chair Commission on Judicial Conduct, said he and others investigated judge Sabrina S. McKenna and could not find any judicial misconduct (currently this judge has a conflict of interest and presides on defendant and personal friend former governor John Waihee's trial-a former trustee of RightStar Hawaii Management Inc. where over 20 million dollars is missing from a trust account, by the way where did he get the money to pay off his house in Nuuanu that was in foreclosure?), judge Sabrina S. McKenna knowingly, willfully and deliberately conspired with convicted felon attorney Jonathan J. Ezer to extort settlement funds (knowing this fact a state legislator still encouraged her to seek another term, beware if you come before this politically appointed judge), judge Dexter D. Del Rosario deliberately and intentionally conspired with City Prosecutor Peter Carlisle to ignore my complaint, family court judge Karen M. Radius, former judge Gail Nakatani, judge Bert Isao Ayabe conspired with others to circumvent the jury selection process, First Circuit Court clerk H. Ching, Charles H. Hite assistant Office of Disciplinary Counsel, attorney Charles J. Ferrera (AKA CJF) theft of settlement funds and changed material facts in my interrogatories after I signed them, attorney Sidney J.Y. Wong (Wong & Oshima, Oshima's wife Mazie Hirono now running for congress?) retained and conspired with attorney Jonathan J. Ezer a convicted felon to take over my court case with attorney Rodd H. Yano and together falsified and altered my interrogatories, signature and date (formerly with Wong Oshima & Kondo), law offices of Koshiba Agena & Kubota, law offices of Leavitt Yamane & Soldner, attorney Ian A. Mattock (cooperated with defendant Sidney J.Y. Wong), Copolus Hoffman (cooperated with defendant Sidney J.Y. Wong), attorney Peter A. Howell (cooperated with defendant Sidney J.Y Wong), State Farm attorney Darren M. Suzuki who testified in judge Kevin S.C. Chang's courtroom that interrogatories he received from Wong Oshima & Kondo and Jonathan J. Ezer were materially different from a signed copy that I personally presented to the court (later Paut T. Yamamura and Carolyn Kiyota made him file a declaration in court denying it), Nuuanu YMCA, Wayne Arakaki former president of Island Insurance Company and a Nuuanu YMCA supporter (always willing to purchase new lockers for it's members), BEI Biodynamics Engineering, Inc. falsified medical reports and accident reconstruction, CMR Forensic Consultants falsified medical reports and accident reconstruction, Anthony J. Mauro neurologist Nuuanu YMCA member, Alan T. Basilio Island Insurance Co. claims representative knowingly filed falsified court papers, Kip Okinaka State farm claims representative knowingly falsified and covered up material evidense, Dale Mathews State Farm property damage appraiser knowingly falsified damage report to down play severity of collision impact (is there any wonder why some lawyers just lay down and play dead for insurance companies, in the book we tell you which attorneys in town to stay away from if you have a case), bribed next door neighbors, druggies and drug dealers (bribes in exchange for false testimony favoring the insurance company), in Hawaii corrupt public officials, police department and insurance companies bribed and gave false information to certain United States Postal Service employees, insurance company insiders and investors and who ever else is on the payroll is included in the book (for thoes interested I apologize if you can't find your name on this list but I'll be sure to include it in the book). Billions of dollars are owed to past claimants who were systematically cheated by the above mentioned insurance companies during the past two decades with falsified court documents and altered or missing depositions and interrogatories, (most claimants have no idea what has happened in their cases, this is the reason why most lawyers don't like to answer certain questions or return telephone calls from their clients) a great portion of the extorted money is used to support politicians who pass legislation favoring insurance companies and their policies. Also how insurance companies can put the squeeze (a gun to the head scenario, scrutinizing and questioning every billing presented by this doctor) on your doctor who gave them an adverse report favoring you the patient. Your doctor is pressured and responds by changing his report to suit the insurance company and by this time your doctor knows that he has to get rid of you as a patient and he starts by cutting off or reducing your medication refills and other harassment and you will soon realize that you have to find another doctor, we provide photo copies of this evidence in the book. As an example my long time asthma doctor Bruce G. Soll forced me out as a patient so now I can only get my asthma medications on the internet from countries such as Thailand, Pakistan and Brazil etc. Recently the United States Food and Drug Administration which is now under the the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security detained my asthma medication Theophylline so I sent copies of the Notice of  FDA Action letter and my response letter with attachments such as proof of asthma medication prescription refills from my doctor Bruce G. Soll to Attorney General Mark J. Bennett, Governor Linda Lingle and the Food and Drug Administration Compliance Officer Paul A. Peterson. FDA Compliance Officer Paul A. Peterson and Federal Judge David Ezra was contacted by Attorney General Mark J. Bennett and Governor Linda Lingle and was told to ignore me and my certified letter and send my medications back to where it came from, I was surprised by the reaction from judge Ezra whom I respected. A few days later the certified letter to the FDA was returned to me by the postal service and the reason: unclaimed and refused. By detaining my medications the FDA was just doing it's job (FDA dose spot checks and wanted to know if I had a prescription to use these medications), in the past I have received my medications with a FDA EXAMINED sticker and it said FORWARD TO ADDRESSEE, what is disturbing this time is the attorney general and others deliberately and intentionally influenced an FDA officer. What about the current state of alert at the borders to protect our national security from the threat of terrorists, do we now have a system where state officials play politics first, make up their own rules and fail to follow federal laws? We consider all the above parties, officials and representatives to some degree to be accomplices to attempted murder. Separate photo of my El Camino is used for comparison purposes only.

Don't even know what month that would be in, but I think if we haul it we can shoot the summer film with enough time to spare. 

Almost deleted my one quarter (in point of fact did) due to erasing the wrong folder. Thankfully I had the raw footage backed up to DVDs.

Jenn got a nasty virus and had to go to the hospital for dehydration. She's doing better now.

Hung around at the radio station today for a while, then I went to the movies with George, Giles, Ryan, and Avery. We went to Jay's after and we narrowly avoided the fuzz. By which I mean we saw somebody get pulled over in the parking lot.

Mark linked me to this guy's daily video journal. Some are funnier than others, but I liked this one: http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/05/050206.html

So I worked Giles' shoot, where we stripped Neal down to longjohns, sprayed him with PAM, covered him in industrial sand, then covered his hands, feet, and head in gauze. He couldn't here, see, or manipulate objects to well, so we put him in a tree and had him play with a bundle of sticks. Then Lenny shows up and pulls oone of those virgin mary cradeling the dead christ poses. Coupled with the carnival footage and the stuff with Ryan organizing bloody strawberries in the exposed plumbing of an abandoned house, this is going to be one strange film. 

Tiff has a birthday party this afternoon, and there's also a possibility of seeing MI3 with Sarah and Anthony. Possible cake party tonight as well.

Got a birthday card from my Uncle and family. Yay for unexpected holiday funding. 

Slither will be at the dollar theatre on Monday, and so will we. 

Watched Secrets & Lies, always meant to see that and I really loved it. Watched the first half of Elevator to the Gallows, which was great but the disk skipped so netflix will hopefully send another soon. 

Need to work on script for summer film. Got my official audit back in terms of graduating. After the fall I really have nothing left to take but my thesis. Hello wines of the World II and III. 

Yesterday I shot that lighting project I needed to. I was Ed Hopper in his self portrait, but I looked a little more Indiana Jones (probably the hat).

Went to McGregors and got a cheeseburger and a guiness. I love good barfood. 

Went to the carnival and shot some stuff with Giles. The SAU caught on fire after a propane tank went up, so I couldn't get to the radio station on Friday. 

Finished all the comics I bought and now want to read more (i like these mamoth b&w volumes). Got Boxoffice Poison since it cancelled out the shipping costs on those pots I had to buy since I destroyed some."

Proposing my thesis next week. Hope its painless, heard through the grapevine that the committee might be hard on me in order to scare everybody else. Don't know if there's any validity to it, but whatever. Foods of the world today was alright, German food. I'm not all that into sausage or liver cheese, or saurkraut, or potato salad, so that probably had something to do with it though. Shnitzle rocked though, as it often does. Some good german cake too. This old lady from Austria was the guest chef and she was hilarious. 70something, she recounted a great deal of her life's history through interlocking amusing anecdotes. 

Taping a friend of mine's band on Friday at the Bugjar. Shooting more training video stuff on Saturday morning. Shooting a great deal of my one quarter on Sunday. Lots of shooting. Matt dug what I sent him of the first act of the flick, so that's cool. I should send copies to other people involved. Give a holler. I know Alex is in, I forget who else I've chased after. Hopefully things will quiet down and I can finish writing the rest of it. I've secured a camera crane (a ghetto but effective jib really) for this summer. Its going to be a lot of fun. 

Need to make some progress on this Fulbright application. I think I've got a shot, which would be amazing. 

I've been making a lot of pizza. I like throwing the dough in the air and getting flour in my hair. Working on improving the sauce. Right now I'm leaning too much on the crushed red pepper to give it a kick. Maybe I'll try to make some pesto stuff. 

Saw Firewall at the dollar theatre with George and Giles tonight. It was so ridiculously stupid, but it had Harrison Ford. Hadn't realized how long it had been since I'd seen him in anything. Although eventually we just ended up making bad jokes ""Get off my ISP!"" Really bad jokes. 

When buying a couple of textbooks, I noticed that some class was reading Maus, so I picked up used copies of both volumes for cheap. This lead to me buying a couple comics I'd been meaning to on amazon. I got that one about the STD mutation thing called Black Hole, and an epic noir called Jinx by that Bendis guy. There was this one about British people I couldn't remember the title of and couldn't find but it looked kind of like the art from Blankets. Let me know if anybody knows what it's called."

"event","I just saw the first movie I ever felt like walking out of due to it being just plain ugly, gruesome, and made me feel like a bad person for baring witness to. It was The Hills Have Eyes. In a strage twisted way I sort of respect it since nothing's really created that gaping maw feeling in the chest in quite some time, but I don't know. Maybe it was the fact we sat two rows back, or maybe because I was tired or something, I don't know. Although a lot of people around us got up and left (twentysomethings too, no squeemish elderly), and Giles thought about it. It wasn't really scary, it was just brutal. I don't know."

One quarter film is starting to come together logistics wise. 

I've been told by a couple people that my two quarter is the best film they've ever seen at RIT. Wow. I felt it wasn't quite up to what I wanted it to be, but I guess that's healthy. Be kind of boring if it was like ""yep, that was brilliant, I'm going home to sleep with my wife."" I haven't seen Clue in forever. Should do that sometime. 

Couple of Netflix movies arrived today - Le Samourai and The Blue Angel. 

Been reading lots of A Lesson Is Learned But the Damage is Irreversable. I think its safe to say its my favorite webcomic ever (still very sucked into questionable content though). 

Screenplay this summer is coming along, and I might be able to borrow a crane for the shoots too which will add hella production value. I also have a lead on a production house selling some cheap tungsten lights that might turn out useful."

Birthday weekend was nice. Matt came up, we hung around at Brian's (watched some Bond, fixed up computers, went to a steakhouse with the fam, and skipped hand in hand through the park (by which I mean drove his sister to Oneonta). Tim ended up saving my computer after it had some issues. 

Watching netflix movies: Bubble, Sid and Nancy, All That Jazz, and my Dad got me all of that Battlestar Galactica show on DVD so I've been watching that.

My camera is shipping this week. Wee. So far the plot for the summer film is as follows (if this is going to work, we are going to shoot very fast, with lots of handheld and jumpcuts - it's going to very loose and very open to improv - I'm thinking 5 or 6 weekends total to shoot for):

Main character returns to his grandparents' home after running away from his current living arrangement upon discovering his girlfriend had an abortion behind his back. Finds his grandfather is missing and his grandmother isn't right in the head but becomes involved with a girl he runs into while looking for a lightbulb at 3AM - she's purchased all of them for installation art- (the grandmother hasn't been replacing bulbs). Said girl is currently on the outs with her ex, a local guy who got into the priesthood through the internet and does weddings regular priests won't touch (i.e. skydiving, scuba, punk, S&M). 

Main character discovers his grandfather had an agreement with an old army buddy that when they reached 75 they would dedicate the rest of their lives to trying to kill each other. At the same time, the priest gets in trouble when the bride is killed  during a pre-S&M wedding auto erotic session and the priest was a witness. He goes to his ex to hide, who is about to go on the road with the main character to stop the grandfather from killing anyone. Everyone ends up on the road with the S&M people chasing after them. 

Meanwhile, the grandfather discovers that his old army buddy is currently a vegetable and tries to rekindle an affair with the vacant man's wife. No one knows what happened to the army buddy, but the main characters' ex (the one who got the abortion) discovered the army buddy slumped over in his car when she ran out of gas (on the way home from the train station to try and catch the main character before he left). She drives the man's car back to the address listed on his driver's license. 

Could the army buddy just be faking to get an advantage? Will the S&M people catch up with everyone and will the old army buddies have to remember their training when they come under siege? Got me. I haven't written it yet. Should be fun though. It's going to be fast, ridiculous, and a breath of fresh air for me personally. 

Hmm, sister is yelling that project runway finale is airing. Hope Daniel wins. Yeah, you heard me you Chloe supporters."

"event","Winter's over, at least the academic winter, and I guess I'll throw my personal winter in there too. Double dose of Naomi and Johannes this quarter was less than stellar. Looking ahead though, skies seem to be clearing. I'm in with the best of the sophomore's, a couple junior's and a senior in Nancy's one quarter production class (you usually take it as a sophomore, I'm taking it again as an elective, and will do so again next year). Kilcher is in as DP with some amazing equipment (and my camera should ship next week as well with a couple of 4 gig P2 cards). I have a couple of other classes I'm looking forward to as well. 

My screening was Monday, went very well, although response in general was limited because everyone was exhausted from the some 200 short films that screened before it over three days - Anastasia and Kevin showed up especially for mine, and I think Goldberg did too. I know Drury was there because he talked about it later. Most of the best comments I got personally afterwards and throughout the day. I felt validated after Johannes' lukewarm response to what I had going, and his outright distaste for John's (which was met with the enthusiasm I thought it deserved). 

After the screenings on Tuesday, I presented the group project for film as literature which was a good time too. I liked that class, and that professor a lot. I'll read the textbook sometime over break because we really just skimmed it and it was really compelling. 

Almost went to MacGregor's after that but got a call from Amar about free pancakes from the radio station. So about 20 of us went to IHOP and it was very strange. The flamboyant engineering director got hard nipples from doing a syrup shot and I thought everyone was being racist repeatedly shouting ""Hey Paco!"" at our waitor. Turns out that was his name. Oops. Went back to the station for the Dating Game version of the Robbie Love show going on that night. Drew (this was also his going away party as he's graduating - we think) wrote the questions so it was a good time, although I think we were the only ones that enjoyed ""Where are all the good men dead, in the heart, or in the head?"" The skinhead ended up winning the girl, which I don't think pleased her any. Then everyone gave drew lots of presents, including a fake ass and a giant Gonzo. Michelle got upset on air after being gifted with a ringpop shaped like a penis. Theresa gave it to her for failing the whore test the week before and the  reaction didn't happen as planned. That was odd.

The next night we repeated the whole thing except this time it was Thai food. After that I went back to Amar's place and watched Kill Bill 2 with him and Jared. According to Jared's girlfriend (I should be able to remember her name by now but can't), the word ""cunt"" is making a big come back. I didn't know it had fallen by the vernacular wayside. It's like the president and the nuke button, you hope never to need it but it's nice that it's a button, and its...you know... all red and glowing. Or if you ever want to sound British. 

So today was spent catching up on lots of nothing. Renewed my driver's lisence and sorted out other online sort outable things. Watched some netflix movies - Constant Gardener and Eros, both cool (although what the hell happened to Antonioni - at least the buildings were cool in his short). Bubble hasn't shown up yet so I'm hoping I can get it tomorrow before I leave. George arrived midday to go pick up a medium format camera for the apartment (we still need to put that enlarger in the bathroom). The woman wasn't home so he just came back, sat down, and watched the movies with me. I felt like watching the Buffy musical, so I showed that to him too. He seemed to dig it. I'm tired, but I should pack. 

I'll probably just listen to more Benjamin Walker webcasts."

Yesterday morning we shot the film as lit movie (in one of the places I shot my production 1 so long ago), next to a horse farm under a busy bridge. We were using a real rifle, which was a little bit crazy considering Montana had to basically caress Chad's cheek with the barrel for 80% of the script. We were getting cold for the second scene under the bridge itself so I told John ""fuck it, break the line, we'll do 3 takes from all over the place, keep whip panning and zooming, we'll let Eric (the editor) sort it out). That's what we did, and I think it came out pretty good too. Amazing how often things start to come together once you stop caring about them."

Finally got Naomi happy with my script. It's dull as oat paste, but what can you do. Now I can forget that class ever happened and start writing something I'll actually make. Shame about that, because she does give 50% decent advice. It's just that the absolutely aggravating other 50% of antiquated sensibilities and just plain not getting things makes you never want to look at the script again. 

Long shoot last night, we were in this legal office shooting some more of Aaron's flick. I'm technically assistant director on that but since we didn't have a boom op I covered. I was really tired and my arms were definitely not up to that. In any case, it involved an afro sporting, 70's mustache wearing, leatherclad and flamboyantly gay mobster, so that was fun. His outfit alone made me want to shoot a 70's car chase. We walked outside at 2 in the morning, and somehow the weather had become gorgeous. It was like a cool summer afternoon with an ocean breeze. Maybe that's where Rochester has been hiding the good weather, at odd times we tend not to be out.

""So, when soldering cable, have your razor blade handy. We all had a ton of them back in the day. Hey, it was the 70's. Hmm, this one's dull and caked with something""

Umm. Should watch that doc Dark Days. Been sitting in its Netflix sleeve for a couple days. Think I get the second series of The Office today too. Finished all of the new Peckinpah collection except for Ballad of Cable Hogue. They were all decent, although I really liked Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. A western with James Coburn, Kris Krisstoferson, and Bob Dylan. 

Hey, how about how that new James Bond flick is getting cast? Layer Cake guy in the lead, The Dreamers girl as the femme fatale, Jeffrey Wright (detective friend from Broken Flowers, and a ton of other great character roles) as Felix. Just tell me Morcheeba is doing the song and the producers didn't fuck up the script again (I'm looking at you Cubbi Broccoli) and I'm there."

By WENN|Friday, February 03, 2006

HOLLYWOOD - German director Werner Herzog was shot by a crazed fan during a recent interview with the BBC.
The 63-year-old was chatting with movie journalist Mark Kermode about his documentary Grizzly Man, when a sniper opened fire with an air rifle.

Kermode explains, ""I thought a firecracker had gone off.

""Herzog, as if it was the most normal thing in the world, said, 'Oh, someone is shooting at us. We must go.'

""He had a bruise the size of a snooker ball, with a hole in. He just carried on with the interview while bleeding quietly in his boxer shorts.""

An unrepentant Herzog insisted, ""It was not a significant bullet. I am not afraid.""

""Oscar-nominee Joaquin Phoenix was rescued from his car wreck last week by German cult director Werner Herzog. The 31-year-old Walk The Line star overturned his car on a canyon road above Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood after his brakes failed and he collided with another vehicle. Phoenix was saved because he was wearing his seat-belt, but has revealed he was helped from the wreckage by the 63-year-old, who has a home nearby. The actor says, ""I remember this knocking on the passenger window. There was this German voice saying, 'Just relax.' There's the airbag, I can't see and I'm saying, 'I'm fine. I am relaxed. Finally, I rolled down the window and this head pops inside. And he said, 'No, you're not.' And suddenly I said to myself, 'That's Werner Herzog' There's something so calming and beautiful about Werner Herzog's voice. I felt completely fine and safe. I climbed out. I got out of the car and I said, 'Thank you,' and he was gone.""

I'm tired of the movie and none of my classes are all together interesting (although audio is fun and the film as lit class is good - they're just cancelled out by how boring two quarter and writing the short film are). 

After this quarter i have full control of my schedule again though so the rocking should return, and I can stick with professors I like/respect. 

I wonder if I should eat anything. 

Not really hungry. 

Nacho night the other night was great. A bunch of the radio people came over. We fried our own chips, made guacomole, cooked beans with habinero, made our own salsa, cooked up some meat,shredded a bunch of cheddar and monteray jack, and it all tasted so damn good. Then we watched Shaolin Soccer, which makes food taste better (its been proven). 

We've been coming up with zombie movies to make for next year. I'm going to love having a camera handy so damn much, I'm going to make it a hat.
Still percolating ideas for the movie this summmer. It's starting to resemble something, which is good, and its starting to resemble something I like, which is also good. 

We should make breakfast tacos tommorow. I think Mark bought a bag of potatoes for that very purpose. I wonder if his recipe is better than the Sin City ones (although its not exactly a dish with a huge amount of variation - minus the whole whatever you want in the egg part)."

I even thought the largely available light shooting looked better than November and the sex didn't get old like I thought it would. You could actually chart the narrative through it. 

Giles got F for Fake so we'll probably watch that. Burden of Dreams was really good (watched that at his place a couple of days ago).

My PC has been buggy lately so now I'm pretty much using the laptop exclusively until I reformat and clean out the tower (so much dust I'm surprised it hasn't caught fire. I haven't formatted the thing in two and a half years either). In any case, I switched the monitor over to the powerbook so now I have 2 screens.

Now all I need is some optical cable to connect the powerbook to my 5.1 speakers and I'll be in business. I should just mention I'm reformating to some computer friends and see if they get excited. I don't know if this is something I can get someone else to mess with for me or if its just boring for them. I need to get some blank DVDs first anyway to archive my music collection. That's the only thing on there I really still need that can't be reaquired. 

Production class tonight. Hope its over early so I can go do whatever.

Tommorow I'm going with Arnie and his production class to a telecine suite at Kodak and we're getting a hands on demo of how to telecine, color time, etc. <geek=""me""> Its going to be so rad </geek>

In high school there was a very specific moment I knew I pretty much had the place taken care of - when Dirubo said ""I can't read this, so I'm giving you an A."" I'm finding this camera deal and the sudden influx of other possible grants has pretty much solidified that with college. It feels nice."

"event","and I don't feel that sick. Which is good.

Cleaned my room today, also good. 

Classes start tommorow, that's alright I guess. Don't have a whole lot to do for the next seven weeks. I'll probably end up busy somehow though. 

Need to go the grocery store. I have little to eat except a chocolate santa, and he keeps silently judging me while I eat him. 

Over break found out I'm an outstanding undergraduate scholar. Don't think it comes with any money but means I'm higher that the top 1% of RIT and I get a free dinner. Amar and Heather got it too, plus a few animators. 

I'm still waiting for the purely speculative ""forgive all student loans"" award. It could happen."

"event","Really sick the latter end of this week. Poured some water through my nose and that sorted a lot out, as did medication. In any case, did the New Year's thing last night over at Kathleen's cousin's place with the standard crew + a toddler and a very focused DS player. 

Saw Dodgeball for the first time. To think Jack Nicholson almost switched careers with Rip Torn. 

Feeling better now. Watching a lot of Homicide. Eating some chicken pie. Things are good."

"event","I got bored today so I shaved (also my trimmer is dying). It feels weird. It would be cool if I liked the way I look shorn, because I enjoy the process of shaving. Hitting the razor on the edge of the sink, the noise of the water, playing around with foam, probability of spilling your own blood. 

Deposited my check and am faxing a preorder on the hvx. I figure if I get on the waiting list now, it'll result in maybe getting one from the third shipment so I won't have any of the first run issues. I also get the preorder price which is pretty sweet.

Got lots of Homicide in the mail. Looking forward to that. 

Sent Liz that copy of the Paris movie she has been asking about."

I feel tired. In any case, editing a lot tommorow. Want to get a lot done before the holidays make work seem far away.

Ran into Kathleen at value village. She seemed blurry. Probably because I didn't have glasses. 

Reading Dave Eggers ""How Are We Hungry"" and liking it a lot. Also bought Alex Garland's latest. 

I made a really good sandwich too."

"event","Last day in Rochesterland. I got some footage captured, gave it to my editor, and sealed up a few loose ends. Lots of snow to walk through and the pod's shuffle was favoring simon/garfunkle.

I came home and fell asleep for an indeterminate period of time and now Mark and I are greeting the break by watching lots and lots of Homicide. (5 episodes so far, think we have 3 more left before the netflix batch runs out). 

The fact that I can make a movie this summer (what with the sweet sweet camera) is quickly dawning on me. I'm thinking this'll be a rejuvinative experience a la Chung King Express in the middle of Wong Kar Wai's Ashes of Time debacle. Give a shout out if you're interested in helping out at any stage of the game (writing/acting/crewing/music - whatever, this is going to be a really off the cuff king of thing)."

"event","today, shot a lot of movie (looked very good) played with dry ice and made a mess (looked very good). Finished in time for whole crew to go to Dryden and watch The Empire Strikes Back (very nice print). Ate a cranberry sauce turkey and brea sandwich on a baguette at their cafe that was very good.

Tommorow, shoot a lot (play with fireworks) and try to get done in time for whole crew to see The Sacrifice at the Dryden.

Monday - Get Brinks proposal in and resubmit some info for funding before class - then go see A History of Violence at the Dollar Theatre.

Tuesday - Sleep a lot/write/ take a test

Wednesday - Shoot a lot for Aaron, Monster Foley Session, Midnight King Kong Screening

Thursday - Loose ends (Serenity at the dollar theatre?)

Friday -Radio show/get out of Dodge"

In any case, not a whole lot new. Classes are decent. We're redoing all the sound for the King Kong trailer in the advanced sound class. That is going to be insane.

I started editing my film, doesn't look like a disaster so far. That's always nice. 

Went to see Capote with Sarah, Anthony, and Brian yesterday. We ate out and went to a record store I hadn't been to before. Decent place, strange smell. 

I just made a sandwich out of a baked chicken I bought yesterday. Threw in some rye, arugala, and bleu cheese dressing and we were in business. 

I'll probably watch some netflix movies today. Got a shoot for Aaron tommorow. I shoot again next weekend and hopefully will finish up most everything."

Watched Adapatation in Film as Lit. We're watching Clockwork Orange at some point too. He hasn't given us the full play list yet.

Tommorow is advanced sound and then I have nothing to do for four days. Netflix movies should be here tommorow."

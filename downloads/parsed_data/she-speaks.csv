My show for this semester is: Wednesdays from 12-noon to 1pm on CKDJ 107.9 or www.ckdj.net

My newscast is on Mondays at 10am

My parents have lent me their car. Probably for the whole semester.

Apparently the Team 1200 wont have any more work for me until .... summer? Easter? 

I desperately need something exciting and unschool/radio related to keep me going for the next few months. I need some sort of distraction.

I got my grades back a little while ago. 3.82 GPA.

I've felt restless lately."

"event",""" Am I awake?

What time is it?

When I get through this day 
Can someone tell me how 
And how much longer now
Am I awake?

The coffee's cold, did I forget to drink it yet
Did I forget?
My clothes are wet I don't remember drinking it

When I get through this part
Will the next one be the same 
Will I be wondering
If I'm awake?

These are not the clothes I had on when I went to bed
And something else besides my hair is growing from my head
And when I close my eyes it looks the same as when I open them again

Am I awake?

What time is it?

Is it that time again?
Wasn't it already then?
So does it have to be
The time it was again

When I get through this day
Can't someone tell me how
And how much longer now
Am I awake?

I think they say it's 8... maybe 8 days until it becomes a habit not to care again.... ~ try not to try, try not to care, it's really easy once you learn that no one is listening ~

it would be easier i think if i wasn't so bored.. but i don't have anything to do.. home sick with mono which is getting worse and worse..."

"event","There's this one Face to Face album that I always like to belt out when I'm feeling this way.... it's the Big Choice album... it's funny because the first time I went through the lyrics I thought they were done so poorly... I remember thinking about how horrible they were...

""you think that i'm invincible
it's going to pull me down
you think that i'm invisible 
it's going to pull me down
to somwhere i don't want to go
it's okay

you think i'm indestructible
it's going to pull me down
you think that i'm a miracle
it's going to pull me down
to somwhere i don't want to go
it's okay

i don't know what you want  from me
but it's probably already gone
i don't care what you think of me
your opinion means nothing at all

don't say i'm okay
don't say i'm okay
don't say i'm okay
i'm not okay""

""Big lies
Surprise
you've thought of everything
it builds your character you know
no way
okay
so what's the price you pay?
too late to realize you're broke...

But this was all your choice
do you think it makes a difference now?
This was all your choice
It's good to see it hasn't changed you

You've tried 
Denied
Can't win at everything
It's building Character you know
Don't wait
Too late""

And last night he was kind of like...

""You think you're all over with it
Don't want to talk about it
I'll tell you something
you don't want to know

So what's the problem with my life?
Don't overcomplicate it
Let's stop with all this wasting time
I feel you all around
There's nothing else that I can see
Anything is better than nothing

I'll try and try
I wont be denied
I want my chance
I want what's mine""

But i was like
""tell me something 
that i don't already know
tell me how you plan to save the world...

I know that you might never understand
the way i feel
I made a promise to myself
that I would never let it show

Never look down
Never look down
Just keep my focus straight ahead
And try to walk this line...""

and then trying to keep myself mad...

""it's all the same inside our minds
everything is justified
what is wrong and what is right
everything is justified""

That was probably the worst part... Just the humiliation and stupidity of it all you know... I wanted to get so mad... I wanted to yell and scream and swear but I found that I just couldn't.... I cared too much to be mad.. if that makes sense.. normally me being mad is just to cover up my hurt anyway... Still feels like everything that has happened in the last three months was a lie."

""Come Out Fighting""

Originally recorded by Pennywise,
dedicated to the memory of JasonMatthew Thirsk

Voices! You're letting voices tell you what to do
when you yourself don't know.
Voices! You got one too, so let it out
and let us know when you're feeling all alone.

Well I know,
There are times when- you're feeling close to the ground
And there's times when- you may feel there's no place to call home
And there's times when- your best friend just seems so far away
And there's times when- the only end in sight is the end

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!
Don't let it get you down.

Problems! I've got em too but keeping them inside is not the thing to do.
Problems! You've got to face hang-ups head-on, before you know they're hangin' you.

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!

All alone yes all alone. Loneliness, it is something we all know.
Woooh all alone, yes all alone. Been there before so please believe me
'cause I know.

You've got to come out fighting! Come out fighting! Come out fighting!
Come out fighting!"

DJEMBE

Dancing to the sound of a beating drum
My eyes closed; blind to all but the sound
Limbs fill with rhythm; my mind going numb
My heart keeping time with the soothing pound
Like medicine, the drum eases my pain
Massages my muscles; my great masseur 
Breath; directing oxygen to my brain
Bass be my therapy, drum be my cure
Drum take me high; away to my safe place
Drum take me home; I long for your embrace"

"" I hope you never lose your sense of wonder, 
You get your fill to eat 
But always keep that hunger, 
May you never take a single breath for granted, 
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed, 
I hope you still feel small 
When you stand beside the ocean, 
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens, 
Promise me, that you'll give faith a fighting chance 
 And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance . I hope you dance 

I hope you never fear those mountains 
in the distance, 
Never settle for the path of least resistance, 
Living might mean taking chances 
But they are worth taking, 
Loving might be a mistake 
But it's worth making, 
Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter 
When you come close to selling out 
Reconsider, 
Give the heavens above more 
Than just a passing glance, 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance . I hope you dance 

I hope you still feel small 
When you stand beside the ocean, 
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens, 
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance, 
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance 

I hope you dance . I hope you dance "" L.W."

first -- it does not make sense to vandalize a daycare playground. it's worse than stealing candy from a baby. it's senseless and mean and it's really hard to explain to children why some strangers came and spilled over their garden and broke the branches off their trees. 

second -- i can fully appreciate contructive criticism but don't tell me how to do my job just for the sake of telling me how to do my job and then go and ask me to do yours. it doesn't make sense and i don't like it.

Kick It 
by the Vandals

I don't need much attention anymore
Sometimes I cringe at the thought of the things that I did before
And I don't wanna take up all your time
Sometimes I cringe at the thought of being left behind
She said ""You're not the boss of me""
And I don't wanna be
Just some guy trying to be something that I'm not

CHORUS
Do you wanna kick it, wit me?
I wanna kick it with you
Do you wanna kick it, wit me?
I wanna kick it with you

Everyone has something for you now
And I know, well I hope that I one be one of the crowd
If you feel that I am out of line
Well I hope that you don't, but I won't wait in line
I have learned not to offer much advice
Who am I? Just a guy, like I know how to run your life
Well I guess I'll tell you who I am
I'm a man with a plan make you say goddamn
She said ""You're not the boss of me""
And I don't wanna be
Just some guy trying to be something that I'm not

CHORUS (2x)
And everybody's got something new to offer you
And all the wonderful things that they can do
I keep it simple- I just wanna kick it wit you"

Sound system gonna bring me back up
One thing that I can depend on
Try to describe to the limit of my ability:
Its there for a second
Then it's given up what it used to be
Contained in my music somehow more than just sound
This inspiration coming and twisting things around
Because you always know that its gonna have to go
You always know that you'll be back in the cold.
Point of departure sublimated in a song
Its always coming to give me that hope for just a second
Then its gone but!
Static pulse inside of music bringing us escape
Its always temporary changing nothing in its wake
Just a second where were leaving all this shit behind
Just a second but its leaving just this much in mind:
To resist despair that second makes you see
To resist despair because you cant change everything
To resist despair in this world is what it is to be free
Wake up turn my box on
Bust the shade let the sun in
times getting tougher bout time to start runnin
Box in my hand music by my side
Skanking to the rhythm of the music by my side"

You're the Only One - MTX

You're the only one for me I tell you three or four times a day. When you're with me I'm happy. I'm lost and lonely when you're away. Every night I have to spend without you my suffering grows ever more and more. I wouldn't suffer like this for just anyone-- you're the only one I want to suffer for. You're the only one. Now we've established something precious, but chances are it could go awry when we find how weak the flesh is, shattered, scattered, hung out to dry. It'll all come out when it's dicovered, clearer than the teardrop in my eye, but I don't want to get screwed over by just anyone-- you're the only one I want to get screwed over by. You're the only one. My heart is a mess yes it's true. I've tried to fix it up just for you. It's not done yet but it will have to do. Oo woo oo oo. I know there are so many others out there who might like a chance to get a crack at it too, but if my heart's gonna get broken anyway I'd rather have it get broken by you. You're the only one..."

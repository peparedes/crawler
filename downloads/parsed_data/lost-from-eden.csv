My darkness would have consumed her before too long; it is better she begin again with another more worthy man than continue down this lone road of despair with me. Do not think however that I'm not heartbroken, that the grip of lonielness does not crush my heart. But pain is bearable, at best that final reminder that we are alive and that life is not over. We must solidier on, no? In any case, now that I am truly back in the states, I'll be around a bit more frequently. Till I hear from you all again. Adieu..<br /><br /><br />The lost one</font>"

"event","<strong><em><font color=""#800000"">An excerpt from a story I'm writing...I'm open to any commentary on it. It's a Vampire novel, to make it a little clearer for you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny how these human beings arrayed themselves in such gaudy, tasteless colors, Derek mused, moving amongst the crowds outside the concert hall, his every cell pulsing with the throb of bass and bloodlust. How plain he must look in comparison, despite the natural paleness of his skin, the oily darkness of his hair, the unobtrusive combination of leather motorcycle jacket and ripped jeans. No painted faces, no macabre costumes, no faux paux wounds or blood for this one. He wove a silent path through the crush of the masses, holding in check his usual strength, his lithe frame finding little resistance and quite a few appreciative glances. He ignored these as he ignored everything else around him, his focus intense and singular. Her scent had led him here; somewhere among these great pretenders was the real thing. The whore, the one who'd stolen his heart along with his humanity, was not some masquerading killer. She claimed to be nothing more than she was, a cruel and destructive Harpy feeding on the lifeblood of those who took her fickle fancy. He'd come initially to rip out her black heart with his bare hands, to perish with her in a great conflagration, the only death he saw as fitting for one as sick and demented as Lilliana. Yet he could not deny a certain lust for her in his heart...tugging at him and slowly eating away at what little will he was capable of gathering for this task. His eyes, normally a ocean blue, shifted to a pure silver as he neared her, her very proximity making his body positively hum with anticipation. Several of her lesser ""children"" surrounded her, a vagabond gang of runaways and the unwanted. Derek snarled inwardly in a pitch no human ear could possibly detect. There was murder plain and simple in this sound and the young ones gazed around nervously, unable to gauge exactly who'd made the threatening invocation. Lilliana herself cast a cool, unaffected glance in Derek's general direction, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. If it was a bloodbath he wanted, she'd be more than happy to oblige....<br /><br /><br />I'll give you guys a bit more when next I post.<br /><br /><br />The Rest is Silence...Fear the Resonance....<br /><br />Adieu<br /><br />The Lost One</font></em></strong>"

"event","<p><em><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""1"">I'll be the first to admit that I'm having major trouble getting into the Chrsitmas spirit..that could be because I'm far from home and have no way of getting there. I've been stationed in Cherry Point, N.C. and regretably, I am unable to take leave until the first of the New Year. I have therefore elected to withdraw, to beat a hasty and much needed retreat back to my own little dark corner of the universe and bid farewell to all things pertaining to Chris Kringle. No tree, no carols, no presents, no television Christmas specials... just me, a warm bed, and a good book. Besides, this holiday has become of a commercial machine than a religious symbol anyway. I'm just not in the mood to buy in this year. I'm glad that there's no one here trying to change my mind. I can sit in peace....without the tiresome annoyance of someone saying to come to some lame-ass party or some such drivel...in any case, to those of you who are going all out, kudos and Merry Christmas to you....for me, it's just another day in the life.<br /><br /><br />The Rest is Silence...the Resonance kills...<br /><br />Adieu<br /><br />The Lost One</font></em></p>"

"event","<em><font color=""#800000"">How nice indeed to be back in my secluded, dark axel of the universe, watching this little dustball of a world spin ever onward towards oblivion. Pessimistic view, no? But a true one, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I've no idea when exactly I became so faithless. I've been gone these past couple months, becoming embroiled in a war I do not believe in, doing things I never thought I am capable of. Perhaps I've become the monster my enemies always knew that I would. Or worse. Who's really to know? *shrugs* In any case, I cannot help being what the world has helped mold me into...a minister of death, a blade in the grasp of the supposedly holy U.S. government to be used to cut and hack its way towards its own convuluted objectives...and yet, I asked for this. The humanistic part of me, the part I've always sought to supress by turning my mind to the pursuit of cold, rigid knowledge, is still there, questing as all humans do towards the base things. Death, carnage, the inner need to conquer and control...we deny this truth to ourselves, even when confronted with evidence of it at every turn. Flip on your television to CNN and it's there glaring at you from within the screen.<br /><br />So I've made a silent vow with myself. A vow not to deny what I am. A destroyer, a great consuming carnivore, ever hungry, ever thristing for the next item of prey to bring into my killing maw.<br /><br /><br />Fear not the silence....It is the resonance that kills.<br /><br />Adieu<br /><br />The Lost One</font></em>"

"event","<strong><em><font color=""#800000"" size=""1"">I had the oddest experince the other day. And I'm not sure how to take it.<br /><br />A very good friend of mine is an amateur filmaker. (Check out BadGoneGood on myspace.com to see some of his work. He's quite talented.) He threw a party for the casts of his past few features and as one of his many creative consultants, he invited me to it. So there I was, sipping a glass of water and engaging a few of the actors in conversation when I hear a laugh. Soft and beautiful, eerie almost in its familiarity. It was the laugh of one of the first women I'd ever loved, one of those things you never forget. I nearly spilled my drink. And then she walked in, her hair the same fiery red I remembered, her face a little more careworn from the years but no less alluring than it had been all that time ago when she'd been mine. ""Nora?"" I said, a little afraid, wondering if this was all a figment of my imagination. She didn't recognize me until I stood up and she looked just as shocked and pleased to see me. We talked almost the entire party, reminiscing over our time together, me silently wishing things could have been different between us. We exchanged phone numbers, the kisses on the cheek friends sometimes do at goodbyes. And now I have reached a quandry. I want her....perhaps more than I ever realized. You see, we parted only because we both moved and could not hope to hold on to each other. Could this be a sign of some sort? I just get the feeling that this is something I should pursue. Maybe I'm wrong. But I'll not know until I try..<br /><br /><br />The Rest is Silence...Fear not the Resonance...<br /><br />The Lost One</font></em></strong>"

<P><EM><FONT color=#660000>I suppose things are as good as could be hoped for. School's going alright, my band's doing well (playing on St. Valentine's Day, actually) and I'm healthy physically, if not entirely mentally. I guess there is no REAL reason for the melancholy I feel, save that fact that plagues all true lonely souls: I am alone. No warmth of eyes, nor touch of a woman's lips adorns me. This is, friends, not for lack of searching. I know as well as any that Cupid's arrows can strike anyone with open eyes, but they seem to have all missed me. Perhaps, I've no right to complain, but it rankles that so many other less-deserving people seem to have this one thing, so small and yet so damned significant that I can not hope to grasp for myself. Why must I wander this dull earth in solitude while others know such a union of souls? Is there, God forbid, something wrong with me?</FONT></EM></P>

"event","<P><EM><FONT color=#990000>Thursday. Morning. Cold is a silent sentinel outside, ice and snow littering the here and there. The sun cast what little pallid light it can muster over a dead world. Striking it is in its beauty, its clean, sterile emptiness...fits my mood most exquistely. Mood...(a sad smile crosses the lips) I've been told it is a thing reserved for cattle and lovemaking, but I feel that perhaps given my current circumstances, one should make allowances for the wrathful as well.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#990000>Time drifts by uncertainly, as if it seeks to avoid the anger I struggle to hold in check. It is not my friend and never has been. And even now, it works against me. I used to believe that I was free...but now I find in an old woman's ignorance the truth: We are not free. Every day we add another line, another layer to this sad grid we require to perceive the universe. We classify and label everything and that which doesn't or cannot be classified, labeled, studied...we instead fear. These filters or the lens of perception seems more and more like it is built of prejudices in today's people than at any other time. What are we now, with all this technology and supposed knowledge, that we fail to percieve another deeper world all around us? I feel as one buried still alive, clawing my way through the earth above toward some great truth just out of reach.&nbsp;We seek to understand a world, an existence, even our own lives in stages, dimensions, and phases. But this is in&nbsp;a way foolish. To gain understanding of a process, one must study it while it is in progress. I have studied the world in motion...and now it seems a myriad of conclusions fall before me, challenging me to choose one. </FONT></EM></P>

<P><EM><FONT color=#660000 size=1>Or so I've heard. I think that finally the truth of that statement is turning 'round to proverbally bite me in the 'arse. I'm searching for a place that myself and two best friends can slip into without bankrupting ourselves in the process, juggling classes at school(tons of fun...*insert sarcastic eyeroll here*), and trying to sort out feelings I should be denying anyway. I need a drink...something hard that will help burn the memory away.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#660000 size=1>I went to see my friend of the 23rd for her 21st birthday and had a blast. Almost went and killed a guy...with a borrowed blade, no less. *shrugs* I can think of worse ways to spend a Thursday night. In any case, the night was made awkward by the fact that her fiance', my best friend, was there. They both know I have major feelings for the birthday girl, but that I'm not a homewrecker, so I'll keep what I feel under wraps. Still, it's really not easy...your best friend and the girl of your dreams. It's like a badly scripted episode of Dawson's Creek. So much drama....and still I stay around, cuz' I don't wanna be a bad friend or seem like a jealous bastard.(Which I just might be...not really sure how to feel.) In any case, that's my issue...for this week. I guess that I either should deal or blow the whole fuckin' scene.</FONT></EM></P>

are the lyrics to the first song on our demo, the only one I wrote
entirely on my own. I think it's the least strongest of our songs but
it means a lot to me. There is some debate about whether to cut it or
not, so I'm hoping for some feedback.)<br>
<br>
dedicated with undying love to the memory of my dear Teresa<br>
<br>
My reflection is a stranger<br>
My flesh a dull reminder<br>
A prison I surrender <br>
If only for moments to have her<br>
<br>
Oppression, regression<br>
She makes me the monster<br>
her darkest obsession<br>
she's taking me under<br>
<br>
(chorus)<br>
living no meaning <br>
no longer discerning <br>
the voice in my head<br>
it feels like she's burning<br>
her name in my eyes<br>
And I am not seeing<br>
the ghost I sleep with <br>
is gone from being...<br>
<br>
<br>
Beneath it all, I do enjoy<br>
her blackouts and white noise<br>
What methods doth she employ<br>
to render me another broken toy<br>
<br>
Submission, constriction<br>
taking away the better part of me<br>
addiction, affliction<br>
blind my eyes for I don't wish to see<br>
<br>
(chorus)<br>
<br>
(bridge)<br>
Grant me a kinder fate than this<br>
slow death with her name on my lips<br>
Take this crown of tears from my head<br>
No longer will I sleep with the dead.<br>
Begone...Begone...Begone...<br>

<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#c0c0c0>As most of you are aware, I'm a Wiccan, something of an Earth worshiper. Thus, my most prized possession, beside my Livejournal and Dahlia( my guitar), is my Book of Shadows, a book that holds all of my spells and rituals, the very center of my practice. It has mysteriously dissappeared from its place, at the foot of my altar. The very act of moving it throws into chaos all the energies I've gathered for the act of spell-casting. And it holds far more than that...everything I've managed to gain in knowledge of the Black Arts (which I do not practice, mind you) was contained with. Curses, death charms...the potential damage is nearly limitless. I know such things should not perhaps be written, but it is a part of my duty to safeguard such knowledge as a Rune Scribe within my circle. Maybe I sound a little crazy...but if you've seen what I've seen, you know all of this works, that Magick is definitely a real force. </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#c0c0c0>I suspect that Michelle took it....and her vengeful nature makes her quite a danger with such knowledge. She was once a part of our Circle and she betrayed our oath to never tap into the Black Arts before, seeking to curse a girl who'd threatened her. We bound her from doing harm and declared her exiled from the Circle, though we've struggled to maintain a friendship with her. To what purpose though could she have stolen my Book? She cannot cast anymore unless one of us removes the binding. To show to someone? My Book is not only locked with a physical lock but written in my own Runes. No one but her and someone else in my Circle would draw any meaning from what they see. In any case, I plan on getting it back. It's far too great of a danger in her hands. Still, I wonder why...why take an object of such obvious power from one who sought to keep you as a friend? This betrayal will not,by any means, go unpunished. The Circle isn't known for being forgiving of acts such as this, though I will plead for leniency. </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

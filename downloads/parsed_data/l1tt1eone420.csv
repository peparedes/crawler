"event","Well I just got back from going to Canada to visit my good friend Noah for New Years.  I had an excellent time and excellent bonding was accomplished.  We went to a bar and had a drink or two and some chicken wings, then up to Toronto and went to 5ives and then to the Comfort Zone at 3.  I stayed there until 11 in the morning and then had to skidaddle outta that place.  It was a fun, interesting, and unique night.  Later that day, at about 3/4 when we got back to his house and literally stayed in bed ALL day and night.  It was also fun.... not that kind of fun though, innocent fun!
All in all I had a superb weekend and was sorry to see it end.
Happy New Years everyone who reads this.... which is probably maybe one person if im lucky :("

Like a shining star, you have no trouble being the center of attention
In fact, you often feel a bit hurt when all eyes aren't on you
You need to be number one in everything, no matter how trivial
And it's this ego that both hurts your confidence and helps you acheive

You're dramatic and a powerhouse of pure energy
You posess a divine quality or uniqueness that's hard to define
A natural performer, it's likely you'll become famous in some circles.
Just learn not to take everyone's reaction to you so personally!

"event","I watched a movie last night and it was really......... indescrribable.  It was really what I needed.  It reminded me I need to open my eyes to whats going on around me....... also that we could all be dreaming..... but we wouldn't really all be dreaming.  Only one of us.  The rest of us would be part of the dream.  I could not really exist right now.  I could just be someone elses dream.  They talked about how you sometimes think dreams are real and then you ""wake up"" and everything turned out to be a dream even though you didnt think it was...... its really rather spooky.  The move was called Waking Life and if anyone has a chance- watch it. Watch it stoned prefferably- I know its a cliche, so shoot me, it really helps.
I would like to remind everyone who reads this to notice how great every moment is.  You could not be here the next.  Enjoy every part of life, theres so much beauty and awesomeness in it, even if its hiding from you.  Make the most out of everything you doing, from doing the laundry to writing poetry- its all great."

"event","Well, Im feeling a lot better now.  I got ripped and went to my friend Brents house.  I felt much better after he had done reiki on me.  I had a lot of bad energy i needed a hand with (No pun intended for those who know about reiki :) ).
I'm eating green olives and their salty.
Have u ever seen someone u used to ""see"" and remembered how much u had actually liked them?
Im done with the olives- their too salty.
Im tired..... but i want to read some of my book Anna Karinina that I havent really started yet.
I finished ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" a few days ago, i thouroughly reccomend it- VERY GOOD BOOK.  Im glad my best asian freind in the world lent it to me cuz she's neet.
I need to take my contacts out but im too lazy...... i wonder if i should just sleep in them..... but i hate the way they feel in the morning.

"event","Now I know why people hate the holidays.  Why do I hate it?  For a couple reasons-
1.  Its my first thanksgiving without my boyfriend of three years(who didn't even call to say happy thanksgiving... not that I would expect some1 who wasn't considerate to me in the first place to start when were just friends)
2.  I'm always the one to call and wish a happy thanksgiving and never the one to be called (except for one person).
3.  I have no one to care enough to call me.... or be with me on thanksgiving.
4.  I know I dont have it that bad so I can't even give myself some self pity.
5.  ...... I'm just lonely
6.  I don't know but I'm sure Im missing something"

"event","Well, it's been another day where I've woken up in Orchard Park around 4 in the afternoon.  I can't seem to wake up any time before 3..... But I stay up all night reading a book my friend Karen (the craziest asian alive) gave me.  It's called Memories of a Geisha and it's one of the best books I've ever read.
Unrelated though, I havent been going out and getting hammered like I always do here.... except for Friday night, but that doesnt count.  It's actually pretty nice and I make an ass out of myself a lot less.
Also, my phone cant recieve Instant Messsages or Text Messages anymore.  I don't know why, but I'm very upset about it.
I can't wait to eat yummy food on Thanksgiving."

I finally convinced my roomate to take gravities with me!!! WOoooooOoooOoo.  Its actually a lot of fun, and I laughed a lot.  My friend Josh made staying up all night sound kinda fun today when we were sitting at the Williams Center so i figured I'd try it.  Thats y I am leaving so many .........stupid ......journals?
The fact of the matter is that I don't know how to work this ""livejournal"".  Also, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing on here.   I'm really just dicking around and getting confused...... Therefore............. This wont be the last time you'll be hearing from me.
Over and Out

Wait...... I am kinda tired now..... maybe ill try goind to bed.......

wait....... i dont know if i want to ..... i want to get up at 9:30 and ill be tired....er...?

I should go to bed or just go read ""Angels and Demons"" by Dan Brpwn, because I want to have Erie breakfast with my friend Sean tomarrow at 10am.  Then I have to study for a philosophy test about materialism and dualism later on.  I'm glad I decided to stop going to my Masterpieces from 1400-present class (which would be at 11). Otherwise I would hang a humongus paper to hand in..... and don't say I'm a quiter, I just decided to give up."

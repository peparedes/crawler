i'm not sure if that makes me human, inhuman, indifferent. but i barely know how to grieve and i've been doing it for days now."

Advantages: 
~watch this program to advance
~be more comfortable with this town and with the people in it
~i really like my little attic apt
~i usually like my location the second year (second year of college, second year of grad school)
~it would be an extension of experiences i need, including more grantwriting! which would get me hired in the non-profit sector.
~Spearfish has taught me to simplify my life 
~i wouldn't be paying moving costs
~it has taught me to be very independent and self sufficient
~i'm more likely to stay single.


Disadvantages
~its far away from EVERYBODY i know. 
~the job isn't perfectly in my field (i'm more into international issues, its a very homogenous town - its also higher ed focused and i'm not) 
~there is no long term prospects and i'm only procrastinating
~it has made me more of a loner

"event","call me crazy.<br>
<br>
so those who know me, know i'm in a geographic debate... where do i go
to find my next AmeriCorps position/non-profit job. (i'm not limited to
AmeriCorps positions, but there would be advantages...) but in the
midst of a geographic dillema. and today, the weirdest thing happened.
i heard a city's name. and the thing is, it has sounded more perfect
(at least for now) than any other city i could possibly think of.
REALLY weird. everywhere i have thought of has drawbacks. so there
seems to be a list of 3 unlikely cities that i'm seriously considering.
(that i have no job prospects for, mind you all! before any excitement
comes) what's even weirder, is each one of them has a weird family
quest association to them. so that just makes me wonder... <br>
<br>
anyways, the city that had the really freakish/nonlogical/heart
lead/god lead (whatever you want to call it) was: baltimore, md and yes <lj user=""illdrawnbalcony"" />,
oddly enough when you mentioned it, the epiphany was the most peaceful
one i've had about ANY city that anyone mentioned. and i have NO clue
why. so, i'm gonna be looking into it. i'm not sure about permanency or
anything. but something still makes baltimore sound/feel more right
than any other city.<br>
<br>
other two cities: phoenix, AZ and charleston, SC (or columbia, SC - meh close enough) <br>
<br>
granted, my most logical searches are: seattle, wash DC, boston, nyc
(so i know the difference and won't dismiss them, but may spend a
little time researching these options most. - and most heavily. (for
now.) <br>
<br>
just weird, thought i'd share. i still have a furrowed brow... its been
a bit since the conversation and yeah, i'm still thrown off.<br>

"event","these lyrics describe my mood well..

i omitted the first verse... wasn't as applicable, if you want to see it i posted it on myspace.

....
This scar is a fleck on my porcelain skin
Tried to reach deep but you couldn't get in
Now you're outside me
You see all the beauty
Repent all your sin

It's nothing but time and a face that you lose
I chose to feel it and you couldn't chose
I'll write you a postcard
I'll send you the news
From a house down the road from real love...

Live through this, and you won't look back...
Live through this, and you won't look back...
Live through this, and you won't look back...

There's one thing I want to say, so I'll be brave
You were what I wanted
I gave what I gave
I'm not sorry I met you
I'm not sorry it's over
I'm not sorry there's nothing to say

I'm not sorry there's nothing to say...

i just ran across my second topical reference to that silly town/television show - that is based 10 miles from me. i giggle everytime i go to deadwood. its so bizarre and intriguing in the same breath. 

1. 5th season of gilmore girls. ""if paris is happy, everybody is happy. if paris is angry, its deadwood"" 

2. a scrubs reference last night... when j.d. is playing off the word dead. and then goes into a tangent about cowboys and shooting... etc.

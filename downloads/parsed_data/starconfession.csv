I'm tired and i don't feel like going to the fricken mall for our field trip of secret shoppers. And i really don't feel like going shopping afterwords. Grammy's here.

I had a lot of fun last night though. We all went to Lincohn to roller blade and play on the playground. It's fun to do things like that. To be a kid again. And i liked how no one said it's nice to act like a kid again cause i didn't want to remember that i wasn't one for an hour or so. 

I'm going to Disneyland on the 21's and coming back on the 26th. Monica's family is taking me. Ohhhh boy. Everyone is leaving for Colton's b-day.

There's two things i want to do but i know i wont. Okay, maybe even three. Minus Vince is playing at The Edge on the eleventh. Brian is playing in Niles this Saturday. And Brian, Brett, Anthony, and David are having a Grad bash and i got two invites one from brian, and one from anthony. I want to go. But i really can't. I miss out on a lot. Kinda too much. 

I can't sit in gov. for nearly two hours. I want some bread. I want my final to be done. I need motivation pills more than anything. 

I'm nervous about my research paper. I mean, if she'll accept it and all. It's in the next batch to grade. She's hecka slow. Always. 

When is this day going to be over already? When will today be over all ready? When will high school?! When will my life be over already?

I want me a nice digital camera. I should have boughten one that saturday. I sure as hell should have. I want to take pictures of becca and people. 

Man do i suck!

Last night Grandma brought two albums that had my dad's pictures when he was a little kid. I wanted to scan some. I hope she doesn't say anything about them because he'll get really mad."

Right now I'm fully enjoying my Co&Ca cd. Full potential. I would have really liked to see them play with The Used. Damnit. 

I feel like put this cd in the car and driving to San Fransico to see some band. Heh, at this point any non really famous band. I just feel like being alone and driving away from things. That's all."

I think i'm missing the big picture to this whole research paper. From what I hear most people are a little lost but then i expected them to be or to at lest say it. Last year i kept arguing with the teacher about the whole system. 

I feel like playing on melo. 

I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. Nor the day after. 

Today was/is my dad's birthday. I took him out to dinner. This was exciting because i'm getting to use my ATM card and learn how this whole money world some what works. I feel kinda growing up. Diner was okay. It's nice to know it's not totally brain racking to talk to him. 

But in the big news. Monica's b-day is coming and to be honest. I'm scared. I have idea's but don't think they are anything big that she'll like. Getting it done and bought is the big thing. This always happens. I'm one of thoes people who give really crappy non personal gifts and i hate it. 

I have the whole night and i always end up getting to stressed to actually work on anything."

"event","Yo. I really needed to say that I was reading my shameful diary and saw that I said ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" wasn't as good as ""Catcher in the Rye"" but what was i thinking?! It's way better. It's at LEST twice as better if not more. I think I would believe it to be 500 times better if my english teacher read it and brought all those symbolistic stuff to my attention. I wouldn't want the whole class reading it cause ya know. I get greedy and like to keep things important to myself. Cause I'm a bitch. 

Have you seen Sum 41's ""Hell Song"" video? It's pretty dope. Ya know, if there's anyone in the world who is reading this and likes that kinda stuff check it out. The whole video is done with action figures and toys and ""guest star action figures"" like Ludacris, The Spice Girls, KoRn members. Yeah. I know what you're thinking.

Wow how sweet is this. Someone brings in doughnuts and it was down to a maple one an a chocolate one with powder on it and there was someone before me. But he lets me go first. He always does cause i'm a ""lady"". Most of the time i just feel stupid but this time I was just happy to get me a maple doughnut. But that's not all! After this class I'm getting a Supreme Croissant from Jack In the Crack which I've had my eye on for years. Sometimes getting up early is worth it. 

My mom talks a lot. I mean, at lest in the car to and from schools. 

Yesterday I've noticed that I've been happy for a while now. Well when I mean happy I mean not being etreemly mad and like ""ahhhh"" ::raises arms:: and it's kinda odd. I'm thinking maybe that it due to the fact that Monica hasn't been on Aim to much and uh something like that? I could be wrong of course. And then I was looking at the calender and I was thinking ""i only have a week left?"" and it made me kinda sad. But no no. This is not a diary that's going to have ""She makes it..."" blah blah. That's not cool. No going into all that ish. 

Well I have about another hour to go so perhaps I'll email Miss. Monica while I wait for all my stuff to be moved over so I can burn my work onto a CD."

"event","April's birthday is coming up soon and i don't know if i should get her a present or not. When I was getting dressed for school today i actually got the thought that maybe she doesn't want me to buy her one. This made me think. I don't know rather it would make her feel like she needs to buy me one for my own birthday or what it is. I really don't like it when people buy someone a present only because they got one for them last year. I was worried about this last christmas when i got Monica's family stuff. I hope they don't think they should give me anything this christmas. Cause yes, I hope to still be with Monica this upcoming christmas. Christmas with her was really great. I really liked opening presents so close to her and always getting a hug and being able to kiss her and stuff. It was really great. Warm Fuzzies.

It's a bummer I can't share this diary sometimes. Diaries sometimes are a real bummer i think.

I've gotten a good amount of my book read this week. I really em in love with that book. I hope our english teacher doesn't give us our book just yet so I can get some more reading in.

So I really like photography and photo manipulation and computer graphic art stuff ya know. And so I've been asking for a digital camera so maybe i could just fool around and then i got kelli to agree in letting me borrow her camera to test it out. I wonder though if i'll ever get it in my hands to take home. I decided not to ask anymore cause i'm kinda scared. I don't want to suck at it cause then it's not fun. You know me, I'm the kind that prefers the dream over the real thing. I'm just scared I wont be any good and wont like it anymore.  

For a week now i keep coughing and i have no idea why. It's sorta annoying bringing a water bottle around with me to class all the time. 

I heard that Coldplay song again this morning before going into class. It makes me sad whenever I heard it. The first time I heard it was when I drove myself back from visiting Monica at the hospital and it was late and I had the window down a little and it was a nice time but sad to because I had to leave Monica and I was scared for her. It still makes me a little sad but I really do like the song a lot for being able to change my feelings. It kind of makes me feel ""infinite""."

"event","Well, I only have 20 minutes to update this puppy but here it goes.

Monica has appendicitis!! Well, at lest a week ago. I don't really understand when the stopping point is for things like that. But she's alright, she's home now. Basically she's tired of it always hurting and wants to get out of the house but she still cant. I wish she could cause i would love to drive her around somewhere. 

How do you feel about reading someone's diary but i don't exactly know them. I only know who they are but never intend on meeting them or becoming friends with them? I'm very weird about people's diaries. Okay i'm just very weird period but. 

Lately i've found a friend of a friend's diary and am shock as to what kind of a person she is. Now is this fair? Even if i don't intend on getting to ever know her. I mean, making the judgment when i don't even know her? Well but I suppose this is her. I mean it's HER diary and her life. It's a public diary obliviously. And i guess if I ever did get to know her these are the kinda things I suppose i'd find out anyway. 

I had this strange dream a couple nights ago and i'm still thinking about it. It's one of those thoughts that just make you sit quietly and not have much motivation to move about. It's scary. And i hope to everything that it never happens. It makes me shut my mouth and never want to do anything ever again. 

I got new pills for my skin. Bleh. They suck to because at first it was a really high dosage and although it was working I had to stay home from school for 3 days because I had really high temperatures. Now I'm on half the dosage and it doesn't work, not to mention it's caused me to throw up twice. About a year ago they gave me a different kind of pill and i think it should be labeled as a torcher pill. It's the worst kind of pain i've felt. And it makes me throw up uncontrollably. I'm that desperate though. I really am. 

Let's just say I'm glad now we didn't go to Randy's."

Monica's mom is also sick. monica!!! don't get sick little miss!!! Please, for my sake. My brother stayed home from work today. Why didn't anyone tell me I could stay home from school today? Argy.

I brought my ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower"" book to read in school now. That's my favorite book. I've read it at lest 2 times. Maybe 3. I hope that goes well and i continue reading it. If you liked ""Catcher in the Rye"" it's kinda like that but not assss good. Heh. And believe me. I'm one of thoes ""i hate reading"" people. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is written in form of a diary of a boy growing up in high school and all that stuff. Well whatever. I like the book okay. 

Err. I hate this class so darn much. I can't do any cotton picken projects."

I went to Congressman Pete Stark's Town Meeting today. It was boring. The facts that i was feeling miserably sick also help make me want to get out of there as soon as possible. I don't see how I'm going to be able to write a 2-4 page letter about my ""political meeting experience"". Most of the subjects flew right over my head like most stuff. I fell really politically challenged for that hour. I went in hopes to get extra credit. There seems to be couple chances in getting extra credit for that class and i'm gobbling up what i can.

Yesterday was an interesting day. Our school had a Career Fair and my ROP class was sent to go talk to sophomores about the class and sorta get students interested in it. I spent a lotta stressed time the day before getting our t-shirts ready and sample of stuff we make in the computer graphic design class. I don't know if it paid off really. I don't think myself or the other 3 really got anyone else interested in the class. But what em i to do. Holly was also there for her veterinarian training ROP class but no one else showed up so she was forced to hang out with me. Heh. But it was cool because she never complained that i wasn't talking much or didn't seem interested in what she had to say. That helps when people don't do that. 

At lunch Holly also amazed me. You know those suckers with real bugs like mealworms or crickets. Well someone we knew had a sucker with a mealworm in it and Holly decided she'd eat it. Worm and all. I told her i'd give her a dollar and an extra 50 cents if i heard it crunch. Let me tell you this, she wasn't enjoying it to much but no one could really tell. We were all gagging and making faces as she calming and quietly crunched away at the bug. Didn't bother her a bit. She even picked the guts out of her teeth when she was done. Way to go Holly. It entertained me for 2 minutes at lest. I would definitely not compete against her in fear factor.

Diaries are evil because i'm suppose to be moving on and not let anything bother me. I'm going to try that method instead of taking it out on my arms or my girlfriend. Maybe i'll go back to writing as some sort of outlet. Just hoping the keyboard soaks it up so i wont say anything else or imply that i have feelings or any sort of emotions other then the positive ones again. But who know.

I want to call monica and ask if i can see her today but after all the shit yesterday im just to bossy. Last night though, when we kissed. I can't stop thinking about it. It felt really peaceful. She says she thinks we are going to make it. I honestly don't understand why she says that. Is it so shes not in denial? Is it just to help her. Would she said no if she thought that? I'm scared. She wanted me to fake things yesterday. I wish i could but after alecia i don't know how too. When i do call her i hope she's awake. I'll be so upset if she was sleeping. 

My legs are so sore yesterday because i ran back to her house and now they just hurt because im lazy and they arnt use to it.

"event","I'm glad you came around today
I sure need a good companion
I'm losing it but you're the same
without you I move at random
Abusing you 'cause you're a friend
and there's no Jesus here to explain

You justify, you're not afraid
and I won't feel like this forever
You wait with me, because you know
there's so much more than this before we go"

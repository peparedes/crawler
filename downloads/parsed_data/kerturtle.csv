"event","I really thought life was going ok until I got a call about a week ago telling me that one of my good friends from back in the high school days from the rink, Adam Bridges, had been in another wreck and she would call me back...so I never heard back from her and went on with my week cause I never really talked to him anymore due to life choices....Well I got a call from his SISTER friday while at bible study and said you need to come see Adam cause he has been moved to ICU and is having breathing problems... Then I knew it was bad.  Just so you know in Aug 2002 he was in a surver car accident and was in ICU for a long time where he broke A BUNCH Of bones and was in Health South from like 2 months so he was just getting off his walker three days before the wreck....I went up to see him tonight and It killed me.  They told me that there not sure he will ever walk again...He hit a tree on Plummer rd in Madison and has crushed all his bones in both his legs. He was driving 2 other people but glad there doing pretty good!  I really cant believe he has this bad luck...I really miss the days when he was my ""Marshallow Man""....

So now I am depressed and really cant stop thinking about what I would do if I lost my brother!!  I really just want someone to take this pain out of my chest but then again I rather take the pain from him and let him beable to walk again....PLEASE PRAY For him and his family....they got a long road ahead of them!! Buying a new house cause they cant get a wheelchair thru the doors and all the doctor visits all over again. 

I really am going to stay distant from here because I am not sure what to think....Please pray for me too!  I cant lose another friend to something like a car accident!! God is Great but sometime I wondered why things happen the way they do?!?!?"

Life is pretty good...I have really been in contact with this guy friend of mine that is stationed in Iraq and I really hope things go uphill from now..He comes back in October and i cant wait to see him.  I was having a bad day the other day and he mailed me a teddy bear so I had something cuddle with. He is a true sweet heart!  He has called a few times but I dont know to think if it is more then just friends or just needed a friend to talk to.  I really like him but I dont want to get my hopes up for something.  Today I said I needed some loving and he goes go find you a guy at the bar so that makes me think he doesnt care...but then again he talks about a possible future of going to Tunica or Six Flaggs....I just sit back and let it do its course...but that is also hard to sit back cause I saw where he is shouting out to some pretty girl on his website...  I do have the jealousy issue that I try to deal with but I am a girl that wants all the attention!!  Am I crazy??

I went to the doctor as soon as I could get in to find out I have blisters in my left ear.  I cant hear anything out of it....and it is painful.  I was put on some antibotics and pain killers..that was Tuesday.  

Today I ended up in the ER because it wasnt getting better and I was vomitting all night last night.  I really wanted to see a ENT so they said that was the best way to see them cause they would get the ENT oncall to come see me.  He did and he said i have Shingles in my ear...(Type of chicken pox)...  he gave me styeroids and more pain meds and sent me home...So that is where I am now...Home, cant hear and all drugged up!!

So Mercy Me is going to be fun to hear...one sided. So if you see me make sure you make eye contact with me if your going to talk to me cause It is really hard for me to understand stuff cause it sounds funny.  Much love, KAREN BETH!!!"

"event","Wow...I never thought after a good day that I had yesterday with being in a good mood and watching a good movie, Paying it forward, that today would turn out soo depressing and acting upsetting!  This morning was ok, it was a clinic day, so with patients in and out I didnt really have anytime to think but when I got back from lunch and it was calm and cold and rainy I just really got down and depressed.  I am really lonely!  I really dont think I have ever felt like this before..I have been lonely and had friends there to run to but when your by your self and have no one anywhere close to you and you just feel like everything is going wrong...that would be me today!  I was excited cause my friend Daniel called eariler and I got to talk to him for a min at lunch but when I got back online he wasnt really in to talking..and then I got to talkin to my friend Patrick and he is excited about getting out of huntsville and I wanted to see if he wanted to do something this weekend but he is busy. I understand, most people have a life but it makes me sad cause I dont want him to go...and then I added Byron back to my buddylist and he was on so I just said a little message to him but I said the wrong thing and made him frustrated and there is nothing in the world I want to make him mad so I have now decided I just going to keep my mouth shut... I hate people getting ill with me but I just want a friend to talk to and I keep getting shut down. Maybe I need to leave the internet alone and if someone really wants to talk to me they can call me..but then I will never hear from anyone!!  If I moved away, do you think I really will be missed??  *tear* I bet not!  My feelings are all bunched up inside me and I have done a good job with being happy and not complaining but I couldnt do it anymore!  I am sick of apoligizing for all my stupid mistakes I do..why am I sooo stupid..why do I say the things I say, why do I assume, why do I make people frustrated?  WHY WHY WHY!!!  All I can say is I dont know and I do appoligize!  I love my friends too much to hurt them but I seem to do it all the time!! I just want to be loved like I love them!  Is that possible??  One day I hope to find happiness...until then.. KB <><"

As like Nikki said...Does the holidays bring people down and my answer is yes...I think if your lonely and by yourself the holidays make it worse...I miss my baby overseas but I know that If i stick in there he will be with me once again..Hopefully sooner then later.  And if he isnt the one for me God will show me who I am susposed to be with...I just need to keep Beliving and praying...  Has anyone seen Polar Express?? I think that movie was great for Adults to put the Beliving back in the air.

It was good time to spend away from here and the same old things...I really thought about my life and I really want to move there and get a flight attendant job and then also work at disney!!  I think it would be great!!"

It made me feel refresh and energized but now it is the start of the new week and I am already feeling down.  Why I cant keep that feeling going all the time just really bugs me?!?!"

"event","Damn what an weekend.  Friday afternoon I went out to my car to find that my covertable top of my car the vinyl had pulled away from the glass.  So I am having to get a new top on my car...there goes 700 dollars.  Now the question is do I want plastic or glass window. It is a 100 dollar different. I dont know what to do but it is going to wipe out my saved money for a trip I was planning :-(  

But then I woke up Saturday and went to KY for a wedding.  I HAD A BLAST!  Dance til my mom made us leave..she was getting tired and we were going to my uncles to stay.  It was a church friend and so there was church people every where plus BEER...It was great! 

So today we are driving back and then I am hitting the church for a Halloween Mission project at the hospital!  I am excited about that!"

I layed in bed and watched TV and then about 11pm my friend got online and we talked for an hour or so but my head was killin me and my eyes were seeing double so I let him go to try to sleep but I didnt get to sleep til almost 5.   My alarm going off at 7 was way too early!  I think I am going to sleep thru lunch! I would be taking a nap here at work but it is surgery day so the doctor could walk thru any minute and that wouldnt be good.   Damn if life could get any worse I rather just go live in Heaven!!!"

"event","Weekend Update!!!

Friday- Drove down to Auburn to hear my band, None the Weiser, play at the Superclub and was out til 5:30am. I had a blast..everyone needs to go hear them on Dec. 11 @ the Station in Madison.  

Saturday- Got up at 9:30 and got ready for the game..was at the game by 12. I sat in the student section and had more fun watching the cops catch people with beer and such which was funny.  We won 42-10 so it kind-of boring after a while but I finally got to see all the Toliet Paper at Toomers Corner!!  We went as a family to Red Lopster that night and then I hit the bed at 9:45.

Sunday- Got up at 8 and went to a Pancake Breakfast at my brothers church and then went to there service.  After that we ate and then came home so I could make it to youth by 6. Drove to TN last night around 10 and slept good.

Monday- Here at work...BORED. Talked to my baby today and he is going to call me around 5.  I miss him but one day I will get to see him.  

So hope I didnt put you to sleep with all that info.  Talk to you all later. KB"

"event","<font color=""#800040"">hey everybody how are you today??? well there is really nothing going on except i have like 2 HSA tests to do in two different classes. and the teachers are acting like this is really supposed to make us focus, when really all it is doing is making us bored out of our minds, trying to drill like a whole year of stuff in one freakin review. i dunno it is really weird, how some teachers think that we care, because quite honestly i don't i would rather stay at home and clean then, have to got to school, take tests that don't really concern me much, and be around stuck up people just freakin full of themselves. i dunno maybe i am just a fag, maybe i am. but oh well like it really matters. but nothing really happenig, just trying to make plans for the summer right now. i would like to go visit shannen's boyfriend's family in Minnesota, i would also like to see my dad, and then try to spend time with my family here. so i have alot of places to go, and very little time to really do it. there are so many boy problems that i am going through. I think i am in love with this boy David(not shanne's dave), but my dave...i think that i completely love him. i think about him all the time, and all i think about is kissing him, but for some reason when i look at him, i only think of him as a friend, but then when i am alone, and i am not seeing him, i can't do anything but thnk about him. it is extremely weird, and i don't know which emotion to fall back on. so maybe if anyone knows what i am going through, and as a little advice on whati could do, you would be helping me alot if you would just help me out, because i don't know what to do. maybe i should try going out with him, just to see what it would be like. maybe i would figure out which one i feel more. well g2g , talk to you later. love ya'll tootles

peace out danielle"

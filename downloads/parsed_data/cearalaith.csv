"event","Does anyone have experience with adopting from Yolo County SPCA?

As most of y'all know, T-Man has been aching for a dog for years -- and we're finally getting one.  He fell in love with <a href=""http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13413608"">a sweet little pup named Pluto</a> at the YSPCA PetSmart appearance on April 4, and I turned in an application for her that day.  I sent a follow-up e-mail on the 10th, wanting to make sure everything was in order, and got a (seemingly very automatic) reply advising me that they'd received a lot of applications for Pluto, they were still reviewing them and they try to call prospective adopters within seven days.  I waited another week before sending another follow up, and I've had no reply.

Is this typical?  I'm led to believe that Pluto's ad remaining on Petfinder means she has not been adopted out.  If they've dismissed our application, I'd like to know why so I know if I should bother applying for any other animals (for example: if I just randomly lost the Everyone Wants A Cute Puppy Lottery, that's one thing, but if they have a blanket Do Not Adopt Dogs policy for people who do not have fenced yards, I'll know not to bother reapplying.  If it's something that can be fixed, I'd like to know so I can <i>fix</i> it.)  I'd at <i>least</i> like to know at what point I should figure that No News Is Bad News and start looking at other dogs -- and their policy doesn't even give me that much!  I am not sure where the line is drawn between making fair inquiries and bein an annoyance. Help?"

"event","...somehow, I did <i>not</i> get a surplus letter.  

I have verified that it is not a mail failure.  Apparently four years as a State Monkey <i>is</i> long enough to save you from the warning of the caution of the threat of the possible axe.  Who would have thought?  Not me.

I know I should be totally thrilled that I'm NOT at risk of layoff!  But I just feel kinda... weird.  Maybe because I had convinced myself that I WAS going to get one?  And a lot of people in my office have gotten them (including several I like) and I just feel strange to not be among them.  

In particular, learning that one of my coworkers who got the letter has three years made me feel weird.  I have sent an e-mail to a contact at my old department to find out how things have gone down there.  The calculation was done by department, and it would be interesting to know if I would have been on the list had I stayed."

"event","Tonight I walked down the street behind a very beautiful Batgirl as she skipped and spun around and declared ""This is the best Halloween I have ever had in my whole entire <i>life!</i>""

Two minutes later the sky opened up and started dumping on us.  

We'd been trick-or-treating for all of thirty minutes and (as our street is fairly dead until you get down to the corner) had hit maybe six houses, two of which were the nobody-home-but-the-candy-bowl variety.  

Sprinkling would have been one thing -- heck, by that time it had <i>been</i> sprinkling.  But this was <i>pouring</i>.  And... T's helmet has electronics in it, and his cardboard pauldrons were quickly wrinkling and running.  Doodlebug's costume offered decent protection from cold and wind but left her very vulnerable to the wet.  Bean was well-covered, but already fighting a cold.  The kids had <i>paper</i> treat bags.  I knew we had no umbrellas at home.  I didn't feel we had much choice.

I promised that we would go back out if the rain let up, but no such luck.  

The kids still got lots of candy; as we had no trick-or-treaters <i>come</i> to our house either, the traditional last stop (home) was also the most profitable.  But the disappointment was palatable.  I tried my best to stay upbeat and offer fun alternatives -- movies and cupcakes -- but secretly I was just thankful the bags gave out <i>after</i> we got home.

"event","Every time I go months without posting I feel this need to <i>explain</i> when I post again.  Sometimes this imagined need delays the actual posting.  Frequently, actually. 

Unfortunately there's not much to explain.  I've been busy; unfortunately not with much worth writing <strike>home</strike> on LJ about.  I keep thinking I'll do stuff ""this evening"" or ""tomorrow"" but then I never have the time I think I will.  I suppose that's just life but for some reason I'm not accustomed to it.  Writing on LJ still falls behind writing thank-you notes, which I was officially overdue on about four months ago.  And then I keep taking on new projects that seem like they won't take much time at all (letting my galliard challenge for Den Mother) and wind up feeling terrible when I fall behind.  Even when I try to be <i>proactive</i> I fall behind.  And, well, bah.

In news that is new: I've been offered a promotion!  I was actually fairly certain I <i>hadn't</i> gotten the position, since I interviewed three weeks ago, heard they were checking my references two and a half weeks ago and then heard <i>nothing more</i> until today.  I suspect I may have originally been their second choice, but since they came to their senses I shall not complain.  Actually I have spent most of the day squee-ing, and trying to figure out when I can go through my wardrobe to figure out what's still usable and what I have to buy (and where the heck I'm going to get the money before I get my miniscule raise).  I won't miss schlepping blueprints every day, but I will miss wearing blue jeans.

In different news, it seems I shall have a fireman, a stormtrooper and Batgirl at my house for Halloween.  This marks the first year that Bean has not been afraid of Halloween (seriously, last year he freaked out when we went <i>near</i> the orange and black aisles in <i>Target</i>) and I'm very excited!  I'm also excited to be helping throw Doodlebug's class party on Oct 30, even though I had totally forgotten I'd volunteered to do so until the friendly reminder e-mail showed up on Monday.  Eeeek!

I don't know if I'm doing NaNoWriMo this year.  I want to -- I <i>always</i> want to -- but I'm thinking this year that it might be better <i>not</i> to add one more bullet item to my list of Undone Things To Feel Bad About.  Maybe I'll just help <lj user=craymore> with his (as much as I ever manage to ""help"", anyway....)"

"event","Well, me and about 4000 other lucky <a href=""http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com"">PAX</a> attendees.  I also had ""Fancy Pants"" stuck in my head for the rest of the weekend.  <i>Fancy Pants</i>.  Why couldn't it have been ""Skullcrusher Mountain""?!?  (Which will be available at some future point for Rock Band, it seems, and I cannot wait.)

Felicia Day is <i>very nice</i> -- like, seriously, exceptionally nice; very friendly and personable -- and actually, kinda surprisingly, prettier than she is on film.  We missed the MC Frontalot concert, but picked up his new CD the next day, and he was also very nice -- he always gives off the ""I'm still a geek and deathly uncomfortable being even-sorta-<i>kinda</i> famous"" vibe, but it comes off very cute -- Windows crashed on him while he was trying to run our card, and Front got terribly flustered about it, and was very grateful when we volunteered to just run to the ATM instead.  The line for Wil Wheaton was always way too fucking long, which made me sad.

The <i>Rock Band II</i> demo had a line that went around the stage twice -- and most of the people who got up were really, amazingly good.  (They were all playing Hard or Expert on songs they'd presumably never seen before, and doing <i>well</i>.  By contrast, my guitar skill maxes out at a reliable Medium, and I can only manage to sing two songs on Expert.)  The <i>Guitar Hero: World Tour</i> demo had a line about two bands deep, and it seemed that every single one played ""Livin' On a Prayer"", and mostly badly.  Now, the GH:WT drum kit looked pretty sweet, and I kind of have to assume that there are at least a <i>few</i> other, equally playable songs on the list.  But I still think the prospects for both games are pretty clear.

On Saturday I participated in a SingStar contest and completely mauled ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" in front of probably a hundred people.  I would say that it was because I couldn't hear the music, and was having to time myself based solely on the visuals -- which was true, and a big problem was how badly I got off-track based on my <i>memory</i> of the tempo, adjusted for nerves  But in all truth, it does hit in a tricky part of my range, so I might not have done much better if I <i>could</i> have heard it.  :-P

<lj user=craymore> came out the big swag winner -- they were doing comic trivia at the Champions Online booth, and he answered a question about ""PS 238"" to win a Champions backpack, a t-shirt, and a <i>skateboard</i>.  We also both got all sorts of posters and shirts and postcards and temporary tattoos and other, random, completely <i>wackass</i> shit.  We each got a Magic mousepad, and a Dragon Age <i>tattoo sleeve</i> (do people actually wear these things?  I mean, when they're not at conventions where every other geek who sat through the demo is also wearing one?), and a fingerless glove from some gaming website we've never heard of.  Adam got a metal... thing for Castle Crashers, and I got a stuffed animal from Twin Skies.

Speaking of <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, the game looks really beautiful.  <i>Warhammer Online</i> had a really pretty trailer up.  <lj user=craymore> is very interested in Fallout 3, but at no point were we willing to wait hours to go through the demo and jump through eight zillion hoops to get a poster or a handpuppet.

<lj-cut text=""There were some down points to PAX as well.  Cut to spare mood."">
<a href=""http://www.wizards.com"">Wizards of the Coast</a> had a well-stocked, well-attended booth.  I haven't been to enough conventions to know if that was, in fact, their A game, but they did a decent job of meeting the fans and fulfilling their expectations -- in sharp contrast to, say, <a href=""http://www.ccpgames.com"">CCP</a>/<a href=""http://www.white-wolf.com"">White Wolf</a>, who set up a ginormous EVE booth (which you couldn't really get into, because the same people would camp out in there for days) and filled it with assholes who (except for one guy) not only could not/<i>would</i> not answer your White Wolf/WoD questions but were <i>nasty</i> about it besides.  It was extra disappointing because <lj user=craymore> and I had been lead to expect better from past experience, and from actually meeting a CCP guy by the name of John on our way to the convention.  John shared some very cramped space with us on the very full bus from the airport (he explained that everyone else from CCP had flown in the day before, but he'd stayed behind to finish up work) and we had a great conversation about gaming... and generally, we parted with the impression that if John was an example of who we'd meet from CCP, then we were in for a great experience!  But no, it turns out that while John <i>was</i> the sort of awesome guy who'd stay late to make sure everything got covered, everyone <i>else</i> was exactly the sort of jerk who'd take off early and let someone else handle the cleanup.  Very disappointing.

Saturday, in general, was kind of a bust.   The whole experience felt more like Generic Convention X than the <i>Penny Motherfuckin' Arcade Expo</i>.  We didn't see Gabe or Tycho once all weekend -- and now, not spotting Gabe, that's not too surprising... but Tycho was everywhere last year.  Too many people.  Not enough space -- and it wasn't like (what I've heard of) PAX'06, where everyone was crammed in like sardines but were generally cool about it; no, the best way I found to describe it was that the general ""douchebag factor"" was much higher this year.  You get a lot of people in one place and put them in less-than-luxury conditions (i.e., any convention) and people either choose to be cool, mellow and understanding about it, or they choose to be douchebags... and this year, more people chose to be douchebags.  It took me twenty minutes to get in and out of a booth to buy a single poster, because every time I negotiated with one or two other decent people to trade places/make a path, some douchebag would push or jump into the open space and block it again (frequently preventing the nice person who moved from getting back to where they just were).  And that just doesn't make for fun.  And as of Saturday night at dinner, the four of us (me, <lj user=craymore>, <lj user=karleeneedsleep>, <lj user=metrophelean> were all kinda feeling that that summed up this year's PAX: too much waiting, too much pushing, too much attitude, not enough fun.  

Sunday, however, really kinda redeemed it.  Crowds had fractionally lessened, people were in a generally better mood, and it was more like the PAX we remembered from last year.  So <lj user=craymore> and I <i>did</i> leave feeling like we'd do it again next year.</lj-cut>


Oh, I almost forgot! Man-Peach was back.  There were two Dr. Horribles (one red coat, one white -- and the white carried a case of Wonderflonium).  There was a nurse from <i>Silent Hill</i>.  There were a few zombies.  There was a Vivi, with glowing eyes!There was a Yuffie, and a couple characters from <i>Devil May Cry</i>.  The cosplay contest sponsored by Hothead generated a lot of snappy 1920's costumes... and a Fruit Fucker.  We saw him only briefly, rattling as he chased a bunch of shrieking convention-goers down an escalator.  <i>That</i> was the moment, for me, that it really felt like PAX.

So overall, despite difficulties, I had fun at PAX and I'd do it again next year... but <lj user=craymore> and I did spend the plane ride home talking about what we'd do <i>differently</i> next year to maximize our fun.  Among our ideas: <lj-cut text=""This is a longer post than I originally anticipated."">
<ol><li>DRIVE.  Dear god, we are driving next year.  Flying seemed like such a good idea -- it saves so much time! -- but it turned out to be more expensive than we planned, getting to and from the airport was a major hassle, being on a strict schedule caused stress, and although we don't <i>need</i> a car in Seattle, it would have been nice to have one.  By contrast, driving may take longer, but with the car comes travel flexibility, and splitting the cost makes it <i>so</i> cheap (and the more people we can get to go, the cheaper it gets!) -- and frankly road trips are fun.</li>  
<li>Go to the keynote speech and first PA Q&A on Friday.  We skipped them this year in favor of trying to get deeper into the overcrowded Expo hall.  In retrospect, this was a mistake -- the keynote and Q&A really kinda set the tone in '07, and we missed that this year.  The Expo hall will be there all weekend.  Speaking of which...</li>
<li>Avoid the Expo hall on Saturday.  It's the busiest day, particularly because it's the day all the casual enthusiasts come.  Douchebag factor was definitely highest that day.  Exhibitors are in a bad mood, because they're so busy; swag counts drop.  And there's just too much other stuff to do to make fighting that battle worthwhile.  This means that...</li>
<li>Saturday is the day for panels, and for <i>naps</i>.  Waiting in line with your DS for an fascinating panel is so much less exhausting than fighting your way through a crowd of jerks to get to kinda half-peer over someone's shoulder at something that may not be well-made or interesting anyway.  And if there aren't any good panels for two hours, well, that's a good sign that you should take a nap so you can be awake for the concerts.  Three out of four of us were out cold and snoring before 11pm on Saturday this weekend... and I don't think that's what any of us <i>planned</i> on when we were thinking about this trip.  Which means....</li>
<li>Sunday is the day for the Expo hall.  Not that Friday needs to be skipped, because that first rush is fun.  But crowds are down, exhibitors are relaxed (and generous -- they don't want to pack their swag back home!) and generally it's a better experience.</li></ol> </lj-cut>

Home now, and glad.  Catching up on LJ will take days.  If I missed something important, wave, okay?"

This recounting is going to take a couple of posts.  :-)  And it's only a couple of weeks late!

<lj-cut text=""Before the wedding..."">

My mom found me passable shoes at PayLess on Thursday evening (May 29); white wedges, size 9 wide.  They weren't <i>the perfect shoes</i>, but they fit and they looked nice and they would last four hours so I was pleased.  

<lj user=cork_dork> came in later that night, and after we spent a lot of time hugging and arguing with the morons at the car rental stand, he told me that the two big non-wedding things he wanted to do while in to California were:

1) Go wine shopping.
2) Get an In-N-Out burger.

So, deciding that there was no time like the present, that night he and I and <lj user=craymore> shared a delicious white (Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc) with our Double-Doubles and fries.  <lj user=cork_dork> will have to remind me what one it was.  :-D  I don't think it was the <i>original idea</i>, but it was a fabulous way to kick off the fun.

The next day <lj user=cork_dork> went off to his work-based excuse for flying cross-country, and I spent the entire day panicking to bits.  I got out to Costco, and to my last dress fitting (Leslie had to measure me with the shoes and hem the skirt) and a couple of other errands in the morning... but the fitting took an extra-long time while we fixed a problem with the corset, and by the time I got home in mid-afternoon I just felt paralyzed by everything left to do.  My mom and <lj user=fireopal88> really came to the rescue, there, and got me through a couple of beauty routines before we all whisked off to the rehearsal.
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/cearalaith/pic/00016fa9/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/cearalaith/pic/00016fa9/s320x240"" width=""169"" height=""240"" border='0' align=left wrap=right hspace=10 vspace=10/></a>
The rehearsal and dinner went lovely, and smoothly.  I saw my ring for the first time, and my dad told everyone he could get ahold of its history.  Which is, in short:

My great-grandfather Carl Baker gave this diamond ring to my great-grandmother Catherine at their wedding in 1914.  They divorced years later, after my grandmother (my father's mother) was born; after Catherine died, Grandma Caryl had the stones reset into a necklace and wore it for many years.  But at news that <lj user=craymore> and I were planning our wedding, she offered both stones and the original setting to me if I wanted them -- and if I didn't want the original setting, she'd have it reset however I wanted.  Well, I love the original setting and so that's what I have (resized, because Great-Grandma Catherine had teensy fingers).  I understand that my Dad went on about the cut and clarity and whatnot of the diamonds, but I think it's a wonderful ring just for the history behind it and I'm honored to have it.

(<lj user=craymore>'s ring, in the same pic, belonged to my dad; he wore it for his short-lived second marriage, and gave it to us with his simple wishes that it brings us more joy.  Not as awesome a story, but still a nice ring.)

I wish I could remember more of the dinner now.  It was a wonderful time with close friends and it all just kinda blends together into one happy blur.

After dinner <lj user=cork_dork> took me to pick up the wine for the wedding, and <lj user=craymore> and half the bridal party went to A-1 Comics... and while I wouldn't have passed up the errand I was on, I did kinda regret not getting to go with them.  Which really, <i>really</i> says a lot about us as a group.

Then home again, to (not) sleep before the big day.

The next morning I actually made <lj user=cork_dork> play bridesmaid for an hour by taking me to my makeup appointment.  Hey, he was there, willing and able; he had a car, and wasn't in a hurry to get his own hair or makeup done!  He also took pictures and was generally awesome.  Then <lj user=barelyproper> and <lj user=karleeneedsleep> appeared like magic and whisked me off to get dressed, and then to my dad's house for the ceremony."

"event","I've now had half of my root canal.  I still have to go back so they can finish it up.  It's not as bad as I was expecting!  ...which, granted, is a low bar to clear.  But really, Dr. Min is nice and efficient, and I've had very little pain.  I also like Dr. Menicou, the dentist <lj user=karleeneedsleep> recommended to me (even though I snicker every time his staff address him as ""Doctor Nik"") and will be going back to him.... assuming I don't completely chicken out now that the pain has stopped.  I hope I don't chicken out.

Work progresses.  No hospitals have fallen down lately, and I like to pretend that I had something to do with that.  However, my Bean chewed up my earphones tonight (why did he do that?!?  I thought he'd outgrown that phase!?!?) so filing and bus-riding is going to be really boring for some time.

The house next to Panda's is on the market.  5br/3ba, built 1973, slight fixer, on greenbelt, near schools and parks.  It's pretty much my ideal house -- as in, even a couple of years ago I'd observed it and thought ""That would be an awesome house for my family.""  But even in this depressed real estate market, it's priced at $475,000 (which is actually awesome for a house in Davis).. meaning that even if I had a twenty percent down (I don't) and awesome credit (I don't) it would still cost me $100 more per month than I actually <i>bring home</i>.  Yet for some reason I have this pervasive and frustrating feeling of ""so close, yet so far"" and this nagging voice wondering if I could somehow make it work... which is ridiculous, because I'm not close at all.  When I'm thirty cents short to buy milk at the supermarket and I get this feeling, I can scrounge through sofa cushions and make up the difference.  This would require <i>a really fucking big sofa</i>... and I know it's not happening, so I wish I could make my brain stop turning it over.

I have ice cream and it is delicious.  Now I just want <lj user=craymore> to get home."

Right now there's a lot going on in my life, and most of it is good.  Even the Great Flood of 2008 seems to have been a blessing in disguise, as the more the maintenance dudes work on the repairs the more underlying damage they find -- and while the damage itself is not good, finding it now instead of when one of the kids falls through the floor is <i>very</i> good.  But it's all very stressful.  I'm at the point where I am stressing about how stressed I am.  And I think I've delegated as much as I can -- and I'm afraid I'm not much help to the chosen delegates at the moment, but I'll try to get better -- so I don't think it's really that I have too much to do right now.  It's more that it's taking a great deal of effort not to just run around in circles flailing my arms and crying ""AAAAAH! TOO MUCH STRESS! AAAAAAH!""  

My life's getting awesomer every day and I can't complain.  But if it seems like I'm freaking the fuck out lately: it's really because I am.  But it's okay, because things will return to normal soon.  At least I really hope they do."

And I post it here specifically to note that I kind of wish I actually knew Mike Krahulik -- or had even had the opportunity/guts to walk up and introduce myself to him and/or Jerry at PAX last year -- because <i>I relate</i>, and I'd like to tell him I relate... but there are probably eight gazillion goobery fans bombarding him with e-mails as it is... and if the way he endured being the center of that kind of attention at PAX is any indication, I don't need to add to the anonymous stack.  Probably especially under the circumstances.

I wish him luck, is all I can say.  I hope Jerry and Kara are being supportive... it looks like Jerry's trying, even if he doesn't Get It (and I'm not sure he doesn't), and that's all anyone can really ask for.

And I was thinking about it already, but it's helped bolster my resolve: after putting it off for months (and subjecting <lj user=craymore> and kids to all sorts of unpleasant swings during that time), I'm gonna make some calls this week, with the goal of getting back on Paxil and back into therapy.  It'll be good for me <i>and</i> for the people around me."

I've liked every performance of his I've seen -- even the ones in some otherwise really mediocre movies like <i>The Patriot</i>.  He's got a lot of depth for a young actor, and I've been really looking forward to his future work.  And of course, I've been looking forward to <i>The Dark Knight</i>...oh, only for years now.

"event","Friday morning I found out that the shop owner told Hero Coworker that the fire started while he was welding a fuel tank with an acetylene torch.  The ""earth-shattering kaboom"" was most likely the acetylene tank going up, with the smaller pops being gas tanks and oil cans.

The general response from everyone else who I talked to about that was ""Fuel tank + acetylene torch?!?  How <i>stupid</i> can you get?!""  But there are proper ways of doing that... and the guy's been a mechanic in that location for <i>years</i> and years, so I doubt he was just being stupid.  I think it's a more likely, tragic possibility that he knew what he was doing but got careless in his confidence, and that's when such things happen.

As of yesterday, the shop owner was still in ICU in serious condition.  Which is still pretty terrible, but UCDMC has a fantastic burn center, so I'm feeling pretty optimistic for him.  It's really fortunate that he wasn't hurt worse, and amazing that no one else seemed to be hurt at all.  When we were watching the fire department cut open the fourth fire bay door, another coworker wondered aloud if they were still looking for someone... and I had the sobering realization that if anyone <i>was</i> in that back corner of the shop... well, they probably weren't there anymore.  It <i>really</i> could have been worse, and I'm glad it wasn't.

Friday was comparatively boring, and I was very glad of that as well."

"event","So at about 1:20 today, I walked by the front desk where our receptionist happened to be standing in the doorway looking outside.  She saw me and said ""Oh, Erin, look, there's a fire across the street,"" in the same dismayed tone of voice she uses when she says ""Oh, Erin, look, there's a paper jam in the fax machine,"" and pointed in the direction of the auto mechanic shop to the south of us.  So, curious and wishing to avoid work, I walked over and popped my head out, expecting to see a garbage can or something on fire.  

And, <i>no</i>.  There was flame on the ground all along the first auto bay and in front of the repair office.  And there were people running around, and I could hear a guy <i>screaming</i>.   

So I said ""Holy mother<i>fucking</i> shit"" in a tone I never use with the fax machine and I ran to the phone to call 911.  Then while I was on the phone with 911, there was an earth-shattering kaboom and the building shook.  Once off the phone I poked my head back out, and the entire front of the mechanic shop was engulfed in red-orange billowy flame and giving off wicked black smoke.  

It was really impressive.  And also really fucking scary.

About that time everyone else in my office came running out to see what caused the earth-shattering kaboom, and there was a good deal of ruckus all around.  I went back inside (because we could still hear the odd ""pop"" -- and having figured out that the original kaboom was a gas tank or an oil drum or something going up, I didn't want to be out on the street when another went off) and watched from a conference room window inside as the fire department showed up.  

I felt weird watching it, but I couldn't tear myself away.  Half my office was in the same boat.  I found out then that while I was on the phone, one of my coworkers (a former firefighter) actually <i>ran into the burning shop and got the owner out</i> -- someone else had seen him helping the owner roll on the ground and cut his burning clothes off.  When he came back, he said the owner was pretty badly burned but would probably be okay (and now that I'm home and can find out more, it looks like his was the only injury, thank god... which means he was probably the fellow I heard screaming).

The actual proper on-duty firefighters got there quickly and got to work right away.  <i>That</i> was also really impressive to watch.  It was some time in doing; at least twice it looked like they had it under control, only for something else to go up.  They actually cut open two steel bay doors to get in, and there was a new, sudden conflagration after each door opened thanks to the influx of oxygen. 

Eventually they did get it under control.  It seemed like it took a long time, but when I checked the clock it had only been about twenty minutes.  The fire was pretty much under control <a href=""http://www.kcra.com/news/15077516/detail.html"">by the time the news got there</a>.  And we were all gently told to get back to work... but truth be told, I didn't get much done.

So that was my workday.  How was yours?"

"event","I've not been on LJ lately because I've been in an absolute blue funk.  It's equal parts seasonal, stress, and lack of meds.  (Yes, I should totally get back on meds and back in therapy.  It's just so hard to <b>do</b> when I'm depressed!)  I'm managing and Adam's taking good care of me and all will be fine.  But if I'm seeming antisocial, it's 'cause I totally <i>am</i>, and it's me and not you and it'll get better soon.

Quick update: kids are great, Adam's great.  I passed the SSA exam, and get to start jobhunting (although I'm not in a hurry -- I really like my office, and I already make above minimum starting for SSA-A -- so I'm gonna take my time looking for the <i>right</i> position).  The master cylinder in the Honda is blown, so we're carless until my generous dad can fix it or help me get it fixed -- and actually, the most frustrating aspect of that is that Adam and I had just started practicing driving the week before, and now practice is on hold again.  We rearranged our bedroom furniture this weekend to accommodate a second computer desk.  Life continues apace."

However, due to the terrible weather (and the slew of complications spawned by the terrible weather -- PG&E, I'm looking disdainfully in your direction), the decision has been made to cancel Sticks & Stones for this evening.  We'll try again in two weeks (January 19).

"event","After Christmas festivities, <lj user=craymore> and I went to see <i>Sweeney Todd</i>.  It's <lj user=craymore>'s favoritest musical ever, and he loves Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, and he was positive that they were going to fuck it up even <i>with</i> Sondheim's blessing.  (I like the music but had never seen the show before and so didn't have such an attachment to the production.)  

They didn't fuck it up.  It was pretty good.  The ending was changed slightly (Toby doesn't quite snap the way he does in the stage show; then again, this is probably good, as he's about <i>nine</i>).  The singing was decent; Depp's voice <i>was</i> a little rockish (Sondheim's one complaint, according to teh intarwebs), but it sounded good and I felt he made up for what he might have lacked vocally with attitude; Adam thought it hurt ""Epiphany"", but I didn't notice.  So there you have it.  Also, Anthony was not a wuss, and that made us both happy. 

The people who were not happy were the ones watching the movie with us.  Aside from us, I think there were an entire four Tim Burton fans, and not a single Sondheim fan in the audience.  All the other individuals in the nearly packed theatre were Johnny Depp fans, and I suspect most of them were <i>Pirates</i> fans.  I saw a couple of kids -- not super-young kids, but kids nonetheless -- ten or eleven.  (I managed to refrain from walking up to their presumed parents and saying <i>Do you know what this movie is about?!?</i>  But perhaps I should not have.  Refrained.)  Judging by the laughter at the first few lines and comments throughout, a good portion of the audience did not realize ahead of time that <i>Sweeney Todd</i> is a <b>musical production</b>, replete with characters singing when they should be talking and singing <i>more</i> during scenes when any character in a not-musical would have just gone ahead and slit the judge's fucking throat already.  According to Adam, a couple of groups walked out; I was too busy watching the film to notice them.  No one laughed at ""A Little Priest.""  Not one, <i>not once</i>.

Ultimately, Adam and I agreed that if anything would have made <i>Sweeney Todd</i> better, it would have been seeing it with other fans of the musical.  But it was still pretty good."

<i>When you see this, post a picture of something that really scared you as a child.</i>

I was seven or eight, and I'd snuck out of bed with intent of finding out what the heck my parents did after my sister and I were supposed to be asleep.  I knew it <i>had</i> to be something super, amazingly awesome and fun, and it wasn't fair that I wasn't allowed to join in!  On most nights I would have discovered that the most fun stuff my parents did was watch the news and go to bed... but on this particular night, we'd just recently gotten HBO, and I got nice and comfy in my best hiding spot behind the couch just in time to watch <lj-cut text=""a scene in some really cool grownup movie that ended in this:"">a scene in some really cool grownup movie that ended in this:

Yes, that is <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i>, and it gave me nightmares for a week, until I finally had to fess up to my mom.  It was years before I was able to bring myself to watch the rest of the movie... and I still had to cover my eyes during that scene.  I still <i>do</i>."

"event","So this morning I fell in the shower.  I had gotten <i>out</i> of the shower to grab the razor that had been left by the sink, and I slipped getting back in.  I couldn't really pay attention to how I fell -- I was kind of in the middle of falling, after all -- but I imagine it was pretty spectacular; I banged up one arm but good and bashed my head at least twice.  And most spectacular of all, I somehow managed to cut my left ear right at the point where it joins my head, necessitating a trip to the emergency room.  The ER doc was pretty impressed that I managed to make a cut so deep and neat (about half a centimeter, but completely through flesh and cartilage) <i>with a safety razor</i> -- he even called a nurse in to show it off -- and really, I'm not sure I could have done it if I tried.  Now I'm home with stitches, and feeling okay, although my ear is achy and my boyfriend keeps insisting that I should tell people who ask about the stitches that I was attacked by pirates.  But really and vainly, I'm just glad that it should heal neatly, with only a little scarring that will blend into the natural creases, so I won't wind up looking like Mick Foley or Don Karnage or someone.  My heroes today are Panda, who drove me to the ER; <lj user=shlomo_yisrael>, who was willing to look at my ear and tell me how bad it was when I was panicking too much to do it myself (there was blood <i>everywhere</i>); and <lj user=craymore> who braved stupid receptionists and his own squeamishness to sit by me and hold my hand while I got sewn up.  Special thanks also to the inventors of novocaine, for reasons which should be self-evident."

"event","A few days ago we wound up receiving the previous resident's copy of Maxim magazine, and out of sheer curiosity I read through it.  It seems to be built off the same model as Playboy... but the articles are short, vague and unfocused (read: they suck), and all the girls keep their clothes on.  So I'm reading it, and I start to wonder... what's the point?  I'm aware that many men buy Maxim -- but why buy a magazine whose two major selling points are so clearly overshadowed by another publication?  Not to mention that Playboy also features better jokes, better interviewers, and a regularly fascinating advice column. I'd try comparing Maxim to Cosmopolitan instead... but <i>Cosmo</i> has better-written articles (if usually on shallower subjects), and that's saying something.  They also have quizzes, which really shouldn't be as fun as they are.

So it is a mystery to me.  In truth, I suspect the answer has something to do with the stigma attached to Playboy; that guys would rather buy an inferior product than risk their girlfriends flipping out unreasonably over their magazine selection.  But that also strikes me as a cheap-shot cop-out kind of answer, so I'm looking for others."

"event","We're actually having a Halloween party at work this year, with costumes and all.  On the upside, it means that this year I won't be the only person who dresses up on October 31!  On the downside... I was actually considering <i>skipping</i> the dress-up this year (for the first time in nearly thirty years) because I don't know what I want to be and it's hard to focus effort or funds on a costume if I'm not motivated.  So now I need to figure out what the hell I'm doing for Halloween.

I guess I could do a vampire.  I've got more than enough dramatic goth clothing, and makeup is cheap; I can finally spring for the tacky/awesome costume fangs.  I skipped it all those years I played Vampire LARP because well, it didn't seem special for Halloween anymore.  But it's been a while... that could be fun.

Maybe I'll come up with some other ideas.  We'll see."

The weekend was fun.  <lj user=craymore> had a good birthday, between his Friday night party and Saturday seeing <i>Jersey Boys</i> (which was fun; I'm not a real fan of the recent glurge of jukebox musicals, but I still had a good time).  And next week we're going to see They Might Be Giants in Sacramento (his gift from me and the kids), so the fun continues.  

But were I to say that last phrase aloud right now, it would come out as ""so the fuhd cuhdtidhues,"" and probably be punctuated with a cough or two.  So I'm heading back to bed.  I may be around on AIM later, but... y'know."

"event","From the California State Personnel Board Website: <blockquote><i>The Office Assistant (General and Typing) examination is offered on a continuous basis several times per month at the State Personnel Board's Testing Center. In order to take this examination, you must use the SPB online scheduling system. New test dates will be posted every Wednesday at 5:00 p.m. You are encouraged to complete your online State application in advance since this will allow you to expedite yourself through the scheduling process.</i></blockquote> If you've got at least two years' clerical experience, the testing for Office Technician is also open.  You can sign up to take either exam at <a href=""http://spb.ca.gov/employment/exam_start.htm"">http://spb.ca.gov/employment/exam_start.htm</a>; the exams are actually given at the SPB Testing Center in downtown Sacramento, and there is a YoloBus stop right there.  

OA and OT are the ""foot in the door"" position for state employment if you don't have a college degree.  (If you've got a Bachelor's, you get to skip straight to Staff Services Analyst Range C.  If you can type at a decent rate, take a typing test through SPB and you can be classed as an OA(T) or OT(T) -- susually the same job, but a little more money.)  Sure, sometimes it's monkey work, but it pays better than the same monkey work in the private sector and the benefits cannot be beat.  

If you have any questions pipe up.  I'm happy to answer, and I've got all sorts of family and friends (three or four of them here on LJ) in state service who can answer what I can't."

"event","<b>September 3!</b>  I have a moving truck reserved, and a 3:15pm appointment to pick up the keys. I figure we'll pack the truck in the morning, do a late lunch, pick up keys, do a 30-minute inspection, unpack, return the truck, and collapse.  

It's my only day to get this done, so I really hope my ""figuring"" pans out.  It'll be a long and tiring day, but a good one."

In other more personal updates, I'm feeling better.  Not completely better, but much better than I was.  Hopefully I can get some shit done today.  I have really supportive friends who rock.  :-D"

"event","I'm depressed.  Is it any shock?  I'm back at work today, and I <i>know</i> it's the best thing for me, but I'm just kinda dragging through in a haze.  It's not that I can't stop thinking about her, or any such claptrap... I'm just wishing I was somewhere else.  Maybe taking a nap.  Yes, sleep would be good.

Yesterday when I was at my dad's I took a few minutes to go into Debbie's room.  I just looked at a lot of her things and I put my head on her pillow and I tried to take her in.  I touched her little pink hoodie sweater, and it was so soft and the next thing I knew I was crushing it to my face and crying into the fleece.

I'm tired right now, and I can't focus."

And Dad is fixing up my car for my birthday, so I shall soon be mobile again!  Sweet <i>sweet</i> freedom!  To be able to go where I want when I want in a reasonable amount of time -- to not be a leech on my driving friends (including a very <i>very</i> patient Panda) -- oh, it will be heaven!

I can't quit grinning!  YAY!"

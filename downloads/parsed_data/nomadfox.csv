This might be of intrest if you've heard about the impending trainwreck of 'family radio', specifically the May 21 rapture.
Its important to note that even in the couple centuries before Emperor Constantine in 312 AD, christian cults were convinced that it was the end times (which would be a running theme, waxing and waning in intensity from then on). Predictions were common and violent matyrdom was openly encouraged. It meant instant paradise and virgins aplenty. Noone wanted to risk waiting in a grave for judgement day. 

But known predictions are:
-----
365 AD: Hilary of Poitiers, announced that the end would happen that year. It didn't.

375 to 400 AD: Saint Martin of Tours, said the end would happen sometime before 400 AD.

500 AD: An earlier Christian academic Sextus Julius Africanus had predicted Armageddon at about this year.

968 AD: An eclipse was interpreted as a prelude to the end of the world by the army of the German emperor Otto III.

992 AD: Good Friday coincided with the Feast of the Annunciation; this had long been believed to be the event that would bring forth the Antichrist, and thus the end-times events.

1000-JAN-1: Many Christians in Europe had predicted the end of the world on this date. Serious criticism of the Church followed. The Church reacted by exterminating some heretics. Agitation settled down quickly, as it later did in the year 2000.

<lj-cut text=""Long list is Long!"">
1033: Some believed this to be the 1000th anniversary of the death and resurrection of Jesus. His second coming was anticipated. Jesus' supposed date of execution is unknown, but was believed to be in the range of 27 to 33 CE.

1147: Gerard of Poehlde decided the world end was expected in 1306 CE.

1179: John of Toledo predicted the end of the world during 1186. This estimate was based on the alignment of many planets.

1205: Joachim of Fiore predicted in 1190 that the Antichrist was already in the world, and that King Richard of England would defeat him.

1284: Pope Innocent III computed this date by adding 666 years onto the date the Islam was founded.

1346 and later: The black plague spread across Europe, killing one third of the population. This was seen as the prelude to an immediate end of the world.

1524: Many astrologers predicted the imminent end of the world.

1533: Melchior Hoffman predicted that Jesus' return would happen a millennium and a half after the nominal date of his execution, in 1533.

1669: The Old Believers in Russia believed that the end of the world would occur in this year. 20 thousand burned themselves to death between 1669 and 1690 to protect themselves from the Antichrist.

1689: Benjamin Keach, a 17th century Baptist, predicted the end of the world for this year.

1736: British theologian and mathematician William Whitson predicted a great flood similar to Noah's for OCT-13 of this year.

1792: This was the date of the end of the world calculated by some believers in the Shaker movement.

1794: Charles Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, thought Doomsday would be in this year.

1830: Margaret McDonald, a Christian prophetess, predicted that Robert Owen would be the Antichrist. Owen helped found New Harmony, IN.

1832?: Joseph Smith (1805-1844) was the founder of the Church of Christ, predicted Jesus would return during 1890.

1843-MAR-21: William Miller, founder of the Millerite movement, predicted that Jesus would come on this date. A very large number of Christians accepted his prophecy.

1850: Ellen White, founder of the Seven Day Adventists movement, made many predictions of the timing of the end of the world. All failed.

1914 was one of the more important estimates of the start of the war of Armageddon by the Jehovah's Witnesses.

1915, 1918, 1920, 1925, 1941, 1975 and 1994, all predicted to be the return of Christ.

Also the year 2000, 2004, 2005 were all predicted/prophesied to be 'the end' when Christ returns.

"event","I didn't really fully understand the point of LeVay's satanism. If you're not in the know, its basically theatrical atheism or agnosticism.

That was untill I looked at a youtube channel for the westcoast chapter. Now all the comments on the videos themselves were disabled, but the shoutbox was left on. and it was filled with some of the most vile abusive vitirol, psycotic death threats and pure unadulterated hatred you can get on them innernets. Stuff that would have you calling the cops. And they were from people who refered to themselves as christians. All because some average looking people went on a video and said 'Hi! we're satanists!<3'
At that moment it all clicked. Satanism was a strawman, a scapegoat. A sort of black mirror held up to plesant conservative society to demonstrate just how evil and hypocritical they could be.
 
Its similar to anonymous dressing up as Xenu outside scientology orgs. There were leaked memos from certain orgs who belived anonymous was controled by the extraterrestrial marcabian confederacy. So they began acting even more crazy and self destructive. (perhaps they should have made a xenu-based religion?) Its the same old same old, If you set up a symbol that by itself does nothing but represents people's deepest fears, you can watch it drag out all that fear and loathing into the open and observe the very worst examples of humanity. 

I realise they also use it to 'debug' themselves of subconcious hangups so they say (well, thats LeVay's excuse). Perhapse in a generation or two, you'll start seeing similar parodies in Muslim society. Whatever, perhaps I'm wrong, mebbie it was all because LeVay looked like Ming the Merceless and thats freaking people out somehow. Remember all that trouble he caused in the 80's? Noone likes hot hail!"

"event","""Nobody Wins a Nuclear War"" But ""Success"" is Possible

""The Power of Decision"" may be the first (and perhaps the only) U.S. government film depicting the Cold War nightmare of a U.S.-Soviet nuclear conflict. The U.S. Air Force produced it during 1956-1957 at the request of the Strategic Air Command.  Unseen for years and made public for the first time by the National Security Archive, the film depicts the U.S. Air Force's implementation of war plan ""Quick Strike"" in response to a Soviet surprise attack against the United States and European and East Asian allies.  By the end of the film, after the Air Force launches a massive bomber-missile ""double-punch,"" millions of Americans, Russians, Europeans, and Japanese are dead.""

"event","As a member of the Poseidon Family, it will be natural for you to become enthusiastic about the incredible endeavors you'll be undertaking with us, and to want to tell others. But just a second there, my good man! Let's take a minute to consider what could happen if company information fell into the wrong hands, and whose hands those might be.

""Can I tell my wife?"" Well, let's say you do. You tell her not to tell anyone. Your bond is sacred. But a woman's idle tongue is the devil's plaything. No sooner do you leave for work the next day than she's on the phone telling her best friend Candy. Then Candy tell Gertie, Gertie tells Maxine, Maxine tells Lulu, and while Lulu is telling Doris, a Chinese agent posing as an American operator listens in, and the next thing she's on the line with the Forbidden City, singing like a treasonous canary. The following day you and your wife are bound in shackles and China is sitting at the controls of our entire arsenal.

""Can I tell my children?"" What father wouldn't want his kids to look up to him? Don't be that father. One day at school, Ivan Bullykov will get more than lunch money out of your kids. He'll have national secrets! And while they're parading him through Red Square as a national hero, your children will be working in forced labor camps, right next to you and your beautiful young wife, who's now wrinkled and homely since the communists have banned makeup because it express individuality.

""Can I tell my drinking buddies?"" Surely if there's somewhere safe a man can place his trust, it is with his other male friends. But how much do you really know about them? Are they friends... or *comrades*? Don't be too sure. Even the most transparent window can hide secrets when it's lined with Iron Curtains.

Always remember: you are a member of two families now. And you have obligations to both. But your obligation to the Poseidon Family is greater, because while your children may misbehave and your friends may change and your wife may nag and cheat on you, Poseidon Energy will always be paying for and protecting your way of life. Don't tell anybody anything about the projects conducted at Poseidon Energy. when pressed, tell them that your job is repetitive and not worth discussing, but the Company is nurturing and gives good benefits and is always looking for new talent."

"event","""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83"">Able Archer 83</a> was a ten-day NATO command post exercise starting on November 2, 1983 that spanned Western Europe, centred on SHAPE's Headquarters situated at Casteau, north of the Belgian city of Mons. Able Archer exercises simulated a period of conflict escalation, culminating in a coordinated nuclear release.[1] The 1983 exercise incorporated a new, unique format of coded communication, radio silences, participation by heads of state, and a simulated DEFCON 1 nuclear alert.

The realistic nature of the 1983 exercise, coupled with deteriorating relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the Soviet Politburo to believe that Able Archer 83 was a ruse of war, obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear first strike.[1][2][3][4] In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in East Germany and Poland on alert.[5][6] This relatively obscure incident is considered by many historians to be the closest the world has come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.[7] 

The threat of nuclear war abruptly ended with the conclusion of the Able Archer 83 exercise on November 11"""

I just took a look at my posting calendar and realized I've been posting every MWF without realizing it.. :P

Today, instead of studying, we went to the pool! :D Kevin and Stephen are burnt, but I created this towel fort behind my chair.. and so I'm just crispy.

Then I accidentally fell asleep in Jason's bed.. went to dinner, then the library to study. Hurried back to watch House.

And THE LINK!!!

I watched the first 5 seconds with puppy until I realized the sound wasn't working. I ran downstairs to The Link party thingie, where everyone was also confused about the sound. It was awesome watching with them. We laughed and joked about the audio for 15 minutes after it ended :P

Then we were going to watch The Last King of Scotland.. but yeah that didn't work out.

Now.. biooooooo."

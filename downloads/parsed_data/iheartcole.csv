"event","okay so way to long since the last update... but I'll give it a shot and see if I cant land on my feet when alls said and done.  
lets start with graduating.. that was fun... i have to do i again in december for my M.S. and skipped class to be there...that took a bit of the fun outa it.  
this summer I send most of my time finishing up my masters and studying for the CPA.  GOD I AM A LOSER!!!! 

THE FUN STUFF

Okay lets start with the whole drinking thing... yeah, I still do that a lot, not as much but hey thats life right??? I was chilling in my house and talking to the randum hot chick whos living with us for the summer and before i knew it i drank a whole bottle of grey goose meanwhile shes still onher first, mind you its about 7 pm at this point. I did the stupid thing in that I tried to stand up and was like WOW... IM TOTALLY DRUNK... I Dont think i should stand.  So basically I sat there for like the whole night and passed out bombed at 9:30.  This is a lesson for anyone reading to know that GOOD ALCOHOL GOES DOWN SMOOTH, BUT STILL GETS YOU EQUALLY DRUNK.  So now im drunk on a Sunday at 9 pm and randum hot chick losses basically all respect for me...
Dating a lot lately, some interesting most not; trying to figure out what I want in a ""Bittie"" <bet its forever since you heard that term.  Its kinda like I can find a girl whose smart in one subject, hot, smart but dull, or anoying; the in the middle girl still missing... maybe i need to suck it up and just date an accountant...NOOOOOO!!!! I refuse... I need an artsy girl i think cause business people are too predictable and anyone who knows me knows i be accounting like for a while but I NEED RANDUM FUN...

Music is fun had a bit of writters block and fact the two posted are the only two ive written in the last like 6 months and thats depressing.  However, I have a new guitarist and once school kicks up were gonna put together a four piece and play shows.  That should be fun and I hope everyone comes drunk so that we sound good. I have improved dramtically since the last time a lot of people saw me last as i have branched out from folk and started playing rock and punk... 

Thats about it nothing else is really new.. well there is, a lot and more interesting stuff, but im too tired from class to write it up so im gonna end it here. Night kids.

okay here it is...
It's done in a pulsing quarter notes for the verse and the chorus is rocked out as loud as you can.  Its played all majestic like and while its slow it doesnt drag. 
capo on 3
verse C E7 Am Suspended F7...I think its 2 0 0 2 1 0 
       C                     E7                     Am                   Sup F7
Adam looked the the heavenly skys and asked the lord Jesus why oh why
Did you take my life ....     from Me            Today when you took my little boy away
I found your strenth when when you took my wife and gave a son to me 
And I lived for you like you died for me so why did you make me cry today.
And Juses looked down from the heavenly sky Oh my son you dont know how much I cried
On the day you lost your wife i carried you and her child inside 
I cried on that day and this one too I cried for her but mostly you
She had to come it was her time my son and now i cannt wait to hug you son.
Adam looked to the sky once more and asked Lord Jesus in prayer one more
Chorus
May angels lift him up on heavenly wings 
May he hear a chior of angels sing 
Will you open gate and your arms to him
bring him home bring him home bring him home
Verse
Jesus called down from the heavenly sky oh my son what have you done 
And Adam called Jesus by name and cried my lord im so glad you came
as he grabed the knife and took his life he screamed from the pain
Jesus yelled out but it was to late the knife stuck deep and his flesh it ate
and he laughed a little laugh and he cried a dredful cry as he said to him self deep down inside
Chorus
May angels lift you up on heavenly wings
and may you hear a choir of Angles bring you home to me 
May they open the gates for thee
and bring you home bring you home bring you home 
verse finger picked no lyrics
chorus 
butinstead of the bring you homes
its 
you have somewhere else you have to be"

"event","okay so in my randum playing at home this lyrics hes got a blue towel on came out to make fun of my brother.  and it kinda turned into a wedding song about he and deb.  its corny sappy and a little predictable but i dont care, it was catchy and rather uplifting.  

Hes got a blue towel on 
hes got a blue towel on
hes got a blue towel on 
and hes got a smile on his face

Shes got a pink towel on
shes got a pink towel on 
shes got a pink towel on 
and shes got a smile on her face

HE puts on his black and white
with a feeling that seems too right
while she bats her eyes at a mirror in return
a little bit of blue something old something new 
its only a moment before they say i do.

Shes got her white dress on 
Shes got her white dress on 
shes got her white dress on 
and flowers in her hand.

The organ plays here comes the bride
her mother cries as his father sighs
how time flies by
hes got a smile on his face as she
marches down to the rings tied in lace.

The priest stands at the alter
they know its no faulter 
that this moment is graced by God's light
he takes a deep breath and together they say i do 

she got her hand in his
hes got his hands in hers
theyve found eachother 
and neither could ask for more"

"event","LONG TIME NO POST:
okay so to catch you up on places ive been; i his disney for thanksgiving with the fam was sick for a better part of it but I still had fun pissing off robby.  ive been a ""bad boy"" this semester and it was fun.  cryans (its a bar) is my new home away from home and also the largest drain on my wallet. I live in a house of the misfit toys, theres not a singal normal person that lives there including myself and drama is no uncommon thanks to the guys downstairs. 
Did well this semester as far as grades are concerned a 3.2 and completing my first full non double counting grad class.  I spent the better part of term studying and playing my guitar of which i recently bought a new one ( and i cannt wait for it to get here).  Its an electric solidbody washburn WI68 with the natural look duel humbs and 18:1 knobs.  
I had lunch today with Mike and jeff and i am having dinner with awad, bros, dawn, possibly harsely, beans/beth, kelly, and herby tom and then were going out to the bar.  An interesting prospect seeing how I can easly out drink everyone on that list except maybe mike after all he is prez of his frat.   Got most of my Christmas shopping done today all but big poppy.  
I miss phill and Amie as they have become my adopted parents, or childern im not really sure which.  I formally accepted a post in TAS: COE , fed tax at EY in times square and now im waiting on the signing bous when i start i will be making more money than everyone but papa cole.  I had resigned PKT and had to come back and now i even have a title which is anoying. 
IM A FULL GRAD STUDENT NOW no more of this non matriculating crap.  i elected to walk in may where ill walk with gold trim and 2 sets of ropes.
I sleep on a couch at home which im about 1.5 feet too tall for cause dont have a bed but Cole sleeps with me so its all okay.  RObbo and DEB are now at the serious level and i expect them to be engaged by the end of the summer and the only reason it will take that long is cause he has to save to buy a ring pick out a ring and then give it to her.  
im pretty sure thats all so MERRY CHRISTMAS and enjoy break.

"event","so i saw this girl who i can honestly say i havent thought of in about 9 months tonight.  and all the feelings i never knew i even had came back to me.  It was strange we were always like makeout friends sleep over pals but never nething more.  yet tonight when i saw her i found myself jelious of a guy of never met over a girl i have no claim to.  Strange how its not the making out that made me jelious but the randum knock on the door and the smile that came with it or the aim at 130 to talk about nothing or the snuggling and waking up holding her and yes even the socks.  strange how the stuff i always took for granted is that which i miss the most.  I had to leave a place where shes not even supposed to be because i knew i would make a fool of myself after three more beers telling her that i hhave these feelings and i understand she doesnt but i had to tell her.... i hate my life.... just once something to fall my way its been a while.

"event","its strange how college is perversion of life.  I worked this summer at the job that i will probably have for the next 15 year of my life.  While i found it new and exciting with differnt tasks around every corner i cannt help but miss the days when i worked for steve.  The hammer nails, mop, and broom and seeing my work account for more than a billion dollar paper transaction where the parties never meet only send email and have tele confrences.   Ohh well ill just have to stand and live with my salary to keep me warm at night.  
   I feel like i missed the summer in a way as i didnt get to do ne thing fun till the end and then it was packed inbetween all the start of school year running around so i never got to feel relaxed.  stragne isnt it...  Darren never called me back just a side. comment as i look at my past enteries... I find myself playing my guitar a lot wishing i had some one to give a little guidance and maybe teach me a few songs though i can say that my chops are starting to get good i can do pretty much whateve
i can now play whatever i want when i want but i can only play like three songs and two of them are my own. 
met a lot of cool people at the house these past few weeks though i find i cant talk and pick up freshman girls... I try and ahve a conversation with them and i find myself broad and basically at that point shooting to get laid so i say randum in approriate stuff just to laugh at their reasponces.  strange I have been thinking i needed a younger girl who will be more upbeat about life and now i find that  i cant stad them being giddy.  this has led to a bit of drinking though all in good fun and only once too far so its not a bad ratio.  I miss xavier where everyone was just three doors away.  Man we had a solid crew in 252.  That could be it my lack of biggs... our randum discussions on life and what the hell we should do.  As wierd as it sound a guy i only hung out with in the room never socailly is the one i miss the most.  
     Robby has a gf now and the are adorable together... I can see this one going for a bit and thats good for the kid i mean he needed to find someone and deb is a sweetheart.  My mother told me that she doesnt think ill get married till im 35...   Maybe i should just order a bride from russia. Or if only Swechie... 
read the newest harry potter... it was great and i want to know how it all ends... I miss the ey crew we had a shit load of fun being young wealthy and in NY but now the money is gone and im back in s.o.  wrote a song today differnt than what I normally write very very blues.  I wish i had someone to teach me to play just like three punk songs cause i know i could go and wild out...   I guess im in a bit of the doldrums but I think im gonna go out fot the school plays I miss performing (when it was practiced).  I miss my trumpet ive been playing taht a bit too.  I was thinking maybe once school ends of going out for a core.  IM a bit rusty but i can still hit an e above high c and with some practice i know ill be back at an A.  THough i dont really want to play in a corp i want in on a jazz band or maybe some ska.  I think that im missing a creative portion of my life... yes actually i do think thats it.  for the first time in my life im not in some kind of performance and lets face it i love being the center of attention.  I find myself singing more and more and im not that ashamed of my voice ne more.  I have an okay control over it.  Maybe im in the wrong proffesion.  But i do love being an accountant.  The problem solving the stupid bad jokes knowing that the work i do has a greater good.  I dont know i think its a big case of senioritious.   well this disertation is long enough  im out have a good one."

"event","This is the first song that i have writen in well forever...but it draws and what i have been feeling latley very up and down.  even though i have no reason i mean life is going well right now.  ne way here it is for you to completly dismiss.




Last Night I lost my way home;
home the place i come from, 
you know the place im never alone.
Last Night I lost myself;
you know the man i had become 
and the one you had come to love.
Last night i lost what i'd been searching for;
and so much more you stole my heart.
Last Night i Lost my way
Lost my way home

When i walk through that door
my heart cried out as it floor
reading the note saying you were gone.
Every time i look at that broken picture frame
the pain seems to come on like a storm

How are you gonna find your own way
how am i gonna last another day
how are you gonna learn to let go
and how am i gonna learn to say no

Last night i found my way back home
all on my own 
Last night i found i what i'd been searching for 
and so much more i found my heart agian 
i found it in the girl next door.
Last night i found myself 
you know the man i was
the one i ive been trying to become 
the one i finally am
Last night i found my way back home

and i dont care that your not there 
when i walk right through that door,
 cause i dont love you ne more
and i through away that broken picture frame
i discarded it away with the pain

How are you gonna find your own way
how was i gonna last gonna last another day
how are you gonna learn to let go
and i finally learned to say no

I found what ive been dreaming of the girl next door
I found the girl that haunts my mind
I found myself again in an old friend
I found i dont love you ne more
I dont need you to stand beside me
and Im not gonna lead you
you cant walk behind

so now your gone 
i found i found my love with the dawning of the sun.
Lips so scarlet a pierced toung cheeks gold with silver studs
I found that you werent my real love

sometimes the only way to learn 
is to trust the guidance of a white dove
and sometimes its better not to ask
and this time im not gonna ask you back"

"event","So this break has been awsome turned 21, katie got married, and i got two new guitars.  During this break jeff and Mike nicholas and i have decided that we now hate livejournal because too many people we know have it now, or atleast have our names.  This leads us to a highly interesting point of where one can go to post shit about everyone else and allow others you want to see to view it and those that you do not want to see it not.  This is a highly interesting venture since sometimes the people you wanna bitch about are those that normally see it... also what about those interesting times when you just wanna put up your not so religious weekend.  

Next, being back at school i have come to realize break was way too small i like did nothing but i think like one more week and i would be recovered as it is now my classes are way too hard and way to anoying to have started 18 credits are gonna piss me off.  Thanks to the fucking school being dumb i didnt get to register ontime and so i have the worste teachers ever.  

I want to drink keystone premium, why you may ask answer is cause i can and nobody does. ill add later 
class is out"

Now you may be like what are you tlaking about but i think because i activley try and pull in all accounting majors and almost form a click within ourselves it pulls people outa the woodwork and allows us to work as one.  Yes thats right it is all about my solid managerial skills...ne way had a really weird dream last night i bought alchol then i went to something i dont even know where i was going and was drinking in the parking lot when i saw todd and then todd started drinking and then mike smith came and joined and then mary showed up and we all just started laughing... i odnt know what it means but i dont enough enough to read nething into it.  there are randum open cans of pabst blue ribon i assume ganley was drinking it cause it is a very hick beer i just wish he would clean up after himslef cause im getting tired of doing it every weekend.

"event","ok so awsome weekend.  started out slow and only got better.  but ne way starting with sat cause well that was a good day.  hung out all day did nothing then i went to greenday and they blew me away.  then i went to the pkt party.  my date looked rather hot as a sexy goldie locks... on the way there i got a phone call from erica we chit chatted she talked to Jeannine and the we set loose plans to meet uplater. so ne way jeannine and i roll up to the party we see everyone we talk and mingle and then we start drinking... and we keep drinking c i think my biggest down fall was that i let other people amke my drinks cause i got sick true i did a lil weed but not enough to get the spins i got.  ne way eventually i meet with erica we make out whatever and then we pass out.  then yesterday i went home saw the fam and that was good came back did nothing till round 12 when erica called and she was like comeover and hang out we stayed up till god knows what hour just chilling out. then i go back to my room and we have the talk about what our relationship is and we come to and understanding that was there but was never said and then i went to bed and now im doing all sorts of hw till thursday at 230 when i am free of everything."

of the memories of climing trees 
and looking to the skys
holding hands an encouraging glance
this is a 12 year old first romance
its done b4 this day is through 
just like me and u

you scored my soul
you took my heart and ripped it appart
and then you took the only part that was yours from the start
first holding hands
then probing glands (touncle hockey)
1st base second base homerun

so much for the fun of years gone by
its learing about the birds and bees
when it was ok for boys to cry
no body dancing at the dance
young eyes locking by pure chance
they dont know what to do
just like me and you

chorus

break down 

chorus
outro:
so this is what once was pure
showing up with flowers to your door
holding hands on lovers lane 
this is no longer a game 
trix may be for kids but baby when im with you their for me too
(int the back round kinda repeating)
i know this wont fall apart
or rip out my heart
with you its perfect soft and pure 
dispite that icreadible lure i feel
toward you body wow your such a hottie
(the last two lines will be changed and i prob wont ever write this or play it but i have  a meeting now so ill catch you all on the flip side)"

So we went and the car ride in was more or less them making fun of me since i had no idea what it was about and me complaining that i should probably be drunk(which was true in the end.) Ne way we get to nyc like 2 hours early and so we get coffee after parking the car and chill out daina and Nicole have to be in there early so Lil ben and some chick thats nicoles friend and i waite in the amin consession area.  I got to play marvel vs capcom and i was doing well till some guy who actually new how to play came in and kicked my ass.  well the chick we were waiting for finally showed up and so we went inside.  im not going into detail but heres the thing the movie i thought was baddly directed lacked the vision that something that ""on edge"" with its topics should have and missed ne form of real plot altogether but the audience yelling shit at people was fucking funny. we get out and nicole was doing the lights and went drinking without me i was hurt.  so daina drove home and we listend to bad music. we get back i call some peeps to see what was going on and theres nothing so i went back to the room and watched randum shows till 4 am and then i went to sleep.

"event","I generally consider myself an easy going guy. I try and not cause many problems unless there is a need.  This weekend i was abandond by people i thought were my freinds and partners then blamed for by them for thier actions.  It started about a week ago when my guitarest quit our former band.  I was like thats chill you know we dont do much and when we do its generally thrown together last minute so i understand as a muscian you want to leave and pursue a more professional.  I gave him a pat on the back and said to stay intouch no biggie we were gonna cancle our last gig with the excuse of my mono case that was at the time very strong (im doing 10000000 times better).  My drummer aims me and say why are you in the band and i responded honestly and said at first it was cuase she had asked me to and now that our relationship has become what it will forever be (nothing) im in if cause you and darren want me be so i stay in for you guys.  She flips out at the bluntness of my andswer (mind you i have tried quiting the band twice and got told no but now that darren wants out my reasons for being around are now the problems of the band are all my fault.) im like its not a big deal you know its how life is people move on its over darrens out so now theres no more uneeded stress.  she keeps flipping out i tell her several times to chill out what differnce does it make i mean its over now.  Shes like what pressure i was like well we book gigs when were not ready or last minute and every thing is thrown together and its stressful thats one of the big reasons our giutarest left she starts flipping out about how that is and i respond we dont practice we live faraway during the school year and we just dont take it in a serious mannor to then throw stuff together is not worth it for stress reasons of school for it. Im like this chick needs to chill out and then it got to be outa control she wasnt even making sence ne more so i was like im going to bed gonight chill out it doesnt even matter now (ill admit towards the end when she was just bithcing at me to bitch i pushed a few buttons and agrued back to defend myslef but i was calm for a good 45 minutes b4 that even i can only take so much b4 i get pissed).  Im like whatever the world keeps going... a few days later like wendsday im talking to darren and hes like oh yeah were playing it im like were are hes like yeah im like what happend to you wuiting hes like well were gonna do the last show im like that s chill let me know when were gonna practice hes like yeah sure you know youre my buddy its the last one so im like ok chill.   
i went home this weekend and im chilling out at home and then at 130 am im like hey 
shes like hey and im like whats going on litterally and she responds darren and i are practicing tomarow, you could come i guess if you really want.  now im not one to be picky but she gets mad becasue self realization is not a strong point to her she like blaming others for other peoples mistakes because its easy for her to do it that way always shift blame things must come from once reason people dont change whatever not getting into cause if you know her well you know what im tlaking about.  c what really made me mad was that i was left out because she was mad at me regaurdless of my own opinion or that of darren the guy who left now i dont know what happend but shes changed this year shes finding herself thats fine but then somehow or anouther my being in a frat which never once was brought up in the conversations is now the reason im an asswhole and what really anoys me is that darren copied my profile and posted them in his. he saidthat it was all my fault and i could have changed things now im not wise but if no one tlls me when stuffis going on and im not welcome how do i change things. After i metioned how for a guy who wanted to move to a more prof band to act in that manner then he tried saying it was cause of the mono and it was my fault it was the lack of effort to then take me out after i wasnt the one to quit the band.  (Then i dont know what songs they played but their are many asongs that i came up with either the backround vocals or a line here or their and they still refferd to themselves as gone since new years.)  so since darren quit marry got mad at me they got together decided that my frat was the reason the band didnt work and im the asswhole.  I dont claim to be wise or smart but this is rediculas childish and unprofessional that was my bithcing out and yes i have said it to their faces but as we are a band and everything i s my fault i wanted to put out a public statment of what happend. people can reaspond and i honestly dont care if either come on and bitch but thats what happend"

"event","so heres the quick and the dirty of the evening.  Gone since New Years I think is broken up mar and i had an arguement and she refused to talk to me as a logicail being so i went to bed.  well i watched a movie chasing liberty my mom rented it so i was like whatever and it wasnt that bad in fact i would say it was half way decent maybe i was just in the mood. who knows ne way i think i got something from my talk with mar cause i realized how much i didnt need her ne more instead of like how i used to be following her every where and i think that through her off i mean it was our first real fight since new years and like it seemed to fit i said, what, about half of what needed to be said and i think that very well could be the end of it...and thats good i think mar neds to move on shes still caught in high school or finally breaking free of it or something in her past ne way if only she could finally let down her gaurd fully it has started to fall but she never lets go all the way... ne way it was the most peaceful night after that that i have had in a long time it feels like this huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  Hell i even wrote a song not about drunkenness or regret.  IT was amazing.  but ne way... here are the lyrics its about the night night of drunnken lodging i had this past weekend and kinda like the evening itself a lot was implied but nothing happens. dont have a title please submit one im very open to sugestions

I feel you breath in and out against the world
the smell of your hair the touch of your skin 
I cannt wait for our moment of eternity to begin
the sun hits your neck my mouth graces it to feel the warmth
your heart beats with mine as our bodies intertwine

I pull oyu close
and breath you in 
the pleasure of your warmth is my only sin
our eyes lock you bite your lip as you smile (i may add, and look away, not sure)
my heart skips a beat and i know this is it

NO more holding back
sunlight cascades through the slits in my window shade
your touch is just as soft
I push as you pull 
we close our eyes
and this moment is perfect

we keep our eyes close pretend to be asleep
just to make the moment last a little longer
But its gone like the sun only the memory
of its warmth remains
you get out of bed 
a hug is your goodbye
there are no tears here to cry

Heres the chorus i think

The look of your face
your warm embrace
so this is perfect
the touch of your skin
the smell of you hair
so this is was love is
The taste of your toung 
the sound of your voice
and this moment is perfect (the last one is was perfect but you get the point)"

"event","So yeah the new underoath and used cds sooo good its like music sex(such a fan of that saying)  dont know why im putting in a journal entry since im in the middle of class but i am ne way.  one thing is that i had the greatest entry ever and no one resoponded, * bitting my Thumb at you*  Oohhh so emily aparently had a convo with one of her sisters about me thats sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo solid.  she had me all confused at first cause shes like i hear you met my sister this weekend and im like i dont rember meeitng ne one so i was like huh she like emily and she starts describing her im like ohh i already know her but we only had like one conversation and she was like ohh you already knew her and then there was a wierd silence but still emilly is like tlaking to friends about me which is like the highlight of the past month.  Hung out tati last night that was interesting cause she was like lets get drunk and so we start drinking she had like one and there was the wierd non sexual tention and i cannt say why which is weird but i think its because i had been drinking and so im normally hang out in the conner but when its only like two people its hard to be quiet so i felt the need to speek and no i should never ever talk.  My pledge bros know why.  God just thinking about the times when i spoke makes me shutter.   NE way im in such a weird point in my life cuase i have soooo much work and such little insperation. Found an awsome site well it was sent to me its called bloodninja look it up or aim me about it.  Also i have decieded that yeah women and alcohol are what have caused this major speed bump.  why i dont know but still i blame them in every aspect and dont say its not fair cause im not saying it is.  finally got the contract today for the record deal have to sit down with bill and a few other people to read through it to see what need s to be changed.  and since it wasnt written by a lawyer i think i may be able to rip the shit outa it.  Y cause that what i like to do and so i think i may wanna finish my accouting degree and go to law school how hot would it be to be doc cole at 25??? shit the money i would make.   I mean wowowowowowowowowow.   Im sucha losser.  i know.  ne way FUCKING DELOITTE.  Now im Rambloing to take up space.  OHHH I just took a piss in your laundry hamper.

so by like 6 i was already well buzzed and then by the time i met up wit rob i had sobbered up so we went to see benny d and i got written up for drinking in the room when i wasnt drinking there the some random letter chick how was hot came in and like yelled at cream and i was like wow shes cute and talked to her because of it.  then we went to my room and drank to forget.  then we headed to ZBT to see ryan (my boy whos also an accountign major) we got in for free as it was his house we had a beer together and went over to ABT I think thats the letters i mean no disrespect.  then we went back rob headed home after a game of techmo and i got a call from scott and nat around 1230 so we went to Kellys bday bash where i did jello shots and hung out till 4.  went to bed woke up at 11 went to lunch showered and nat and i started drinking and watched airplane and then went back to my room after watching the movie and my roomates were drinking so i kept drinking and then i finished the handle of vodka apparently i made out with some chick went back to nats room watched some more of the game then i came back and tried playing wingman for ganley and he is imposible he has no game came back drank and went to bed.    woke up saterday tried to peice fridaynight together swore i wasnt gonna drink and then i went to see bida cuase he hurt himself i ment three awsome chicks and then the absenth came out and you cannt turn it down cuase how often do oyu get the opertunity to have it.  and then it turned out that lugashi was celabrting his 20th bday.  sso we went thier drank kettle one and it was sooooooo good my favorite.  i was tripping it was awsome talkjed to like all these girls cause there were like 20 of them and and 8 brothers.  walked home slept woke up still tripping today and then slept all day today and that was it."

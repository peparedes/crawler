"event","<lj-cut text=""ramblings. ramblerambleramble"">i had my first revelatory introspective discovery in years tonight. i'll break this down for the two of you that may or may not even see this. this week i received a friend request from one elizabeth jane jackson, liz to some, jane to 50% of people who'll read this. anyway, this was the girl for whom my first band was named, and receiving that request took me back to that summer when we met and, i'll be honest, i totally fell in love with her, and the events of the following summer that took her out of my life forever basically. thinking about this while driving home from first fridays tonight, an event i attended regularly with a different former lover, took me on an unexpected detour.

listening to kid a, which i haven't listened to in ages, i decided i was going to creepily drive by the houses of my girlfriends of yesteryear. naturally i decided to do this chronologically, starting with deena gunnell, proceeding to ali hansen, and ending with elizabeth koebele. as i drove past each house, each long since vacated by those that made those drives worth it, old emtions i really haven't felt in years really swelled over me. the pain of the breakups having long since vanished, all that i remembered were the positive feelings and good memories i had in these edifices that once housed individuals that in one way or another changed me and my life.

that's neat, right? this kind of experience typically should have brought nice, warm fuzzies that ended in a melancholy and longing for my past of impossible happiness that somehow existed in some fold in the fabric of space/time. but not this time.

of late, when ever i feel particularly introspective, i rarely come across any thought i haven't thought before. which, obviously, for an introvert has an excruciating harshness that would drive a man insane. but tonight, for the first time in years, i thought of something different, a stream of consciousness that took me some place i never knew existed in this underworked mind.

i realized these emotions i was feeling for these former lovers were that i loved them and they loved me..in spite of myself. this was something i feel was rare growing up, or maybe was just too impersonal for me to feel like it was real. anyway, the point is they were able to give me something that was unlike anything i could get anywhere else, and liz jackson was the first that i had ever received that from. she was also the first female in my life that my parents went to lengths to keep away from me..and were extremely successful in that venture.

there's a whole backstory i'm not going to go into, but the bottom line is this, she lived in utah and only visited during the summer, and my parents made sure she stayed in utah for the summer...forever. i hated them for that. for keeping me away from a happiness i never felt around them from a love that i never received from them. it seemed to me to be this destructive mentality, ""since we can't be the ones to give that to you, we'll be the ones to make sure you never have that in your life."" and that seemed the cycle whenever i dated anyone after that. they would do their best to try and be disruptive to that relationship as they could..and i would do my best to not let them...but it always was a source of serious contention that my significant other couldn't really feel like they were welcome in my home and ultimately led to the eventual termination of all three major relationships.

anyway, as i pulled into my driveway at the conclusion of idioteque, i realized this is why i now lack the ability to find or date anyone..my parents are now pushing me to do it. it's no longer an act against them and it just can never hold for me what it used to...</lj-cut>"

"event","i just realized tonight, after yet another viewing of frost/nixon(which should have won best picture 2008) why the film slumdog millionaire has no relevence in life(mine anyway) and didn't deserve the the academy awards it received. those of course being best picture and best screenplay.

i don't believe in karma. i believe someone who is intrinsically good can be shat on their whole life and never tip some cosmic scale that will suddenly rain down good fortune. i also feel the opposite to be true, that someone innately evil can be smiled on by the fates and have the world handed to them on a platter with no negative, reprecussive explosion waiting around the next turn. i feel to think otherwise is absurd.

i believe in cause and effect. that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. i believe that even if you do paint God into the picture that he will still be bound by the same governing universal laws, he also will be bound by cause and effect. what's going to stop a random stranger from clubbing me over the head tomorrow, kidnapping me, and slowly torturing me until i drip my last drop of blood, aside from his own personal decision not to do so? it's not like God is going to physically stop him because, ""oh, he just got done recovering from 2 different accidents. oh, his love life is completely worthless and nonexistent right now. oh, his job sucks. oh, his living situation is nearly uninhabitable. i've screwed with his life enough. let's not let gaear grimsrud screw him over today. short circuit his wood chipper too while you're at it."" (i'm trying not to interject personal religious beliefs on this issue)

i suppose my point is that slumdog is too capricious a story based too heavily on the childlike belief that because because jamal malik had been shat on his whole life that he would haply be put in the exact circumstance that he would need to be in to become a millionaire and live happily ever after with the girl of his dreams because life is always fair. it's too fantastical a fairy tale to be taken as seriously as the world has taken it. i was waiting for him and latika to fly off into the sunset on falcor as they rolled credits.

i don't know what i'm saying any more...i'm tired. i just know that this is quite possibly the most critically overrated film of all time. 

end of line."

"event","well here it finally goes in some sort of fashion. tonight was the first night in a very long time that i actually felt like writing my own music, instead of just writing parts to someone else's music. it is a feeling i haven't felt, at least to this degree in i'd say over 5 years. i think what it comes down to is the fact that i haven't felt like i've adequate...well inspiration for lack of a better word. i mean my love life has dragged me through one of the shittiest holes i've ever been through in my life as of late...but to me love is something too numinous to tarnish by trying to put word and verse to properly. however i knew that with where i had been lately, i wouldn't even try to write something not pertaining to this subject...but i suppose the events of friday night pretty much diverted my attention from the forlorn state i so readily and consistently found myself in...

friday night i lost a very big chunk of the fingertip of my left middle finger...a finger very necessary for guitar playing...i don't know if i will be able to play the anymore...

anyway, thanks to everyone of you that came to the show saturday night even though it was rainy out. you are all my hardest. i felt the love. drew danburry was a tech right? i think he might have been a bit faded......i need a roadie/tech

visited a little emo boy with a compound fracture today. he was all drugged out and playing with the pins in his leg, he is just the cutest thing ever. i forgot how much i dislike hospitals....

if you feel like being a tech, come visit me at work tomorrow from 1 - 4:30. i'm sure i'll be out of it, with my 5 hours of sleep in the last two days. just be hard laterlater.

i feel very cryptic as of late. i want every single person who reads this to ask me something about my life to illuminate my past, clarify my present, or elucidate my future and i will do my best to satisfy your inquiry through means i find necessary and proper.

and you happen to be reading this and start to think,""my goodness, i haven't hung out with this kid since the last time he updated his journal"", then we need to hang very soon. call me up already. i'm usually a bored person, i usually have to entertain myself.....ohhh crusty.

i ran out of stuff to write. my mental processes are fried...i'm not going to be able to finish those cards afterall....

be hard.

"event","so i just finished making my personality scrapbook for psychology. as i was going through all the personality assessments, i was shocked to find out so much about myself that when i actually thought about it, it was really true. it also made me realize how much i owe people for helping me become who i am. even if at times i am discontent with myself, because of certain people, i am much more happy much more often.

thank you.

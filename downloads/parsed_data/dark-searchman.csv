"event","After returning home from <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/vanishing_court/12198.html"">seeing female Moslov and her puppies</a>, Dark Searchman made his way to his room and sat down stiffly on the bed, wincing slightly. He leaned down to rub his leg, expression grim. He hadn't told anyone, not even Laika, about his visit to one of RV's doctors. And what the doctor had found didn't surprise him as much as it should have.

The limp was permanent. Thankfully, the stiffness and pain would fade eventually. And the more often he ended up in his dog form, the more ""organic"" he became. Currently he was half-way to the level of crossfusion, and hopefully he wouldn't pass that level. He could still enter the net, but it took longer.

And that wasn't even taking his Dark Aura into account. It was...diminished. It was still there, just...not as intense. He could think clearly, and the aggression and...sadism...wasn't as strong. He wasn't returning to normal- that would never happen with what he'd done.

But still...his diminished Dark Aura worried him more than anything else. It would never vanish or completely fade away. It had to be going somewhere. But <i>where</i>?"

"event","Dark Searchman was curled up in a hole under a tree between Pride and her Laika's townhouses, having discovered it was cooler than the crawlspace. And he was <i>not</i> happy. That encounter with the new Moslov still rankled, and he was growling softly to himself. He just knew that his Laika would attempt to bring her home, and then he'd have to defend himself from <i>two</i> Moslovs. As if one wasn't bad enough!"

"event","After escaping the enclosure, Dark Searchman made absolutely sure Moslov wasn't around before he started exploring the area and getting used to this form. It was novel moving around on four legs, rather than two. And the scents... Those were extremely distracting. Not to mention the squirrels scolding from branches."

"event","Dark Searchman laid in the center of the enclosure with his head on his paws, giving a canine scowl. He was still LOLed and extremely annoyed. He'd explored every inch of the pen and had been unable to find a way out, nor how to get the chain off without opposable thumbs. And adding to the indignity was the dog food he'd been given. He'd responded by throwing it out, and Moslov had been happy to have the extra food he could reach.

That was another thing. Moslov was currently prowling around outside the enclosure, growling at Dark Searchman. The former navi had learned real fast not to lay near the sides of the enclosure- Moslov had charged and almost managed to reach Dark Searchman through the wire. Dark Searchman had solved that problem by laying in the center of the pen and ignoring Moslov's growls and the growls of his own stomach."

"event","Dark Searchman smirked as he shoved Laika into the secluded house he'd ""aquired"" in Seaside, locking the door and the iron gate on the door. The house was small, but well-furnished, with iron bars over all the windows and iron gates on the front and back doors. All in all, it was a glorified cage.

""Welcome to your new home. I hope you enjoy it."""

"event","well today wasnt all that great... i ended up going to zila's house yesterday though-that was fun, until i found out sumtin.
i never knew juan smoked!!! but even though i dont like him smoking, i still like him. i donno i guess i just dont want him to smoke around me. but yeah i went down to the skool today. this morning.
um me zila and alyssa helped ms mo throw away lit. books! yeah i always wanted to do that to a text book.
um i got 2 hugs from adrian, i was gonna ask christian and juan for one, but i didnt. when i asked juan wat he wanted to tell me yesterday he said if i wanted to hook up with mario. then i told him no that i didnt cuz i didnt like him like that. he then looked at rafael and gave him this smile and winked i think... but he gave him a look that seemed to say that good thing or sumtin..i dont noe im confused. he says he wants to hook up with me (i asked him online and he said that wat he told my sister was tru) but then hes telling me to hook up with mario. i donno."

I rode my first rollorcoaster ever! my first rollercoaster was Superman.... theni went on Demon 3 times cuz of joey and dion, i swear dion and jeremy were stalking me and alyssa! SCARY!!!!i was gonna go on Batman, but i chikened out. i really wanted to go on Dejavu, but yup u guessed it!- scared.
i went on the water ride 3 times and got soaked, i mean really soaked!
it was fun though!

"event","i swear all guys think alike.

Its kinda creepy cuz i think 2 guyz that i noe have the <B>SaMe</b> exact brain!!!

Yesterday i went shopping for my graduation dress. I went to kohls cuz i had seen it online already. But when i got there it wasnt there. I tried on different ones but i didnt really liked them. So then we went to JCPenny and what do u noe the drees i was looking for at kohls was there. 

I went to go try it on and i thought it was nice. So ofcourse i bought it. But then as soon as i bought it i didnt like it. I told my mom if it didnt look like a dress for an older person. She said it was fone but hey shes a mom. So then i went to go look for some more dresses but the ones i liked my mom didnt. And she had her sis there so they both agreed on the same things. 

My mom found this dress <b>She liked</b>. She told me to try it on and she liked it but i really didnt i liked another one that i had tried on. But she was pushing me into buying it. So i was like fuck it! I bought the dress she liked.

No ones gonna see it i thought so whats the point i really dont like dresses ne wayz. So when we got home she was telling all of my family members how i didnt like ne thing and all this otehr stuff... I wen tot go try on my aunts dresses which were new still with tags on and i liked one alot. So thats the one im wearing and since my mom liked the other one soo much ...well... she can keep it.

Man i just had to let that out..lol.. Today is Memorial Day!!! Later opn im going to my aunts house cuz my grandma went over there last night. I think most likely we will make some food!! Alyssa i eat when im bored      (inside joke).

Tomorrow is six flags!!!!!! i hope it doesnt rain. But tomorrow is gonna be soo much fun. Especially since im gonna be with my gurlies.

Ok mike, juan, and rafa have nick names they are:  Lj, Bj, AB
Me, Alyssa, and Mija also have nicknames they are: Mg, Rb, Jm

only we guyz and gurlz noe what they sstand for. But ppl can try and guess.
Well i g2g clean ill update later.

Ms. McCmillen made the gurlz bathrooms overflow. So then the gurls cant go to the washroom for the remainder of the year.

HAHA.. today was the 8th graders last day.

After school angie and jackie were gonna fight jessica delgado and sandra. But they didnt... somehow sandras and jessicas parents came... and all they did was talk.. well actually yelling and cuzzing at each other. The maris mom  came and stoped it.

"event","Sepia was positively &lt;i>fuming!&lt;/i> Who did Sei think he &lt;i>was?&lt;/i> Taking her things and messing up her perspective and being so damn cocky about it all--her fingers itched to give him a good throttling.

Arden's room (who was Arden anyway and why was Sei in his room?), where was it... A quick question (demand?) to a passing collegue and Sepia was on her way, scowling and ready to beat the living daylights out of that boy."

So prosaic and awkward and all
D'you think you've got me down?
D'you think I've never been out of this town?

Do I seem too eager to please to you now?
You don't know me at all
I can't turn it on, turn it off like you now
I'm not like you now

Now you're here
I bet you're wishing you could disappear
I'm trying to be kind
I get the feeling you're just killing time

You look down on me
Don't you look down on me now
You don't know me at all
A slap in the face
In the face for you now
Just might do now

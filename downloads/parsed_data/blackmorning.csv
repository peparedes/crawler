"event","I just had the hottest dream.

Walked in to get a tattoo, a tattoo designed on intuition alone. I felt sexy, slinky, smooth and soft. He looked me up and down, and could sense my excitement. His eyes glowed with excitement and recognition and he moved closer

""I have an idea, come with me to the back room""

I followed, and took my clothes off down to just the basics. I stood there, exposed and excited while his eyes went up and down over my body. He reached out, touched his fingertips to the small of my back, the curve of my hips. His eyes met mine and he leaned in closer. Feeling his breath close and hot on my cheek, he whispered in my ear ""yes, that's what I want to do... sit down""

I sat on the table, aching, while he prepared his tools. He knew how much he was teasing, and he smirked while he set up. He slid over smoothly, and placed his hands on my ribs, giving me a gentle nudge to lay down on my side. I obeyed. He helped me take the rest of my clothes off and once again he stood for a moment, admiring.

Then came the pen.

""I must draw it straight on you, while the inspiration is hitting me"" He could see just how excited I was getting, and he reveled in it while he started drawing.

The pen ran up my thigh, over my hip, and into the small of my back again and again. The feeling was soft, then sharp, then long and smooth once more. I turned over as he continued the design onto my back, my belly, my other side. Each line of the design let him trace my body with his gaze, and I could no longer keep my composure.

I shut my eyes, in hopes that I could control myself, but that only made him change the stroke of the pen - more stimulation, closer and closer he brought his face to my skin. Soon each line he drew was punctuated by a kiss on my skin. I had to open my eyes, to see, and when I did I saw his smile again and met his eyes. I was to enjoy this, and watch him enjoying it also - I obeyed.

""Now, my love... the ink."" He moved forward and kissed me full upon the lips. It was passionate, and my whole body tingled before he pulled away and left the room. It seemed like hours before returned, tattoo gun in hand, to sit in the chair and start mixing inks.

""Go look at the design, see if you like it"" he said, and I stood to look in the full length mirror at my decorated body. Beautiful swirls of waves crashing into the rocky beach, tiger lilies opening up to the sun and water on my thighs - each line, each flower sitting perfectly to accent my body.

He came up behind me, putting his hands on my hips and kissing at my neck, ""The best is on the back"" he said, turning me around to face him. ""Look""

I turned my head back towards the mirror to see a lotus flower, perched right in the nook of the small of my back. The lines of the waves turned upwards into leaves framing the lotus, following the natural curve into my waist. ""It's beautiful, Chris, it's beautiful."" I said, turning back to him. I wanted so badly to kiss him once more, but his hands were firm on my hips as he pushed me away slightly.

""Then we begin."" I layed back down on the table, and he started outlining his drawing. The sting of the gun was sharper at first than I remembered, and my hands gripped the table to cope with it. He started with the bands around my thighs, then worked the lotus on my back, the design on my belly, the lilies, the color. As the sharpness of the gun faded, the pain was softer, more exquisite. It was all I could do to contain my lust.

It was almost done, I knew, and with each passing moment he'd been moving closer. I could feel his breath again, against my collarbone, and I closed my eyes again in ecstacy. The tattoo gun stopped, and instead his gloved hand ran up my thigh, gripping me at the hips, and I heard his breath hesitate before he kissed me again. I could no longer control myself.

I moaned, wrapping my arms around him and gripping my fingers into his hair to pull him closer. I felt his body react, felt him move, and before I knew it, he was as naked as I, excited as I, and his arms wrapped around me again. He slid me gently off the table, held me strongly so I needn't move, and slid me onto him. Immediately my aching ceased and switched to hot and passionate lust.

His hands once more gripped my hips, trying to direct me, but I shook them off and gripped his head tighter as I pulled his head back to whisper in his ear, ""My turn now"" as I moved down to kiss and bite at his neck. With each bite I feigned, he gasped slightly, but with excitement at the teasing. I slid myself up and down him, and his head tilted back against his chair with a moan. ""More"" he panted, ""more""

We became more empassioned, moving with each other faster, harder. His head leaned forward, his eyes once more taking me all in, then meeting my eyes with a wink. ""I'm not done with you yet...""

He reached over, changed his glove, and once more picked up the tattoo gun, dipping it into the blue ink of the sea. I had to make my movements smoother, gliding up and down while he tattooed. I could tell he was concentrating, but the movements of my hips brought the lines of the waves to life. The subtle ripples, the long curving movement of the ocean meeting the beach, was all a part of our ecstasy. As each line was finished, I could feel him harden all the more.

The tattooing, the sex, all of it was one. The sting of the gun was gone completely now, and left in its wake just aching. I knew as each line was finished we came closer to finishing together. My excitement built, and my head leaned back. My moans grew louder, each movement more defined. His other hand fell to my hip, pulling me down on him harder. As I felt him finish the last line, I heard the clunk of the tattoo gun on his tray, and his tattooing hand return to my hip.

The last few thrust were sheer bliss as the two of us came together, writhing and moaning, his hands tight on my hips. I felt him come inside me, and felt the release of all that energy, and I fell against him gently, leaning my head onto his shoulder. ""My gods... that was..."" I started.

""Shhhhh..."" as a finger met my lips. ""Come see how beautiful it is..."" We separated and I stood up, led over to the mirror, where I could see the tattoo and our naked bodies together. The image was perfect. The stark colored beauty of the tattoo mirrored the passion of what had just happened. The lilies exploded in color where his hands had gripped my hips and slid down my thighs. The red on my belly accented the muscles I had used to move me. He turned me around once more and we leaned in for one last kiss before leaving.

I didn't need to look, I knew exactly where the lotus sat - where I had felt the both of us come together, felt the explosion of lust before the calm and soothing glow of meditative bliss.

The kiss was perfect. The tattoo was perfect. He helped me bandage it as he helped me dress. With one more kiss, I departed, off to go savor the memory had with each viewing of those waves..."

and now lie wilted
music echoes through, a delicate piece
intended for those angelic voices that come along
once in a lifetime

he was singing to me that night,
a lullaby.
gentle, soft, angelic,
not understanding the peace it brought
he was just trying to soften an evening of stress
a lullaby to soothe the soul
and a walk, hand-in-hand, to my cabin

i remember.
i remember everything about you,
the way the afternoon sun caught your eyes,
the gleam of armor, and seeing you for the first time as a soldier
feeling your protective wings spread over me
the one time you ever saw my tears fall

the night of the lullaby, a night of love unconditional
a night of love without expectations,

i oft write of passion, and lust,
and at times of deep held love.
and mayhaps not often enough of the tender moments of life
of love held not within lovers.

of the love held between the brothers and sisters to our spirit
love that will not fade, that will not turn its face to danger
love that never once has forgotten the good times through the bad.

a lover's love is wonderful, magnificent, passionate,
and yes...
i miss it greatly, milord...
and you always shall be milord...

and at the same time... such tempered love can be present in a life,
i am grateful it has entered mine.

i sit tonight and remember, for you, my brother.
i remember your eyes, the sound of a knowing sigh when my tears fell
and the sound of your voice,

angelic

rising into the starred sky.
a lullaby.

milord, do you see now? why i fell asleep so soon after <i>you</i> sang? 
why it calmed me to the core? you showed me tempered, even, lasting love.

tonight, i raise my glass. i remember the both of you tonight.
i remember my brother, and i remember milord,
and tonight, i miss you both with such a sting

like a match to the heart."

"event","crying one, look and see what you almost did.
look around you and see. he's not gone. he's right where he said he'd be. do not fall at his feet in tears... those are exactly the pits you're staying out of.

you had a hard day, crying one, little one,

you were terrified, you had flashbacks, you were trying to help yourself... and when the nurse held you, you called for him
you didn't know he wasn't there. i didn't tell you. because i was there. i thought it would all be ok. and it wasn't, and i'm sorry. i've been here all day trying to help you

yes, you wanted more than anything to have arms wrapped around you when you got home - but you refused to see my own open arms, looking only for the arms of a few. yes, you wanted to let go, to cry, to mourn for the memories that were stirred and those that were created today. i was right here. i gave you texas toast. i gave you cold, fresh water. i gave you geek movies. Druid watched over to make sure the two of us were ok, and yet still you hid.

you showed your face for a minute, to admit to what happened to the two of them... and then ran and hid under the arms of someone 3000 miles away - you tried to pull him into your hiding with you.

now, little one,

cut the shit.
i know you're sad. i know you miss him. so do i. i've seen the pits, you dragged me into them, through them - and you tried to drag him through, too...

but they're like quicksand, those pits. you have to swim out on your own. pulling on anyone only gets you deeper.

cut the shit.

yes, cry. cry, mourn, howl... do what you need to do. but don't think for a second you are going through it alone. i am right here.

no more pity party, little one. you have everything you need right within you. you do not need anything beyond yourself. for you are me, and i am you. i am always here. my arms hold the same love and warmth for you as they ever did for him.

little one, he's not gone... he's standing in his world. you'll need to stand up in yours to be able to see him.

i'm standing, stand next to me. come on... stop pulling on my leg. stand up with me. if you don't stand up... that's your own choice. but i'm standing, hear me? i'm not losing sight. i'll hold you when you cry, but i'm not sitting back down again. ever.

i'm standing.
i have a sobbing child at my feet, a sobbing teenager, too.
sometimes it's awfully tempting to lay down there with them and cry...... and sometimes i do. but never again will i live there with them. it's an old world down there, it's a sad world down there, where nothing makes sense.

i laid there for months, thinking my support would raise them up. i gave myself to their tears, and it did not work. it only made me forget what there was to stand up for.

so, let them cry. at this point, that's all they know how to do.
i'm standing. i like the view.
i'm not sitting down there again."

touching me, and i lose all control.

i could watch you for hours...
the teasing, tempting, tensing building up
until i just can no longer wait.</lj-cut>
<br> warming up, warming up...
<lj-cut text=""want"">
Want

i want you and cannot have you...
you're next to me and miles away
i can smell you, feel you, hear you,
and my mind races thinking about all the possibilities.
remembering back to times passed
times of passion, intense and burning
being chained on my knees on the floor
groveling in front of my lord, begging to be granted the right
to bring him pleasure.
remembering teasing him with ladylike ways
so i could be ravaged and treated in unladylike ways

you're right next to me and miles away
nothing i can do but lay here and want. </lj-cut>
<br> better...
hmmm... a story next mayhaps? i think so... more later.

"event","I am standing before you, naked, trembling, my back covered in raised red welts. You are smiling, a wry smirk, indicating that I am finally going to receive my reward for everything I have done. It's been quite a night for the two of us.

You came home from work, tired, frustrated. I greeted you at the top of the stairs, happily awaiting your return. Your scowl changed into a mischievous smirk. Tossing your bag and coffee mug to the floor, you pushed me against the wall, and began kissing me - hard, deep, passionate. Feeling my skin tingling, I grabbed onto you, pulling you in tight, running my fingers through your hair.

""On your knees in front of me. Now."" You demanded.

I smiled softly, blushing a bit. ""What? But... someone could come home...""

""Now."" you didn't look amused. I obeyed and got on my knees in front of you, looking to you expectantly for my next order.

""Strip. Stay kneeling. I want to see your body.""

Shyly, slowly, I removed my shirt, and inched the shorts off my bottom. I looked up to you, and you gave another less than amused look. ""All of it, now, or you get nothing from your Lord.""

""Yes, milord,"" I began, removing my bra and panties, leaving them in a pile aside me. ""What now, milord?""

""I never get to see you get yourself off, and this needs to be changed. Give me a show, here in the hallway. You *will not* stop until you are finished, no matter what happens.""

I know that people will be home from work soon, so I decide that I must finish quickly. I reach down and begin touching myself, on my knees in front of you. You crossed your arms, leaning against the wall, removing your boots and enjoying the show.

I can feel the power building inside of me, I'm getting closer and closer, my breath quickens. I look to you and you are smiling, and I close my eyes and let go. I'm ready to cum when I hear the latch thrown at the bottom of the stairs.

""C is home... you better hurry or he's going to see you fucking yourself, dripping all over the carpet...""

I panic and stop for a second.

""Don't you fucking stop. You'll get nothing for a week, and I'll make you watch me jerk off into my hand. You'll get nothing... you better finish faster""

I go at it full bore, knowing you will keep your word, ignoring the sounds from downstairs, to get myself to cum faster. I am being quiet, knowing that in a minute he will be at the top of the stairs. My open mouth, a long exhalation, and my pussy dripping onto the rug are the only indications you have that I've cum, hard, in front of you.

""Good girl. Into the bedroom now. If he sees you, I'll make you watch me jerk off for a month.""

I scramble, grabbing the pile of clothes and run into your room. You poke your head around the corner.

""Don't let him see you, not even an inch of you. You're mine. But don't you dare close this door, understand?""

I nod, wondering where I am to go, to hide, and hearing his footsteps at the top of the stairs. I open the closet door and curl up on one of the boxes, pulling it closed behind me.

I wait, for what seems like an eternity in that dark, small space, smelling my pussy, trying to keep from dripping all over your comics and your clothes. You are taking your time, breaking your slave minute by minute.

I hear your voice outside the door, talking to C. You are having a conversation, and I am waiting for you, trembling, dripping, touching myself... wondering what else you have in store for me.

He leaves, and I see the door open, my eyes slam shut because of the rush of light.

""Good girl. You may come out now.""

I uncurl and step out of the closet. You grab me by my hair and kiss me again, your hand roving up my thigh, and your fingers slamming into my pussy. I can only gasp, pant, and continue kissing you. You push me backwards onto the bed, and you stand near the edge, fucking me hard and fast with your hand. I'm starting to get noisy, panting, moaning... oh, the treat of my Lord within me...

You pull your hand out, clamping it down over my mouth.

""You're going to let the whole world know what I'm doing to you!"" The anger is present in your voice. ""Just for that, you get nothing."" You turn and walk away from me.

""No, no, please, milord... I'm sorry..."" I'm crawling to you on my hands and knees ""What can I do, milord, to please you? Please, milord, anything.""

""You need to be punished. The world cannot know what goes on behind these doors.""

I lower my head, still kneeling before you, and I hear you walk behind me, pulling out chains, the whip, the paddle. You come and crouch in front of me, cuffing my hands together, then my ankles, and running a chain between the two. You put my collar on me, tighter than usual, to indicate your displeasure with my behavior.

""You will prove yourself to me by being silent. I want to hear nothing but your breath, no matter what I do. Got it?""

""yes, Milord, yes. anything you ask""

The whip comes down on my back, hard, and I feel welts rising already. Even the endorphines can't drown out the searing pain. I bite my lip, but not a sound comes
from my mouth.

""I'm impressed. Good girl"" you run your hand through my hair, pulling my face against your thigh. The whip comes down again, and I can feel each of it's leather laces sting me again.

You whip me, again and again, sometimes switching to the handle, but usually just lashing me. There are parts of my skin that are open, and bleeding, but I have not made a noise aside from gasps and panting.

""Up. Lay on your stomach on the bed.""

I do as you ask, my knees sore, and my skin aching.

""Face into the pillow. Don't make a sound except to breathe, or I'll make you watch someone else jerk me off, got it? You'll get nothing.""

I feel helpless, small, and inredibly turned on. I lay there. I can hear your lighter, and I wonder what you're doing. I lay there, silent, waiting, for several minutes before feeling the hot wax across the welts. I want to scream, the pain is more intense than anything you've done for me before.

I am silent. You are my Lord, and I do as you ask.

""Not even a flinch, my love, you please me."" I hear you set the candle back down, and feel your hand rubbing against my pussy. ""You're soaked, ready for me, eh?""

I nod.

You slide your hand from my pussy to my asshole, slamming your thumb in. I gasp, but make no other noise.

""I'm going to fuck you now, and you will make not a noise.""

You lay on top of me, my skin burns and stings feeling you against me. You shove your cock down deep in my ass and begin fucking me, hard. The pain mixes with pleasure as you continue. I'm going to cum, hard, and cannot make a noise.

""Oh... am I going to make you cum already?"" you say softly into my ear.

Again, I nod.

""Ah, then, I'll stop."" You pull out, and turn me over. The sheets are sticking to me. ""You don't get to cum yet... get up off the bed and stand before me.

I do as you ask, sore, panting, wanting you so badly, feeling the juices from my pussy dripping out my ass as I stand before you.

""Clean it off. With your tongue. I want to fuck your pussy. Clean off what came from your ass. Lick it.""

I get on my knees and lick you, stem to stern, cleaning you quietly, obediently, holding and caressing your nuts in one hand, and using the other to help clean. I clean every last bit, and you are smiling down at me.

""stand."" you say, and I do.

I am standing before you, naked, trembling, my back covered in raised red welts. You are smiling, a wry smirk, indicating that I am finally going to receive my reward for everything I have done. It's been quite a night for the two of us.

""Good girl. My sweet wife, my lady... you have pleased me, done well.""

I look forward to my reward..."

""do I need to gag you?!?"" you ask, the irritation obvious in your voice
i try to be quiet, but the gasps are louder than i intend
frustrated, you reach below and find a handkerchief
making a gag for your loud lady

you reach down as well and grab your whip
i feel the hard, round handle rubbing against my ass and back
i am hoping you will hurt me with it, and indeed, you do
you are hitting me hard, leaving red marks, i'm sure
the pain is beautiful
please, my lord, more, more...

i can feel you are about to cum, your muscles tense, turn rigid
i can't wait to feel you pulsing inside me
filling me to the brim, leaning against me as your muscles cry for relief
i am panting, thanking you through the gag

my lord amazes me, hurts me, pleases me, keeps me whole
i crave him every minute i am awake
crave his hands touching me
his lips kissing me
his teeth biting me
his fingers, pulling my hair
or clawing my shoulders
his hips, pounding against mine
his cock, tearing me to shreds

i crave him
endlessly, i crave him"

"event","i am dressed tonight for you, my love
the dress wraps me, holds me, encircles my body as i hope you will later
i see flashes of us, in passion
and i look forward to the nighttime adventures to follow

i am made up for you tonight, my love
i hope i please you
i want to be everything for you

i know that you will be stunning
you will take my breath away with your beauty
you will stare at me with those eyes and i will fall
i will be weak on my knees, trembling before you
everything you say will be my every want to do for you

i will pine and ache and want
and you will be in control, and i will love it all the more
you will deny me, and i will have to try again, try harder
be better next time...

to prove my worth to you"

"event","we are fucking like lions - hard, fast, loud
i am provoking, making him show his dominance
i am making my lord prove himself,
being obstinant and playing dom for a minute to get his retribution
his punishment is always smooth and sweet

'you are mine, and you know it'
his voice alone could make me come again and again
he talks and i can feel the heat and wetness building
just listening to him makes me pant and lose control
i will do whatever it is he asks of me

and with a shock, he grabs my hair and pulls
he is fucking me hard and fast and i am screaming for him
calling his name and telling him i'm his
oh, the sweet reward of punishment

he is ready, and he comes all over me
i lay there in the dark, feeding myself from my reward
and we both slip into the oblivion of sleep

only to have another go 'round in the morn."

of my lover's lips against mine
causes fires within my body
my whole self is burning for him

"event","not much to say tonight, but someone stirred a thought in the fetishconfess community.

being written on...
i never thought of it as a turn-on before my lover came along
i'd had lovers previously, tracing words on my back with their fingers, and i remember enjoying the touch

but this last time
my lover
took a pen
and wrote his name across my back
i was his

and he wrote it there for all to see

the pen, the ball point, felt sharp on my skin, and i loved it
and then knowing... that he had written something there, and seeing his reaction to his own writing

it turned me on even more to know he'd written that i was his...
for i am...
...helplessly, hopelessly, happily

his"

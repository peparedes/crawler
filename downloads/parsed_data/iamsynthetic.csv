"event","same shit. different day.

slept.
went to class. went out.
had a time. got sick over jack and the box. got jealous over star wars trilogy not being mine. much ado about nothing.

came home. whined about it on my journal. yadda yadda. perhaps tomorrow will be more exciting.  going to apply at gamestop, where my MAD HOOKUPS might get me a job to fill my target void.  bon soir!"

"event","well. an entirely unexpected wave of goodness. my saturday night didnt suck.

after being at work, which entirely sucked, having been given more work than any person who works at target, i followed it up with a nice coffee with john, kim, and ...stephanie.

stephanie is an asu student majoring in womens studies.  shes a vegan lesbian complete with gender-neutral clothing. got the tongue bar, got the tattoos.  most fun girl ever. loud, outspoken, and a feminist who DOESNT GET DEFENSIVE. 

something has gone right when within 5 minutes of knowing her, you can make a crack at her feminism/lesbianism, and she can come right back at you with some impressive quip.  she knows how to tell a story. she knows how to tell terrible stories well.

so, subtract the feminist part. subtract the lesbian part. subract the vegan part. its a wonder shes unattached. its also nice when they have a sense of humor. why dont more girls have that?  either way. it was exciting to learn what different color handkerchiefs in different pockets mean on gay people.  different strokes for different folks leads to the best conversation ever. ranging from lactating and nipple piercing to acid-tripping raving. ahh. 

why cant more strangers be this instantly comfortable?"

"event","what exactly goes on in a livejournal?  lets see what happens when i write like THE REST OF YOU do.

so yeah um. i woke up this morning. got on the computer AND WAS RUDELY SURPRISED THAT... nothing at all exciting had happened. uh. today ill be going through the routine measures of waking up, spending 4 hours on the computer. standing up from the chair. showering. dressing. driving. working. drive home. (and maybe. since its saturday. drink myself into some sort of catatonic state. then run about the streets in a fashion not unalike will ferell in OLD SCHOOL.)

but if that doesnt happen. more than likely im going to be right back here. typing in my journal about how much i hate asian camera shoppers.

you never know, do you?



oh, and if youre wondering how i can run about the streets ina catatonic state. well. surely youve never been drunk"

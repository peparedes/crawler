This brings us to the month of May...or as the Spanish call it ""Mayo"".  It was in this fateful month that the story of the erroneous error occurred...dun dun dun!!  Knowing he was playing a concert on Cinco De Mayo, he quickly filled in the date on his calendar (May 4th - Show at the Derby).  I sick feeling rushed over him as he rushed to open up the envelope in which sat his tickets to the Daniel Johnston concert.  May 4th.  The date.  The date that sounded really really familiar!  Too familiar!  That was the date of the concert he was playing at the Derby!  Nooooooo!  After some smart thinking, he figured out how he could play the concert at the Derby, and then rush straight on after to Spaceland for Daniel Johnston.  The tension of the whole situation still gnawed at him, tormenting his dreams.

Flash forward to Tuesday night...while attending unsaid concert...He told a friend about the Daniel Johnston concert.  ""What date might this revelry of music fall upon?""  He immediately replied ""May 4th, Cinco De Mayo.""  Then it hit him...after 3 years of failing to learn Spanish...it hit him hard!  THE END"

With such a wooly mammoth, these Deer can persuade the leaders of many great nations to turn over all of their chocolate.  What would happen if the world was to suffer a holiday season without chocolate?

The Facts:

1) Fondue will not be as fun

2)  Jews resorting to using real money instead of foil-covered chocolate substitutes, when gambling with dradel.

3)  No chocolate covered pretzles shaped like Jesus on the cross.

4)  The Easter Bunny will need to start planning for an alternative Easter...and be too busy to ponder the real meaning of Christmas (which he does annually)

5)  B-Horror movies will resort to using ketchup instead of Hershey syrup

6)  People will probably die (thou dog will not have to live in fear)

7)  Rats will take over the human race and Sir Raticlease will rule (of course humans will be slaves, and only be able to be saved by Jesus the Rat...dawning a new era of Human/Rat approbation)

8)  Santa will lose the will to deliever presents (probably start a rice farm somewhere-it will fail-he will then lose the will to live)

9)  A Tarantula name Louise va Derolise will become the president of New America-4 and use giant robots to destroy invading creatures from the heavens.

Minotaur
what more can I say.  We got in something called Minotaur!!  One of the best mythological beasts ever!  I'd say on par with the Manticore.  Currently, The Minotaur Song is in production, on it's way to <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/joeandthechickenheads/snailsounds003.html"">Mr. Snail's Halloween Party.</a>  It shall be magical.

Trader Joes FINALLY got in more Vegetarian Tofu Pad Thai...FINALLY!!  And other than spending my money on Trader Joe's Vegetarian Tofu Pad Thai, I've continue my pursuit of immense Nintendo Game collecting.  It's hard not to buy something when it is so darn cheap.  Bulk is Bad...

I had the worst wine last night...
Lesson Learned:  Just because C.S. is only $2 at TJ's, doesn't mean that $1.25 TJ wine will be any good.  It tastes as if someone added Manishevitz to Charles Shaw...maybe some grape kool-aid too...ooooo yeah!!

If I wanted to buy cheese...I mean...you can't just get cheese...you have to buy a cow...or find a cow I guess...which might be like winning the lotto for a farmer...but you have to buy cheese.

But back to the weekend.  Cinema Sports was most amazingly fun.  The film we (RBHID crew + 2) made was much more than I ever expected.  It was a 80's Film Noir parody...nuff said.  It will be posted on the internet soon.  We got a great response from the view audience, lots of big laughter and praise.  I guess I should have prefaced this:

We had 9 hours to make a film from start to end, including 4 ""ingredients"":
1) A conversation about the spirit world
2) Someone steps on something by accident
3) A close-up of a street sign
4) A secret is revealed

We just made it under time, but due to Cher...we were stuck in mucho traffico, hence making us a bit late...but nothing devastating.

On the otherside...I did something really dumb and hypocritical...
I bought Pixies tickets from TicketMaster...god damn...$15 for just service charges!!
Plus I can't even go, cause I forgot it was the same night as Of Montreal...who, whoop the Pixies (lame for playing crappy venues who use ticketmaster) asses.  So now I need to see if I can find someone who has tickets for the thursday show and wants to trade for the friday show...or sell my ticket.  But yeah...the new Of Montreal album is pretty awesome.  Has some super great songs...""So Begins Our Alabee"" = The coolest 80's slang word you can think of.  Other songs seem like a bit of filler, but are still cool.  All in all a great fun indie dance album...(I don't dance) but now I want to.

Oh!  Second highlight of the weekend...Chris's brother Anthony was in a school musical of the Music Man...the songs in that play suck...but Anthony is amazing!  Such comic character...hillarious...

After some Boys Big Boy with Wes (not an innuendo) we headed over to spaceland for the J Mascis & the Fog concert.  They line wasn't very long, but crowded.  Someone mentioned they were handing out numbers for tickets and only about 100 would get in...We had #150 & #151...and the guy said it was doubtful we'd get in...but we stayed in line...what the hell.  Then I began to think...why would they hand out #'s if there was already a line...I flipped the flyer over to reveal a flyer...it was a fucking flyer...so guys was pretending to hand out number to buy tickets so people would take is stupid flyer!!  We got in without a problem.  Got my giant beer...and toiletpaper earplugs...

First band:
30sec songs loud and energetic...fun...nothing special.

Second Band:
Oooooh boy!!  Supreme Dicks...Wes and I are still confused.  Not only did they take over an hour to setup. But we still aren't sure if they were a novelty act or not.  They were so bad that they were good, then bad again, making them really good...in that funny, Jack Black is standing next to me way.  Lets just say a band with 4 guitar players, one of which we named Magic (dressed in Cheetah print pants and a furry coat, and looked like a woman)...a drummer who played with mallets, and some random guy in a wresting mask and one of those doggy cones around his neck (so he would stop biting his ass?) playing some sort of phototheremin.  After 2 ""songs"" they announced their slide guitar player has arrived...as they proceeded to play, he set up on stage, with a couple other guys just walking around with him...I can't describe in words this band.  Worse than Built To Spill live...songs were amazing thou...epic jam songs with epic vocals...I was thinking that they were retarded, making them pretty good.  But yeah...probably best worst band ever!!

Third Band:
Let me preface...I was planning on seeing J Mascis for a while...didn't think it important to preorder tickets...who really knows who J Mascis is...well...Ron Bentley tells me Dinosaur Jr. got back together, and that tonights show might be a secret Dino Jr. show...which it was...SO FUCKING AWESOME!!  Wes even thought it was amazing and he didn't know a single song!  J Mascis, Lou Barlow...and that other drummer guy...I can check them off the list of bands I'm pissed I never saw cause A:  They broke up before I was old info to go to clubs  B:  They/He Are/Is Dead  C:  They never existed

So to recap:
(not so) Secret Dinosaur Jr. Show
Jack Black
Giant Spaceland Beer
Magic w/the Cheetah Pants

...fill in what I forgot wes..."

<bold>The Ongoing Odyssey of Olladarius:<bold>
Deep in the land of the time before, an ancient valley of fog and mist...
A crushing blow was thrown by Ollardrius the iron fist...
Fire consumed the evil
The dead rise in the heat
The bow of serpent string
Brings men down from their feet
Ollardarius...man of ancient lore be told
Ollardarius...with a mighty will so bold
Thrown in the pits of hell
O wretched fate twas his
Withstand a lash of burden
No way out there is
Ollardarius...with a vengeful creed he swore
Ollardarius...abolish evil evermore
Upon the serpent string
Osiris sins glaze fire
To torment the hearts of all
A suffering mans desire
Ollardarius...and the quest to find the bow
Ollardarius...for failure he does not know
He moves swift like a griffin
Thru darkened watching caves
Into a room of skulls
Fated men in fated graves
Ollardarius...thou he knew his fate did he
Ollardarius...to fulfill his destiny
A lurch of fire brazed him
His feet forged into rock
Emerging from the shadows
A creature began to talk
""Ollardarius...your twisted fate doth be not""
""Ollardarius...in yonder grave you shall rott""
Ollardarius stood brazen
""Malignancy cannot bind me""
He fist thrust into stone
Shattered and he was free
Ollardarius...his iron fist doth just rule
Ollardarius...to smote those wicked and cruel
""Dieing Begoteth the dead""
Shrieked the creature in dire pain
Tis not all fated fortune
For in this land he must remain
Ollardarius...thou his deed may be renowned
Ollardarius...to the underworld he's bound
Vanquished evil from the land
Tragic loss of hero missed
Triumphant days in ancient time
Ollardarius with iron fist

RBHID was a blast...with Wes's Hulk-hands & Kazoo solos, and that guy doing the chewbacca noises...not a single person there got us (who didn't know us).  Brilliant!  Best part...the finnally...a Bentleys cover of punch drunk, with Will Bentley playing drums...on a lefty drumset mind you!  He is that awesome!  And Ron jumped up on stage to help us salvage the song...cause although we rock...only real bentleys can do it justice...alas...they don't play it anymore =(

Sound lady was a bitch...oh dear I miss Paul Ill!

PBA was totally fun...so much room on stage...i just kept dancing/stumbling around in circles...got a recording of the show...hope it came out well.  Go bootleggers go!  Cheeeeese Burger!

Kevin Ridel is a cool guy...we threw back a few PBR's backstage...(no show is complete without a stockpile of PBR)...his band was fun...they wore Chefs Hats...

oh...and totally scared 2 girls away...they were by our merch table so I thought they wanted to buy something, they probably thought I was hitting on them...i'm awesome.

for a side note...Hujojo, the spider monkey in Justins shoe...who nibbles on his toes, is rad."

"event","Once upon a time, cowboy erik (with a ""k"") roamed these neck of the woods.  They were lonely woods, and he was a lonely cowboy.  Fitting this happened to be.  As he walked deeper and deeper into the wood...now named the Ghouly Woods [because]...so to continue...cowboy erik (with a 'k') decided to settle down with a nice cowgirl, and have some cowkids...untilll one day when he was uphoarded for the PIRATES OF MEJFED!!  So terrified to death was Cowboy Erik (with a 'k') that he named the monument after the noble Romulus Kalbinasse.  A royal page to the distant kingdom of Gedhillias.  A kingdom which was later viciously attacked by mean pirates...who didn't share.  Nor care to share.  As caring to share would show weakness on the part of the PIRATES OF MEJFED.  With a gigantic hoolahoop the day was saved with one mighty swoop as the pirates lay in waste, destroied by the valiant Cowboy Erik (with a 'k').  But the danger was not yet averted.  One grumbly giant came waltzing into the town...sat by the river. and drank.  and drank.  and drank.  untill all the water was consumed, leaving non for yonder corn to grow and flourish.  Pestilence flandered through the land like a festering malignancy.  There was only one hope.  The noble Cowboy Erik (with a 'k') swore to save the land.  And so he called to the Gods...Fibius, Mallarium, and Pondimus-Rex...let forth your water and fill this land and it's great valleys.  Only you can prevent forest fires."

The Pillows are such a great band.  For those who do no know of them, the are a Japanese rock band.  Can be found in the show FLCL (a absolute favorite of RBHID---maybe not Wes...he hasn't see it).  But yeah...they sing in Japanese and broken english which sounds japanese, but there songs rock so hard, it doesn't matter what they are saying (""Blues Drive Monster"").  Since when did I ever care about lyrics...Weezer's Green album is much better not listening to the lyrics.  Download and listen to Happy Bivouac ...I'd say buy it, but the Japanese import is $40

Guided By Voices, was probably the best concert I've ever been to.  2 Hour Set.  1 Hour Encore.  Lots of Alcohol...consumed by the band (not me unfortunately).  To bad there will be no more GBV shows =(

So basically...I wanted to start a new band...based on this great band name i had...Troy's Bucket...
Turns out there is already a band with that name *(if I have to explain the reference you shouldn't be reading this)*
Now I have no reason to start a new band...
There is even a band/guy called Chocolate Eruption!!

(please read this list...i know you will agree)

1) I will appoint the first 1st Chimp.  Mr. Bubbleskazoo, the most awesome party chimp in town
2) I will force Nintendo to make a LEFT handed power glove...then finally people can be Nintendo (wo)Man for halloween...dude...with the zapper gun!  and power pad!  total rock!!
3) I will make every country like us (read below for my proposal of how this will be accomplished)
{Proposal}
I will send the tag team of Kool-aid man and Mr. T into every household in every city of every country on every continent...with a message ""I pity the foo' Oh Yeah!""  Imagine the greatness, when they come to YOUR house
4) I will are you still reading.  Trust me, its not that funny now and won't get any funnier.  Probably you will stop reading, umm, sorry,  this sucks and is gonna become a blatent rip off
5) The Family Matters theme song will play in every elevator, and Urkle & Balki (from Perfect Stangers) will be on every TV show!

Next...For Columbus day, I honored Columbus by watching Gremlins (see footnote 2).  The best part was that the tape that I have of it was taped off TV 14 years ago...that's right...1990...Dick Tracy McDonalds commercials and all.  I was 9...scary...that tape is old!

Lastly...I've been working my ass off at work.  They let me cut sound effects for this pilot called ""The Cell"" (see footnote 3) that is going to play on showtime or something like that.  I get to wake up at 3am, and go in and cut effects before the editors come in...but yeah...So i got to make great effects like kids in a bounce house, a skull getting crushed by rocks [which happen to be thrown at the persons head] , oh...and a bullet getting gouged out of an eye socket with a knife (see footnote 8)

footnotes:
1:  The Goose Turkey gang is the gang of homeless people who hang out on sunset/gower in hollywood.  They can usually be found outside of Rosco's Chicken n' Waffles (see footnote 4) or Pinot (see footnote 5) on the other side of the street.  The G.T.G. consists of Gabby Leroy, Grimace, Ho, Kracka-Jack Stevens, and others.
2:  For those in the know, Gremlins was written by Chris Columbus...don't believe me!
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/   (see footnote 7)
3:  I think it is a kids show (this will be funny after reading the rest)
4:  Yum...Waffles
5:  Which I like to pronounce ""peanut"" ... where John Stamos just shot some film or something (see footnote 6)
6:  Uncle Jesse!! (see footnote 19)
7:  Told You!!
8:  Sorry...maybe not.

"event","...is the new Friday the 13th

I guess it came a day early, but at least it broke up the dullness of a 7 day week.  So, it's 6:30am and I'm walking to my car to drive to work.  I open the door (keep in mind I'm extremely tired) first thing I see confuses me.  Why are all my papers from the side door pocket on my front seat...did the wind blow them?  Cause it was a bit draft in my car...oh wait...I can stick my arm thru my window.  Oh look...lots of broken glass!  Wow...what else...oh where is my radio?  Not in MY car...

I racist description of the culprit:
A white trash, mexican, black man.
(not Asians, cause they don't do crime)
But I hope he enjoys my $75 CD player, and my burnt CD collection...oh, and my change drawer.  Man,,,really made out like a bandit.  Glad breaking my window was worth it.  At least Alf and Fez Monkey were safe.

The rest of the day went like clockwork (broken clockwork)...driving around with no music, with a broken window, and all that fun stuff...

but...the ultra super shitty day was turned around when I decided to go to Ron Bentleys B-day party!  So much fun!  Always nice hanging out with Ron and his new laptop.  Ron's mom cooked a wonderful dinner, and everything was okay =)  Thanks Ron...And Happy Birthday!!

____on a different side of the world...I've been dumpster diving trying to collect foam...for my studio!  Yey!  I not only go to play ""She's Like The Wind"" tonight, but also ""Caribbean Queen""!!!  Homo-rabia!!  Going to disneyland tomorrow with my sister...yey!!  Now I just need to find a place to live..."

"event","How often does the opportunity present itself...once, maybe twice in a lifetime!  Wow...only one person will care...that I played Lost In Emotion by Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam.  Wow...this has been a great hour...Right now is Don't Wanna Miss A Thing (Aerosmith)...earlier was Hey Ya (Outkast), Crazy In Love [no rap version] (Beyonce)...all topped off with Lisa Lisa!  Wow...Wow...Wow.

Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle is most awesome.  See it...I'm serious.

I also decided I want British children.  British children are the best!  So proper and accented.  One of the guys at work (who happens to be British) brought in his kids, and they were awesome!  The little boy about 6 or so tried to hustle me into taking a collection of spoons and forks he managed to collect through out the office...after telling him I'd have to sleep on it, he proceeded to put the utensils back in his bag, which was full of other stolen office supplies.  Most Righteous!  So cute...I need British children...so single British women...pick up your phone!!

I guess I won't talk around the kids and ruin their pure accent.  They will grow up thinking their father is a mute...but in fact, just protective...of their precious accents!  I already got a name.  Cotton Bobbins.  Cotton Bobbins Krane.  PERFECT!!  And if there are too,,,um...the other one can be Lisa Lisa.  Lisa Lisa Krane...DONE"

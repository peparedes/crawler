i'm going to blame cee-lo for this adaptation of the talking heads' ""sugar on my tongue."" he seems like the kind to own their greatest hits collection, and besides, i like him more than the rest of these knuckleheads on this track. don't get me wrong, i used to love luda, but it's getting a bit old.

i went crazy when i heard this song on the radio yesterday and tried to call matth so that he could hear it. it didn't work, so now i present this file for him (and you!):

the theme of today's post is: fear! 

first off is the father of christian pop music, larry norman. i'd wanted to start getting some of his records for my born-again father, but unfortnately the 2 or so i've found kinda suck. i want my dad to start listening to good music again, so these records are stuck in my collection. the only salvagable thing i could pull off is ""the last supper"", a neil-youngy/singer-songwriter ballad about missing the rapture. the piano smashing part is cool the first few times, but then it just become part of the routine and isn't as interesting anymore... hey, kinda like church!

our next guest is a man who appears to have been a local children's entertainer in the late 70's around the twin cities. sadly, i don't have a scanner and can't find a thing about our friend captain cookie on the internet, so you'll just have to use your imaginations: picture a cross between the live-action luigi from the super mario bros. super show and a chef with a cape. picture him handing out cookies to elementry schoolchildren. picture him releasing a record called ""captain cookie's 'good thinking jamboree'"" with the words ""why are you so impatient... i could hit you with my hand! what's wrong with all you kids today... i just don't understand!"" displayed on the front cover...

now imagine him telling you to laugh away all your fears and LAUGHING LIKE HE DOES IN THIS SONG! tell me you're not more afraid than when you started and i'll call you a goddamn liar!

"event","it's very painful to use slsk on a dial-up connection (yes, they still make those!) music creeps in so...very...slowly, taunting you, almost making you angry for wanting to hear it. i'm finding it hard to justify some of my lamer choices. a folder full of barry white productions? sounds interesting, yes, but i have to dequeue it in favor of the new hold steady record. i'm more curious about that and it'll be less embarassing to chat about that than barry white.

with that in mind, this post is actually about barry white. i only started downloading the aforementioned folder after doing a general search for the good mr. white. why would i do that? isn't the stigma of generic fuck music enough to keep me away? normally, yes. i think i understand the music and message of barry white well enough to not have to listen to it. (no, i'm not really sure what that sentence is supposed to mean either. -ed.) but a memory of my recent trip to austin keeps coming back and nagging the back of my mind to the point where i just had to hear a specific string of songs.

these songs are ""love's theme"" though ""never gonna give you up"" from the album <i>love songs</i>. generic title, generic sentiment, right? yeah, probably. to be honest, i'd never actually listened to these beyond muzak speakers and lite-rock backround music stations at stores and doctor's offices. this was until the asshole soundman at a club called ""friends"" (ironically the rudest fucking club in austin) put this record on between set changes. one thing that just about all good fuck music has in common is booty shaking (stimulating) bass and these songs were no exception. the bass was cranked in this place to where you could feel the thumping right in your gut. there was no way to ignore what i was hearing. 

it all made sense. i still don't know what they mean, despite my previous claim that i ""get it"", but i could hear beyond the waka-waka guitars and the strings of the love unlimited orchestra to finally appreciate the sentiment behind this previously vapid music. they're really not kidding when they say ""the men don't know, but the little girls understand.""

overall, after listening to the songs again, it's really not the same. it was obviously an experience tied entirely to the moment, the location and maybe even the people (asshole soundman discluded because he was probably just trying to be annoying.) the music itself becomes a cheap souvenior, no replacement for the memory. you are accepted, barry white, no longer just a cartoon character in my eyes.

there's what the aislers set look like. i didn't know that til just now. we listened to them a few times in texas as tony had just gotten into them. he kept pronouncing their name ""eyeslers"", which i thought was cute. angela did it too because he learned of them from tony.

<img src=""http://www.wtbr.com/Synopsis/Images/tonang1.jpg"">
that is not what tony and angela look like.

my ride to the bus station was colored by ""how i learned to write backwards."" it's always a neat thing to hear a previously-obsessed-over record in a new but familiar context. the last time i recall listening to it was during the unseasonably warm late winter of last year. ben and matt and i were hanging out in the garage for no real reason probably talking about how great this record was. 

i put this same song on a cd for a girl during a trying time in whatever relationship we were having at the time. she never commented. i don't blame her. it's such a ""something's wrong and instead of dealing with it, i'm gonna wallow"" kind of song. i almost wished she'd called me on my bullshit. this time though the song came on in the middle of such a situation not of my volition. again, i made too much of it and wallowed. at least i can call myself on my own bullshit now.

ignore the above. this is a nice song.

the scene: super secret listening preview party of the as-yet-untitled radiohead album. only the most elite of journalists and label execs have been invited. the exception? two wiry homosexuals who've had limited exposure with the outside world since their discovery of the internet and music message boards. they have arrived at mecca. this is the most exciting day of their lives. they are prepared to dance and fully absorb what they're about to hear. sure, they've never learned to dance, but when the music hits you, it's a primal reaction, right? right.

the record begins and our heroes are overcome with a feeling not unlike the onset of cheap ecstasy. they flail about at the smooth (but not amazing) programming and thom yorke's smooth trademark voice. the first boy, who we'll call michael, moves his mouth to the words perfectly. one would swear it were his own voice and not thom's. boy number two though, who we'll call daniel, reacts in a much stranger way. he beings to scream. loudly. not a scream of joy, but something much more violent and commanding. 

it's almost like something new. it's not, really. mom packed them a nice turkey sandwich and a pudding cup for lunch; idiot pilot are dunking that sandwich in the pudding and throwing it at you. 

(this is the oh so clever review i wrote after the show. they don't come off as radiohead-y on their recordings, which is almost to their disadvantage.)

since i can't upload from this computer, i'll have to be boring and point you to <a href=""http://idiotpilot.com/sound.htm"">the soundclips on their website</a>. ""to buy a gun"" was the song i heard that made me curious about seeing them. most of their songs seem to follow the same formula."

this is not, i repeat, NOT a reflection on my mood upon arriving in san antonio. in fact, this was pretty much the first time i actually listened to the lyrics of this absurd suicide song by apparent northern soul chanteuse ede robin. i can't find any information on her at all, presumably because she really did kill herself after writing this. i mean, it's not even cute or ironic in any way. this is the voice of your average 15 year old black-dyed cutter. i wonder if they had those in the 60's.

That she had brought a small amount of cotton,
That she would like to spin at night,
So that she would like to spin at night,
So that she could light her lantern of conversation.

They brought the cow dung to light the lantern of 
    conversation.
Sumaworo had all the musical instruments,
All the musical instruments.
They were all first brought out by Sumaworo,
Except for the <i>bala</i>.
He brought out the <i>kerelengkengbeng</i>,
He brought out the <i>koworo</i>,
He brought out the <i>donso nkoni</i>,
He brought out the three-stringed <i>bolon</i>,
He brought out the <i>soron</i>,
He brought out the <i>kora</i>,
That came out after all the instruments,
And that is why they call it <i>ko la</i> (""later on"" in pop. etymology).
That is why they call it the last of all musical

Then it came to be called <i>kora</i>.
That one is played in Kita,
It is played in Senegal.

the first song is by david porter. porter was a songwriting partner of isaac hayes at stax records, and, like hayes, recorded some crazy stuff of his own. this song is from his album entitled ""victim of the joke?: an opera."" its a concept record about a failing relationship. i haven't heard the rest of it, but damn-this track is strange. the breakdown in the middle is bizarre, and features the male and female protagonists talking to one another, then porter having some sort of seizure before returning to the chorus. i found it on a compilation i downloaded called ""shaolin soul 1,"" comprised of songs sampled by the wu tang clan. i spent a lot of time listening to the 36 chambers when i was in high school, but i can't place this one like i can for most of them. this is further proof (along with kill bill) that RZA, despite making some real crap (including a shitty concept record of his own, which also deals with a fucked relationship) has incredible taste in music. except for that crappy theme song with the horns.

this peaches clone is, um, a friend of peaches. her name is mignon and, like peaches, she kinda sucks. this song falls in the genre of anonymous, shitty conversation songs. what sets it apart is the fact that mignon, who is a berliner, is rapping at a drunk scottish hooligan. and its very vulgar. the best part is when he goes ""MY DICK IS FOOOKIN'HUGE!""

<i>RG: Could you simply explain the process of Frippertronics?

RF: Yes. I record on the left machine, the guitar is recorded on the left
machine, the signal passes along the tape to the right machine where it's
played back to the left machine and recorded a second time.

RG: OK.

RF: The signal recorded the second time passes along the tape to the right
machine where it's played back a second time and recorded a third.

RG: And at what point is it released into the room?

RF: Oh, straightaway. Unless, what I could do if I wanted to be crafty,
would be to build up a chord which no one could hear and then turn the
chord on, but, in fact, that doesn't happen. I've only done that, I think,
on a couple of occasions. You hear it happening.

my dad named my brother justin after justin hayward of the moody blues. he once told me that thought about naming me levi after levi stubbs of the four tops. would that have been sweet or what?

unlike the temptations, the tops seem to have managed to avoid putting out too much crap. well, they put out a country album and probably an xmas record, but i can forgive them because of songs like this.

ps. find every volume of beg, scream and shout in your record store or your slsk queue asap."

now this is interesting. one of the first times i remember being aware of sampling was when i noticed the record pops at the beginning of house of pain's ""jump around."" the quick shift in fidelity made me notice that that horn intro was obviously from some other song. at the time, i thought ""hmm, that's interesting"" and never really thought of it again until this past weekend. we were at <a href=""http://www.fleetfarm.com/"">mills fleet farm</a> listening to a surpisingly good soul muzak mix when those familiar horns came over the speakers. i was briefly taken aback (""they're playing jump around!?"") until i realized that THIS WAS THE SONG THEY'D TAKEN THE HORNS FROM. it sounded like marvin gaye over their pa and was interrupted by a call for someone in automotive, but there was the song!

12 years later, it's much easier to find out sample sources. a quick query on <a href=""http://www.the-breaks.com/perl/search.pl?term=house+of+pain&type=6"">the-breaks.com</a> lead me to this mp3 of bob and earl's <a href=""http://s18.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=2JSLI49OL731S0OWV8X06VV6X6"">harlem shuffle</a>. put this on a cd and psych out your friends who will be preparing to go crazy like they're in a pringles commercial."

around the time that i started stealing my parents' record collection, i noticed that my mom had a pretty large collection of bee gees records. i found it strange that she had as many bee gees records as beatle records. it just didn't make sense to 13-yead old me. it was a while before i tried playing these records; i don't remember why i did, in fact. perhaps i thought i'd camp things up a bit with a little disco dancing. instead, i was confronted with shit like ""i started a joke.""

...

what the hell was going on here? not only were these guys really fucking sad, it sounded like someone was physically shaking them as they cried. this was BETTER than any imagined closet-queening. this actually made sense in context with those beatle records. i felt like i'd discovered some crazy secret that my friends would never understand, or at least take seriously. it wasn't ""stayin' alive""... more like ""rather be dead."" this is what i secretly latched onto instead of the smiths or something more traditional like that. if wes anderson's ever allowed to make another film, this song will probably end up on its soundtrack. then everyone will know. everyone will listen to those one or two songs and proclaim themselves cool and informed (see also nico and nick drake.)

i collect pre-crap children's records. with the introduction of casiotone-style synths, it became very easy to make a kids record. you didn't hear as many crazy, joyous records that just had a singer, a guitar and a circle of kids. instead, it's reduced to overly-sweet ""wheels on the bus"" cartoon inanity. 

strangely enough, the kind of music ella jenkins and others of her ilk (tom glazer, malvina reynolds, bruce haack and ester nelson, etc) is in vouge again in the underground. now it's being played by the likes of animal collective and devandra banhart (who covered ella on his last record, if memory serves.) hell, even raffi has found hipster acceptance what with the popular <a href=""http://www.filmbuffs.net/bananana/"">bananaphone</a> meme. now is the time to download this track and add it to that sweetly ironic mix cd you're making for that cute girl that works at the cafe.

haw haw, this is funny and creepy cause i don't speak their language. i would assume our children's puppet stars sound the same to non-english speakers (ie. terrorists.) here's some info i stole from one of those terrorist sites:

""Kaj is a very proud and stubborn male frog, and Andrea a very fine and lovely female parrot. They are fairly standard representatives of the educational-children's-TV-puppet genre. Kaj would probably be right at home with Ernie and Bert, and Andrea with Big Bird.""

this site (which is <a href=""http://www.justmorons.com/articles/day041108.html"">right here</a>) also happens to translate today's song into english. the song, which roughly translates to ""left right"" apparently has political meaning to this guy. if he's saying that these puppets are meant to be right-wing, then perhaps there really is a good reason to be frightened by their voices.

today we hear from dion, sans belmonts. sometime in the late 60's, doo wop idol dion dimucci slapped on a new coat of paint and became a topical songster. the result, his record company hoped we would believe, was ""the birth of an extraordinary artist... his singing now expresses his personal world."" ironic, then, that no less than 6 of the 10 songs on his record are covers of song by joni mitchell, stevie wonder, leonard cohen and, tragically, jimi hendrix. this song is a reworking purely because, frankly, i don't think dion really had any idea of how the song went. here we hear a travesty of shatner-like proportions... and goddamn if i don't actually like this song.

when i work at estate sales, i grab as many blank-looking tapes as possible. mostly, i grab the ones that say ""vacation"" or ""easter"" or some other personal thing on them. i'm both flabbergasted that they are available for sale and curious as to their content. i used to think this was a weird interest, but the internet reveals thousands of others who are into ""found objects.""

anyway, i have a few tapes from this family. i've long since forgotten their name and where they lived, sadly. this is apparently a family that liked to drink and sing. i didn't really have grandparents, but i wonder if they would have been like this. probably not. there's a lot of goofing and arguing going on on these tapes. maybe i will encode them all one day, but for now here's <a href=""http://s3.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=0TA69BOFIUAYI3MDXCR6V2KF29"">moon river.mp3</a>"

today's post is coming from my brother's computer in blaine, mn. i decided on the ride out here that i'd use his MP3 collection to update my loyal handful of readers. unsuprisingly, there's a lot of funny/violent rap on here. what comes as more of a suprise to me is that he has about 32 folders in his ""local"" section full of underground rappers i have never heard of. good for him. i'm glad he's into being a part of a scene, even a strange one full of local juggalo rappers.

what amazed me even more is the folder labeled ""lug"". this is my bro's ""rap name."" he appears to be involved in a war with a rapper called tha menace, a kid signed to oddballer records. there are a few mixtape-sized snippets of lug dissing menace, mostly consisting of accusations of gayness.

EVEN MORE AMAZING IS A FULLY-REALIZED PARODY OF GANGSTA'S PARADISE CALLED <B>FAT KID PARADISE</B>! 

<a href=""http://s21.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=9638AC6A602815E9F1777D7DA2BFAC41"">lug - fat kid paradise.mp3</a>

here it is, stolen from his computer without his permission. i'm sure he's shown his fellow juggsters, but they don't count. this is an instantmovement exclusive.

as far as fat kid in mom and dad's basement hip hop goes, it's pretty good. you can tell he's rapping into a computer mic over some passable fruityloops beats. i'm kinda proud that he's moved on to actually making little recordings instead of just writing verses. his influences (biggie and violent j) frequently shine though, but we all start somewhere. eventually, he'll probably lose interest in the wicked clowns and start to come into his own. he's a clever/vulgar child and i'm confident he could at least be a popular internet meme. :)"

thanks for your update, matt. it would mean more if i didn't know you were just avoiding writing a paper. keep 'em comin' though.

here's another song that made me want to have a blog to share with. fans of ""little trouble girl"" will immediately recognize this style that the shangri-las are famous for. nobody did teen heartbreak with speak-sung vocals the way these girls did. i like to think this song is the reason my mom didn't move out of her mom's house til her 30's, but i don't know if she's even heard it. all i know is that it makes me wanna go back home.

this is one of the first pieces of ""out there"" music i was exposed to. a guy on my block, mark mojdehi of the ""band"" negro, gave me a tape copy of throbbing gristle's greatest hits. this is the first track from that tape and, let me tell you, it disturbed me. my nirvana-lovin' self could not get my head around WHY someone would do something like this. this was music? it took a while before i decided that, yes, this was music and yes, this was pretty fucking great. some time after that, i heard a noise record mark and his friend had done. it was a completely black 7' (with a black inner sleeve, even!) that didn't sound right played at any speed. i was mystified that people were making music like this. it was even stranger that people in a relatively boring NE mpls neighborhood were doing these things. mark and hamburger lady are pretty much the reason that i don't worship michael stipe (but still have appreciation for such things.)

there are some songs that are great all the way though. usually, these songs are short or at least repetetive. very often though, there are songs that take a while to get awesome. today's post is kind of the opposite of the chills one for a few days back which, as gabe noted, starts out super awesome and then just settles into good. kandy korn, off the captain beefheart album <i>mirror man</a> starts as a quirky bluesrock sorta thing and then drifts off into different sections of awesomeness. the song itself switches gears somewhere aronud the 2 minute mark and goes through some awesome changes. they're not crazy spazz changes, but slow ones that develop over a couple of bars. it's a loose, unpolished track that reminds me a lot of playing with friends in the basement, nodding to each other to signal the next section. it's someting i've only been able to do with a few musicians, but when it works, it's almost transcendent.

"event","i've spent the morning writing a particularly draining letter and decided not to leave the house to send it. it's snowing, you see? i think this is the first snow of the season. it's not really good enough to go out and play in yet. it needs to be colder so i can make snowballs and snow angels and snow forts and other snow joys.

in the spirit of this letter writing and cold morning, i offer you one of the best things lou barlow ever laid to hissy tape. it's from a 3x7"" boxed set called ""magic ribbons"" that also featured the likes of unrest and king missle. unfortunately, i lost the rest of the box in a housefire a few years ago; all i have left is the sebadoh/king missle disc. i barely have the sebadoh side anymore; it's almost worn out. if i had a better rip of it, i'd post the entire side for you, but all i can offer today is <a href=""http://d10.yousendit.com/E/8EA130F3CEFA07602786501EB6119674/sebadoh%20-%20jaundice%20(newer%20mix).mp3"">sebadoh - jaundice (newer mix).mp3</a>. it's a cleaner mix that what's on the record, which unfortunately makes it a little different, but no less enjoyable.

this has been a mixed tape staple of mine since probably 10th grade. anyone who's ever gotten the generic-but-heartfelt ""hey, i think you're pretty awesome"" mix from me has heard this song. have agood weekend, you guys. i'll try to update soon.

warning: it's a 20mb zipped .wmv file.

not only will he be defending the title he won in the video, he'll also be guest rapping with someone called Fat C. 

also, there will likely be a crazy 600 lb. rapper there. who would want to miss that?"

i am perfectly content knowing nothing about the chills. i know that they were from new zealand and put out a bunch of singles that allegedly trump their later output. most importantly, they wrote and recorded a fucking awesome song called ""pink frost"" that i would like to share with you today. i'd like to say that it's connected with the current holiday, but it really isn't. um... it was kind of cold today. there, there's the connection. whoo!

that, friends, is emocapella. bet you can't guess what they do from their name, huh? that's right, they're not content to just wear their hearts on their sleeves, they're holding them out to be punched. they deserve it too. it takes one jackass called dashboard confessional to perform this song, but somehow it takes that huge crowd to recreate it. i'm sure i'm missing the point, but whatever. here's <a href=""http://s13.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=0835D07B0E5B52A9FD4A9C3579AF154F"">emocapella - again i go unnoticed.mp3</a>"

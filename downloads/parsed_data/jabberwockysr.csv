Prone to self-doubt when others are rightly confident in me, occasionally prone to arrogant self-confidence when others rightly doubt me, and always totally losing all sense of time when engrossed in a good game.  (I think I'm not alone in that, judging from the fact that Civ4 let's you set an alarm clock in-game)

Spent years with depression, and still getting used to life without it.  I've found myself backsliding a time or two recently, but I think it's mostly linked to not getting enough sleep.  Except for once or twice, I haven't been suicidal for over a year and a half.

I am a Christian, and have taught Sunday school a few times now.  I find the <i>New International Commentary on the New Testament</i> to be invaluable in that and highly recommend it to anyone interested, particularly the commentary on Hebrews by F.F. Bruce.

Politically I have Libertarian tendencies, though I'm not so much of an optimist as to think the government will significantly shrink within my lifetime.  I simply cannot understand why anyone would think that anarchy or communism are good ideas.  I would prefer for our government to wrap up the military actions currently ongoing, intervene in Darfur, and then refrain from engaging in hostilities so long as there is no moral imperative to do otherwise."

Saw an allergist and had an allergy panel run, found out that I am not, in fact, allergic to peanuts.  I may react as though I'm on some vile combination of a bad LSD trip and dying of dehydration, but it's not an allergy.  Some form of CNS reaction was the allergist's best guess, perhaps some form of migraine minus most of the headache.  I don't know how much stock I put in his theory, but I believe him that it's not an allergic form of reaction.  (No hives/itching and no cardiac/respiratory symptoms in spite of delayed systemic reaction.  He had no doubt whatsoever that I'm not allergic)  Haven't bothered to go back to my family doc yet, as I doubt she'll have anything to say about it, nor is she likely to refer me to a neurologist.  On the upside, OTC migraine meds do seem to be more effective than benedryl in alleviating a reaction, but still far too slowly for my liking.

Starting the adoption process, my wife is currently looking into adoption agencies.  Family tradition and all, not blazing any trails when I have 8 adopted cousins, an adopted aunt, and an adopted grandfather.

They were giving out donuts at work this morning, most of which had either peanuts on them or coconut.  I'm allergic to peanuts and only like coconut in the form of rum, so I grab one that looks to be a maple donut after making sure it didn't have any stray peanut bits.  As I'm waiting for some apple cider, the person handing out the donuts mentions to the next person in line that the tray I'd grabbed from was all peanut butter frosting...

Cue anxiety attack.  I immediately practically threw the donut back in the box (5 feet away) and found myself on the far end of the table.  I don't remember moving to get there, I was just <b>there</b>, breathing hard, lightheaded, with a mix of fear and adrenaline flooding through my veins.  I hadn't yet smelled that the frosting had peanuts, so I know it wasn't an allergic reaction, merely a psychological response.

I don't like overreacting, being controlled by fear like that.  Yes, I have to always entirely avoid peanuts, but once I get away, that should be the end of it.  Shaking like a leaf after getting rid of it doesn't help anything.  Inconveniently, as I understand it, behavioral therapy is the most effective way to deal with phobia/anxiety type issues, and that translates into exposing yourself to it until you can overcome your fear...  I have my fear <i>because</i> of what happens when I'm exposed to it.

Samantha (one of the high school kids in our church's youth group) was introducing me to a friend of hers that she'd brought.


Additional commentary on the previous entry:
No one lives forever, and with cancer like that, no one wants to.  I miss Gramma, but I'm glad she's not living through that any more.  Her last words were telling Grampa that she loved him, her last breath was when my mom told her it was ok for her to go.  It hurts.  I miss her."

I'll be heading over on Sunday.  Don't know if I'll be able to get any work done today, but I'm going to try.  Won't do anybody any good if I'm moping around about it, right?

So yeah, not going to be taking her out to dinner as her Christmas present.

I wish I'd visited more of the times that we were in GR.  Yeah, we already had 10,000 things to do each time, but I still wish."

As of yesterday, they'd blocked off her right lung completely, and cluttered up her left lung so much that on 5L of oxygen, she was still down to a pulse oxygen level of 84% or so, from 94% the day before.  (95% is considered the lower bound of normal apparently)  Given that she was conscious for a grand total of 10 minutes yesterday, (and not fully coherent at that)it's going to be any time now.  No call yet though."

"event","Not to mention that Gramma has pneumonia too.  (The fact that my family leaves me far enough out of the loop that all I knew about was that it had hit the lymph nodes is a rant for another time)

*sigh* No one lives forever, but I don't want her to die yet.
<lj-cut text='Sad details'>
She's almost 70, so it's not as though she's young, and having had a pack/day habit for somewhere around 50 years it's not surprising for her to have cancer in her lungs.  Surprising that it's skin cancer rather than lung cancer, but not a shock.  (Grampa got cancer about <i>ten years after</i> he quit smoking)

Anyway, they'd treated the skin cancer about 4 years ago, she'd had every type except melanoma because of how much tanning she did when she was younger.  No melanoma = good, right?  Well, squamous cell skin cancer is apparently one of the deadlier cancers once it gets inside, to the point that people die too quickly to participate in studies on it, and thus there is <b>NO</b> FDA approved treatment for it.  No FDA approval = no coverage for the treatment.  Chemo at $4k per shot for 12 weeks...

They found it in the lymph nodes in her breasts a few months ago, suspicious spots in her lungs around Thanksgiving, now verified along with spots in her bones.

Combine this with the pneumonia she just got, only one lobe of her lung, but even so it has he gasping for breath after she walks up the stairs from the car to her living room.  Add chemo on top of that, and her hemoglobin is down, so standing for 10 minutes is exhausting...

She's on IV antibiotics to deal with the pneumonia, but until they know how that goes they've got my little sister in CO on call for flying in because they're not sure how long there is...

The thing is, she's had at least some skin cancer for 20+ years and didn't get any of it treated until just after my wedding.  THat makes me mad, even though I know there's not a damn thing that can be changed about it now.  I'm going to miss her...  And she's too tired right now for company, <u>especially</u> my boys.  At least she was still doing well at Christmas, and has a decent chance to recover enough from the pneumonia to have fun seeing my boys again.  If not, Jess and I can drop them off with her parents so we can see her.</lj-cut>"

"event","It's interesting to look back and consider how differently emotions can seem.  When I was depressed, I barely felt any emotions.  Sure, I'd feel good or feel down, but that was the state of how I was doing, not a reaction to what was going on.  Well, not exactly.  It's hard to describe, but emotions just really didn't have much pull on me.  Sure, I could get angry, or be pleased, but it was much more of a decision on my part rather than a reaction.

To illustrate, my friends Dave and Mary moved 3 1/2 hours away before I was treated for my depression.  Yes, I missed them, but it didn't really affect me emotionally.  Last week my friends Gary and Eliecia moved, and I felt the loss before I thought about it.  I miss them because I <i>miss</i> them, not because we won't hang out and play Halo anymore.

It's rather similar to depth perception.  With my previous glasses, there was something wrong with them (And being about 5 years old, they were somewhat abused and the prescription was off) that made it so I really had no depth perception.  I could interpolate the shape of objects and how far away they were, but it just wasn't something I could <i>see</i> without trying to figure it out.  (This made me absolutely wretched as an outfielder)  When I first put on my new glasses, it was like life had suddenly become one of the ""Magical Eye"" pictures.  (The ones where you cross your eyes and see depth in the picture)  Everything had SHAPE, not just outline, and with being so long since I'd had that, it overwhelmed my vision for a while.  In a way, it made it hard to see colors and detail because the shape of everything was so strong.

The change wasn't as drastic with starting to really feel emotions, but it still catches me just as much by surprise.  I was accustomed to having conscious control over my emotions, not quite to the point of being a Vulcan, but really not so far as you'd think.  Not being able to postpone an emotional reaction or detach myself and analyze it was rather frightening the first time.  I'd honestly always assumed that people who became overcome with emotion were weak, since the last time I'd had that problem was in 7th or 8th grade.  In both vision and emotions I feel in ways like I'm late to the game and everyone else had finished learning the rules long ago.

On the other hand, I get to look around my desk and be amazed like a little kid by the fact that the ball is a SPHERE and the Kleenex box is a BOX.  Heh, blessed are the easily amused, for we shall always be entertained.  I can discuss comparative economic theory with an econometrician (Really, did Marx ever bother to think?), derive a statistical test for the Poisson distribution (Why is that not in my stats books?), and teach pastors something they hadn't recognized from the book of Hebrews (Take a closer look at Hebrews 10:19), and here I am having fun with depth perception in regard to everyday objects.  And reveling in the fact that I can feel enjoyment from doing it."

"event","Finkielkraut was sued by several French NGOs after Le Monde published mistranslations and out of context excerpts from the Haaretz article.  He issued an apology (Mostly apologizing for the mistranslations on Le Monde's part from how I read it) and they have withdrawn their lawsuits.

I'm not really surprised that there were lawsuits, he'd said within the article itself that he was saying things that were illegal to say in France, regardless of how accurate and honest they may be.  It is at least somewhat refreshing to see that the air of anti-intellectualism isn't limited to the US."

<i>Text removed to abide by Haaretz terms of use.</i>

I learned more about what's going on in France from this article than from all I've read on BBC Online.

One of the particular things an American should see in this is a comparison to the race riots that have occured here.  Obviously the factors are not identical, but there is more overlap than many will admit.  As Finkielkraut says, we should use ""the language of truth"" in discussing social issues, rather than relabeling rioters as ""protestors"" or ""youths""."

"event","The habits of depression run deep.  My personal worst ones are double standards and using the word ""should"".  I find myself far too easily criticizing myself for something that I might very well consider remarkably well done if I'd observed it in others rather than done it myself.  Setting prefection as your standard can be done wrongly, let me assure you.

And a rather large percentage of the time that I use the word ""should"" are times I need to remind myself that it's <i>not</i> the end of the world as we know it, so it's ok to feel fine.

This has been Steve's internal monologue of the day.  Thanks go to Julia for kicking me out of my slump."

"event","Gave myself a panic/anxiety attack last night.  That was fun.[/sarcasm]

Earlier I'd been pondering how easily I could have reacted badly enough to have died Monday, which of course provides a wonderful frame of mind for dealing with my newly expanded fear of peanuts.  Then as I was dropping off some of the cardboard blocks for the toddlers (The lesson was on the Tower of Babel, so the game required as many blocks as I could find), I hear one of the kids asking for more peanut butter...

I pause, sniff, smell it, hold my breath, drop the blocks and walk out quickly.  Once I was out of the room I broke into a run to get away because I was <b>terrified</b>.  Of course, all this worrying is enough to induce a panic attack, hyperventilation and all.  This makes me worry whether it's the allergic reaction, sending me even further into panic.

I finally sat down and prayed, which helped immensely.  Got a hug from a friend, which helped too.

I'm not quite 25 yet, aren't I still too young to be mortal?

In any case, I see my doc at 9:30, so I'll likely get an epi-pen.  (Not only is it <i>like</i> a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart, that's really what it is)  I'm fairly certain that'll help me avoid panicking about it in the future."

"event","My mind and body are finally fully functional again.  (Ok, as functional as they were before 2PM Monday)

Amazing how kind and accomodating HR can be when something like that happens.  I got the impression that the HR director would have been willing (reluctantly, but willing nonetheless) to declare the entire building a peanut-free zone if I'd demanded it.  Entertaining though that power would have been to abuse, I decided to be reasonable.  (""I'll be fine with it just so long as it's either sealed or away from me"")

Of course, memories of the other, less friendly, face of HR are linked with the deceased director, so the differences could be due to that change.  (Citing ERISA to deny me a benefit I was requesting, when a more thorough read of the law showed that if that law was applicable, I was being unfairly denied quite a large number of benefits.  They back-pedalled rapidly at that point.  And threatened to fire me if I talked to the CEO about the issue)"

"event","Ok, it was about 5 minutes after I wrote that last post that I nearly passed out.  I could barely lift a small cup of water...  Got to ride an ambulance, that was an interesting thing to get to do.

I was ridiculously weak, to the point that Joe was holding my shoulder to keep me from falling out of the wheelchair while we waited for the ambulance.  Didn't have any trouble breathing, but that's the only symptom of anaphylactic shock that I managed to miss.

ER doc told me to talk to my PCP about getting an epi-pen for the future, as the next time could be fatal otherwise.  How fun.  I hate needles, I don't want to have to do that to myself.  (Better than dying of strangulation from an allergic reaction, but still don't want to have to do it)"

"event","I hate it when my body feels weak.  There was a tray with peanut butter on it in the kitchen here at work.  No big deal, I haven't had a big reaction to peanuts for a while now, right?

Wrong.

<lj-cut text=""Oh the fun it brings!"">3 seconds after smelling it, my appetite is gone
5s My stomach begins to turn
15s My stomach warns me that any further provocation will result in loss of lunch.  Arms and legs inform me of limited willingness to cooperate.
20s Then lightheadedness begins.  Oh joy.

It's been at least 10 minutes now.  I'm not lightheaded anymore, but I know that's only because I'm not standing.  Janet informed me that I look stoned.  ""And not the good kind of stoned either.""  I'm still feeling so weak that my cup is heavy.

I'm really not sure why I reacted that badly though.  I'd never had quite that much of a reaction before.  I know that it could be psychosomatic, but the only thing I've had psychosomatic reactions to is the thought of blood draws.  On the other hand, it had been there a while, and inhalation is the most efficient method of exposure.  I don't know.</lj-cut>

Hopefully some benedryl will help."

"event","Frustrating enough that I'd had an error in my query.  There are only about 100 CPT-4, ICD-9 UB-92, DRG and LOINC codes to type into the query but the mistake couldn't be there, I'd forgotten to change a link property and left the diag requirement on one line of the criteria.

I fix the error I saw, which identified 1 more line than previously, (initial pull of 4k lines) then a minor change that shouldn't have made any damn difference suddenly identifies the 20k rows I'd been missing.

I hate it when the damn query front-end plays fast and loose with the SQL.  Hopefully Hetal will be able to get the MySQL course through the budget process so I can debug some way other than ""Well, it should already work, let's try swapping the order of the criteria.""

Of course, if my data tables had been complete in the first place I wouldn't have had this problem.  Why are not all providers listed in the specialty table?  They all <i>have</i> at least one specialty."

"event","We had good news at work yesterday, we're listed in US News and World Report as a top health plan for Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare.

[/serious]This is all well and good, but the way they chose to celebrate has led me to a new revelation in the plot to poison me.  Either the CEO or someone close to him is in on it, as they gave out Cracker Jacks to celebrate our ""cracker jack"" performance.  The unfunny pun does little to hide their ominous intent of filling the entire building with the poisonous fumes of peanuts.  Thankfully, working in a building filled with women, most of them are on diets that prohibited them from eating it at work. (Calories that no one sees you eat don't count apparently.  I don't pretend to understand their reasoning)

In other news, two of my coworkers have declared me to be Shaggy from Scooby-Doo only without the pot.  (quote: ""I can't picture Steve smoking pot""  Reasonable enough, as I don't even know what pot smells like)  All I need is orange bell-bottoms and I'll have a good Halloween costume.

Edit: Forgot to mention the peanutbutter M&Ms, those are perhaps the vilest portion of the plot, as I can't even trust something that should be chocolate any longer.  At least the peanut M&Ms had the decency to be distinguishable..."

I haven't changed my journal since I got it back in 2002, so this is a rather unusual step for me. It feels like a good time though. My life is so different now than it was even one month ago.

If you'd like to continue stalking me, you can now find me over at <lj user=""ecclectic_gear"">. It's friends only, so make sure you leave a comment so I can add you back.

Thanks to all of my lj friends list for making lj such an enjoyable place for me to be."

"event","Wow! I'm out of home for nearly a week and I haven't died yet!

Internet is access only from the campus Library at this point, but we're looking into setting it up in our flat.

Paraphrasing the last few days.

Am living in a flat with Ishy (known to lj as medical_tophat) and 4 others. There's 3 guys and 3 gals, a lovely balance. So far no big hiccups, and everything's all peachy. We seem to be the unofficial party flat for the moment. Events include a communal painting of a really long canvas, freezing a toy dog, and frozen toy dog soccer. We also had a long battle getting the VCR to work, getting TV to work and has a playstation stolen.

We get to use a swipe card to enter the design building, which is made of concrete and is both the ugliest and safest building in the country. Filled with beautiful computers. Most of the kids in our class are from my old town, which is weird since I thought we'd be way more spead out rather than from the same place.

My computer is home, but I've lost EVERYTHING. It's taking a lot of work to restore it to the settings I like. It feels like meeting a person you were really fond of and they've gotten amnesia and can't remember you, or even themselves. I do have an extra 10 gigs or so of space on my HD now, which is shiny.


I'm having a seriously awesome time.

I don't have time to even glance at my friends page. I hope you guys are all still alive and ticking, and that I can give you some attention within the next week or two."

I bought The Dresden Dolls CD, so that's keeping me marvelous company at the moment. 

I'm really itching to do CG work and comic pages, but that seems as posible as me being allowed to fly to Japan this afternoon. (being not very)

I guess in a way this is nearly a goodbye. I don't know if I'll have any net access outside of what's provided on campus. I'm still really numb to all of these happenings. I guess it'll only be real when I see my family leave me on Wednesday."

I really really hope it's the kind of thing that can be fixed, and data can be restored. I can't afford to have to wipe all my data, I've lost a lot of software disks.

Fortunately I have done a giant back up, so all my Toolshed files are safe.

I'll be ringing up computer experts tomorrow. Hopefully it won't take very long to fix since I'm leaving town on Wednesday and I'd really like to take my computer with me.

So frustrating. I can't scan or work on any digital art whatsoever, since this computer doesn't have any of my programmes, or even my scanning software! Sucks a lot too, since I've got some really good ideas I want to work on.

"event","Turns out I've had womanly reasons for being in such a foul mood as of late. I really wish it didn't have to happen this week before moving, but eh, can't mess with nature.

So the packing up's officially starting. I took my pictures down off the walls and put them in boxes. Then I sorted through some of my papers and put them in boxes. Then I put my games and DVDs into a box. Then I took my books off my bookshelf, shooed the cat out of a box and put them in it. 

I've got half filled boxes of stuff and piles of other stuff still around my room. And a bunch of dolls and figurines. And paper, so much paper! And lots of other little ends of things, parts of stuff, and little puddles of collections that have just been stewing in dust for two years. I wonder if I vow to be more organized if it will make a difference. 

I still don't understand what it means to be moving out of my family's house and away from my family. Let alone that it'll all be done and dusted by this time next week. I'm going to miss them more than I can push my cluttered mind to imagine.

I'm wondering what I should do about my little community <lj user=""rivet_tool"">. People don't seem to want to join it. And as an updates journal it never got over 40 friends, people always adding it and then leaving. I might turn it back into an art, sketch and updates journal, since this journal's going to phase into becoming friends only over the next few days. I'm not going to lock all previous posts, but all new ones are going to be friends only."

I did accidentally delete ALL the PSDs of my Private Exchange CGs, thinking I'd already burnt the CD. They're all gone forever now, all I've got is the low-res finished versions and perhaps a sketch on paper somewhere. Oh well, at least they were all fan arts of other people's characters, nothing I would sell prints of. Even though I wasn't going to print from them, it's still sad to loose the original big files. It is like losing the original painting.

I did lose my Snowdrop CGs as well, which I'm sad about, since I actually quite enjoy working with her.

I'm going to have to trim down my 6GB iTunes library. I've got iTunes more or less always running, and I think the bigness of the library is making other programs lag. I don't have any proof of this, but that's how it feels.

Persephone playing with a pomegranate

I was watching Disney's Hercules movie last week, or the one before. And I was sitting there for a while before I realised ""Waitasecond... I used to <em>really </em>like Greek mythology!"" I don't know quite why I stopped. I think I read all the books we had, and then... something something pokemon. Oh well, I'm kindof pleased I've unearthed it, it was like some kind of sleeping treasure. I'm going to barstardise at least one Greek myth in my artistic lifetime.

I had a dream about forgetting most of my stuff when I move (like laptop, DVDs, games and paper, you know the important things). Then I got trapped in a maze of death escalators made up like some insane platform game. Then, after escaping the maze by diligently clinging to the handrail, what little luggage I did bring got sucked down the back of the escalators and mulched up into shreds. I'm welcome to any interpretations."

All in all, I've added probably near 100 new songs today. The Flaming lips, Crowded House, U2, John Butler Trio, Placebo and Queens of the Stoneage are among the newest of arrivals to my loverly iTunes music library.

A name that SHOULD be on there, but is sadly not, is Gershwin. That was one of the CDs I bought today. I paid MONEY for it, but I can't listen to it alongside every other CD I own because it has a big fat copy protect on it. My computer wouldn't even recognise that I put a CD in it. And then the bloody thing wouldn't eject, and I had to restart 3 times, all the times not managing to get past the ominous grey screen of doom. I think it may have injured something inside my computer, but I'm not sure yet.

I'm really annoyed because I'd really like to listen to the songs and have them shuffled among my everyday listening, but that's more or less impossible, since I'll have to play them separate to everything else. I'll probably never listen to it at all.

I would just stick it to them and download the songs, but the thing is, it's tough to find them. The only version of Summertime I have is sung by Fantasia.

Went kite-flying on friday with my little brother, was inspired to (digitally)paint this. I would have painted him in it too, but it was more like we were fighting over the kite than sharing it, so he didn't make it into the sketch, or into the finished thing.

I was going to read over all the entries on my friend's list and check off all the posts in forums I follow as well as all my messages on Devart, but it's really far too much for me to keep track of, so I'm just going to leave it.

I missed Cging more than I missed the net though. I got a lot of really great ideas for colouring while I was away, and most of them have been forgotten now since I didn't have a way to experiment with colour. But oh well, I'm back now and can do all the experimenting I like.

 I watched The Incredibles three times in the first three days of its release here. I didn't plan to, it's just different members of my family seemed to be going at different times, and I just happened to also be there. And hey, a free ticket to a good movie is not something to be turned down!

And of course, obligatory fan art. I'm planning to polish it up so it's all nice and finished looking, but I like how the flat colours look, so I thought I'd post it like this.

And another pic I'm working on. I'm trying to use more brushes than just the Gouache brush. I like how her hair's come up in this one.

And I should be able to get back into updating Toolshed as well, which will be a good thing.

I'm glad 2005 has started. I've finished high school for good and am about to get into the part of the education I'm actually looking forward to. 2004 was a very tedious year for me, 7th form wasn't as fun as everyone seemed to be telling me it was going to be."

Went to see Team America with Dad, twas good to have a good laugh.

Is it sad that I'm looking forward to seeing The Incredibles on boxing day more than I am about Christmas?"

"event","Went to see <em>Series of Unfortunate Events</em>. All together a visually delicious movie. It has the most beautiful end credits I've ever seen. I sat in the theatre all by myself and watched the whole thing. I got weird looks from the cleaning staff. 

 Next on my movie list; Team America, The Incredibles (bah, boxing day! curse New Zealand!), and Sky Captain, which has been pushed back yet again to Jan 3rd. 

Why must they release everything I want to see at once?

I've been awake since 2pm yesterday afternoon, so that's about... 26 hours now. I feel like my brain's melted a little and someone's been trying to use it as butter."

"event","One of my favourite online haunts since the dawn of my net-life has just died. It's been unwell for a while, but the word was said today and its death was made painfully clear. Still, out of the ashes rises not a phoenix, but a new forum run by ME!

Be afraid...

Anyways, <a href=""http://www.kaonashi.org"">The Kaonashi Forums</a> has been born! It's still massively under construction, and at some point I'll probably rip down the nice blue and white colour scheme in favour of one more fitting to me.

It's primarily an art forum, but I'm thinking of adding more sections. If this seems like your kinda thing, please join and make a bit of noise!

Also, if you can think of a better title, please suggest one!"

Loreli and Zane belong to <a href=""http://Loreli-angelofdeath.deviantart.com/"">Loreli</a> Done today in the spur of the moment. I broke my Lj-oath that I would not take on anymore fanarts until I was done with this lot. Eh, can't change it now. And I quite like how this one came out. Look, there's more than one person in the picture, and they're touching! Skills +1!

I need to stop with all the fanart, my poor characters are getting neglected. Well, no, they're not. I'm updating a comic page every weekday. But they're whining for full CGs of themselves for new bios. Two each, plus a cute little pixel icon. Oh, and they want character design sheets and more in-depth bios. And bigger caravans.

...and that's enough talking about my characters like they're people for today. Time for some rambling!

I find fanart really easy to work on. I like being able to adapt someone else's characters and ideas into my style. I love working on my own designs too, but I find it quite inspiring to work from someone else's characters.  This is probably untrue most of the time and I'm just in a really fanarty place right now. My fanart section was dry as anything before I joined PE, and now I'm shooting them off a mile a minute. Course I think my whole art metabolism has sped up as a result. So it's like these fanarts have extended my own work more than they have hindered it by speeding up my rate of pictures. I guess in the end it balances out. 

I still love my own characters more than I love other peoples. It'd be weird if I didn't. That'd be kindof like loving someone else's kids more than your own.

And my tablet has been ordered! Sometime soon I shall have my very own intuos 6x8 to fiddle with. Well, not so much fiddle with as ROCK OUT!!! ...with.

Yes, it's 2 in the morning, and yes, I have been making a conscious effort to try and fix my horrible sleeping/eating patterns. I did manage to make it up before midday two days in a row. I'm still trying to convince myself i should be having more than just coffee for lunch, but it's not happening. I should go to bed now so that I am able to wake before midday again today, but I'm just not that sleepy right now."

Done for <a href=""http://www.mysky.net/art/"">Sae</a> in the Holiday exchange round at Private Exchange. I'm really pleased with how it came up, especially considering that I've never been in a snowball fight, or even around that much snow. But I imagine it follows the same principals as a water fight, only the water is frozen.

I'm glad to be going into summer now. We've had a whole bunch of crappy weather and dammit, we deserve this sunshine. I hear rumours this summer is going to be a mild one, and that makes me sad. I want it to be so hot I can barely move to turn on the fan. Course, I might get it, and then i'll be wishing for the cold so that I can wrap myself up in a mountain of blankets with a hot chocolate, a cat and a book. My iBook, that is!

Sylvie and Andy need to stop being so damn cute together so I can get back to drawing relevant pages of Toolshed. No one (apart from me) cares about what went on with Rivet's parents back in the day.

And now it is time to stop writing in the LJ and go do some arting."

"event","Man, I haven't posted in a while. Mostly because I've been doing bucketloads of nothing balanced out with some handfuls of nothing, complimented by long, endless stretches of, yep, you guessed it, nothing.

Well, that's a lie. But nothing interesting enough to write about.

But I'm gonna write about it anyways!

I did go with Jake the video shop and rented a whole bunch of animated movies. I'm lucky to have a younger brother to use as an excuse to rent out kids movies. But then again, I do it without him too. Because it's the best section of the store. The Selection this time was Road to El Dorado, Osmosis Jones, Treasure Planet, Monsters inc, and Bionicle (a.k.a Two hour advertisement for Lego). I enjoyed all of them, bar the Lego ad. I probably would have liked it more had I bothered to pay attention, but probably not.

I haven't posted any art because I'm working on about 10+ projects right now (plus comic), and I don't feel like posting in-progress pictures of what I'm doing.


My sleeping pattern/eating pattern are screwed beyond repair. But there is no place for me to be so it really doesn't matter to anyone if I sleep til 3pm and stay up until 6am. I'm trying to eat more than just dinner and coffee, but that's not going too well either. And again with the not mattering to anyone whether I'm healthy or not. Well, it probably matters to my Mother, but I don't tell her.

I've got a hugely large amount of projects on my plate right now, and I'm still signing myself up for more. I'm making a vow here, in this LJ entry not to take any more projects on board until I've finished a decent number of the current ones.

...Unless they are paid, or really really <em>really</em> cool.

Went on an anatomy book hunt At the library today, also hoping to find a book on Leonardo Da Vinci's sketches. I did manage to find really good versions of both. Unfortunately they were in the book store and not in the Library. And I aint paying $90 for an anatomy book, no matter how good (mostly because I don't have $90). The Da Vinci sketchbook was of his machines, which was what I wanted, I'd like to incorporate some of those ideas into my machine design for Toolshed. Seeing as right now, they are teh SUCK.

Been doing guy practice, but nothing really worth developing, or even scanning. I'm seeing a slight improvement, so let's hope that continues enough to show a marginal improvement. And that that shall continue to an actual improvement. 

Heh, nothing turns out to take up a little more space than expected."

And instead of thinking about the closing of a chapter and the starting of a new (and better!) phase of my life, all I can think is that I have NOTHING to do for 10 weeks.

So there I was, was I, sitting there at my computer desk, minding my own business when all of a sudden a gust of wind blew open my door! And what came through that door was a giant moth! We're talking Mothra's Great-great-great-great-great- grandnephew... But anyways, it was still the biggest moth I'd seen that day. What it lacked in size it made up for in ferociousness. It flew directly at me, flapping around and being a disgusting mothy moth all in my face. Later scientists determined the cause of this was the strong light I keep next to my desk in order to slow down the blinding properties of staring at a tiny screen all day. But that I didn't know at the time, and so to me the moth remains a crazy thing flitting around in my face, hell bent on scaring me into the next life. On instinct, I removed myself from my chair and relocated over the other end of the room. I lost sight of the moth, unsure of exactly where it was hiding, unsure of whether it was gearing for a second attack...

The Enzo, my darling beautiful cat Enzo... He leaps up from his pretend slumber in order to proctect me, and he POUNCED on the godforsaken moth, saving his darling mistress from almost certain harassment!

He then ate the moth, which was kinda gross, but at least it was gone.

This picture was inspired by these events. It is to commemorate my darling Enzo and I's friendship. And while I have utilised my artistic licence, it's really hardly noticible..."

"event","I had another little art depression moment yesterday/today. I'm over it now, but I've decided I'm going to get off of my but and do something about it. No one else wants my time, so I might as well use it to get better at what I suck at.

Number one thing that needs improving... males. I draw shockingly bad boys. It's like looking back at my style three years ago. I just can't seem to draw a non-sucky guy. And Jack doesn't count because most of the time he's too girly for his own good.

I don't know why I find them hard, I don't even know what I'm doing wrong. It's like the lines go in all the wrong places.

But enough of the suck. I've already been through all of that and am now determined to fix this big fat hole in my skills. I'm going to go and get out an anatomy drawing book for ze library sometime in the next week so I'm building my skills up from kinda-sorta realism rather than bits and bobs of other people's styles. This will also hopefully help me to iron out some other proportion issues I'm having. A better answer would be access to a lifedrawing class or a model of some kind, but since I don't have either, I shall settle for art books from ze library. 

But the Library has to wait until I can get into town, and I want to start improving NOW, dammit, so I did some sketching to warm up the old thinker to the idea.

It's for my cousin who recently had a baby. I haven't spoken to her in a while since she currently lives in Myanmar, and it's pretty hard to contact her, and then get responses.

I got new icons!  *glee* They are from the wonderful folks of Private Exchange. We're doing icon exchanges at the moment. I got the better deal, since these icons are great and mine are ass.

I haven't been contacted by the juice bar people yet. Luckily the same girl who I gave my application to was working today and filled me in on the situation. Which is that they've been too busy to interview, but shall do it soon-ish. And that I should be bubbly when they interview me.

I wish I could remember more of my dreams. I'm so sure a lot of interesting stuff happens in them, but I just can't remember what. I vaguely recall bits and pieces, but all I remember when I wake up is that I was deathly paranoid about spider attacks. Maybe it's because I'm too tired when I go to sleep, so I'm too tired to remember what I'm dreaming. But that sounds even more stupid typed out than it does in my head..."

The Eraser end of the stylus doesn't work, the plastic where the stylus touches looks like it's being eaten at by some mystery chemical, a big roundy metal thing broke inside the mouse, and I had to unscrew it to get it out so it wouldn't damage anything inside (turned out to just be a weight). The nib has be ground to a slanty point, getting increasingly shorter and shorter as time progresses. 
Despite all of the crap I put this thing through, it's still functioning, no matter at not 100%

I am promised a replacement, which is very nice of my parents. I've heard tell of an <em>intuos</em>, the next quality and size up from my little graphire 2. So, it's just going to take a little patience on my part, I'm sure my tablet can last until then... whenever that is.

<a href=""http://img127.exs.cx/img127/3483/estwingpic.jpg"">Estwing</a> is slowly taking over Toolshed. He 3-page cameo has stretched to 6 pages. And I keep thinking of more fun ways to put her into it. I like Estwing a lot, her relationship with Jack is similar to the one I've got with my little bother, I mean, brother.

I'm playing FF8 again. Back about a year ago I restarted 8, even bought a new copy since I mysteriously lost disk 3 and disk two had a big fat scratch on it that was so bad I had to borrow someone else's disk to get past the damage. But then my playstation mysteriously exploded (there's always a lot of mystery surrounding things I share with my brothers...) and playstation2 came along! I could finally play FFX, so 8 was left a little forgotten. Until now!!!
...That was more than anyone sane wanted to know about me and FF8, but I said it anyway!

And yay for British comedy! Dad brought home <em>A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</em> on DVD. We might not have much in common, but we like the same kinda shows (good ones)."

"event","I've applied for a job at a juice bar, so hopefully that will come through, since I've got a lot of free time and nothing to do but draw, which tends to lead to crazy. I don't mind a bit of insanity, but I would like a something to ward off the deep-crazy (a la earlier this week). Plus, money! I'm so totally broke right now, I don't even have 50 cents for library fees. Hopefully I'll manage not to spend it all at EB games, which is on the other side of the foodcourt...

<lj user=""pepper_maid"">: Sometimes its cool. depends on who you are as an artist.
me: Yeah, I guess
<lj user=""pepper_maid"">: Its like sexual harassment.  If jo shom from down the raod slapped up on the ass you'd be hella pissed. If Johnny Depp did it you'd giggle non-stop for 40 days
me: True
<lj user=""pepper_maid"">: if jo shom puts a tail on some one its ""ewww"" if Amono puts a tail on someone its ""woooow""
me: amano can do whatever the hell he likes, I'm pretty sure normal laws don't apply to him.

"event","I want to say thanks to all of you who commented on my last entry. It did really cheer me up when I woke up to find these lovely comments in my journal. And thanks to anyone else who took the time to even click behind the cut.

I'm feeling much better now, and am coming to terms with the whole ""popularity with my comic"" thing. I don't give a crap about popularity in a school situation, so I don't know why I care so much when it's online. Oh well, I'll just try not to think too hard about it and just enjoy my comic.

I've gotten over the hump of the bit of comic I didn't like. My plans for the rest of the chapter are rather fun, and I'm looking forward to them finished. Chapter 2 seems good when I run through it in my head, so hopefully it will sound and look good when I'm up to them.

Anyway, I did a sketchy today which I'll post.

"event","My English exam is now a bip in the distant past. I never have to sit another one of those again! And I think I did quite well considering I didn't do a lick of study.  Still, I doubt I'll be forgetting <em>The Crucible</em> anytime in the next 50 years. The results shall dictate to what degree of well I did. as long as it's got a pass involved somewhere in it, I'll be happy.

<lj-cut text=""I'm gonna sweep this under a cut, getting artsy-angsty"">
I posted some banners over at <lj user=""rivet_tool""> for my little webcomic. I'm getting about 45 visits a day to my little comic, which I guess is pretty good, I don't know. My website gets about 70 visits a day and it's been up for a year and a half. 

Then again, I've never promoted my website at all, and my comic I've been at least attempting to plug it in some communities around LJ and other online forum-ish places. Doesn't really seem to be making much progress, especially not in the stats department. And even less in actual response from people.  It's making me really quite sad that my comic isn't moving anywhere, and that no one's really saying anything about it. I'm not fishing for comments or bullying anyone into commenting more on my works (though t'would be nice), just feeling a little sad that I put such a huge creative gamble of mine out there and all I hear back is crickets.

As much as I know it isn't true, I still think numbers equal good, and more numbers/more attention, especially in art, always means you're better (with the exception of Gaia online, I know that's bullshit). It's not how I consciously think I function, but I'm so totally dominated by these numbers and their effects on my comic in particular.

Then I start thinking that because my comic isn't popular, that it must be crass and heinous, and those who do say they like it are indeed just humouring me so I'll shut up for a while and go off to live in my little bubble of happy for a few more minutes. Most of the time I know this is just my mind and its oh-so-lovely self destructive nature I spent a lot of time with when I was 15. But dammit I'm <em>eighteen</em> now, the teenage angst should be more or less dissipated by now. Deep down I know that my work is worth more than shit. I don't have this giant fucking callous on my finger from writing notes for English.

I don't want to change what I do in my comic just to make it popular, but it's the only thing I think about when I'm working on a page, and the work ends up feeling like just that, work. I get a giant ball of anxiety and stress, rather than the enjoyment it was back a couple of months ago. I could always take down the stupid little number banners and just drop out of the race altogether. It still wouldn't really change that my comic isn't getting as many hits as I would like.

All in all, I feel quite bitter when I look at my comic. I can't decide if I love it to bits, or hate it to death. It's really tearing me up to have these kinds of feelings over this comic. I love the characters and the storyline, but there's something about the way it's being executed that makes me want to cry, and I never want to cry. If this keeps up, I might just remove it from the internet altogether, and draw it just for me.

I doubt these feelings will keep up though. It's 2a.m. in the morning, and I'm sure putting a night's sleep between me and this rant will clear up the majority of the issue. I'm sleep deprived and living on a very bad diet of lotsa nothing and little dinner. Throw a little PMS into the mixture and it's a surprise I haven't killed anyone. 

Well, here's hoping I feel better tomorrow.

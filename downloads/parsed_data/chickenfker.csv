"event","So, where did I leave off?  Yeah, I don't know either.  Doesn't matter.  Much has happened.

Today is Halloween.  My favorate of holidays and a good month in general.

Most things are still really good.  I'm getting to New York about once a month.  Last Sunday I auditioned at Carnegie Hall (hahahahahahahahaha.  YES!).  I didn't get it, but they told me to come sing for them again next year, so it was progress.  I've also auditioned for the Japanese tour or Rent, and a couple of other things. 

I just wrapped a really awesome gig for Yorktown day, and today I was working at Stage Company, also nice.

Something is off, though.  I don't know what, but I feel...detached.  I don't know.  I feel like I've been gradually losing all of my strong connections with people.  I feel strangely isolated, and I do not like it, not one bit.

On the plus side, things with Kris are going really well.  We just celebrated out 6 month anniversary, and I still get giddy when my thoughts drift to her.  Which they are wont to do.

She came down to see me, for my birthday.  Big surprise.  She just showed up at my door and we spent the entire weekend together.  Then she got me a cake.  Then she got my flowers.  

This last time up, I got to see her show, and it was really cute.

I think the most telling thing about our relationship was after my audition at Carnegie.  I knew logically that I had done really well, but you still get that slightly dejected feeling whenever you don't make a cut.  She...understood.  Without even having to say a word, she looked into my eyes and made me feel whole again.

...I love her so...


Okay, NY friends, I will be up again soon (Probably in November here, somewhere, my evenings look surprisingly open right now), so keep an ear out for me, because I may come a callin'.

I realize that the major points of this update have been summarized as trivialities, but there's too much to write about, and for me, not enough time.  Not right now.  If you want a really good update...give me a call.  No, seriously, give me a call.  I would love to hear from you.

LOVE!"

"event","I'm not gonna give some speech about how I never update, because we all know I never do.  Anyway, let's talk about life, shall we?

1. If you're gonna come to my show, you should do so by the 19th...because that is Kris' farewell performance.  And if you haven't met her yet, she is much with the fantabulousness.

2. I'm doing a reading for a musical in Richmond this month.  That'll be my second reading this summer and my third overall gig.  I would say I've been quite productive.  I know I don't update much, but it's on the 18th, and I promise to write details before it happens.

3. I have now seen Illyria and Cats.  Both were...potentially terrible shows that were well staged, and well performed.  I did miss, however, Shirley Thompson's acting debut in Arsenic and Old Lace.  Of this, I am quite regretful.

4. My girlfriend (have I mentioned where she is amazing?  Yes?  Well, she still is)...is gonna be in a video game.  It's a virtual reality game that she will be hosting.  Live acting gig, but she is in a separate blue screen room.  My inner nerd is incredibly turned on.  And, of course, I'll be going to see it, so if you want to come, just say so.

5. 5 is skipped for technical reasons.

6. Kim is back from Italy.  I realize that I never posted that she had left for Italy...but she is back.  And it went very well.  If you haven't heard her sing...you've missed out.  If you have heard her sing, and think she is amazing...well...some major names in the industry agree with you.  I'm sure she'll update details, and I don't want to steal her thunder, but you should totally ask her about it, if you see her.

7. Semi-progress on new monologues.  A good lead for some new headshots.  I need to make a serious audition run.  My show ends in September, and I intend to carry my momentum beyond it, so there.

And that, my dear friends, is that.  No promises about updating.  You know I won't keep them.  Love and kittens for now.

"event","Gosh I'm lazy.  Okay, so...life.

First of all, my show has started again.  If you can come this summer, you totally should.  www.pptva.com for info.  It's short, and cute, and I sing a lot in it.  But you should come anyway.

Also...for those of you not in the loop on this one...I may kind of be dating my castmate.  Which, of course, is a bit of a no-no.  But...for this one, I don't care.  Her name is Kris, and we've been dating casually for 2 months now, and...I really kind of like her.  Which is unfortunate, because she is leaving for NYU in the fall.  (Those of you who already know, or who check the website, may be inclined to point out that she is really young.  And, well, yes, she is.  But we click really well.  We think the same, and frequently say the same thing at the same time.  And when we do, my heart has taken to jumping a beat.  We're very good for each other, and she's on my mind more than I should probably admit.)  But, she is leaving, so I'm not trying to force anything right now.  I think there is alot of potential between us, but I don't want either of us to end with heartache.  

This whole thing happened really fast, and really unexpectedly.  I did an increasingly shitty job of ignoring it for weeks.  Then, finally, we had our last performance before our break.  Afterwards, the cast and crew all went to dinner, and then some of us milled around trying to decide what to do.  Nicha had her heart set on karaoke, but we couldn't find a place that would let us all in.  So, we're standing next to the Kimball, and the girls all had to pee.  So, Todd (our sound guy) busts us into the theatre, and then he busts out some mics, and speakers, and plugs his CD player into the stage, and (since it was after midnight) busts some beer out of concessions.  In short, he fucking rules.  So, we drank (well, Kris and I didn't, but everyone else did) and sang, and had a merry time.  After a few hours, people began to depart, and it wound up being me, Kris, Todd, and one of our grips, Jon.  Kris kept commenting on how pretty it was out, and she went to take a walk.  When I followed to check on her, I found her waiting for me around the corner.  So, we walked around Williamsburg, hand-in-hand (because, well, we had been hand-in-hand for the most part for the previous 2 weeks).  It was gorgeous out.  The rain had recently fallen, but it was cool, and airy, and the water made everything glisten in the moonlight.  We turned away from William & Mary, and avoid the hooligans running around, until we got to a quiet part of Duke of Gloucester St.  There was a couple jogging behind us, and as they passed, we were walking under a tree.  We both just stopped, turned into each other, and began to kiss.  It was disgustingly romantic.  Since that night, we have spent as much time as possible in each other's arms.  And I regret nothing.

Let's see, what else.  I've done a lot of traveling lately.  New York, Charlotsville, Richmond (Kris lives in Richmond), Petersburg, Short Pump.  My little hoopty is tired from all that work.  But I don't know if I want to replace it yet.

I'm making a ton of money this summer, so that's not an issue, but...I don't want to be here anymore.  I just feel so done, and so dead.  I look to Lauren making her escape, and I feel I should do something similar, and soon.  So, end of the summer, I'm going to New York for an audition run, and if I don't get anything...I do it again.  And again.  I have to leave, and I can't afford to get trapped.  So, no reason to buy a car if I'm not going to drive it.

So...things are really good right now.  We'll see where the summer takes me, but I feel more alive right now than I have in a long time.  And I intend to push that while I can.


Come see my show.

And...I love you all dearly."

"event","I've been characteristically quiet lately, so I guess I should just jump right in, huh?

Sooooooooooo, NY.  Aids Walk 2006.  Yes, I know, I should have used this forum to request donations, but I didn't.  Because I am a lazy ass.  Moving on.

Team Supersnack has been up to it's old tricks in spite of my lackluster efforts.  We raised over 20k this time, and I still had a good hand in it.  The team was much larger this year (40) and included 5 Mikes (though Mullin was a no show.  Raymond, Bland, Derby, and myself took a picture flipping him off).

Day One:  Kim and I left early...ish and picked up Derby in Richmond.  We cruised all the way to DC, and then we sat in traffic until we were in NY.  It was unpleasant, somewhat amplified by the fact that I was still VERY sore after an adventurous night out with Kristen.  (Hmmm...Kristen...I haven't discussed Kristen yet in a non-cryptic manner, have I?  Uhuh.  Well...I'll have to rectify that.  Sometime soon.)  Pain would be a running theme for the weekend.  The three of us were staying at Sarah's apt, so we went there, unpacked, and made for the cabaret, to which we were only MOSTLY late.  But we still got to see Caryn, Rian, and Denise perform, along with a fairly humorous comedian.  After that, we played ""Let's Drink!"", which we all turned out to pretty good at.  The old school peeps were many.  Aside from the above mentioned, we had Lauren, Angela, Zach, Allen, Greg, Adam, Allison, Amanda Gagnon, Steph Shipp, Fred, and Cash representing the CNU crew.  There were lots of other people there, too.  Anyway...we got drunk.  And then made the long journey back to Sarah's (with Adam and Mike Bland), Kim and I arguing the whole way.  I'm pretty sure everyone else got sick of that.  (Side note: why do the trains in NY become such a pain in the balls after midnight?  You have to wait like, half an hour to catch one, and they move at a snail's pace.  I have been out late (and drunk) in a number of cities, and NY's trains are the only ones that are that retarded.)

Day Two:  We got up late and worked our way into the city.  Checked out the new Apple store, but didn't go in.  Then we hit the park, climbed a big-ass rock, and went to sleep.  That was nice, considering the previous night's activities.  A couple of hours later, Angela's crew made it in, too.  Greg had brought practice blades, so we starting fighting.  I...was rusty.  VERY rusty.  Allen tore me up, Adam fought me to a draw (and I've never lost to Adam, so that was still hard to take), and Cash...well, all I can do with Cash is apologize for the huge bruise I gave him.  Somewhere in there I sprained the hell out of my foot.  Adam didn't help it any when he nailed me in the ankle on what was, I must confess, an excellent attack.  After sword time, we switched to Red Rover, which is how Denise hurt her wrist (we play hard).  Other highlights included: Adam and Allen reenacting Mr Peepers, Pigs in a Blanket, Spontaneous Wrestling, Impromptu Softball, 15 Minute Hamlet (I missed that one), some jam sessions and general fun times.  I think we all knew how fleeting our time together was, and we all just sort of fell back into our old dynamics.  It was nice...even though there wasn't enough time to connect with everyone.  Kim, Mike Raymond and I made a departure to get tickets to, as it turned out, Doubt.  On the way...I heard someone call my name, and I turned around and found myself face-to-face with Justin Street, a friend of mine from Hamlet last summer.  He and his wife were waiting in the Wicked lottery.  I haven't seem him in almost a year, and we run into each other in Times Square.  Crazy.  But, stuff like that has been happening alot lately, so, hey.  Doubt turned out to be really good, in spite of Jena Malone.  The script was solid, and the rest of the cast quite good.  I'd go into greater detail, but this show really deserves it's own entry.  Meaning...it probably won't get one.  So, we went back to Angela's to party hardy for a bit, then Kim and I crashed at Sarah's.  Which brings us to:

Day Three:  The Walk:  Angela told us to meet up in Central Park at 8:30...so I should have known to expect her at 9:30.  But I didn't.  So, oh well.  We met up with the rest of the team, took pictures, made signs, met a lovely girl named Beth and assigned her to be the fifth Mike (that worked out well), and walked.  The group stayed together better this year, but by the end we were still fewer.  The walked actually seemed easier, for some reason, but by the end of it my sprained foot was PISSED OFF.  I mean, we were all in pain, as last year, but I had already spent the entire weekend hurting and it got much worse when we finished.  Anyway...we (Kim, Derby, Me) decided that we had a long drive back and started the return trek.  That was at 2.  Accident on the LIE.  Subway series at Shea.  One wrong turn.  We got out of NY at around 8, and with a new map.  We didn't even get back to Kim's until 4 fucking 30 in the goddamn morning.  Kim told me not to come to work the next day, and I actually took her up on it.  

Monday, I simply rested.  Yeah.  'Cuz I needed it.  I'm still somewhat hobbled, but that's going away.  Oh, and I just found out I may get tonsillitis, which isn't pleasant, but I can deal with.  In this case, if I do catch it...it was worth catching.

Okay, it's late and I'm tired.  But at least I made myself do a real update, and that may inspire me to do more soon.

Unlikely, but still.

Love."

Okay, so, there's more to that, but that was the specific comment that caught my attention.  And it got me to thinking.  See, I know that I can come across a bit strong, but I also tend to think of myself as charming.  Obviously, this perception is not shared with the entirety of the world.  So my question is, what did you think of me when you met me?  Did I scare you?  Annoy you?  Or did you like me?  (those who felt general ambivalence don't have to do anything)  Just tell me.  'Cuz right now, I'm all self-conscious about first impressions, and I don't need to be.

Thanks.

Anyway, things are pretty good (I wouldn't have said that last week, last week was a disaster).  I mean, I'm busy and all, but it's the kind of busy I like, even though I don't have time to hang out with anyone.  But work has actually lightened up, and it's baseball season again, so double yay there.

And, I just found out (Just now...what?  You don't believe me?  Why not?  I'm so sincere.  I make Mother Teresa look like Gandhi...oh, wait...) that Mel Brooks is making Young Frankenstein into a Broadway musical.  I'm taking bets he does Silent Movie after that.  Can you imagine?  Silent Movie, the Musical...a bunch of actors dancing and mouthing nothing.

I am a veritable cornucopia of colors.  Well, okay, mostly black and blue, with a little red thrown in (carpet burn) for good measure.  The only time I have done a show with more prat falls was 15 Minute Hamlet, in which I had six death scenes.  And you want to know what's really interesting?  Opening your e-mail everyday to find out how many script changes there have been.  See, they write their own shows, and they keep having ideas, so the script keeps changing.  And the music...well...we weren't given sheet music, but rather, CDs to listen too.  That's been interesting.  We've had a little bit of studio time, (Including a recording session, the second show I've done recordings for, how exciting) and then we pretty much catch as catch can.  It's been hard.

Speaking of work, I should go to it.  I solemnly promise to update about our first run next week.  I'll be a little busy with a reading project for Steven (it's just me, him, Erin, and half of TheatreCNU), but I have almost half my nights next week free, so I should be rested.

"event","So, for those you of you who don't remember, or those of you who never knew, I was in New York for the big blizzard of 05.  It came down really hard, and finished with about 17 inches, most of which was, I believe, centered on and around Kimmy's car.  It was at the time the most snow I had ever seen.

Now, for anyone who has followed the weather channel lately, guess where I am?

Go ahead, guess.

I am in New York.  Not only am I in New York, but I am staying with Sarah and Dave in the exact same apartment I was staying in when the blizzard of 05 hit.  In fact, I don't know that I've ever been here without snow, but DAMN it's a lot of snow.  I never got a final estimation for Queens (where I am), but apparently Central Park recorded over 26 inches.  I will say this though, the city really handles it's snow well.

This one was very different.  It never seemed to snow as hard as last year's, but it fell for a long time.  It started off with the same consistency as the last blizzard (dry and flaky), but today was fairly warm, so it's melted down and turned into decent packing snow (this stuff ain't going away soon, let me tell you).  

I'm kind of glad, because this forced me to come online and tell everyone.  I haven't been updating much, even though I have a great deal to say.  There are many things going on right now that I should talk about, but I've been a bit down lately, and I haven't had the energy to put it all down.  I really want something big to work out soon, and it very well may(opportunities abound), but I've also been scared and depressed, and a full gambit of other emotions that find themselves vying for dominance over me.

That's actually another reason I'm glad to be here.  Even if some of my auditions here don't work out, I've managed to get away for a bit and clear my stupid head.  The routines have been killing me, and I already feel better about myself.  But I digress.  I'll be here until Wednesday, so I'll probably have more to say on the subject soon, but for now, if you live in New York and ever want snow, maybe you should invite me to come stay at Sarah and Dave's apartment."

"event","So, I have this gig for Stage Company in Norfolk on Friday mornings, right?  Found out last Thursday that President Bush would be speaking in Norfolk the following morning.  According to the news (and everyone I spoke to) the President was flying in to Norfolk International, and they were essentially shutting down Norfolk from 9-12.  So I, being a person of reasonable intelligence, left my house at 8 (in the FREAKING morning) and took 664, which would steer me clear of the airport.  At 8:40, I hit Norfolk...and then came to a complete stop.  I arrived at my destination at 9:45!  WTF!!!!  Someone's watch must have been fast.

So, I finally arrive, get out of my car and set up.  And wait.  And wait.  And then...wait.  Why?  Because of the 11 groups I was scheduled to perform for, approximately 0 showed up.  Why was that?  Read the previous paragraph.

Now, my costume is NOT exactly the most comfortable thing in the world, and I stood in it for a little over an hour waiting.  About the only good news is that I get paid regardless.  And since I was stuck in Norfolk I got to meet up with some old friends for lunch, because I wasn't trying to leave in that mess.

On the plus side, I got to pass Protester's Row, and saw a sign that said ""Someone please give him head so we can impeach him!""  Haha.

Also, don't forget to listen to Tommy & Rumble tomorrow morning.  Support the band, yo.

Once upon a time, Paul was the actor who came on stage and made you feel ""safe"".  He was a solid character actor you could rely on to support the show.  In the last year, however, he has gained an edge that turns ""safe"" into ""riveted"".  I wish he was reading this.  Someone get the man on LJ.  NOW.  

Danny has never owned a role before.  He's come close before, but here, he was in his element.  More comfortable and natural than I have ever seen him.  I wish he was reading this.  Unattentive bastard.

Stirling improved as the show progressed, probably because she raised her stakes VERY well.  And my mother thinks she looks like Alanis Morrisette with her hair wet.  Not sure how I feel about that one.

And Clair (Nicole?) was impressive.  I didn't mean to start a revue, I would have just felt bad if I left anyone out.

A friend of mine from Stage was adjudicating, I should pick his brain about it.  Also, it was really good to see him.  

Got some more toys (Inuyasha, Season 1, hotdamn!).  Then some sour news spoiled the day.  I can't go into it, but it isn't good.

I'm excited about the audition.  I have two more weeks to prepare, and I can't waste them.  Kind of have myself in a bind with my time, but what else is new?

Say...this is slightly off in left field, but who here knows anything about investing?  I've started some research, but I would love to talk to someone about all of it.  I guess I really should hang out with more Math and Accounting majors.  Proof makes them sound cool, how bad could it be?  It's not like I know anyone who does math puzzles for fun.  Umm...It's not like I know anyone other than Jack who does math puzzles for fun.  SHIT!  It's not like I know anyone other than Jack or Anthony who does math puzzles for fun.  Are we done?  I think we're done.  Peace out."

Things have been going really well lately.  Work has calmed down alot.  And I got an acting gig through VA Stage (I'm contracted out from them to a historical re-enactment gig.  I audition for them proper at the end of the month.).  Promise not to laugh, but I'm playing George Washington.  I actually turned it down a couple of times before a schedule worked out.  Neal (my director from Hamlet) is a stubborn fella.

Last night was really great, too.  I got to go out with the peeps, some old, some new.  Something I needed very badly.  I'm going to have to make a concentrated effort to spend more time with people.  There are good times to be had and relationships to explore.  Two things that are VERY important to me.

So I don't know why today has been so bad.  But I also don't have the energy left to cry about it anymore.  Nothing left to it but to look forward to tomorrow.  

Hell, this whole week could be excellent, if I let it.

My show has wrapped, with a paltry last weekend (.5 performances.  I never thought I would experience something like that.).  The cast was wonderful and I made some very good connections and, more importantly, some new friends.  I forgot how much I love this world, these people.  Artists who look at you, and understand where you are, because they are/were there too.  I'm going to miss my Southside peeps.

But, I had a kickass audition yesterday with potential callback in November.  Good-paying gig, too.

And I have another audition in September...this one in Tennessee, near my extended family.

I've been (gradually) making some big changes, now I'm just looking for the opportunities to enliven them.  If these don't work out, I'll be looking for something else.  I came to the conclusion the other day that this is my life.  I should be living it for me, not stuck trying to claw my way around.  I'll make mistakes, I'll have successes and failures, but ulitimately, I will do things for myself.  And so long as I'm doing that, I have no worries.

And, I think I'll be taking the I-pod plunge very soon here (hell, I just made a shit-load of money, what with all the overtime, plus my Hamlet paycheck all at once).  I'm to the point where I firmly believe that everyone should have an I-pod.  Unless they can't afford to eat, in which case they should have an I-pod and a sandwich.  I wonder if there's a charity out there for that.  The Salvation I-pod.  Or not.

Come and see the show, if you can.  Preferably starting next weekend.  Recommended: Lawn chairs or blanket, bug spray, cooooooooooool drinks - possibly in a cooooooooooler.

The other really great thing is that with the opening, I get more time.  M-W are no longer rehearsal nights.  Less driving, less work.  I needed this.

We agreed we should be friends.  And that we don't really want to just be friends.  But that's besides the point."

"event","<i>Prologue</i>
""What's this scar? It's scary.""
Eyebrow.  ""That's from my heart surgery when I was a kid.  I told you that.""
""No.  What was wrong?""
""I had a hole in my heart.""  So matter of fact.
Pause.  I giggle.
""What?""
""You had a hole in your heart before you met me.""

<i>Yesterday</i>
Inbox:  Captain Fall-Down, no subject.
I miss you.  I hope you're doing well.

Email being too personal, I get a card and a bottle of honey.  Clandestine doorstep drop-off.
Inside:  ""I miss you, too.  Plus I had this card that looked like a rooster, and this honey shaped like a bear, and I thought you might like that.""

Inbox:  Captain Fall-Down, no subject
""You're so sweet to a bastard.  I wish I had been here when you dropped the card and honey by.  It would have made my day to see your face...and also to hear some snippy remark about the hole in my heart.  You're too good to me sweets.""

But I won't reply."

Maybe I'm just getting old.  25 this Christmas!"

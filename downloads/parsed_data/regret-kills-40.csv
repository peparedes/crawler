"event","i seriously think that this weekend was used as a test of every aspect of my life: family, friends, and well somethin else.  i'll start with family.  the last week has realy tested my patience with my parents whether it be about gettin off groundation, about college, or about my new cell phone.  They havent left my with a minute of peace all week.  All i've been hearing is dont do anything stupid or wheres your transcripts or you shouldnt spend so much money on a stupid cell phone.  Let's just say i was about ready to snap, but i kept my cool.  I just dealt with all the shit and took it as it came.  Turns out i didnt do anythin stupid yet, i got all my transcripts, and somehow i tricked them into buying my phone.  Everythin turned out good, so hopefully next week they wont keep buggin me.  So i passed the family part of the test. Next is friends.  So last night was crazy.  Nick and cole got drunk and were pretty out of it.  Nick lost his mind, hit a wall (again), and broke his hand (again).  Next thing i kno hes ballin his eyes out worryin about everythin in his life.  Not only do i have to worry about him, but cole was falling and trippin over things almost breakin the entire house.  Kate was there but as much as i love kate, shes a ditz and was of no help.  So i talk to nick tell him that he shouldnt worry about money or what hes gonna tell his parents, and he needs to enjoy the rest of his night.  I tell him whats done is done and he needs to get what he set out to do.  He doesnt really take it in at first but after tellin him a couple of times, he finally gets it.  So him and shelly go into the tv room, he shoots a blank, and everythin is well.  So i pass the friends part of the test.  But after all this im not in the greatest of moods, which sorta brings me to the last test.  The last test had to do my relationship.  So im kinda in this relationship with this girl.  Its not a serious relationship, its laid back and there really isnt any restrictions.  And if theres any problems or what not we'll deal with them when they come up.  Its just what i need right now.  I've said it before and ill say it again, i just wanna have fun before college and this girl is all i need to do that.  So everything has been great, the relationship is laid back, but i still get to see her a lot.  But this weekend has tested my laid backness.  Everything was all good on friday, she came over, we chilled, had a good time, and it was cool.  I mean i was kinda all over her but she was the only one i wanted to talk to/ be with so i dont feel too bad about it.  Anyways though onto sat.  I'm thinkin now and i guess i really didnt call that much, but it just seemed like i slipped into that obsessively, annoying boyfriend that drove her away the first time.  I realy dont have a reason why i think this, but i do.  But i needed her last night.  Like i said earlier after all the drama, i was not in a good mood.  I even the let the happy balloons that me and cole bought fly away.  To be honest, i was blamin myself for everythin that happend that night, even though i knew i couldnt control it.  So im sittin on nanas back hood, thinkin about how much i screwed up.  I was the sober one, i shoulda been able to stop it.  This definitly doesnt fall into the category of me having fun before college. So she comes out, stands in front of me, and tells me that this wasnt my fault and stuff of that nature.  Then she kisses me on the cheek.  I kno your prob sayin to youreself, big deal a kiss on the cheek is nothin.  But to me this kiss meant the world to me.  To me, you can hook up with anyone just cause u want action, but when u kiss someone somewhere other than the lips, it means a little more.  It means you care about them.  I can picture you sittin at your laptop with this disgusted look thinkin that im takin everythin to seriously and im readin way too much into everythin, but hopefully ur sittin there with a slight smile on your face because maybe, just maybe you understand what im sayin and realize that i need you in a non-wanting-a-serious-relationship-type-of-way.  Anyways she made me realize that none of this was my fault and i should be inside having a good time with her after dealin with nick and all the other shit that was goin on.  So the rest of the night was highly entertainin and fun, and to think i would of missed it all if it wasnt for her.  To relate this to what i was sayin earlier, i used to get mad a lot when i was that obsessive, annoying bf.  So i dont think i passed the relationship part of the test, but im not sure i failed it either.  Now ive written this incredibly long entry and im serioulsy debating about not posting it because 1) it violates every rule of the non-serious, laid back relationship and 2) i sound like the biggest fag ever.  But for real, i kno that your reading this i dont want you to think im tryin to get serious or anythin of that sort, i just thought about this all last night and i needed to get it off my chest.  Anyways i passed at least 2/3 of the test, so hopefully i reap the benefits next week (cough...jan 22...cough).

p.s. - i also realized last night i am the bitch in this relationship.  Shes got my chain and im stayin sober in part (actually mostly) because of her.  And then last night i made her take a picture with me and i called her just to make sure she got home alright.  SEAN = OBVIOUSLY THE BITCH"

"event","so i decided to write something cause im pretty bored bein grounded and all.  vacations been a long one so far considerin that i cant go anywhere or do much.  i did get to go out with cole yesterday which is always amusing.  we did our normal stupid shit that we find funny.  it was nice to realize yesterday that cole is really happy with kate and all.  thats all he would talk about and he would randomly just space off and then tell me he was thinkin about seein her.  that bitch owes me for that one.  todays my dad b-day so hopefully we go out to dinner so i dont gotta sit inside today.  i also gotta get my results from the test i took at the doctors.  of course i went to the doctor and told im nothin was wrong, when of course everything is wrong considerin i cant finish a whole meal without almost choking.  dont kno how that happens but it isnt good.  cant believe its almost new years. it feels like summer just ended.  this year was pretty fucked up, in a good way i guess.  a lot of stuff went down, good and bad, but overall it was pretty intersting.  kinda sucks i gotta stay in for new years but at least i kno i aint gonna be missin nothin. kev might come over so that'll be a good time if he does.  i missed out on the wachusett trip yesterday.  that sucks.  w/e though im goin snowboardin a couple times with kev when i get off groundatoin.  i startin to wonder why i wrote this considerin that no one will read it, but w/e its wastin time so thats always a plus.  so groundatoin sucks and the reason i got grounded wasnt even mine.  it was nicks, wtf im stuck inside cause i took  his shit so he wouldnt get caught.  w/e i made a mistake by lookin out for my friends, not myself.  so im not in the greatest of moods right now considerin that i still got a whole half of vacation left to stay inside.  i dont think i got any more excuses for goin out so looks like ill prob be inside for the rest of it.  i guess the best thing to do is look forward to my b-day after i get off grounding.  i dont kno why i should look forward to it though cause i got no faith in somethin good happening after what happend last year.  w/e though maybe someone will come up with something good.  i can get my tattoo though so thats pretty sweet.  im leanin toward a celtic cross or a shamrock with initials in it.  someone told me i should get a heart which at first i thought wasn't me, but then after some thought i dont kno i kinda like it and gotta look into it more.  im kinda pissed off at how this whole grounding thing has gone.  it was lookin good last thurs day but since its all gone downhill."

"event","So last night i was watchin the world series of poker.  There were two guys left, raymer and david williams.  On the last hand raymer and pocket eights and i think williams had ace, two off suit.  Anyways the flop, turn, and river go down and williams lands a full house.  Problem is williams pair is 2's and raymer's got 8's.  Both go all in and williams loses the pot and loses his chance at 5 million.  I mean he did get 3.5 million, but thats not the point.  The reason i told you this is cause williams went out givin himself the best possible chance to win it all and it made me think.  I thought about how i always tell myself im gonna give it my all and do everythin perfect but i never do. it made me realize how much ive screwed up for the shear fact that i havent done everythin i could to help the situation. This specifically directed me toward my relationships and how much ive fucked every last one of those up.  ill finish up tomorrow, but the thing i realized most after last nights thinkin was that u dont kno what u actually have until its gone and u cant get it back."

"event","I'm back.  A lot has happened over the past month that i could sit here and type about for an hour, but i aint gonna waste my time doin that.  Theres been a bunch of fun, crazy shit, some pretty depressin shit, but most of all a lot of confusin shit.  Most of u that read this know that the last time i posted here i was in a pretty bad situation, where i prob was or maybe wasnt bein an ass.  You guys all have ur own opinions about that, obvious by that livejournal war in my comments.  In those comments there was a lot of shit that wasnt true, a lot of stuff that was blown out of propotion, and a lot of words that made me realize what i really had done.  I regret not sayin anythin to shawna and i regret not really tellin her how i felt and ill admit im sort of scared to talk to her now cause its been so long, but is has to be done.  After last night and what was said, i have to talk to her and clear things up.  Anyways though thanks for those who backed me up and called people out shit that wasnt true and defended me on things that were bein said.  If i had enough time i would love to tell everyone the shit that wasnt true and shit on the people that shitted on me when i couldnt defend myself cause they deserve it, but i dont.  Anyways ive realized a lot about my friends and about life in general.  Ive realized that ive changed but not to the point that i thought i had.  I still make shitty decisions and dont think when i should and i still try to convince myself that im always right.  But hey maybe that will change in time.  Theres also been a lot of shit with me and girls in the past month.  That kinda stuff seems to get more complicated each day.  I dont really wanna get into it, but lets just say its hard not having a girlfriend for me.  Not havin someone to care about, havin someone to talk to at night, havin someone thats always there for you, and most of all havin someone to be yourself with and kno that no matter what you do or say, they'll still care about u the same.  Most people that dont really kno me seem to think that i just get into relationships to get some, but thats so far off from the truth thats its ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong its fun as hell to be able to do stuff with someone, but its not all about that.  W/e though cause those of you that really kno me, kno that i care about my gfs to death and those of you that dont really kno me, prob wont believe me.  I still got some more to say but i gotta eat so ill save it.  I'm out."

"event","This week has been one to remember.  Me getting myself into some pretty fucked up situations, me and cole lovin the fact that we were in deep shit, and of course the normal fallin out in a relationship.  I'm not really too keen on tellin my personal shit online, so if u really wanna kno what happened in the past week, just give me a call.  All i'm gonna say about this week is that in the past when shit like this happened i tried to fix everything and i thought about it way too much, but now i realized that im 17 and all i wanna do is have fun and be with the people that let me do that.  I have a lot of great friends that i kno i can have fun with and always seem to find some crazy shit to get ourselves into, so i ain't gonna waste my time with people that are gonna bitch at me and make me unhappy.  That's that.  Me and cole have been reekin havoc the past week, just like old days.  Nothin really special, just crazy shit that me and cole enjoy that no one else would.  A lot of the shit that i did the past week is pretty confidential (at least for now), so i really ain't got much to say.  I did have another softball game though.  I had another great game, even better than the last.  I went 4 for 6, with 3 hrs and 9 rbi.  I'm leadin the league in homers, so thats pretty sweet.  I gotta go shower and shit before i take off, so i'm out for now.

"event","Yea so a couple of days ago me, cole, john, and shawna were at my house playin planet hollywood and trivial pursuit.  The entire night, we were makin fun of cole cause he was makin his normal dipshit comments and doin stupid shit at the hanover mall and all night he tried to defend what he said and did.  Anyways we're at my house and one of the categories in planet hollywood was name movies with one word titles.  First person to go....Coleman.....his answer.....terminator two.  What a dumbass, when you hear that your answer has to be one word and you end up sayin two, you should've of known how stupid you are, but of course cole didn't even realize til we told him what he did.  That was the first thing.  Next in trivial pursuit there was a question the read something like name a country in asia that exports tea or somethin like that and cole of course answers....asia.  Cole....when the answer your givin is in the question.....its prob not right. Just a hint.  Not too mention this all came one night after one of the funniest nights in years due to cole's stupidity.  The night before me, cole, and shawna ended up buyin one of those hoverdiscs at the mall, you know the things that float up and come back down, a crazy foreign guy sells them.....yea u kno.  Anyways cole's in the backseat readin the directions and he says that it says we have to use helium.  So we go to i-party and fill the hoverdisc with helium.  All good for now.  Then i'm lookin over the directions and read we could of used air, cole missed that.  O well, no biggie we still got it filled and its ready to use.  So we go out to pageant field and take it out.  So we're throwin it around and i notice its not comin down very easily.  I ignore and keep throwin it.  Then shawna throws it and it floats up and decides not to float back down.  It just kept on goin up.  I ended up chasin it all the way into the woods to realize that it wasnt comin back.  So we get back in the car, pretty disappoined cause we lost our glow in the dark hoverdisc.  Couple minutes later, cole starts to crack up.  So me and shawna wait like 10 mins for him to talk cause he was laughin so hard.  He finally blurts out that it says DO NOT USE HELIUM IN HOVERDISC OUTDOORS, HOVERDISC MAY FLY AWAY.  So we all start crackin up, then i say hey at least it wasn't in big bold letters.  Then i should of expected what happened next, cole shows me it and bam look its in big bold letters.  Then i started laughin and couldnt stop cause i realized how truly dumb cole is.  You should of seen how big and bold those letters were.  Had a softball game on thursday.  That was wicked fun even though we lost 43-15.  I had a great game.  I went 4 for 5 with a home run.  I should of been 5 for 5 with two home runs.  Ok so i had the last at bat and i told my team, after this at least we'll lost 43-17, so i was callin a home run.  I did it jokingly, but at the time i was ready to crank one.  So this guy, who looked really similar to graeber, threw up the softball and as it was comin down, i unloaded.  I hit this ball a mile, furthest hit of the game and further than my first home run.  Problem with the y field is that theres no fences.  So when i hit this blast they had a guy playin like in the marsh and so of course my luck he jumps and catches the ball with the tip of his glove.  I was so pissed, but it was a fittin way to end the game.  I just couldn't belive i hit one that far and they had someone strategically placed all the way out there. I started the game pitchin too.  I let up 29 runs, but wait a sec, 26 of them were unearned.  My defense dropped about 9 balls in a row.  I would of let up like 8 runs total if they caught the balls.  O well, it was wicked funny cause none of them could catch.  So then i switched to short where i made five outs in one inning cause our first basemen wasn't on the bag twice.  I made a diving catch, went behind the second basemen in the outfield and gunned one to first, and made three other pretty good plays.  I was proud cause i hadn't used my glove in a while and i was the best on the field.  MVP for my team, can't wait til next thursday for game two.  Damn a lot has happened since my last entry thing.  I'll be back later to finish up.....peace.

"event","Most of you know already but for those of you who don't, i'm a camp counselor at the quincy y and for some reason the boss likes me and trusts me with 10 kids all to myself.  Obviously my boss isnt the smartest person ever cause i dont have the greatest temper and she gave me the ""bad"" kids.  What i mean is she decided to put together all satan's children in one group and give them to me and mike.  So i spend my day yellin my ass off and wanting to kill these fuckin kids.  But at certain points of the day i get my revenge and it comes in the form of a dodgeball to the face.  Before the job i hadn't played dodgeball since the days of bombardament at central, so i was a lil rusty.  But now after a couple weeks of dodgeball, aka bombardament, at the ymca, i've become quite adept at hittin these kids.  I can now throw these balls and hit the kids square in the face.  This one lil black kid, jardelle, wouldn't listen all day so i threw a ball so damn hard it lifted him off the ground and slammed his head on the mat.  For some reason he decided to listen for the rest of the day.  Anyways i'm sittin here with 410 dollars in front of me wonderin what i should waste it on.  Prob some new kicks and some other stupid shit.  Couple of days ago i was having a good time talkin to an old friend, before i was interrupted.  Kinda pissed me off, but i got a feelin, or at least i'm hopin, i'll be talkin to this person some more.  Then i went to shawna's where we did the usual hiding from her dad cause he likes to spy on us.  It was a good night to say the least. Forgot to mention that i got to ""watch"" titanic.  It wasn't half bad, cept for the fact that i had to leave 5 mins before the ending.  I never got to find out whether jack or rose died.  Found out later that jack died.  He deserved it, the dipshit had enough room on the door for him and rose.  Suppers ready....im out"

"event","Just got back from work and i'm waitin for shawna to get back from nantucket.  I started up this journal cause over the past year so much shit has happened to me and i can't remember most of it.  At least now i can write down the stupid, funny, confusing shit that seems to happen to me more often than not.  Most of you who read this know me, some better than others, but almost none of you realize what goes on through my head.  Now you'll get the chance. Half the time i don't make sense, most of the time i'm wrong, but i'm always interesting at the least.  The last year has been pretty rough and i've done a lot of stupid shit and i've been an ass to people that i care about (one in particular), but things are starting to change mostly due to the fact that i'm changin.  I've always heard the saying ""learn from your mistakes"" but up until about a month or two ago, i never actually listened to it.  I wish i started listenin to it long before i did.  Anyways though i'm startin to realize how hard it is to make time for everythin and everybody.  Workin seven days a week, softball after work, hangin with new people, not fogettin old people, and most importantly always having time for my girl.  It's been hard, but damn its been fun.  You'll see what i mean in the future.  I'm out for now.....later"

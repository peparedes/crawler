"event","Yeah that was my New Years..and in that order too.

I was planning to have a good night but my plans were canceled and so I spent it at Alys' house with my brother still kind of sad about my night.&nbsp; So, I guess since I turned my phone off I pissed someone off.&nbsp; I got called a bitch right after midnight and I had to leave, I couldn't stop my eyes from watering up and as soon as I was outside of the apartment I lost it.&nbsp; I was just going to go home and cry myself to sleep..pretty pathetic right?
I called Tara and she wanted to keep me company for a bit to try and cheer me up, so I went to the hotel her and her guy were at and I guess there was a party on the floor they were on, in a few of the rooms..you could hear them slamming doors and yelling.&nbsp; Tara and I decided to go out into the hallway to see what all the commotion was.&nbsp; We see a bunch of teenagers yelling at someone and someone was yelling at them..we couldn't see who.&nbsp; Saw some woman on her phone with, I'm guessing, the Cops.&nbsp; So, we hear some older guy yelling at these people to leave the building and some were trying to get to the other elevator away from this guy, we couldn't see him, but I did hear him say to one of the kids &quot;I'll bust a cap in your ass.&quot;&nbsp; Then we see him come into sight holding onto some kid, I told Tara &quot;Dude, he has a gun in his hand&quot; she didn't see it at first but then she noticed it too and said time to get back into the room.&nbsp; So she closed the door and were sitting around, then we decide look out the window and noticed about 13 cop cars outside the hotel..haha
I go back into the hallway to see if anything was going on and saw a few more kids crying and heading towards one of the elevators.&nbsp; Tara of course got mad at me saying to close the damn door that she didn't want to die ..so I did.
It finally got quiet and we went back into the hallway and there was a cop right outside the room we were in so we started to talk to him and mentioned that there was a guy who was holding a gun, they showed us the guy and we said yes.&nbsp; Of course he didn't have the gun on him anymore, and he didn't have a concealed weapons permit on him either..Oops.&nbsp; So they took us downstairs to write out statements based on what we saw and asked me a few questions about how the guy was holding the gun, whether it was pointed at someone or no.
Finally, they all leave and I decide it's time to go home after crying off and on and really not sure how I felt about the gun, didn't scare me for once..Usually just looking at a gun makes me scared ..I didn't feel anything ..heh
So I get home and try to sleep, and by 4am I was getting a call saying I was being bitchy and pissed off the person that made me cry..Slept for another 4 hours before I had to get up for work..yay.&nbsp; Of course, we only made like 50 bux from 9am till 1:30pm it was pathetic.&nbsp; I get to do it all again tomorrow too..I get a weekend and i'm excited..about that, but my weekend already was ruined sort of..Might just be going to my parents and hide out.&nbsp; Who knows..

Anyway that's my drama for the New Year..what a great fucking way to start 2009...fuck.."

I think I could run out of flowers and there wont be anything left of me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;never do anything wrong...ever..I guess you could say giving and loving someone is wrong but then what the fuck is the point?&nbsp; It's not just about Jase, it's about anyone I've ever cared for and wanted to give them a part of me.&nbsp; Some people accept it but kind of shrug it off and wind up tossing it later, or some just take it and destroy it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to find someone who would look&nbsp; me in the eyes and smile at the fact that I'm so giving and willing to share a part of me with him.&nbsp; I honestly think I'm making sense, am I&nbsp;crazy?&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't think so, maybe a bit depressed but surely I'm not crazy.<p>My plans for the weekend have been shot to shit..hopefully I&nbsp;still can find something fun to do ..I just don't want to be alone all weekend..sitting at the apartment or something..Oh well..</p><br />"

WHAT?!&nbsp; You make him turn out to be the bad guy when you are FUCKING&nbsp;SOMEONE&nbsp;ELSE?!?!&nbsp; Did he touch another girl??? Did he look at them?..Most guys look but&nbsp; know the rule...NO&nbsp;FUCKING&nbsp;TOUCHING..He feels horrible and takes the blame and you let him??<br />I&nbsp;invited you over last night to spend time to hang out where you could get away from everything and just hang out with the girls..but all you did was talk to Jeff and obsess over his texts all night...Then you wrote up on your myspace that you missed your nerdo..and your ex fiancee thought it was about him..saying he had a present for you and loved you very much.&nbsp; You shrugged it off and continued to text Jeff.<br />You got a phone call from your ex..and said he was a bit drunk ..packed his bags..and there was blood everywhere?...you were getting ready to leave, and I could understand wanting to leave sooner, but Tara stopped you...I&nbsp;would have left then and there..but you didn't.&nbsp; You went outside to smoke a cigarette and Ginny calls your phone you come back into my apartment with the cigarette, which kinda pissed me off..and you took the call...your ex had walked to her apartment and passed out on the floor..and you were gone ..you couldn't get out the door even you were trying too fast...<br /><br />I&nbsp;saw you this morning..he went to the hospital and is on suicide watch..Does he know about what happened yet?..I highly doubt it..<br />I&nbsp;may not know everything that happened between the two of you, but I&nbsp;do know that you are fucked up..you said it yourself..<br />You're trying to fill that void your dad never provided for you..someone to watch over you and protect you..and one comes along and you get bored and find something new and more exciting ..but it doesn't last either..or you just cannot make up your damn mind..can you?<br />I&nbsp;feel sorry for him..I feel sorry for Jeff too..I feel sorry for every guy you've ever manipulated..and fucked with..even my own fucking brother..lucky for you Chris doesn't give a fuck about you or anything about you..and little brother..is a smart one and got out before it got bad.&nbsp; I wish I could too..<br />I wish I&nbsp;could just quit, and get away far far..fucking away..maybe if the boss gets the new store you'll just stay up there so I&nbsp;don't have to see you or hear anything about you..and your fucked up life.&nbsp; I&nbsp;care about you, but sometimes you push the wrong buttons..I&nbsp;have respect for people..the people that I care about..mean a lot to me..you're slipping..what you do is your own business sure..but when you say you love someone..mean it..respect it..respect them..Love them..TRULY&nbsp;love them...finding someone like that is hard to come across and you throw it out like yesterday's fucking newspaper..STOP.<br />I&nbsp;finally found a place that I can just sit here and talk about what is bothering me...about what you've done to all these people..and not worry ...It's still not enough..but it helps ..this feeling ..these thoughts have been sitting inside me for weeks..and I have no clue what to do with them..I can't release them..I can't talk to anyone because they are all our friends ..that would most likely tell you in a heartbeat.<br /><p>I'm done for now..I'm home alone, and I&nbsp;just..had no where else to go..figured this was the most healthy thing to do...</p><p>Goodnight..you horrible woman..</p><br />"

"event","I really have officially decided I really can't stand Jase and his bull shit anymore..
The fact that he said he wouldn't actively look for anyone and then when I made the plans to see him and spend time with him, he goes and starts doing exactly what he said he wouldn't do.&nbsp; Calls me to tell me I'm going to be sleeping on the bed alone ..that he didn't want to do anything ..so I decided to save myself the heartache and just stay with Richard and Sarah and he still is upset or something that I made that choice....Fuck you!
I was coming to see you and only you and here you are going off banging some other girls, or whatever you are going to do and blow me off...again!&nbsp; You did this to me in January when we were going to maybe go to Vegas, I took the time off and was getting ready and you blow me off for some 20 year old with a kid??????&nbsp; I told you I didn't want to stay with you because it would be so fucking awkward and here you are getting mad..and making plans over me..You didn't think I wanted to see you when I said the only thing I didn't want to do was stay with you because I'd wind up crying and have some kind of anxiety attack..if it's anything like how it was in Anchorage with Mike...bringing other girls into the house while I was living there..I'll pass thanks.&nbsp; 
You have no right to be upset at me for this, and if you really do blow me off for some other girl or whatever on Saturday, then we're through..I won't call you anymore and I wont even write you ..We'll be done, I can't even be friends with someone who thinks treating girls and their feelings like they are garbage..doesn't fly with me.&nbsp; 
You don't mess with peoples feelings..you don't mess with how I devote my heart to you.&nbsp; I thought this would be it, that I'd get to be with someone that I really enjoyed being with, but I guess with you living in Spokane it really just wont work out..and in a way I'm glad I didn't make any sort of commitment because had I, you'd be off doing whatever and I'd be on my own..just like I will be this weekend thanks to you and your selfish ways.."

A lot of memories, some I'm glad I can't remember even if I read the blogs..and some I wish I could remember what I was talking about.

Both jobs are driving me insane, and school is the only fun thing I enjoy doing but I have so little time to do it all, it's insane.&nbsp; I work every day except some Saturdays ..between both of the jobs.
I keep wanting to tell Tony that I don't really want to work for him anymore, they need me and it makes it difficult to even bring it up.&nbsp; I told him my focus is on my other job at it comes first, even if I get about the same amount of hours at both jobs now, Tony offered more..problem with that is, I don't want to make subs 40 hours a week...sorry ..it's more stress than my other job.&nbsp; Sure I can breathe better just working there, I don't have to lift as much and I'm really just standing in one spot....it's so boring!!!!

Well I guess I wouldn't say it's cool just means I've found other places to vent but I figured I would go somewhere else where people I work with can't find what is wrong with me.
Every single guy I like is now dating someone ...
CJ, Adam, Aaron ...It hurts deep down knowing that Aaron is ignoring me and CJ is just a prick...Adam I just lost contact with and he kind of disappeared.
I am so angry at my life and I really freaking hate it ..
I know life doesn't revolve around guys but honestly if every single guy you like and knows likes you goes and does something rude..like leading you on and whatever then dates another girl..I think that it would hurt.
I just want something right to happen where I am happy or something.. I am going to be 23 in 12 days....And it's just fucked that I have to live my life in this ..I hate me I hate you life..
No I am far from Emo..trust me if you met me you would think I was weird but I am not Emo.
Why can't I be happy?
I went to Ocean Shores with my brother and his girlfriend and I sat around and was mopey apparently ...I guess that's just me..
I don't have a damn clue and now this is where I stop it I guess...maybe I might come back for another entry ..not like anyone really pays attention to this ..it's just like everyone else's where they complain ..but anyway...see ya"

Drama followed by mild heart ache..
You just can't escape any of it.
Though,
Aaron has been on my mind so much, and I want to find him again.  It's been 5 months since he was released I believe, and he said it takes 3-4 months for a parole transfer and I haven't heard from him.  I am somewhat patient about it, but with a guy like him you just can't forget them.
We'll see I suppose.

"event","I haven't written in quite sometime and I felt maybe I should tell people how I am or what's been going on in my life.
Here it goes:
I have had a job for a few months and it's by far, one of the best things i've done since I moved to Washington.
I wish I could say it was all good..
Examples would be with my ex Scott..
Who betrayed me since the start, and who I tend to think about.  Thankfully I haven't seen him but the few times I saw him at the mall when I was first working there.
My dear friend Aaron who has been in jail since last year, that I just found again and have written and actually heard from him and sent me a photo.  I truly miss him..One of the few sweet..caring people that I've met here..or back home..(for guys that is.)  I haven't been able to talk to him much since he was sent to New York, but one day he'll be back and I'll be waiting.
My family is shakey..
My mom is crazy..in one way or another.
Medications because of a pain she has, and possibly a surgery(not life threatening)  but definitely makes living in this house very difficult.  
My brother is in town and it's been nice to spend time with him and catch up on things.  Of course, when it comes to him my mom tends to forget she has two other kids, but since we are both older and understand what she does and who she is it's not a mind fuck.
I lack friends..
I have a few people I talk to at work, but nothing outside of it.  I've been avoiding being online only because it takes a lot more effort than normal.  If I am on, i'm really not around.
There are really no special things going on..people are happy some arent..even the ones that are happy aren't all that happy.
Me.
I need people to keep me happy. I don't want to sound needy or anything, I never want that, I hate just focusing on me. It's always about my friends and that's how it's supposed to be.  I wouldn't have it any other way, I just wish that maybe someone out there would be here for me..like I thought Scott was.  Duh, that was a big lie..none of it was real. Creepy .
I'm not what people want in life, I don't know what people want..then again I do.
The ones I want..can't be reached..
Make a void..Make a bubble make something to fill that gap. Right? .
Sure, I know i'm a lot alike with others..
I try not to think about that, because i'm sure I don't know who ..or anything normally.
I wont be depressed tomorrow for the start..I love spending holidays with family and Duh, the presents.  By the end of the night, i'm sure i'll be thinking about the things I always think about...Scott..Home..People i've known..people who worked hard to forget who I was. Mike..and Mike..and many others
I'll be here the next day..and the day after..no doubt about that one.


Anyway..
I hope you all have a good Xmas..
It should be a good day ..smile ..think about the better things..even if things are bad..try and put some kind of good thought in your head..a memory ..or something to keep you going.
Much Love..
~Ash"

We talked..said somethings

Kids...kittens..I don't really know..Both probably(don't know don't remember don't ask haha), being taken away two were a boy and a girl who liked football, with the numbers 34 and 27..so I wanted to remember them both
I got the numbers tattooed on my arms, 27 was on my right and 34 on the left, placed in the same spots on each arm, dont know the area that its called but I guess a lil more than halfway up the arm from the elbow..
Anyway, the 27 was decorated with a blue..like navy blue dragon sitting, his head turned, and looking 'out of my arm' and one wing had an angel or some kind of fair in it as well..then there was like a red serpent dragon climbing up the 7, I think, but its head reminded me of the dinosaur ..almost like the stego..but he was kinda furry but not?..I dont know green eyes and a darker red..then there was a tail of a white tiger..I dont remember where the rest of him was maybe ontop of the 27..The 34 was just getting started she had a stencil of a fire ring, like a circle with just a few flames on the top and was going to do that around the 34..and had only just finished drawing out the flames on my arm with a pen, then I guess I started thinking about my nose and repiercing it..THEN..I woke up..
The drawing is badass in my head..and it wont stay there for long wich sucks fucking ass...but..yeah that's my dream ..OH there was a bit more like I was there and looking up some profile like through yahoo(obviously I spend too much time on there but oh well) ..And that's it..:)"

He didn't mean the perv gutter..
He had a bad break up like me..and we started to talk, pathetic thing is I'm not there anymore..yet we started to like each other?
It tears me up because I fell kinda quick..Yea I like him quite a bit and I would like to be there for him..
And I know he sort of likes me..but..he's the one that pointed out im here..and he's there ..he didn't say anything about burning bridges..or..calling it quits...I just wish he would open up like me..but I know it wont happen that is kinda why Im so upset over it...
He's a great guy and he doesn't seem to get told that very often..I don't see why not he's a very cute guy..and he's one of the shy quiet ones..
B knows who he is..so do a lot of people..hehe she'll slap me when she finds out..if she could it me :p
I wish I was back home..and he's one of the reasons why..
Anyway..I went to my neighbors to watch them do their EWA show..and took a bunch of photos..that are up on my site..if you wanna see what i'm talkin about.
Anyway I gotta go...

"event","You want to know what's going on?
I feel extremely miserable right now, it hasn't been this bad since like the first week he and I broke up.
I can't stop thinking about when we met, and after when we sat at Denny's waiting for his luggage to get in.
I remember the drive, I remember so much, and all of a sudden  he's fucking another girl, and ignoring anything and everything about me.
I can't stop, and it's so sickening, to think I could love a guy that is so heartless and cold.
I can't talk to him, I'm trying so hard to keep his number out of my head, I haven't heard nor seen him since the breakup, which is a fucking good thing, because I don't think i'd handle either one.
I did see J online though and it didn't help that I heard the song he sang to me all the time earlier today.
I keep thinking about the breakup, the last night I stayed with him, the stuff I saw, the things I should have done.
I'm not doing well, I'm alive but I don't have anyone around, Kiri can't always be here, and Richard had to go to Louisiana because of the Guard.
Aaron hasn't written since March, I don't know if I'll ever hear from him either.
I'm back to nothing all over, I even met someone when I was with Becky at her mom's wedding but he hasn't called me, since the night we all were together, don't fully understand but I get an idea.
I'm being rejected and ignored everywhere..
I'm fucking 21 years old, and i'm fucking psychotic...
I can't even talk to anyone, because no one wants to hear it, and it still makes me sick when I try.
I need help, or something..and I can't get it, my family doesn't understand no one fucking does..and I have no escape..so now the tears start coming out..and I've lost it..

I've got nothing..
I am nothing"

Every day I've cried, once, twice...three times or more..
My emotions are out of control and so is my sanity..
Scott wants nothing to do with me it seems, he came by for an hour to help load furniture Saturday, and that was it..
Midst a few lies inbetween everything he is now ignoring me...Or something
I'm still crying
I'm depressed
I wanted a relationship that would work, and it did, for the first month, and now I see nothing hear nothing..and fear..
He lies all the time, and lies lead to paranoya..and severe damage to a relationship
He wants me to trust him and he trusts me..I have done nothing but give..and be there and now..I get the cold shoulder..
It makes no sense to me, but relationships are something I am not familiar with..Obviously i'm difficult to be with, I crave attention..I need to be with someone often, I can't stand being alone, or to atleast know they think of me and care..
And that feeling has left me..I feel so cold, and alone, and moist eyes..from tears that don't seem to want to end..
I can't end it, I've never had to, I like him so much, but when it comes to lies, I fall weak..and just ..hold on to ..practically nothing..

He says it's because he's busy trying to make sure he has a place to be come Thursday..

After missing out on an important date..off to Seattle..and wandered the big city from the ocean side up to the town to find the Showbox and get pictures of the tour bus of theory of a deadman and maybe breaking benjamin's..walked around a lot then decided around quarter after 5, that it was time to get in line, and when we did, Ben, was talking to some of the girls and signing autographs and getting pictures taken..I was in shock..until after I was behind him..I died..and came back to life..I was sad..but a lot more people showed up the guitarest from theory of a deadman walked around and so did someone else...then scott from the exies came out and the new girl I met, got a picture and a kiss on the cheek from him before he went in.  I was damn excited, and waiting almost impatiently as well..
It was getting closer and closer and they moved us to the back area, and finally we were let in, and we rushed to get up front and off to the side, and here we were watching..waiting..
Up comes the Exies, and was totaly amazing..up close watching every move..Then crowd surfing..and OW..I got clobbered from behind as someone was brought forward to the big guys...happened a bunch through the night..
Then up comes Theory of a Deadman, and wow maybe 2 songs from them I did not know.  Their new album, which I will be getting, ..has some excellent musit on it..Then...
BREAKING BENJAMIN
This lil brat kept tryin to squeeze by me and I wouldn't move and then somehow Scott was getting pushed further and further away from me..and all these lil women were behind me jumping up and down leaning on me pushing me tryin to get in front or beside me...especially the first girl..
But man, I'll tell you..that was some insane stuff right there, people moving from left to right people flying over you crashing into the big guys..it was insane..bright lights BEN..and the music..
Then the end..but of course, an Encore, after Breaking Benjamin exited the crowd roared ""benjamin ..benjamin.."" stomping screaming..finally he comes out ..a beer(im guessing) and a cigarette in the other hand..he raises his hands at the mic and burps..says he'll do one more song but we have to sing along ..duh which song do you think?  Anyway he leans down hands a girl that I met earlier his cig. and grabbed his guitar and played ""Rain, and near the end the rest of the group came out and made it all the more exciting..drums bass and more guitar and rocked out to the end of the song..Chad (the drummer came down and shook a bunch of our hands ..Yes me and Scott and the girls around me)  So overall I'm deaf...sore from standing and walking all afternoon and night..im good..I got a Breaking Benjamin drumstick and a guitar pick from the exies and theory of a deadman ..THANK YOU SCOTT..for your tallness..I wanted to take photos..but they are so damn retarded about it, and they had their own video guy and camera guy..(cept breaking benjamin didnt..they are the ones goin off about pictures I guess)..but..Im sad...very sad..I would have done so well..I think..but whatever I have it all in my head.. :D
Anyway...that's my wee bit of an update ..
Luv yaz

"event","Heh, I finally have the chance to have things go ...good...
The house is coming along nicely...I have to figure out how the hell I'm doing my wall still..SOMEONE HELP
It's a dark blue and I wanted to brush silver over it, BUT the texture of the wall makes it reaalllllly difficult to do anything.  I've tried and tried and nothing is working and I REFUSE to do sponging..ICK
Anyway, Mom got stencils..and I can use one for a border along the top..I'll have some shelves going down at an angle from one corner to maybe the other..or just in the middle since its a big wall.
I have Blue, White and Silver added to the room, I need to add more silver..and drag out the blue..curtains new bed spread..things like that..and I found this awesome fan at Lowes..It's clear..and in the center, for the light is a neon light..(blue) in a coil shape. :D it's rad..
I still wish I could get the silver on the wall..and get it to look..Nice..but it ain workin.  It's been put off so everything in the house got done before it, which is fine.  The Kitchen is to be left to the people who are doin it..the Billiard room is fine..once we get a bar and stools..and stuff to add to the room..otherwise we just play pool when we have nothing to do.  It's the only fun thing to do out there..Except my brother and my boyfriend both kick my damn ass...  Boyfriend is a shark..he is damn good, so is my dad!!!  Jeff is learning quick..and Apparantley Chris has been playing a lot on base, and knows quite a bit.  Niiiiiice
Let's see, Scott and I have been together a month now and I have seen em' every day since he got back..I wonder if we'll get sick of each other...Hmm  So far, it sucks when he goes and he'd been over here crashing since he was helping with yard work and whatever this week and saving on gas money to get to gig harbor..Ugh
I wish things for him were easier..much more..He has been back and there's always something going wrong..family..and money issues..
Anyway, it's midnight almost and I really need sleep, all the house work is making my back ache a lot and me a sleepy sleepy gurl..Night guys..

Anyway..Life is not so bad
Spending lots and lots of time with the boy toy, enjoying the sunny weather, hating the fact that all of it is around the mom who drags me everywhere basically.
Out to the new house every damned day this week, except one..I'm sick of it, running around buying trees for their flowers not caring about the fucking fruit they grow..""I want pink and purple flowers"" Please, I swear she isn't blood, but then I'd be lying off my damn ass.
I get to go back to Alaska in June, I'm supposedly starting college soon, if I can get into my classes..*crosses everything that is able to be crossed on my body*..well no..if I was able to do that, I'd be cool..or something.
Sad days lately, coach richie died..I'm shocked, and stunned.  He was a great coach and a great family guy, the football players were another part of that family and everyone will truly miss him.
I enjoyed the few years I worked with him, he was an outstanding coach and mentor.
Other news, I plan to go to showbox on the 5th to go see....BREAKING BENJAMIN again..with the Exies and Theory of a Dead Man..tryin to get Jeff and Boy toy to both go either way I'm going..Hellz yeah..
So it's after midnight time for sleepy...

"event","Scott and I have seen each other every day so far this week, and it's become quite hard to actually say goodbye when we have to go..
Yesterday was a rough day, it involved the police ...
We were at Fred Meyers in Tumwater, and this cop asked if he was Scott, and then all these cops outside ..3 cop explorer vehicles...and like 5 cops..
I am not explaining what and why, but I was there trying hard not to cry and I wound up losing it after they let him go, walking back to the truck.  I wouldn't talk, I wouldn't look at him and I wouldn't answer him when he asked what I was thinking or what was wrong.  He kept saying he was sorry and explained that what they did was a scare tactic and they couldn't put a finger on him.  It's a misdemeanor charge..I guess and a warrant because of it..If you want to know exactly what it is I will explain it to you, just not on here..
I'm a bit paranoid with cops now, and it's not exactly a good night tonight either.  He had to make a drive up to the county he's wanted in..and the sheriff has been at the place he's been staying at..a few times, and I was just on the phone with him and he had to get off because there were headlights outfront..He said 2 minutes and it's been 4..
Cold, and scared...right now..
Also I took new photos today..while we went out walking ..I'm posting them on my website..I believe if you are smart you would know that it's in my info ..hah..And now I go..

But, he was sent to Virginia for 4 days, and was supposed to come home Monday and we were going to have a good time..Show me to a person who sold dragons who was interested in mine, as well as an airbrush artist..Instead, he is being deployed in 4 days to North Korea..Which wasn't supposed to happen until February.

We go to this cutlery/knife story and there was this guy there who was nice and in the military he had helped us the last time we had been to the store(before xmas).  Then there was this red head freak..He was also there the last time busy talking to some people about..something..fuck if I know, but it wasn't about helping someone in the store.
Anyway, today...Same guys..but the nice guy was busy talking a mile a minute about anything and everything the person he was helping, was looking at.
Then there was another gentleman looking at pocket knives and the red haird freak started to help him.  The gentleman asked about two different knives, and which one is more sturdy.  The fucking red head freak said ""Which is more sturdy a BMW, or some other god knows what kind of car that wasn't as well known)
I wanted to turn and look at the fucker and say what the fuck does a car have to do with knives?..
And sturdy?!  What the fuck ever..The red head was like here I'll let you compare them..and talked about the metal and whatever and that's when we proceeded to exit the store..
Then I came home after a long day of walking around to antique my dragon finally ..I'll have photos up and then edit this entry to show her off :D..Bye bye

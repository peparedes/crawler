"event","What color is God,
Asked the child with skin so fair
Is he white like me, does he have light hair

Is he dark like me,
Asked the child with skin of golden hue
Has he hair that's dark and curly
Are his eyes black and blue

I think God is red like me,
The Indian boy is heard to say
He wears a crown of feathers,
And turns our nights to day

Each one of us knows that God is there,
In all the colors above
But be sure of this, the one color he is,
Is the beautiful color of love

So when your soul goes to Heaven,
Everyone will be the same.
You will only be judged by your earthly deeds,
Not your color or your name

So when your time comes,
And you see God in his heaven above,
Then you will see the only color that counts,
The beautiful color of love."

"event","Bottled up inside
Are the words I never said,
The feelings that I hide,
The lines you never read.

You can see it in my eyes, 
Read it on my face:
Trapped inside are lies
Of the past I can't replace.

With memories that linger-
Won't seem to go away.
Why can't I be happier?
Today's a brand-new day.

Yesterday's are over,
Even though the hurting's not.
Nothing lasts forever,
I must cherish what I've got."

"event","this week i've been helping out at vacation church school with the little kids and they are so innocent and fun-loving. they are not prejudiced towards their peers and are carefree and only think about having fun playing together. when they get in fights they soon make up and then they are friends again. why can't life be that simple. why can't everyone be like a child, a child who loves the beauty and joys of life and doesn't get so caught up with the bad stuff? they try to make the best of a situation, they are so innocent...i wish my life was still as pure as that...without everything else there is to deal with!"

"event","From the time i wake up in the morning until the time i go to sleep all i hear is her telling me everything i've done wrong and all that i could do better.  she never understands that i try my hardest and that i just want to live my life the way that i feel is right.  i think that i do a pretty good job, but no. ""Stay home and babysit for me AGAIN!"" ""Clean your room or you can't leave the house!"" um hello, but there is like one sock on the floor! you are so uptight and dodn't understand that i like to be with my friends and AWAY from you. i try to get away as much as i can because when i do that i am getting away from you! nothing i do is ever good enough for you and i don't know what i am supposed to do to be that perfect little girl you always dreamed of because no matter how hard i try it's never enough! why can't you just love me and understand me for who  i am? that's all i need."

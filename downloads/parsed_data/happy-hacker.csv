"event","After some wailing and gnashing of teeth, I have Texlive 2014 working on my raspberry pi 2.  

How to do it? Go to http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html, download the installer and... wait. Before you pull the trigger, make /sure/ you can spare somewhere in the 6gb range of space on your root filesystem. The installer fails miserably if it runs out of space. I installed mine in a 10gb LV mounted to /usr/local/texlive on mine. 

Once you're sure you have enough space, just light fuse and get away. Be sure to follow the instructions where they say to add the /usr/local/texlive/yadda path to your default search path AND to texstudio if you use it (which I highly recommend.). It takes about an hour to run the full install.

If you seem to get a full install but never get the ""Welcome to Tex Live"" message, and especially if there just seem to be pieces missing, (a lot of it will still work) something's gone wrong with the install, and as far as I can tell, the only way to fix it is start over.

On the Pi model 2 it takes less than two minutes to compile a 361 page novel, including the glossary, all the way to a PDF with xelatex.  (On my desktop Linux monster pc and my Mac, it takes seconds,  but c'mon. 35 dollar computer. vs machines that both come in over the thousand dollar mark?)

Fun times.

"event","My new mac is more powerful than my old mac. Given that the new one is a mini quad core i7 and the old one was a 2006 mac pro quad-xeon, this wasn't obvious to the casual observer. It also didn't show in day-to-day use, when the faster CPU and more RAM were bottlenecked severely by the 5400RPM laptop drive in the mini.

Enter Samsung 840 EVO.

Working inside the mini is like doing neurosurgery. You have to have the right tools, steady hands, and there's a good chance that one slip of the knife will leave the patient unable to wake up. Everything I've read says that changing your mini's drives doesn't void Applecare /if/ the machine works afterwards. If it's obviously surgical damage, you're on your own. So yeah, a little trepidation. I followed the steps in this video: http://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/mac_mini2012_hd/ and everything worked.

Except for one tiny detail. See, Most operating systems, when they detect an SSD, enable TRIM, which is, I read, a SATA 3.1 standard mechanism for garbage collection on the SSD. Unless the SSD does this for itself (which OWC's drives do) performance will gradually degrade. OS X? Nope. It will glibly pretend it has no idea how to run TRIM on any non-apple SSD. There's a fix for this, of course. You can do it manually, or you can download the trim enabler app here: http://www.groths.org/. Basically what this does is edit the SATA driver and remove its ability to sense whether the drive is of apple manufacture or not. Once done, trim enables on any SSD, and seems to work fine. Others have verified that the trim commands are, in fact, being sent.

What's annoying is that Apple went out of their way to screw their customers here. They could have done the right thing: Trim works for Apple drives. It should work for your drive, but we don't guarantee that it will. (I believe they indemnify themselves from data loss anyway, so it's not like that's a stretch.) Instead, they added code to specifically exclude non-apple drives.

Digression:

I've been hitting this stuff a lot lately, where I'm realizing that apple screws its customers in subtle ways. Upgraded the iPhone 4 to IOS 7. It works. Slowly. Switched browsers to use Chrome so I can get bookmark syncing across platforms. Chrome is not allowed to use the fast browsing algorithms and javascript engine (I think) that Safari uses, so there's a performance hit. I'd sync my bookmarks in iCloud, save that getting them into any non-safari browser is tenuous, and Apple likes to pretend that Linux doesn't exist, so there's never any support for Linux even when Apple does benevolently reach out across platforms.

Finally, of course, I have this new mac because my quad-xeon mac pro, while it had plenty of CPU resources and a sufficiently fast video card to run Mountain Lion, was restricted from doing so because Apple put a 32 bit EFI boot system in it, and Mountain Lion and above won't boot unless they're in 64 bit mode. 

I'm getting very, very tired of this company giving me the shaft all the time. When the mini finally croaks (if it lives out its applecare contract, I'm ahead in dollars to years served compared to another mac pro) I'm going to give serious thought to whether I want another mac. The same decision will be in place much sooner when I have to give in and replace my macbook.

What's that, you say? Go to windows? You jest. Even if the windows 8 desktop wasn't an abomination that needs to die by fire, have your priced out what windows licenses /cost/?  Somewhere between 100 bucks (OEM license, bound to that motherboard, not transferable) to 200 bucks (all the bells and whistles and actual (useless) technical support). Do you get a discount to use win7? You do not. (You do get a desktop that is a reasonable copy of old versions of OS X, and is reasonably attractive and useful.) Apple is bad. Microsoft is much, much worse. 

I don't know where this will lead. I don't know what my computing platform is likely to be in the 2020s. There may be a paradigm change by then. But right now, it's looking more and more as though I'll be using something other than a mac. And it won't be running windows.

"event","Reason #1: It's not a real bootloader. It's using one kernel with different filesystems to change the kernel's behavior. This means that firmware updating and so forth are dependent on the berryboot folks' keeping up with the foundation. Which they don't seem to do.

Reason #2: Due to reason #1, the Raspberry Pi camera won't work. Since I just bought such a camera at Micro-Center (Which is a whole blog post to itself that I haven't written yet.)

Solution: Set the Pi up to boot from a normal flashcard and use the USB drive as the root file system. See http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=44177 for complete instructions. 

Except that I didn't do it quite like that. Since I have a big Linux box with my pi backup image on it, I mounted my flash card on the PC, made sure it had a vfat filesystem covering the whole thing, then followed the instructions for adding a custom OS to berryboot re: kpartx and mounting the various imaged drives. 

I mounted the boot partition of the image (the vfat one) and copied its contents to the card, then edited the cmdline.txt file on the flash card to point the root filesystem at /dev/sda1, inserted the pause that paulv recommended, then unmounted it. 

Then I plugged the USB drive to the big linux box, built a brand spankin' new ext4 partition and fs with gparted, mounted the second partition of the disk image, and used cp -pR to copy all the files from the second partition of the image to the USB drive's filesystem. (the p is important. It preserves all the ownership, group, permission, and access metadata on the files. Unix-ish OSes are very fussy about permissions.) This took a while. There's 8gb of stuff in that filesystem. Ye gods.

Once that was done, I edited the /etc/fstab on the usb drive to mount /dev/sda1 as the root file system, and dismounted the USB drive. 

Hooked everything back up to the Pi, and darned if it didn't work first crack. A quick dist-upgrade and a quick rpi-update, and I could enable the camera, and it works as advertised. Kudos to paulv for a great article, and to the berryboot people for some very useful tutorials that helped me, ironically, get their product off my disk. Sleep now."

"event","I admit it, I got annoyed with my PI.  I was sitting, minding my own business when the PI started to make ominous messages about not having executables, which smelled to me like yet another roached filesystem. I overclock my pi, I like my pi to swap, and sometimes things happen with turning it off unannounced, so filesystems tend to fall apart on me. So. Since I found myself with a cheap USB drive case just a tiny bit too unreliable for my time machine drive, and since I have a drawer full of old quarter-tb drives from previous upgrades, I made the leap<br /><br/>
I've read that Raspbian will happily boot from a USB drive if you change this and that parameter in the boot files, but I really wanted to use berryboot, the PI's original bootloader. One catch: I was looking at a ton of work either restoring from backups or reconfiguring a brand new raspbian install.<br /><br />Long story short, I found directions for making custom OSs for loading in berryboot, and I found out the secret hold-down-the-button trick to let you select the flash stick where your OS image is. Problem. It doesn't seem to copy from any flash stick format than FAT32. My OS image was bigger than 4gb. FAT32 fall down, go boom<br /><br />While at the gym, however, it dawned on me. This is a USB drive. Plug it into my big linux junk box and just cp the file over. Which I did. Berryboot found the image, assumed it belonged there, and booted it right up. <br /><br />Getting swap took some more tinkering. Apparently berryboot uses a special filesystem to allow images like this to work, and that filesystem does not like dphys-swapfile at all. However, I looked at the mount point where hte USB drive was mounted in the first place, went there, and discovered I could see the image list, so I edited /etc/dphys-swapfile to add CONF_SWAPFILE /media/usb0/myraspswapfile, told dphys-swapfile to uninstall (clearing the old, nonfunctional swapfile) then told it to setup, then told it to swapon. Voila.  Now it bears mentioning that I don't know whether this is stable... but so far it works."

This explains much.  :P Anwyay, it's a good  test of my Pi's heat production, albeit with highly unscientific methods. After an hour with the CPU pegged, my Pi's SOIC is just slightly too warm to touch comfortably. It doesn't burn me, but it's hotter than I care to leave my finger on. The SD card seems to be slightly warmer than room temperture. The only other part with any observable increase in temperture over ambient are the LEDs.

"event","Since I seem to post computer-specific geekery to this blog rather than my usual one, let's continue that theme. For the last month or so I've been playing with a Raspberry Pi. (now I have two of them - a 256mb and a 512). I've already thought of projects to do, in my copious spare time, but until recently I've been bashing away on the fundamentals: why does my filesystem keep falling apart?

The answer turned out to be overclocking. Raspbian makes it easy to overclock the pi, and it's semi-supported by the foundation. Unfortunately overclocking seems to screw up the timing to the SD card slot.

My test was top copy a few gigs of data onto the card over the network from my mac. At 1ghz (300mhz overclocked) it would average between 30 and 50 megs copied before the system hung, and usually I'd have to do a lot of fsck -y to get the filesystem to even mount again. 

By contrast, with my new, fast card (which was having miserable problems with corruption overclocked) accepted 5gb of continuous writes over afp without a hitch at the default 700mhz. It passed a forced fsck with  flying colors afterwards too.

I do feel the difference between the 700mhz and 1ghz Arm6, but the fast sd card mutes that a great deal, as does the additional ram of the 512mb Pi, so at this point I'm abandoning overclocking in favor of data preservation.

That done, I've been playing with mpd/mpc on the pi with an eye toward repurposing an antique radio I've been meaning to restore for 10 years. (The chassis needs a complete rewire - the insulation has literally fallen off all the existing wire. I don't want to do the work, basically.) I'm picturing ripping most of the guts out of the chassis, and building a simple push-pull tube amp with  a couple of the sockets, regulating the 6.3v filament circuit down to 5 volts to power the pi, and something clever which I have not yet sorted out for the tuning knob/station selection. Perhaps a small LCD panel behind the old glass."

"event","Wow. Has it really been a year? Am I really only posting to try out Drivel on my raspberry pi? Er... yes.  

However, there's been interesting news in Apple's first post-Steve year. Management shakeups, the iPhone 5 hasn't been a stellar release and IOS 6 is a bit of a turkey. On the flip side, iPad mini is out, finally.

Predictions: Only this. Apple needs to come up with a new product. Not necessarily a game changer like iPad/iPhone, but something to prove they can do new products without Steve Jobs. If they don't, they'll continue to make money, but the soul will be gone. They'll become the next RIM, waiting for some younger, hungrier, less ossified company to take their market away.

How will they avoid this? 
1. Get rid of Tim Cook. He was a fine minion for Steve Jobs, but as fine minions often are, he's a poor leader, and he's not a vision guy. I'm not sure who should lead apple. Johnny Ive seems like the logical choice, and he seems to be gravitating toward the role, but I'd hate to see him out of the business of individual contribution to Apple's products. 

2. Don't bloat the company with pretty white boy executives from other companies. Cook's done this already to some extent, and the recent management shakeup included letting one of them go. Whoever leads Apple needs to pick their minions carefully, and those minions need to understand what makes Apple work, what makes the Apple Store work. It's easy to tell when you have a pretty white boy manager because they apply all the pat, generic corporate solutions. Cutting hours, cutting training (especially at the Apple Store), layoffs, corner cutting, and cheapening the product. (See also: IPhone 5 and its aluminum case that can be scratched by pocket change.) 

3. Invent. There's a lesson to be learned from the wildfire success of the Raspberry Pi. For 35 bucks, you have a computer as capable as an early aughties desktop box with a swanky video card (drivers still forthcoming) and a big, slow disk. I'm not sure what the lesson is, but if I were Apple, I'd have my exceedingly bright market people thinking about this. The days of expensive desktop computing may be slipping into the past. There's money to be made on disposable computing. Whether a boutique brand like Apple can or would capitalize on it is a different question, but I think they'd better lower the prices of their low end macs, and they'd better do it soon.

4. In the words of Will Wheaton: don't be a dick. Stop suing everyone. It makes Apple look bad. Make things as good and positive for YOUR CUSTOMERS as you can. Push back with the media companies, push back with Google. Get the reputation of really, truly not being evil.

5. Look out for Microsoft. They're taking risks they have never taken before, and they have the habit of releasing real turds at first and then polishing them into good, well priced products. Apple, your low end tablets are too expensive. If Surface gets to be useable and Microsoft undercuts you, it'll be the mac thing all over again.

Anyway. My thoughts. Also, drivel on Raspberry Pi is quite useable. :)

"event","M and I have been thinking how Apple's entire platform design for iPad and iPhone falls apart in the face of usage caps and non-unlimited data. Prediction: Apple will either buy one of its providers outright, or will buy controlling interest in them and /force/ them to have unlimited data. My guess would be Sprint. With a total market cap of only 8 billion dollars according to YCharts, Apple could afford them easily. They're a national carrier, presumably with good ties to the bigger ones for roaming. Having one competitor with an absolute commitment to unlimited data would force the others into it in order to remain competitive. 

I also predict that the mac will not go away any time soon, though the laptops will continue to evolve to look more and more like an iPad with a keyboard. There are enough control freaks who don't want their data in the cloud and don't want all their software curated that Apple won't throw that part of their market away.

I predict that in a year or so's time, Apple's real competition in the tablet market will emerge. It will not come from a PC company. It will not come from Microsoft. It could turn out to be the Kindle Fire, and certainly it will resemble that platform in any case. My guess is it will come from a consumer electronics company. Sony would be my first guess, but they seem to have lost it as a design organization. Probably some company that's a startup right now will take the world by storm. Why not Amazon? I think their control freak tendencies on what you put on your kindle fire will bite them. After all, they're going for the non-curated, non-cloud, geek market, but they're trying to sell a curated, locked down product like Apple's, only with every possible corner cut to reduce cost.

In the post Steve Jobs mac world, I predict the product line will expand just a bit, and perhaps the midrange mac everyone's wanted for so long will finally emerge. Bigger and more powerful than an iMac, but smaller and less expandable than a cheese grater, I have no idea what this machine would be called. They could, quite reasonably, equip the mac mini with a couple card bays, including the video card, more memory slots, and a bigger power supply (video cards are pigs) and make it into that machine. Heck, they could make it cube shaped and call it the new cube.

People have been screaming for a less expensive, video game capable mac for years, and I think now will be the time Apple goes ahead and builds one.

"event","After something like 7 years of service, our old first generation airport extreme was flaking out every evening and losing its network connection, so we bit the bullet and bought one of the latest and greatest ones.

Once I had everything set up and configured - I just restored the configuration from the old router to the new one, plus set up the new features - we were getting really pathetic bandwidth on download, but normal bandwidth on upload.

Faced with that, it was time to track the problem down. First step: plug my desktop directly into the cable modem. Go to speedtest.net. Run.  Yow. 30mb/s.  Given that I pay for 16, that's pretty darn impressive, so the usual cause of my network problems - Comcast - was innocent.

Next, it was time to exclude the ethernet switch. So I plugged both our desktop computers' ethernet ports into the ports on the back of the new router. Same crappy bandwidth below 1mb/s.

At that point, it had to be a wiring problem, and I had jostled all the ethernet cables in our equipment shelf when I replaced the router, or a setting on the router itself. I checked the wires for kinks. (didja know you can squeeze 1000baseT ethernet off like stopping the flow of water through a hose by folding it in half?  Try it sometime, though if you get too enthusiastic, you can probably ruin your ethernet cable.) In this case, no serious twists or kinks availed themselves.

This left the router, and the ethernet wire between it and the cable modem, which I'd already checked for kinks.  I really suspected a router setting, so I started poking through them.

Checking the WAN port settings, I noticed (as I'd skimmed over it before) that the WAN port was set to 100baseT full duplex. Normal for any desktop computer. On a hunch, I set it to half duplex, and rebooted the router /again/.  (Come on, people, is it really so hard to make a consumer router that you don't have to reboot every time you touch the settings?  Cisco's been making those for 20 years or more.)  And bang.  30mb/sec all the way to our desktops.  

Moral of the story: Comcast's ARRIS Touchstone cable modems have half-duplex ethernet ports. Probably the old router was set to automatic detection, which is the default setting, but somehow in loading those settings into the new router they got changed. (It's possible I happy-fingered the setting. I haven't had much sleep this weekend.)  So if you're setting really crappy download rates, but normal upload rates, and you've just changed your router or the settings thereon, you may have a duplex problem.

Norm: First, let's make sure this is an RF prowblem. So what we're gonna do is wait until the trackpad is skipping, like it is now, then try moving it closah to the computer. 

Host: Wow, look at that. The problem goes away.

Norm: Cleahly an RF prowblem.  So we're going to have to open this computah up and fix it. But before we start, remember to read, understand and follow all the safety instructions that come with your tools. And remembah, there is no more important safety equipment than these, safety glasses.

Homeowner Jim: ""Tools?  Er...""

Norm: First, shut the computah down, using the shutdown command on the toolbah.  Then unplug the computer from the wall socket to make sure the logic board is really powahed down.

Norm: Next, take the side covah off the computer, and set it aside. We'll put it back on latah.  

Host: So what are we looking at, Norm?

Norm: This is the logic board of the computah. We don't want to damage it in any way, because they cost more to replace than the computah is worth.  Here, on the front side of the logic board, you can see the bluetooth module screwed into the board. Connecting to it is a wire to the antenna marked BT. 

Host: For bluetooth. That seems like it's okay.

Norm: It seems like it, but it's not. See, when this computah was made back in 2006, sometimes they labeled the wires from the antennas wrong, and the wire that's marked BT really should have been marked #1, which isn't used.

Host: So what can we do about that, Norm?

Norm: If you pull out the number two drive, that's second from the front of the computah, and look up at the front top edge of the logic board, you'll see all the unused antenna wires tucked up out of the way. Find the one marked #1. It's the only one long enough to reach the bluetooth module. Pull the plastic hose off the end. 

Host: Okay.

Norm: Now carefully unplug the wire marked BT from the bluetooth module. To do this, pull straight up, perpendiculah to the logic board. You'll feel it unsnap.

Host: Well look at that. It came right off.

Norm: Good. Now put the piece of hose over the end of the wire marked bt, then carefully plug the wire marked #1 into the bluetooth module, until it clicks.

Host: It's not clicking, Norm.

Norm: It takes a little finessing, but you'll feel it when it connects.

Host: Got it.  

Norm: Great. Now push the other antenna wires back up to the top edge of the logic board and tuck them behind it to make a neat job, then put the drive back in, put the cover back on, and plug it in.

Host: That's it?

Norm: That's all it takes. Y'know, Apple fights with these things all the time when people bring these machines in on Applecah. Sometimes they even replace the whole machine. But you can fix it yourself in about five minutes.

Host: Now would be a good time to blow all the dust out of the computer too, right?

Norm: It's always a good time to blow the dust out of the computah.

Homeowner Jim: Yow! It works the way it's supposed to, even when the computer's under load!

Host: What <em>is</em> that you're running?

Homeowner Jim: Er... I think I'd like to be alone now.

Host: Well there you have it. Until next time, I'm the host,

Norm: And I'm Norm

"event","Got a mac? Got photoshop CS4-Extended? Got a Space Navigator? Has your installation of CS4-Extended stopped responding to mouse clicks when the Space Navigator is plugged in?

Yeah, I had that happen too.

After corresponding with 3dConnexion's not-very-helpful tech support, I think I've stumbled on the cause and the solution. When you upgrade the OS, you need to open the 3d Connexion pref pane and hit the calibrate button. Why upgrading the OS borks the Space Navigator's communications with the Photoshop plugin, I have no idea. Why hitting calibrate unborks them, likewise, I have no idea. But it's worked twice now, and it doesn't seem to hurt anything.

"event","M loves her ipod mini. Really. She loves the form factor, loves how it fits in her hand, and it's an old friend. Over time we've replaced its battery once and upgraded it to a 16 gig flash drive (the drives in ipod minis are plain old CF devices, and are <a href=""http://geektechnique.org/projectlab/753/how-to-turn-your-ipod-mini-into-a-flash-based-ipod"">relatively trivial to replace</a> with modern, high-density flash devices. 32gb is now under $100.)  

So recently, when the click-wheel began giving problems, particularly in turning the mini off, it was a /bad thing/.  They're not a cheap part to find - the cheapest I found was <a href=""http://www.kingipod.com/ipod-mini-click-wheel.html"">$14.95 plus shipping at KingiPod</a> - a company I've never dealt with. Everyone else had them for closer to $50.  So we were seriously considering replacing the mini, reluctantly, with an iPod Touch, but it was always clear this was a second choice to keeping her mini.

So while digging around for the replacement click wheel, I watched the <a href=""http://ifixipods.com/media/mp4/ipodminiclickwheeltutorial.mp4"">tutorial on installation</a> to see if it was something I could do - didn't involve surface mount soldering, didn't involve a lot of specialized tools, etc. Turns out, it's typical ipod mini meatball surgery. No biggie.  Watching the video, though, I had a small brainstorm. Took the mini to the kitchen, took the bottom plate off and pulled out the clip.  And discovered the click-wheel cable was partly unplugged from the logic board. Once properly reconnected, everything works fine.

Go figure. So, the mini is back in service, where it will remain until it is utterly and completely dead. Total cost:  Nothing. :)

"event","Apple predictions for 2009. 

With Apple's announcement that they're not going to do Macworld after 2009's installment and that Steve Jobs isn't going to be attending Macworld 2009, I have some thoughts what will happen at Macworld.  

1. Phil Schiller will deliver the keynote. (duh. That's been announced.)
2. Phil will speak at length about iPhone, software sales, ipod, appleTV, etc.
3. Phil will deliver the ""and one more thing."" moment, and introduce Apple's netbook. I predict it will be called the macnet, or perhaps macbook mini. It will be substantially above 500 bucks, and may replace the last plastic macbook at $999. And while it would be nice if it ran full OS X, I would not be at all surprised if it ran the iPhone OS instead. If that's the case, I'll surely never buy one.

4. And this is a great big maybe.  Apple may abandon the ""mac"" product name. This might be another reason underlying the departure from the macworld show. 

The paranoid monkey in me also expects that the post-mac apple computer will be, like iPhone, locked in to software vending from apple, which would also contribute to why apple doesn't want to do Macworld anymore. Nah. Probably not.  But Mac is the *only* long-lived Apple trademark left. 

I think Apple is preparing an exit strategy for Steve Jobs in here, having Phil Schiller do the keynote, and I think they'd give him a cool product that Steve hates to announce. I think they *might* do away with the Macintosh trademark, but I have a hard time imagining they'd cripple their computers the way they did the iphone and ipod touch.

But then, I also predicted that they'd never embrace Intel processors. 

So we'll see.

"event","Okay, this one is in questionable taste, but here goes. If you are working with black poly sprinkler system parts, which the whole system at our new house is, you wind up pushing a lot of barb fittings into a lot of black poly pipe. Which takes a lot of force. The problem is, if you grease that with something, you could dissolve the poly tubing, or poison the lawn. If only there was a water based lubricant, available in small quantities, that was safe for the grass and for plastic pipe...

er...

There exist in this world ""personal lubricants"" which fit this bill exactly. They work perfectly. For plumbing use, thicker really is better.

"event","So I'm doing National Novel Writing Month (<a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">http://www.nanowrimo.org</a>) again. For the uninitiated, that's a 50,000 word novel blasted out in the month of November. <em>Looking Glass</em> started out that way, as did the space opera novel I've been working on lately.

I'm realizing that it's been about two years since the last time I stared into the screaming abyss of a completely blank page and started to fill it in with words, with story that even I don't know yet. It's coming. Slowly, as it always does in the beginning. I got about 330 words out today, mostly at the Nano write-in at the Highlands Ranch Tattered Cover. Hopefully more tomorrow.

I'm not actually behind. I schedule my Nano efforts to write 2500 words a day, Monday through Friday, and then take weekends off, so any words I get out this weekend are gravy for Monday's effort. If I can hit Monday warmed up, maybe with 2500 words to show for the whole weekend, I'll be far, far further ahead in the game than I usually start Nano. :)

Nano drafts, being about half-length, are usually very rough. I come out of them with a strong sense of most of my characters and a general idea of the plotline and the progression of the story. With <em>Looking Glass</em>, in revision, I tore out close to half the body of the Nano draft and rewrote or replaced the scenes, as well as adding some scenes and fleshing out a great many scenes. The space opera novel is shaping up the same way, or will be when I can get back to it.

<em>Irreconcilable Differences</em>, by contrast, did not start out as a nanowrimo draft. It took 3 times the time to write the first draft, but it was a much more complete draft, requiring comparatively minor work such as adding the prologue and reworking the beginning, much sharpening and clarifying of its complicated beast of a plot, cleaning up scenes that ran too long, and in some cases, amputating scenes all together to make the book's pacing work better. I'd love to say it was a much more pleasant experience editing it down into the finished novel, but because my life was such a mess last fall, and because I had to get the book in to the publisher by the top of February, it was a hard press against a hard deadline. On the other hand, had it been a typical Nano draft, it wouldn't have been possible to get it out this year at all.

For those playing the home game:

Hull #0: In 1990 or 1991, while I was in grad school, I set out to write my first cyberpunk novel. The effort fell apart after 10 or 15 pages of story and probably an equal number of pages of notes on the world. Grad school and chasing girls took up too much of my time. In the late 1990s, I cannibalized the world to flesh out North America for a Ghost in the Shell RPG campaign I was trying to put together with friends, which never materialized. Ultimately I couldn't leave the world alone, though. With its fractured United States, its nuclear powered, non-stop trains, its bio-punk focus and its bent toward smaller cities and towns in the West, it became the LookingGlass world with Hull #2, some 12 years after I originally thought it up. I recently found and OCRed a hardcopy of the Hull #0 story itself, and I have a deep itch to write this one at some point. I haven't touched it yet, but there are ideas from it that I haven't used that I keep stumbling over in my head.

Hull #1: The Steampunk novel. My 2002 Nano novel, then the longest creative piece I'd ever written. It's unlikely to see the light of day in any recognizable form, although I do like some parts of it, and might have to revisit steampunk and some variant of its world at some point.

Hull #2: <em>Looking Glass</em>. My 2004 Nano novel, after much revision and expansion. After the misery of creating a new world (research!) and a novel at the same time with Hull #1, and after reading Richard K. Morgan's <em>Altered Carbon</em>, which re-vitalized my tastes for both cyberpunk and first person storytelling, I wrote a novel that I thought played to my strengths. I recycled the world from Hull #0 and found myself telling a story from the point of view of Catherine Farro, PHD. Four days into this effort was the 2004 election. One may imagine it had some impact on her world.

Hull #3: After months of revisions to <em>Looking Glass</em> came this original followup novel. My 2005 Nano novel. Unlikely to see the light of day in any recognizable form. In my quest to find a different story to tell than <em>Looking Glass</em> I took on religious subject matter. I lost. This novel was also my first attempt at the buddy movie genre, which I found I liked writing, which probably explains the form that the next novel ultimately took.

Hull #4: <em>Irreconcilable Differences</em>. I began writing this one in January of 2006 after being pretty disappointed in how Hull #3 came out, and being absolutely clobbered by a better idea while driving across Kansas with my wife to visit her sister. Micki Blake and her world hit me all at once, so I started work on Hull #4 and never went back to its predecessor. The original draft was finished in September of 2006. It went to the editor in Feburary of 2008.

Hull #5: The Space Opera novel. I finished the first draft of <em>Irreconcilable Differences</em> in September of 2006, took October off, and began Nano 2006 exhausted, feeling like I was scraping the bottom of the barrel, and desperate, after 3 cyberpunk novels in a row, to write something other than cyberpunk. What emerged - and is still emerging - is a story about interstellar space travel in a universe without FTL, and about people and music and history. Still working on this one, sorting out the plot, refining the characters, making the timeline make sense, and sorting out the galaxy it's set in, the technology, and all the other fun of creating a new world/universe. :)

Hull #6: Cyberpunk again. Postcyberpunk. Whatever.  Very likely to be set in the LookingGlass universe, despite my intentions to the contrary. Changing the venue within the world seems to get me the change in texture I wanted without the headaches of creating yet another new universe and making sure my two cyberpunk universes were easily distinguishable. Very likely to, in the revision stages, cannibalize parts of hull #3. I don't know yet. It's all still in flux. I'm just meeting my narrator. :)

I'll try and post  from time to time about this year's Nano, but it's likely to be brief.

"event","Many years ago (probably high school), I discovered that the right tool for the job of removing oil stains from the driveway is kitty litter.  Cheap, plain clay kitty litter. Nothing new there.

What I discovered, though, was that it is most effective and fastest if you go out and rub the kitty litter into the pores of the cement driveway with your sneakers. In short, do a little dance on the kitty litter.  Takes about 5 minutes.  Then sweep the powdered kitty litter up.  That's all there is to it.

As a bonus, clay kitty litter also works as a traction medium, so if you keep the bag in your car, when you get stuck on the slippery snow/ice.

"event","In early June, my sister J was here, and we drove to Cheyenne to attend her son's graduation from East High School. (Congratulations, T). After that, we did something that I have failed to do in all the times I've been back to Cheyenne since my parents moved away. We drove by the house we grew up in.

If you get the chance to do that in your life, to visit the house that you remember from childhood nearly 20 years after the fact and after your parents have moved elsewhere, here's my advice.

Don't.

The first thing that struck both of us was that he neighborhood seemed awfully run down. It might always have been that way, I suppose. I wouldn't have noticed as a child. In my memory, the neighborhood is filled with sunlight, grass, and gravel. Not many trees, but a glorious alley to play in, incinerators to burn the garbage in, and so forth. The yards were enormous, too.  This perception was in no way diminished by mowing the yard of that house from the age of about 12 until I went off to grad school.

I remember the place always being fairly neat and clean. Houses being painted. Okay, it was the 1970s, so beige, green, and brown were the colors, but still. 

These are the facts I know about the old place. The house I grew up in was a 1950s rancher. Classic sprawl construction. It was about 18 years old when we moved in in 1972. About four years older than my current house is now. The old homestead is now somewhere in the vicinity of 50 years old, and presumably, so is the neighborhood. Houses don't last that long without careful preservation or occasional total overhauls. And 1000 square foot brick ranchers from the 1950s probably don't rate that kind of care.

It shows. Only one house in the whole neighborhood looked as well kept as I remembered, and my sister commented on it the same way. The house next door, which I always remember having a perfect lawn, perfect paint, perfect cleanliness inside, still has a perfect lawn and perfect paint. The only change I saw was the advent of a redwood fence in the back, doubtless so they didn't have to look across the alley to the dilapidated house across from them.  Which was dilapidated when I was growing up, too. Anyway.  My sister and I looked at the one perfect house and nodded to each other.  If the people who lived there when we were growing up are still there, they would do nothing less. We didn't stop to check. We were running short on time.

We drove down the alley. I haven't stuffed a car down that tiny alley since my original VW bug, the car I learned to drive on. I'm happy to say my New Beetle fit just as well.  The back yard of the old homestead seemed huge to me when I was little.  This was the yard I had to mow. This was the yard, the pet cemetery, home to the garden (long gone and sodded over now), the dog house (gone, and the dog is buried where it stood), the dog run and its concrete-footed guy wires (originally dug and then dug out and removed by yours truly).  Home to the jacuzzi, that I put the electrical box in for - my last foray into tampering with the house wiring. That project has been coming to mind a lot lately as I consider extending the basement electrical system in my current house.  I couldn't see, didn't think to look to see if that box is still there.

What was there was a yard I'd have never been allowed to let go that far. Junk. Toys. Ratty looking grass. The chain link fence my parents put in, after paying me to remove all the fence posts from the previous wood and wire fence, is now 30 years old or more, and it's drooping the way you'd expect. 

I'm glad we didn't have time to knock on the door. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I was thinking of a trite conclusion like, ""you can't go home again."" or ""let the place live in your memory"" but neither of those really covers it, and both of them imply that the old homestead remains a constant when it's not. Perhaps ""Nothing lasts"" would be a better conclusion. Change is the way of the world, and you ride it as long as you can. You don't actually leave anything behind. You just abandon it, and it goes its separate way, and you change separately after that. Your perceptions change, and the place you grew up in changes too. 

Or perhaps I just don't like having my sainted memories confronted with reality. :)

So. Let's raise a glass to the future, and let the past be the past.

"event","After the problems with Tiger when it came out, I wasn't about to pay for the privilege of beta testing Apple's operating systems again. I was content to wait until a couple revisions to 10.5 had been posted, and until most of the software I use had either been tried or updated to function properly with  Leopard.  I also wanted to get the novel I was working on done, just in case things went really, really bad.

So a week ago this past weekend, I finally took the plunge.

I think I made the right choice. Having all the hints for the ""WTF?"" moments out there already, as well as all the driver upgrades, some few software upgrades, and so forth was a huge help. It's not a seamless upgrade by any stretch of the imagination. If you take the plunge, you need to do some preparation.

1. Go through the preference panes you've added and make sure that all of them, all of them list their support for Leopard. This goes double if you're using any haxies from Unsanity, as they are only just releasing ApeManager and a few of the dependent haxies in leopard compatible betas, and if you have an old enough version of ApeManager, it will prevent your mac from booting at all under Leopard.  I never had much respect for Unsanity's stuff, so I wasn't using it, but M's machine is choc full of it. An experimental upgrade of a duplicate of her system with the beta haxies seems to work, though.

2. Do the archive and install. It's much, much cleaner, and you don't lose anything that I've found. I did the update on my desktop machine, and I keep running into little weirdnesses where files didn't get moved, one of which broke my desktop machine's web service to itself. One of those times when having the hints in place to fix the ""WTF?"" moments came in handy. I did the archive and install on my ibook (when the update failed to boot, probably because I forgot to sanitize my pref-panes (see #1 above.). No problems whatsoever. They have greatly improved the system integration for importing older systems. IMHO it's now more trustworthy than the update process.

3. If you are changing machines, use the ""import files from your old mac"" function. It works very well now, and your apps will (mostly) work.

4. If possible, do this beforehand, otherwise expect to spend a couple days having software tell you that it needs to be upgraded please. Also, OS X now asks if you want to run any app you downloaded the first time you run it. It gets annoying, but it's a useful security function, I guess.

5. Little Snitch is still your friend. But you have to upgrade to the newer version, and they charge you for that. And Little Snitch 2 seems to be completely unaware of Little Snitch 1's configurations, so you can expect it to bitch every time a network app touches the net for a while, just like it did the first time you got it. Annoying.

6. If you hate the ""3d"" dock, you can force it to look something like the old 2d dock with a terminal command. I recommend this. The ""3d"" dock looks like ass.  

7.  If you hate the translucent menubar ... there *are* hacks to fix it, but they introduce side effects that seem pretty undesirable to me. I left it alone, and I hardly notice it anymore.

8. If you have TWAIN scanner drivers that are left over from the PowerPC days (Thanks, Epson), you may have to set the applications that call them to run as PowerPC apps, too. If you're using ReadIRIS, you need to email their support people for an upgrade to the version that's supported on Leopard. Heaven forbid they should announce this, or make it available through the ""check for upgrades"" functionality. They're polite, and they'll get back to you, so I can't fault their support, but someone in that company's management is astonishingly stupid. I suggest finding other, better OCR software, if you don't already have it. Likewise, I suggest getting scanners from someone other than Epson. My Perfection 610 is working fine, despite outliving every other piece of equipment it was plugged into, but Epson's support for mac in general is pathetic. Go to a company that values your business, even though you have a Mac.

9. Time Machine is okay. It's nice to have delta dumps regularly. The interface is the usual overblown eyecandy (VMS managed to do the same thing with a ; and a version number) but it works, I guess. I haven't tried restoring anything yet, though.

The best feature of Leopard is deep in the guts of Unix. The scheduler finally makes good use of multi-core and/or multi-CPU systems and doesn't bounce a task around from core to core, wasting time and cycles for no good reason. All four cores on my Pro get busy now, and holy crap this machine is fast. Other than that, the only compelling reason to upgrade is the appearance of software that requires Leopard. The rest is just eye candy. For the speedup and the Leopard requiring software? I guess it's worth it.

Downsides:
Obviously the ugly-ass dock and the translucent menubar come here. Another downside is that software update now downloads by default in the background, so when it tells you there are updates to be had, it means RIGHT NOW, and it takes the system down to single user mode to install them. You can turn off downloading in the background, and I recommend it, if you're used to the way Software Update used to do things. It will still go down to single user mode to install. You'll discover this as you go from 10.5.whatever on the install DVD to 10.5.2, and again when you find out after installing 10.5.2, that there's a video subsystem update for 10.5.2. (Hint. Run software update again after you reboot into 10.5.2). Also, repair permissions takes about twice as long as it used to, and at present it complains about a couple of access control lists that it wasn't expecting, even when the disk is clean. I've read this is a bug in Repair Permissions, and all the machines I've upgraded show the same behavior, so I'm not worrying about it. Lots of little rough edges, generally, the kinds of things we've gotten used to not having in the double-digit versions of 10.4. Most annoying of these are the progress thermometers that don't seem to be in synch with anything, and sometimes don't change when they should, making it look as though the app (or system) has hung. Software update is a big offender here, too.

Overall, a mixed review, I guess. I'm comfortable with Leopard, and I've gotten everything to work on my system(s) without too much butt-pain. I'm just having a hard time finding anything really compelling about changing over, beyond the much-improved performance and Leopard-only software. And, of course, keeping my machine running the current, supported version of the OS, which is valuable in and of itself."

"event","For those of you also reading my <a href=""http://jamesrstrickland.blogspot.com/"">Pro Site Blog</a>, you've already heard this. For those of you who aren't, Flying Pen Press just released Looking Glass on Amazon Kindle. You can search for Looking Glass or James R. Strickland on your Kindle, or you can search for the ASIN: B0013FCU22 (Amazon's product number for Looking Glass - the Kindle Edition). Or you can, like, click <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Looking-Glass/dp/B0013FCU22/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=digital-text&qid=1201994195&sr=1-1"">here</a>.
 
The two versions are absolutely as identical as we could make them, which is to say the formatting is a little different (Kindle Edition formatted by yours truly) and I had to make some changes to make the Vietnamese words render something approaching properly. (Actually, if you read Vietnamese, they're probably wrong, but hopefully you'll still be able to figure out what the word is. It's not that important to the story.)

Formatting? A pain in the butt, frankly. Whatever Amazon says, Kindle's native format is a dialect of Mobipocket, which Amazon also owns. Mobipocket books are basically big HTML documents, written with a limited subset of HTML. Are you an old school purist, who likes your HTML all on one page without pesky includes and whatnot? You're in luck. That's how MobiPocket likes it. The official Mobipocket tools can convert other formats, of course, but they're all PC only, so if you're on a Mac, as I am, suck it up and generate the HTML. Make darn sure to confine yourself to the Latin1 character set, or it will bite you. Don't leave margins. Ebook readers don't have a lot of screen real estate, and at least the Kindle gets its margins by the stuff around the screen rather than on the screen. Next, go <a href=""http://guidoism.com/2007/11/creating-great-looking-ebooks-for.html"">here</a> and look up how to build the table of contents and the OPF file and set up mobigen to work in emulation. All that useful stuff in one easy-to-read place. :) 

Once you have the book built, (and tested, and tested s'more) upload the resulting .mobi file to Amazon's dtp.amazon.com site, fill in the blanks, hit Publish. What happens after that, I'm not sure. My publisher, Flying Pen Press, did the uploading, price setting, etc., and hit upload. All I know is sometime after that, the book will hit the Amazon Kindle store. It won't show up as another edition in the Amazon main page for your hardcopy books (Amazon's working on that, supposedly) Nor will your reviews for the hard copy show up in the Kindle store. And whether they accept your cover photo seems to be essentially random. The road to bleeding edge publication is not smooth, to be sure.

Whatever you do, DON'T feed Amazon's DTP site a PDF file. It barfs, vigorously, on almost all PDFs. It will automatically convert Microsoft Word files, kind of, but ONLY if they're from real versions of Word. Supposedly you can create the table of contents in Word, but I've not actually tried that. Stick to HTML and Mobipocket. The other advantage to doing the Mobipocket is that you can release the same book on Mobipocket stores for sale to people using mobipocket reader on their PDAs, cel phones, laptops, etc.

If I sound frustrated, I am, a bit. I spent a whole week on the Looking Glass Kindle project, and the majority of that was digging for the (nonexistent) documentation on Kindle's DTP site, digging for the (nonexistent) documentation for the Mobipocket format, wading through the (horrific) ebook standard that Mobipocket actually does sort of adhere to, and so on. The DRM got in the way a lot, and it significantly limits the usefulness of my Kindle, which annoys me greatly. There is absolutely no excuse for Amazon locking their own DRM format out of the kindle. None. But they did. Even the utility you can find online for grinding a proper mobipocket device id out of your Kindle's serial number produces a mobipocket device ID that won't work on Mobipocket's site. Other mobipocket servers apparently will accept it, so this is deliberate malice. Amazon? This sucks. Stop it.

Let me not sound unhappy with my Kindle itself. It's a nifty gadget. The functionality is very handy. It's a joy to read on the thing. Right now, I'm using it to review a draft of another novel, thus saving myself about an hour of laser printing (not to mention ten bucks worth of supplies, and that lovely laser printer stink.) Now if we can just get publishers up to where the recording industry has finally gotten - that DRM is more trouble than it's worth - and get Amazon to be less jerkish about DRM, maybe we'll have something. Until then, Kindle is the iPod of the print world, something Sony tried (and failed) with their ebook reader. Always good to see Sony fail. They copied Apple's DRM model as closely as they could. It annoys me, but then, DRM does that. It seems to be all DRM is actually useful for.

"event","After much personal angst, I've decided not to do nano this year, for the first time since 2003. Normally, <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">National Novel Writing Month</a> is my ""hope for the future"" - the time when, out of the whole year when I've been busy doing other things, that I get to write something brand new. But this year, the pressure of nano, on top of everything that's happened, was too much. So I bailed. It was the right thing to do, as things seem much better without the fact that I'm umpteump words behind on nano hanging over me. Hopefully things will have settled down enough by next year that I can do Nano once again.

So, you're asking, what's got me so stressed out?

Well, back in June, I published my first novel, <a href=""http://www.jamesrstrickland.com/lookingglass.html"">Looking Glass</a>. Prior to that was the mad scramble to get the book ready for release, so figure the craziness started in March or so. At the top of April, we had a trip to my stepfather's 80th birthday party, in New Mexico. My mother and stepfather, in turn, came to my book premier in June, which was much appreciated.

Anyway, in the middle of all of this, my father went into nursing home care for a short period for intensive physical therapy. It turned out he hadn't been eating well, and had lost about 1/4 of his body weight, which he could ill afford to do. In 30 days or so, they got him to the point where he could function on his own in his apartment again. Once he was safely ensconced in his own apartment, we went up to visit him. He wasn't well.

Then we moved.

This is still an ongoing clusterf***, as the old house has still not sold. But let me say that moving after 11 years of staying in the same place is very much harder than moving from one apartment to another was. The sheer volume of stuff, for one thing, complicates matters. You also miss the entrenched habits much, much more. The new place is in the Denver Metro area. The old place is in North-West Colorado Springs. Anyone want to buy a house?

While we were in the process of unpacking, my father decided that he'd had enough of living on his own, and began the process of signing himself up for permanent nursing home care. Meantime my dual G5 gave up the ghost with a logic board failure, necessitating a new computer, and much butt-pain migrating from the last of the powerPC mac workstations to a mac pro. Mostly things like, discovering I'd misplaced quite a few shareware registrations, having to upgrade versions on a lot of stuff to get them working with an intel mac, yadda yadda.

About the time this was winding down, about a week or so after he went into nursing home care, my father had a serious stroke, which wrecked the motor area of his brain. We went up to see him again, and to move him out of his apartment, as well as, via a power of attorney he signed into effect 3 years ago, to take control of his financial situation. This took three days, plus a full day's drive each way. When we left, he'd settled into the nursing home, with a good roommate, and things were vaguely hopeful that he'd recover more functionality as time went on.

When we got home, I made sure to make arrangements to donate his remains to science when the time came, as he requested of me some time before. I went with a company called <a href=""http://www.medcure.org"">Medcure</a> In exchange for the remains, they take care of transporting the body to Portland, processing the body to remove any tissues useful for medical research, and cremating what's left. They were extremely helpful and kind through the whole process and, as was my father's wish, it wouldn't cost any of us a dime.

We got home to the new house. On calling the nursing home, I found out my father was declining, apparently with a bout of what was probably pneumonia. Meantime, I discovered that the hot water lines were all producing very rusty water. I assumed this was a matter of mineral sludge in the tank. For want of something normal to do while I waited to see what the outcome with my father would be, I got a washing machine hose (that could handle the heat), coupled it up to the drain port on the water heater, and opened the valve to rinse out some of the sludge. Everything went well, until it came time to close the valve. Which wouldn't seal. Enter new water heater.

A day later, I got a phone call around 1:00am from the nursing home. My father had passed away. The death certificate suggests that, rather than dying of pneumonia, as I had assumed (which is why I was surprised, as he seemed to be getting over that), he'd had another stroke. All the paperwork was in place, and Medcure took care of him. We went back up to Sheridan to deal with his things, and close out his accounts, and have an informal coffee wake in lieu of a funeral. Essentially, M and I and some of his friends sat around drinking coffee, eating cookies, and telling Bob stories. This, I think, was what he'd have wanted. Kudos to Westview Healthcare Center in Sheridan for bending over backwards to help us out with this, providing the coffee and the room. Some of the staff who knew my father came to the gathering to pay their respects, as did my father's roommate, Joe. Of the coffee wake, I can say that I hope someone does as much for me. Much nicer than a funeral.

So, home once again. We're now toward the end of October. A week or so of decompressing, and we finally got our radon remission done (something we'd been meaning to get done since before we moved into this house). It took three days for the goop they sealed the basement with to dry enough to let the cats down there.

Halloween, and suddenly it's Nano time. And I tried. I got 45 words out, a good first couple lines of what I was planning as a total rewrite of my 2005 nano story. But the words just weren't there.

And that pretty much takes us full circle. 

Oh, I forgot to mention that during all of this, from the time Looking Glass hit the shelves, I've been supposed to be finishing Irreconcilable Differences, the next novel in the series with Looking Glass. That effort has suffered somewhat, as one might imagine, but at least I don't have *two* books hanging over my head right now. I'm hoping to get Differences in the hands of my editor by the end of this year, but we'll see how it goes. It needs a lot of work yet.

Things are slowly coming back together. I'm working on a deal to get some advertising for my novel, which I'll be paying for. I figure brand recognition (my name) is as important or more important than sales right now, and Looking Glass has been getting stellar reviews, so hopefully it really is just a matter of putting the book where people can see it. They'll see it. The place I'll be advertising is a well-known webcomic, and my skyscraper ad will be the brightest colored thing on the page, by virtue of being a slice of the Tim Lantz cover art. Yay for <a href=""http://www.stygiandarkness.com/"">Tim Lantz cover art.</a> :) We're all hoping we can use him again for Differences.

Conclusions, and life lessons learned.
First. From doing two moves back to back, let me say this: Throw stuff out. Please. For your own sake. Throw it out. Those screws that come with something you didn't actually hang on the wall? I know they're still good. Throw them out. They're cheap. Those of you who know me, and know how much of a slob I am, I'm sure this is a shock. But please. Throw stuff out.

Next, have your paperwork in place. This means a will, living will, and a springing durable power of attorney with authority to make medical decisions. Or however it's worded in your state/country/planet. Dealing with my father's stroke was hard enough as it was. The fact that he had all of those things in place, as well as having good documentation on how his financial system actually worked made it ever so much easier. The power of attorney meant that I had the magic keys to the kingdom, and could simply order things done in his stead, and they would be done. An added advantage became clear when dealing with the IRS. Since his official death certificate had not arrived yet, proving my father was actually deceased was a problem, and they were very much inclined not to let me check on his tax info without that, as they are *personally* liable if they release tax info to the wrong person. In fact, they were talking about requiring a court order, even with the death certificate. (The assumption is that any time someone dies, you have to appear in court to take over their financial situation. In the state of Wyoming, with an estate as small as my father's, this isn't necessary.) However, given the power of attorney and his will, both of which I did have, it wasn't necessary to prove that he'd died, as no matter whether he had or not, I legally did have the say. They called their information release people down, they took copies of all my documentation, and the information was released.

So. Power of attorney. Will. Living will. This last document meant that there was no question that my father did not want to be kept alive by heroic measures with his diminished quality of life. There was no question about tube-feeding him after the first stroke, when he was finding it hard to swallow. There was no question about signing a do-not-recessutate order after the first stroke. This was what he wanted, and he'd said so unequivocally long before the stroke happened. (He said so after the stroke happened too, but it would be possible to question the quality of his judgement at that point). Please folks. Have your documentation in place. Even if you have nothing worth inheriting, even if you just do a handwritten will (the will kits may not be valid in a lot of places, but handwritten ones apparently are). Do a will. And a living will. And a power of attorney. 

Third, the value of things. You have to understand that the value of any given thing is only what you place on it. One of the hardest parts of dealing with my father's apartment was making decisions on his behalf of what he valued and what he didn't. This became much, much easier after he died, since the question was reduced to, what do I value and/or what do I know friends and/or family of his would value that I can send to them? The treasures you store up, the book collection, the collectables, and so forth, keep them because you like them, but understand that when you're gone, a lot of it will be going to the land fill. Most of us don't have the kind of things worth making a museum for, and that's okay. But understand that this is the case, and don't keep things for posterity unless YOU like them enough to have them around. This relates back to throwing stuff out. You can also insert ""donating stuff to Goodwill"" if you prefer.

Anyway. At this point, you're probably wondering how I'm doing. (Or you're that bored, that you've read this far.) The answer: I'm doing okay. I'm still dealing with the fact that he's gone. I'm still dealing with the fact that this house is not laid out like the old one, and finding stuff is still a chore. Disappointed that Nano didn't work out this year. Annoyed that the old house is still for sale. But I think I'm coping. Picking my battles, I guess. Spending the energy I've got a little more carefully. There have been good things. And they're getting closer together.

Did I mention we finally found a good place to eat in Sheridan, WY, where my father lived? It's called Oliver's. Fine dining. In Sheridan. Alas, that we didn't find it years ago. But it was a good thing. Expensive, but worth it, after days of eating at Perkins.

Did I mention that the few people we've met in our new neighborhood are very kind and friendly? Jumpstarts in my driveway from strangers. A good thing.

Mile High Con was fun, too. I was on panels. Did a reading. I could get used to being treated as a contributor instead of just a con-goer. Good thing.

I'm swimming again, and back up to my full workout. Definitely a good thing. Just need to find either a personal trainer, or get involved with one of the martial arts schools within walking distance of my house. Good things.

So that's where I am.

Take care, all.

This morning, complications of that stroke (pneumonia)  ended his life. He was 79. I'll probably talk at more length about him in the future. 

Likewise, I'll probably talk about moving to a more urban environment (still suburbia in Colorado, but associated with a different urb, and a smaller house). And I'll probably rant, once it seems important again, about having to replace my dual G5 due to a logic board failure on a 3 year old computer.

"event","I downloaded the trial version of iWork 08 to try it. The short version: I'm not impressed.

The long version: Back when iWork came out (this would be iWork 1.0.x), I bought it strictly on the merits of Pages, since they advertised that it could read Appleworks files. After purchasing it, I discovered that Pages crashed on import of about one in four Appleworks text documents. Many bug reports, snide nastigrams, and negative reviews everywhere I could think of followed. Pages 1.0.x also failed to read most Word and RTF documents properly, and was essentially useless.

Fast forward to iWork 08.

Pages handles Word files well enough now, I guess, and the change tracking for word files is actually much nicer than Word V.x. It's all very pretty. I'm not a Word power user, so I don't have many complex Word documents to test Pages with, and in fairness, the complex Word documents I have dealt with don't always work on Word v.X. The complex documents I have tested seem to work. By contrast, Apple's own format, Appleworks 6 .cwk files, are still flakey, and Pages still crashes trying to import about one in four of them.

Numbers is wretched. Even simple spreadsheets take an eternity to import, and frequently are rendered incorrectly because numbers just throws away things it doesn't know how to deal with. Complex spreadsheets with macros are rendered so badly as to be incomprehensible.

Keynote: I don't use presentation software, so I haven't tested keynote.

Apple has managed to fix the installation problem where a newer (trial) version of iWork would render an older (licensed) version inoperable, as was the case with iWork 1 and iWork 2, but other than that, I can't see any improvements over the lame and nasty iWork 1.0 to bother spending money on the latest and greatest. I might be tempted for a sufficient upgrade deal, just to have the nicer-than-word change tracking, as this is something I use in my line of work extensively, but as is typical with the iWork product, there are no upgrades. If you want iWork, you pay full price.

Sad to say, I guess I have to wait until Microsoft releases Office 08 before I can get a better office suite.

As a brief aside, Word is not my word processor of choice. I do most of my writing in <a href=""http://www.nisus.com"">Nisus Writer Pro (and Express)</a>. My publisher has asked me to go to plain text with annotations when submitting drafts for typesetting, as the typesetting software's Word import functionality is even worse than Pages'. it boggles the mind, sometimes, how these pro software suites manage to coexist so badly."

"event","Now that I'm home again from visiting my father, I had the chance to try out iTunes +.  I downloaded the few tracks in my library that are from EMI (about $10 worth @ .30 a piece to upgrade the tracks), and I've been poking through them with my excellent Sennheiser HD280 pro headphones plugged straight into my G5.

The results?

To be honest, with most music, I can't hear any difference.

With <a href=""http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=147426385&amp;s=143441&amp;i=147426588"">Jose Gonzalez's cover of ""HeartBeats""</a>, because it is all guitar and voice, I can hear a slight difference in the dynamic range, a very faint increase in clarity, perhaps. Playing from my ipod in the car? doubtful. If I weren't sitting in a quiet room listening for the difference? Doubtful.

This does match up with my experiences with picking an MP3 bitrate. I settled on 192kbps VBR back in my BeOS days, after determining experimentally that below 192kbps VBR, I could hear the difference, but above it I couldn't. If memory serves, 128kbps m4p is supposedly as good a quality as 192kbps MP3, due to the higher efficiency of MP4 compression. It also bears out <a href=""http://www.maximumpc.com/article/itunes_256_vs_128_bit"">Maximum PC's article</a> on the matter, though I question MPC's methods a great deal.

Here's the thing. Rock music is typically not subtly produced. It's loud. It's freakish sounding. The engineers on it may have known how to do better, but the music they were working with didn't warrant it. Testing with rock music proved inconclusive for me as much as it did for them, as I expected. Jazz and instrumental music tends to be produced for audiophiles, so it has the subtleties that would challenge the format.

Also, Apple's itunes music store encoder may or may not be the same one they include with quicktime and/or iTunes, so the whole test MPC ran really isn't valid. Their results are true for their encoder, but one can't assume that they will hold true for Apple's ITMS encoding.

Still. Testing ITMS tracks, my results were similar. On very quiet, subtle music, in a quiet room, I could, barely, pick out the differences. Worth it? As I said, not for the music.

So while I support Apple's initiative to rid digital music of DRM the right way - coercing record companies to do the right thing with offers of money, I can't say I get anything more than a warm feeling for my extra pennies per track. Because my ears just aren't picking up a difference.

"event","For those of you not following my <a href=""http://jamesrstrickland.blogspot.com/"">other blog</a>, or my <a href=""http://www.jamesrstrickland.com"">author site</a>, a quick recap. A week ago today, May 25, 2007, Flying Pen Press, hereafter known as my publisher, had a Grand Premier party at The Tattered Cover, in Denver, CO. My first novel was one of two books introduced at that party. A good time was had by all. Well, as of today, the book is formally released, and is available from the usual suspects like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Looking-Glass-James-R-Strickland/dp/0979588901/ref=sr_1_1/002-7588879-9090421?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1180379056&sr=8-1"">Amazon.com</a>, <a href=""http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?WRD=james+r%2E+strickland&z=y&cds2Pid=9481"">Barnes and Noble</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Looking-Glass-James-R-Strickland/dp/0979588901/ref=sr_1_1/002-7588879-9090421?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1180737168&sr=1-1"">Borders</a>, although they're all listing it as a pre-order, still. As of today, it is available directly from <a href=""http://flyingpenpress.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=30&osCsid=354e0ee97fec363f21c68d11e571d375"">Flying Pen Press's Web Store.</a> I have a vague smile, despite being exhausted from a full day of yard work and a crappy night's sleep, so it must be a good thing. :)

"event","As I mentioned previously, my <a href=""http://www.jamesrstrickland.com"">author site</a> is the first website I've done with Cascading Style Sheets. Having done so, and having  climbed the learning curve, I have to say that I like CSS. Once you have that style sheet built and working, it's a whole ton easier to make the site consistent across pages, to lay the same header and footer on every page, and especially to modify the pages. Want to change the content? Change it. The style sheet will format all the new stuff right, providing you connect the new stuff up to one of the styles. Even if you don't, the default rules will apply. Want to change the look? Change the style sheet. All the existing content will reformat to the new style.
Cool beans.

Now some day, I have to go ahead and redo all of Litterbox.com with style sheets.  But don't hold your breath. The place works with all its HTML tables, and I just don't do that much maintenance on it.

Oh, if you haven't been to the author website, or haven't waded through all the tags, there's a blog there with somewhat more interesting (I think) material than me nattering on about dolls and macs.  <a href=""http://jamesrstrickland.blogspot.com/"">New Blog Here</a>.  It's also got RSS feeding, if you're so inclined.

"event","In order to have an author photo for my aforementioned novel, I went to JC Penny's to get my picture taken.  It was the first formal portrait I'd had taken since high school graduation. The photographer was very helpful, and got a number of reasonable shots of me. (I'm not very photogenic.)

After that, the process degenerated into idiocy.

First, despite the images being taken digitally, there's a <strong>ten day </strong>delay between when the pictures are taken and when you can access them online.  Why?  Because they have to burn the photos to a DVD and snail-mail the DVD to Virginia, where the smilesbywire people, whoever they are, eventually get around to putting it online.

So okay, it's ten days later. Sure enough, my pictures are there.

Picking through the images, I found the one I wanted.  One that I wouldn't be too embarrassed to have in the cover of my book. (I'm really really not very photogenic.) Tried to download the image. All I could get is the 250x312 preview image.  That's not enough resolution. So I called smilesbywire and asked them how I could get the larger image.

""You can't."" was their reply.

The hell?

It turns out that the only way I can get a high resolution image out of them, remembering that this is a digital process from end to end, except for the part about mailing DVDs around, is to have them print the image and send it to me, a process that somehow takes another five days.

This, despite my photographer assuring me I could get the RAW images for my own processing.

But wait, there's more!

While having the picture taken, I filled out the paperwork to get the rights to reproduce the image in support of my novel. Turns out that I don't *get* those rights until, you got it, I have a print made. Yes, you read right, I can't even use the charming 210x320 preview image they will let me download without buying a print that will take another <strong>five business days</strong> to reach me.

So I'm only out 16 bucks, so it's not worth getting really pissed off about, except of course that I've waited too long already for images I can't use at all. I'll wind up doing what I should have done in the first place: have M shoot pictures of me, and Photoshop them until I'm happy.

The upshot:  Penny's may be great for sending pictures to grandma, but they are ENTIRELY USELESS for any more serious portraiture. If you're looking for a portrait you might actually want to, you know, use, especially in a reasonable amount of time, Penny's is not the place to go."

"event","Some of you, most of you, may be aware of my secret other life as a novelist.  Well, my publisher has finally taken the wraps off the first project, and at long last, I can talk about it here. :)

First, <a href=""http://www.litterbox.com/jim/temp/PressRelease.pdf"" title=""Link to the press release"">The Press Release</a>. (I tried to embed the PDF in my LJ page, but for reasons I have, as yet, not worked out, it refused to do so, despite doing so just fine several entries below.)

Anyway, for those not PDF-enabled, the press release is announcing the premier of 4 books from <a href=""http://www.flyingpenpress.com"" title=""link to www.flyingpenpress.com"">Flying Pen Press</a>, hitherto and hereafter known as ""my publisher"".  Among them, in fact, first in the press release *yes!* is Looking Glass, my novel.

For those of you just tuning in, Looking Glass began its journey to publication as my 2004 NaNoWriMo novel, then known as /dev/ice. It has since undergone a lot of revision and expansion to a full sized, 90,000 odd word novel.

My blurb for it goes like this:

<span style=""font-family:Times;"">In the year 2025, Dr Catherine Farro is forty years old.  She is alone.  She lives her life online.  She works days in a virtual reality tank as the leader of a network management and security team for a large discount store chain.  Her career is stalled.  Her life is stalled.  And she's running late.  It's Friday, payday, and she and her team are anticipating the weekend.   Fourteen minutes later, only two of them are left alive, and Cath Farro dives onto a collision course with a malevolent hacker known as LookingGlass.  Her quest for justice and revenge will cost her her job, and force her from her quiet, virtual life into a maelstrom of intrigue, death, emotion, and memory: the real world.  Even if she survives, her life will never be the same.  Some days it just doesn't pay to get up.

(Imagine that read by Don LaFontaine, </span><span style=""font-family:Times;""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJMGS7l0wT8"" title=""link to YouTube"">That Announcer Guy from the Movies.</a></span><span style=""font-family:Times;"">)

The book's not for sale yet.  It's set to go on sale June 1, at which time you may assume I will put a link to Amazon to order it here in my LJ. Also, watch this space. I have a new website coming. :)

"event","Thought of a new question this morning in my long running, and hitherto undocumented, ""weird questions for my vet"" series.  The first three questions were:

1. ""Does a cat have a bellybutton, and if so, where?""  After much groping of the cat, neither the vet nor I could find it, but we assumed it was there.

2.  ""Oreo's tail is extra long. Does he have extra-long tail vertebrae, or does he have more tail vertebrae than normal.  The vet responded that it could be either one, but probably wasn't worth an x-ray to find out.

3. Given that vets frequently use human medicine, why is human healthcare so very much more expensive than pet healthcare? The vet's answer was that she didn't know, but that her husband, a racehorse vet, payed as much in malpractice insurance as an OB/GYN, so it wasn't that. The answer appears to be complex, partly due to heavy regulation, partly due to price inflation (your insurance company, should you have one, never pays full price for your treatment), and partly because ever person who pays for care is carrying along two or three others who don't. Insert long rant about the need for national health insurance here.

And the new question is:

3. ""Since most cats are neutered/spayed, do cats get  osteoporosis? If not, why not?

My guess is that they don't live long enough for it to be a problem. In humans, where the condition occurs in females after menopause, it takes 20-30 years to become serious. Cats make it to 20 only if they're extraordinarily lucky, and by then they're so feeble that their bone strength is not a major concern. I may be wrong, of course, as cats' body chemistry is rather different from old-world apes, of which we are one species.

But I have to ask my vet. :)"

"event","Picked this meme up from <a href=""http://www.duntemann.com/february2007.htm#02-04-2007"">Jeff Duntemann's Countra-Positive Diary</a>  It's about what TV made the biggest impression in your life. 

Looking at my own TV timeline, there are some interesting things.  First, I watched a whole ton more tv than Jeff did, especially at a younger and more impressionable age. 

Second, I have two peak periods when TV made the biggest impression, rather than one.  The first is approximately 1976-1977, right around 30 years ago, when I was about 10.  The second is around 1986, the year I graduated high school, though it's a much less pronounced peak.


<img src=""http://www.netfossil.com/jim/temp/tv timeline.pdf"" />

Some Notes: No, I did not start watching TV before I was born. Obviously. It's damn hard to see like that. I've put these shows in the years they were in their original broadcast runs, because that's where they are culturally, but I undoubtedly saw many of them in eternal reruns on KWGN-TV Channel 2 out of Denver. Certainly this was the case with Star Trek, which is the first TV show I remember watching, and with The Wild Wild West. I was undoubtedly re-watching the shows from when I was 10 all the way through high school.  And I really did stop watching Sesame Street long before 1993. :)  Also, obviously, I didn't stop watching TV in 1993, but it seems as though TV after that hasn't made a big enough impression to remember."

"event","Some time ago, I realized I was missing a bunch of old documents, dating from my PC days - which would be pre-2001 - were missing.

After an extended search, rooting through old floppies and hard disks that have been languishing in the junk box for years, after finding lots of other interesting stuff, I'd given up finding the one thing I was really looking for; fragments of  the first novel I ever tried to write.  This file dated back to about 1991-1992, and would have been written with Norton Textra Writer.  I have Textra running in DOSbox on my mac, but the novel fragments eluded me.  Which was vaguely annoying, since LookingGlass and the two novels in various stages of completion that come after it, cannibalized that novel's world and are, in essence, inheritors of that novel.

And then it occurred to me.  Paper.

I used to keep paper printouts of everything of value, specifically because I expected hardware to fail, disks to get lost, and so forth.  

After some digging in the file boxes in the basement, I found the one file folder that might have it.  And, lo and behold, there it was, the majority of the bits and pieces of that long ago novel attempt, all printed out in daisy wheel print on tractor feed paper.  I don't know when that printout was made, as I had that printer from the time I graduated high school until after I moved to California, but somewhere in there, I spent the time (at 80wpm, the speed of a good typist) to print the thing out, and now, 15 odd years later, there it was, battered but readable.

From there began the adventure of OCRing it into my current computer.  Let's just say that it might have been faster to just retype the whole thing, although the urge to change it, fix it, good grief, just throw it away might have been overwhelming.  It nearly was, just making the OCRed version readable.  

Uh, yeah.  I remembered these fragments being better.  Sure, there are some good ideas, in my humble opinion.  And yeah, you can definitely see the roots of today's writing in it.  Little bits of environment, little bits of characterization, the fascination with characters who aren't young, athletic, and pretty (with notable exceptions), and my oink-headed desire to set cyberpunk in the places that I'm from - Wyoming, Colorado, etc - are already clearly in play.  All of these I've recycled into my current arc of novels, and much of it is carrying forward into my experiments outside that arc.

Will this Opus 0 novel ever see the light of day itself?  I have no idea.  To say it would need a total rewrite is overstating what it is: 4000 or so words,  a few scenes, some character sketches, random ideas jotted down for future reference.  The world file that used to accompany it is long gone too, though I cannibalized all the good stuff out of that long ago, and still have the derived works, and of course, I refined that world dramatically for the present work.  Likewise, I've cannibalized characters - or at least character names too.  But this story?  I don't know.

Still.

It's good to see it again.  Warts, bad typography, horrific spelling, and all.  It's good to see it.  Good to have it back in digital, where I can work on it, some day.  Maybe.  We'll see.  Depends on how desperate I get, come November. :)

"event","When the snow has built up and lain long enough that you have 4 inches of solid ice over your sidewalk, the snow blower isn't going to touch it.  A hoe will, until you destroy the head taking long swings.  The same goes for that cheap rake.  A shovel will, with enough battering, until you blunt the edge and/or destroy your hands absorbing the shock.  

The right tool for the job turns out to be a mattock/pick.  One of <a href=""http://www.northerntool.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_6970_200325131_200325131"" title=""mattock pick"">these</a> more or less, save that mine has a fiberglass handle, and came from Home Depot.

Well . . . yes.  But M. helped me by shoveling the ice away once it was loose, and we got it done.  Finally.

"event","Way back in July of 2005, I suggested that Apple would do some kind of convergence device, and that the widget paradigm was really for something other than OS X's desktop.  Looking at the iPhone, I think I was right on both counts.  We'll know more when they're released, of course, but it looks sufficiently cool.  Interesting that, according to Steve Jobs' presentation on the iPhone, they started work on it in the 2004-2005 timeframe.  So I called it right, just . . . early. :)

Way back in May of 2006, when Apple said farewell to the iBook line and name, I said I'd probably buy a macbook some time.

As it happened, that time was today.  As I started digging into editing one of my novels, the iBook's inability to keep up with my typing in the middle of an 80,000+ word document finally, finally got on my nerves too much to wait anymore, and I picked up a 2ghz Core 2 Duo White Macbook today.  Uh, yeah, it's our second, since I got M. a core2duo of her own for Christmas.  Hers is black.  She always loved the black powerbooks, and never cared a lot for the white iBooks, so.  So.  

The powerbook we had (Pismo - g3/500 Firewire) will be going on consignment at my local mac dealer, assuming it passes inspection, which I expect it will.  It's priced to move, too.  M's macbook replaced this machine.

My iBook has also, thankfully, found yet another new home (it was given to me) , and hopefully will give its new owner more years of service.

Oh yeah.  And it's snowing again.  /AGAIN/.  I like snow as much as the next guy, and of course, it's drinking water on the hoof, but guh.  Could we have a week or two break, please, to let what's here melt?

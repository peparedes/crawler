"event","So, this weekend was a real eye opener. I was at my church retreat and it was a nice break. I was able to get away and focus on me. I haven't written in my journal in a long time and I filled 6 pages this weekend. The speaker was amazing. It was as if he looked inside me and knew exactly what I needed to hear. It was if it was only me and him in the room. I need God to start defining my life. When I die what are people going to remember me for? Are they going to remember me for the things I've done or are they going to remember me for the spiritual and godly things I've done? Lately I've been more focused on the earthly issues and I've forgotten that what I obtain here on earth isn't going to matter in the end. I want to leave this earth with spiritual value. God is the only one who can make me last forever. Yea, so I cried a lot this weekend. God was just totally putting things on my heart. I won't get into it here, but just know that I am not going to let this weekend become a ""mountain top experience.""

I also learned I need to weed out a lot of the voices in my life. I need to start going to people with wisdom with my problems. Sometimes I need to just shutup and listen for God. I don't need to do all the talking. I need to seriously humble myself. I need to start focusing on God. Everything I do I do through him, none of it is done on my own. I am not lonely. the void I feel doesn't need to be filled with someone, it needs to be filled with God, then he can point me in the direction he wants my lief to go. Until I am content with him, he's going to let me run around like a chicken with its head cut off. I learned a lot of other stuff too, but this is what he's really put on my heart. God is amazing, yes he is.

Ok, this weekend wasn't just serious god talk, it was a lot of fun. It started with going up early on friday. Since it was raining the snowboarding was cancelled and we went to I-Hop for lunch. That was fun. Then we went to the camp and helped them set everything up. The busses were scheduled to leave the church at 2-230 and would be up at the camp at 530-6. Well, this was a North Coast adventure so of course things never go as planned. We wanted to go see Hitch at 430 but it depended on what time the busses were really going to make it up if we were going to be allowed to go or not. Well, at 415 they were still in Temecula so we got the go ahead to see the movie. It was hilarious. All I can say is:

Start the fire, start the fire, start the fire, start the fire, and make the pizza, make the pizza, make the pizza, make the pizza, and q-tip and q-tip and throw it away, throw it away, and crab!

After the movie people had messages from people on the bus. One of the bused side-swiped a car and took off it's rear-view mirror. Later the second bus slid on a patch of ice and hit the guard rail, luckily they weren't going fast at all when it happened. They were at teh dam at Big Bear Lake and had to put on chains and it was found out that one of the buses didn't have chains. So the one bus got the chains on and made it to camp. The suburbans that had carried us up earlier all went down to the other bus to shuttle people from the other bus to camp. It was about 1030-11 before everyone made it to camp. I went to bed at around 11 and was woken up at 130 by girls running down the hall and the sound of snow hitting the dorms. Stupid girls can't stand a little snow. I was able to go back to sleep and was once again woken up by giggling at 6am. 6 freakin am. I didn't have to be up until 8. stuuuuuupid! Well, breakfast and then another meeting and such and then we had freetime. I went sledding and made some new friends. I ate it a couple times. I didn't have any snow pants so I was in my jeans which somehow stayed pretty dry. Well, the worst wipeout I had was with this guy Dan. We went down double on the innertube and hit a huge bump and he ended up flying off and I ended up being dragged on my back. It was fun. The worst wipeout of the day however was when four girls piled on the innertube and they hit dirt. the tube stopped but they didn't. They were all hurting. They flew a good ten feet from the tube. Luckily the only injury was bruises. After that was dinner and then another meeting. Worship was amazing! Then I went to bed at about 1 and woke up at 730. I packed we ate breakfast, had a short meeting and then started cleaning the camp. The buses left before us and on the way down we saw one of the buses on the side of the road. The driver was the same one who forgot the chains and sideswiped the car. He totally burned out his brakes. We followed them down the mountain, stopped for food and then the people I was with dropped me off at home. It was a great weekend and this doesn't even begin to cover it. Great quotes of the weekend:

""I think I just threw up in my brain."" -Renee

""Hey you guys, am I wearing my shirt?"" -Shakata

""Watch out, I think she just snorted brains out her nose."" -Kneeland Brown

Phase Ten with a Yugio twist.

""I lay down two cards facedown and place a 2 in the graveyard."" -Carlos playing Phase Ten

""By the power of Gray Skull I have the power."" Kneeland Brown talking about his Heman sword.

""Do you believe in the heart of the cards?"" -Phase Ten players

""No see, she's Jenny with an enny; but she's Ginny with a G"" -Blake

Man, there were so many more but I can't remember. It was a weekend I will not be forgetting for a long time! I can't wait for Oasis and then Mission Impossibe which I will be able to go to this year since I'll be able to take time off. I don't care if my boss gets mad. Ok, I've done enough writing for today. I hope to talk to you all soon!

"event","Ok, my German class is freakin awesome. First off, I love my teacher like no other. He is so funny and laughs at my jokes. The other day, we were talking about nouns like fish and beer and rice that seem like they should be plural but they are considered singular. Well, to give us another example he said:

""For example you wouldn't say, 'I like pea.'"" 

But see, when he talks, you don't know which pea he was talking about so of course, laughter filled the room. He tried to explain he meant ""pea"" and not ""pee"" but come on now, we are college students. hehe. Later in the class in another example he said:

""Now, you also wouldn't say, 'You have how much pea?'""

The answer to that was, ""It depends on how much beer you've had."" Now I could have used this and laughed the entire class period. I don't know what I found so funny but it was hilarious. Later in the class though we were translating english sentences into German:

Teacher: ""English.....German.....they're not the same language.""
Class: (sarcasitcally) Wirklich?!? (really?!?)
Teacher: ""Ya, wirklich""
Me: Quatsch! (nonsense!)
Teacher: (laughing)"".....quatsch.....""(more laughing)(dead serious) ""Ya""

Man, I love this class. Here are some more random qutoes.

Tansy: This class always makes me want to drink.
Me: Maybe it's because we always answer everything with beer.
Tansy: Maybe, but I want a real beer, not the one he squiggles on the board.
Me: I don't know, I've heard chalk beer isn't that bad.
Tansy: (gives me weird look) Yea, you would have heard that.

Random Classmate (RC): I love you in German class.
Me: Me? Really? Why?
RC: Because you're funny....
Me: ....looking....
RC: ....yea, that too.

Me (to teacher): You might get my sister in the fall.
Teacher: And is she as genius as you?
Me: No.
Teacher: Ok, I'm going to tell her that. (pretends like he's talking to my sister) Hey, I have your older sister in my other class and she says you're dumb.

HAHA. I love this class. I recommend to anyone interested or already going to CSU San Marcos to take German with Professor Hughes. He is hilarious and you learn at the same time. Who could have thought that was possible?!?!?!?!?!"

"event","Ok, so it's only been like ages since I last updated this thing. Goes to show how much of an interesting life I lead eh? Well, I seem to be hanging out with Mr. Zenns and Nay Nay a lot. I consider us the three stooges, though when we're together, we do seem to have some intelligent conversations...in between all the stupid inside jokes and us just being idiots. Those two are a blast to be around, makes me happy. Hmmmm....other things to talk about...not much. Next week is the last week of the semester wo0t! so excited. I hate school with a passion. A burning passion that is fed each time I am made to walk up the millions of stairs to my next class. Next semester hopefully will be better since I'll finally be taking classes related to my major (which I finally changed)! Yep, i will be in accounting and economics. Hopefully not too hard. I will also be taking German 201...fun fun! I love my german class! And i think i will be taking a history class (with people i know) and possibly another theater arts class. Not sure yet about the later...maybe some type of music class. There is one about the history of regee that seems to me like it'd be pretty interesting. we shall see.

Well, it is off to German class now. I must take a test on adjective endings and the reflexive forms....I might want to open the book just this once to make sure I remember this stuff...I so love having had four years of german...makes these classes pretty chill...and guess what! Next semester I'll finally be learning something new! Yippy!

"event","Well, this weekend was soooo much fun! I went on a leadership retreat with about 45 other people from our college ministry. We went up to Crestline. On saturday we planted trees and raked out all the leaves from around the cabins...becaue they are a fire hazard. Well, saturday night during worship someone came and told us it was snowing. Well, this early in the season at such a low altitude we thought it was pretty cool, but that it'd be gone in the morning....yea, we were wrong. When we woke up on Sunday there was two feet of fresh powder everywhere the eye could see. One of the people from the camp told us that there was no way we were going to be able to drive home....which meant....we were snowed in! yes we were. unfortunately, no one was prepared for snow. we were told that it hasn't snowed before Thanksgiving at the altitude we were at in 10 years, and it's been about 5 since they've gotten so much snow in one night. we still had a great time. we had a surprise b-day party for one of the guys and put on the ""Snowed In 2004 Talent Show."" It was awesome! one of the guys from down here drove up with a bunch of chains at 930 sunday night so that we could get home today. when he was leaving, his front end slid and a bunch of us went to help him get otu.....at 1am. Then today...monday....we woke up and at 8 they told us we had to get out ASAP because there was another storm comming in. It took three hours to get all the cars dug out and to get chains put on the car. then we all took off at about 1130 and got home at about 130. all in all it was a great time and i would soooooo do it again...this time with a snow jacket, boots, and snow pants. hehe.

"event","O gosh, last night was the greatest. Let's just say it was totally a night of sweet action! Nay Nay and I went on a ""where's paul"" hunt. It was his birthday today/yesterday, the big 2-0. Talk about sweet! We called his cell and left 74327281327 messages on his phone and then called his house (sorry to paul's sister). He wasn't answering his phone and his said had said that he was at church, which he wasn't cuz that's where we were calling from. Well, we decided to drop off his cards at his house so I asked a friend for directions and off we went. We stopped at a 7-11 and got a bunch of pink stuff that ranged from Sweet-N-Low packets to Sqeeze-It to Skintamate. We left that on his front door and decided to go find window chalk and suran wrap for his car. Finally as we were getting suran wrap to wrap his car (which was at his house) he called and told us that he had been sleeping. Well, we returned to his house w/o the suran wrap and kidnapped him instead. We went to In-N-Out, then to the O'Side Pier, and then just randomly drove. Sooooooo much fun kiddies you don't know. I don't think there was a point in the night where I didn't have to pee my pants due to laughing so hard. We also had much fun quoting lines from monty python [holy grail], elf, various will ferrell skits [timber, axis of evil], and MISS SWAN!!! Below are just a few of the random quotes said throughout the night. These are 100% original. When I say a few, I mean that this is like 0.1% of the randomness....no joke.

""so that's how i get attention [from guys]...i wear pedro on my shirt."" -ginny

""my love for you is like diarrhea...i just can't hold it in."" -paul

""my dad gave me a birthday card like a normal dad would give his gay son."" -paul

""thank You."" -paul thanking God for his food

""he's marrying his neice? is that legal?"" -renee

""i'm surprised i could run with that backside [immitation of a dog]. it was like dragging on the ground."" -paul

""i have tourettes!"" -renee

""when we were driving to ohio, there was a petrified forest...it was beautiful."" -paul

""i watch a lot of movies."" -paul

""i had fun. we talked dirty."" -paul

""that's what she said."" -paul quoting an inappropriate line from a movie

""i want fish."" -ginny

""you guys seriously. if you're gonna kill me and bury me, at least rape me before you do."" -paul

[slanting his eyes and bowing] ""HERROOOOO!"" -paul saying ""hello"" in ""japanese"" to his grandma

Yes, most of the quotes are from Mr. Zenns, but it was his b-day for heaven's sake!

<3 ""Renee we're breaking up....Paul, you're my new date."" ""Who said"" ""I did"" ""How's that"" ""Because I'd so rape you if you were about to die"" ""Ok, you passed the test"" -me and Paul after Renee blurted something out that thankfully wasn't heard, but which caused me to have to change my date from her to Paul for the rest of the night.

Not only is it a road trip however, it is a diet as well. To save on food we are going to be packing a lot of our own food and going to grocery stores when we need more. If any of you guys know of any cool places to stop on the way to San Fran tell me cuz we're looking for cool things to do. It's going to be a nice trip w/no drama and major bonding for me and fellow Car Pirate Claude. Gonna be a bomb arse trip! O yes, if you know of anything fun in/around San Fran be sure and tell me. We have a whole week and a half!

I'm so excited! It's gonna be soooooooooo much fun.

"event","Ok, so this Halloween totally beat out last years. Honestly, I can't even really remember what I did last Halloween. So yea, I went to my church's Halloween Bash. I went as a battered cowgirl...mainly because I had no time to really change much. So I went to church, helped set up then went over to a friend's house and I got my make-up done. I got a black-eye, a scrape, bloody nose, and a scar that ran from my top lip to my bottom lip. Most of the night people were taking bets as to whether the wounds were fake or if they were real and I made the costume to go with the wounds. It was great....and yet I didn't win believability. O well...To add to this story I start with today. I didn't wash off my make-up last night so this morning I went in to wash off the make-up and I looked in the mirror and the eye looked so real. Not wanting to ruin such a work of art I washed off everything except the black eye. So I went to school with the make-up on and people kept asking me what happened. So the story went that I got smashed inbetween a horse and a panel of the pipe corrall saving a child in the process...basically the story is that the horses got too close and I saved the child...which has had to happen many times....just not with the results being a black-eye. So yes, it was much fun. All of my teachers were asking what happened and if it hurt and fun stuff like that. I'm keeping it on for bowling tonight too....I want to see if anyone realizes that Halloween was yesterday and that it could just be my lazy self not wanting to take it off. I'm sure the ladies on my team  will figure out that it's just make-up. But it's still going to be fun!

O yes, the whole ""George"" thing....over it. Done. Back to just going where the wind takes me. O well, there are many other fish in the sea, o yes they are.

This weekend was mucho fun. Even though I only saw my wrangler girls from afar it was enough until Winter Camp! I luvers you girls!

"event","I have finally given it all to God. Yep, the whole situtation with him (for LJ purposes I am going to call him ""George"") is out of my hands. It's all in God's court, just like he's wanted it from the begining. Yay for Ginny! I love the drive to the ranch, just me, God, and whatever music i've got going. It's the perfect time for me to just talk with him. I just had a revelation this morning. Looking at everything he's created and how perfect everything is and realized that all he wants is for me to give all my problems and worries to him. He doesn't want me to have to worry or anything, he wants me to live the life he put me here for and to enjoy it. I've just been so caught up in not burdening him (isn't that stupid, hehe) that I forgot why he sent Jesus. It's so freakin simple that I can't believe it took me this long to finally see it all so clear. Honestly, it was the first time that I've given something to God and truely felt as if it was gone. I mean, I've given things to him befor to take them back like a day later, but this time, it's gone. Anything that happens now is because God wants it that way, not because Ginny is going to force it to happen like in the past. It just feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I mean, there are still things that are hard to give completely to God, but the situation with ""George"" is completely in God's hands. Man, a situation involving a guy and I gave to God. One of the hardest things for me to give up and I did and I'm actually leaving it alone. For once I am sitting back and am going to enjoy the ride God has instore for me. If I come across any rapids instead of back paddling and taking the easy way through, I'm jsut going to hold on and ejoy it. What doesn't kill me will make me stronger right? I am looking forward to seeing what God has instore for me. Just pray for me to keep my eyes on God and for me to have patience. That's all I need. All I've ever needed. Yea, I hate feeling lonely, but I've finally started living like I'm not alone because I'm not. God is always with me, no matter what. He's not the type of person to leave me when things get hard, instead he stands infront of me to fend off the blows meant for me. Who needs anything else? Not me! Though wanting something else is a totally different story. hehe

You'd have no worries, the only thing you'd have to worry about is if you were the sun/star and if it was time for your light to go out. But then you'd go knowing that you helped light up a whole world and the things you'd helped create in your lifetime would be awesome. I've always been very intrigued by the stars. I could spend hours just laying outside and staring at them. I wish that I could just live a carefree life. A life like a star, where people looked up to me, could spend hours just staring at me, talking to me, wondering about me. I wouldn't have to worry about anything. It'd be sooo nice."

Things are going, my small group is great, i'm glad i decided to join that instead of a second bowling league. all the people in it are awesome! Smitty has left for Texas and I didn't get a chance to say bye...that really sucks. My mom and sister came down this weekend to check out the college for my sis. It was good to see them again. I'm going home for half the day on the 7th to watch her play tennis. Three years she's been playing and I'm just now going to actually see her play. I miss that kid, not like I don't talk to her, but her crazy friends and stories....fun stuff. Work is going, crazy dads though. You'd think that with their daughters there that they'd not check out the staff or make comments but no. I was lunging the vaulting horse and when i'd have to use the whip you'd hear, ""hey, i'm over here"" or, ""how bout me? can i be next"" or, ""i've got the chains and handcuffs to go with that."" you learn to just block it out, you can't really say anything about it. As long as they're not asking for numbers it's all good. it's not like they hit on any of us, just make comments now and then or you can see/feel them watching. I'm glad that In-N-Out taught me to bend at the knees....it's come in handy if you catch my drift. Well, I'm sure there's much more to say but the words just aren't comming tonight. I will wish you all the best and I am off to dreamland where fantasies seem real!

"event","Ok, so last night was a blast as you can tell by my little recap posted earlier. Just an FYI....<STRONG>the only part that was true was the first part with Bob and Sally</STRONG> (and even then Bob, Sally, and I joke aroudn like that all the time)...the whole other part...yea that was me and Sally just being us and having fun with things. I don't think I've laughed so hard or had such a good upbeat convo with anyone online in a long time. Man....lately people from my past keep popping up, it's crazy. Sunday night it was a guy from work (In-N-Out), like two nights ago it was my friend Claude and another friend from the bowling alley. Yesterday at school it was three people that I used to hang out with and I never get to see them and there they were and then last night it was my long lost ""mom"" Jenny. It's crazy man. Here I've been thinking about all these people lately and bam...there they are. It was good to catch up and for some just let them vent  about everything that's been going on with them. Talk about fun times....*Sigh* If I could go back in time I would do so many things differently. Sally and I were reminiscing back to when we first met...almost a year ago now and thinking back to how I acted I can't believe that some of the peopel I was talking to then still are my friends today...I was such an insecure person who felt it was my way or the highway and I let you know when you weren't going my way...And to think that at the time I was getting mad at people for not wanting to hang out. I don't blame them one bit...if you're one of those people who still stuck by me as I went throught that phase and you still talk to me today, I commend you! Thank you soooo much!

In the dark of night I dream of you
Your image haunts my dreams.
Your piercing eyes are everywhere
Your voice but a remembrance...
Fleeting memories in my conciousness.

Where have you been all this time,
You're now but a ghost to me.
Hovering, watching in the distance,
A phantom playing with emotions.
Teasing me with a masked reality.

You appear on the swiftness of wings
And disappear just as quickly.
Random encounters plague my past,
ark smudges on an already gray surface
Which gets darker as the days go by.

You linger between fantasy and reality,
Dazed I'm pulled to the light.
You've faded into the badkground,
A blue I can no longer recognize.
In the dark of night I dream no more...


So much has happened lately I don't know where to begin. I guess the phrase when it rains it pours defintely fits right now.

"event","<STRONG>O yes, I am at camp! Working from 8am to 9pm. Need the hours though so it's all good in the hood. Just been passing time and thinking and such, I know, it's never a good thing when I've been thinking but there is so much in my head it's crazy! Last night I went to a dinner at church for growth group leaders and hosts. I am hosting a group at my house (basically my house is the meeting place). I love my grands, they open their doors for anyone who needs them, it's awesome! Yea, today I worked all day...mmmmmm...the taste of dust. Gotta miss it....But yea, back to the thinking thing, I'm not going to get into all the details, I guess I've just been realizing that I have a lot of ""junk"" in my life that I need to clean out...much like my room. I tend to keep stuff that I may use one day in the future and while it's in a place collecting dust it's taking up space for something that maybe I need right now. I need to learn how to let go of things and realize that I don't need to keep a hold of everything. If I really need something, I know God has a way of putting it back in my life when I need it. Well, this shall have to be continued later since I am needed for SRD ""Shit Removal Detail"" (cleaning the poop out of the horse palace where the kids play games). Love you all and all you Rawhiders I better be hearing from you soon! LITs we still need to go bowling!

"event","Ok, I was just flippin through the channels and stopped at the newest ""chopping"" invention. Its name ""The Magic Bullet"" Ok, the best thing about this infomercial is that there are a bunch of ""critics"" sitting around a table. Now these are supposed to be people who are just average Joe's like ourselves and are being shown the magic bullet for the first time. It is the worst acting I have ever seen. People go from being skepticle to oustounded in a matter of seconds and it's sooo corny. One lady has a cigaret in her mouth that isnt' real. It has about an inch and half of ""ash"" and it doesn't get any shorter during the entire 30 ""skit"". This infomercial is probably the funniest one ever. It's badly done and anyone who believes that these people who are sitting around are just average Joe's plucked off the street should be shot in the head. Now, the cool informercials are the ones with the knives....or my favorite, the rotiserie oven....""Set it and forget it!"" what a phrase! Too bad those things don't work like they say they do. O well....well, i'm going back to my channel surfing. hehe, Miracle Bullet....gotta love it."

<STRONG>Wanna-Be</STRONG>

<STRONG>I look around and it's interesting to see
That many aren't whom they seem to be.
Look past the masks and you'll be surprised
At who it is they're trying to hide.
From day to day their faces change, 
With just a few words they can rearrange
Who they are, where they're from....
Trying so hard to be someone.

Chorus:
(Since)Everyone's trying to be something they're not,
Changing everything being someone they're not.
But over here I'm just being me
Not like all those wanna-be's.

These wanna-be's are all around,
Look anywhere and they'll be found.
Catch them fast or soon you'll see
All the others they can be.
From friend to enemy, just a blink of an eye;
But just sit back and heave a sigh
For they will change, a new beginning
And leave you there, your head still spinning.

Chorus

Wanna-be's are everywhere
Here, there, even way out there.
Take some time to remove their masks
Even though it's a very large task.

Everyone's trying to be something they're not...(Wanna-be's)
Changing everything, being someone they're not...(Wanna-be's)

Something they're not,
Someone they're not...
Changing...

Everyone's tryin' to be something they're not
Changing everything, being someone they're not.
But over here I'm just being me
Not like all those wanna-be's.</STRONG>

<STRONG>-me</STRONG>"

Well, I hung around the ranch until 9 when I headed up to Temecula with a few people and then I went to the Stampede. It was fun, but made me realize how much I miss the counselors! There was no one to dance with! It was just me. :( But the girls had more than made up for it earlier in the night so it's all good. Just seeing those three was worth it!</STRONG>

<STRONG>I keep stumbling in the dark
I can't seem to get my footing.
Everytime I get up and running
Something knocks me down
My battle scars are numerous
Make-up only does so much.
My exterior is just a facade
Underneath it all, I am really black and blue.
This flame of mine is nearly smothered
From all the pain and emotion.
I am done being something I'm not.
My masks are now kindling;
Rebuilding, renewing, regenerating
What it was I had lost.
My mind is blank.
Like a canvas needing paint
I crave for soemthign new,
Something that's complete.</STRONG>"

It's amazing how many new brothers and sisters and good friends I made this summer. It is definitely something I will never forget. Well, now that I'm back I would love to catch up with all y'all.

"event","Why is it that once things seem to be looking up something happens that totally changes things around and makes you want to just scream. I enjoy my job, I love the kids, I love working with the animals, the thing I can't stand is that people here are treated like they have no emotions. You state how you are feeling and you get shot down by being told that you are over-reacting to a certain situation and made to feel like you mean nothing in front of all your co-workers. I love my job, don't get me wrong, but I can't wait until it goes back to weekend and weekday camps where I get to go home every night. I am going to miss everyone here when they leave, but no offense to any of them, I am counting down the days until it happens. I just want it to go back to me and the full/part-time staff. Next summer I can still see myself working here, but I will definitely just be full-time.

In other news, there's really nothing going on. I am planning on joining two bowling leagues this fall, a monday night and a wednesday night. It should be fun and maybe it will help me towards becoming pro which would be uber cool if it happened! I am looking forward to school and all the fun school things. It will be a welcome change of pace. Maybe I'll just stick to the Winter and Spring camps to be counselor and just stay full-time for summer.

The countdown is now at two weeks! Two weeks and I am allowed to leave this prison of mine and become free once again. I miss everyone and I hope to see you all sometime soon. I think of you all every night and just want to have it go back to the way it was."

"event","Well, my night/day off was full of fun. It started out by a group of us going to Acopulco (sp?) to celebrate Squishy's 21st b-day. Yes, we do still talk, but that's about it. Anyways, I had to take an early leave due to a previous engagment which has been held off for over a month now. Yes, I finally went and played some pool with Joe. Much fun, I had some pretty awesome shots, and some pretty ugly ones, but all in all it was a great night which ultimately ended in him winning 4-3 but that was better than the last time we played when i lost 8-0. Of course, silly me has to go and try to say that I can beat him (he used to pool shark people) and so we made some little bets. One bet was that I'd be his ""slave"" for a day. Well, he won that game. The next one was double or nothing. If he won I would be his slave for infinity or until he released me, if I won, no one was anyone's slave, and yes, guess what, I lost so now I am his slave until he decides he is tired of me. Good thing that he usually forgets such facts so I'm guessing it will only take a mere month before he forgets and I am once again a free person. But I did win the $2 bet and the 10 cent bet. Well, that was Wednesday night. Thursday I went to Sea World with my friend Rosie. She and I got the fun pass which means we can go back as many times as we want until next year. Well, on our way there we decided to call into 93.3 and guess what, yes, we were on the air. Well, she was, I was driving. It was pretty chill. Then we get to Sea World where we had a blast. We are going back next Thursday so if you want to come with us just give me a ring. Well, I better get going. It's not often that I get 45 min off. Hope to see/hear from you all soon. Don't forget that I do love letters (my address at the ranch is in a past entry). Miss you all!

I don't know how I'm going to be able to continue working on the ranch once summer is over without them. I have definitely found my nitch.

1) You can't trust anyone! No matter how hard you want to.
2) Even though I would take a bullet for any one of my friends, they won't necessarily do the same for me.
3) You find the most genuine people at the most random places at the most random times.
4) Corey is an amazingly awesome person who I hope to spend more time with once summer is over and I am no longer a prisoner of the ranch.
5) If I was anything like the children who come to the ranch, I drove my parents nuts!
6) I need to stop and think about what I say before I say it and learn when to chew people out and when to let them stew.
7) I am very good at picking up vibes from people no matter how hard they try to hide them.
8) I am extremely lucky for all that I have and I need to stop complaning and learn to appreciate that I am alive and have a loving family and people who care about me 24/7!"

O well, I'm having fun and learning sooooo much! Right now I'm working with the baby pony who is about a year old now. She's no little shetland, but not huge either. Today I went to get her out to let her stretch her legs (she hasn't been out in like a month at least) well, she and I had a little argument. Basically it was her running in circles around me and me getting dizzy waiting for her to calm down. But once she got to run out in the pasture for a little while she was much better and me and my friend Sara were able to introduce her to the hitching rail, which she took to very well so we ended the session on a good note. Sara and I are going to work with her more often, but it's so much fun because it's the first time I've been trusted with the early training of a horse/pony! It does take a lot of time and effort, but seeing them learn and remember and knowing that in order to teach them they have to have a trust in you means a lot. If she wasn't a pony I would so think of buying her. There are a couple babies (yearlings, horses) that I wouldn't mind buying, but now is not the time for me to have a baby. Maybe an older horse that wouldn't require so much attention.....who knows. If anyone knows anyone who knows about a good deal on a horse, give me a shout out."

I will say it now, if you are my friend right now and really don't want to be, tell me yourself. Don't find someone else to tell me. What I really hate though, is when people tell me to do something and I do it and later find out that they don't like me doing what they asked me to do. But, what really gets me is when they have a girlfriend and don't tell me. That's the best part. They say they want to hang out so you ask them to and then find out they have a gf and their gf flips out on you. talk about confusing and yea, just not worth it. So yea, as of now, I am the point where trust just isn't something I'm going to hand out to people anymore. to have my trust, you have to earn it. Until then, I will probably question most things people do since when I don't, I end up getting screwed over or my mind gets seriously messed with. In my book, that's not fun."

Here's what I'm talking about. I was at the Stampede tonight. He was there with her. I was trying my best to forget that they were there and enjoy myself, which I was doing quite fine. Dancin, chillin with peeps, normal Stampede activities. Well, I was on the rail of the dance floor looking for my friend when she walks up to me. She threatened me, to my face. Said I was dancing with him (which I wasn't, the people I was dancing with can witness to that) and she said that I have to leave him alone because she's only going to warn me once. Basically the message was, stay away from him or else.
So if any of you know a good identity I can aquire that comes drama free and I can just be happy go lucky with, please tell me (though I know none exists)"

Last night I went to dinner and to play pool with my friend Julie who is moving to Montana very soon. Her last day on the ranch is Friday. We had fun, I was doing very well until we joined up with some people and started playing two on two, then all my skill vanished and Julie and I got our butss kicked, although we did keep all the games close, we just couldn't seem to pocket the 8 ball. We are planning on heading to the Stampede on Friday as a little farewell sendoff. Here's how last weekend went:

Friday:
- Sleep can do you o so much good
- A lagoon isn't all it's cracked up to be from above the water

Saturday:
- Begining riders who have trouble understanding English shouldn't pick a ranch as a vacation spot
- Shannon did a great job redecorating her outside room
- Kicking back and chilling with friends is the perfect way to spend a Saturday night

Sunday:
- Dads who think they are cowboys and Rawhide Ranch do not mix
- Baby goats are the cutest little things
- Cori's got a great singing voice

This weekend is shaping up to be pretty nice as well. So Corey, when are we gonna hang out eh? Any good shows Saturday night?"

Aren't we supposed to be mature adults and talk out our problems, not threaten people? Am I just being totally stupid in thinking this? Honestly though, if this person is who I think it is, I am a little worried because I'm not positive how many people actually really do have my back, but I am positive that the ones who do won't let anything happen to me. Mainly because they know I tell the truth and don't stretch it, well, only when it comes to me. But whoever left that message....two words....GROW UP! I'm over jr. high bs about watch out, i'm gonna make your life miserable blah blah blah. I'm not about to let some stupid threat stop me from being me and it's not going to stop what I write in my LJ. No one besides yourself and one other person even knows you are so just let it go. If this isn't the person I think it is, well, same thing applies, but honestly, anonymous threats? If you're gonna threaten me at least have the boobs to say who you are. I hope you're at least that mature. So the next time you decide you want to leave something in my LJ, try growing some boobs and putting a name with it.

Anyways, enough of that. Work is going much better than it was this weekend. I'm enjoying myself. The only thing that sucks is that one of the girls' last day is the 23 and she and I have been getting close so that sucks, but we're still gonna keep in touch. Squishy doesn't really talk to me much, but o well, his loss. We were gonna hang out last night, but I didn't feel like driving to the ranch to chill with him and then having to drive home super late only to return at 8am. So I stayed at home, baked a cake, took and bath and then turned in for the night. My cat has been super cuddly with me lately. When I sat down at my comp to write this she jumped up onto my shoulder and is now playing with my hair, she can just be so cute at times, and at other times, just a little brat. But I love her and am going to miss her this summer while I'm living at the ranch, just like I'm going to miss all of you. But don't worry, I will be visiting you on whatever free time I have so be on the lookout for my sexy beast, Herby (my car, everyone loves her, that's how she got her name) to be in your area. And that's all I'm writing for today. Goodnight and God bless!"

But I went to the Officer's Club on base, just a little country bar/club. Well, Diana and Shannon went with and they both got trashed. It was so much fun cuz the three of us were messing with Squishy and his gf, just so we could get the look from hell from her. Diana is Squishy's Cowboy Cha-Cha partner, so when it was time, Diana went and got Squishy and the look we got from his gf would have killed Diana if looks could do that. She just doesn't seem to like me at all, and I have no idea why. I've met her once and then she only said hi and grabbed Squishy and left. O well, he still does talk to me every now and then when he's cornered. Last night he acted as though me, Diana and Shannon weren't there, we found it funny because we knew that he only did so to avoid having a confrontation with his gf. Poor guy. Anyways, just watching Diana and Shannon dance was totally worth the long bath I gave up to go last night. They were great and watching them walk from the car to the stairs at the house, well, words can't describe it. All in all, it was a very fun night and I am glad I work with such cool, chill people like that. But a little birdie (Shannon) told me Diana wasn't feelin too good at work today and that she has set her limit at 5, compared to the 10 Smirnoff's she drank last night. Smart girl."

"event","Well, I think I've finally come to a decision. Basically, what has to be done for me to be able to grow and live my life to the fullest is to give up any hope/dream/fantasy of Squishy being the good friend that he had the potential to be. What I've decided to do is to just be his friend, if he calls to hang out, sure I'll do it every now and then, but there's no way I'd ever hang out with him over someone else. I've done that for him one time too many and now, it's over. The friendship isn't over, but I have finally admitted to myself that he worked me good, I didn't see it coming at all. I'm trying very hard not to sound like I want people to pity me. It's just that at times, I do sound that way, and I really don't mean to, I just tell people what's going on and yes, I do tend to make it as a ""poor little ol me"" thing, but honestly, who doesn't do that when you know you're in a situation that hurt you and you did it to yourself. I do try to say that it wasn't me, it was the other person, but I will admit, that most of the time, it is me that inflicts the pain on myself.
***Smitty just called me! All the way from Bahrain! It was so nice to hear his voice again. I miss that boy so much, he's someone who I know no matter what he'll always be here for me. I wonder what he will do when he learns about Squishy's shenanigans. O well.***
Back to what I was saying, what I am going to do now is just sit back, and really look at what I am looking for in friendships with people. I don't want to settle, which is what I did with Squishy. I was looking for a close friendship, saw potential in him and pounced without looking around to see what else was out there. What I need to do is hand God the reigns of my life and not try to grab them back when he starts taking me somewhere I really don't want to go."

I know that everyone else is always there for me, but they don't seem to understand what I'm going through. I just need people who will talk and not try to tell me what to do. People who will just sit back and let me vent and let me throw a pity party for myself every now and then. I just want this feeling of being empty to go away. I have yet to find that one person who seems to be able to fill and when I think I have, something happens and that person is taken away somehow.

So yea, if any of you know any good cures tell me, because if there is one thing I can't do, it's not talk. Mainly because of my job, and mostly because I love to talk.

Well, I had the craziest dream.....It started with me pulling into my granparent's driveway and seeing my sister's cat walking outside. (just an FYI my grands live in Vista, my sis lives in LA) Now her cat was the fattest, furriest cat you have ever seen. I think her cat had dreads or somethin, but it was big. Well, I walk inside and I see my dad. My dad had this crazy gray and red beard goin on (another FYI my dad has black hair and a big ol bald spot) so the beard took me by surprise. I walk into my room and my mom and sis are on my computer. She found a picture of my friend Joe looking dorky, one of me in a pink shirt and some random guy, and a pic of one of my beanies that I can't find right now. We all then pile into a car and I rumage around trying to find all my money. I don't remember how much I had and I find a $7 bill and a bill from another country. Suddenly I remember that someone gave me $110 and I start looking for that. One of my sister's friends says something about her printer comming alive at 2am and waking her up. I then start talking about how my printer needs ink and my mom yells at me for not telling her sooner......that was my dream I had while waiting to go to class. Crazy isn't it. The weirdest thing, I know why I dreamt of some of the things like the really furry cat (the horses at the ranch are all shedding), the pictures (i've been working with my pics a lot lately), the $110 (one of my friends got paid that much for taking some kids to Disneyland...and that's after the ticket price), and the printer (my printer really does need ink).

"event","Ok, so I am on my way home from work, looking forward to being able to lay down and relax after a long day of standing, walking, talking, and just getting frustrated. There is a point in the road when I can turn or keep going and everyone else stops. Well, this guy pulled a California stop and basically merely tapped the brakes. Well, I had already commited to turning and we nearly collided. He slammed on his brakes and I swerved around him. Well, of course I keep&nbsp;going and I'm shaking. I thank God for saving me from an accident and I do acknowledge the fact that I was going a bit too fast. But I keep going and I see that someone is on my ass. If there is one thing I hate it is tailgaters. I was going at least 10-15 mph over the speed limit and for him to be on my ass like that was crazy. But I keep going, I slowed just a little and finally reach the light at the end of the road. So I'm sitting there listening to N'Sync when someone taps on my window. I roll it down and it was the guy from the stop sign that almost collided with me. He proceeds to tell me how I almost killed both of us and how I am a bad driver. He said that I drive crazy and unsafe. He then looks at me, asks if I'm a teenager. I tell him that I'm going to be 20 in May and he says that I shouldn't be on the road. Now, just to let you know, when we almost collided he was going in the opposite direction of me. He followed me&nbsp;for about 3-4 miles out of his way&nbsp;just to harass me and tell me I shouldn't be driving. Stupid."

<P><FONT size=1>In other news, I start at the ranch on Thursday, I am very excited. Squishy and I are still really good friends and that makes me happy. We still hang out and chill and have a blast together. Communication is definitely the way to go. However, it is hard to communicate when certain others make it impossible for you to talk to them. They are always busy....what they mean is, they are too busy for you. They make time for all the other people, you know, the ones they have crushes on and hope to some day marry, but when it comes to you, they don't give a c-rap and yet, act like they do. All I want to do is sit down with these people and have them tell me exactly what they want. You want me to be a face in the crowd, done. You want me to just sit back and chill, done. You want me to leave you alone, done. I just need to know. So you know who you are. Please, all I'm asking is for one time, face to face. Just to let us talk.</FONT></P>

"event","at the moment, I am sitting in the lavish foyer of a lavish hotel on Universal property, wearing a lavish evening gown and surrounded by other women in equally lavish gowns.  Normally I would be bored out of my mind, as this is a work function for my husband.  However, I am grinning ear to ear.

Why?

Because last year I wore this stunning ball gown with a slight train on it.  I was a bit overdressed in my opinion.  This yeat mt dress is just as lovely but without a train.... and almost every woman here is wearing a near carbon copy of my dress last year.  

I am highly amused.  This is going to be fun."

"event","I agree with my sister. My brother is getting worse when staying with my mother. I don't know if she is purposely trying to drive him to this point, but his behavior is rapidly returning to the state of complete breakdown he once existed in when he lived with my parents.  Mom doesn't seem to realize this.  More to the point, she is allowing him to do whatever he likes out of a really warped state of guilt.

Yes, she should have put her foot down about 20 years ago when the symptoms of this mental illness first appeared.  But she didn't.  It's the past.  Having a guilty conscience is one thing.  

Letting your son go utterly insane because you can't bear to make him do anything hard is something else entirely.

He now believes that he is quite sane, that he is possessed by demons, and that he is having daily conversations with people in heaven.  Any attempt to ask him why or how he feels about these things is met with a very odd circular non-logic on how worship turns people into slaves and takes away their free will.

If this comment had come from the mouth of any other person, I would have delighted in the chance to debate about it.  Coming from my brother, after watching him sit in the living room and laugh and talk to someone that wasn't there, I really couldn't take that comment as a statement backed up by a sane thought process.

I am so worried for him now. He's going to move out of state with my mother, and I will lose what little power to help him that I possess.  This is truly a new kind of hurt, a pain that is 5% rage, 5% helplessness, and 90% sorrow for a loss that hasn't even happened yet."

Mom-in-law came out of her surgery just fine.  I posted a while back something along the lines of ""Ouch... just ouch.""  Well, I wasn't allowed to talk about it then. I can say now that the surgery went well and hopefully no further medical steps will be necessary. I can breathe a bit easier today and catch my breath before the recovery stage kicks in.

Sometimes bad things happen for good reasons. I suppose that is the moto of my life in the past six to eight months.  Highlights of my rollercoaster of a life:

1.) Mom had an affair. 

2.) Parents got divorced.  This sux. Seriously.  They are behaving like eight year olds and using me and my brother Chris as go-betweens.  I'm very worried about my father.  He's taking this very, very hard.

3.) Mom's engaged to a man who is probably a good guy, but I can't stand because he had this affair, knowing Mom was married.  It doesn't matter that they were highschool sweethearts and that Mom considered the marriage over almost a decade ago. You just don't do that.

4.) Mom's upset because I won't go to the wedding in OCTOBER!  The ink isn't even dry on the divorce degree and she's planning to run off, leave the state, and marry this guy.

5.) Johnny (my other brother) had another psychotic break. It's no secret that he is very schizophrenic.  His doctors believe the stress of the divorce was the main fracture point in this break.  Our parents were his one strength, his only focus in the storm of delusions that he knew would always be real.  

6.) Work is fluctuating due to the state of the economy.  I have weeks when I have everything in the world to do and then some.  I have weeks where I'm holding onto my desk just to draw a paycheck.  Very not good.

7.) Trying to get my sister her driver's license and to help her find money for college. She graduates on June 4th.  

8.) Moving. Bleh. Self-explanatory. (Love love LOVE the new place, but hate moving >.<)

All things considered, I am still healthy (relatively).  I have a job and a car, a roof over my head and a husband that loves me.  I have two wonderful baby kitties (not so little anymore!) who love me, too.  I have friends.

I have many, many blessings for which I am grateful.  I also have many, many, hardships that eat at my time. Hopefully something will ease up soon."

~*~*~*~*~

CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #189
Last winter the magazine Entertainment Weekly did a story about me in which I was called ""the angriest man in television."" When the article came out I shrugged and said things like, ""Oh, it's just a trashy tabloid, it doesn't mean anything."" But you know what? That's a lot of crap. It's taken me ten months to get in touch with my feelings about that article (pretty quick for a guy), and guess what? I'm angry! How dare anyone suggest I have no right to feel what I feel? If you're even barely engaged in this world, anger manifests itself constantly (assuming you're not medicated, which I am not, dammit to hell!). And let's be totally honest here, anger does a lot of good. It clenches my stomach muscles into a tight knot so I can look good with my shirt tucked in. It adds hours and hours of productivity by keeping me awake until five o'clock in the morning. It's a constant reminder that I should never own a gun. It makes golf an opportunity to practice my javelin toss. It fills me with joy every time Lewis Black is on The Daily Show. It adds sizzle to caffeine. It whispers to me that I'm fine, that I don't need to slow down, and that my cardiologist is an idiot. It keeps people at a healthy distance during flu season (and the rest of the year as well). And finally, it encourages me to use my vanity card to foolishly burn bridges with TV critics. Hey EW! Do not screw with me. I've got two vanity cards now, and I'm not afraid to use 'em! Okay, the sun's coming up, I'm gonna try and get some sleep."

Once again, it's after midnight here and I'm still awake.  I know that if I continue to stay on the computer, or read, or even watch the brain-killing crap that passes for television these days, I won't get to sleep at all.  

Stoopid time change.  I hate thee.  

Stoopid insomnia.  I hate thee even more, for thou hast made me realize how much thy Honoured Spring Break truly sucketh. I have no homework right now that would bore me to tears (and the subsequently to sleep) this week.  So... yeah.

Wide. Freaking. Awake.  

Nothing left to clean in my apartment.

"event","I would like to state, for the record, that I hate working in groups in order to complete class projects.  Most people you get randomly assigned to your group are:

1. lazy
2. don't care
3. taking the class as an elective
4. all of the above
5. vapid airheads (including the men)
6. people who have no care in the world about anyone else, or anyone else's plans.

Needless to say, these groupmates helped ruin my weekend.  It started off well enough with one kick-ass mage game.  Then saturday ended up being rather spiffy at home with <lj user=casualmuse>.  Sunday I never got to make it to church, but that was okay, because I was going to have lunch with <lj user=pen_dragon> and <lj user=northernminx>.  That went awesome, too.  Then I was supposed to come home and kick ass on what was left of my part of the project.

Notice I said ""my part of the project.""

Yeah, the other three hadn't done shit.  Which meant I had to do the whole thing myself or risk failing a large part of the class.  Which further meant that I couldn't make my dinner plans with Nicole and <lj user=moonpanther>.  That really pisses me off.

I spent the whole night on Sunday working on that stupid project.  I completed it and had to stand next to the other three idiots to present it.  Did I mention that I had to coach them through the whole thing?  Did I mention that Dr. Green noticed how I had to rush in and save them each time they opened their mouths?

I hate people.

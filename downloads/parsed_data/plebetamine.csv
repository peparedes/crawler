Went to Hanley yesterday to meet Lucy. I got lost trying to find the ""memorial""....I think I turned right instead of left, noob.
When I did finally get there we sat on the some grass talking with these other guys and got mobbed by emos. 
We moved to this wasteland place that was packed with people. Met some really sound people. I got completely shitfaced. I drunk about 13 bottles of lager and a load of whisky and vodka!
Was altogether an amazing day but I feel sooo fucking rough now.
Some guy bit my arm.
No work till Tuesday so thats ok!"

"event","The car's on fire an there's no driver at the wheel
and the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
and a dark wind blows

the government is corrupt

and we're on so many drugs
with radio on and the curtains drawn

we're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
and the machine is bleeding to death

the sun has fallen down
and the billboards are all leering
and the flags are all dead at the top of their poles

It went like this:

the buildings tumbled in on themselves
mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble
and pulled out their hair

the skyline was beautiful on fire
all twisted metal stretching upwards
everything washed in a thin orange haze

I said, ""kiss me, you're beautiful
these are turly the last days.""

you grabbed my hand and we fell into it
like a daydream or a fever

we woke up one morning and fell a little further down
for sure, it's the valley of death

I open up my wallet and it's full of blood."

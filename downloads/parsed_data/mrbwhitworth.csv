"event","Everyone seems to think JS Bach was the father of our basic music theory but from what I learned, Rameau was reponsible for our basic establishement in theory.  

He clarified the musical practice of his time but also influenced the next 200 years of music theory.  ""He considered the chord the primal element in music and held that the major triad was generated naturally when the string was dividied into, two, three, four, and five equal parts.  (He later became aware that the overtone series supported his beliefs.)""

""He theorized that chords were built up by thirs within the octave, so that triads could be expanded to seventh chords.  And downward beyond the octave to ninth and eleventh chords.  Rameau recongnized the identity of a chord through all it's inversions.  Rameau established the tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords as the pillars of tonality and related other chords to these, formulating the hierachies of functional harmony.  He also stated the idea that modulation might result from the change of function of a chord (a pivot chord)""

Yada."

"event","<i>Baazelbull's Procession Through Hell</i> is now complete.  The Orchestral Score.  The Percussion Score.  And, the orchestral parts (includes percussion parts)

I've already made a copy of the two scores.  My planned theory is to mail the scores out and have them reviewed or studied by conductors who may have a spark of interest in playing the piece.  

I've started the second movement for now.  But I made myself a promise.  All this working and writing has got to pay off.  Period.  If I don't hear a word from anyone, I'm seriously gonna hang up the composing."

"event","<P><FONT color=#000099>I decided to rip up the percussion score and start again and go full blast this weekend.&nbsp; I plan on staying home due a meeting at work Sunday morning, six am.&nbsp; Who as meetings Sunday morning at six am?&nbsp; The reason I decided to start a new is because I found several errors in the old percussion score of the Procession Through Hell and instead of making marks for corrections, I've decided to just start over.&nbsp; Another reason was several places I had wrote something that totally didn't make sense.&nbsp; So, fresh mind, fresh start.&nbsp; The original plan was to have about 13-15 percussionist scored for the piece.&nbsp; In reality, that's a bit hard, so, I'm having to brush the score to around five players, that includes the Timpani.&nbsp; I also need the Xylophone/Glock. Player.&nbsp; In addition, I'm not giving up a hand cymbol part, nor will I depart with the Bass Drum and Snare sections.&nbsp; I have decided that my Snare player will also be responsible for suspended cymbol and chinese cymbol as well as the Gong.&nbsp; The bass drum player will get off lucky with just his one part because they have problems keeping the beat anyway.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>On Monday of next week, I'll be skipping down to Office Max to spend a bit of money making copies of the score to the Procession Though Hell.&nbsp; And already, mentally, I've been keeping lines of a letter to Mr. Kidwell about the piece in general.&nbsp; I'm also including an extra smaller piece for String Quintet.&nbsp; ""Tango: Dance for Demons.""&nbsp; This piece is also uploaded on my web page.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>At some point, in September, I plan to work on a Viola piece with Piano.&nbsp; I've scratched out a few melodies in my notebook so pretty soon I'll be flowing those together.&nbsp; I also manage to start the second movement to the tone poem suite in which the Procession Though Hell is the first movement.&nbsp; The second will be a slight bit more ""heavenly"" and I most likely will not be able to include the piece in midi format as I am having problems with my Midi program.</FONT></P>

"event","Hello folks and thanks for checking in.

I'm currently working on a project for full orchestra.  <i>Baalzelbull's Procession Through Hell</i> is the title of the piece.  There is currently a midi of the work on my web page.  Feel free to give it a listen.  Note, for some odd reason it registars as a long long piece.  However, it's just over four minutes long.  The Procession Through Hell is the first of a three movement tone poem based off the final battle between Good and Evil.  This is the first of these three movements and depics Satan preparing his army of demons, skeltons, and the likes.

The second movement is planned for a more ""heavenly"" setting, complete with text from the Bible sung by an SATB choir.  Strings and the Church Organ will also be well featured within this movement.  The rest of the orchestra remains as Tacet until the Third movement, the battle itself.

My current status is on the first movement.  The full score has been written out.  I'm nearlly completeing the String Section's parts of the orchestra, which, will leave only the Percussion Section remaining to copy parts.

The process has taken over a full year just for this one movement.  The next step, after all parts have been written, is to find a good community orchestra willing to give the first movement a read through or possibly a premier.

Should you have the desire to listen to the midi just follow the link to the web page.  Comments can be posted here in this journal or you may email them to me.  

Have a plesant day."

"event","Hello and Welcome to the Professional Journal of B. Whitworth (that's me) where I plan to keep an updated account of my music.

I'm gonna take a second and explain my theory.  I'm not expecting to make money in the field.  Gave that dream up long before it even started.  However, it ever comes a knockin' I certainly won't send it on it's merry way.  

For the most part, I write to keep my sanity even though there are times I felt like I've already lost that.  On occassion, a very small one at that, I'm asked to write pieces for performers or small enesembles.  At the moment, there is no charge for my music.  However, as it does take time work pieces, there may be future charges.  In addition, I also write pieces for dedications to friends I know personally.  

To this date, I've had three world premiers.  You can find a list of complete works in my ""Info"" page.  Soon, there will also be a link to a web page where you can find midi files.  

Thanks for checking in.

B."

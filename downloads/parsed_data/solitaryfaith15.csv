soooo
ive been having a WONDERFUL time since i got home from camp. not that camp wasnt great fun...minus the 18 hours days and working on my birthday and basically working ALL summer long. Yeah i did enjoy camp...maybe a little too much. see, theres this guy who i became very good friends with. hes smart, funny, sexy, sweet...basically everything you could ever WANT in a guy. he even knows how to have a good time. problem is...we have an age difference. its not a BIG age difference, but it is noticeable to other people. i mean, i dont really notice it and he doesnt seem to either...but everyone else does. and im not really sure whether its just a CRUSH or something else.... but ANYWHOOOOOOOO

we are juniors this year! and i flippin got a car for my 17th b-day! and i think i have a JOB at the Park Danforth.
thats gonna be a snap after PTC. 

Now i feel bad bragging but i really am proud of myself. i grew up so much this summer and i didnt go completely crazy...i think thats a BIG accomplishment...but ya know. i dunno im just glad i got myself out in the real world this summer. it was really like living on my own. i had the chance to do ANYTHING i wanted and get myself into LOADS of trouble and i didnt. i also met a group of wodnerful people who taught me there is more to life than just your cell phones and your ipods and weekly trips to the mall. all in all everything worked out well and im pretty sure ill be doing it again next year. i cant wait."

So basically this entry is to all my friends including, Mere, Joe, Frankie, Lindz, Sarah, Zoe, John, Alicia, Molly, Amanda, Becky, Magda and anyone else whose name i didnt mention im sorry but i can never remember everyone i know but ill still miss you! well i must go order dinner now.

"event","i agree wholeheartedly with mere. love is nothing compared to the love of your friends. i would never sacrifice anything for the love i have for my friends or the love that my friends have of me. even if he seemed like the number one. i think love is something that has to be accomplished over time and is not something that you know in a matter of days. i think love means that they are the one person you can be yourself around and the one person who you would entrust your life to, hands down. now i dont know much about love but ive had my fair share of crushes. ive found that when it comes to love, you do stupid stupid things. 

another thing about love that bothers me is that in highschool everyone is 'in love'. half the people who say that arent in love. most of them dont even know the meaning of the word. a few months pass and they are dating someone else and saying they love that person. i think at this point, dating is meaningless. its a short term rush that ends in a fit of tears and hurtful words. i think having many many friends of the opposite sex is a better choice then dating as many as you can. there is plenty of time after highschool to date people and i for one feel sorry for anyone who feels they need to tie themselves down now. why not be free and just live life and have fun?
well thats my 2 cents worth on love. hope you liked it."

this person makes a very good point, why the hell do you like pop and pretend to be punk, i just dont get it. 


One question: Why the fuck do you care? So what if i wanna act punk? So what if i wanna listen to pop? I dont think there is anything wrong with the way i act. I wear jeans and a sweatshirt-doesnt seem very 'poser punk' to me. And I listen to rap, rock, oldies, uh pretty much everything but country. Id just like to know who the fuck you are to think that you can judge other people just by the music they listen to and the way they dress. I have never in my life said 'Im punk'. I have said i dress punk because i used to wear big black baggy pants with chains hanging off of them. I wore typical 'punk' attire. But i wasnt punk and I never will be. And if you have so much to say, sign your name and ill get back to you and you can rant and rave all you want to me about whats wrong with the way i act and and what music i listen to. But if you're too cowardly to sign your name to your own damned complaint, then i suggest you keep you comments to yourself. No one likes a stuck up, snotty coward."

Do these look familiar? If you're one of the cowardly pricks who left these messages, please feel free to sign your name to it. I'd love to hear more about what you think I am. As for the 'please just stop', please just stop what? I'm not a fucking mind reader. You're going to have to be more specific then that. And who gives a fuck what my email address is?!? Come on now!

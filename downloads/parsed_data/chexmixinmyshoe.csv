you fucking suck. i can't handle you anymore. because of you im hating the thought of having kids. thank you very fucking much. tonight you're giving me all this about having it be someone or something that takes over you and all that cal. i should've just left you outside the whole night. you out there crying and pounding your fist into your head or the glass window whatever the difference may be. maybe you would've broken the window or your head and when the adrenaline went away feel the pain and frustration and thats how i feel when i have to deal with you.

dear you,

what a real horrowshow job you did of raising him. maybe this or that could really be the cause of it and i do give you credit for the fact that you can laugh at the situations including him. i however try and cannot. the fact still remains that he continues to treat you and i and everyone this way except for him. him being my father. why not him? i have no fucking clue but i give up. it is a sad thing to give up on. i have to be selfish with this now though or it will only get worse. maybe you will soon realize that things need to change."

"event","i am really really tired and delirious. my left middle finger and elbow are irritating. all because of skateboarding. i woke up this weekend each day at 430 in the am to go skate LBJ. the bowl...ahhh....sweet lovliness. i ollied the 3! bad ass for me even tho i skate with 11 stair olliers. they can suck it tho. i am stoked. i want to live my life like that. except maybe change my sleep schedule so im not so irritable. oh this is what i want out of life and i will be adding to it as often as possible...

i want to live and enjoy life to the fullest. i want to experience everything. i want to learn from my mistakes and my failures but my successes as well. i want to have thousands of stories to tell. i want to be able to write with both hands and speak many languages. i want to be a good person and have my dream job. i want to have kids and raise them to be the coolest people. i want to wake up at 430 in the morning everyday and skate with my best friends ever. i want to help and inspire people. i want to write and have read books on anything. i want to travel and meet hundreds of different kinds of people. i want to make movies. i want to love. i want to live in a motorhome and be spontaneous. i want to learn. i want to have scars and have bled out of passion."

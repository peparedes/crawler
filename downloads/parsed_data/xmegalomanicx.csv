Check it out and let me know what you think.

""Tear"" is the name of the track.

I am going for a noisier approach with this album, hence the title. The artwork and everything will represent it well. I am very proud of what is coming out of this. Some tracks are ""friendly"", like those on my last album, Zolpidem, while others are pretty ""unfriendly"" and brutal. 

Not only is this album in the works, but a lot of material will surface in several places.

Stay tuned. This year and next year are both going to be big years for me. I think I am coming into my own, and my creativity is in a surge."

KMFDM - Sturm & Drang Tour 2002 - Houston, TX

The reason why this show sticks out so much to me is because at the time, KMFDM was my favorite band. In my eyes, no other band could top them. I was a fan before they broke up, so when they got back together, it made me very, very excited. Then this tour was announced, and me and my close friend Mark Hodge went. It was at a club called Numbers in Houston. We managed to make it all the way up to the very front, against the barricade. First was Kidney Thieves, who were simply amazing. I loved their performance. I had heard of them beforehand, and did a remix for a remix contest on ACIDplanet.com of theirs. The singer was very hot. I got the drummer's drum sticks, which was awesome. 

Then came 16 Volt. At the time, I really didn't know who they were. What they sounded like to me at the time was Nu Metal, so I was very disappointed. The whole crowd seemed to be trying to boo them offstage. The singer came up and said ""Give me your camera! Hurry!"" and I told him to fuck off. I feel very bad, because I didn't realize at the time he was just going to take pictures on stage for me and give me the camera back. I thought he was trying to take it, for whatever reason. Either way, didn't like them. I listen to some of their material now, but back then, I didn't like them a bit. 

Then KMFDM came out. I was in a crazed state, seeing Sascha right before me. They played an awesome set, and I remember when Raymond Watts first came out, my excitement went up a few notches. Was a great show all the way around.

After the show I went to the merchandise booth and purchased 2 KMFDM shirts, the Sick City compilation with a lot of Pig and related material, KMFDM - Opium 1984, Kidney Thieves - Zerospace, and all kinds of other stuff.

I'm not as into KMFDM as I was back then, Skinny Puppy is now my favorite band, but seeing them live was amazing, and that is the most memorable one for me."

"event","I've been looking back on my life a lot lately, and thinking about how grateful I am where I am now. Out of each of those horrible and miserable times in my life, I gained something: strength. 

All those years of wandering from house to house in South Park, one of the bad areas of Beaumont, TX, as a crackhead. And, yes, I'll let it out here, since it IS LJ, the years of shooting coke, heroin and meth. And we won't even get into the shit I was doing when I was 15. 

All of that game to an end on Christmas Day, 2008. And I can't say how great I feel about it. I don't feel useless, and I have noticed my creativity and concentration boots considerably. I also enjoy life, for all of its many things. I feel as I have healed. And it is a wonderful feeling.

I still speak to some of those I used to use with, and it breaks my heart to know that they are still in that void, that lapse of reason. I still love them, and will be their friends, but when it comes to hanging out sometime, it would have to depend on the conditions. I just pray that I don't relapse, and I'm going to keep working hard at it. I also do not miss the drugs at all. I can't say I ever have a time where I crave something.

I'm going to get more active on LJ. I want to share my thoughts again."

"event","I rarely type blogs anymore, but I felt the need to express myself again. Here we go.

Its been just about a year since Amber and I split up. That was probably one of the most painful things I had ever experienced. I had this girl that I really loved, and would do anything for. She told me it was the same, got out, and after sucking all the generosity out of me she could, she showed her true colors. When she said we were done, out of the blue, I had hit a low spot, for sure. I could not imagine the pain I felt then, prior to that. I had also went further into addiction than ever before, and God knows I was pretty bad into it, before I met her. I really fell of the deep end.

After I destroyed myself time and time again, I began to realize things, and my whole mentality on life changes. And I don't hate her for leaving me, I almost thank her, because it allowed me to fall so far down that I got sick of it, and here I am now, almost one full year sober. I do not hate her, but I don't have positive feelings for her, either, in any way. I've tried to be a friend. She promised me when out of nowhere she decided she didn't want to be with me, that forever she would be there for me, just like I was for her. I went way beyond the call of duty for her, but I loved her so much, there was no such thing as ""beyond the call of duty"". I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

I'm not really sad about it anymore. I would be pretty pathetic if, after a full year, I was not over it. However, there is still a little wound here, even if I don't think about it so much. Once in a blue moon I think of what could of been, and those feelings come back, but those periods don't last long. In fact, not more than a few minutes. I was stupid for trusting her, and I let a really good girl down over her. I would do anything for said girl, but it is too late, as I chose to be used rather than to be truly loved. Tania, I am so sorry. You were right. And I wish I could turn back the hands of time and see what I really had then. I was a complete fool. But best wishes to you.

And best wishes to Amber. I hope she lives a wonderful life. Even if she won't even talk to me and lied about being a friend no matter what just like she did about our relationship.

Look at me now. I'm doing better than I ever have in my life. I've got a great job, and I've cleaned up. I love life, and nothing can stop that. I would really love to have a girlfriend, a girl who really sees the love I have to give, and one that will appreciate it, not use it for their own what have yous.

I am very creative lately. I have so much material is rediculous as far as my music goes. I love the, because that has stayed with me. My outlet for what goes on in my life. You will hear a lot of that from me soon.

All I have to say is that I am happy. I've proved all of the people who didn't believe in me such as Amber, wrong. That puts a smile on my face. So many people saw me as an eternal dope fiend of some type, and I can't say that they didn't have reason to believe that. But if they would have stuck around a bit longer and saw how I was able to overcome the addictions and what not

Just some thoughts on life. That's all."

"event","Over the years I have neglected this Live Journal in many ways. I remember when I first got the journal, in 2002. I posted to this several times a day, with random thoughts and a lot of things that didn't make any sense. Every once in while I'll go back and ready old entries, and laugh at the person I was. I would laugh at entries I'd post at age 16 about how I was going to release an album and start a record label, when I didn't know shit about that. Sure, I was progressing in musical abilities and learning, but I was nowhere near making an album, and damn sure nowhere near starting any form of organization.

There are also those posts about past girlfriends and things that make me laugh. The posts about certain drug habits and other things. I was careless, and exposed each and every element of my life here. And I feel that that was stupid, in a sense. But again, I also think it was part of becoming who I am.

Look at my LJ icons. I've got Mr. T, The Dude, and a picture of me with ""lolololol"" stamped in red lettering over my head. None of this has changed since at least 2005. I think this journal serves its purpose as a way for me to look back at my life and look at it now.

These days I feel a bit inward again, as if I'm consumed within myself. But only half way, if that makes sense. I have a social life, but not near as social as it was, say, 4 or 5 years ago. Of course, I delved into deeper addictions, and other things like that. Now it is different, its learning to act as a person again, to be human. And it feels good. I'm building a new social life, and yes, I do have a love interest. But I've got my guard up and I've grown up so much over the years.

I'm pretty content with my life, but there is a lot of work I have to do on it yet. I finally put an album out, even if it isn't what the expectations I set for years set it up to be. However, I am very proud of it. I am proud of every bit of it, and what I put out, because I feel it is reflective of my learning and abilities from 2007-2008. 

I don't know, I'm also consumed in my job at the moment. I am worked several days in a row. Its hard for me to get out and do things, because of my hours, and because the things that my friends plan on doing are normally when I am either at work or trying to rest. 

I just love that I can look back at my life by logging on here. Its amusing."

Her: No, my husband moved them somewhere. I can't find them because I can't go through all that right now. He died a week ago.

I've been playing World of Warcraft, Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Bioshock. Yes, thats quite a few games to be playing at a time, but I don't believe World of Warcraft counts in that. That is a game that you never stop playing, apparently.

As far as music work goes, I've been sitting quietly trying to decide my next move, as well as organizing the remix album project. I will begin work on my remixes soon. Again, if any of you are interested in remixing, let me know.

I'm trying to decided the exact concept for this next release. I know I am going to start recording vocals. I've got a few themes in mind. I have been inspired by a lot of things, like Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar, and Skinny Puppy's Cleanse, Fold, & Manipulate. Not really sure yet, but what I CAN assure, is I'm not going to try and copy their sounds or anything. 

Other than that, life is good. But Defender Pro is working the hell out of me. 8 days in a row, two days off, two days of work, one day off, and then another 8 or 9 days. FUCK. Oh well.

"event","So, the remix EP/LP for Zolpidem is in the works and underway. I've done a glitchy noise remix of one of the tracks to serve as an introduction, Mark Hodge (of our old band .drug.) is doing a very tripped out remix of ""parakeetmescaline"" and my friend Dustin is rapping over ""Aggression"". He has a very unique style, and I feel honored to have him on the track. Peter is supposed to remix one, as well. I'm still looking for people to remix, as well, and doing remixes myself. 

I am going to use some of the new stuff I have been learning on the remixes. I think it will be just as enjoyable as the original album, rather than just this remix disc. I think feel it will be more of an extension of ""Zolpidem"", than a ""remix album"".

"event","So, the reception of my album as been fairly well so far. I haven't really received any negative feedback. What surprises me is how so many people around here like it. You can't judge a book by its cover, but these people are typically into 80's rock, and if not that, 90's rock. If not that, its the emo/rap mash up kids who don't really make a lot of sense. Then again, as I said, you can't judge a book by its cover. A lot of them are saying things like ""I've never heard anything like this before, I was expecting techno, but this is really neat."" So, I've referred them to the influences, Skinny Puppy, Ministry, etc. 

Then there are a few of those who say ""This was made for you to hallucinate to, wasn't it?"" No, it was not. It was made to be an album, and that is what it is. What you do with it is up to you. The chemical name for Ambien served as the title because the music does sort of remind me of the feeling it gives. That, and it was sort of spur of the moment. 

At work they have began scheduling me 8 days in a row. I am getting a bit sick of that, but its whatever. Time is money. Three day weekend starting next Friday. So that is a good thing. 

I always hate the weekends at work. So boring. You know that everyone else is out having fun, doing their thing, while you are sitting in front of a computer listening to some asshole tell you how its your fault he's got viruses on his computer, because your product put them on there. I don't know where people get some of these ideas. Do they really think that the product they buy at Wal Mart or Best Buy is sold with viruses on it, because that is legal and that is what we do, and then we give them a phone number and address to contact us with? It is humoring, but it gets old after a while. The majority of our callers are the ones who have no understanding of computers, and its normally the same fix. They will argue with you, but at the same time apo9logize for not being ""computer literate"". Very strange. I just treat them kindly and move on.

Anyways, on to work. Enough babbling."

"event","So, I'd like to elaborate a little bit on my new album, Zolpidem, and explain and clarify things while doing so. 

As you should all know, it was originally meant to be an 8 track EP with a theme rooted in a very dark period in my life. It was going to explore a time in my life when I was what I felt was subhuman, and expose the feelings and the ""inside of my head"" at that time, musically. The recording began in late 2007. I went with this theme for a long time, and made several announcements about its release. However, that is a hard thing to do when you are still in the same head space, and going through the same ordeals. Its sort of hypocritical, and causes a big conflict. I sent the tracks to my good friend and long-time collaborator Peter Bellisario in 2008 for him and Steve Stigma to work on and spice up for me. Then, I went on another hellish roller coaster of life. For nearly a year, I was unable to do anything else. I won't reveal too much about my personal life, not much more, anyways.

So, in late 2008, after going through a very hard split up with a girl whom I thought I loved, and loved me back, I received the files from Peter. I was blown away with what they had done with it. I immediately began working on more musical experiments, including two other versions of the the track ""The Zolpidem Shuffle"". I began putting a lot of thought into the idea of putting these tracks in with the EP. So, therefore, the concept died in early 2009. 

I made a move to Iowa in April of this year that made a big change in me. With that, came a boost of creativity, so I went crazy with music creation. I began working on several tracks, although they won't all make the cut.

With all this said, Zolpidem is being prepared for release finally after being postponed several times over the past year and a half. I chose the name Zolpidem, which is Ambien, if some of you didn't know, due to the fact that the sound and feel of the album is very similar to the effects of Zolpidem. The sound is very uncontrolled, there are no conventional music rules. It goes all over the place, and does what it wants. And it is also an end of an era in my musical evolution. I think you will all see how I am progressing when you hear it.

I have been deliberating on how to release it. I thought, should I try to sale this album? And immediately I decided that was not an option. I've been around for a long time in the underground music thing, but I have no established myself yet, and I don't feel this will, but I feel that it will lay the foundation. Aside from that, it is my art, and I want people to experience it without having to pay for it. Maybe one day that will come. But not today. 

The album will be released online for free. First, through email via a .zip file, including the tracks and the album artwork. Second, when set up, the .zip file will be put on a server somewhere somehow. I will also mail out cd-r copies featuring the .zip file to people who request it.

I am very excited about this. Please give me some feedback!

Well, my music work has been going along better during the past few weeks than it ever has before. I've been keeping busy working on it, and sending certain song files to certain collaborators. Also, collaborators welcome, so email me, AIM me, or post a comment if you'd like to collaborate. 

Life has been very boring. The job in Houston ended in October, I think it was, so I've been that long without income. The next job isn't supposed to start until after Christmas. Great planning. How am I supposed to buy gifts now? 

So, my everyday life consists of working on music, playing Guild Wars, playing Age of Empires III and all of the expansions that are made for it, going out with friends and hanging out, etc, etc, etc. Nothing spectacular. 

Great films I've watched recently:
Planet Terror
300 (although I also saw it in the theaters, I also own the DVD)
Hostel & Hostel Part Two (Most people hated these, but I found them entertaining)
Pan's Labyrinth 
American Gangster
No Country for Old Men (Which I found to be an AMAZING movie, fuck what some people said.)

Anyways, I'll update again soon."

So far, the album is basically an outline/story of my life. Its pretty crazy, because I've lved a crazy life. But its not necessarily exact, its not an exact story for it. Its not theme album like I said, I'm not at theme album story status yet. Not quite yet.

"event","Well, I've been up here in Fort Worth now working as a welder's helper, pipline work, for about a month. I'm making roughly $1,200 a week, doing real good. Especially for a 20 year old. Life is taking shape for me.

I have my girl, Amber Rhoades, whom I will marry soon enough. 

Everything has turned to the better for me. 

Yall give me a call, I don't care who it is, I miss you all, give me a FUCKING CALL!

1-409-267-9084

I'll have a new computer soon enough. Bear with me ya'll.

Oh yeah, as soon as I get that computer, I'm getting musical equipment, and production will start on my solo EP and LP. No bullshit this time, I will do this album complete before anything is even revealed. No more details right now. This goes to tell you, .drug. is dead, all side-projects are dead, except my solo project and some others I have plans for, and MFS with Peter Bellesario. But my primary focus is my solo EP & album. And this will be the real deal, no more bullshit. You will all see.

Anyways, ya'll call me. I don't care when it is, just call!"

"event","Woke up around 9 AM today and went to wash my dad's truck so we can sell it. He was friends with the guys who ran the lot, so they're helping us sell it by putting it on their lot. People in Iowa are so nice. Its very hard to find people like that anywhere else that I've been. 

Recieved money order from mother. Carton of ciggarettes, and I'd really like to get the SACD re-release of the Downward Spiral, deluxe edition, of course. However, I know I need to make the money last, so I don't know. I'll have to see about this. 

Maybe today I'll get around to posting those pictures. Maybe not. Depends on how I'm feeling later. Right now I feel like shit, as I only got 4 or 5 hours of sleep last night, and have a cold. I'm not used to this freezing weather, either. I'm used to humidity, and 'cold' being 40 some odd degrees. Here, its been in the 30's every day. They tell me it only gets worse from here, which I could have guessed, but didn't really want to. Thank God for this warm jacket dad had. Otherwise, I wouldn't make it. 

I'm feeling better today than I have since all of this shit happened. A lot better. Still depressed, of course, but overall, I'm getting more at ease every day. My mother keeps calling worried as hell, and she needs to slack off. My grandparents call me talking about how they are worried about her, but what the hell am I to do? I'm in another part of the US."

"event","The past days have been hell, as I guess you can imagine. The funeral was Saturday, which was the worst day of this entire past week of depression hell. My father's funeral was a catholic funeral, for whatever reason. I'm obviously not catholic, and neither is my sister. The priest or whatever they call him was telling us that we weren't to get on our knees because it was only ""full fledged catholic business"". I broke down the whole time. I tried to maintain composure, but knowing I'll never be able to hear his voice or sit and speak to him anymore is terrible. I broke down so many times during the funeral, falling to the floor in tears. I thank God my sister and niece were there to help me out. He tried so hard to get me up here to see him, and its terrible that it had to take this to get me here. I was coming, he knew I was coming when I spoke to him before he went in. Then, hours later, I got that call from my sister. At least I knew that he completely believed that I was coming. I still feel guilty, and this is something that will probably rest on my concious for a very long time.

The past few days have been very depressing. We've been having to go through his house and get everything, and then decide who gets what. Also, having to argue with his girlfriend over certain things. Not really arguments, just little disagreements I guess you can say. My sister and I however have no arguements. I really don't like the idea of fighting over my dead father's belongings. I've been letting my sister handle all of that, and she's been more than good to me about it, of course. He had no life insurance, so we're having to sell his truck to pay for the funeral, and to pay off his debts (which are very little). Walking in that house and seeing his stuff is very haunting. I get an empty feeling, and often have to go outside and get away for a few minutes just to keep from breaking down again.

I guess I'm more at peace now, knowing he's not going through the hell he was on Earth, but it still hurts, and I guess it always will.

I'm back for a long time now. I've got my father's computer to use, and I'll be on my sister's while I'm in Iowa. I can't get AIM to work on her computer for whatever reason, so if you'd like to reach me, email me at the same old address: jsavka@hotmail.com. The cellphone does not work due to no service in Iowa. 

Peter, I'll probably give you a call when I can. Tonight's not good, as I have to go and get my father's TV out of his house with my sister's boyfriend, Nate, and all kinds of other shit. 

New pictures will be available soon. Of nieces, nephews, and myself.

I'm going to try and keep in touch this time. Try to keep active."

I didn't sleep at all last night. Just couldn't sleep. I need my damn prescriptions filled. I'm missing that Trazodone. And Adavant. But thats another story.

Heh, someone reviewed one of my songs on ACIDplanet and told me my picture made me look like the gayest person on Earth. 

Two tests tonight. Nutrition Science [of course, I do these every week, an easy test for the count!] and Social Studies, or whatever they call it now days. I think I'll pass them both.

Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on Nintendo Game Cube is a horrible game. Do not buy it if you own a GameCube [I don't think anyone that reads this does]. However, that Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee game is pretty damn fun. Chris and I play it a lot, its kind of addictive. 

I think I'm going to be able to see TKK/Pigface as well. Chris wants to go. We'll probably have the money to go. Then, I'll go see Ministry with Melissa and her boyfriend on the 8th and be a happy little shit. A happy little shit with a busted lip probably. 

Once again, Parliament lights are the best ciggarettes there are. I thought they were cheaper than Marlboro's, but their not.

I think sometimes I will take the weird attractions and living on the outskirts compared to this thing. Idk what I&#39;m even in right now. It&#39;s like adulthood with childish antics. I think sometimes its a life lesson that i&#39;m not quite picking up on. But then if im not learning anything then wats the point? It&#39;s all waste then right? That&#39;s how I think at least. But I guess that doesn&#39;t stop the lesson. I think that just stops the person from trying anymore.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />"

"event","<p>So it's been like forever and two days since i've written on this thing but I felt like I really needed a place to just write freely about all the things I'm thinking about right now. I'm so angry at her. I mean not only did she go see her on my birthday but now on our one year she can go give her dog shots but can't stop by to say hi.&nbsp;I am so disappointed right now that I'm near tears. Like I was thinking that she would do something thoughtful and come to my work just to see me and say happy anniversary cause thats something I would have done for her. Or even come by at midnight just to say she say me even for a second. But no she can make time to give her &quot;friend's&quot; dogs shots. I don't know what to think or what to feel right now. I kinda want to explode but dont want to get it all over my laptop. I guess thats what I get for having high expectations right. <br /><br />&quot;Could not even tell me truthfully and you wanna know how that makes me feel....I can't feel anything&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center"">I'm beginning to notice<br />how much this feels <br />like a waking limb<br />pens and needles<br />nice to know you<br />goodbye</p>"

"event","So a lot has happened&nbsp;since I've last update on this&nbsp;thing. I really dont come here as much as I use to so I figured&nbsp;I should make an update of the news. Umm well where should I start...

So&nbsp;I'm no longer single. That's a happy&nbsp;point&nbsp;in my life. Some of you know who it is and some of you don't. But I promise this person is amazing. I have wanted to be with them for over 3 years now and it has finally happened and I couldn't be happier than I am now.&nbsp;It's funny because James and I were talking and he mentioned how originally I said I wouldn't be dating anyone my senior year and&nbsp;how that changed. But it's ok because my baby is worth it.&nbsp;

I'm a Celebritee(sp?) at work. In&nbsp;understandable terms, my boss, managers, and coorporate are taking me out&nbsp;to dinner to reward me for doing such a great job during the holidays. I'm so excited because I've never met coorporate so this shall be interesting. I can't wait to meet Steve. I heard he is pretty amazing so this should be fun.

I'm done with finals thank goodness because those were stressin me out big time. I put my baby through so much this week but then my boo got sick so I had to be nurse and not worry so much and I think that really helped in the long run.

Life is just finally starting to settle down and fix itself. I'm happy. I'm in anger management and as much as I think it isn't working it really is. I joke about it and all that but it really does work and is making me a slightly calmer person. My relationship is great cause I have someone that really cares for me and shows me that everyday. Bought me a rose after my first final. It was so sweet so I bought them a singing frog to make my baby feel better. Things are just getting together for me and I think finally things might all fall into place."

"event","So you know when you have just&nbsp;finished this really indepth conversation were in some intense and strange sense things maybe came together and yet you are still somwhat still a blur that you aren't sure if your&nbsp;words still make sense?

Yeah thats me.

I'm so sick and tired of labels.&nbsp;Yeah that's right labels. Why must we label the society we live in by different classes or different&nbsp;social standings. I hate labels.&nbsp;If you dress in mostly black why must you be punk or a goth? Since when did you have to fit that category just because you like the color black? So what if you like the color pink and wear it a lot...is it still wrong to listen to death metal and rock out to pearl jam? SO what if you like chicks and dudes?&nbsp;What is wrong with just being able to share the love with&nbsp;everyone?&nbsp;Why is our society&nbsp;so hellbend on making sure&nbsp;everyone is labeled? You're a goth, you're a queer, you're a freak, what the hell? I hate that conformist made this acceptable and now everyone feels that though they know it's wrong it is ok to do. I hate how&nbsp;I have&nbsp;found myself in the situation of actually being&nbsp;part of this retard fad of labels&nbsp;because the people&nbsp;around me where doing it too. I refuse to be another socially retarded American that can't think for themselves and is scared to&nbsp;step outside the&nbsp;norm just because a label might be&nbsp;attached to my ass as soon as&nbsp;I do. I'm sorry that I like to wear pink&nbsp;every now and then, and nirvana still makes me smile. That when I'm sad I put on&nbsp;indie music and wear&nbsp;blue.&nbsp;So what&nbsp;if I feel some&nbsp;old school rap music is ok and that&nbsp;everyone once in a while&nbsp;a dumb&nbsp;upbeat song from some rap artist whose name starts with ""lil"" is decent enough to me to pay attention too. Stop fucking labeling people.&nbsp;it's not the cool thing to do. In fact it's so&nbsp;fucking retarded that&nbsp;in&nbsp;order&nbsp;for it to be socially acceptable everyone has to agree to it. If at least a hand ful of people will step up enough to acknowledge when&nbsp;they mistakenly do a random act of labeling and know that it isn't right...maybe this world would be decent enough to live in.

So here it goes. I'm&nbsp;Brittany. I'm black. I like all music. My wardrobe is a minor reflection of who&nbsp;I am on a day to day basis. I like boys. I like girls. I don't like to be labeled as gay, lesbian, bi, confused&nbsp;or any&nbsp;other shit people&nbsp;want to sugar coat my life. I am who&nbsp;I am. I'll be who I want to be. And there is no label in this world that shall ever be able to some up me. So put that in your pipe and smoke it."

"event","&nbsp;so yeah my new years was pretty fun. Went to Amandas. And if anyone has ever been to one of her parties you know exactly how it was. Lots of grinding, sweating, yelling and much much more. Originally wasn't having that great of a time but Shmone got me into the spirit and I ended up not wanting to leave. I had so much fun even if my ex was there being the biggest ass there is. But....It was still great. I feel so much closer to Money now. And...I got my new year's kiss. lol yay....actually I got 2....one of each you could say.

Can't wait to really get into this year because there is so much to look forward to. Graduating, Valentine's day, Prom, Moving out....the list is endless.&nbsp;

Adrian and I aren't currently talking so there goes my boy. But oh well we will see what happens. I have a cute girl in mind right now.

I'm trying to break the cycle guys so just bare with me. No more repeats of the past 2 years. Some of you know what that means. You might have to help me.

And&nbsp;I think I am finally ready for my first tatoo. It will be chinese characters for inner beauty. Once the snow lets up and I get more spendin cash....it's going down. Also another piercing is in the works. I just feel like this year is all about what I want. And those two things are on the list so there we have it."

"event","<strong>""If you let go, I'll let go tonight.""<br /></strong><br />So I am pretty excited about how things are going so far. Haven't really had much time to spend&nbsp;with people lately but that's not completely my fault. I have been working my ass off like crazy because we are&nbsp;all working everday&nbsp;at Celebration and so you do what&nbsp;you have to do. My check however will be huge and for that I'm excited.&nbsp;So&nbsp;thanks to this large check I am starting my trip fund. Late I know but I had emergencies come up and medical stuff came up&nbsp;so that&nbsp;funding had to go to other things but now i'm&nbsp;on track and things&nbsp;have calme down a bit so I think I will be ok.&nbsp;<br /><br />Love life=complicated. I really adore&nbsp;this boy. Everyday I feel myself getting closer to him and yet I still have to be so far away. If only there was just&nbsp;moment in time where everything didn't matter and it could just happen as it may. *sigh*<br /><br />Anger Management starts soon. I am truly&nbsp;happy about this. It will be something new for me and&nbsp;who knows how the outcome might&nbsp;turn out. It could truly change my life and that could be something new I'm ready for. Just&nbsp;imagine...me...super nice. All calm and collected. Wow.<br /><br />So&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I'm going to take up kickboxing again. I read that in this new class&nbsp;I need to channel my anger somewhere so I&nbsp;figured why not. I don't know if I will have time for it but I will have to make time somehow or something&nbsp;like it. If I find a great class and if anyone wants to sign up with me then&nbsp;let me know and I will get&nbsp;back to you.<br /><br />Even though we havent been&nbsp;on break that long I feel like it has been a lifetime. Away from the&nbsp;stress of school and the drama of people just to finally connect with the things I need to connect with. Some inner&nbsp;peace even. It's really good for me. I&nbsp;get to do my&nbsp;yoga now&nbsp;and it has been a really big thing. Believe it or not bending yourself into numerous positions that might appear uncomfortable and may cause slight discomfort is&nbsp;really rewarding.&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all things have been going well and I'm hoping this is the new path that I take with&nbsp;me into the new year. Things should only be looking up from here. Besides I'm almost out of high school and that in&nbsp;itself brings a smile to my face and&nbsp;a song in my head.&nbsp;<br /><br />OH!! I almost forgot I'm&nbsp;putting together a senior video. Not the one that will be shown at graduation but a personal one of&nbsp;just&nbsp;the people that have impacted me and I plan to&nbsp;have a viewing of it the last week of school. So I will be stalking everyone&nbsp;with a camera. Just act natural.&nbsp;"

I hate how much one song can just overtake me to a point where I'm relating every aspect of my life to it and finding too many similarities for me own liking. Take that as you wish. We all know that we have a similar situation in our lives to that song or have at one point.<br /><br />I don't want to start having feelings anymore for him.

The only problem is that I truly can't let him go and I hate that I love him so because the people that truly know me actually know that I never got over this kid.

It's always a surprise, to be with you.""<br /><br /></strong>That is directed to someone in specific but no one will ever guess who including that person and that's the way I want it.<br /><br />I hate when my emotions get crazy. Damn you Depo. I will be better in a week or so. Good times to come.<br /><br /><strong>""I ask myself is there something left, I hold my breath and I wonder.

"event","He was like a dream. Like this image you have that feels so real but as soon as you wake up the harder you try to remember the more it slips away. That's what if felt like to be without him. The more she focused on the amazing times she had with him the more he tended to slip away. So she lied to herself. Push her loving memories to the back of her mind in order to keep what was left of him to herself. She knew that deep down she would never have him again and she probably move on and yet something just couldn't let go of the sweet boy of her dreams. That boy that made her laugh without trying and kept her up for days just thinking of his silly hair or goofy laugh. To her he was unlike any other boy in her life, he was majestic.&nbsp;

Their time together was short lived yet felt like a lifetime. Everyday she would wake up just to see him and fall asleep only to keep in a little bit longer. They expressed their emotions for each other in the strangest of ways that many people found quite unorthidox but she didn't care and neither did he. They kissed with passion and hugged with gratitude both just overjoyed to have found someone that cared for them with the deep emotions they had longed for. But as said before their time together was short lived. She angry ways and his shortness of patience finally drove them apart and the joy the girl once knew was gone.&nbsp;And though she never forgot about him and wrote of him daily, he never quite felt the same for her again. The love he once felt for her began to die and she as well began to die with it.&nbsp;

Many have been told of very few dying of a broken heart but she was one of the few. Her heart in actuality didn't die however her spirit did and with her spirit went her desire to live. This poor girl felt as if her world had crumbled beneath her leaving her nowhere to place her feet. So, with the knot of a rope and a single tear, she released her body of her dead spirit leaving behind a note merely stating one thing, ""I lived for his love and now I shall die without it."""

"event","<p>Spring break has had so many ups and downs and dips and twists and turns it is crazy. I've found this song last night that I had been searching for but I found it as I was crying and it's an emo song so great timing. Last night was truly crazy. I had a great time with Jill, Carrie, and Jimmy because we can just sit in Steak N'&nbsp; Shake and be retarded and have everyone ine the place judge us like we are dumb and still have the best time ever. That's why I love those guys. I dont know what I would do if I didnt have them in my life. But then my night ended with me crying. I don' t want to get into detail about it but mucho thanks to the ppl that tried to make me feel better and were there for me. Especially Carrie like I would have just lost it if it wasn't for her. She kept me level headed as much as she could and kept my feet on the ground when I just wanted to jump off a bridge so mucho thanks to her.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm talking to my old best friend again and it's so great to be able to talk to her again because despite all the drama we have been through I've missed her so much. I'm going to her house after kareoke tonight so yay!!!<br /><br />Had lunch today with my mom and Jimmy and of course she did the mom thing by asking him every question she could think of then sharing my 2 big bad stories about the only 2 times I've actually gotten in trouble. They were embarrasing a little but then again it was good to see her take to him well. She's a really nice lady if you are nice to her first. He was really quiet though so she had something to say about that and she thinks he should talk more. But besides that all went well so I'm happy about that. Now we just have to go through the dinner with him and my dad. That will be a hell of a lot harder than lunch with mom. I hope we can all survive that one.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are some lyrics from the song I just found.....<br /><br />""I'm not feeling so well, maybe we could just sit for a spell. And make amends-it depends on my injury, I dont wanna be me.""<br />""I'm not feeling so sure, it would help if you offered a cure. If I wait it's too late for the remedy, I don't wanna be me.""<br />""You won't save me, cause I""m not the fortunate one. So don't blame me, if I decided to go hide or instead just run""</p>"

"event","<p>So I'm addicted to this song right now. It's called anonymous by bobby valentino and most of you probably haven't heard of it before but yes it is a great song.</p><p>So this spring break has taken a turn for the best. It started out pretty crappy with me having a full case of the flu but I've noticed I get a lot of well needed thinking done when I'm sick so I was very productive during this time. As the week progresses I've gotten to a very calm point now where I am in a happier state. I made amends with someone that was truly my other half because for 7 years she was my best friend ever so today I talked to her for the first time in months and we are ok again. I've seen so many of my old friends like Amber, David I even saw karys today at celebration I didnt see her at first but she stopped me and said hi it was a cool weird.</p><p>So I've come to this point in my relationship where I think we will truly make it for a while. I mean we've gotten passed the evil 2 months, the drinking issue, even the touching thing isn't a problem which everyone said was going to be so HA in your face. We're doing good though I mean we are on understanding terms, there is still tons of mystery which is another thing I need in a relationship because I dont want to know everything there is to know about someone all at once. I want to continue to learn things and believe me there is so much more to know. But so far as us as a whole we're doing good. Besides my random moodswings which are getting under control and my clinginess which I still need to work on. I dont have a pic of him in my wallet, we dont have a secret hand shake, he doesnt have his very own ringtone, and I dont cook him pancakes or vice versa so sorry gym class heroes but besides that we are great. I truly have come to love him with all my heart which is something hard since it has been broken so many times but I don't think he will hurt me so hey what is there left to lose?</p><p>Some parting lyrics for you all....</p><p>""For a moment I almost lost everything, for a moment I forgot about memories. But I wonder and realize how much you mean to me, for a moment I almost lost you and me.""</p><p>""And I know this much is true, baby you have become my addiction. I'm so strung out on you, can barely move but I like it, and it's all because of you, yeah it's all because of you. And it's all because I can never get enough, you're the sweetest drug.""</p>"

I've gotten quite a bit done so far and the doc has me on 100 different meds so I should be well by monday or tuesday.&nbsp; Oh and this is a secret so no one tell but......I'm getting my tatoo this summer but SHHHHHH no one is suppose to know any by no one I mean my parents so yeah. But yeah I'm getting my I'm so excited I'm getting it while I'm away so they really wont know when I get it. Oh and my abs yeah they hurt from coughing so I better be losing some weight from all this exercise of coughing and running up and down stairs so sweat off the fever. Yup thats right....i'm sweating off my fevers so I can cut down on the meds I take. Call me Ms. Resourcefull.&nbsp;

I've done some thinking while lying in bed for most of yesterday and I realized that I'm great. Not the I'm great in a ""I""m amazing and no one is better than me so take that"" type of way. More of a ""I""m great because my life doesnt suck as much as I thought and I have so many reason to be happy and so many people I love that I can't help but be great"" type of great. I mean I have great friends like Jillian, who for some reason I've become attached to lately....Margo, who again for some reason I havent grown away from since middle school.....Andrew, who is seriously my other half and not in a relationship type of way but in a way that keeps me from doing bad and stupid things.....Carrie, who recently I've become ubber attached to and I pretty love that girl to death....even Ash, who currently I'm not in the best state with but when we are ok we have a great time together and she can be a really good friend when you need her to be.&nbsp; Plus I have an amazing boyfriend who actually cares when I'm sick and still kisses me when I am cause you know thats love right there. Despite our off and on fighing I really think this last big fight we had might have been the one to put us on track and I really can't see myself with anyone other than him and there is no one I would rather be with&nbsp;plus according to my doctor he is my medicine so I have to keep him around.&nbsp;

So yeah I guess being sick is truly the only time I""m in a condition to really stop and look at everything around me and realize I'm&nbsp; great. Great friends, Great boyfriend, Good Family what else to you truly need?

"event","February 26, yup that was the last time i updated this thing. I swear I have so much to do in life that I never have time to sit down and write about it. Maybe if I did I could end up like that movie Bridget Jones' Diary. That was a good movie with a very sweet ending. Somehow I dont see me ending up on the corner of a street in a robe and tank with undies of a leopard print chasing some guy in the snow. However, who am I to predict the future? Anyways back to the regular scheduled programmed. Yeah so my life in a nutshell.....I say that a lot btw if you haven't noticed I like to put my life in a nutshell....why a nutshell you may ask? Beats me. Maybe it's because if it's in a shell it doesnt look as messy or disorganized rather than if it was just laid out on a table. Maybe I'm just over-analyzing this small and insignifant detail. 

My life in a nutshell...well lets see. Homelife=horrible  school=horrible   friends=semi-horrible   relationship=not too bad   personal perception=horrible

Well according to that data doesn't seem like I'm doing too good now does it? In all life could be worse. I mean it could be like when I was younger and believe me it was much more horrible then because I had a lot less than I do now so I guess I'm at the positive end of the number line. Yay me. I've been doing some evaluating lately on my life. I do one good evaluation about every month or so according to the time I have left after my 28 days of hard labor. This month I noticed that I really dont trust well. That's my biggest issue. I don't trust the people around me, those that know me, man sometimes I dont trust myself and in some ways that is a good thing because if you dont trust then you cant get hurt however in some ways that is bad. If you are still reading this right now I applaud you for have the attention span to read all of this. Furthermore I congradulate you for putting up with my ramblings and short comings as a writer. I'm sure someone of a much more novelist nature could do better but I guess I will do. So yeah I think I might have to start doing something about this nature that I am in. Maybe stop being so hard on the people around me because I can almost promise you that after we graduate I probably wont see most of these people again so why not liev life in the moment?

The answer....unsure. Like you don't know if you are mad, sad, depressed, happy, confused, or all of the above. I'm just existing right now. It's really weird like I feel like I should be floating/hovering above my computer or something. Who knows...maybe a few pain killers will give me sensations back. Or falling down the stairs which ever comes first. 

I annoy you I'm sorry I can't help it. It's that girly side of me that only comes out when I'm trying insecure and that right now my friend is me. It is beyond my control sometimes. But I will take this opportunity to state that I was right about you getting annoyed with me because of it. Yeah...life=shitty.

Why must the one close group of friends of mine have this problem now? I mean we all need each other more than ever right now because face it guys we are going through some shitty stuff right now and so we should be having more dancing in Ash's basement instead of chatroom hate crimes against humanity.

"event","So I'm reading these entries and my current group of friends talk about how they miss their days as a cult. You know what I miss....when they were in a cult I was safe and warm at James' house hanging out with his family and watching movies and drinking grape faygo. That's what I miss...that security. And I know for a fact that this entry will be misinterrupted into I miss him but that's not it. I miss that comfort, security and love I use to have. That feeling of nothing existing in the world except me and the person I was with. I really miss that feeling and I haven't had that in a while. I'm not saying I will never have it but I do miss just spending time alone with that someone, not saying one word and just laying there in his arms not worried about all the stress around me. I miss that. A lot.

I don't know what this is or where it came from but it is not a good thing and only bad can result from this. I was bitter last night and it has developed into being not happy. I don't like not being happy. I love being happy but for some reason something is keeping me from being in that state. Maybe it has something to do with what time of the month it is. And no I'm not talking about the girly stuff. I'm talking about Valentine's Day. Yeah it is coming up pretty quickly. What does that mean....idk. I had so many plans for this one and then worst came to worst and so those were shattered. I mean I should be excited right...I think I should be.

THURSDAY

So we all went bowling. Omg the girls totally owned the boys. I mean we were on it. We had amazing names. We decided that we were just too sexy for that game. It was incredible. Then I got asked out in the most romantic way. Absolutely romantic. So I went to bowl and after my turn was done I went to look at the screen for the score and the names read, "" Go Out With Me Brittany"". I totally said yes. Then afterwards went working out with Ash. Got completely ambushed but this lady. Very scary. Then out to dinner with Ash, Eric, Reggie, Ceddie and Josh. So there was this table of girls behind us so we all got Josh to go over to them and talk to them and if they just completely shut him down say he only came to talk to them for his friend Ash. So he goes over and asks them what school they went to and they said, "" We're grown up"". Omg the best thing ever. So yeah we then went to mall, hung out with Bianca and Brandon. Josh tried on some chaps. Simply crazy. I have pics if you wanna see. Then I finished my night at Amanda's house. So funny. Her and Debbie are hularious.

FRIDAY

So the day started off bad because of the waiting for the carpet cleaners to get to my house so I could leave. Then got really really bored so I went to Amanda's house. She wasn't in a good mood I tried all I could to make her feel better but let's face it....I'm sick. Not much I can do. So then I went and picked up Margo and took her to Ash's house for girls night. OMG....we are so gansta. We listened to black music while we got movies and ice cream and Beaners. Oh and rolled down the window while listening to In The Jungle. Yeah....you can say it. WHITE! So after that we went back and pigged out on pizza and ice cream. Effie came over and that was fun. Then Jessie (with a penis) came over and his car broke down. Kind of funny but then he did something horrible so he's now cut off. Then we watched movies until Jill got there. Then we decided to play music and make up dance moves to them. Btw you have to ask the four of us to do our dance step to Ignition Remix you'll love it. So then yeah we became J.A.M & Boobs. Yeah that's right you guessed it. I'm boobs. So yeah now I'm here. See wasn't I right. Simply incredible."

"event","Seems like everyone knows someone who is having surgery lately. My sister just had her surgery and is in her recovery period now. There are some good and some bad times for her but I'm proud of her for handling it so well. TO be an 8 year old and have surgery and take it the way she is...well it's a good thing. She's doing much better than I did....I had my first surgery at the age of 7 and believe me I was anything but good about it. I was horrible and my recovery lasted extra time because I was so bad about it. But the doctor says that she'll be back up and running like normal in a couple of weeks. Today is a bad day. We were warned about the ups and downs but today is a down. She's not feelin well and doesn't look to well. THe best we can do is keep her stable and keep using her medication. It's been tough but all good things come with time."

Gave another game the ol' slip I see. During the first inning of the game, I tried a reverse play...however I got hoed so I stopped that and tried a different play. That one backfired on me as well so now I'm left at the 50 yard line all over again. The football analogy is back into play.

Thanks Ally for the suggestion. Aliens might be the better way to go...if only one of those Rosewell boys were still around. (Old T.V. days coming back into memory.)

"event","So this weekend has been very up and down. My dad had to be rush to the hospital and he is still in. Not fun. My one month was this weekend with Jimmy. Fun but it was the same day that my dad had to be rushed in...result...not fun. Went to the movies with James and that was fun. Movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but we made it funnier than it was so that was a great thing. Went and visited my dad everyday this weekend which was kind of sad. James went with me to visit yesterday which made my dad smile. They laughed which made me smile. So yesterday I smiled. Today my friend is sad...not fun. I wish I could make things better but I can't. Recieved a text message that creeped me out a little from my boyfriend. lol.Well that's my weekend and today. L8er"

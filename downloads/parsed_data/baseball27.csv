"event","Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight
I'll put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light

Just don't forget to
Think about me
And I won't forget you
""I'll write you once a week"", she said

Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game
Then I must have missed the kick off

Don't depend on me
To ever follow through on
Anything, but
I'd go through Hell for you and

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me

I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class and
She put up with my friends
I acted like an ass

I'd ditch my lecture
To watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture
Still hanging in her locker?

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful

I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful"

So before we leave kevin and V.K stop by autumns and i talk to them for like 5 minutes and then me staci and autumn go down to grand haven.We get there and we walk the strip and then we get down to the lake and as soon as were coming back it starts to rain, we would of got back earlier if we didnt watch a lil kid with his cool balloon but it was worth it. The whole time one the pier we were walking autumn was freakin out beacuse i was close to the water and she thought i was gonna jump in jus like when i was in the car goin down the highway i would open the door and she would freak out. So we walk back to the car all wet and we go to some cindy girls house, one of staci's friends and go there and i get my ass whooped by her sister in need for speed.So we leave and it starts to thunder storm and the car ride home i get a head massage from autumn, the best one ever may i add!But anyways u cant leave out leah and lora, yeah the update for today, leah called me adorable so i said something stupid so i think she is mad at me, and alex said me and her had a thing going on...haha...but anyways thats all...but i do miss kayliegh very much, i miss ya babe!ight im out

So i dunno...people r gay...exspecially some girls that i shall not mention but im not gonna get into that.

"event","a few years ago i was obsessed with buying movies! i don't know why, but i just bought way too many dvds. if i could find something i remotely like for $5&nbsp;i was all over it. i also tried to replace all my vhs movies with dvd versions. i gave up when blue ray appeared as i don't want to have to restart the collection. again. sadly, i spent a lot of money on movies i don't watch enough of. or have never watched. still in the wrapper. oops. when i moved in the summer of 2009 i just put all the movies on my big dvd shelf and there was really no order. a couple weeks ago i decided it was time to organize them. i alphabetized them all and now i'm overwhelmed with what to watch when i decide to watch something. i came up with a plan. i'm going to watch them all, in alphabetical order. this also means i have to watch some of jason's movies i have for one reason or another, never seen. for instance, 300 is a movie or 2 down the row. we'll see how this goes...

last night i started my journey with 10 things i hate about you. i love this movie! i have seen it many, many times.&nbsp;it is one of the vhs to dvd movies i collected along the way. it was not still in the wrapper. watching it last night brought back so many memories!&nbsp;first off, heath ledger of course!&nbsp;i had forgotten about his awesome accent. so sexy! i love this movie for so many reasons, it's funny, it has an awesome soundrack and the dad is just entertaining. it's a fun movie to look back on the stars and think about where they are now. i always loved joseph gorden levett (sp) in 3rd rock from the sun, so it's fun to see him in movies now and see how far he's come since that little alien kid. julia stiles of course, probably the biggest star to come out of this movie aside from heath. i wanted her wardrobe after i first saw this movie. i did think larissa oleynik (sp) would have made it further in her career. sidenote, also like her in the baby sitter's club. and then there's gabrielle union. she's so young in this movie, but she's still so pretty today, like she hasn't aged. i too thought she'd have a bigger career by now, though she is well known. 

of course i have a memory to go along with this movie. my friends and i were going to see it in the theater. i had to meet them there cause i was in college and i lived in a dorm across town from them. i could not find the theater!&nbsp;yes, i get lost, a lot, in a town i've lived in my entire life. when i did finally find the theater the guy wouldn't let me buy a ticket cause the movie had already started and i was too late. so i sat in my car and studied while i waited for my friends to get out.&nbsp;we went to a diner for dinner and they told me all about this great movie and this hot australian guy. i couldn't wait for it to come out on video so i could rent it. 

though this story takes place in 1999 it cracks me up how far we've come in technology in the past 12 years. i had a cell phone at the time. it was big, you were charged by the minutes&nbsp;as you used them&nbsp;and i had it for emergencies. my friends both had pagers. but you couldn't exactly respond to a page right away. so i had no way to tell them why i wasn't in the theater or even find out&nbsp;how to get to the theater.&nbsp;also when the movie came out to rent it was vhs and it was 3 more years til i had a dvd player."

"event","<br />i've been watching a lot of tv lately. mostly cause that's all i have to do with i wait for spring. hehe. here's some random stuff i've noticed. spoiler free.<br /><br />last weekend i watched the first two seasons of <em>greek</em>. i love how this show constantly uses pop culture references. though i do wonder how well the target audience understands them. i mean, it's a show on abc family, but it's not exactly wholesome like<em> full house</em>, or syrupy sweet like <em>secret life of the american teenager</em>. one of my faves it the<em> ferris bueller </em>references in season 2. alan rusk from<em> ferris </em>plays the dean of the college. ashley discuses<em> ferris bueller </em>with him. he's also dating someone named sloane. beaver starts yelling &quot;donna martin graduates&quot; at a protest. cappie uses too many references to even list or remember. jen k refers to her roommate as 'lonelygirl15' when the actress who played jen k also played <em>loneygirl15</em>. when cappie and rebecca logan do a study together cappie is case # 8675309. casey and&nbsp;even watch and episode of<em> fraiser </em>and the girl who plays casey is kelsey grammer's daughters&nbsp;there's more...<br /><br />*these may be considered spoilers if you're very anal about spoilers* speaking of beyond the target audience, <em>one tree hill</em> did an episode tribute to john hughes. there was an 80's dance, a forgotten birthday, drunk girl's hair cut off when it was caught, confessions in an autobody car, 'jake ryan' waiting and leaning on a car, they even used jamie to give a nod to<em> home alone</em>. basically, every storyline was related to a john huges movie. and i have to wonder how many people watching actually got it. i like to think that everyone in the world knows and understands the awesomeness that is john huges and his movies. i work with a girl who is 20 and aside from <em>home alone </em>she's never seen any of his movies. i think that is appalling. but i do wonder about younger generations and their lack of film knowledge. <br /><br />one of the things i love about <em>oth</em> is that it's filmed in the same location as <em>dawson's creek </em>(wilmington, nc) so i love seeing the same sets. i look for them. one of my favorites spots is 'the ruins'. that's not really what it's name is, but it's some wildlife conservation area or something. it was used in dc&nbsp;2 times that i can recall and i just finished an ep of oth where it was used for at least the 3rd time. in dc it was the place where pacey first had sex with tamara jacobs and the gang is hanging out on the steps&nbsp;near&nbsp;the water in the last ep of season 4 before&nbsp;dawson leaves for college. in oth it was first where andy's house/estate was. then it was the location of the big party after graduation. this latest time they dumped the ashes in the water near the aforementioned steps in the latest ep. though you're not supposed to realize these are actually all the same places. <br /><br />i'm sure i have more random, trivial things to share, but i can't recall anything else at the moment. <br /><br />"

"event","<br />i wrote this in an email and figured i may as well post it here since it's some of the stuff i have been thinking and discussing lately.&nbsp; this comes from a comment a friend made about being a bit tired of hearing about michael jackson. <br /><br /><p>as for michael jackson, he's no different than elvis, the&nbsp;beatles,&nbsp;kurt cobain, etc. in his iconess. but he is the first icon who has died during this computer generation. when elvis died there was barely tv. when john lennon died there was barely computers let alone the internet. and when&nbsp;kurt cobain died there was mtv. so the mass media and media outlets plus all the internet social sites make&nbsp; the coverage/discussion of&nbsp;mj's death&nbsp;all seem way bigger than it is. but really, he's getting all the same attention the rest of them&nbsp;did. i remember mtv's non-stop 24 hour&nbsp;coverage of&nbsp;kut cobain. i was disapointed in mtv's coverage of jackson. they may not actually play videos on&nbsp;mtv anymore, but that doesn't mean they couldn't have given him a well deserved tribute.&nbsp;just because the last half of&nbsp;mj's life wasn't as dynamic as the first, doesn't mean he&nbsp;shouldn't receive the recognition he deserves. i mean, he does have the #1 selling album of all time. ever.&nbsp;after all these&nbsp;years. it will never be beaten. why? because even if there were an artist as original as michael jackson (which is impossible at this point) because of illegal downloading that&nbsp;album would never be able&nbsp;to sell as many albums as&nbsp;&quot;thriller&quot;.&nbsp;<br /><br />on an non -mj related topic, my bff jessica had her baby! so cute! his name is adam and he has a mohawk!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>"

so far, next season, i'm only going to give the new melrose place and the vampire diaries a try. and glee. let me know if i'm possibly missing something great! 

i still have to catch up one tree hill, ugly betty, desperate housewives and lost. 

speaking of lost, does anyone else get a lost vibe from that missing air france plane? especially now that the pieces weren't for that plane! and what plane did they belong to? how freaking awful! 

a comment about the exit of chad michael murray and hilary burton from oth. i don't think the show will survive without them. i'm not a leyton or peyton fan. so i don't care too much. but i know i'm going to miss the relationship that has grown between lucas and nathan. and i will be sooooo sad without the bff of hayley and lucas. i always wanted them together, but i do like haley and nate. so it's a touch conflict. but i love haley and lucas as bff. plus jamie is going to miss his uncle lucas. *sigh* damn budget cuts!&nbsp;again, i have not seen the last couple eps, so please don't spoil! i do wonder if they will get a proper send off though."

"event","<br />I'm trying very hard to catch up on tv shows. here's a bit on what i've seen. spoilers for those who are behind like me!&nbsp;<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""gossip girl, the office, 90210, supernatural"">Gossip girl: when tv shows based on high school graduate to college there is always that awkward, unrealistic ploy to keep all the characters together. so far gg is doing&nbsp;a&nbsp;good job. i think dan&nbsp;is even now&nbsp;at nyu? just wondering how they'll keep serena in&nbsp;town. i am also wondering how they'll do&nbsp;gossip girl. i mean, she's going&nbsp;to keep tabs on them in&nbsp;college.&nbsp;yet, she's still going to keep tabs in little j and co in high school. it'll be interesting but i do have faith in the writers and all. they learned from their oc mistakes.&nbsp;the season was pretty good. i got kind of bored&nbsp;for awhile in the middle. but the last few eps really saved it. like the return of georgina. haha! i have&nbsp;to say, i absolutely loved blair's prom dress. i didn't like it when she first took it out of the&nbsp;box. i&nbsp;was like, wth is that. but when she had it on and you could actually see it i liked it! i also liked chuck's good and bad coniving to&nbsp;give blair her dream prom. speaking of blair, i really do like who she's evolved into. she isn't the&nbsp;ice cold biatch of the first season. she's just not as snotty and uptight. but she still has her evil streak, so that is nice. so i'm looking&nbsp;forward to&nbsp;what they do&nbsp;with next season. lots of&nbsp;possibilities, hopefully they don't screw it up.&nbsp;<br />as for the spinoff, i think it has/had potential. i&nbsp;haven't heard the final word on it, but i'm guessing it will be a no. i think a show like that would&nbsp;need a pretty big&nbsp;budget.&nbsp;<br /><br />the office: ahhhh!&nbsp;jim and pam! i actually saw this&nbsp;ep&nbsp;live, so i didn't have to catch up on it. i just never wrote anything about it. i loved&nbsp;holly and michael and once again felt badly for michael when he said something about this being part of the story&nbsp;they tell their children on how they ended up together. or whatever. dwight and angela are&nbsp;finding their way back. lol! so&nbsp;cute! andrew&nbsp;bernard seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;getting a bit testy once again. and i don't really remember much&nbsp;else. though&nbsp;the saga that is ryan continues to amuse me.&nbsp;<br /><br />supernatural. i can't believe next season may be the last! but i don't want to them to drag it out and ruin the show either. i felt for sure they boys were going&nbsp;to end this season as enemies. i can't believe they suckered sam so&nbsp;horribly! omg! i didn't see that coming. i was totally fooled into ruby being a&nbsp;decent demon. i'm still holding out hope papa winchester will return to help save the day.&nbsp;i&nbsp;was sad there wasn't as much music this season, but again, budget cuts. and&nbsp;i was sad about the distance between&nbsp;sam and dean. but that only makes them stronger and builds character. so i'm hoping we get some&nbsp;feel good moments next&nbsp;season. but at least this&nbsp;season didn't end&nbsp;with&nbsp;one, or both of them dying.&nbsp;<br /><br />90210: ok,&nbsp;i gave this show&nbsp;a try cause i am a big fan&nbsp;of&nbsp;the original. i'm still waiting for dylan to return. the show wasn't horrible. and anna lyn mccord actually learned how to act by the time the&nbsp;season ended. i liked how they developed the characters. my faves are silver and&nbsp;noah. just because they&nbsp;actually have substance. and of course&nbsp;kelly taylor! lol!&nbsp;so if silver and noah get together i don't think&nbsp;i'd mind it. for some reason&nbsp;noah doesn't sound like his&nbsp;name.&nbsp;hm. adrianna came around, which was cool. she seemed&nbsp;like a character&nbsp;that wouldn't be around much. i'm glad they&nbsp;gave her a storyline and kept her. i really like her and&nbsp;navid. however you spell that. annie's freak out at the party just cracked me up! did she&nbsp;hit someone? was that a person&nbsp;laying on the ground? and who was driving that old mercedes? i'm guessing that one teacher. but i'm also guessing it's someone new. so i got sucked in.&nbsp;it was my fun show for the season. i didn't have one after grey's anatomy stopped being fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><font style=""background-color: #d2d2d2""><br /><br /><br /><br /></font>"

"event","so friday night lights returns tomorrow!&nbsp;omg!&nbsp;so excited! i&nbsp;was unaware&nbsp;of&nbsp;this. there was an article in the paper this morning and it made my day!&nbsp;but then i came to the crashing reality that i haven't finished season 2! eeek!&nbsp;i started watching it when it was airing. then the whole strike thing. i stopped watching tv at that point. some shows i caught up on. i couldn't bring myself to watch fnl cause i was scared it wasn't going to come back this season. then i bought the dvds and started watching them but never finished. then there was that whole direct tv fiasco thing. so i was even more scared. i started thinking if i watched them to prepare for the possibilty they would be on tv now i would jinx it and it would never return! so now i have to watch the majority of the season before it aires tomorrow!&nbsp;

i hate that this wonderful, awesome, bestshowonearth!&nbsp;doesn't get the attention it deserves. even the article in the paper was singing it's praises. and of course mentioned the best, most realistic couple in the history of tv: coach and mrs. coach!&nbsp;

i'll have to look at the dvds to find out how much i need to watch. but i'm sure there are a few eps! 

new office tonight!!! speaking of that, i need to change my office desk calendar. heh. while i'm at i'll share the quote of the day: Ryan wants everything in our company to be about e-mails and IM's.

EDIT: i was discussing x-men at work and was informed that gambit does something with cards. i have never read the comics or anything like that, so i was just watching for taylor. but there is a guy with cards and you can only see half his face. so that would be taylor. gonna have to watch again to check if it is him."

Now <a href=""http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20244637,00.html"" target=""_blank""><font color=""#3459f5"">People magazine</font></a> is reporting on what led the former child star to file for divorce. It looks like Sweetin, who played middle daugher Stephanie Tanner on the long-running sitcom, and soon-to-be-ex-hubby Cody Herpin were running into many of the same problems that regular people have these days: unemployment, unpaid bills and foreclosure. <br /><br />People obtained court documents that Sweetin filed and pulled these excerpts: <br /><blockquote>&quot;Our house is in foreclosure, our water has been shut off twice. Currently, all of our other utilities are overdue,&quot; the actress says in papers filed Nov. 19 in an Orange County, Calif., court, describing the 16-month union as &quot;rocky.&quot; Herpin, a driver and transportation coordinator in the film industry, stopped working after they got married, Sweetin alleges. &quot;[He] kept finding one excuse after another for his failure to even attempt to find employment,&quot; she says. Sweetin, 26, claims the couple were kept afloat financially with Full House residuals and help from their parents. <br /></blockquote>Herpin, for his part, says he was supposed to remain unemployed: <br /><blockquote>&quot;I was the stay-at-home dad, my job was taking care of Zoie,&quot; due to Sweetin's busy schedule, Herpin says. He is seeking sole legal and physical custody of the couple's daughter and spousal support from Sweetin. <br /></blockquote>This was the second marriage for the troubled Sweetin, who struggled with a methamphetamine addiciton in her early 20s.<br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />i was going to comment on this on the comcast forum where i read it, but i decided i didn't want to discuss stuff with strangers. just curious to what everyone's opinion is of the situation. <br /><br />obviously, i don't know the whole story, but sounds like the guy needs to get out and get a job! nothing wrong with a dad staying home and raising the kid(s), but if you're in that much trouble a job is a requirement! good luck getting custody of the kid with no job or income. and apparently a place to live. poor zoie. sucks for her!"

"event","<br />went to target this morning to get samantha who? while it was still on sale for 17.99. and they had office stuff for 1.00 again!&nbsp;yea! i'm probably the last to know this, but i thought i'd share with anyone who may be in the dark with me. <br /><br />the only thing i've actually watched this week is <lj-cut text=""the office"">jim and pam! omg! i was so worried this first ep of the season would find us in the sad state of no jim and pam. like they were on a break or something. but omg! not only are they still together they are now engaged! and jim doesn't think pam wants a long engagement! ah! yea!!! <br /><br />the temp is back! hahaha! too funny. <br /><br />dwight and angela. i think the only thing i really like about angela is that she's uptight and a big hyprcrite. and i do not understand why she is sticking with andy?! but that whole meeting in secret with&nbsp;a boom box is freaking awesome!&nbsp;<br /><br />michael is still a cringe worthy asshole. with a lopsided goatee. glad that is gone now. whew. ripping up those tickets. what a douche. he didn't really bother me til that whole michael klumps thing. <br /><br />i loved the pam on webcam thing. <br /><br />i was so scared when pam kind of blew jim off then he was all worried and wanted to meet for lunch. eek. but it totally worked out! <br /><br />i'm loving the season so far. hope they don't screw it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>now i have to finish watching supernatural, prison break, 90210 and hopefully that is it. nope, fell asleep somewhere in bones. and i must see how that ended! as for grey's anatomy. i didn't finish last season. so as of now, i'm not watching it. but i know when i start reading people's thoughts, etc. on it i'll start again. it just works that way. haha!&nbsp;"

"event","<p>these thoughts come from seeing the preview and looking the cast up on imdb:<br /><br />1. why the hill did they not record the freaking movie on the olympic peninsula rather than oregon?! hello, it's not that far away! i mean, the&nbsp;book takes place in forks, wa, record the flippin' thing in washington! oregon is beautfiful and all that, but it's not the rain forest. there was just too much sun and blue sky in the preview.&nbsp;<br /><br />2. i think i saw some fangirl video of a trailer on youtube, so this may not even be part of the twilight movie. but bella/kristin has blonde hair?! for a part of the preview, the rest was actually dark hair bella style. what's up with that!<br /><br />3. peter facinelli(obviously this is misspelled) as doctor cullen? peter fascindljshdh with blonde hair? huh.&nbsp;<br /><br />4. looking at the pics i can agree with the cast playing the characters they do. except i'm a little weirded out with elizabeth reaser playing um, mrs. cullen.&nbsp;<br /><br />um....that's all i have for now.&nbsp;<br /><br />bones was on tnt last night at it was the one where they go to vegas to investigate that boxer's death and dress up in 50-ish style clothes. so hot!!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />ok, i'm on page like 140 of twilight. so i need to get busy. i'm not going camping now so i won't be getting breaking dawn on sunday. i was gonna do the friday midnight release thing cause i had nothing else planned. but now i may be going to a girls night slumber party thing. so maybe saturday?<br /><br /></p>"

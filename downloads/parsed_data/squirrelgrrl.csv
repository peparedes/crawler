this week has been pretty damn cool.. i graduated on monday which was so much fun.. surprisingly.. the ceremony was boring as hell but the thing afterwards was really cool.. free food, free cookies and free wine even though i am not a wine drinker haha anyways the wine was like sweet flat beer so it was pretty good, and i had too much so i got way tipsy at my graduation haha then jeannene took me to a place that only sells french fries afterwards as part of my graduation present.. that place was awsome:) and then we went to see the tree.. we didnt get home til like 2.. it was insane.. and then tues was zebrahead which was so awsome.. not just awesome because they performed realy good but awseome because I got to see/talk to ther sa and christina for a little while also.. ben gave me a pep talk about being a teacher bc his mom is a teacher.. he went to school with gwen stefani at cal state fulerton in cali and he said he used to see her there.. haha
on another note.. i think gwen has flipped her lid for using the goat song from the sound of music.. i am perturbed about that.. how dare she ruin the goat song with that shitty song she just came out with that sounds like black eyed peas on crack.. 
christina i have been watching the sound of music every nite.. i am on a sounbd of music kik.. i know i am really pathetic/lame lol
i really have to get ready for class.. 
I cant wait til i am done for this semester.. not just because i am sick of school but bc i really need to spend more time at the marina.. i cant wait til my grandpa comes home from the hosptial.. I keep waiting for life to get easier but i dont think it is ever going to..
maybe when i get a job life will be a little easier.. school sucks.."

She wore faded jeans and soft black leather 
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather 
When she needed me I wasn't around 
That's the way it goe s, it'll all work out 

There were times apart, there were times together 
I was pledged to her for worse or better 
When it mattered most I let her down 
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out 

It'll all work out eventually 
Better off with him than here with me 

It'll all work out eventually 
Maybe better with him than here with me 

Now the wind is high and the rain is heavy 
And the water's rising in the levee 
Still I think of her when the sun goes down 
It never goes away, but it all works out"

2nd I have fallen in love with a 2004 pickup truck and its still not sold.. it would be an almost new car for me.. yet i just bought the 2000 blazer.. i kinda like my new blazer but the truck is so damn cool i love it i love it.. 
what do you think? its a 2004 extended cab, 5 speed manual, 4 cylinder, with only 37,000 miles.. its so beautiful.. but its 13000 and not worth that much so i have to try to jew the guy down.. id buy it in a heartbeat if it was worth that, but since its not i have issues buying it.. time shall tell.. after all its still a base model work truck...

memories cannot just be erased.. you know that and I know that.. the least we can do is offer each other our friendship..cant u just forgive? im not asking you to forget...

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
...People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess

i decided to do a finding nemo theme in my blazer
im in the middle of cleaning my room b4 i had to go out to eat with my grandmothers friends, and i found a bunch of old pics from high school when me and ther sa went to pa with erin. good times good times ther sa remember the coconut that laur got me from shop and save and i carried the damn thing the entire way home on the train
i think i am gonna treat myself to an ipod.. cuz i need more music in my blazer and i think it would make more sense to hook up an ipod than hook up the 6 cd changer
elsie is my new pet plastic cow that permanently lives in the back of my truck, yesterday she got a new red bow and it made her happy
i need to go pump out my boat b4 it sinks bc of the rain
my grandmas friends discussing penguins having sex has disturbed me.. apparently its more beautiful when penguins have sex than when humans do bc its less violent.. they ""nuzzle"" 
i almost died laughing today when i took jean in the truck and the headliner fell on her and she got her white shirt covered in black dust.. that still makes me giggle
i  must go finish cleaning my room while its still crappy out so i dont have to when its beautiful out and i want to go clamming
my race car has no brakes right now and i tookk it for a ride the other day and i had to jump in front of it to stop it and i almost killed myself... i will NEVER try to stop a moving vehicle again by jumping in front of it

Then probably work and law school or just law school. I feel like i have accomplished quite a bit so far..when u get to a certain age you reflect on your life, and examine what youve accomplished. I think i am pretty content so far, there are still a million and one other things id like to do.. 
Im going to Bunger surf right now, gonna go check out some surfboards.
Im gona probably start going surfing alot in the next few weeks.

So for all 2 of you who actually may read this, would I be a better lawyer or social studies teacher running the marina on the side? I think that my friends would know me better than myself, so its up to you guys.

ther sa i promised we would hang.. we gonna have to put that off til ur back from ur vacation, and i have to finish 3 papers this week.. so im a lil screwed... christina i fucking miss u.. lauren u fell off the face of the earth...

this is just a random thought for the day.. i hate being owned by what owns me. Hence why i love my 1988 s10 pickup with 167,594 miles on it... if anything happens to that i shall put a new motor in it.. its my 30mpg baby.. i can run over anything in that car.. its wonderful
last week i got puled over in it doing 60 in a 35. Weird that i get pulled over in a car that has top speed of 65 when i never got pulled over in my trans am or camaro.. ironic.. i got out of the ticket because i told the cop that i thought someone from dunkin donuts was in the bed of my truck and i was frandtically looking for a flashlight so i wasnt aware of my speed.. its true. i thought the spanish man wanting a dollar was in my bed... i have 4 cars right now.. someone please help me get rid of 2... ahh i have to sell my blazer and my 79 camaro.. ther sa u havent seen my 87 camaro .. 
im starting a race team this year.. jean wants me to name is ""quick clits"" i dont like that name.. my 87 is black with silver racing stripes and a cowl induction hood.. my goal.. is to be a pro race car driver.. and i shall be just wait and see.. my car will be in the 11 second range this time next year, over break i am so reading my how to modify small block 350's book.... 

i must finish my french revolution paper now, then im off to do my enlightenment paper.. 
 
the hell is almost over... 

so what does everyone think about aprils new idea about being a teacher and running the marina as well? its my life calling, what a great idea!!!!!!!"

"event","this has got to be the worst week of my life so far... for starters I got into a car accident with the car that i just sold.. the 86 trans am that is.. i was rear ended at full speed while i was stopped... which is bullshit, now i have to wait til the stupid insurance company for the jerk that hit me to pay for the damage so i can get rid of the car. 
most importantly, the party that is supposed to celebrate saltairs 40th anniversary along with my grandpas 80th bday has been postponed until sat.(it was supposed to be friiday) that doesnt sound like such a big deal does it? Well it is. I have been working my ass off with jeannene to clean up the marina. i havent touched my boat or waverunner, now the stupid party is going to be a hardcore flop. I am so upset b.c  c dawg cant play on sat. this makes me so sad...we have played the marina party for the past 3 years now.. its like a sign of murr growing.. it was our first show..what makes me even sadder is i dont even know if we are going to have another marina party next year.... 
this week i seriously want to crawl in hole and cry....
this week sucks
somebody please say something to cheer me up...Everythign sucks right now..."

"event","so yesterday I wore my shirt on inside out, rather than changing it I kept it on backwards b/c its bad luck to switch it during the course of the day. So I went to my moms bank, was there for like a 1/2 hour and someone she works with told me ur shirts on inside out. I told her i cant change it cuz its bad luck and she was like yea right.. (i really dont believe in this superstitious stuff, i was just too lazy to change) and like 1 minute later the lady was walkin by the window and she saw my car getting a ticket for not putting money in the meter, I ran out like a bat outta hell and was like""o shit i totally forgot Im so sorry"" and the dude was like its ok, and he stopped writing the ticket... That was my first instance of good luck yesterday, 
2. I went to the DMV to get my 79 camaro registered just for the hell of it, and the lady first told me there was no way she could do it cyz my title was ripped. I told her i didnt need one and she ignored me pretty much. she said i had to go back to connecticut to get a title reissued. So she brought it to her superviser and her superviser yelled at her saying to read whas in front of her and ps my car is now registered. 
IRONICALLY... the day i decided to get my camaro registered after letting it sit for 2 months, I get a phone call from some kid that saw a sign in pep boys saying he wants to come look at my trans am. . I took him for a ride, and hes comin to pay me friday.. so he says.. 
Strange how things work out..."

"event","i have neglected my live journal... 
man i am so conflicted. I want to go to the tom petty concert next week but i feel guilty spending $150 on tickets when i can sit outside the concert for free. No one will ever understand how much i love tom petty, without him i wouldnt have learned the guitar, or started Murr, or wrote songs, he made me the psycho music lover that i am. I love tom petty! his music makes me feel sooooooo good, oo how i love him. But the concert is also the day b4 my sisters b4 which i wont be around for because of my forensic psych final is the day after.. GRR should i just like setup camp outside the concert and listen to everything at the beach, maybe that will be more meaningful? Drag some good friends with me to chill outside, maybe pick up a crave case of white castle on the way and sit out there and listen to the wonderful work of tom petty and the heartbreakers? he will influence me to write 0132840218532 more songs i am sure, hes so good! 
ok enough about tom petty

Life is weird right now, its summer, i love summer, i havent gone dsurfing yet, which hopefully i will get to do on thrus. I havee to sell my 86 trans am so i can work on my 79 camaro, anyone interested? 
i have to clean my room now, unpack, go potty and play the drums now so i can go to the marina and work. 
latah skatahs..

She was sitting there, not moving, as if she were a cold marble statue resting in the winter breeze. The pale moonlight shadow drenched her delicate flesh and the devil's tune plays low and mournful as it creeps through the bitter storm. No one passes through the cracked streets. No sound enters except winter's children. A soft sigh leaves the girl and ventures to the cold air. 
Across from her sits a stranger. An unknown creature to her world. He hides in the shadows and plays the women for slaves. He watches the girl breath in and then slowy out as the the clock tower chimes midnight's bell. He stares at her with desire in his dark black eyes.
She had vague dreams sometimes, nightmares, when the darkness would take her and her soul would be ripped away. Seraphs would surround her, crying, and lay infront of her, two shadowed bodies. It seemed so real. 
She didn't know what she was anymore, after the dreams began; but she knew she had a strange and gentle understanding with the wolves of blair forest."

I have traveled amongst my kin and not one
as understood the pain that I experience. 
My love for you is strong and it may grow 
stronger and strengthen' over the years for 
I cannot forget you, my phantom of delight. 
Your death yearns me, teasing as I walk in a 
dream, to do the same, for I'd do anything to kiss those sacred lips. 

My flower, you may wither in a grave but you shall ring and I will listen, letting you lure me to my defeat. I cannot meet ends and find the dusty path that I once took. You were my shining light, my heavenly sun and now my world is dark. I am desperate for one last touch against your soft moon drenched skin. Or one small look at your virgin body, angelic in every way. No woman could be as gentle and fierce as you. 
I begged the Gods and Goddesses to let your soul live through your body for a moments rest. But all I have is memories, telling me I have nothing of you but your name and dieing love. I screamed at the heavens and the mountains. I blamed myself for I was weak, weakness that you proved I could have. But you taught me I have a heart, a heart to care and to love someone so deep I would give my soul to devil to breath life back into you. 

I miss you, my dear Calliope. My life is worthless compared to your love and they took you away, knowing that I would suffer for eternally. I want you; I need you to be with me for I am alone once again in our dark dome, my elite castle. Come back to me, I crawl on my hands and knees and beg for you to come back, my love. 
I have no more to write for my despair is too great for words and paper. I will wait for you to lure me to my death. I will search for you until you come back to me, bounded in blood and in heart.

Loving you always and forever,
Siete"

My routine is a regular exercise to kill me. Murder me while I obey every command. My boss beckons people to his office and then yells at them. You can here him yelling and see his chubby flabbering face blow up like a hot air balloon. Not good for his health. He'll die of a heart attack.

I wish I could die soon, sometimes. It would be comfortable just wondering around. I'm not exactly sure if I believe in a heaven or another life or just being dead. I can't stand anything like that. Once death is takes over my body my soul rather wonder the bottomless pit of a green forest then clouds or fire or anything of such things. I might die soon and I might not. Either way, very soon, I plan to get away from everything and just take my comp to be my only connection to this world. I like the idea of that much more than I like working or resting.

Well, so long. I have a letter to write for a story. I might test it here.

"event","Dead. Once again, I lay here dying of mistreatment and the eternal life leaving the early home it lived in for so many years. My hollow heart tangos with the shrill and withering breeze. Death follows my movements and traces my sins as I fall farther into a forever blistering community of demons and fire. I live for the torcher that the Gods and Goddesses give to us mortal humans. I live for the passionate love that will cut my heart and let it pour out all the blood that has flowed through my ice warm veins. I live for the harmony and promises that will reek of shriveled bodies lying on the streets. 
But as I lay here in the deathbed that was chosen for me, liquid ice driving me deeper into the depths of the unliving. I listen to my heartbeat, fading...one last thump and the flicker of life and hope gives out. Dark surrounds me, there is no way out. Nothing. Emptiness. Just a meaningless space.

"event","An hour till the funeral. No doubt that everyone will be falling asleep. If my cousin was watching this, he'd be sleeping on the pew, tossing and turning. 
I tried to suffocate myself last night by sleeping with the winter blankets on top of me. It didn't work, I also prayed for a tornado to strike. That didn't happen either. Nothing exciting really. Just the clock beeping all last night. It drives the family bonkers. Ah, wish they would leave, my apartment is a mess and I get to clean it up. Nothing like Cinderella though. No prince and people, just very bitchy family members. 
I dont think I'm a damsel in distress either. I hate dresses, well, I hate cloths period. But that's a different topic to discuss. I'll talk about that Tuesday. 
Therapy, I have that all this week Sat-Mon. All we do is talk about my issues, can't I talk about other people's issues? I swear I may have a slight tendacy(SP)(too lazy to think of spelling) to choke the dude(He's old and bald and grey) Stinky old man. Heh. He says I have issues, well, I told him I'm in complete denial. He says I admit that I have issues though I dont like to hear them. He just doesn't understand that this world is crazy, not I. But what ever gets is buzz a'going is fine by me. 
Computer Guidelines...my friends are putting computer guidelines on my computer! I call that injustice! I want justice! I'm suing! I need money, now fork it over! 
Yes, I'm insane if you didn't know it but isn't everyone? Some just hide in their basement and do it. I swear my the blood on my thumb, hangnail, that I don't care what others think and I will stick with my ""rebel"" attitude!!
I hope someone finds my insanity hopeless, ridikuless, and far fetch from my truth of being...forget I said that, just raise your opinions for further talk and I'll chat...scream though the night. (That's quite awhile off)(It's 11:22)(My clock is fast my 15 min)
My grandmother is calling for me to make brunch and get ready for church and stuff. My brain throbs at their voices but family is family, I guess.
Later,
Etta"

"event","Well, the funeral is tomorrow and I have a feeling all will not go well. My head still throbbing and the light hurts my eyes. No, I am not a vampire and I do not have a hangover. All family is here and I'm setting up my death bed. 
More to come, though. Cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, parents, siblings, etc. Everyone...a family gathering. I'm depressed, tired, and annoyed. How to fix it? Many solutions to that question but I'll leave the answer for later. No good books yet, still have yet to go shopping and organize my apartment. It's raining and I think I may just fall asleep. But then all the racket; my walls aren't sound proof.

Reading comics and throwing popcorn in the hall is nice; my family says they are gonna lock me up...what's new?! Thinking of things to write about or draw or scream about. Either of these work for me. Maybe I'll be heard if I yell. Maybe not.

My room is boiling. Feels like I'm surrounded by magma. I wish I could scream but then the neighbors would call the cops on child abuse. They came two days ago, accusing me of hitting my mother cause she was crying. She has problems, too. And they claim her innocent.

Well that's gonna be all until more pops up...

"event","Clasp
A screaming rage of hollow forest
Fallen Angels laugh with joyous
Never torn and never seen
Amongst those of devils green
Gleeful spirits of the night
Rumble till the morning light
Not till dawn do they flee
To hide the glorious little key
That seals their fate in unlock doors
Buried deep down within the core
A demons grasp is just a horn
But a devils clasp is something more
A shifting draft and a mingled shiver
Not much of a generous giver
Tears are cried by all who know
The treachery of the demons glow
They fight with pride and with heart
As those of greater evil part
Nothing left here or there
Just this small and feeble tale....

My head pounds at the sounds that enter at the ear. Voices screaming, begging for help that I cannot give. The ache in my heart will never heas as long as I hear their pleas. My heart shatters into shards of pain and tears for I pray for their hope to blossom into happiness and spread throughout their home. As smiles enter the days and death fazes over and will leave the crumbled world.
The clock chimes one and they come, stronger now, with force. My head throbs from the feirce blow. My heart weighted down with guilt. I scream as I slam down on my knees and pray--beg for the voices to stop, to leave me alone. Their problems are burdenskilling me every hour of the day. Not a moments rest. I'm desperate for sleep but all I can do is run. 
Bruises cover my body from the attempts I made to block all sounds. But by every minute they get stronger, more hungry for attention. I weep for I cannot take the world's mistakes, thier pain and suffering. I kneel at the edge of the cliff. A crack and rocks tumble down the dark pit. Deep and sharp. A perfect death...."

"event","Sean died yesterday afternoon and I just got the call some minutes ago. He was hit by a drunk driver while walking home at 11:00 pm from a friend's house. No news of who was driving the car yet. No news what so ever of anything except his death. He was my cousin and I miss him. It's not fair...

I'm gonna go now and think of some things..."

"event","Raska,>I am so happy and excited to meet you. I will try not to get my hopes up too much if I can, just in case you do not like me. I dont know why you wouldnt like me unless our age differnce bothers you? Anyways, I am glad to hear you are doing better lately. From the time I first starting writing to you a couple months ago, you have come a long way. You sound like you are getting your life on track again and I am happy for you. I really want you to meet my son Dylan who is almost 2 when we meet at the park, but if I take him I have to follow him everywhere and then we wont be able to talk much together. I am undecided at this point until I get to know you more. What do you think? Right now I have him on monday, wed, friday's from 8-12:30 p.m. and then tues, and thurs it is from 3-8:30 p.m. Sat, sun, for now I do not have him.
Although, today I went to court because I am seeking sole custody of him and it is possible I will get temporary sole custody now until a custody study is done to determine permanent custody. What a headache, but it will be worth it. I love him so much. He is my breath of air every day. He is just perfect! I am sure you feel that way about your little son and daughter too. It sounds like you are a great mother, I find that attractive, besides just appearance, and personality etc. I want to be with a loving person all around!
Well, I better go. I watched 50 first dates on dvd tonight, it gave me a sad feeling inside because I really want to fall in love just like in the movies sometimes. Anyhow, hope your day tomorrow is pleasant! Please write soon, I feel like a little child all excited inside thinking about meeting you.

"event","Ghosts of the past and moments ring 
of haunting memories, a shift from the last.
a wake from reality and a difficult sign 
to listen and to remind, no sound to clasp
the silent calls of morning bells laugh.
No words spoken around the town, 
evening or the night 
echoes whisper near the woods and 
mountians reach above the heavens and 
hold their proud peak high.
a deadly stench of flaming breath clouds the starry sky
a temptress dancing and mild tempers flare
Nothing to hold back....
a yawp of joy and a shreik of pain
Truths unleashed, lightning strikes the grounds
a crack in the earth and in the heart
no one's  home and home is no where

Somthing short and odd jsut for the people of Halo. 

Ooo, I want to get away from where I stand so badley. There is nothing here for me and I just hate being locked in a narrow-minded town. I think I may find a ride to Egypt or China, maybe Europe, or someplace like that. 

Argh...my brain is under pressure and I cant think of one book to read to the kids tonight. I looked all over my  shelves for something adventures...or something haunting. Nothing! I read all of my books to them all ready...*bout ready to scream* Oh brother Micheal.....

No ideas come to mind after thinking and thinking and thinking . Also searching, searching and searching. Nothing! Absolutley nothing. What am I going to do!?"

"event","Dear Rashka, I have a positive feeling that you are going to be very worth waiting for. You seem so sincere and a person of good charateristics for which I am looking for. I can wait until July if that works best for you, just dont give up on me ok? If you would like to bring your children when we first meet that would be fine. I will leave it your option. If for some reason we dont decide to date after we meet, we can be friends and I would still welcome your children. They would probably really enjoy my 2 year old son. We can meet at Silver Lake Park, they have a giant playground for children if you are not aware of it. You can let me know when the best day and time works out. Sound ok?
In the meantime. I go to court this coming monday to seek sole custody of my son. He is my whole life right now. I feel good about things and know that I can provide better for him than his mother does. I have a huge home with a large fenced backyard. I have alot of room for him and it is a good neighborhood. We will see how it goes monday.
Do you have plans for July 4th? I was thinking about taking the boat out to Lake Pepin to watch the fireworks from the boat. My family has done it a few times in the past. It is alot of fun, and very beautiful as well. Do you have extended family in or near Rochester? You moved here two years ago right? Where did you live before here?
Well, I am very excited to receive your letter and am really looking forward to meeting you finally. I know you will be glad to meet me when you do, dont worry.
Please write soon. Talk to you later.

Darrin.

--My sister's future husband I hope...yey!"

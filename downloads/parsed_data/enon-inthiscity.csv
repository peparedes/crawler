such a long time i have been gone

it seemed like a year in that damn place.

a month in rehab.

before that, it was everyday...everyday something to blow my mind even more than the previous day.

now i'm out, and you know what?

i'm doing more heroin than ever
shooting it... feeling it run through my veins, its amazing.
i guess im kind of 'on the run' but whatever.

they've tried to tie me down.

have they no sense? i will NEVER fall into their stupid robotic cycle.
i am meeeeee"

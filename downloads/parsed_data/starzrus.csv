"event","ok first off.. i am not looking for sympathy and for people to reply to this b/c i know it is the truth and i know that you have all heard it from someone else already and you all probably feel the same about me right now.


but i am a bitch
i was thinking only of myself.
and i go through the phases where i think only of myself
b/c i am changing
and i find different people and things to do
and i dont mean to hurt anyone
and it brings me to tears for what i did b/c i hate hurting people
and i genuinely dont mean to
but i do have a bad tendency and i recognize it
but i'm going through some of my  changes and i cant  change everything and i know i still act like a 5th grader in some aspects about this and i just wish i wasnt so self centered at times

and i dont mean to
i just feel like i'm doing everything wrong and nothing right

b/c i dont think.. i just do
and i think only about my happiness and not tohers
and i just wish i was as sweet as some of the people i know
and thought 

i would do anything to take it back. and now is when i am desperate for that time machine

i just dont know what has come over these past couple of weeks
i really need someone to help me and i am looking everywhere so i go off to places and just try to find someone to help me and raise my self esteem b/c it is really low right now and i have no idea why. and everything is going wrong and i am trying to stay my usual self and its so hard. i am loosing track of all the things i once beleived in and starting to forget my own morals. i feel like i'm headed in a downward spiral.i just want to grow up and be able to be mature about situations.i'm just afraid my time is running out.. i'm afraid these next years will go by in such a hurry that i wont realize what the fuck is going on andf th next thing youll know ill end up a loser on the streets. and i dont want that to happen. i'm afraid of my future.. and i know this is so weird but i want to die before i get out in the real world b/c i believe i wont be able to take care of myself and i will end up one of those stay at homes moms that takes care fo the children but i want to do something and be someone i've lost my passion and i dont know where to find it and i'm so scared. i'm so scared i'm losing who i once was. i want to be innocent again.i want to not know anything i wangt to start over.and do and try my best.and i hate myself so much right now i feel like a bitch.. i have never felt so horrible. i just want to shrivle up and die. 


none rant part.
[and the sad thing is all the people i know are probably really dissappointed and angry with me andthis is were i apoligize to them b/c i didnt mean to i didnt realize how much it effected people b/c it really doesnt effect me all that much and i was assuming everyone was me the reason i am not going to you one at time is b/c i dont know everyone who knows. all i can ask of you is to tell me when this is happening and warn me about it b/c i really do wanna change it. and i need to start realizing that i do affect other people and i do hurt other people and i need to stop being cruel. i hope all of the people i have offended without realizing it can realize  am being sincere and didint mean to offend them and that they have ti in their hearts to forgive and understand]"

to see how much he can make me cry.

he digs and won't shut up. and maybe i'm just being over emotional but god it hurts.. everything. i care. but people dont understand that.

otherwise..
i had an awesome night

today was emotional.
there was so much to remeber and i am already forgetting.

life is just kinda a whirl right now.
i'm not really sure what i'm doing but i know exactly what i'm feeling.
i dunno just the premise.

i need support.. that i can trust..
and i know i have so much around me and i am surrounded by it everyday
and i talked to someone today about it a little.
and i like that i like confiding in them.
but i want someone else.. someone that i dont have right now
and want dearly.

summer review
i had fun. it had it's boring times but right round the end of it it started to become interesting.. i got busy seeing all my theatre peeps and leah.. i hooked up with scott. new jersey and mississippi were great even though they had their moments like all things. and i got excited for school to start.. academics and all.. i just want the feeling of walking into that building again.. for some reason it gives off such a great feeling but you don't realize it anymore by the time you need to remember it to keep you going. but atleast i want to go back to school.. not like johnston where i dreaded every bit of it.

i just want to leave. get away from all the fucking bitches.

it's not like any of them really care.

i just want to be taken in by them but obviously none of them cept my dad care. all the rest would just throw me out on the curb.. even mo. she prooved that to me at the beginning.. and so would katie.. which hurts the most. which makes me write this and makes me cry.

even though she doesnt know. but i can't tell her.. it's not like she would understand. it's not like i've gone and left her alone with my family. she's a bitch. i fucking hate her.

and i know im just repeating but i can't help it. i feel such a circular feeling of emotion. 

she drives me fucking insane with her little teenage angst that she pulls on me. shit that she drives out of proportion. and i'm not saying i don't but i get over it. unlike her, she has to make things carry on fot fucking ever. GOD. the bitch."

i have been distyurbed lately about hwere im headed emotionally.. about how my friends will react to my carelessness.. aboyut how i am creless and tend to think more about myself then anyone else.

about how i feel alone and like no one is here

about how i feel people really dont wanna talk to me they are just putting up with me and think i am an annoying bitch

...i feel like i am slipping back into 5th grade when iknew all these things were true

and i hate it even more that i dont know if they are true or not. and i hate the fact that some people thiunk none of this but i am convinced i have completely left their lives and the figure me unworthy

im tired
worn out
angry
jealous
scared
trying not to be abvious
sorry

..but none of these are happy

why am i not happy.. ?

biggest question i cant find answer too and that makes me feel even worse

im afraid im slipping back into hopes.. instead of where i was in reality.. but then the parts of me that were in hope that i wanted it that way are going back to reality.

thats why i hate summer

people have time to think abnd actually feel emotion and worries and shit

fuck
fuck fuck fuck


the word of the day
fuck

..abnd worst of all.. im afraid i let down the peron i truely love that i would do anything for.. all b/c.. i simply forgot.. isnt that one of the most sorriest things in the world
to forgot one of the mpst important days
and now i can even talk..
im to scared
scared i wil never be forgivem
when i remembered i cried b/c of that fear
and its haunting me

then we went to the galleria for awhile me leah and abby. it was great i got a blondie shirt and lynard sknyrd shirt to go along with my pink floyd which i adore.. even though sometimes i wish i had a wall one.. which i must get.
then leah came back over and we watched the emperors new groove and then she left

i spent the rest of the day pretty much dowloading music.. cept i went out and bought some fabric for a dress and skirt im ganna make..i have been enjoying myself SOO much. i havent even had time to go swimming.well except for when i went with leah and her friends but that was at her friends house.. hopefully i will sunday b/c tomorrow i have to go around town and then a baseball game and then erikas party and then leahs house.. so when  my mommie picks me up ill hopefully be able to swim.

I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh aloud so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world is so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
No
No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

I don't wanna hear you say
That I will understand someday
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna hear you say
You both have grown in a different way
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna meet your friends
And I don't wanna start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Some days I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now...

I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now"

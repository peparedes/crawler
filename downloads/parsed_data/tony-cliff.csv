I&rsquo;m just about done colouring chapter one of DDATOL, and I discovered a neat time-saving trick.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve been using the gradient tool to quickly throw down colours in abstract backgrounds. That&rsquo;s what you see above. It works well &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to experiment with and is fast. But I don&rsquo;t like how smooth it looks. I&rsquo;ve been fighting this in the past by using a textured brush to go in, sample a colour, paint, sample again, paint, sample, paint, etc. you get the idea. It takes longer than I&rsquo;d like, and it sometimes muddies the colours.

This is basically the look I would have been trying to get by sampling and re-painting the BG, except I wouldn&rsquo;t have had as much flexibility.

"event","<img alt="""" src=""http://www.tonycliff.com/images/cowboy1.gif"" /><br /><br />A few days ago I came to the end credits of Red Dead Redemption, and since I know a few of you LJ friends are also spending some time with the game, I thought I might share some of my impressions and see what you guys thought of it /slash/ are thinking of it.<br /><br />I loved the game, partly because I love the environment and the setting, partly because I love the Old West atmosphere, and partly because I really enjoy Rockstar's brand of open-world gaming and their excellent presentation. After finishing the game, I felt the same way I feel when I finish a particularly good novel - I am disappointed that I&nbsp;won't be able to spend any more time with those characters. The difference being that in this novel, someone forgot to edit out all the pages of landscape description and endless travel.<br /><br />I&nbsp;outline some praise below, but mostly gripes. Like many other things, if it were crap, I wouldn't bother to gripe with it. But when I enjoy something so much, it's easy to find the imperfections. Sounds bitchy, but hey, what can you do?<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""AN UNTAMED WILDERNESS OF SPOILERS..."">- One review I read or listened to mentioned that the game simply drops characters from the story once they have no more missions to provide, and this proved to be my biggest frustration with the game. The first time this is apparent is after saving Bonnie from the hanging. She and her father disappear from the story completely. Thankfully, they do the smart thing and bring her back in one mission at the very end of the game, and they do a decent job of playing up the character business between bonnie and Marston's wife (who, incidentally, comes across no where near as appealing as Bonnie). <br />None of the other characters are as lucky, though - as soon as a character's bank of missions is exhausted, they're removed from the game world. This is disappointing because, while the scenery is gorgeous and the world is very well realized, the characters add the real interest and the colour to the setting.<br />While riding around the countryside, occasionally you'll discover a group of folks camped around a fire. You have the option to join them, and all you do is listen to a story they have to tell. When you feel like leaving, you can leave. It's a shame that the developers didn't decide to include a similar functionality with &quot;expired&quot; story characters. For example, maybe Landon Ricketts doesn't have any new missions for me, but I might be able to find him sitting around at the poker tables in town. Press a button, and maybe Marston and he sit together, and Landon talks about business that happened to him, or maybe goes on about what he's heard about Marston doing. Maybe you encounter the snake oil salesman at random points, and HE asks you to do the silly flower-gathering tasks. <br />The worst incident, however, is how casually Luisa is dismissed. She is killed, and her death is treated with not much more importance than the thousands of other dudes who'll die during the meat of the game. This is a girl who Marston helped to rescue, but he barely seems to notice when she dies.<br /><br />- For such a bad-ass frontier killer, Marston seems to be a real sucker. He allows himself to be turned into an errand boy for every person he encounters, and almost all of the action in the game is a undertaken at the request of some stranger. It would have been nice for Marston to have some sort of self-direction, or some sort of free will or independant thought. I don't know how that would be communicated to the player, but it felt very necessary. In Zelda, you have the dopey little flying fairy that tells you what to do all the time. Here, perhaps it could be some sort of internal monologue. Best case scenario would be an internal monologue with options, where Marston thinks about potential approaches to a problem, and you get to enact one or more of them.<br />I think there might be a bit of dialogue in Marston's exchanges with Dutch that acknowledge this errand-boy business, but it's not enough. I've spent x number of hours playing this game, a verbal wink is not enough to validate that.<br /><br />- I loved a lot of the characters, but there were many times when a character just seemed to be a vehicle for expressing a caricature of some sort of ideology. Is that what &quot;heavy-handed&quot; writing is? I would have preferred better characters and fewer caricatures.<br /><br />- Let's have player characters in video games not talk anymore. Sure, it's easier. But that's the only benefit I can see. Too often, the player character says something that couldn't be more at odds with what I, The Player, am thinking. And it ruins things. Maybe it presents narrative problems, like &quot;how do we communicate what Marston's business is here&quot;, but that's a problem that's solveable.<br /><br />- More video games need to have endings like this. No retarded million-hit-point boss battles, just a really, really satisfying narrative conclusion. There are details about it that bumped me or that I didn't like, but overall the feel and the pacing of the last 20% of the game is excellent. I absolutely loved the business about teaching Marston's son in a manner similar to how NPCs had been teaching you, the player, at the start of the game. The whole of that Beecher's Hope chunk of the game was great. We get to see Bonnie again, which also ties in nicely with the start of the game. I would have liked to see some of the other characters again, and I would have liked some cross-country missions in the last third of the game, but other than that the feel of the last little stretch was excellent. Plus, the way Marston's last stand is treated was appropriately dramatic and exciting (I tried the mission over at least three times to see if there was some way to escape the inevitable, but I guess not).<br />Once you become Jack, I enjoyed the cross-country hunt for Ross, but I would have preferred encountering some of the other NPCs again. I also would have enjoyed a much more brutal end for Ross.<br /><br />- The sky and weather effects are just the best. I got lucky, and during that very final Ross-hunting mission, not only was the game raining and thundering and lightninging, but the weather outside, here in Vancouver, BC, was doing the exact same thing. Hailing, pouring rain, wind blowing like crazy, and loads of thunder. How's that for versimilitude?<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""HTTP://www.tonycliff.com/images/skydeer1.jpg"" /> </lj-cut><br /><br />"

Actually, my PC isn&#39;t performing any worse than it used to, but I&#39;ve tried some of the new ones, and they sure are snappy. If computing power had plateaued around the time I built this PC I&#39;m writing this on, I&#39;d have nothing to complain about. But that&#39;s not the case. It&#39;s like if people didn&#39;t necessarily get more stooped-over and wrinkly as they aged, but new 25-year-olds were getting comparatively much more attractive with each year that new 25-year-olds came off the line. But they&#39;re all either too tall or too short.<p /> I&#39;m getting tired of Windows XP, too. For some reason, Photoshop CS4 was unable to fully take advantage of my graphic card, so those GPU-dependant features didn&#39;t work. Turns out CS5 can&#39;t figure it out, either. I updated the graphic drivers, and you know what? I am getting really tired of updating graphic drivers.<p /> Additionally, last year I tried using some Mac-only writing software to not only participate in National Novel Writing Month, but to write four graphic-novel story treatments, and I must say that using a Mac for day-to-day productivity was a great experience -- much improved over Windows XP. I resolved myself that as soon as the Macbook Pros were refreshed (Apple gives them a spec bump every so often), I&#39;d pick one up. Except now that they&#39;re here, it&#39;s hard to get too excited.<p /> The Macbook Pros seem appealing - they take up little room, are attractive, and almost as powerful as I&#39;d like. I have no real need for the portability, though, so I&#39;d rather not pay a premium for that.<p /> The Mac Pros - well, they&#39;re just too expensive, and I would very rarely tax the machine&#39;s capabilities.<p />Looking at the specs, the 27&quot; i7 iMac would be the perfect machine. I&#39;d love one. Except it&#39;s <i>enormous </i>and <i>I do not need another monitor</i>. For about eight hundred dollars less, I could build an identical Windows machine. For $900 less, Dell will build me one, with a useful 12GB of RAM. Apple, why can&#39;t you offer me a headless iMac? It seems like a shame that I should be spending two- to three-thousand dollars and not getting something just right.<p /> (I have another gripe against Apple that makes me wary to buy into their club - they seem to be adopting the great Evil Software Corporation reputation that Microsoft used to have. It&#39;s like I&#39;ve fallen through the nerdy rabbit hole. I&#39;d expound on this topic, but there are tech pundits doing a better job of that <i>right now</i>, somewhere, I&#39;m sure.)<p /> <br />MEANWHILE, IN LOS ANGELES...<p />I never thought I&#39;d say this, but I&#39;ve been having many fond thoughts of L.A. lately. There seem to be a lot of great comedy things and a lot of great art things going on down there these days. I know for a fact that there are some cool people down there. I get the impression that the general populace is nicer than here in Vancouver, too.<br /> Also? It&#39;s a real, actual, major city. Vancouver thinks it&#39;s a major city -- certainly the real estate is priced that way -- but has none of the <i>actual </i>cultural amenities that a real major city has.<br />And I love Vancouver - it&#39;s very, very pretty, there are sidewalks, the air is relatively clean and sushi restaurants and bike paths are both plentiful.<br /> You know what? The truth is I just really want to see <a href=""http://thrillingadventurehour.com/"">this show</a>, and I want to live somewhere where a show like that happens.      <p style=""font-size: 10px;"">  <a href=""http://posterous.com"">Posted via email</a>   from <a href=""http://tonycliff.posterous.com/computer-woes-delightful-cities"">1, 2, 3, 4, Journal</a>  </p>  </div>"

It started out with Option 4 taking a pretty strong lead. Option 1 was sort of like a tag-along - it seems like people who liked 1 also liked 4, and 4 gained the most weight. But then Option 3 started to pick up steam late in the day! <p /> Unfortunately for 3, if you put it in context (the same context I so cruelly refused to provide), it doesn't work as well as 1 or 4. So I've tightened up 4 a bit (you can see that above) and printed it off (you can see that below). This page comes between 19 and 20 in Chapter 4, so I'll be pencilling it in about two weeks.

I thought for this one, I might try a limited-palette, solid-colour approach, similar to <a href=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2786/4341003547_15b82589bd_o.jpg"">this image</a> (read the whole article on the artist <a href=""http://todaysinspiration.blogspot.com/2010/02/angel-badia-camps.html"">here</a>, at Leif Peng's wonderful <a href=""http://todaysinspiration.blogspot.com/""><em>Today's Inspiration</em></a> site). I couldn't get it to work, though, since I hadn't started the drawing with that colouring style in mind. As a result, I didn't design the image with enough big, solid, shapes or with the big contrasty hits of black. On images like this, I have usually failed to think in terms of colour, focusing instead on the shapes, the linework, and describing the things that I am trying to make an image of. That carries over to the colouring so that instead of really visualizing the image as a colour composition, I end up basically colouring within the lines, like a fancy colouring book. It becomes a technical exercise, where the new challenge is giving everything a colour and value that will approximately balance the composition now that it's in colour and not just black and white lines. I would like to be thinking, &quot;how can I use colour in this image to create the composition&quot; rather than, &quot;well, her boots are brown cause her boots are supposed to be brown, so how do I either mute their colour or compensate elsewhere so they don't stick out&quot;. I need to be using the colour purposefully and confidently, rather than as an &quot;add-on&quot; or a technicality. So I'm going to have to start thinking ahead.</p><p>That said, I enjoy the way images like this turn out, but the process is still too fiddly and technical-feeling.</p>"

It is enormous. Spent the morning hooking it up, figuring it out, and I think I've finally arrived at some decent results for printing out enlargements of my rough pages.<br />The roughs are tightened in Photoshop in greyscale, then I change 'em to CMYK and add a Gradient Map adjustment layer to the top of the layer stack. The gradient is 30% cyan on one end, white on the other. I I send it to the printer, letting Photoshop manage the colours. Feed some Strathmore Bristol into the front-load slot on the printer, click, press, whirr, and hey - I have an 11x17 blue printout of my rough page, ready to clean.<br />When they're scanned back in in RGB, removing the blue channel does a very acceptable job of sucking the rough out of the page. Yay.<br />Gonna spend tomorrow printing out the rest of Chapter 2, then I'll finally get to peel myself away from this computer for some <i>real </i>drawing. Tightening the roughs has taken roughly two months, and I'm tired of this desk and this chair.<br /> Anyone want to make a wager as to how many pages I can get through before the blue print cartridges expire?<br /> <p><img width=""500"" height=""667"" src=""http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/tonycliff/enOObz2qdiibQ6RRDhV6x4C5FaIxuW400acIW7EC6NPmUss7ugR1sPmQ0KNH/printing_02.jpg"" alt="""" />&nbsp;<br />^ ENORMOUS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      <p style=""font-size: 10px;""><a href=""http://posterous.com"">Posted via email</a>   from <a href=""http://tonycliff.posterous.com/onward-to-victory-printing"">1, 2, 3, 4, Journal</a></p></div>"

Then it's time to print 'em out and clean up the artwork. I'm going to be trying a method that seems to be working for our friend <a href=""http://www.boltcity.com"">Kazu</a>. You start with small thumbnails (four pages per 8.5x11&quot; sheet), scan 'em in, blow 'em up, and clean up over that. My thumbs aren't as clean as Kazu's, so I've been<a href=""http://www.tonycliff.com/blog/2009/12/18/whoops/""> tidying them up</a> in Photoshop so that they're legible to strangers (to get a better idea early on of how the book will read). I'll probably do a writeup on the process later on, assuming it doesn't completely fail for me.<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Internet Fiddling.</b> This post should be on Livejournal thanks to Posterous's autoposting features. Theoretically, I email posterous, it posts the post there and simultaneously posts it to my Livejournal and my Twitter feed. Neat concept - I like the &quot;connected-ness&quot; of Posterous, and the autoposting to Livejournal means I don't have to abandon one format to embrace another. It's like if Microsoft had included email forwarding in Hotmail, I wouldn't have to go back every now and then to make sure no one's trying to reach me through an address I haven't used in years since embracing Gmail.<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Google is Terrifying. </b>Does anyone else worry about the ubiquity of Google? I just installed Google Analytics on my site. I use Gmail (and so technically, it's scanning all my communication as it looks for words to base the advertising off). I use a bunch of other Google stuff. They own Youtube. I'm sure there are other, more well-informed explorations of this issue, but what if Google went evil one day? I'm a bit scared.<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Flickr.</b> At least the internet's favorite image host is owned by Yahoo. Sure, Google has Picasa, but it feels like Flickr has more people under its umbrella. Anyway, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonycliff/"">I filled out an account</a>. You can check it out if you like, there's some drawings and stuff there. Frustrating that I had to sign up for some stupid Yahoo ID to use it. Since it remembers who I am, I'll only very rarely have to remember that stupid ID to log in, which means that I'll forget it every effing time. :P<p>&nbsp;</p> I should be wasting less time on the internet, more time making comics.      <br /><strong><br />LIVEJOURNAL&nbsp;UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp;Wow, Posterous did a really good job. The only problem is that they took that image, which was hosted on my tonycliff.com site, and carted it over to Posterous's servers. This could be good or bad, but the downside is that I wonder what happens when Posterous decides it wants to charge for holding my images and so on and so forth.<br />Oh, and here's the <a href=""http://tonycliff.posterous.com/"">Posterous blog</a>.<p style=""font-size: 10px;""><a href=""http://posterous.com"">Posted via email</a>   from <a href=""http://tonycliff.posterous.com/delilah-update-some-internet-rambling"">1, 2, 3, 4, Journal</a><br /><br />&nbsp;</p></div>"

Perhaps you&rsquo;ve been wondering what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the last few months. While the former is probably more likely, I&rsquo;m happy to present some news which will satisfy both options.</p> <p>There will be a Delilah Dirk graphic novel. I&rsquo;ve been referring to it as &ldquo;The Oriental Lieutenant&rdquo;, which is a title that may or may not stick. On the one hand, from a 19th century Western perspective, &ldquo;The Orient&rdquo; included Turkey. On the other hand, current popular understanding makes &ldquo;The Orient&rdquo; out to be China, Thailand, etc. On the mystical and unexpected <em>third </em>hand, it could stand to be a more exciting title. So, for the time being, it will be <em>Book One </em>until I come up with something better.</p> <p>&ldquo;That implies that there will be more than one book, &rdquo; I hear you scream through the Inter-Nets. Your screams ring true! I intend to make a few DD graphic novels. Last October, I spent the month writing story treatments for a handful of different projects, two of which were Delilah Dirk stories. Since then I have roughed out the first book, as in the image above. That&rsquo;s a montage of all the pages of <em>rough </em>roughs for Book One. Yesterday I finished cleaning them up into working roughs, from which I&rsquo;ll complete the clean artwork.</p> <p>Maybe you think that seems like a long time to rough out a book. You&rsquo;d be wrong if you didn&rsquo;t know that about a third of the book is completed material. Book One will include <a href=""http://www.tonycliff.com/blog/projects/the-treasure-of-constantinople/""><em>Delilah Dirk and the Treasure of Constantinople</em></a> as Chapter One, and <a href=""http://www.tonycliff.com/blog/projects/the-aqueduct/""><em>Delilah Dirk and the Aqueduct</em></a> as Chapter Three. Those are respectively the single-issue story I published through Lulu.com and my DD Flight story. There will be a new chapter between them and a new chapter after <em>Aqueduct</em>. If you are mathematically inclined, you will notice the incongruity between adding two chapters to a total of four and having completed one third of the book already. Well, the new chapters are longer!</p> <p>Next steps! I had roughed out two versions of Chapter 4, and while tightening the first version (which I thought was better), I&rsquo;ve realized that the second is, in fact, the better one. So I&rsquo;ll be tightening that. After that, I can move on to linework. Meanwhile, I get to figure out how to get this thing published. Exciting times! More news as it happens!</p>ALSO:&nbsp;Man, a good day for Books People are Working On: Have you guys seen <lj user=""monstro_draw""/>&nbsp;'s bitchin'<a href=""http://monstro-draw.livejournal.com/15310.html""><em>Zombie Chasers</em> announcement</a>?"

"event","Question:

This sentence: &quot;You were abusing the mailman again, weren't you?&quot;

When it's an accusation, as opposed to an actual question, can I&nbsp;drop the question mark? Cause he's not asking, &quot;were you abusing the mailman?&quot;, he's saying, &quot;I know you were abusing the mailman and I am confronting you with that fact&quot;. I would like to write: &quot;...mailman again, weren't you.&quot;&nbsp; ... except that looks weird. But I am definitely wanting you to NOT&nbsp;read that with the question-inflection at the end.

TELL&nbsp;ME, FRIENDS!"

It is 2010 &ndash; the official start of The Future. Each year I&rsquo;ve been more and more disappointed at the refusal of flying cars to allow themselves to be invented. However, if you had told me ten years ago that I would have a little calculator-sized device on which I could store my whole music collection and check my e-mail (what&rsquo;s an &ldquo;e-mail&rdquo;?) and even watch moving video images beamed telemagically into my device on invisible waves, I would have laughed you into a puddle. Same goes for if you had told me that I would prefer to spend my time reading through a column of 140-character ramblings of friends and celebrities over watching a television programme.&nbsp; I had become so preoccupied waiting for the future I thought would arrive that I hardly noticed how much things had changed. And that&rsquo;s just my iPod Touch &ndash; nevermind all the other crazy things that have happened (for example, people stopped saying &ldquo;hella&rdquo; and &ldquo;rad&rdquo;).</p> <p>So maybe this year will be the year I stop waiting for the flying car. I&rsquo;m going to get a new kitchen faucet and sink, I&rsquo;m going to renovate the bathroom, and I&rsquo;m going to finish a graphic novel (more on that later, I promise). I&rsquo;m excited to find out what this purported Apple tablet might mean for comic books (it could be an awesome medium). I&rsquo;m going to try to play video games a little less, and I will probably fail. But at least I won&rsquo;t be waiting for the flying car.</p> <p>To you who&rsquo;s reading this &ndash; happy New Year to you, and I hope it is a good year with many successes, free from trouble, strife, and sickness. I will endeavour to provide more compelling content here, and when I fail at <em>that</em>, I will at least provide <em>more </em>content. If you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll be a part of your 2010, and you&rsquo;ll be a part of mine, and it&rsquo;ll be hella rad.</p>"

I went to the library yesterday and took <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.cliff/PicturesqueSketchesInSpain?feat=directlink"">a bunch of photos</a> from David Roberts' <em>Picturesque Sketches in Spain</em>. Unlike <em>Beauties of the Bosphorus</em>, there's no substantial text to go with this one - it's just twenty-six drawings. Twenty-six <em>enormous </em>drawings. See <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/z1cefmDAUb5nJMUxyW4BEQ?feat=directlink"">this photo</a> for a size comparison. It sure made them a lot easier to photograph, though these photos still barely do justice to the images, which for some reason I'm sure you could never photograph sufficiently - they lose so much fidelity. It's so easy to get a sense of the hand and the feel of the drawing with the actual prints, and those feelings don't come across in the photos. So if you have a library near you, check to see if they have a copy, and take a look in-person.<br /><br />These prints were made using lithographic techniques. If it's anything like the lithography courses I took back in college, it involves drawing with a greasy pencil on a stone slab. The ink then sticks to the greasy bits.&nbsp; It looks like there's a &quot;medium ground&quot;&nbsp;beige layer that's put down, which is subtracted from to create the white &quot;highlights&quot; by revealing the paper beneath. The black drawing is then laid overtop. There are a few <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8sLt5gBta5lI5lKXPhhk3g?feat=directlink"">&quot;texture&quot;&nbsp;photos</a> near the end of the album where I've done my best to reveal the <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7m3mOx8ODTN7rfllzz4JdA?feat=directlink"">texture of the paper and the printing</a>.<br /><br />I love, love, <em>love </em>Roberts' drawing style. Something about his draughtsmanship is really lovely - it's kind of impressionistic, maybe? but still really descriptive. If I understand the process correctly, the prints in the book were actually drawn on the litho stone by an artist other than Roberts. (These artists are listed in the contents page.) There is one image that is actually drawn to stone by Roberts himself (<a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sc23ndbo0qXqFlTRQwO8iQ?feat=directlink"">this one</a>), and it's one of my two favorites (<a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/8fEsl8Cahfh6SfQs0iXASQ?feat=directlink"">this is the other</a>). There's a looseness in his rendering that is missing from the other drawings. In some, the figures seem &quot;poured&quot; into their shapes. Here, the figures seem much more confidently portrayed. <br /><br />There's a heavy emphasis on churchy architecture through the book, which is not really my bag, but you can't argue the dedication he's taken to representing the details.<br /><br />Another interesting point is his seemingly arbitrary use of value. In <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LR-CgmxGYzh9CHAZRWa0tg?feat=directlink"">this image</a>, we see the two crumbled remains of the bridge on the left in shadow, as well as the building in the background, on the right - it has a shadow slanting across it, too. The values are very helpful for making a more dynamic composition, though I'm not sure what could be casting the shadows. Very selective clouds, perhaps.&nbsp; It's interesting to see that, while the scenery's already pretty picturesque, the artist always carries the weight of the responsibility for these scenes being that way. <br /><br /><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.cliff/PicturesqueSketchesInSpain?feat=directlink"">Enjoy</a>!&nbsp;and if you have any questions, leave 'em in the comments.<br /><br />"

I went there today and took a look at &quot;Beauties of the Bosphorus&quot; , illustrated by W.H. Bartlett with description by Julia Pardoe. The nice librarian who wasn't even slightly nervous about handing me a two-hundred-year-old book asked me to place the book on a special pillow while I read it, to protect the spine. A&nbsp;little literary posturpedic.<br /><br />I took photos! Now, while I&nbsp;have a nice camera, it's not up to the task of reproducing the fine detail of the illustrations. The engraving is very, very fine. And I haven't taken pictures of every page of the book. Nevertheless, feel free to <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/tony.cliff/BeautiesOfTheBosphorus?feat=directlink"">go check out all the images</a>. You can download all of them in the same resolution I&nbsp;took them at. I haven't done any image processing on them either - no sharpening, no levels.<br /><br />If I had longer, I would have liked to copy out or somehow transcribe the text of the book, as it provides a lot of assistance for reading the images. In conjunction with the map at the back of the book, it helps to place the scenes relative to each other, and as you develop familiarity, you can see landmarks, geography, and motifs that repeat.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp;Also, I've taken photos of a few of the many times that the author quotes Byron. Man, she must have <em>loved </em>Byron.<br /><br />I'm hoping that I might be able to repeat the process with a camera and lenses better suited to the task. They have a camera room at the library, but you have to rent it out, and you still have to BYO camera.<br /><br />Anyway, if you enjoy the images, let me know! I hope they're useful for people the same way I would have found them useful two years ago.<br /><br />"

I discovered the Special Reference Collection at the Vancouver Public Library. They apparently have copies of The Holy Land (illustrated by David Roberts, printed in 1844) and Beauties of the Bosphorus (illustrated by William Henry Bartlett, printed in 1838). Any you know what?&nbsp;They let you just GO&nbsp;IN&nbsp;and LOOK&nbsp;AT&nbsp;THEM. I'm sure TOUCHING&nbsp;THEM&nbsp;is also part of the process, too. DAMN! You know what?&nbsp;They even let you take PHOTOS&nbsp;of them. Hi-res reference collection, HERE&nbsp;I&nbsp;COME!!!!<br /><br />Maybe you're thinking, &quot;so what?&quot; I'll tell you what. &quot;Beauties of the Bosphorus&quot; is what I used when I was doing &quot;Treasure of Constantinople&quot;&nbsp;for location reference, except I&nbsp;was using pretty low-res JPGs. I've since tried to purchase a legitimate antique copy, but that ess is expensive.<br /><br />I love David Roberts' work, also (pictured above) - his draftsmanship is spectacular. I love that early-1800s explorer-type draughstman style.<br /><br />AH&nbsp;did I&nbsp;mention that the books are ENORMOUS? It's a fact.<br /><br />Next step? Time to get my Library Hermit suit on. Guys, I&nbsp;am so pumped.<br /><br />UPDATE:&nbsp;OMIGOSHOMIGOSHOMIGOSHOMIGOSH, you guys, they also have Roberts' &quot;Picturesque Sketches in Spain&quot; guys i am so excited holy shit just bury me in the library for a month i'll see you later.<br /><br /><br />"

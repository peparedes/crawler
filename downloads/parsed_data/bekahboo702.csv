"event","Just to let y'all in on what i did last week for february vacation:
<lj-cut text=""It's kind of long, though...""</lj-cut text>

I went to Mobile, Alabama for a Habitat for Humanity project
The site we were working at wasn't directly hit by Katrina, but other parts of Mobile were and we also drove through Biluxi, which was kind of intense.

We flew to Atlanta and then drove from Atlanta to Mobile, which is about 5 hours and i went a little crazy.
We stayed in a former-convent where there were some Ameri-corp workers living. It was kind of creepy because there were crosses and crucified jesuses everywhere
<img src=""http://photos-744.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134744_3173.jpg"">
<img src=""http://photos-745.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134745_3528.jpg"">

Anyways, we got to experience a ""Family friendly"" mardi gras, which was kind of funny.
it was like a sea of 23 white kids all wearing the same bright blue t-shirt in a crowd of mostly black people.
And i am pretty sure i have never felt more white
for example:
<param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/1miULxdZ6-4""></param><param name=""wmode"" value=""transparent""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/1miULxdZ6-4"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" width=""425"" height=""350""></embed>

The DJ even said (on a mic so everyone could hear) ""Y'all probably never seen so many black people in one place"" and said to one of my friends
<b>""I'm sure your daddy drives a Benz and your girlfriend's name is Becky""</b>
<img src=""http://photos-790.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134790_9680.jpg"">

It was really awesome, though. and the cars in Alabama are all wicked tricked out. We saw some 26'' rims, and on the car it actually said <b>26''</b> right next to the front wheel.

<img src=""http://photos-748.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134748_4570.jpg"">
<img src=""http://photos-754.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134754_6640.jpg"">

the parade was even more amazing because we got to get beads.
<img src=""http://photos-780.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134780_6150.jpg"">
some of them were throwing frisbees and one of my friends caught one and hammered it back and actually decked the lady on top. She went DOWN and did NOT come back up.
<img src=""http://photos-760.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134760_8745.jpg"">
and this guy took the bead thing very seriously

Besides the amazingness of Mardi Gras, we actually did do work on houses.

<img src=""http://photos-844.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134844_4974.jpg"">

and we got to wear hard hats and look like we knew what we were doing

<img src=""http://photos-921.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134921_135.jpg"">

I also met someone named Peter Parker

<img src=""http://photos-920.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134920_9821.jpg"">

and obviously, there were some gorgeous construction worker men at the worksite that made the trip a little better
<img src=""http://photos-931.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134931_3220.jpg"">
<img src=""http://photos-933.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134933_3866.jpg"">
and this is Jesse, who lived in the former-convent with us, who was always stoned out of his mind, but that is why we loved him...
<img src=""http://photos-935.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134935_4491.jpg"">
that, and he had ""i don't care"" hair

One day it rained, so we couldn't go to the work site. We got to explore Mobile post-Mardi Gras (which was kind of gross). Normally, you'd think after a huge celebration there would be city workers cleaning everything up and by the next morning you would have no idea anything happened...well, not in Mobile.
We saw beads and trash evvverywhere. We went into the center of Mobile and there was a mesh of seafood and potatoes in a potted plant that smelled kind of rancid.
But it wasn't all bad, Mobile is actually kind of pretty.
We visited some old civil war forts which were kind of cool
<img src=""http://photos-809.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134809_2623.jpg"">
<img src=""http://photos-823.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134823_7028.jpg"">

and there was an ACTUAL blacksmith who showed how to make things
<img src=""http://photos-825.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134825_7698.jpg"">

but unfortunately
<img src=""http://photos-829.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134829_9568.jpg"">

We also visited an old airforce/naval base or something like that, but it was full of old people
<img src=""http://photos-796.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134796_6800.jpg"">

and kind of expensive so we just roamed around the planes on display and left to find somewhere to eat

<img src=""http://photos-801.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134801_8888.jpg"">
<img src=""http://photos-798.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134798_7649.jpg"">

We went on some crazy bridges on the way
<img src=""http://photos-805.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134805_800.jpg"">

and finally decided on Saucy Q's Bar BQ, where they served a dish called the ""Gimme 5"" which was basically a platter of every meat you could ever imagine
<img src=""http://photos-832.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134832_545.jpg"">

and yes, they did eat it all
<img src=""http://photos-835.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134835_1779.jpg"">
<img src=""http://photos-837.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134837_2563.jpg"">

And so friday after work we headed back to Atlanta (except with a 2 hour detour since we visited biluxi) and me and my friend John didn't sleep AT ALL because it was our job to keep our driver awake. It got kind of intense because we sang the WHOLE night and tried harmonizing to every song...one of our best was ""American pie"". At one point i commented that i had never stayed up this late without videogames so john suggested we pretend to play Wii Tennis. It was my serve and slammed my hand on the roof of the car, and for some reason it was very hilarious. But, we finally got to the Hilton Hotel in Atlanta and stayed there for about 3 hours until we had to go to the airport to catch our flight to Boston.
<img src=""http://photos-937.ak.facebook.com/ip002/v65/79/1/1242450147/n1242450147_30134937_5101.jpg"">

and when i got home i took a ""nap"" at around 2:00 PM and woke up this morning at 8:44 AM. Around 19 hours of sleep."

also, check out what <a href=""http://perezhilton.com/topics/daniel_radcliffe/harry_potter_does_beastly_kiddie_porn_20070130.php"">perezhilton.com</a> has to say.

btw the synopsis of the play:
Equus is a complicated play about a boy's messed up relationship with his parents, who are mildly abusive and give him all kinds of strange ideas about horses, religion and television. These pictures are appropriate for the play, the main character blinds six horses and has an erotic relationship with one horse."

<lj-cut text=""i have a funny story...""</lj-cut>

So there's this girl in my physics class who is REALLY fucking annoying. All she does is flirt with boys and thinks she's wicked hot shit. So anyways, a couple of weeks ago the class started talking about Harry Potter and i got really happy and she asked, ""Oh, when does the next movie come out?"" And after watching the trailer about 50 million times i said, ""Oh, i think it's July 13th"" and she goes, ""Um...yeah, actually i think it's the 11th""
Just the way she said it, i wanted to strangle her.
So to myself i said a little ""Fuck You"" and this kid heard me and started laughing.

But this was the same girl who last year in my spanish class blurted out who died in 6th book. The story goes that my friend sarah was in the middle of reading about it and she was like ""Oh, i'm really anxious to find out who dies"" and she just goes ""OH, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT (SO AND SO) DYING??"" and i was like ""YOU DON'T JUST SAY THAT."" She goes, ""what that (so and so) died?""
And i was ready to pounce on her...I said ""No, you fucking don't say that in public, it's like the unspoken rule. If you're going to say it, at least make sure everyone in the general vicinity has read it or doesn't care.""
and se was just like ""Sorry.""
I remember being in a bad mood the rest of the day.

PS. i actually was right about it being the 13th. Or at least that's what the trailer says.

fuck you, bitch."

so i got to go to the OOTP movie premiere, and they gave us all of these pieces of paper for the celebrities to sign (and for some reason, mary-kate and ashley were going to be there?) and it was just a piece of paper that said:
Character Name:________
Celebrity Name: _________
but anyways, i got there early, so i got all of the small people's autographs (luna lovegood's, and filch) and so i went home or something...this part of the dream is blurry...and then i came back again when the big stars were supposed to be there and i lost almost all of my papers, so i had to get them all on ONE piece of paper...so the phelps brothers come up (and for some reason, one of their names was ""Orange"" and the other one i just called George), and i got their autographs and then i saw daniel radcliffe and i started freaking out and ""Orange"" was like ""oh, you really like him, don't you? You can't even control yourself.."" and i just kept screaming and then eventually he came up and Orange was like ""Hey dan, this one fancies you!"" and dan was like ""you want my autograph?"" and i was like ""AHH! YESS!!"" and then he gave me a hug and then Orange goes, ""why don't you give her the special hogwarts greeting.."" and then <b>DANIEL RADCLIFFE TOUCHED MY BOOBS!!!!</b> no joke!!!! i don't know what got into my mind, but apparently that is the special hoigwarts welcome...well, anyways, he moved on down the carpet, and some more people came in...i was waiting to get emma watson's autograph (i totally forgot about rupert) but she was going to be really late so i just went in to see the movie...
it continues, nothing really that interesting..the movie was nothing like the book, and it had the old dumbledore in it...and it started out with this baby on a hovering flower looking over a giant mushroom (where i guess the Order was...i'm not sure)

my mind is SERIOUSLY fucked up...but if daniel radcliffe gets to touch my boobs, i'm all for it."

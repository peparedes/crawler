"event","K so.. this weekend was grad bash! it started out pretty cool i had the car the day before um.. thurs i think and i picked up jrod and she helped me shop for a cute shirt and stuff to wear soo yeah and then i had to work but i sneaked out of that bitch like at 8. Ok friday morning jessica woke me up at 7:30 that crazy bitch i was like wtf!! call me later!! but w/e then we got ready hit up MACdonalds on the way lol. then we got sniffed by some dogs and waited, waited, waited, waited, waited for our  bus. FINALLY at around idk 2 something the bus shows up its an ugly red one that says "" Celebration Christian Center"" on the side. im not kidding. we walk in and it was like stepping into a bus that napoleon dynamite would ride in. it was awful and smelled like a homeless guy took a shit in it lol. a couple of minutes into the ride the driver decides he needs to fill up on gas cuz duh he didnt put any before picking us up. then we step out and notice that hes leaking green liquid. which i proudly pointed out that it was radiator fluid. **shout out to luis** so he fills that bitch up w/ some more radiator fluid so that we could make it to the next stop lol. so we're driving of course we break down make a couple more stops fill it up w/ water u know the usual ghetto-ness. then we finally make it to orlando at no joke 7:45!! we missed the clubs and free food. then we met up w/ hosa there and we rode rides. all was well until we rode the popeyes ride 3 times and got soaked i ended up buying $27 spiderman pj pants and w/e so me and jessica go to change and our ""friends"" decide to go ride hulk. we get out of the bathroom w/ no cell phone and we dont know where they are. me and her were lost for about idk half an hour or so. once we find someone we know to lend us their celly we call our friends and theyre like oh yeah we're in line for the hulk. when we get to the hulk the ride was already shut down. me and jessica didnt get to ride it cuz some ppl who shall remain nameless were too freaking selfish to just wait 5 freaking min for us to change but w/e its all good cuz now i see how it is. oh yeah and to put the icing on our cake the chaperone lady was like ok guys lets tip the driver lmao i was like are you serious?!?! she got crazy 
the best part of gradbash... screaming tomatoes
the worst part of gradbash.. having sucky friends :( on a scale of 1- 10 theyre really bad lmao
thanks babe for picking us up on sat morn ur the greatest ;)"

You're shy<br>at times but friendly, and you are never weak<br>and always independent. You are incredibly<br>intelligent (wise beyond your years) and have a<br>talent for many things (sports, music, art).<br>You have a kind and warm personality and enjoy<br>the simple things. Like hanging out with<br>friends and watching movies at home. But you're<br>sometimes quiet nature makes you a bit of an<br>outcast and a mystery to people. No matter how<br>pretty you are or smart or athletic, you just<br>can't seem to break into the crowd and be<br>noticed. Don't worry, try to be more outgoing<br>and speak out when you have more to say. Don't<br>hide behind your books and sports and computer,<br>get out there and get noticed. You also have<br>deep desires in life and feel vunerable and<br>alone at times. Don't feel sad either, What<br>helps me to express feelings and dreams that I<br>can't say to people, is through my writting.<br>Maybe you should try.

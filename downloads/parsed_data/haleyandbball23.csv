"event","Have you ever had one of those days when you're just sitting in class and you wonder, where would I be if this did or didn't happen?  I had one of those days today.  I was sitting in class listening to a stupid lecture when I just completely spaced and just started wonderin, where would I be if I had never met Haley?  What would have happened if my dad married Karen and not my mom?  What if I had never met Lucas?  If I had never met Lucas, would I have ever met Haley and fallen in love with her?  If I had never met Haley, would I still be with Peyton?  Some of these thoughts scare me.  I mean, Haley is everything to me and the thought of not ever having her scares me to death.  Then the whole never meeting Lucas thing... he's my bro and he's gotten me through some pretty rough times... even when I'm pissed at him.  Me and Peyton still together???  Well, that would mean there would be a lot more fighting then there is between Haley and I.  The thought of Dan marrying Karen instead of my mom isn't that scary for me.  I mean, that would have taken all the pressure off of me to be so great in basketball.  Maybe then I would have met Haley sooner or I wouldn't have to deal with Dan in my life at all.  Well, those are just some of my random thoughts for today...

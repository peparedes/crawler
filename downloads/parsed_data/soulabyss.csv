"event","<lj-cut text=""Feelings About Canada Rockin' at the Olympics!!"">At the outset I wasn't too pleased with the Olympics.  I was miffed at all the ridiculous spending, especially those silly LED-lit rings out by the airport.  I mean, really, do we NEED LED rings out by the airport?  I'm pretty sure everyone who's coming to Vancouver knows what's going on.  -Anyway- I wasn't particularly interested in the whole thing at all.  Didn't watch the opening ceremonies, didn't watch any events on TV unless I happened to be at the gym and it was on.  I was happy when Canada won something, but it wasn't anything spectacular.

... And then I went to Vancouver on one of my days off last week.  I was surrounded by people who -were- interested, there was RED everywhere, everyone was so happy and excited.  It was hard not to get swept up in the sheer ""YAY""-ness of it all!  There was so much -CANADA- feeling, so much pride in our country and it just felt like everyone was coming together in support of all the athletes.  It was a great feeling :)  I hadn't planned on doing so but I went to see the Olympic Cauldron (from afar due to obscene amounts of fencing) and walked around a bit of downtown and took some pictures of some of the signs and whatnot that had been put up.  It was pretty epic for Canada, I think and it was neat to be able to go to Vancouver -while- it was going on.  That day was the day of the Canada VS Switzerland hockey game and we were all watching it on the ferry back to the island.  I'm not big on many sports but hockey is one I was definitely interested in.  I even called my parents on the bus to check on it because the ferry docked before the game was over.  I think that's when my ""Olympic Fever"" started.  When I came back to Victoria I had to get me a ""CANADA"" shirt.  Sadly no red ones left. :(  But I did get a yellow one!  

I still didn't watch much on TV at home, but I caught highlights now and then and whatever was playing at the gym.  I saw the women win gold, I watched the bobsleigh and snowboarding and speed skating.  Mostly it was hockey.  Today, for the gold medal game between Canada and the USA... I couldn't watch it.  I saw the US score their second goal at 30 seconds to go in the third period to tie it up and I turned it off, it was too insane.  Later in my room I heard whooping from outside.  I ran to the TV and we had WON! O_O!!  I was jumpin' up and down and screaming XD  

Despite my initial negative view of the games, I'm really proud of the Canadian athletes who gave it their all and gave us the best Olympics Canada has had yet and on HOME TURF no less!  And I'm so happy that our awesome country came together to cheer them on and show our pride in our country :)  Apparently we just needed an excuse to let it all out (so said our Prime Minister) and boy did we ever!!!  It was indeed a ""Sea of Red"" everywhere and I'm glad that I live in such an awesome country :D  I LOVE YOU CANADA!!!!!!!</lj-cut>"

- When I want to go? (Do I want to start with the Carnevale or end with it?)
- What do I want to do there? (Study or Work? or both?)
- How long do I want to stay? (weeks? months?... dare I say years? ;)

One passage in particular from Letter Eight</b>, which I first heard on the soundtrack to the Beauty and the Beast TV series) is especially soothing...

<i>So you mustn't be frightened, if a sadness rises in front of you, larger than any you have ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloud-shadows, moves over your hands and over everything you do. You must realize that something is happening to you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand and will not let you fall.</i>

In fact, the entirety of Letter Eight and Letter Seven are quite poignant and resonant to me at the moment.  If anyone would like to read these... here are links:

I also managed to find the long-lost <b>BACH BUSTERS</b> album online!!  This is one of my most favorite recordings of Bach, despite that it's on a synthesizer.  My family listened to it a lot in the loaner Ford Bronco we got when my dad's truck was being fixed.  I still loathe <i>Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring</i> but that's because it was the opening music for a music program on our old Commodore 64... gawd I miss that thing with the awesome summer & winter olympic games, the winnie the pooh game, the impossible mission game... the Barbie game!!!  I even enjoyed the ""match the states and state capitals"" game! :D  Takes me back to the days when we had to rent a VHS machine and it was a TOP LOADER with monstrously large buttons like something you'd see in a news room.  Oh~ the days of renting the latest National Geographic and the latest Vestron release (I MISS YOU <b>MONSTER SQUAD!!!!</b>...

I LOVE singing and being able to sing at the top of my lungs makes me -very- happy :D  So, yes, an incredible high and I come and sit down in front of the TV with my dinner and turn to the movie channel and catch what I must say is one of the hottest sex scenes in a movie EVAR (one from CRASH...

Very entertaining and keeps me from getting the ""blahs""!  I need to get some more...

I think the only one available right now that I'm interested in tho is Mishima Kazuhiko's ""Meiwaku no Ringo"".  Maybe they've got some for Yamane Ayano's stuff.  WHY HAS NEKOTA NOT PUBLISHED ANOTHER TANKOUBON YET?!?!?! ARGH!!!

Emily asked me last night if I was still interested in doing an FCS order with her.  I would like to but I think it'll have to wait until October when Volks releases their new FCS info with the much whispered about NEW BODIES.  Hopefully it will be one of the bigger bodies, SD17 would be preferrable for me.  I kind of got a bee up my butt about it today with ideas buzzing around in my head.  I was thinking of maybe making a doll for a favorite manga character, probably from Nekota's 'Kami-ude' series.  I really like Ernest (despite his 'meh' name).  I might make my Bory into ""Nekoko"" from Mishima's manga ""Love Neko"" :D  He would be so cute! :D  (and then I could finally have a boy who dresses all goth and emo ~_~)  At any rate, not doing anything with that until after October.

I DO think I will have to make an order from Toranoana... yes, yes I think I will...money, it burns!!!"

Also, in dollie news, they're really coming together now.  I've got Kenji right where I want him in terms of his appearance and his name.  I think I've pinned down my F-16, who shall now be referred to as Lyran ^_^  I bought a beautiful set of Chinese robes off of Yahoo!Japan and they look absolutely wonderful on him.  My Bory is proving difficult still.  I think he needs a new wig (something dark, black or brown or deep red) and new eyes (something in a shade of green) because right now he makes me think of Christina Aguilera and, pretty tho she is, that is NOT cool ~_~  He is still nameless (I was trying to make him a Julian but it just doesn't fit :T) so hopefully getting him ""just right"" will help that.  If not, well then I might have to find him a new home ;_;

I had some sun the other day and managed to find some fabric to drape over the ""potter"" chair so I took some pics.  I made them all colorful and fancy-like... not really hehe

Most often than not, if you think that way, you'll be left holding the bag/stranded.  Best just to do things on your own, figure things out for yourself because that's what everyone else is doing and they aren't gonna give a toss about you.

They did this oh~ maybe three or four times!  ;_;  GAWD I hate the Alliance!!

I couldn't believe I'd actually managed to get them without issue.  I was clicking 'refresh' every five seconds and then it popped up as ""good to go"" and I GOT IT!!! XD   So now my Yukijo <b>Kenji</b> will have his suit *_*~  This was the Dolpa 18 After Event... the actual Dolpa happened back in late December and, I admit it, I made an attempt to get another doll.  There was a lottery through the US Volks website for the limited edition dolls and as you may have seen in a previous entry, I wanted to try for Suigintou.  I entered the lottery and two of my friends did so for me as well.  And we all failed in that regard.  It's just as well because ALL of my ""Dolpa Luck"" went into this suit and the shoes and I GOT THEM!  And I could care less about the new doll now because a hawt boy that I already have will finally be able to BE HIMSELF.  SO HAPPY!!!!

In other news, I have fallen prey to the Evil that is World of Warcraft. ~_~ Where my former co-worker Sandi failed, my friend Emily has succeeded.  I think it's pretty fun.  I like making characters and doing quests.  I enjoy joining up with other players to complete quests.  I like the different things you can do with the different types of characters.  The environments are neat.  I don't know how long it will keep me interested though as questing and just killing things gets repetitive and every time you make a new character you have to go through the whole rigamarole of leveling them up and if you make same characters, you wind up having to do the same things over and over.  'S a bit tedious ~_~;;;  I guess the main point is to focus on one or two and get them up to max.  

I am THIS close to either getting an XBOX360 or a desktop PC.  One reason for the XBOX - BIOSHOCK!!!!!  Two reasons for the desktop... the display driver on my laptop keeps crapping out when I play WoW and BIOSHOCK!!!!!  This will likely not be happening because I have a trip to go on next year and I need money for that. XD  I can live without them for now.  I just hope my display doesn't die ~_~;;;;;;;"

I have decided.  I have WAY too much CRAP.  I was going through a box of mostly artbooks this evening and found my old binders full of pictures I'd traced, copied and coloured, notes I wrote with my friend, duotangs full of online conversations with people I haven't spoken to in at least ten years.  There were also paper bags full of stickers, a couple of mini-calenders, some of my term papers, notes from when I was in the SCA, so many notebooks full of course notes and scribblings, etc etc... CRAP!!!!  What I'd like to do is set up a circle of empty boxes, with the boxes that are full of CRAP in the middle and just take stuff out of the full boxes and sort it into the categorized empty boxes.  That way I would know where everything is and could throw away the TRUE CRAP or give the not-so-crap-that-i-don't-want away to other people.  

-WHY- do I keep all these things?  The other thing that bugs me is the stuff I do keep has to stay in boxes because I have nowhere else to put it.  :T  I tell ya, it really sucks to be relegated to just one room.  I'd put stuff out in the common room if I knew it wouldn't get stolen or played with.  I'd probably also have more room if I didn't have all these -boxes-.  Trouble is, I don't want to get rid of them because I never know when I'll be moving/have to move.  I feel so transitory ;_;  I wish I had a condo.  Anyone want to gift me a condo in Tuscany Village for Xmas? :P hehe"

XD  From where I remember most it started with me waking up and finding that my hair was falling out, in clumps when I ran my fingers through my hair to get the knots out.  I was slightly freaked out by this, I'm sure you can imagine.  So I was collecting all these clumps from my pillow and had a fair chunk.  I was upset.  I started going around my room and I -tried- to turn on the light, but it would just NOT turn on,  it fizzled and then I went over to it and noticed that one of the bulbs was smoking.  F*kc.  I think I left my room at this point... but I think I went around my room some more trying to find a light source, found a flashlight (I almost wrote ""torch"" XD).  I had also laid down on my bed and picked up a remote and watched some TV.  When I got up I noticed that I'd let go of most of the hair that I had been intending to show my mother because I wanted to know what was wrong.  I tried to pick it all back up, but it had been scattered around and I wound up with a fistfull of yarn and other hair-like crap as well as only a little of the amount of hair I'd had originally.  SO anyway, I go and find my mom and for some reason she's all ""la-dee-da"" and isn't really paying attention to what I'm saying and I got really mad, I think it was more about the lights than the hair at this point.  I actually grabbed the front of her shirt and said something like ""...but I'm -really- mad right now."" in a growly voice.  Then I went right into my room, slammed the door in her face and went to close the other door.  

I had several dollies in my room aside from my own.  I guess people just left theirs in my care?  Anyway, on one side of the room there was a set of shelves with two dolls on the top one (both boys, one with long red hair)  On the other side of the room were my dollies and one more.  I took this one more from there and brought it over to the shelves where to the two boy dollies were.  I tried setting this doll on one of the bottom shelves but they were too small and he didn't fit.  I may have tried setting him down on the top shelf, or I just held onto him, frustated that I couldn't find a spot.  Then I looked and noticed... ONE OF THE DOLLS HAD F-ING MOVED!!!! O_O!!!!!!   In the blink of an eye he, a LUTS Chiwoo with dark brown hair, maybe brown eyes and wearing a light pink track suit-like outfit, had switched spots.  It freaked the hell out of me.  And then he freakin' moved AGAIN and TALKED!  I picked him up and he was bigger, like the size of a toddler... but smaller o.O  And he TALKED and stuff!  We had a conversation for the love of GAWD!!  And then a cellphone started ringing and somehow it was in my hand, one of those little mini phones that people get for their dolls, and he grabbed my had and slapped it to his ear and answered the phone!  Told the person on the other line in an 'incognito' voice ""Yeah, I'm- I'm sorry I think you've got the wrong number.""  Then apparently we were off to a party/dollie meet?  Some get together and I was seriously treating him like a little kid.  Swinging him around in the air and he loved it!  Would try to get me to do it again, and I'm all ""Oh you want to swing again? :D"" and he'd be all ""Yes, please :)""  O-M-F-G it was ADORABLE! XD  I told him i wasn't giving him back to hiw owner and he was cool with that ^^;;;  Actually that may have been the person on the phone.

And then I got woken up by, I think, my alarm clock... at 5:30 because I can't turn it off.  I just started to laugh cos the dream was so freakin' AWESOME... and it was SO REAL!!!  -SO- real!!  I'm pretty sure I was suprised to wake up from it. o.O;  I can't believe I had a dream like this... without being under the influence of dairy products or my ""Waterscapes"" CD.  ...amazing..."

"event","I went downtown today to check out the Greater Victoria Concert Band.  They were putting on an open air concert in Market Square.  It was damn cold and just before I left it was POURING rain.  Luckily it stopped... it's because I took my golf umbrella with me.  I like to call it my ""insurance"".  I went mostly to hear the Intermediate band because I'm considering joining the band and wanted to hear what they were like.  (Un)fortunately I came a bit late for that and wound up getting there just as the senior band was setting up.  They played -very- well.  It's not a really large band either.  I wound up talking with a gentleman who is in the intermediate band.  It sounds like a lot of fun and they're probably quite friendly if the guy I talked to is any indication.  SO I'm going to try it out... in the new year ^^;  I have to get my flute cleaned and probably re-pad-ed.  I have to re-learn my music ~_~;;;

On a completely different note...

Is it wrong of me to think that some of the Wraith in <b>Stargate Atlantis</b> are hot?  ^^;;;  I haven't seen much of it, but that one ep where they've captured one and have it in a holding cell...?  (apparently, he is referred to as ""Steve""... reminds me of the ""Steve"" in <b>Over the Hedge</b> ""Let's call it Steve!"") He's hot.  I feel dirty XD;;"

I got right in.  You should have seen it in months previous though... it was a line that almost circled the entire block, at 6am.  When I actually got to the passport office itself it -was- a bit busy and they had to give you a number, but it didn't take very long to talk to someone.  Trouble was... I was sitting next to some guy who would -not- stop talking.  It wouldn't have been so bad had I not had a headache and if he would have been the slightest bit interested in letting -me- say something.

What the hell is THIS -<a href=""http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/characters.aspx"">Care Bears characters</a>-???  Um, ""Oopsy Bear""??  Are we appealing to infants with this?  Dude, that would be -WISH BEAR- in the normal universe.  See the shooting star on their belly??  W-I-S-H BEAR.  And what happened to Bedtime Bear, not to mention TENDER HEART???  What's Share Bear doing in there, she wasn't an 'original' Care Bear, she was a Care Bear, well, not cousin, but was introduced later.  

HMPH ~_~ I just wiki'd this whole thing and it turns out that despite the fact that only Grumpy, ""Oopsy"" ~_~;;, Funshine, and Love-A-Lot were available on this one page, they are, in fact starting out with more than that, at least in their new 'movies'. ~_~;  And I'm ashamed to say they're also selling... *gag* Jungle print versions on the plushies ;_;  Were the originals not cute enough for you people??  ;_;  Why mess with a good thing? ;_;  Now they're not even fuzzy...and seem of far lesser quality than the ones made in 'the good ol' days' when -I- was young.  

It's like the new Barbie.  She doesn't even -look- like Barbie anymore.  She looks more like a Bratz doll, with huge head.  It's -creepy-.  I -did- see a Glowworm toy the other day that was -really- cute though... too bad it makes music and it's for babies ~_~  I really wanted one of those when I was a kid.  Dana gifted me a Cabbage Patch Kid for my b-day/Xmas last year so that's one childhood wish granted ^^;  It just makes me sad that I won't be able to replace? my ORIGINAL Bedtime Bear if he ever kicks the bucket... the market will be saturated with this inferior copies ~_~;  POO.

That's right, I'll say it, I HATE change!  Don't mess with the stuff from my childhood dammit, that stuff is PRICELESS!!! XO  I find it amusing that I get so ticked off about things from my childhood being 'updated'.  Do I still -watch- Care Bears?  No.  I guess it's kind of like that line from... I think the song's called ""Untitled"" by Simple Plan?  The line's something like ""...I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered""...  I am holding on to quite a bit from my childhood and it makes me very sad to know that a lot of that stuff, and not only stuff but things that happened, things that I did, friends I had and whatnot, it makes me sad to know that I will never, ever get that back."

Also changed my Bory's eyes to 14mm and they look SO much better!  You can see the whites! but... now he looks like a little devil ;_; Scary!  I also now know how to make it so that their eyes don't 'float' into positions I don't want.

I bought some Xmas lights... well, A LOT of Xmas lights.  Since I don't have a tree (aside from my mini one that I've had since I was maybe 5 XD) I put them up all around my room.  I have some white normal lights, coloured normal lights and two sets of LED lights, one coloured and one blue. (MOM: If you're reading this, you should get the blue LED -RICE- lights... they're exactly like the blue airport lights you like ;) )  It's really nice and 'atmospheric' in my room now *_*~  I -love- mini lights~~~~~

While I was waiting for the bus, I saw an apartment building that's pretty much all bachelor apartments.  It looked quite new too.  I think it would be nice to live there, but it's more like a hotel in terms of there being no main entryway with a buzzer.  The apartments all have their doors open to the outside directly.  Not sure I like that.  :T  I wonder how much it is though.  There was a heritage building downtown I had been eyeballing for a possible move, but Maggie informed me the other day that it is ""low-income"" housing and was fairly crime-ridden until recently.  Not looking at that anymore ^^;;  I think I will have to move out after the Europe trip regardless.  Maggie is quite intent on moving to the UK and then I'll have to move anyway.  The trouble is... the expense. ~_~  Oh well, when the time comes I am sure something will work itself out.

OH!! I also got to play... *_*... ASSASSIN'S CREED!!!!!! OMFGH!! *_*  Altair is my hot hot sex~  And I got to play it on her big screen HDTV *_*... oh~ the killing was awesome!!! XD  I can't say much more about it because, it was just breathtaking overall and I didn't get very far in it ^^

I just feel like I have absolutely -nothing- right now (with the exception of this Europe trip, which Maggie is actually doing all the planning for and my parents who never fail to be there for me ^^)  But honestly, that's -it-.  I've said before, all I do is go to work, come home and plunk myself down in front of the TV.  I will probably attempt to work on my MP3s but don't get very far.  

But in -good- news, I booked the suite in the Chateau de Guerinet that we wanted.  <a href=""http://www.loirechateau.com/rent-chateau-france-diane-suite.php""><b>The Diane Suite</b></a> It's got both a FOUR-POSTER BED, but also a CHAISE LONGUE!!!

I will make a point that this is the ONLY time I can do this trip with my friend... and if they say ""NO"" I'm damn near prepared to quit in order to go.  This is probably an extreme, but I'm NOT giving this up dammit.  This is one of the FEW things I have to look forward to.

I was 'scared' into getting my Tokidoki bag the other day.  Maggie and I were looking at the website and the ""Stellina"" bag in the Vacanze print had already sold out.  I didn't want to risk my ""Campeggio"" bag selling out so I bought it ^^;;  I'm looking forward to it for various reasons... 1- It's bigger than the Stellina and this I will not have to carry TWO bags around  2- It's the VACANZE PRINT! *_* Two awesome things combined: a winter theme and adorable Tokidoki characters :D  3- the shoulder strap is longer and will therefore not hang right under my armpit.

I think I'll spend this Sunday looking for the iTunes gift card I got for XMas last year so I can buy Shel Silverstein's <b>Where The Sidewalk Ends</b> album.  Then I'll only have to get <b>A Light in the Attic</b> from Amazon or somewhere.  I also need to get the 5th Dimension's ""Age of Aquarius"".

(I had tried this and it didn't work/couldn't find/it was JUST the drivers and not the software else I would not have called them asking for the CD)  And he couldn't believe that no one had previously suggested that I try this route ~_~#  So, he directs me toward the place I can download the WHOLE thing and VOILA!  I have the freakin' software XO!  I could have had it WEEKS ago!!  ARGH!!!!"

"event","...to deal with customer service at Brother.  Despite the guy I spoke to the -last- time I had to call regarding my gXddamn CD, the guy said his co-workers were idiots for not getting the CD right.  WELL!  He's not much better.  He, in fact, sent me ink cartridges as 'reparations' for being so retarded with the previous botched send-outs BUT the ink cartridges, which arrived today, ARE NOT FOR MY MODEL!!!!!!  O-M-F-G!  How incompetant can you GET?!?!

So, now I have to call them AGAIN, a FOURTH time and say ""Look, thanks for the cartridges, the thought was great, but you sent me cartridges for a different model than the one I have.  Also, the CD was not included with them.  I can't USE cartridges unless I can operate the printer, and I can't do that without THE CD!!!  I will send the cartridges back because I can't use them.  Please don't send me any more, all I want is the GODDAM FXCKING CD!!!!!"" XO XO XO XO XO

I am SO PISSED OFF!!!!!  (But <b>Transformers</b> is making it a little better, not to mention the fact that I excercised tonight XD  GO ME!)"

These commercial breaks consist mainly of toy commercials and I'm thinking, ""Well, Christmas -is- only two months away..."" and then I realized it.  <i>I am watching YTV</i>, of COURSE the ads are going to be nothing but toys.  Kids don't care about mortgages and cars. Oh~ the carefree days..."

"event","HA!  I can finally get some measure of ""get back-ness"" at my annoying roommate who uses all the water...

I DID MY LAUNDRY THIS MORNING!! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

She's already done laundry this weekend, on Friday and Amanda did hers yesterday.  So, I figure I'm good to go but, just in case, I started first thing when Maggie opens the door to downstairs.  Good thing I did too.  Just as my first load was finishing, Annoying Roomie went downstairs to attempt to do MORE laundry.  She spent a minute or so down there, maybe checking to make sure there really was laundry other than hers in the washer?? ~_~;  So I went down there after she came back up to put in my second load, cos there's no way in hell I'm going to say ""Oh sure, you go ahead and do yours first :D"".  I'm very tempted to suggest that we have our own laundry days.  If you don't get it done on that day, tough shit.  When there are three people sharing laundry facilities you should be doing it all at once.  Mind you, it's not as bad as having to share with a whole apartment complex.  THAT gets tricky.

In other medical news, I think I've really fxed up my right knee somehow... probably jumping around while exercising. :T  Thanks exercise, you wound me. ;_;"

"event","I am -so- utterly drained.  I had to get a pelvic ultrasound today and for that you have to drink around 4 full glasses of fluids so that your bladder is full and they can take a better look.  Well, I grabbed my 500ml bottle and started drinking water at around noon (they said you have to be finished drinking an hour before your appointment).  My appointment wasn't till 3pm, but I figured I'd be able to hold my water...  I was SO wrong.  After the first full bottle, I had to pee like nobody's business X_X  So, bladder empty, I try again... one bottle.  And once more I was going to explode...  To the bathroom I went...  and about an hour before my appointment I chugged the two bottles of fluids I needed to (32oz is about 1000ml) and I was on my way.  It almost made me vomit ;_;  Lucky for me, one of the ladies I work with was leaving at the same time as me and offered me a ride.  I got there and I had to pee so bad, but I couldn't.  Waited for about 20 minutes and then I get to do the ultrasound.  The tech who did it was a bit of a jerk :T  I kind of like friendly banter with medical people, but he was having none of it.  It was -really- hard to 'hold it' while he was pressing that little picture wand into my belly x_X  The pressure on the bladder was quite painful ;_;  I hope I don't have to do another one of those for a VERY long time."

"event","Okay, so I've got a multi-function printer thingie.  I had installed all the software on my previous, now dead, laptop.  While I was -pretending- to move so that annoying roomies would leave as well, I seem to have lost the disc that contained the software for the printer to work on my new laptop.  SO I called Brother for to ask them to send me a new disc.  They said ""SURE!""  Problem is, it never showed up.  I call again relaying this information and they verify my address... lo and behold they'd sent it to ALBERTA for some reason.  SO they say we'll send you another one.  AWESOME!  So I FINALLY get the disc... and today I tried to install the software, but it was -not- working.  I tried everything.  I installed with the USB out, with it in, restarted.  Nothing.  So I call Brother up again to ask what I'm doing wrong (I figured maybe I was going into the wrong folder... all they sent me was a ripped copy of a CD, it wasn't official or anything o.O)  So the guy asks me if the USB is plugged in and I said YES... he says ""Okay that's -wrong-, pull it out""  ~_~;;; Ok, so I did that and then he asked me to check the folder and it turns out that the CD they sent me, though it had the model # of MY machine Sharpied on the disc, the FOLDER for the program was actually for a completely different model... and THAT is why it wasn't working.  SO the guy apologizes profusely (even going so far as to call his colleagues idiots or something like that) and says he'll send me some free inks along with the -correct- disc.  MAN, the things I do to be able to scan things ~_~"

"event","I am taking extreme measures with my dolls.  I have come to a decision.  I do not have the means to make the dolls that I have into what I envisioned them, so I have to do some rearranging.  It is incredibly frustrating to me to look at my dolls, who are sitting on my chest of drawers, and just see them as pretty resin things.  They are not -my- boys right now because I haven't been able to -make- them thus.  Aside from the face on my Yukijo, no one is quite right and should I not be spending money to get them to a point where I'm overwhelmingly proud of them instead of on new dolls? 

I know I've said this before and I've fallen off the wagon.  But this time, THIS time, I'm going to, as Captain Picard put it, ""Make it so!""  I've set out plans, I -will- be putting them into effect.  Dammit.  

- I will be selling 90% of my current dollie clothing possessions
- I will only be keeping three dolls
- One of these will be getting a new face
- getting ALL NEW outfits (from proceeds of clothing sales, etc.)
- and there's gonna be -story- BY TUNDER!!"

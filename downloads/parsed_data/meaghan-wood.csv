<lj-cut text=""Let's not BLOW this out of proportion."">

1.  I'm so glad  we've been hanging out more and more lately. You're fucking amazing.

2. I don't get what happened with this friendship but apparently I and others aren't as important anymore. Whatever dude.

3. I really hope you'll find your way back. It's too amazing over here to go and chill with assholes.

4. Sometimes you're the biggest dick and I think I can't handle anymore of your stupid shit, then you skip into the period when you're the nicest person alive. Stop being so fucking confusing!

5. I'm so jealous of you and everything you have that I don't. Lucky.

6. I would consider you one of my best friends at the moment. You rock.

7. Thank god you stepped back into the picture from that year or two of being gone. I missed you and you're amazing.

8. You. I love you. You and many others are awesome fronds.

9. I hate you beyond all human knowledge. You're such a fucking bitch. I'm sure my boyfriend's hotter than any guy you'll ever end up with, cunt. Go diaf.

10. I don't know what to write to you.. except, hang out with us more, you dumbass! xD

</lj-cut>

So, I finished Breaking Dawn and it was epic, I thought. I do want Jacob to diaf though. Moreso than I ever did.

I bought the Girlicious album today and it was truly fucking amazing. I got a free pass to the Orange Lounge party that they'll be at on the 25th with my CD. Life is amazing."

Anywaysssss. Kate needs to die, quickly. Of course she won't because no one on the A-Team ever dies. Geez. 

Anyways, I don't have a huge rant, but that's it. I don't want Kate to raise Aaron, but if she is off the island, Claire better still be alive on the island. God, these writers are assholes. But thank god they're off strike! : D"

6. Every boy's the same, since up in the seventh grade, they've been trying to get&nbsp;with me..

7. What's the use in you denying that what you had was wrong?

8. I heard that you were talking shit and you didn't think that I would hear it.

9. They called me Cinderella, all you had to do was yell, and I'd be there for you.

10. You saw me standing alone without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.

11. Wise men say 'Only fools rush in', but I can't help falling in love with you.

12. I died so many years ago, but you can make me feel, like it isn't so. Why you come to be with me, I think I finally know.

13. Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me.

14. I'm just a crazy kind of girl, I'll tell it to the world. I've just begun having my fun, yeah.

15. Days grow shorter and the nights are getting cold. It seems like we're running out of time.

16. Robot, robot, robot some shit in Russiaannnnnn...

17. When there's no&nbsp;where else to run is there room for one more sun, one more sun?

18. Then I see you standing there, wanting more from me and all I can do it try.

19.&nbsp;I don't need a hundred gifts under the tree. Don't you know the best thing you can give to me. Nothing else will do, all I want is you this Christmas.

20. ...Things ain't going my way. And everything is wrong, my life is a country song.

21. I'm alive, I can feel the blood rushing through my veins.

22. What would it take for you to just leave with me?

23. O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining..

24. Sick and tired of hearing all these people talk about 'What's the deal with this pop life and when's it gonna fade out?""

25. We are, we are, we are all just children, finding our way around in decision."

I have a 88.8% average, which is fucked up for me xD I'm still quite enjoying my schoolings except I'm starting to hate my Hospitality class. Oh, I get to find out my blood type tomorrow in Forensics lol. I don't really want to get my finger pricked but it'll happen cause I'm really curious as to what my blood type is xD

Uhhhh.. I can't really think of anything else. I bought my ipod from my Royal pay which is bloody fantastic. I've been waiting for a good year for that so I'm happy. On Thursday I'll be buying a tna bag, simply because my current bag has a nice huge rip in it and those tna bags can fit like, 5 corpses in it... Not that I'd want to fit.. 5.. corpses.. -shifty eyes-

Anywaysss.... Yeah. I'm still leading a boring life xD It's almost 2 years with Drew and I, which is also fucked up cause that's a long friggen time xD

After that, I guess that's it. I've been missing much of the third season of Supernatural -tears- So I'm gonna have to spend a long time on Youtube catching up xDD But I won't be missing any Lost. I will be staying at Drew's when (or if, stupid writer's strike) that shit finally airs.

The tv went quiet all of a sudden xD Okay.. that's done."

Cause that school sucks shit xD I have perfect attendence so far and have only really been late like.. twice.<br /><br />So, first semester is:<br /><br />Period 1: Forensic Science<br />Period 2: English<br />Period 4(period 3 is lunch lulz): Photography<br />Period 5: Food Prep<br /><br />And my second semester will be:<br /><br />Period 1: Photography 12<br />Period 2: Cosmetology<br />Period 4: Parenting<br />Period 5: Forensics 12<br /><br />God, it's awesome.<br /><br />Max and I went to see Resident Evil: Extinction yesterday.. and I strive to be just like Alice. That movie was so amazing, I probably had many orgasms over and over. Everyone MUST see it, even if you haven't seen the first two. I'm sure Max will agree with me on that one.<br /><br />Uhhhh, what else? On Monday, I'm going to an exhitbition game.. the Leafs. Against Ottawa. It's not a REAL game that counts for anything, but it's still my first hockey game xD Most likely, Drew's coming, obviously. Uhhhhh..<br /><br />I think that about covers it. xD So, clearly I have a boring life.</p>"

This is what I get for skipping that time for about three months, isn't it? I must have forgotten what these cramps felt like, because I'm dying over here. Stupid Dominion didn't have the Tylenol that I always buy during these five days, so going to Drew's, I had nothing to help the pain.

And it sucks. It's now 11-ish in the morning, but I've been up almost all night. I fell asleep around 3.30 am and got maybe about an hour and a half worth of sleep. I remember waking up around 5-ish, but I was able to fall asleep maybe for like, another half hour. Then, I was up. Okay, lies. I was up all through the hour of 6 am, but I'm pretty sure I slept through 7 am.

I woke up again at 8-ish and have been up since. The cramps haven't backed down, and it sucks to suffer completely silently while trying not to wait up your adorable, sleeping boyfriend next to you. Overall, it was a horrible night.&nbsp;

Now, I'm still getting cramps, but they're shorter than before and there's a much larger space of time between them. But, I feel sick to my stomach. It really, really sucks.

Anyways, I was watching tv last night and Hal Sparks was on a celebrity version of ""Fear"" from MTV.. except the show wasn't Fear and it wasn't MTV xD It was called Celebrity Paranormal something. But he and a few others were investigating a haunted sanitorium. And unlike those other shows, I actually SAW the things they did. Like, shadows walking around, there were disturbances in the cameras, screams being heard. It was creepy.

Hah. Claire's having the exact same pain as me in my mood pic.. Except her cramps are much more intense, I'm sure."

Oh! And they're re-releasing their movie into the theatres! Boo yeah. I'm totally gonna waste money to go see it again haha.

This is going to bug me alll summer, and September, October, November, December and January. Do you realize that is almost two entire seasons without LOST?

God. This sucks, Why didn't they just do 2 more seasons of 24 episodes, instead of 3 seasons of 16 episodes. So gay.

On another note, I'll have some movies that are coming out to hold me until LOST comes back. Like October, near Halloween.. Saw 4. Damn mother fuckin straight. Oh, and December 21st is the one Bhavna, Beth and I are DYING for; National Treasure: Book of Secrets.

That's right. My father, Nicolas Cage, is back with sexy Riley and an awesome adventure filled with danger and LOTS of American history. Boo yeah! Lol.

There's a fire within my soul.<br /><br />5. Who are you now? Are you still the same or did you change somehow?<br /><br />6. From the highest of highs to the depths of the sea. Creations revealing your majesty. (Again, no one.)<br /><br />7. When it seems all your hopes are dreams are a million miles away, I will reassure you.<br /><br />8. If people try to put you down, just walk on by don't turn around. You only have to answer to yourself.<br /><br />9. I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things don't always stay that way.<br /><br />10. Gotta be wholesome, I could loathsome it's just I'm a little bit shy.<br /><br />11. I went walking with my momma one day when she warned me what people say. Live your life until love is found, cause love's gonna get you down.<br /><br />12. Do you know what it feels like loving someone&nbsp;that's in a rush to throw you away?<br /><br />13. Nobody can tell ya there's only one song worth singin. They may try and sell ya, cause it hangs them up to see someone like you.<br /><br />14. Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city. Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty.<br /><br />15. I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't understand.<br /><br />16. Am I more than you bargained for yet? <font size=""5"">OY!!!</font> (I gave that one away.)<br /><br />17. Now my bloodshot eyes are burning. Working out why this ain't working.<br /><br />18. Some say love is not for sinners, I believe that isn't true. Cause when I was finished sinning, love came down and showed me you.<br /><br />19. I know you like me. I know you do. That's why whenever I come around she's all over you. (Easy.)<br /><br />20. I keep turnin em down, but they always come around, asking me to go around.

So, all I had to do was reach around like, an inch, to turn on the light, but&nbsp;I couldn't do it cause I had a feeling that something was going to grab my hand. So I ran back into Drew's room and quickly grabbed my large stuffed Mumble and had to go back down. I was shaking and everything.

The interview with the VP only took less than five minutes, than I had to go to guidance to pick out my courses and that only took about 5 minutes as well. So I waited like, an hour for a whole ten minutes. I got there at 1.15 and left at 2.30.

Ah man. So these are apparently my courses. The guidance chick was pushing some of them on me so I just said yes, lol.

Photography (Grade 11)
Photography (Grade 12, second semester)
English
Fashion
Cosmetology
Forensic Science
Parenting
Food Prep

Boo yeah. How many of those had I actually chosen before I walked into that building? English, Photography, Forensics, Parenting and Food Prep. So, she forced the second photography, fashion and cosmetology onto me xD And it was only because I said I was a little bit interested in Cosmetology. She was like ""That's a good course. You should take it. Fashion too."" Lol.

Oh well, maybe it'll actually give me some good fashion tips.. and maybe my hair will actually be good now hahaha."

"event","Oh my, last night was way too intense. But I loved it.

If you could call it ""pre-drinking"" at my place, that wasn't very fun. I was still completely sober when we left, but I got drunk enough after shortly arriving at the club. I meant Lloyd and Junie bought me my first beer. Chrystina pulls me into the bathroom, and I gave my beer to Amanda, and once I came back for it, I couldn't find her, so I ended up losing that beer. Junie bought me another one shortly, and VERY shortly after, Shane bought me one xD So, I had two beers to finish.&nbsp;

We started dancing and such, which was much fun. I kissed Tatjana and Cathee.. Chrystina kinda forced me into a kiss xDD Uh, everything else was pretty much dancing and talking until I started feeling really sick. And, Shane was trying to hold my hand and when that happened, my mind instantly flipped to Drew. I got up, went to the bathroom and puked my heart out. It felt good lol.

After thinking about Drew whilst puking, I returned to our area and was, yes, crying lol. I remember a security guy coming over and was like ""Are you okay?"" I tried to explain why I was upset, but June was just like ""It's her first night out."" And he understood lol.

So, after that, it was done for me and June got me into a cab and sent me home. I got home, and puked some more before falling asleep.

I woke up with a HORRIBLE hangover, but it's finally gone lol. And the day's almost over. I still need to prepare for my Science seminar tomorrow, so, y'know.&nbsp;

I really miss Drew. He's coming back tomorrow, but you know, I'm still really missing him, all because of last night lol. So, I'm going to call him and enjoy my conversation with him tomorrow &lt;3"

He would always say that we'd do that together and we never did until now xD So, yeah, I'm excited about that. I get to spend time with my bunny while doing something that he likes and I don't mind.<br /><br />Yesterday, in his backyard, he and I were playing ""hockey"" lol. I can't really call it hockey cause I'm shit. He's always trying to get me to score on him but it's hard when I'm at a stage even lesser than a beginner and he's a very skilled goalie already. Lol. Fair? No xD And today, we were kicking a soccer ball back and forth. It was actually fun. It was all because of the lovely weather. He took me to a valley near his place and it was reaaallly pretty. It would be such a perfect place to spend with a boyfriend/girlfriend when it's full bloom spring with all the new leaves and pretty flowers and shit.<br /><br />Yeah, that was my adventure. He's going to London (Ontario) next weekend, so I don't get to see him, but it's good, cause the Monday following, I have a seminar due so I can have no distractions on the weekend and work on that. I MIGHT work at the new soccer stadium on Saturday, but I doubt it. I need a MLSE course and a First Aid/CPR course before I can work there, but I'm only booked for the MLSE one tomorrow.. No first aid one yet.<br /><br />That's fine. It'll still give me more time to do school work.<br /><br />That being said...<br /><br /><font size=""6"">2 MORE DAYS UNTIL MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!<br /></font><br />That's right, folks. I'll be the nice legal age on Tuesday April 24th. It's gonna be sweet, minus the fact that I don't have any ID yet, so I can't get into Zen, nor buy any booze until I get some ID.</p><p>That's all I got so far..

Friggin, the last Marlies game was yesterday, so the Ricoh is basically done. Now, the bad news for me is, the first show at the Amp is only on May 26th. What does this mean for me? Unless there's random concerts at the Ricoh between now and then, I'm out of a fucking job. I have 27 bucks until Thursday, then I'll get around 160, which 60 bucks need to go to my phone right away.. Then, even if I don't spend a single penny for another two weeks.. I'll only get about 45 bucks from that next cheque.. So 145 until June 14th? No.. Ain't gonna happen. I need money to pay for my phone, then for my pills..

And I have so much shit due for school. I'm once again, slacking and it's really pissing me off. Like, how hard is it to make a single fact sheet with three sources? It's taking me fucking hours cause I'm not motivated.

And for the Amp and/or BMO Field, you need to take some stupid course that are gonna be completely useless to me, but you know, they have to be taken. It pisses me right the fuck off.

AND when I'm completely poor, Luc goes and cooks a supper than I fucking hate, and that's probably what we're gonna have tomorrow, so I'm pretty much not eating for two days, unless I spend some fucking money, which I can't afford to do.

Fuck man, the world is tapping my shoulder.. I'm having a Dane Cook moment and it fucking sucks.

Now I'm off to fucking Taco Bell to feed myself with money I can't afford to spend.

It was at the corner of Richmond and Yonge. I was hanging out with some people, including Drew.. but it was weird, cause Drew was ushering and ripping tickets from random people on the street. And he wasn't ripping them for a reason.. They just walked by and handed him tickets that he ripped..

We all had food from Taco Bell and I had the most and there was like, a mountain of that shredded cheese.. why? Apparently I was very pregnant. I believe it was eight months, but I didn't look very big.. It was weird. I think I was close to labor too xD Cause everytime I took a bite of my food, my stomach would hurt and I'd feel sick.. Then again, that might have been the fast food.

Of course it was Drew's kid. I remember walking up behind him while he was ""working"" and he ""took a break"" and sat down to eat with me..&nbsp;

Yeah, I know, it wasn't ALL that weird, but the feeling I get from thinking about it is just creepy.

And no, I'm not pregnant xD I haven't had sex enough to become pregnant, so yeah."

"event","I went to the doctor's today to get my pap test.

It was horrible.. It was awkard and very uncomfortable. It took, like, five minutes cause it was the first time and he was explaining EVERYTHING. I mean, c'mon, don't you think I would have read up on paps before I came? Wouldn't I know what's needed to be known?

Anyways, once that was done (he also gave me a breast exam) I got dressed again and had to go give some blood.&nbsp;

This woman, I swear to God. She was tiny, and I never knew that people that small could cause SO MUCH PAIN! Oh Lord. She sticks the needle into my right arm, and that fucking hurt SO much. Then she was about to take the blood, when I hear her say, ""Shoot!"". Like, c'mon. So, she had to get the blood from my other arm. She sticks a new needle into my left arm, which also hurt like hell, then took like, five vials.

Three fairly small, one smaller than the rest, and one was very fucking large. It was gross. I looked back when she was done and the vials were sitting right in front of me. Ew.

I think the only good part of that was the urine sample xDDD Oh, and the fact that I don't have to go back for another year. Wo0t!

Anyways.. that's all I have to say.

Oo! I'm keeping up with my homework. I finished those Ancient Greek and Rome religion questions and got perfect on them. I finished my Spanish assignment (I forgot to add that to my list in my last entry), and she seemed impressed. xD

So, I'm feeling rather exhausted, so I may just go lay in the bed and work ahead on my Spanish. We're gonna get questions to do over March Break, and I know what they are, so I might as well finish them now.

I also need to start my English essay. I searched for some constellation stuff for my Science and copied some notes. I'm gonna have to read those over, pick good stuff and rephrase it. -sigh- Working hard sucks.

Oh. I also had a quiz today on Zoroastrianism (Iran religion xD), and I'm pretty sure I did decent enough on that.&nbsp;

OH! Lol, and today I learnt that my World Religions teacher, Ms Beaudry, is pregnant! I think that's fantastic. She came into class today and I was wondering why she looked&nbsp;a bit fatter than normal xD Then I learnt it was cause she is five months along.. It never showed before today, strange. And I had her on Tuesday too... Weird.

-shrug- She better not leave before the end of the year. Ms Dent had her baby in December, Ella Elizabeth Dent. She was so cute. My science teacher's four months along.. It's crazy how many people are pregnant, lol.

Anyways, I think that's all for now..

"event","I just finished my questions on Ancient Greek and Roman religion.. 19 questions in total.&nbsp;- Due Thursday.

Now, I still have to do the population pyramids for Geography. Seeing as my group didn't tell me which year to do, I'll just redo all four graphs myself and hand in the one they need. Maybe I'll complete the questions too. - Due Friday.

Then, I need to get started on my English essay, which is due the Monday after March break. That'll probably be worth a good chunk of marks. - Due March 19th.

After that, I need to begin research for my Science ISU, which I, stupidly, decided to do on my own. So, I'm&nbsp;doing the Mythology of the constellations. Of course, I need to add the science behind the constellations as well, which will be kinda hard. Fact sheet - Due April 10th. Seminars begin&nbsp;April 30th.

ARGH.

Anyways, I'd love a surprise birthday party.. Lol."

"event","Yes, Hallmark day is coming and I'm stumped.

Drew isn't into the romantic, intimate gifts, so anything I were to get him, he'd think would be cheesy, lol. He says to just give him money, but I don't think that would be Valentine's Day worthy. Would it? I saw something at Carlton Cards that I wanna get him, and Junie's basket thing gave me the idea of doing that too, but then if I get him that stuff, he probably wouldn't be too happy cause it'll all be cheesy in his mind.

Gr. Shopping for boys sucks. Especially on Valentine's.

Also, where should we go for dinner? We've gone to the Pickel Barrell SOOOO many times, and EVERYWHERE's gonna be packed, no matter where we go. Gr. So tough.

Any ideas?"

"event","UPDATE: I'm very sad that I didn't get enough sleep last night. That was clear when my mom woke me up at 7.30 in the morning... When I had only went to bed at 5 AM. Aw well. Guess I'll just sleep through class. And you know what's pissing me off? This printer. Why won't it print?!

I couldn't sleep and it's now 4.30 AM with school in the morning, but I'm not sleeping. Instead, I'm up watching Six Feet Under. I've already seen all the episodes, but I like the show, sue me. 

Anyways, Nate has this brain thing that puts him in an overnight coma, but when he wakes up, he breaks up with his pregnant wife, Brenda. It's things like that that make me realise how much I actually do love Drew. 

I watch these scenes on TV and I put myself in that situtation, and I usually end up crying because I feel like my heart's been broken. Lol. I didn't cry tonight, but it was still pretty upsetting. She was pregnant too. And the worst part of it was that Nate was with his mother's husband's daughter... So, basically, his sister-in-law, HAVING SEX WITH HER, when his brain thing eruptted and he collasped. Well, they were done, but the fact of the matter is, he cheated.&nbsp; 

I hate cheaters. So, I'm kinda glad his character died, cause, frankly.. He's an asshole. You don't cheat on your wife, go into a coma (obviously not his fault, but still) and then when you wake up, break up with your wife, who looked to be about 7 or so months along. That's just wrong. 

On another note, were I to be born a boy, my name would have been Nate, lol.&nbsp; 

Also, I was thinking of Junie's entry, the one about the choose your own adventure stuff, and it got me thinking. What if I had never gone to Jarvis? Would I have met someone at another school and got together sooner? Would I have already felt the pain of being dumped or cheated on? Would I still be with someone when Drew&nbsp;came along? I wouldn't have been able to be with Drew and frankly, that thought sucks. 

I love Drew and he's great. Of course our relationship isn't perfect, but whose is? We barely fight, and when we do, you can't call them fights cause they're just silly arguements that last five minutes, then we're both over it and hugging and stuff again. It's great.&nbsp; 

I really should be getting to bed, but I'm not tired. I will be tomorrow, oh will I be. I'll be at work, and either jumping for joy, acting like an idiot, or just standing around, scanning tickets mindlessly. So, I hope I don't get suites tomorrow, because I'll surely fall asleep up there seeing as I wouldn't be able to even read. 

I should probably go to sleep before Luc gets up. He'll be all like ""Why are you still up? jhdsouwegfkuwgf"" lol.&nbsp; 

Night."

"event","Well, Happy New Year! I didn't post it before, but I am now. I'm insanely bored right now, so I might as well share my New Year's, as everyone else has.

I ended up going to Drew's friend's party, seeing as Junie sucked this year and didn't do anything. I was gonna go to a party that Bhavna and Robbie were having, but Drew and I are cheap asses and didn't want to pay money that would have been used for movies and such. It's a good idea, yes, but.. We're cheap lol. So, his friend, Ana, lives in Missisauga(I know I spelt that wrong), so we got to take some free transit there and back. We had a very large bottle of Smirnoff, but barely drank any of it. Instead, he and I mooched off everyone else.

Ana was awesome, the other girl, Kasey, I think her name was, was awesome. Everyone was awesome. There was a group of people who showed up who no one really talked to, so I didn't get to know them. Ana was drunk before 11.30 and she had only started drinking about 20 minutes eariler, lol. We didn't have a TV down in the basement, so we had to rely on everyone's watches and when it was midnight, everyone was screaming and such and enjoying life.

All the couples were practically making out (Got my New Years kiss &lt;3) and then we partied. Kasey was slowly getting drunk, and, oh my god, this is the kicker... Drew was drunk before I was even buzzed. It was fucking awesome. By the end of the night though, I was drunk. Kasey's boyfriend, whose name I didn't catch, ended up sharing his beer with me, which I love him for lol. Drew found a new love for beer after drinking all that nasty-ass vodka. I took a shot of rum, which I will never do again.

By 2.30, everyone was getting tired and such, so Drew decided that we were going to leave. I was drunk, and I was wearing my stilettos.. which wasn't good. We were watching through Missisauga Surbian streets at around 2.45 in the morning, and I thought there would be no more transit, but there was. And it turned out to be the same bus driver that drove us to her place to begin with, lol! So, we got another free ride, and were back at Drew's before 3, and asleep before 3.30. All in all, it was awesome, though I did miss the Nathan Philip's Square, and going to Golden Griddle at 4 would have been awesome too, lol.

Anyways, that was New Year's...

I've decided that this year, I'm going to buy every issue of Cosmo. Not for the sex tips that could make me a sex master, lol. No, but have you ever noticed that, on the spine of this magazine, there is an image waiting to be pieced together? It's true! I discovered this. Each issue is another piece of this image (which is a male) and when you have all the issues of the year, it'll be a pic of some random guy, lol. Isn't that awesome? And very funny at the exact same time. So, that's my goal. It's much easier than trying to get a transfer for every day of the year, isn't it? Lol.

Yesterday I got my first issue of Cosmo, for January 2007, and Feb 07 should be out in about a week or two, seeing for some stupid reason magazines like to date themselves a month before they come out.. It's weird. I also bought a shirt from Stitches. It's a very pretty shirt, and I like it.

Anyways, I have nothing else to say.. so.. yeah. Yay!

OH!! Drew and I have now been together for 1 year and 3 days. Go us!!! I lovvvve him. &lt;3"

"event","<font color=""#800080"">This hath been a very interesting week. <br /><br />Friday was my last day of high school. It was very depressing but fun at the same time. Me and Willette and Jessica went around drawing potter puppet pals of all the teachers on their boards and taking pictures of it. It made them laugh. :) Afterwards we went to visit Howie in the band room because we didn't get to see him much during band class itself and we drew him a puppet pal and gave him the notes/pictures that Jessica and I have been drawing on the back of our music during band class all year. The three of us spent like the whole last period in the band room just playing the instruments and not wanting to leave band, haha. It was really sad. Jessica even cried when we left the theater. <br /><br />The rest of the weekend was very fire filled. Scott had a fire at his house on Friday and I had the VERY disturbing experience of getting Junebug guts smashed all over my face but other than that it was fun. We played spotlight and stuff. On Saturday I went to Graham's birthday and that was fun too. I can't wait for this Friday to come! </font>"

Friday kind of sucked because I got into my Chem prepublic and sort of had a panic attack. I think I was really psyched out about it with all the stress and whatnot, so I passed it up early unfinished. I know I failed it, but there's not much I can do about it now so I'm just gonna study REALLY hard for the final and hope to bring up my mark. The night was fun though. Scott and I went out to the Holiday Inn w/ Randy (woah, I was just about to type Travis O.o) and Chelsea. After that we went back to Randy's and watched Garden State in his AWESOME theater room. It had a projector and elevated floor and a bajillion movies. It was crazy. I want to have a Pirates marathon in there, or LOTR marathon. <br /><br />On Saturday, we randomly decided to go play tennis, which was sooo much fun. I picked up on it fairly quickly, at least well enough to play, and I spent like three hours there with Travis, Scott and Jessica. After that we went out to Castaways and after our plan to have a fire failed, we went back to my house and watched Scream. On Sunday we played tennis again and basketball and today we played tennis AGAIN. Haha, it has been a very outdoorsy couple of days and I love it. :) <br /><br /></font>"

It was soo busy because I had a prepublic in math, which turned out good cause I got a 72, a MAJOR english assignment due, band tests everyday and now tommorrow I have another prepublc in chem. I'm not as stressed as I was this morning though. I've calmed down quite a bit since then because I came home and just relaxed and remembered that if I don't do well on the prepublic, its not the end of the world. Its funny how much a person can get worked up over ONE test. I gave myself a major headache and everything. I haven't been getting much sleep either due to all the work, so I can't wait till tommorrow when I can come home and take a looooong nap. :) <br /><br /></font>"

It was soo sad though. I actually cried when Davy Jones stabbed Will. However, it wasn't sad at all seeing ten shirtless Jack Sparrow's in the beginning. :) 

This weekend has been a lot of fun. Guys night was awesome, Strikers was a really fun game. I actually scored a couple of goals. For the most part of the night we just hung out and laughed which was nice, because we don't do that much anymore! Today, obviously, was fun too. After the movie we went to Travis' house and watched Borat, which was hilarious! It was disturbing in a lot of parts but it was sooo funny. 

And now I'm sitting at home not wanting to go to bed because that means I have to wake up in the morning, go to tutoring and spend the rest of the day studying my ass off. Sigh, I can't wait for summer."

Everytime something gets on my nerves, I'm like ""Remember, pirates is tommorrow"" and I get happy again :) <br /><br />Ughh, this week has been soo stressful. I hate how everything is always piled on at once. I know I shouldn't care about school so much but I've been really slack these past couple months and it's really starting to show. I know its really my own fault for letting things go for this long but it hasn't really been an easy two months and I'm finding it hard to concentrate. I don't know, I always have something on my mind nowadays and I can't concentrate on anything school related. I used to have a pretty good attention span but now I don't. Oh well, hopefully I do well on my publics and then I'll have ALLL summer to not have to focus on anything. <br /><br />Tonight should be fun! Jessica and I are having a guys night w/ Scott and Travis. Scott and I are going to the West Coast Idol thing and then afterwards we're meeting up with Jessica and Travis and getting pizza/super mario strikers and gaming at my house. Haha, I know it sounds weird that I say Jessica and I are having a ""guys"" night but that's what we used to call ourselves wayy back in the day when we felt left out of the girlies. Its weird, but now that we're actually more accepted into the girlies we miss being the guys. Soo, we're having a guys night just like the good old days! Nothing complicated, just pizza and gaming. <br /><br />I.Can't.Believe.Pirates.Is.Tommorrow.Oh.My.Fucking.God.<br /></font><br />Yes, I am retarded. :)"

"event","This past week has been SO retarded. The day after Grad was when it all started. Me, Jessica and Pat were walking around the mall waiting for my pictures to get developed and for some reason got on the topic of how Scott would react if he found out somebody was pregnant with his child. We all underestimated how he would react, of course, because he ended up acting really maturely which made us feel bad but anyway, on with the story! So yeah, it all started out as a joke and then everything started to add up and we were like ""Woah, maybe we really could convince him."" We started to formulate a plan, thinking that there was no way he would actually believe that we slept together but then Lindsay came up with the idea to get Kelsey to pee on a pregnancy test which was what sold the idea, really. Anyway, there was this one night over Easter when everybody was drinking that we wound up falling asleep in the same bed. Nothing happened, of course, but we managed to make it seem like something did. 

So all that week I acted my ass off. Every single day I had to act like I was actually pregnant. I ate like M&amp;M's mixed with popcorn and crazy shit like that to make it seem like I was having cravings. I also pretended that my period was twelve days late (even though the ironic part is that I had it the whole time) and I was even scaring Jessica at one point. It all built up to the last day which was the day of the big concert at the school. Jessica and I hauled Kelsey out of class and asked her to pee on the stick and it was funny because she was just like ""sure"" without even asking why. So that night we decided to show him while simultaenously saying goodbye to Pat. I couldn't do it though. I felt so bad, I just wanted to tell him it was all a joke and not even show him the test. Chelsea and Jessica took the test and showed him and he got really sad, which made me feel like a terrible person! So we all rushed out and laughed and said we were sorry and he took the whole joke really well. We wouldn't have done it though, if we had not known that he has a really good sense of humour. I must commend him though, he handled the whole thing REALLY well, like way better than a lot of guys would have. 

Either way, it has been the CRAZIEST week. I've never had to act so...pregnant in my life, lol."

"event","The past two weeks have been crazy. Ugghh, wayy too much happened to think about it all right now but I'll try my best to condense the long tales of bandtrip and grad. 

Bandtrip first. It wasn't as good as other years but I still had a lot of fun, despite the circumstances. There was drama, of course, and it revolved around Chelsea, as always. We tried our best to tape everything but in the end we just gave up. All the good stuff kept happening when the camera was off! By the end of it, like right before we got back on the bus to go home Jessica and Chelsea got into a BIG fight. It was hilarious because Jessica was sooo grumpy. I was sad that it was my last bandtrip and it had its ups and downs. We wound up getting gold though, which was cool because Mr. Larade mentioned before we left that he thought we might get silver this year. Our year end concert is this Tuesday and it's my last one! *Tear* 

Grad was a lot of fun too and not nearly as stressful as I thought it would be. It was pretty tiring with the church service and the grand march and all but I found energy somehow (actually with the aid of coffee at 2:30 in the morning, but w/e) for the safe grad. The safe grad by far was the most fun. We stayed all the way through till five and then me, Pat, Scott and Kenneth went to Tim Hortons. I'm not really sure why we went because we were dead (Scott wound up pouring cappacino into my fruit punch stopper without realizing it) but we actually managed to keep on a decent conversation. We had some weird notion that we were going to watch the sunrise though which died as soon as we parked and I had to slap myself to stay awake. I swear if we had stayed there, somebody would have had to come looking for us because there is no way we would have gotten home. Anyway, it was soo much fun but I'm glad all the stress is over now. 

Sweet, I managed to do that in two paragraphs."

"event","There are three OOTP trailers out now! 
I think my head is going to explode if July doesn't hurry up and get here...oh well, at least I have Pirates to keep me going. 

Halifax is in eight days! I can't even think about it, otherwise I'll never get through all the shit I have to do this week. Jessica is staying in an apartment with us now so that should be fun:) It sucks that Larade kicked her out of the apartment though. Last year he let three people stay in a room but w/e, I guess he changed that this year. 

Speaking of Larade, yesterday was very weird. Jessica came over after school because we were planning our EVIL SATANIC plot with regards to Scott and Travis. Jessica called her aunt and found out that Mr. Sutherland had randomly called her so she called him back here and he asked for Mark's blog. We were really confused but I came up to the computer and tried to get into it. Msn was being really stupid, however, so Jessica told Mr. S that we couldn't get in but we would let him know when we did. Then about ten minutes afterwards, Chelsea messaged me and was like ""Uhh, yeah, Mr. Larade just called and asked Danica for Mark's blog."" It was SOOO weird. 

So then Mark himself messaged me and started talking and I asked him for his blog address. It FINALLY worked and there was this entry regarding bandtrip that basically called all of us the ""darkside"" and him the ""light."" It was scary because he called all of us the ""Sith Lords"", lol, and he was the...Jedi? Anyway, I found out today that the ""leaders"" of the ""Sith"" are me, Jessica and Chelsea. I hope Larade does something about him...I really can't tolerate him following me around like he did last year. 

It was also freaky because of the whole Virginia Tech incident...it felt soo much like that kind of a situation, mostly because the teachers were trying to get involved. We'll see what happens I suppose. Overall, it was a very interesting day.

"event","So this weekend was definitely interesting. There is a lot of tension in the air with me and a certain person right now, and surprisingly that person isn't Greg, its somebody else who is being a very crappy friend nowadays. All week we had been planning to hang out on Saturday and randomly she messaged me and was like ""We're not playing car tag tonight or going to Castaways so we can probably do it next weekend instead,"" and that was fine with me because you never know what comes up and stuff. I was disappointed that she cancelled, obviously, but I wasn't mad or anything. 

So instead I went for a walk with Jessica and Scott at Port Harmon, which was really nice. We had originally been planning to run around the track at school but that was too snowy so we walked the length of Port Harmon instead. Afterwards we decided to go to Castaways because we wanted wings and stuff but when we got there Scott pointed out Greg's truck in the parking lot. Jessica was like ""Are you SURE you want to go in?"" and I was like ""Excuse me, I am NOT letting him scare me out getting my wings!"" so we went in. Guess who was sitting there with him? So basically, I got ditched for my ex boyfriend by one of my best friends after having made plans to hang out with her that night. I really don't care about the fact that she was hanging out with him because I'm glad they're still friends and I definitely don't want people to take sides on the issue but I do wish she could have told me about it instead of cancelling plans with me at the last minute in order to hang out with him. I definitely don't want her to hide that from me and at least she could make plans to hang out with him on a night that she hadn't already promised to hang out with me. 

Then today in school she kept bragging about it. All through Chem class she sat there saying ""Ohh my god, I was at his house for like two hours on Saturday and I got dog hair ALL over me!"" or ""I've eaten way too much takeout this weekend, like Castaways on Saturday!"". I just sat there and took it because I really don't hold grudges that easily but in Enterprise she started talking to Seamus about it AGAIN in a really loud voice. It just makes me so mad. I would never do something like that to her. 

Oh well, I guess if she wants to be that way then I'll have to accept it."

I actually had a really good day today for several reasons although I think the main reason is that Mrs. Dwyer gave me a compliment which is always enough to put me in a good mood! She told me that my work on Macbeth was awesome and that if I keep working that way she had no doubt that I could get a 90 on the public. So I'm going to work uber hard to get a 90! Screw math and chem, english is getting the priority this time around. 

This week is very busy though! The enterprise fair is on thursday and I also have a Dracula test that day. I have to rush to finish reading the book in time although since I get Wednesday off of school I don't think it will be too big of a problem. There might be a chem test coming up too, I'm not sure. I'm excited for Wednesday because I have to go into CB for a dentist appointment and mom and I are going to look for a Safe Grad dress. Fun, fun.

All the HP fans are going to hang out and read our favorite parts of the books and discuss what could happen and all that jazz. Then, in the morning, we're going to go down to Walmart REALLY early and wait for the store to open to buy the book. Yay, Harry Potter! 

Its been another drama infused couple of days. On Tuesday night we decided to have another drinking night and Scott wound up getting drunk. It was hilarious. He went into the bathroom at like 1 o'clock and Jessica was like ""I wonder if he locked the door"" so she went up and opened it and gave him a HUGE fright. Then we got in a cheerio (ie, HIV) fight and watched Shrek. As usual, there was Chelsea and Travis drama but overall it was pretty fun. 

I went to Corner Brook with Chelsea yesterday and that was the most fun I've had all week. We went shopping and Chelsea bought a bajillion things. I bought a few things, like a new pair of jeans which were desperately needed and stuff but yeah, then we played lazer tag and I've decided that lazer tag is godly. I sucked ass the first time because I didn't really know how to play but I got the hang of it by the second time. Then we played Vampire which was awesome because its this game where the guy who owns the place dresses up like a Vampire and you have to hunt him in the dark. Its really freaky. I felt like I was in Dracula or something. When we got home, Chelsea and I dumped the body (ie, the beer) and hung out with Meagan for the rest of the night. Overall, it was very relaxing and lots of fun. :)

I can't imagine how much Jessica is going to freak out at Scott, lol. Oh well, we'll just end up laughing about it afterwards, like we always do! 

I stayed here alone last night and it was freaky! I watched Britain's Next Top Model though so that was kinda cool. It's not half as good as ANTM or CNTM, which is saying something because usually Canadian reality tv usually sucks. Their photoshoot was really boring but I guess where it is their first season they're just getting into the swing of things.

Why is it that they always pile on the hard stuff all at once? Our English MLA essay is due on Tuesday and that is always REALLY long and hard to write and then our business plan is due on Monday, which is also really long and hard to write. We also have a math test tommorrow although that's not so bad because I studied ahead of time but Mrs.Skinner also gave us a lab to do for Wednesday. All in all, the number count isn't high but it's the scale of these projects that make them stressful to have all at once!&nbsp;

I've concluded that Two festivals = Scary Larade.&nbsp;

He made me feel so guilty the other day in class. Shauna and I had to play 97 in FOTG alone with the metronome and neither one of us could really play it that well up to speed so he lectured us for what seemed like forever! He told me that the other two first clarinets (both in grade eleven) looked up to me and that I was letting them down because if I couldn't play it they wouldn't want to play it and stuff like that. I felt soo bad. He lectured Jessica very badly the day before too. Sunday was scary because as he gave us a speech, Graham started snickering and he got mad and when they fight it is scary. So yeah, band is also adding to the school stress. I suppose its March though and the end of the year is coming really quickly so its about time that we have to work REALLY hard.&nbsp;

On top of that, I'm expected to have a party for Pat on Saturday. I really want to have the party but this week is just not a good one and I'd feel bad to put it off. Some people are making it more stressful though because they lecture me for not being organized about it and then they don't do anything to help me. I know I shouldn't listen to them, but it kind of takes away the fun when I can't relax about it. Overall, it's just becoming a big stresser and I think I'm going to leave it until my heart is into having it.&nbsp;

Thou art more drama in the mix. I don't know what to do about Ernest and Mark and their asking to hang out with us because they get on EVERYBODY'S nerves, including mine, even though I feel terrible for it. Its like I have Dumbledore on one side saying ""Beee nice!"" and Voldemort on the other side saying ""Be on your crazy bitch side!!"". Erghroar. I want to be nice but they are soo hard to get along with. *Voldemort laughs his high-pitched laugh.*

"event","Today was bad...

Greg and I were driving around getting pictures of things for my enterprise project before band and when I went to pull over we slid on some slush and went off into a ditch. We had to get towed, as we were VERY stuck. It was kind of ironic, actually, because two skidoos pulled over to help us and then one of THEM got stuck and had to get towed by the other one. It was pretty funny. Then when we drove home afterwards, the gears were all fucky and now we have to get the transmission checked out. It could have been much worse, we could have gotten hurt but still! It wasn't very much fun. 

It also seems to me that no matter how much I try to be nice to people, it never really matters because they assume that they can walk all over me. I may be stupid, but not that stupid. I just like to be friends with everyone and one of my friends has a very big problem with that and as a result she treats me like shit nowadays. I think I have the right to be mad at her, even if it doesn't seem like I do because nobody else is around when she does treat me like crap. I'm sorry for being mad about it, but I am.&nbsp; Sigh.

The only problem is when you read so many stories you begin to start assuming that some of the stuff that happened in the fic happened in the real book. It's confusing! I'm reading Dracula instead of the Philosopher's Stone right now and it makes me sad but Dracula is actually getting pretty good now so it's not tooo bad. I'm just going to have to read uber fast to get them all done in time. </font></p><p><font color=""#993366"">Yeah, I have to admit that certain people are really stressing me out lately.

They keep asking/hinting that they want to hang out with us and nobody else wants them to so I don't know what to do. I get really uncomfortable when people put me on the spot and I don't know what to say. I want to help, but I'm not really sure how. </font></p><p><font color=""#993366"">On a lighter note, I have two hundred dollars for the Pat fund and there's definitely another hundred coming that I know of.

I've learned that free time definitely gets boring when everyone is busy and whatnot. I'm not as busy as everyone else this exam time so I'm noticing the difference. Oh well, only two days till Friday and the thing at Chelsea's! 

The party ended up going pretty well. There were a few disasters though, just as I predicted but they definitely did not ruin the night for me. :) Skating was cancelled but we made up for that by going bowling and I accidentally backed into a car at the Dome parking lot in the Beaster but I only grazed the bumper so that was okay. It's not the first time I've done that, lol. It's just so hard to judge your space in a vehicle that long! Plus you can't see because of the pan majigy. So now I get someone to hang out the window and look for me, hahaha. 

I was watching 21 Jump Street last night (what else do I do on my free time nowadays? Haha) and I went downstairs and saw that Holly Robinson was on Oprah! It was like 21 Jump Street karma. They didn't mention her role in 21 Jump Street though. :("

There were parts of it that were fun but for the most part everything was blah and depressing, especially Saturday. Friday was Pat's going away party and I think it's the saddest time she has ever left. Me, Jessica, Greg, Sampson and Mark stayed to her house until one and saying goodbye was soo sad. She really didn't want to leave this time. Then on Saturday we went skating and that was funnest part of the weekend because at first I was holding onto the boards and I could barely walk but by the end of it I skated across with no boards and nobody holding me! Yay! I was so proud of myself and now I want to go again so I can actually learn how to do it. <br /><br />After that we went to Meagan's house and it all started off with Pat calling Meagan and getting upset at her because she had friends over and didn't have time to talk. Everytime Pat leaves she insists that we're having a party because she's gone. Ergh, she's so silly! So yeah, Pat was blah and that was making Meagan unhappy and then Karley found out that the other Jessica was in the hospital. Once we found out that Jessica would be okay, we decided to lighten the mood a bit by having a snowball fight but Travis accidentally hit the neighbor's house and then she freaked out at us too. Overall, a pretty sucky night. <br /><br />So as a result, me and Jessica are going to make our party fun and light-hearted so nobody is depressed or unhappy! Now we just need to find a place to have it. We can have it here, like I said before but with the number of people we want to invite my house isn't very good so yeah. We'll see, but either way there WILL be a party! ^.^ </font></font>"

Johnny Depp is in it and he's like nineteen years old and it's really 80's. There's the corny intro where the words 21 Jump Street are spray painted across the screen and then it breaks like glass. Hehe, very 80's-ish. I love it!!&nbsp;

I'm sooooooooooooo excited for my birthday! Me and Jessica are having a ""joint"" party, hehehe but we don't know where to have it! Because my basement really isn't that big and last year it was really crowded. And Jessica's basement isn't that big either so we have a dilemma. Willette is making a teddy gram cake for us which is really cool because apparently it's like a swimming pool with teddy grams. Yum!&nbsp;

I can't wait for the weekend! Pat is going back though and it sucks because it seems like she's actually home for good now that she has been here for so long and we're back to school and stuff. Still we're having a big party for her before she leaves on Friday so that should be fun but I don't want her to leave! We're going skating on Saturday too and this time around I won't feel so bad because the last time I went skating with friends they were all pro and I wasn't and I had to get Pat and Greg to lead me around the ice. We were at the pond by Graham's house so there were no boards to hang on to! But apparently Travis, Shauna, Chelsea and Emily suck at skating as much as I do so this should be fun because I won't be the only non-pro person!&nbsp;"

I'm going to stop hanging out with Scott and Travis, not because I want to because I love you guys but because it will eliminate any problems that Chelsea or anybody has with this whole hanging out thing. In order to avoid drama it's better just to back off and I have a feeling that if I do this whole problem will be fixed. Chelsea has a problem with Scott and Travis hanging out with me&nbsp;and that's really what all this fighting goes back to. I finally realized today that all this bullshit is because everyone thinks I'm stealing Scott and probably Travis too, or in better words he is ""Stuck up my ass."" Nothing is worth all this shit and I don't really need it so that's it. I have other friends who actually like to hang out with me and don't cause any drama. No matter what I do, nobody is ever happy so I'm going to pull a Sampson and just stay out of it because that's the best way to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a&nbsp;much lighter note, the Christmas vacation was awesome! Christmas day itself sucked but the rest of the vacation was the best I've ever had. New Years was soooo much fun. Well I'm leaving now, Bye!!!!!!!!!</p>"

Chelsea was complaining a lot about how she was bored but I wasn't bored at all. I was just happy that everyone was there and seemed to be in a pretty good mood besides Emily at first because we were stupid and forgot to call her and Scott was blah at the end of the night but yeah, for the most part everyone was happy. I'm not used to Scott being in a bad mood though so he was scaring me a little bit because he's always so happy and laid back and yeah so don't be unhappy Scott, we all love you! <br /><br />I'm excited for today tooo because Jacinda and Jen are coming over and we're all hanging out and exchanging gifts like we did last year on tips eve. Last year was so much fun because we sat on my floor and opened gifts and played poker and then decorated my tree. I'm so glad we're doing it again this year.

I neglected my other LJ to the point where I can't even remember what happened in some of my entries so I figured I'd just start another one. This one will probably get neglected too but oh well, it was something to do on a boring Thursday night in which I left ALL my necessary books in school and therefore was unable to do any work. Muahahahaha. 

So, yeah, the weekend is coming up and I'm kind of excited but not really. I don't know why because there is a lot on the go. Jacinda's having her birthday majig tommorrow. I can't wait to give her my gift!!! I get strangely excited about giving people gifts but especially this gift because it is sooooooooooooo perfect for her! Yes, I get excited about little things. 

Scott has just informed me that we WILL indeed be watching...DUN DUN DUN DUN... a PAY-PER-VIEW MOVIE at his house on Saturday. Should be fun. We never go to his house and I love going to new houses. I guess it's because the scenery never changes in Stephenville so different wallpaper excites me or something. 

I helped Chelsea with clarinet last night and I've decided that I actually want to teach it. Mr. Downey will be proud of me! Jessica and I spent a whole hour in the library making up plans for teaching our instruments the other day and for once I'll actually be making my own money. Yay!

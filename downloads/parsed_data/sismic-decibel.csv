"event","Ok...

Today I went to dads, family dinner thing and we gave him a gift that my sister made for him with our hand prints, basically we reverted back to kindergarten finger painting classes it rocked LOL.&nbsp; So yeah, after that of course we got paint all over our hands so yes, you wash up! We wash up and of course dry your hands! Ah, here comes the twisted part of the story....


Being the only towel in the bathroom at the time we all use it to dry our hands...About 40 minutes pass from that and my step mother who is a clean freak, goes into the bathroom and collects the towel to put in the wash, she remarks to my step sister about it being wet and having visible stains and asks her if her husband ""used"" it, she nods in agreement and then my face goes into shock mode! So I ask her is she sure, she said yes she felt it and saw stains so I freak out and tell her we all used it earlier to dry our hands LOL ( if you dont get it now, the man cummed on the towel in the bathroom, ok the man should have done it in the shower or at least in the sink and wash it out!) Yeah so now I gotta get my baby sister to come wash her hands really well without being totally honest with her about WHY she had to wash her hands, now she is like&nbsp; 13 or 14 (im bad with ages, yeah bad big bro) still a lil sheltered, so we couldn't come right out and say hey Joe decided he needed a wank and used the towel that you dried your hands on as his cum towel, and then decided to return it like nothing ever happened! But we handled that pretty well but anyways...I never met Joe so I was violated by a man I never met! LOL Though I joked with my oldest sister about it, we basically both shared in the jizz of a man! Once in a life time experience I so hope! LOL

I figured a gay guy would have better style sense than that but I was wrong, I guess that harnett county air really did affect him hehe.&nbsp; Now I want to get a chair redone, well Ive been wanting to since I moved here.&nbsp; Its a winged chair which I love for some reason, just hate the material and its all falling apart, but I want to get it redone in a more modern pattern, does anyone know how to redo chairs??? Cuz I sure don't LOL.&nbsp; Im also getting ready to paint I know I know, ive been saying this since I moved here, but yeah I need to choose the colors I want for my living room, bedroom, and bathroom I just need to get down to Lowes or Homo Depot and get every color I can and Just throw them on the floor and stare for hours until I finally choose, maybe I should be locked up in my room sorta like a conclave until I choose the colors LOL.&nbsp; I also need someone to help me put my weight bench together, but that cant happen until my sisters get their mess from upstairs Grrr its a mess up there!&nbsp; Fuck I was just looking at bagel's toys and he has a shitload, I think im gonna throw some out, tho he will notice and be upset LOL that dog is spoiled more than me!&nbsp;"

"event","I had an unique experience, I was manning the sidewalk today for the sale (as I always do cuz I love being outside, and I get to check out all the cute bois LOL) and who walks by with his best friend? JON! omg It was weird, he winked and smiled at me and waved and I smirked and waved back and said hey, first time we have made any sort of communication with each other since the break up, except for his email that hurt/pissed me off. It made me miss him, that sucks Cuz I don't want to miss him, but I do. But I don't think it could work out again, as lonely as I am, I can't hurt again. Then there is Brian, I miss him too, I think I miss the sex tho LOL, it was hot! He moved back to NC in April, and I think he moved back to MN cuz I wouldn't take him back. Honestly, if he had paid me and dad back, and apologized to my family I probably would have taken him back, I know against what all of my friends and family suggested I do, but the heart wants what the heart wants, am I right? YES. But I think my heart was clouded with with the fact that the sex was HOTT! And I miss being with a guy that actually is as wild as I am in the bed. Hmm I'm seriously tired of alot of things here and feel I need a change. I know what one of you is probably thinking, maybe two of you :-P. On another subject, my desktop! Its dying, the hard drive wotn boot alot of the time now, I finally got it up and running an hour ago, after I opened it up and fidgetd with all the connections and blew it (get your minds out of the gutters) it was so dusty, I had a thought that maybe the dust was causing the problems, I don't know only time will tell. Anyway its a perfect excuse for me to get a new computer, maybe a Mac (yeah Will so I can read your away msgs that only you mac users can read, its not fair! :-P) or a Media Edition XP PC for my future home theater. I dunno tough decision, but I wont be buying a new computer for another three or so months, if this one holds out maybe a bit longer. Oh well, thats it im bored now, and need to get ready for bed, at least I can sleep in a lil bit before having to be at work, since I was at work at 730 this morning gawd don't know why, me being the hyper over achiever I can be sometimes LOL..."

don't know what it is about her but seeing her even for a fleeting minute is

But everything that has happened this weekend with Haden being born, made me realize that I had no one special beside me to share the news with. For some reason I expected Jon and I to still be together now, then he fucked up and we aren't. Why do I keep getting selfish guys? Or is it just me? Im starting to think its me. Saturday I was so excited and this thought popped into my head...Justin would be so excited to hear that I'm an uncle. I am excited and happy he is here don't get me wrong. But this has brought out all those feelings I must have pushed aside in order to focus on heather and the baby.&nbsp; Its sad to say I'm used to being alone, but it hurts terribly. Maybe a nice guy will cross my path soon one can hope :-) and hopefully tomorrow will be a better day."

"event","StreetliteBandit [9:49 PM]:  I figure, go around asking girls you might like to make a discordian cabal with you, and you'll weed out the girls who dislike discordianism, though that might not be necessarily bad to the interesting ones, who might be psychotic.   
 plasma illusions [9:49 PM]:  And hopefully they're be hot.

A FEW REASONS:

Big D, I think.
Suburban Legends, "".
Try to pick up some hot (emo?) chicks.  (Except for doing it very badly and making a jerkface out of myself!  WHOO!)
Promote the Aquabats!."

"event","Today, Monty woke up at 7:30 to go to Tusc. to learn how to play the trumpet.  He also rode his bike to the school!  This led to a very tired Monty; though, not right away.  He managed to make noises which aren't shared with those of a dying animal with said instrument.  This pleased Monty, and after an hour and a half passed, he rode his bike home and promptly took a nap!

FIN!

He would also like to note that the Faint is pretty cool."

He woke himself up early to go down to tuscarora to learn how to play the trumpet!  Oh snap!  He can also make noises with it proficiently, but he can't play anything lower than a D.  Ah well, says he!

To sleep he goes!"

 StreetliteBandit [11:07 PM]:  Indeed!   
 plasma illusions [11:07 PM]:  Or blood. 
 plasma illusions [11:08 PM]:  Although blood isn't that bad . . . just not in a cup.

"event","Right, so today is sunday july 3rd.  I just returned from a July 4th party and am currently listening to Lemon Demon searching for the lyric ""And for those sea monkeys who bravely sacrificed their lives for me.""  Caesar was a criminal, but his mother was a saint some say it's subliminial but I say that it ain't.

It seems that young girls think I'm cute.  I kid you not; this six year old didn't stop looking at me and it was unnerving.  Ca-ca-ca-ca-c-creepy.  Either that or I'm hot.  Either way, if you're a six year old reading this, know that, unfortuantely, you have no chance with me.  Sorry.

INTERIM REPORT: My hand taste likes something the dog likes, because I was resting my hand at my side for a bit and he started licking it.

I also talked to a really awesome person I knew on the phone for like 100 minutes and apparently my mom decided to call that specific person my ""snuggle bunny"".  CRAZY.

The thing I will remember most about today is: Tomarrow is July 4th, which is the date of the Aquabats! show."

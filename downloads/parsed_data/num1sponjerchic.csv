"event","OK MY LIFE AS FAR AS I SEE IT IS OK. I MEAN THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I THINK THAT IM GONNA GO CRAZY, BUT IN THE END IM ALWAYS STILL ALIVE. A FEW DAY A GO MY FRIEND WROTE IN HER JOURNAL ABOUT HOW SHE WAS BLAMING ME FOR WHY MY X-BOYFRIEND DIDNT WANT TO TALK TO HER AND HOW HIM AND I ARE ALWAYS TALKIN ON NAPSTER AND ON THE PHONE. SHE BLAMES ME FOR THIS BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME SOMETHING THAT THE TWO OF US AT THE TIME THOUGHT WAS OK FOR ME TO KNOW. THE THING SHE TOLD ME HAD TO DO WITH MY X-BOYFRIEND AND ANOTHER GIRL. UR PROBABLY THINKING TO URSELF RIGHT NOW THAT U KNOW WHAT IM TALKIN ABOUT BUT THE CHANCES OF THAT R SMALL. ANYWAYS ONE DAY I STARTED TALKIN TO MY X ABOUT IT AND I DIDNT KNOW THAT I WASNT SUPPOSED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT. SO WE JUS STARTED TALKIN, AFTERWARD I TOLD MY FRIEND THAT I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT AND SHE DIDNT SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AT THE TIME. THEN A FEW DAY AGO WHEN MY FRIEND ASKED MY X WHY HE WOULDNT TALK TO HER AND STUFF HE SAID BECAUSE U TOLD SKY THAT THING. AND SO SHE BLAMED ME AND WE HAD A FIGHT OVER IT. OH WELLZ. SHE BLAMED IT ON ME AND I THOUGHT IT WAS STUPID BECAUSE IT DIDNT USED TO BE A PROBLEM. ANYWAYS WHOEVER READS THIS I WANT U TO KNOW THAT JUS BECAUSE SHE BLAMES THIS ON ME AND ALL, IM NOT GONNA STOP TALKIN TO MY X. WE'RE FRIENDS AND I DONT WANT TO LOSE MY FRIEND. SPONJERS KICK ASS!
PEACE OUT!"

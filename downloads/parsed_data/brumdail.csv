"event","So yeah, I ended up getting sick again.  It's only been like a month since last time... and this is a sore throat again :-(  After the first day where I really realized I was sick I'm like screw this I'm going to the doctor right away rather than waiting... so I found out I had strep throat and got antibiotics.  Should be fine after that, right?  Well it might just *still* be taking a while for the medicine to kick in, but I went to the doctor and started taking antibiotics on Tuesday.  This is six days later and I still feel kinda crappy although I think I'm almost over it.  So I missed a lot the last week being mostly semi-conscious throwing up having fevers and not really being able to eat :-P

The worst part about the whole thing is I missed what was one of probably not that many chances to see someone who is very special to me.  But oh well, I can't go driving for hours if I can't even sit up :-/  If I'm lucky I will have another opportunity later in the week.

Probably next weekish I'm going to be working full time too.  So yay for money, but bummer for having fun when I need to be at work at 7:30.

Well, I'm gonna go try to eat something and maybe nap... who knows I might be able to be productive today, or at least go outside since it's supposed to be really nice"

"event","So it's getting pretty close to the end of the semester.  It makes me happy that I'm almost done with classes like calculus 2... but I really will miss everyone at Carroll.  This really has been a good year full of some crazy times.  I mean, yeah, there were bad times, but right now I think about all the fun and crazy things that we got away with this year.  You only get one Freshman year, but I think mine was very good.

well... I thought I should list my top 10 memorable things that I did this year at Carroll, but that is kinda hard... so I will do first semester and second semester separately.  And actually it will take me a bit to figure out exactly which events to put down, so I might just put that in a different post.  But you should all think up what you will remember from this year or this semester.

I got distracted making my whole list thing and there was some other stuff I wanted to talk about.  I'm almost done with finals now.  It has been really hectic.  I took two of them today: calc2 at 8 am and my C++ programming at 6 pm.  I should have studied more for both, but oh well.  I'm sure everyone is feeling stressed right about now with finals and moving out and getting ready for summer and all that.  It really helped me that I made a list, prioritized it, and just got that shit done.

Thinking of all the fun times I had so far this semester makes me wonder how the summer will compare.  I am staying on campus during summer session 1 so hopefully I will see a bunch of people who also stay.  I'm worried that it will be like it normally is on break:  everyone goes home and noone is here.  Tonight was the first night that I actually felt lonely in a long time.  I have been so busy with classes or doing stuff with friends or spring fling or whatever... that I just haven't had any down time lately.  Also, I found out that a very good friend of mine is leaving sometime Thursday or Friday.  And to make it worse, there is a good chance that she won't come back to Carroll next year.  I'm sure she is taking it a lot worse than I am, but she knows that we will still keep in touch and hopefully I can go see her in the summer.  I had to go through this last semester with a bunch of cool people leaving, and I don't really want to go through it again.  Also, people are graduating and moving on, and so they will be moving away from Carroll as well.  

I will just really miss these people and I don't know how things will be once they're gone.  I had a really great time this year, and I have so much to look forward to next semester, but I know that it also can't ever be the same.  A lot of my friends are going back to Illinois or wherever.  There's a good chance I won't see them until they come back in the fall.  I just hope that I get into a good routine and don't get bored over the summer with all the work that I'll be doing.

I don't really know where I was going with all that... but if I had this much motivation to finish my fourth paper then it would be done already.  So to everyone still taking tests: good luck on your finals.  For those of you leaving, may you think back of these college years and smile, and for those of you I will be seeing in the summer-- pool party at my place like every day! :-D"

"event","Well, it has been a long time since my last entry.  I'm not sure where to begin exactly.

I am pretty tired from my camping trip over the weekend.  It was pretty cold and it rained during the nights :-(.  It was pretty nice outside during the day, however.  Sure, I missed sleeping in my own bed and the comforts of technology, but I had a fun time and it was a very memorable experience.

It feels soooo good to be an active member now.  I have a lot to look forward to.  It's hard to describe how it feels to finally make it through the pledging process.

I still have a lot of school work left to do.  I need to get caught up in my calculus 2 class.  I also need to do basically half a semester's worth of work in my C++ programming class.  I have to revise one or two papers and finish my final paper for my Eng170 writing seminar... and then I have to prepare for finals.  

I registered for my classes in the web registration.  If I take all the classes that I want, I won't have class until 3 pm or possibly noon on Tuesdays.  This opens up a lot of possibilities for me... like sleep.  I just think this will work out well since I will probably not be getting to bed early, knowing who my future roommates are... and I think we will all have a great time.

Lots of cool stuff coming up... Spring Fling on Friday, possibly DZ formal on Saturday, football game Sunday at 3 pm at Saratoga Park (come watch!) and much, much more...

So until next time..."

"event","So yeah, I should probably update this thing.  Lots has happened, but at the same time, nothing has really changed in a while.  I was sick with tonsilitis for pretty much a whole week, and I've been busy ever since trying to catch up with school and shtuff.  So now I'm trying to finish a 6 page English paper that was due on Thursday, but I got an extension so it's due on Tuesday for me.  But enough complaining...

Happy Easter everyone.  I hope you had a good one.  Mine was.  I went to church and then out for breakfast with my grandparents.  They were really glad that I went with them, and mmm... fresh blueberry pancakes.  I decided that I would be better off napping in the dorms since I was tired and I didn't want any noise and distractions like at home.  Ahh, home, sweet dorm.  I woke up several hours later (I was tired from killing ninjas all night) and then went out to eat for Easter dinner with the family (noone wanted to cook).  More laziness at home and now I'm back in the dorms, and hopefully I can finish all of this homework stuff so I can have fun tomorrow.

More likely I will end up talking to people on the internet and not getting as much done as I would have hoped, but oh well.

Nothing much to report on the drama forecast.  It's been pretty peaceful with noone around, although kinda lonely.

Don't expect an update anytime soon... I'm lazy"

"event","I've been pretty busy lately... with classes, work, and other stuff.  I got to go play paintball on Saturday, which was a lot of fun.  I even took home a few battle wounds... some nice welts on my back and a cool-looking one on my hand.  All in all, it was pretty good.  I really need to get more sleep though, but it's tough with the different stuff I have going on.  I think I'm even going to go take a nap right now, because I just worked for a full eight hours and I think I'm getting sick too :-(  On a brighter note, at least it's warmer outside, and I don't mind the rain."

"event","Well... there are basically two ways I could do this journal.  Either I'm going to post whatever I feel like posting and share everything, or I will only post things that I want other people to read.  Mostly it'll be me rambling anyway, and it's not like it's a big deal anyway.

Well, time to get started I guess.  So, this is a journal... so what's going on in my life?  (this is probably going to be rather lengthy)

As you probably know, I am pledging in the Delta Rho Upsilon Fraternity.  This has been a major part of my life here at school since Wednesday, February 18.  These past 5 weeks have probably been the biggest change since coming to college.  Some people were surprised at my decision to do it, and I guess I can see where they would think that.  I'm not the typical ""frat guy"" and I doubt that I ever will be.  That doesn't mean that I don't like to have fun, and what better group of guys do you know on campus?  I have already had so many good experiences and done things I would not have otherwise.  I wanted to get myself out of my room and experience what college has to offer.  That's why I'm living on campus instead of 7 minutes away at home.  I feel like I'm actually doing something on campus and I have a presence.  Sure, I'm not the same as a member, a fact of which I am reminded constantly, but I still feel more like a part of something.  I had brotherhood and sisterhood last semester.  Those of us on first floor pretty much stuck together.  That all changed once people left.  I doubt it will ever be the same again.  But life means change, and change can be good.  That doesn't mean I don't miss those people though.

Ok that was a rather long paragraph.  I could probably write a whole lot more... if you haven't noticed, I don't usually talk much, but sometimes when you get me started I can talk forever.  I just have to feel comfortable sharing my thoughts.  Well, next part of my life:

School.  Yes, since I am at college I actually focus a lot on academics.  The only class that I really dislike is Calculus 2.  And I dislike it simply because it takes so much time.  I spent 5 hours today just doing stupid assignments... I guess it's my fault since I don't spend much time outside of class on it *every* day... but I probably do 10 hours per week just on homework.  

Coffee class isn't so bad.  Having it every day should make me work on it more than once a week though, right?  Wrong.  I still procrastinate and do it Monday morning.  Occasionally the class is interesting though, and I do learn some things.  The other programming class I usually just sit and surf the internet... since any meaningful programming concepts I have already learned in my other class.  English is meh, but can be fun because of the professor.  Nado is a crazy guy, but at least I'm on the good end of subjective grading.

So yeah, what else is there?  I'm not going to bring up life at home, since I'm not there anyway if I can help it.  Maybe I'll talk about it later.  Everything is pretty much good now anyway.

I thought I'd talk a bit about the situation at hand.  I'm not going to say much because I don't want to dig myself a hole.  I was thinking earlier about this, and I realized that to me it doesn't seem like a new situation really.  It has simply evolved from a long time ago.  I guess what I wanted to say is this:  I have great friends and I care about them a lot.  And neither my involvement in the fraternity nor this situation will change that.  Other than that, I don't know.  But what do I really know about this area, anyway?  I'm pretty sure that everything will work out eventually though, simply because I know who is involved.  Ok... I think that's cryptic enough -- even I don't know exactly what it means.

I thought about talking about other things, but those are in the past, and everything is basically fine now.  Today was a good day.  It actually felt like spring today.  There is a certain smell that you know it's getting to be spring, and it smelled like that today.  I don't know, maybe I'm weird.  But it makes me happy, and I can't wait to do more outside.  Hmm... kickball, basketball, and cherry-cherry sound like fun.  Oh and I'm paintballing this weekend, WOOT!!!

Hmm... what else.  I'm a big computer geek so I *used* to spend a lot of my time online... ok wait I still spend a lot of my time online.  Ok, I used to spend *almost all* of my time online (sad, but true) and at least now I do other stuff sometimes.  I feel like I should go to a MMORPGAA meeting (that's massively multiplayer online role playing game addicts anonymous and I made it up :-p) because it's now the 5-year anniversary of Everquest.  It was cool.  After doing this quest, I got this Staff of Endless Adventures that shoots unlimited fireworks because I've been playing this game forever hehe.  My character name is Brumdail, hence the online pseudonym I use.  It's fun, and I recommend playing if you have nothing to do for 8 hours everyday and you like that sort of thing.  I have been thinking about quitting lately though.  It can just take too much time, and if I only play it every once in a while I wouldn't be able to keep up and I probably wouldn't enjoy it as much.  My brother has been playing since I have been too busy and probably won't be able to play much again for a while.  This has just been a habit in my life for a long time and it's been tough to quit.  I think I'm happier now that I decided I would rather spend time and talk to people or hang out or whatever in real life instead of playing a game.  Sometimes I still have that craving though, and for only $99 I can get another year of EQ!  Although I don't regret doing it, I am not sure that I could invest as much time again.

*looks at clock* Yeah I think that's about enough.  I think I'm beginning to adopt the sleeping habits of these girls I know..."

We are so alike..my sister loves her to death already&nbsp; its crazy..usually she hates my friends but today i think she realized that hell brandi and i look alike and are alike in personality. Chris called me after not having talked to him for whut seemed like forever..he even said i love you before I even thought of it. crazy huh? I got my tongue peirced tis truly awesome...Im sposed to go with nate when he comes back down to get his done...I saw my mom's bestfriend to...she is always the best..she was there when I was born..she truly is my mom number two...and poor ryan her son...wasnt allowed to see his perty lil girl that was there...cause the wench was there with her bf and wouldnt let him see or talk to her. That lil girl is gonna be so burnt...when I saw her she was dragging her feet, and pouty...we think she didnt give her enough to drink. welp for now it is tata. *muah* ~Andriona BRANDI IS HERE YAY.</FONT></EM>"

He was a bad boy and I was a good girl
He needed me to smooth out the edges
He'd get his drink on and flirt with the ladies
After two years of his crap I quit begging 
I'm a magnet for the fixer upper man
If I know it's fire, why do I let it burn my hand

(Chourus)

Cupid works for the devil
Be suspicious if he cries
You know sex is usually good
Yeah, but it ain't always right
Chocolate is a band-aid and no matter what they say
Shoes don't stretch and men don't change

My friend Lisa, she loves a liar
She found about his other girlfriends
He makes excuses so she forgives him
She swears she's gonna leave if he screws up again
But he's good looking, that's why she don't see
He's got her exactly where he wants her to be


(Repeat Chorus)


I just met a brand new guy
So far so good
iIhope he don't change at all

(Repeat Chorus)

I found myself wrong again
Starin out my window
Wonderin what it is I should have said
I found myself at home again
Waitin for the after call
From a fallout that feels like such a mess

Ohhhh I can only be myself
I'm sorry that's hell for you
Heyyy so what's my damage today
Don't let me get in your way
Let it out like you always do
The trouble between me and you
Is nothing new

So I listen to you complain and then
I bite my tongue in vain again
As I let it all just slowly settle in
Such a pretty picture that you paint
I'm so vile while your a saint
Funny how your eyes see thick not thin

Ohhhh I can only be myself
Your lookin for someone else
Heyyy so what's my damage today
Don't let me get in your way
Let it out like you always do
The trouble between me and you
Is nothing new

You know how to give it but you can't take it
It's all just a waste now you can save it
No matter what I do
Is never good enough, never good enough

Heyyy so what's my damage today
Don't let me get in your way
Let it out like you always do
The trouble between me and you
Is nothing new
Is nothing new

Save your breath cause here comes the truth
I'm over the drama of you
And that's something new

Well I'm starin' out my window
Wonderin' what it is I should have, said


Unreachable 

Just like an angel, you're gonna make me fly
Into your arms, you're wrapping me up so tight

You had me crawlin so bad
Had me heels over head
You got me easy, you got me easy
Tangled up in my head
Quit trying to hold and to help me
Cuz we're already beautiful

So dont make me cry
Cuz this love dont feel so right
You cant push a river
You cant make me fall
But you can make me unreachable

I may be sweet, but im still on the vine
You couldnt wait, no you had to take your bite

You had me crawlin so bad
Had me heels over head
You had me easy, you had me easy
Too late to go back
To realize what we had
We were already beautiful

So dont make me cry
Cuz this love dont feel so right
You cant push a river
You cant make me fall
but you can make me unreachable

Sometimes love is addiction
Sometimes it hurts like hell 
And sometimes you just cannot get enough
You can't make me love you,
Any more than i do
But you can make me unreachable

Dont make me cry
Cuz this love dont feel right
You cant push a river
You cant make me fall
But you can make me
So dont make me cry
Cuz this love dont feel so right
You cant push a river
You cant make me fall
But you can make me unreachable"

I'm really bored, it's getting late.
What happened to my Saturday?
Monday's coming, the day I hate.

Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

This is when I start to bite my nails.
And clean my room when all else fails.
I think it's time for me to bail.
This point of view is getting stale.

Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.

You held my hand and walked me home I know
While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love 
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? 
The one who gives it all away

[Chorus:]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget 
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset 
Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who, throws it all away

[Chorus]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry? 
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

[Chorus]
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Better off that way 
I'm better off alone anyway"

"event","Think about this... You may not realize it, but it's 100% true. 

1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would 
die for you. 
2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way. 
3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they 
want to be just like you. 
4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if 
they don't like you. 
5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep. 
6. You mean the world to someone. 
7. If not for you, someone may not be living. 
8. You are special and unique. 
9. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you. 
10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes 
from it. 
11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a 
look: you most likely turned your back on the world. 
12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you 
want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, 
probably, 
sooner or later, you will get it. 
13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget 
about the rude remarks. 
14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will 
feel much better when they know. 
15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that 
they are great."

BUT said that if i got in the car with luke he would kick both our asses.. so yea.. now im home bein pist!! O but soemthing funny was found out by me today! i saw dana at registration and she asked me what was goin on between me and luke and explained that clarissa is fucking pist and that everytime she goes past tastee twist she flips it off, and she said brianna told her that usually when im workin luke comes and see me, and dana said something about luke tellin clarissa that he loves her and wants her back..but i dont know how or when and this couldnt have been recent because all hes been doin is working... OOO and my favorite was clarissa said that if i give clarissa the ""wrong look"" that shes going to beat my ass... WOW is all i have to say.. i dont really understand why shes sayin all this i mean its just a guy for crying out loud! ugh,, i just think its funny how shes all blowin up about it i guess it shows that we really arent that great of friends anymore but hey what can ya do? im just gunna laugh because i think that it is hilarious!!! but i am still really pist.. lets not forget that.. but yea.. im outie.. loveya now bye"

1. Get boxes of condoms & put them in peoples' carts when they aren't looking. 
2. Make a trail of orange juice on the floor to the restrooms. 
3. Walk up to an employee and announce in an official tone, ""I think we have a code 3 in housewares,"" and see what happens. 
4. Put some M&M's on lay away. 
5. Set up a tent in the camping department, tell others you'll only invite them in if they bring pillows from the bedding department. 
6. Look right into the security camera and use it as a mirror while you pick your nose. 
7. Dart around suspiciously while humming the theme from 'Mission Impossible.' 
8. While handling guns in the hunting department ask the clerk if he knows where the anti-depressants are. 
9. In the auto department practice your Madonna look using different size funnels.

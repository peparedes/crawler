<b>DO:</b>
- Add me first and drop a comment.  If you don't do both, you won't be added.
- Have at least three interests in common with me.
- Take a general interest in my life by commenting on one in three entries.
- Type like a literate human.  Using exessive puntucation, constant abbreviations, etc, are a good way to make me irritated.

<b>DON'T:</b>
- Update a million times a day with no point.  Excellent way to get ZERO comments back from me.
- Be a comment whore.  Only comment if you actually have something to contribute.


To me, being friends is a mutual thing.  Leave comments on mine and I'll leave comments on yours.  I hope we can get to know each other!  ^^"

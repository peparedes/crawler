"event","I don't know what was bothering me for so long but I thnk it may be on how bored I am is how wild my mind will run, when there is nothing in my life I feel like the little I do have is just going to disapear along with everything else I dont even know if that makes sense..

 I don't want to be ""that"" girl anymore who sits in the corner bitting her nails so that she has a reason to nit lokk up and make eye contatct with anyone, she didn't cut it. I can not be that anymore I will not!

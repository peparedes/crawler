Ive done good things since last updating ages/ millenia ago

I have conquered my fear of public speaking to an extent
I have gained self confidence and some self worth (woot)
I have grown as a human being in a world full of idiotic selfish bastards!
I have also colored my hair and lost weight woot for me!

I shall be strong and i will say this boldly
forever into the minds of those i love and loathe...
you will know of my pain and my problems
my angst is forever held true
not to be taken lightly anymore
no more shall jessi be trodden on
taken advantage of
pushed around
or yelled at by bitches who have no authority
not to be told what to do by those who do not matter in my life
I will seek revenge upon those who have hurt me
those who have pained me in some way
attacking them in their sleep
when i die i will be free of them all.....

that is my life story written out it is the new prophecy of my path.... join me and be nice or die on the outskirts of mere reality"

"event","Passing by the shattered glass
Of what her life used to be
She saw so much change
Her attitude changed from that of a depressed child
To one of a person who has no fears or anger
She hadn't noticed the one thing that stood in her way
They were against them every day
So she stood up tall and swept the glass away
And yelled so loud that everyone could hear
She yelled You cant keep me down anymore, 
Im coming out a new person
And with that she began to see her life more clearly
That she didnt suck, her mental breakdowns didnt help her any
And that she could love herself without anger or fear"

shattered dreams upon the untread ground
Lives affected by those who suck
lives torn to shreds because no-one cares about the one who needs help
doing whatever the hell they want
to further their own asses
care about the people who need you most
for they may be falling deeper and deeper to self hatred and rejection
it is too late for me but help others
see the lightand follow it to the end
help the world
dont make me force you into the light!

Pray for them as if they will never live again
Even if it only lasts but a day pray for them
You could be the one thing saving them from eternal damnation
You could rescue them from something horrible
But then again who really takes their own time to do good for others?
I know of nobody who does that
Not one single person who really truly wants to help others
Actually only one person
They are good inside and out.
Be like them and help others

People only care about how you look
If you aren't perfect you arent their friend
Menacing Mistress perfection is
Its all about how you act and how you look
If you arent a size zero you are nothing
If you arent popular people want you murdered
If you are a little different people hate you
Why can't people accept everyone for who they are
If you don't love people for who they are you suck
If you are skinny and say you are fat
YOU NEED HELP
If you are so anal to want to be skinnier 
GET MORE HELP
Don't try to be perfect... 
Only barbie is and shes fake
Grade A bullshit
What every person wants to be is skinny....
Load of shit in my opinion
Dont try to be something you cant be, just be yourself
People love originality....

Go away
Let me be
I do not wish to see you here anymore
You are the reason for my problems
I hate you
I fear for you
I cry over you
I fall over dying in your arms
This is my undoing
Your cause and effect on me has led to deadly consequences
I won't let you topple my happiness
My happiness means to little to you
Yet your happiness means the world to me
I'd be willing to give up everything
Just so you won't ever be sad
So you won't ever feel pain 
So you won't ever cry
Yet you don't give a shit about what I feel.
When will you learn?
When will you care?
When will you love me for me?
When will you see the destructive person you've become to me?

wow i wrote that whole thing in 5-10 minutes... i could get another out... i love that poem!



Another one, no name


You looked right through me
As if I was air
You messed with my emotions
You act so horrible to me
Yet I still love you no matter what you do to me
Maybe I am naive, or stupid but that can't change my emotions
You are always around yet you arent really there for me
You walk right by me without a second glance
I wave to get your attention
Yet you don't notice
I scream your name yet you still don't hear me
When will you learn I will always be trying to grab your attention?
I'll be there for you through thick and thin.
Sadness and sorrow.
Love and Hate.
You never knew this but you are my shining light, 
My light at the end of the tunnel,
My shining light to guide me through everything,
When my world is falling I turn to you for guidance
For support and help yet you do not care
How would it feel for me to not care for you?
I bet you wouldnt even notice anything.
I'll continue on as if you are all that matters to me!

well i squeezed two out of my lovely brain of unwritten poetry...."

Pulled away from the darkness
Back to the light where good things live
Finally noticed by those who ignore many and love few
Happy for once
Sadness need not apply
Acceptance from the world of happiness
Rejected from the world of sadness
Finally seen by the people.


Ouch

Banging metal to metal
One thing being dented the other still strong
Ironic it is the flag not the trumpet
The trumpets side is dented because they were too close
Ouch they got hit in the side
Pain occurs all over
Falling down
YAY!!!
First hit of the year
They learned to go to their spot
That day of doom and destruction.

They see the rejction from past and present loved ones
They show little to no compassion for the hurt one
She cries when nobody watches
Screams when shes alone
Wanting, Praying, Hoping to be noticed and loved for herself
Always helping others before her own self
Forgetting her own needs
Wanting others to succeed more
Hoping for recognition.... it never comes 
Yet she waits, ever hopeful someone will hear her plea
One day she will die from loving others yet not being loved enough 
Nobody will miss her she will rot underground
unhappy, unloved, and truly betrayed.

i just realized how gullable and idiotic i can be when someone I know and trust a lot lies to me.... i bet everyone is lying to me soo much that i dont even realize it, someone can tell me one thing and then i read something else that states something else, this my friends is in truth the ultimate horrible thing.... to be lied to for most of my life..... which i am going to stop thinking about now because well ive had too many bad things happen to me and i have a punching bag in my room and i will use it and use it a lot when something bad like being lied to or losing something big like a competition, or if someone hurts me badly........ well im done

"event","blech, how can the best day of my life be the worst all in one????? i learned i made banners, thats good, i also learned i didnt make weapons, which is bad and i still DONT believe that so until the ugly cheese god sings or arther tells me himself i didnt make it then i wont listen to anyone, also i learned the banner routine from heidi and some of the flag stuff but not much.

oh heres what happened when i went to heidis--- well we decided she should teach me banner stuff BUT we had no banners so we airbannered it for a while then we thought HMMMM since NOBODY AT ALL brought back the practice banners we should create our own from wood so we attempted one prototype, lets say that didnt work so me, heidi and her mom went to home depo got some wood got it cut then got some handles went back to her house got some holes and put the handles (long story short her brothers a complete idiot and he wrecked one handle that I yes I fixed and its working on my 'banner') we tightened them sanded em down so they were smooth as a donkeys fur/hair and we practiced with em all in all it took us MORE than 5 hours and at least 3 trips to some hardware store randomly to get what we needed........ yea but hey i have one now....


me and my brother apparantly switched our wall units while i was out so my mom found a few of my things i had hidden from her.... so i attempted to make it work... i failed as always so the 28 and 1/2th try will work which will be once i acquire a new daybed for that dreaded area called a bedroom its more of a mini black hole that doesnt even need to be there! oh well once i get a new bed and can move some shtuff about it will be fine....

nothing tomorrow except ""cleaning"" my room hence i actually may clean it!

well im done bye soryr if its kinda long its been a stressful day for me

It annoyed me a lot and i just hammered it apart and it got rid of my anger for it and other things away, of course bringing all the big pieces down the stairs was another obstacle that i mastered wonderfully! so now i have a mattress on the floor with all my pillows and such on top! wonderful i say just wonderful.... a day bed is soon to enter that room of smallness. i have a fondu set and really awesome mugs and vintage bowls away in my 'hope chest' as my parents called it i also have some really neat glass and gold cups and these things you put wine in and then pour it out of.... me and my brother are switching our wall units soon my annoying one for his cool one thats super tall and has glass and wood not just wood... sadly i cant hide anything in mine anymore but oh well ill figure something out. im getting tons of material from my mom and a on of other small useless items that ill use in band like a fan with a water squirty thing.... i am possibly giving away a ton of kids videos to my best friend for her nephew, if she doesnt want some ill probably either donate em or sell em for a small amount of money to anyone who wants some. my brother took the good ones but he really only took teenage mutant ninja turtles, thats his thing i dunno why he wants em but he wanted them so good for him. i just took chip n dale and micky ones donald duck too.... were not close to being done with the garage stuff but we'll finish it sooner or later... as will on big brother 5 said as karmas a boomerang ill see you sooner than later something like that...


breaking that long thing up now... fitting at 11 tomorrow fun i did find my shoes happy about that.... they smell weird cause they were in a bag with an air freshener ooh and i am going to get some red or something highlights in my hair ill save fun colors for when im not in guard (maybe sooner than i think, guards expensive and my family doesnt have much money so due to that i may quit and do something at the college) im not doing as much curricular stuff as i wanted to a few years ago... i wanted honors english and i didnt get it (sad face inserted here) french not spanish because i can learn spanish ANYTIME.... plus i dont talk to people who speak spanish and i wont work in a place where i have to know... plus spanish seems boring and i dont need 2 years to graduate so there (enter sticking tongue out here) you only need more than 3 to go to a 4 year and i can do sign language at college if i decide that.... which i doubt i will howd i get here i dont know well gotta go bye"

well i am dismanteling my bed tomorrow however i am allowed to do it... missing friday band camp because i have to help clean out the garage but i am going next week and working doubly doubly triplicy hard to catch up and not get yelled at by many people.... key note many hehe im gonna work super hard to learn everything that may have been taught and i WILL remember it this year unlike last year when i got a touch overwhelmed... anyway moving on..... i hold the excessively highest respect for anyone who can do gymnastics.... it looks fun yet a bit hard not too hard though......

i am done being stressed out i need a new hobby sewing it is then.... i have an obsession with making pillows.... yes i am weird with stuff like that!

strange that in 3rd grade i was sooo outgoing then i sorta introverted myself... oh well thats bad choices on my part for ya.... probably just the people who i chose to be friends/enemies with... i dunno my mind got messed up somewhere in my life, probably around quitting dance and hating cheerleaders cause they hated me... i dunno somethin occured with my self esteem which caused major schloooopa! schloooopa is my new word.... i dont understand what it means yet...


schloooopa is my new copyrighted word use it and i attack you with a spoon! it means the act of decrease or going down... or eating cheese in the middle of may on friday the thirteenth while chewing gum and wearing a cowboy boot and a sock... with a ninja mask on! and full body armor..."

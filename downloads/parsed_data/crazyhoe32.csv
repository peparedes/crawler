Jen and Taryn met up with me, Scott, and Timmy at Dunkin Doughnuts. Yeah.....Scott and Timmy made us all laugh as usaull. Sunday, Timmy hung out at my house all day. Me and him watched The Saw and Goofy movie. Yep....he actaully watched goofy movie with me(I know he didnt want too). Then we played Egyptian Rat Fuck, and I beat his ass!!!! Also Sunday Ryan and Beanie stopped by b/c he picked her up!! I am sooo fucking happy that i saw my beanie, even tho i only saw her for like 10 minutes. Later on that night i went over Helen's and slept over. It was madd fun like it always is there. Now today I am bored out of my mind. Thinking about goin to CJ's b/c he invited me over.

When u care about somebody soo much and think that they r ur really good friend and u dont even get a phone call from them. Not even on ur birthday. Or when u r upset and they r there but they dont take the time to see if u r ok, b/c they are to busy trying to hook up with other people. Or how about when they say they miss u sooo much and then when they finally come up here to visit, they dont even take the time to see u. Wow!! I saw u once when u were up for like 5 mins and it was by chance too. It wasnt even planned. I guess some people will never just feel the same way u do about them, not even boyfriend/girlfriend wise but friend wise too.

Pami and Ryan stopped by which was good seeing them. After work I went home and Jen was supposed to help me make a myspace account but we never got to it for some reason. Now I am bored out of my mind. Its 4:10am and I aint tired b/c I slept soo late today. Man, good thing I dont have to be into work until 5 tomorrow. But yeah, I am goin to go and try to find something else to do, so Love Peace Chicken Grease."

Saturday I didnt have to work b/c it was rainging and DQ was dead. Beanie slept over that night and me and her got really drunk. Hehe!!! Madsd fun. I was happy I just got to spend time with her by myself. Just me and her alone havent hung out in a while. Yesterday was a busy day. Me and my sis drove home beanie with ryan, and then we met up with cj and jay to go to Brad's party. It was really fun. Now me, Jen, CJ, and Jay r all at Scott's house. We went here after the party. I got no sleep and I have to go to work tomorrow at 12. Wonderful!!! We a had a really good time. We were playing truth or dare and strip poker which Jay killed us all in. We also played ""I never"" and ended up gettin into sex stories and what not. It is good though that u could feel comfortable telling that shit to your friends and stuff. Well eveyone elase is sleeping except for me and CJ and I got to get of so CJ can go on b/c we are bored as hell and there isnt even anywhere for us to sleep!!!

"event","Yeah, so as all of you know today was my birthday. I am glad everyone made it a special day. Ryan had told me that he wanted to hang out with me after school so ha can give me my other present and I said ""sure!"". So at the end of the day when he came to pick me up, he told me that my present was in the backseat of his car. So when I looked in the backseat, I saw Beanie laying down, hiding. I was sooooo fucking happy. That was the greatest birthday present of all. I love you Ryan, for doing that. That was awesome. We had fun just basically chiiling, and talking and shit. I wanted Beanie to sleep over b/c my parents actually said yes for someone sleeping over on a school night, but her mom wanted her home, so once again I had to say good bye. I am probably going to see her Saturday though b/c she is sleeping over! YAH!!!

I still have Bio homework to do but my mom said I can go in late tomorrow so I have all the time in the world. After school tomorrow, I am getting my belly button peirced I think,(and Keesh if you want to come with me you can). It is a part of my birthday present, along with 200.00. Man I love my parents sooo much. I'll admit it, they spiol me. Also now that I am 16 I am going for my permit this week sometime. I can't wait till I drive. I will be picking up Keisha all the time and be going to see Beanie, and anyone else who needs a ride could just give me a call. Even though most of you are older and will probably have your liscense before me. Well I think that is enough!! So Peace."

"event","Hey guys. What's up. I haven't really been doin much lately, just working really, but I did have a really fun weekend though. Saturday was Harry's birthday so me, Jen, Vinny, and Beanie all went to his aunts house to celebrate. It was soooo much fun!!! I love Harry's family tooo. They are sooo cool. His little sister and her friend and cousins LOVED me, Jen, and Beanie and wouldn't leave us alone. As soon as we got there we all gave each other make overs. It was soo funny. I felt like I was like 8 years old at a slumber party. Harry's cousin Mikey definetly wanted to get down my pants. Apparently Monday we were supposed to get married, while that is what he told my sister. I love him though. He is sooo funny. He also tricked me!!!! He asked me to give him a kiss on the cheek, so as I was going to do it, he turned his head and kissed me on the lips. What an ass!!! We went quading too. I went a few times. It was my first time and it is so much fun!! We also got pretty drunk, so that is always a good thing. We slept over his aunt's house and had to wake up madd early b/c Jen had to go to work. I only got like 2 hours of sleep. When we got home, me Beanie, and Vinny made a shit load of food.They left soon after and a took a nap to get as much sleep as I could before I went to work. Work was hectic. I worked with Lauren and Scott and some lady there flushed her keys down our toliet. HaHa!!! What a dumb bitch!!! Also before she left, her fucking kid shit on our floor. We were alll wondering what smelt sooo fucking bad and then a customer finally told us that there was shit on our floor. Scott had to clean it up. Man I felt bad for him. He was soo pissed. After work, me, Jen, and Timmy, spent the night at Scott's. (For those of u who don't know, Harry know lives with Scott). CJ and Jay were there too until like 3:00 in the morning. It was fun hanging out with all of them. The next day I went into work but then left b/c my eye was all red. I went to the doctor and aparently I got dirt in my eye from the quads and now I have a major infection in my eye. It sucks. I can't wear my contact lens for two weeks and I can't see  out of my eye. I had the last few days off and basically hung out with Beanie and Vinny and knoe I have to go back to work tomorrow."

You are sensitive to your partner's needs and view your time with them as precious. You like to take your time, and your favorite way to kiss is tenderly.

All I got to say is that somebody please tell me that they have 5th per. lunch, b/c I don't know anybody in my lunch and I don't want to be walking around the cafe having nobody to sit with. I really don't want school to start in the first place. The summmer was great not having any asswholes and shit to deal with. 

Anyways, today was my only day off and I slept till 2, and then Beanie came over. We called up Ryan and he picked us up and we all hung out. When we got home, me, Beanie and my mom all watched Sin City. I love that movie. My mom thought it was madd weird and she fell asleep through most of it. KNow it is about 3:45 and I got to wake up at 9:oo to get some McDonalds breakfast.  We were watching Big Daddy and know I really want some Mikky D's breakfast know."

"event","So, I went to go see Red Eye last night with Beanie, Vinny, Jen, Jazzy, Sami, and Bryan. It was a good movie and let me tell you Cilian Murphy is sooooooo fucking hot. As a matter a fact, I am tired of seeing everyone else writing how hot he is, b/c you know what bitches.....he's mine! I saw him first, so back off. Before we saw it, me, Jen, Beanie, and Vinny went to go drive Harry home. Car rides are always fun with us five. On the way back Vinny was supposobly pulling out toy cars out of Jen's back seat. It was soo funny. I went to work today, and I am working like a mexican the rest of the week. The only day I have off the whole week is thursday. I am even working Friday night which I am really pissed about b/c I haven't been to the mall in like two weeks, and that new rule for the mall is coming out Sept. 9. So I wanted to go as much as I could. Speaking about Sept. 9th, ya know how I was supposed to have my party that day, well it turns out I'm not, so can you guys PLEASE do me a favor and tell everyone that I am not having it, since I won't be at the mall Friday. Thanx!!! It would be great if you guys could do that b/c I don't want people showing up at my door."

"event","Well, I got home from Ocean City yesterday, and then had to work, and I worked today, and I am working tomorrow too. I guess vacation time is over. I miss Ocean City already. It was sooo much fun.I hung out by the beach every day and went in the ocean, and got knocked the fuck out by a few waves. I think it is the funniest shit when I get knocked out. My sis makes fun of me b/c she would hear me laughing under water. I got color but the thing that sux about that is my face is peeling now, and it looks sooo nasty. While I was at OC, me, Jen, Sami, Bryan, Mike, and Dena drank every night, as u can see in Sami's pics. We were drunk in like most of them. The past that sucked about Ocean City was that there was this kid there who wouldn't leave me alone. He would like follow me and he kept on saying that I was like the perfect girl. What the fuck ever yo. I hope I NEVER see him again. I might b/c he lives around here. Fucking asswhole. There was this other guy though named Pat that was really cute. Him in his mom came with us this year. His mom worked at our school. Her name was Mrs. Heart. I love her. She is soo nice. (For those of you who don't know:we go on vacation with like 10 different families.) Well anyway, I was starting to like him but then I saw him with these two hoes one night, and he also asked this other girl out on a date. So I was like ""Fuck that!!!"" I might see him at school and he works at Media Play so when I see him again I will say hi and we will see what happens. Overalll I had a kick ass time and I want to go back soooooooooooooooo badly. I did miss you guys though, and I will probably see you all at the mall and shit."

In your<br>life you have probably been hurt many times and<br>have gotten some mental scars. This results in<br>you being distant from people. Though many<br>think that you are evil, you are not. What you<br>really are is a person, trying to forget your<br>pain and past. You are the person who never<br>seems to care and that is why being an assassin<br>fits you good. Atleast, that's what people<br>think. Even if you don't care that much for<br>your victims, you still have the ability to<br>care and to generally feel. It is not lost,<br>just a little forgotten. In crowds you tend to<br>not get to noticed, and dress in black or other<br>discrete colours. You don't being in the<br>spotlight and wish people would just leave you<br>alone. But once you do get close to someone you<br>have a hard time letting go and get real down<br>if you loose him/her.<br><br><b>Main weapon:</b> Sniper<br><b>Quote:</b> ""The walls we build around<br>us to keep out the sadness also keep out the<br>joy"" -Jim Rohn<br><b>Facial expression:</b> Narrowed eyes

"event","As we grow up, we learn that the one person that wasn't suppose to ever let you down probably will.  You will have your heart broken probably more than once and it's harder every time.  You will break hearts too.  So remember how it felt when yours was broken.  You'll fight with your best friend.  You'll blame a new love for things an old one did.  You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually loose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh to much, and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you have denied yourself and can never get back."

I have been debating whether or not the opposite sex can remain strictly friends throughout there entire relationship.  I've been discussing this with a few of my close friends and we seem to agree that if both like the opposite sex then at one point or another one or both feel an attraction and are jealous of the others relationships.  It may just be a matter of not acting on it because the whole brother sister feeling is well just to weird for either to look past.  In the end though you may find out that your silly next door neighbor or very best guy/girl friend turns out to be the love of your life.  So I feel it is best to go with your heart and your gut feeling.  If things don't work out then ok things are a little weird for a bit but a strong friendship will surpass just about anything life throws their way.  In my opinion I'd rather react on a gut instinct and be wrong then live the rest of my life with uncertainty.

Best of luck out there to everyone who listens to their hearts even when their brain is screaming ""Are you nuts!!!!""

I'd rather be hated on for being too emotional then being heartless any day of the week!!!!

I'm a lover not a hater :)"

"event","Many of us go through a faze in life where we are just stuck in limbo.  Unsure of exactly what we want to do with the rest of our lives.  Knowing that we want to be happy and successful we constantly change our minds.

Thank you to all who have faith in me.  I love you so much and I will make you proud!!!! :)"

  As a female you generally have a few good friends that you consider very close to you.  Each of these friends share an important role in your life.  You have the friend to shop  with, the friend to cry with, the friend to party with and laugh, and the friend to have in-dept conversations with.  However there is always an exception to the rule and if you are as lucky as I am some of those great things are rolled into one person.

  Then you have that one special friend that is truly your best friend in life.  The one you tell everything to without a second thought.  They are the type of friend to have your back even when they know you are wrong.  You laugh with them and cry over joy and sorrow.  You have that bond that is unbreakable even though at times in your life that bond is tested.  In the end you remain strong even if life separates you many miles from one another.

I love you boo and always will!!!! :)  1 more wk. till you visit!!!!"

I know in my heart that you cannot change the past.  What is done is done and there is no going back.  So we should live in the present and strive for the future."

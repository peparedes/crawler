"event","not that anyone cares.... here we go! 5 in one entry? why not!<br /><br /><strong>Day 06 &ndash; Your day, in great detail</strong><br /><br />I woke up at around seven thirty- brushed my teeth, had a shower, ate yogurt/granola, watched veronica mars. Left my house at 8:40 and walked to work... got there about ten minutes early so I read a magazine until 9:30... then I worked. I did some organizing, a colour order, booked some appointments... dusted... very exciting. My manager's getting married in a few weeks and will be away from the salon for two weeks. For whatever reason, it's been decided that I am her stand-in... so we talked about that... and I get to go to the Aveda holiday launch party with my boss... so that's exciting because I get to dress up and then have an awkward evening of mingling with salon owners at a very nice restaurant. I have never been to a work event that wasn't just my coworkers, so I am intrigued. Anyway, so I worked untill 5:30 and then I walked home... and when I walk home I walk through a pretty sketchy area, which is also the only area where people in this city find me a suitable dating partner. Met a guy who just moved here from Toronto and says it's not very fun because there is no marineworld or wonderland? I asked him if that's what he did all the time in Toronto and he said yes. And then he insulted the Calgary Tower. Needless to say, very incompatible. Not to mention the fact that he is likely a drug dealer???? Hate to generalize. Anyway the rest of my walk was uneventful, drank an iced coffee and listened to cbc radio 3 the breakfast club podcast. I've now been home for about a half hour... tonight I will probably go to a techno show and watch people dance like lunatics.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Day 07 &ndash; Your best friend, in great detail</strong><br /><br />Well I'm a grownup so I don't say best friend anymore. But I guess the friend I am around most is Marcella and she is slightly taller than me with dark brown hair and brown eyes. She's pretty fun I guess. I don't know what to say!!! She loves techno music and 80s metal... and wearing shirts off of her shoulder. Because of her, I feel as though my life resembles the eighties more than any other decade.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Day 08 &ndash; A moment, in great detail</strong><br /><br />Oh my god!!! What moment? Got new glasses and man they are headache inducing... i feel as though i'm wobbling everywhere in them. that's a moment i guess. glasses shopping is the worst- nothing looks good.... too wide, too narrow, too big at the nose, curve up at the side, ugly handles, etc etc etc. then you get paranoid and realize that not even the glasses you've been wearing every day for two years look good!!! what are you supposed to do?<br /><br /><strong>Day 09 &ndash; Your beliefs, in great detail</strong><br /><br />i believe that if every person could feel healthy, be happy, and feel whole that there would be no fights. i also believe that some of these goals can be achieved differently depending on the individual. this is the great benefit of religion- helps people feel whole. i'm not religious and i have a hard time, but also can't get behind most religions for myself. something is going on on planet earth and i'm not loving it. i wish that instead of fighting wars, designing new novelty food products (even though i love them)&nbsp;and focusing on what is wrong with ourselves (and this is what most of my brain energy is dedicated to) that we could focus on lifting everyone up. change the way food is viewed/sold/made, love ourselves, have patience, understanding and gratitude and feel balanced... instead people focus on tearing others down.<br /><br />basically these beliefs are the things that will change/improve <strong>my </strong>life, and i think the root of many common problems today. ahhhh utopia!!!<br /><br /><strong>Day 10 &ndash; What you wore today, in great detail</strong><br />I am wearing an ill-fitting nude bra, a blue tri-blend american apparel v-neck, red bikini underwear, black levis, black toms, and my glasses. when i was outside i was also wearing a navy blue american apparel hoodie and a red flannel jacket. it is a boring outfit, but also super flattering, as my least favourite coworker told me i look as though i am withering away. trust, she meant it as a compliment.&nbsp;"

"event","<strong>Day 05 &ndash; Your definition of love, in great detail</strong><br /><br />love seems to be this magical healing tool that will fix your life because every night someone is cuddling you and there is someone that legitimately cares about how your day was and wants you to be happy, and in return you want to do everything for them. while there are people that i'd like to do everything for, i think love is a lot less exciting idea like that? life never is&nbsp;as&nbsp;exciting or beautiful or&nbsp;smooth as a movie and&nbsp;love stresses people out, they fight, they get annoyed with eachother, feelings are hidden, etc. i hear there are good parts but i don't often see them. that said- i love people who do whatever they want and show me their flaws, and i love happy people, people who laugh and who&nbsp;make me laugh, and i love people wearing good outfits or people with admirable dance skills... so i am free with my love, but not with my trust, and i feel&nbsp;that what i consider trust, others may&nbsp;consider love?&nbsp;i feel like i'm going to grow old loving everything, but not anyone. seems like people only become people that you say 'i love you' to if you trust them, so it's possibly something i'll miss out on unless i make a serious life change.<br /><br />i try not to look at that as a bad thing, anyway. at least i enjoy my life and think the world is an interesting, cool, weird and magical place?&nbsp;idk it holds me over"

"event","okay i'm gonna do this, and i started on the second, doing day one and two because then i thought i would be all caught up. however, i've been raving too hard and saved it without posting it, so now this entry shall include the first four days i guess.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Day 01 &ndash; Introduce yourself</strong><br /><br />my name is karen zurek, i live in calgary, alberta, canada. i have red hair that is approximately chin length, blue eyes and big old glasses. i work at a hair salon as a &quot;promotions coordinator&quot; which means i coordinate everyone's life for them and make posters in adobe illustrator. and also send e-mail newsletters and talk to funny people all day. i live with my friend named marcella, she's pretty funny. most of my life is spent sitting and laughing and eating. my memoir will be called eat, sit, laugh and nobody will read it. i am lucky enough to have other great people in my life, too. maybe i'll get a chance to talk about them later this month. sometimes i am happy and sometimes i am sad, but i have a pretty great life overall. i like to read, i like listening to music, i like making things, i like to walk and to sleep in clean sheets. i do a little of each every day to keep everything balanced.<br /><br /><strong>Day 02 &ndash; Your first love, in great detail</strong><br /><br />well i have never been in love with a person, so i don't have a first one to talk about, but i love all sorts of things so i'll talk about them a bit. i love summer and waking up early on saturday mornings to get coffee and shop for used books. i love going to bed early, and i love staying up all night because i am excited about something. i love bouncing around, i love learning things, i love music, i love ideas! i guess what i'm saying here is that i love my life and every time i'm in a really great space i look around in awe and think &quot;i love my life for the very first time!!!&quot; so maybe my first love is me, and how awesome i am!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />sorry, i'm working on my self confidence. but i do think that loving yourself is a huge key to loving other people, because normally i disgust myself and so does everyone else. but when i love myself? i love, or at least tolerate, everyone else!<br /><br /><strong>Day 03 &ndash; Your parents, in great detail</strong><br /><br />my dad is a quiet, miserable seeming kind of guy, but he rules. he is 52 and lives with my mom and sisters. he has a job that he thinks is just okay. he has been all over the world and is a pretty good storyteller. he has gray hair and blue eyes, wears untrendy dad clothes and is always fixing things. traits we share: introverted, &nbsp;curious, excitable, awkward in social situations.<br /><br />my mom is just crazy. she has back problems so she doesn't work, so most of the time she watches the food network, reads about food/internet memes online, rides her cooler scooter around, and hangs out in a hut she made my dad build in the backyard for her. this is called 'the shack' and all of her friends come over and drink in it. it legitimately looks straight out of a ridiculous sitcom, i can't believe it's in my life. that said, i love my mom. she's always trying to feed me, she sometimes does nice things, and she has found a way to enjoy her life. we both stress out about ridiculous things, get huffy instead of verbally upset, and fall asleep in movies all the time.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Day 04 &ndash; What you ate today, in great detail<br /></strong><br />well, all i've consumed today is water and a mocha. the water was in a ship regulars cup, and unfortunately was not enjoyable because it had been sitting beside my bed all night, but i was thirsty. the mocha i got at the purple perk, because i've developed an obsession with coffee shops and am trying them all. however, not reaaally diggin my coffee and don't know if it's going to be where i go to hang out. i decided i need somewhere to hang out in the winter that's not my house, work, or a bar, and a coffee shop seems like a safe, obvious, and nice idea.&nbsp;<br /><br />Day 05 &ndash; Your definition of love, in great detail<br />Day 06 &ndash; Your day, in great detail<br />Day 07 &ndash; Your best friend, in great detail<br />Day 08 &ndash; A moment, in great detail<br />Day 09 &ndash; Your beliefs, in great detail<br />Day 10 &ndash; What you wore today, in great detail<br />Day 11 &ndash; Your siblings, in great detail<br />Day 12 &ndash; What&rsquo;s in your bag, in great detail<br />Day 13 &ndash; This week, in great detail<br />Day 14 &ndash; What you wore today, in great detail<br />Day 15 &ndash; Your dreams, in great detail<br />Day 16 &ndash; Your first kiss, in great detail<br />Day 17 &ndash; Your favorite memory, in great detail<br />Day 18 &ndash; Your favorite birthday, in great detail<br />Day 19 &ndash; Something you regret, in great detail<br />Day 20 &ndash; This month, in great detail<br />Day 21 &ndash; Another moment, in great detail<br />Day 22 &ndash; Something that upsets you, in great detail<br />Day 23 &ndash; Something that makes you feel better, in great detail<br />Day 24 &ndash; Something that makes you cry, in great detail<br />Day 25 &ndash; A first, in great detail<br />Day 26 &ndash; Your fears, in great detail<br />Day 27 &ndash; Your favorite place, in great detail<br />Day 28 &ndash; Something that you miss, in great detail<br />Day 29 &ndash; Your aspirations, in great detail<br />Day 30 &ndash; One last moment, in great detail<br /><br /><br /><br />"

That song's going on the next one. Tonight I'm going to see Funny People because I am a movie fiend lately. It's because I am not drinking as much, though Friday was a good/wild time that included a potential limo ride and a guy in snakeskin boots hopping around me shouting about doing lines in said limo.

"event","i am feeling better about life on a daily basis. i mean, here i am! twenty years old, laying on my stomach with a wealth of knowledge at my fingertips and a delightful slushy beverage. i'm finding it more difficult, if only slightly, to see the bad in situations. life is weird, people are slipping away on a daily basis. new people are&nbsp;sprouting with springtime and it's just the circle of life.&nbsp;or something. god almighty!

yesterday i finally finished&nbsp;atlas shrugged,&nbsp;which marks the longest&nbsp;time i have ever spent reading a book in my&nbsp;entire life. and then today, i read anthem in&nbsp;its entirety. i've got my fill of ayn rand for a bit. tomorrow morning i will start brave new world.&nbsp;after that i think i'm just gonna read some zadie smith or something. i need a break from srs business.

i still love my job which is highly unusual for myself. today i retaught myself how to make formulas in microsoft excel which is a nice accomplishment i think. other than that, life is boring. i have launched a search for a boy best friend and i think i should see premium results soon. i hate the new facebook chat, not that i loved it before. my feet are cold, i can't find my needle, etc etcetc"

Intro 
What I want you to do is count to ten. 
Nine eight seven six five four three two 
on one you will be asleep. 
One 

Chorus 
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up 
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up 
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up 
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up 

Verse 
I'm dreaming about being a blunt 
I'm running around and I just can't wake up, Hah! 
I'm dreaming about being a blunt. Ho! 
I'm walking around and I just cant wake up. 

I'm tryin to wake up, I cant wake up 
So I run and jump 
someone yelled get that blunt. 
Get that blunt, now Im thinking this is major 
I've got a bunch of people chasing me with a razor 
I dont like this dream as a blunt 
But I can't get out of it 
And I cant seem to wake up 
So Im running and racing 
Blunt smokers are chasing 
This is insane, I'm caught by House Of Pain 
I'm picked up 
they said they gonna put my head out 
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out 
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready 
They poured the shumpang gently and rewet me 
Check it out now, in the same attire 
here comes the fire 
Now they lit it, now Im burning by the minute 
But check it out 
more heads came to chill 
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill 
Cypress Hill took a pull 
lungs are full, who's next? 
I'm being passed to Das Efx 
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps 
It's really smokey but I can still see Black Sheep 
Woe! Black Sheep gets me, relights me 
Room is proper, Im passed off to Shabba 
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba 
he said, ""Me no folllow no rumor"" 
and passed me to Grand Puba 
I wasnt burnin right so Puba got mad at me 
And said who rolled this 
and passed me to Kid Capri 
Kid Capri said ""I wont front 
pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt""
Redman said no need to re-roll 
and passed me to De La Soul 
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin 
now they're buggin cause they passed me to Bill Clinton 
Bill Clinton said I'll smoke but I won't inhale 
I'll only hit it twice 
he got slapped by Greg Nice 
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up 
I'm a blunt being smoked and I can't wake up 

Chorus 

Verse 
Get me out of this, somebody wake me up 
I'm still on fire and Im still being smoked up 
half my body is gone, now they're coming to my head 
now my head is being pinched by Ted-D-Ted 
A crazy nightmare i got to go 
I got to wake up and Im passed off to Yo-Yo 
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady 
She didnt smoke 
She passed me off to Showbiz and A.G. 
A.G. said respect due see 
he got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B. 
Smooth B. although he's talking to Ted-D 
took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy 
Freddy said Yo! There's nothing left Pop 
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock 
Chubb Rock said &quot;Yo Freddy chill! 
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill&quot;

Life's good, all I want is soft clean hair and an endless supply of tshirts. That's a lie, that's not all I want, but it's hard to pinpoint things right now. I'm just gonna take a shower."

-my job is still exciting! trying to decide what a good theme is for a fashion show, etc etc.
-watching the oc with a huge black bar over half of my tv. sucks!"

"event","my weird life. today was not the best day. i went and bought new nail polish and on my way back i walked by james and jeremy who were walking with purpose near blockbuster and i did not notice and instead of saying hello like a normal person james yelled 'smile karen'


oh brother. the nail polish i purchased is a good colour, but much to my chagrin (and total nonsurprise) shoppers does not carry bath tub stoppers. i am so bored bored bored, but i recommend you see the wackness, listen to conor oberst, lou reed and bootie mashups, and let your stomach growl for hours instead of just eating. easy easy easy."

-paying attention to only good or funny things
-lily allen
-tshirts
-having hours awake before work!!! working at 12 is dope. 
-the weather yesterday (hopefully today, i haven't been outside)

Life's good, weird, good. I think it would be better if I was in this lily allen video... but you win some and you lose some. Okay now Adele is on, and I'd just like to say that I don't think this is a good look for her. But she does look very British. I'm just writing in here because I am waiting for my garlic toast to finish. It is taking foreverrrr I think. PS Leah, I looked at the last entry and it definitely says Brandon. ADELE WHY DO YOU KEEP TOUCHING YOUR FACE LIKE THAT ARE YOU BLEEDING. ahhhh im dyin.

"event","2008, there was times when you were the worst year (a lot of them) but also times where you were the best (a lot of those too.) I'm going to call it on the good side because it is useless not to. Though the last few days have been too stressful for my liking, they at least made me realise I am friends with the right people. So that's a good start.

Also, 2009 is gonna kill it."

I want to live alone for a while, I have been extremely unimpressed with the entire world for the last week. Since I doubt that will happen, I would also like brain age 2 and a nintendo ds to play it on. More than that, I want a lot of money. Ah sleepytime. Too many things to think about."

And I sit around other people and talk about things while mostly still thinking about myself. Selfish. I also think about moving to Vancouver, having stomachaches and cleaning my room. One to two of those will take place tomorrow, I promise. Vancouver's unlikely though.<br /><br />That's my life. I have two friends which might be considered lame but I'm okay with it. They are good and my height. </p><p>I'm trying to surround myself with positivity. I can't find my diary though! And I'm too lazy to brush my teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I'm sure no one will find this interesting but I took pictures of me doing my homework for some reason and now I'm bored enough to post them. So, here is my life basically.

<lj-cut text=""dudes!"">

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22114.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
I start with the body. This assignment was a paper doll collection based on the late 1940s, early 1950s. When I do normal homework, I don't usually draw underwear on them.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22118.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a> 
Now I draw the clothes in pencil on normal printer paper. 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22122.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
When I've decided they are acceptable, I trace them onto marker paper and then outline them with a black micron pen.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22125.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Using prismacolour markers, I colour the outfits, adding highlights and shadows. 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22128.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Then, I use white and black pencil crayons to further add highlights and shadows.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22129.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
I also had to draw accessories. They were done exactly the same way as the clothing.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22132.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
I then cut the items out and glued them onto white cardstock. To add to the paperdoll effect, I drew dotted black lines and little tabs with a black micron pen.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22133.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Then, I glued them to more cardstock. In the upper right corner I wrote the dolls name (Ava) and the activity she would wear the outfit to. 

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22135.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Sorting out outfits.

Gluing.

The doll and her crinoline.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22142.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Ava entertains.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22143.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Ava goes to lunch. I really messed up the stripes on this one.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22144.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Ava goes out on the town.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22145.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Ava goes to church.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/K-A-R-E-N/april22146.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>
Ava goes to school.


It wasn't a huge assignment but it took me what felt like forever. 

In other news, there is some sort of bird pecking at my wall incessantly and I am incredibly bored. Also I have an incredibly runny nose. Ohh life. Well, I'm done school! Minus exams, but whooo cares?"

Last night I went to Calgary, hung out with Leah, got egged, saw Marcella and her little gang, ate a pita, slept, woke up, cleaned egg, drove back to Lethy, did homework, went to Boston Pizza, did homework, ate ice cream, wrote this. That's basically my life. I'm grateful for it, grateful for the people in it, for sunshine and for Ben and Jerry.&nbsp;

I'm done school in exactly two weeks. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh"

"event","Okay I'm addicted to talking about my life. But I guess it's okay, I'm just sitting here at 1:30 in the morning trying not to puke and wishing I could fall asleep. I tried to do homework but gave up as soon as I realised I'd have to go upstairs to get a pencil. I'm dropping out of art school, who am I kidding? I can't fit coffee in my portfolio and I just don't care enough about things to try and dress other people.

I am having problems eating lately and while I always have eating problems these ones involve near puking almost every time I think about food and it's just not fun. Also the other day I realised that I drink most of my calories. Which is I guess okay because if I didn't I don't think I would get as many as I should. I don't just mean alcohol drink, I just mean I'm a sucker for the drinking isn't fattening mindset. Not really, I guess I don't know what I'm talking about.

Other than wanting to puke and wanting to sleep and wishing I had no homework I just am pretty happy about life. I'm happy to have Leah and Marcella in my life, I'm happy that they have people in their lives that make them happy, I'm happy my family is so funny and that in 20 days I'm done my first year of college! I'm nervous though, that in a year and 20 days I'm basically expected to be an adult, no more transitions. No more parents-pay-rent and no more parents-bail-me-out. It's good though, I'm kind of excited. Yeah. I hope it all works out okay, I don't know why it wouldn't. I wish I tried harder in school this semester but I just could not. Instead I laid in bed thinking about how much I hate school and hate Lethbridge and don't know why I would pursue something so ridiculous. Now I'm laying in bed thinking about how much I should love school and sometimes do when I get to do okay things and how I guess Lethbridge could really be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot worse and how I am pursuing this because I want to do something I like instead of just standing around scanning things and turning into Lori Sardy.&nbsp;

God, tooooo deep. I really am in art school. Today/tomorrow I have to go back to Lethbridge for what is basically the last time in four months. And then it is summer when all I will do is work and sleep and hang out with good people and also even maybe okay people. Also I'm gonna try not to feel like this and I'm gonna tell people about all the things I know but never remember. My lips are chapped and my hair is dirty but I won't do anything about either of them for probably a while.&nbsp;

I'm quitting slurpees they keep me up forever and it just seems like sleeping is a lot more productive than refreshing the internet hoping something cool will happen. The internet isn't really that cool. Neither am I and neither is dirty laundry.&nbsp;

Cool as a cucumber."

"event","<p>Hiii world. Today what I did is woke up at 11, did some research, had a shower, cooked and ate roasted potatoes, blanched green beans and steak. I'm so good at cooking/ life. Went to class where I learned that I should stay in school because it's pretty fun and I WILL get a job. Life's good. Then I went to chapters/walmart/7-11 and then ate some more of the meal I made earlier and then I made oatmeal cookies and now I'm here.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ohhh. In a week basically I'm going home for the weekend which I'm pretty stoked on, since it's easter which means like chocolates and whatnot, and my dad's birthday which means maybe ice cream cake?! I wish! That's really what I want for my birthday next/this year. Remember that! Also Marcella is planning (or supposed to be) a night out on the town which is one more reason to be stoked.&nbsp;<br /><br />I wish one of my many readers was very interested in writing a paper on the environmental impact of the textile industry for me!</p>"

"event","Oh dear! I am so uninterested in writing about my life on the internet but Leah made a request the other day. So, my life has been good. Well, I'm kidding sort of because I really hated life until Friday and wanted to drop out of school and die. But then I went home and hung with Leah who is just the best and we are perfect. And here are a list of the five most hilarious and or best and or wonderful things and or shocking! things to happen in the weekend.

-Leah! DUH! I am glad to have a friend that dresses the same and makes faces the same and laughs mostly at the same thing and doesn't make a big deal about me not hugging and usually doesn't make a big deal when I say something dumb. I am also glad to have a friend that wears the same pair of pants every day. Hah!
-Watching someone sort of get stabbed! This falls under shocking and was really very shocking! Possibly the fastest I have ever seen a bartender run! Well I don't really have any other sort of thing to exclaim but let me tell you, it was really an exclamation-worthy experience.
-The best people ever who work at the ship and are very kind and every single one that has said anything to me since I can remember has called me sweetheart. And I really like that because it makes me feel like I am a really cool person. Or just a sweeeeeeetheart.
-How very huggable I am despite my general aversion to hugging. Let me tell you, I am so precious that randoms just wanna hug me and tell me about their welding career. Or it was the strangest attempt to make me wanna 'pick up.' Who picks up when they look like an 8 year old Amish princess?
-Suave Europeans/Serpents who say things that are pretty blush-worthy. But since I blush a lot I guess it's nothing.

Life is funny and wearing nightgowns to bars results in a lot more fun.

I wish I was a mermaid, I bet then I would have the most fun.

TIDBIT 342: I am really very good at not making the shot face, believe it.&nbsp;But I hate redbull a lot."

"event","dear diary.

i am at school, where i am waay too much. anyway i am bored of homework so i took a break to tell the world about my life. i do not even hate not having a computer. i do hate having to be at the school for 15 hours outside of class time doing homework. plus home homework. i also hate not talking to my friends and learning good facts on the internet. what i do instead is learn good facts on television. this weekend i am going home for a whole week which i could not be happier about despite the fact that i have maybe twenty dollars in my bank account and i do not know how that is supposed to get me by. daaamn. i think i should get my computer back in 2-4 weeks now. i hope. as much as i don't mind spending a ton of time being productive, i am so bored/lonely. laaame. 

last sunday i did all of the dishes which took an hour after i spent a solid 10 hours doing homework. and then i cleaned the living room which took a while because i had just spent 10 hours cutting and pasting and colouring and so had dani and we had probably also done this previously. anyway i was very happy to go to bed after that only to wake up five hours later to go to school for 8 hours and then do more homework. i think the real point of this very sad story is that katie was doing no homework and did not have school the next day and since then noone has done the dishes and there are none left and our house is disgusting. if it's not clean when i go home i'm gonna pull a kristine. just kiddin im too laid back for such tomfoolery. 

there is more snow here than i've seen in forever and i do not like it at all. i have to basically climb mountains to get to school and driving looks like hell not that i've done it because i am too busy/tired/scared to leave the house. in that order, minus scared because i'm not really i just don't want to start my car and scrape it and slide. etc. anyway. it is a very inconvenient form on precipitation and i'm not excited to drive home in it on friday.

anyway, back to homework because that's how i dooo."

"event","Heyyyy faithful readers. My computer is broken. Kaput. ETC. I don't get it back for 4-6 weeks. I guess now it's 3-5. But still I am dying. The only good things are I shower more often and do more homework. I guess technically it's better but my thumbs are not limber enough to constantly text my only friend Leah W. I am on my roomies laptop right now. What an angel. I guess next year I am moving into new res with dani and sara and possibly katie which is pretty good i guess. 

Other than that, all I'm interested in lately is eating. Here are my favourite foods:
-rice cakes
-water
-strawberry marshmallows
-pistachios
-wildberry punch
-everything :( i have a real overeating problem lately.

I cut my bangs today, that's pretty interesting. For some reason it reminded me of the time Carly tried to make me look older to get into Coyotes. I guess because she cut my bangs that night and I guess since then I probably haven't. Anyway, it's silly of me but I've been in a weird mood all day, possibly because of it. It's not really that I want to be friends with her anymore because frankly, she has become the kind of person I would not really want in my life anyway but it's just a really harsh reminder. And stuff.

Anyway I think I might dye my hair darker because well, I want to. Next Friday I'm going back to Calgary and I'm way stoked about that. I'm getting pretty sick of the coulees. And excited to hang out with Leah and Marcella. 

I feel sick. Probably because I ate what a small african country needs to survive for a month all in one day. Also I am sick of hearing about celebrities and I'm really into learning. And I wish I was an excellent pattern drafter. And that sewing didnt make me want to sew my fingers.

It will come. Hopefully soon because I'm not feeling too great about school right now. Or most things. Except for reading week and even then I have a full house at home. I just want to be home alone for a while! I guess the drive home will do me good.

Anyway, I don't know when I will be back, maybe next week, maybe in a month but it's okay. Promise."

"event","I am in a weird mood. Kristine is gone, it is nice because it feels like mom left. We can turn up the tv loud and listen to music and jump around. So that's good. Dani is trying to learn how to pick a lock so we can go in her room? I don't know. She left a bowlful of hamburger helper on the counter for us, so I'm pretty happy about that. 

Other than that roommate news Dani is fighting with Darcy in the most hilarious fashion and I am in the weirdest mood. The kind where I am angry for no reason and want to snap necks. Yikes. I am going to have to stop that. And also go to bed soon because I am eating too much. I'm gonna eat myself to the point of obesity and that's all I think about. Ahh.

Dani ordered absinthe off the internet and I don't even want to drink it but pretty soon I think we will have an absinthe party. Oh dear. I am stressed about homework but not doing any and I am just in a really frustrated mood. 

I hate watching other people channel surf."

"event","I can not wait to go to sleep. I know it will feel nice. I hate homework so much, boo. I had a pretty good weekend, though. On Friday I went to the Ship with Leah and Katie and then Marcella came which was good because I don't like very many people but she is one I do so it was nice to see. Then on Saturday I went to COWBOYS with Katie and Leah and some of Katie's friends, which was okay if only because the entire night I devised clever lies to tell people if they asked me questions. But instead I just got accused of budging. And danced because that is what I do apparently. I wish that I was not in Lethbridge because I kind of find it to be a butthole. Kristine is moving out tomorrow, I can feel it in my bones. And I can see all of her boxes packed so that really helps my intuition here. 

Okay I'm leaving because guess what! I need to finish my homework to go to bed to wake up tomorrow and do more homework. Boo."

"event","Journey makes Detroit sound cool, Eminem does not. I don't know. I love Journey though. What I wish is that I was taking the midnight train somewhere or sleeping for a long time or sitting in the sun or hanging out with Leah and Marcella. I'm not! It's okay. I think I will cope.

I will not cope with the fact that every designer in the world made a white/black collection for spring 2007. Screw that, INDUSTRY. I am unimpressed with school today. And homework. And most things in my life. Damn! I am trying to tell myself I am in the right place and I love it but today I am not and I don't. I have a nervystomachache and am in a very bad mood. Instead of complaining about my pretty good life on the internet, I'm going to do my homework. And maybe be driven to TEARS."

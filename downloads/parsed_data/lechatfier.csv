"event","The wild irises are growing again, and the exciting thing is that there are even more of them now than there were last summer! Each day they grow a little taller and more come up from the ground and I skip a few steps in anticipation of their glowing purple and gold beauty. I love Spring!



(on a side note... if I ever, ever get married, - with three weddings to attend this spring alone, I am getting impatient- I want irises in my bouquet and my colours to be shimmery medium blue and purple).

Is the adage ""three times a bridesmaid, never a bride"" true? I'm really hoping not because I will be a bridesmaid for the third time in May. *mentally lights a firecracker under Ryan's chair*"

I spoke today with the lady again and she told me she has been talking with her friend and agreed to use a scratch removal kit and only replace her license plate frame (which was plastic anyway) because she will probably have something similar only worse happen in the next six months, being accident prone, and I have been keeping her up to date on all the possibilities my parents and I have come up with for taking care of paying her for damages. In sum, she is calling this all off.

While I had been waiting to make a left-hand turn out of this driveway, a car had pulled in behind me, which surprised me because the parking lot was pretty empty. Unfortunately, I didn't know it had pulled behind me until I heard Tara's car bump into it and saw the jaw of the bike guy drop. Fortunately, the driver was pretty nice about it, saying this happens to her two to three times a year. I gave her my number and driver's license number and when I got home I called her so she would know the number I gave her was legit and she offered to send me a copy of the estimate so she gave me her e-mail address so I could e-mail her my mailing address. And, there were only a few scratches on her front bumper... hopefully that means the estimate isn't too high. Sigh. Other than this, my day has been great!"

<TD>Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that: <BR><BR>You prefer your romance and love to be traditional rather than daring or out-of-the-ordinary, you would rather be pursued than do the pursuing and, when it comes to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own. <BR><BR>This places you in the Lover Style of: <B>The Devoted Lover</B>. <BR><BR>The Devoted Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and is perhaps the best Lover Style when it comes to developing a long-term, caring and rewarding relationship. The Devoted Lover is a treasure to find, though it is sometimes difficult to time establishing a relationship with one just right; usually, this is the last romantic relationship you'll need to find, so sow any wild oats first. <BR><BR>In terms of physical love, the Devoted Lover can be shy at first but gradually warms and eventually can be a thrilling partner who knows every need of his/her partner. Given a strong and loving relationship, and the right lover, the Devoted Lover can be a delight in bed. <BR><BR>Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Suave Lover (most of all) or the Classic Lover, or the Carnal Lover. <BR><BR>Congratulations! <BR><BR>If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback!

"event","My dad has yet again lost another job and it is fear for what retaliation might ensue and destroy him further that refrains me from calling his former school and giving the principal a tongue lashing she will not quickly forget. I'd also like to kick her in the shin for good measure. He is nearly 60 for Pete's sake, and already just starting over in careers! He does not need this. Of course, I am speaking from my limited human understanding and I know that God will provide something else more suited for him and I didn't like how the school he was with took advantage of and ran over the teachers and he had only been there a year and was planning on leaving anyway to do student teaching for his credentialing programme (blasted APU, wanting eighteen weeks of full time student teaching... hang high standards! Why can't it be like Cal Baptist which requires fourteen weeks of part time student teaching? :-)~ ), but that was to be in September and this is mid-Spring semester of all the possible times to let three teachers go! Way to screw yourself and the remaining teachers over, as well as your former employees! I am thankful that my mom has a part time job, as does Daniel, so Deej at least can pay for some of the things he wants, like lunch at school and new skateboards, but if the dental insurance does not carry through for the next month, my family will have to pay full price for Deej's wisdom teeth removal and Mom's crown replacement and possible gum graft. Woot. And I still owe my parents bunches for paying my credit card bills... *guilt* Fortunately, he has started right away in pursuing job options and hopefully something will work out soon. My worry is that he won't be able to focus on his classwork and will struggle in his classes- however, now he has more time to work on his assignments. Hmmm..."

"event","I was correcting midterm essays for Level 5 students at work today and got curious about their assigned topic, which was to consider the International Justice Mission work of rescuing children from forced prostitution and slavery, or to write about legalizing prostitution and take a stance on either topic (they had researched the latter already, the topic being one they chose to research as a class for the semester and practice their writing skills with). Curious about something Michael, their instructor, had told me about as he was explaining what I should look for, I spent the last few minutes at work reading an article and commentaries on the subject.

Here's some of what I found:

http://www.prostitucio.hu/janice.raymond.2004.05.28.en.htm

http://hortensia.ca/Prostitution/Prostitution_germany.htm

http://www.freedominion.ca/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=36344&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0

I can't find the original article that I found at work, but one of these reacts to it, where a woman in Germany seeking employment was referred to a position as a prostitute by an unemployment agency and was threatened with the revoking of her unemployment benefits if she did not take the job. That made my heart sick as I read, and yet it is not enough to have an emotional reaction. I want to go out and pummel some a** of those in Germany who thought legalizing prostitution would increase the safety of the prostitutes and decrease the amount of crime. Were they truly thinking compassionately and with everyone's best interests in mind, or were they hoping to have their personal sins of participation in prostitution legally absolved? Bah!"

I got asked if I was Paddington Bear once (shows literary and cultural knowledge, thankfully), and if I was the Morton Salt girl twice (then told I looked like the Morton Salt girl by another person). Sigh. Halloween was fun though. I went to a party with Ryan on Saturday, and then another party held by three of the housing areas at APU. The most clever costume I saw was gum stuck to the bottom of a shoe. The cutest was my friend Christina who dressed up as a police car. Long week ahead, and then I am free for a week! Yah!"

"event","I am through with school, fianlly. This was not a satisfying semester, academically. I didn't fail any of my courses, but I did not give them the attention they deserved. As one of my professors commented in the middle of the term, I was distracted and distant. I haven't paid proper attention to anyone in so long, not even myself, but where my attention went I do not know. There have been so many people (at least for me) to keep involved with along with schoolwork, work, my grandfather and family... Now I have a month before summer camp begins and a different type of insanity starts. In the meantime, I am finishing a quilt I began in junior high that Mom found while cleaning her sewing room, helping out with the junior high group at church, hopefully riding my bike every day, sleeping in, prepping for camp and a little for next semester, cleaning, reading, and trying to find a focus again. I have been a little out of sorts, sometimes more than other times, all semester. Nice time to be in a funk. :) I have had wonderful times too, but joining the junior high group tonight reminded me how out of touch I am with parts of my world that I used to be so involved in. I hate losing touch with people and activities that I used to hold dear. *sigh* Not an entirely lackluster day, for all of that. I read some of <i>The Sword in the Stone</i> this morning, watched <i>The Adventures of Tom & Huck</i> (yes, I am aware that came out when we were in junior high and was a kid's movie even then), and burned cds for Mom at the church office. I also flirted, lightly, with Josh, the worship and junior high leader. It is nice to be noticed, even if it is by a guy who shoots staples at you across a room and flirts more with Kayla. I never would pursue something with Josh, but he can be fun and he is very gifted vocally and artistically (*envious*). I should get going to bed... sigh. Sleep is wonderful. :)"

"event","""21 Things I Want In A Lover"" by Alanis Morissette

Do you derive joy when someone else succeeds? 
Do you not play dirty when engaged in competition? 
Do you have a big intellectual capacity but know 
That it alone does not equate wisdom? 
Do you see everything as an illusion? 
But enjoy it even though you are not of it? 
Are you both masculine and feminine? politically aware? 
And don't believe in capital punishment? 

These are 21 things that I want in a lover 
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer 

Do you derive joy from diving in and seeing that 
Loving someone can actually feel like freedom? are you funny? 
la self-deprecating? like adventure? and have many formed opinions?

These are 21 things that I want in a lover 
Not necessarily needs but qualities that I prefer 
I figure I can describe it since I have a choice in the matter 
These are 21 things I choose to choose in a lover 

I'm in no hurry I could wait forever 
I'm in no rush cuz I like being solo 
There are no worries and certainly no pressure in the meantime 
I'll live like there's no tomorrow 

Are you uninhibited in bed? more than three times a week? 
Up for being experimental? are you athletic? 
Are you thriving in a job that helps your brother? are you not addicted?

"event","Today. Today was a blast. I think Ryan is getting used to my being quiet when I am content and not questioning why I don't talk very much, just smile at everything. He was quiet too. And the garden. Amazing. Tranquil, even with so many people meandering through it. Lovely koto music, good dancing, and terrific drum playing (I forget what the name is of that style of playing). Yummy tea also. It was good to be with him, watching the koi and laughing/admiring/learning about them, learning about Japanese gardening methods, following the butterflies as best as I could without running after them, and... if he ever reads this he will probably laugh because it will be overkill for him... there were so many adorable little kids everywhere. One, about one and half or two toddled to his father, who was lying on his back on the grass, and fell on top of him. Then, as his parents started to leave, he walked to the red wagon pulled by his mother and tumbled in, faceplanting in something soft. There were a couple babies being carried in the baby slings that remind me of the way Nigerian mothers carry babies and how Mom carried Beth and me when we were babies, only the ones today were across the chest and Mom had us on her back.

We went to dinner afterwards and shared drinking stories from our study abroad times. Drinking games can get ugly. I had a chicken pot pie, which reminds me both of Cornish pasties and the Scottish meat pies Grandpa would sometimes bring when he would visit us from Florida (we found an ad while we were there for a British shop that sells Scotch meat pies, but it was the day we were leaving. But we have the ad still, so something needs to be done with it. Maybe in the month before camp...). I was just reminded how hard it is sometimes to be home, and in the most routine actions. Setting the table, I take out enough dishes for five settings if I don't think about it. After dinner, I half expect to go into the family room and turn on the tv to sports for Grandpa, or expect to hear it playing and when I enter to see him sitting in his chair. Entering the living room from the front door, I instinctively turn to the chair in the corner to greet him. Helping Mom paint his room this month will be strange.

Anyway, we also went to see Hitchhiker's, completely forgetting bathrobes and towels in attempts to get inside the theatre in time. Then, when we drove home, we talked about the movies The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Kingdom of Heaven, Lord of the Rings, and Arthur (fears that KoH will be like Arthur in stinktified history or that the fanatical Christians will be all the ones killing, and LOTR, particularly Legolas being made into fan fodder, and noting that fantasy movies based on books are getting even more popular). That ended up in a discussion about the wonders of the Irish, mostly Turkey talking and me nodding in agreement then my laughing at the Miller/Budweiser billboards by the Miller brewery while he was talking about the Gangs of New York soundtrack that was playing. He joined Amy and me for Death by Chocolate, then left to drive home.

The sun just slipped its note below my door
And I can't hide beneath my sheets
I've read the words before so now I know
The time has come again for me

And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
Feelin' the same way all over again
Singin' the same lines all over again
No matter how much I pretend

Another day that I can't find my head
My feet don't look they're my own
I'll try and find the floor below to stand
And I hope I reach it once again

And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
Feelin' the same way all over again
Singin' the same lines all over again
No matter how much I pretend

So many times I wonder where I've gone
And how I found my way back in
I'll look around awhile for something lost
Maybe I'll find it in the end

And I'm feelin' the same way all over again
Feelin' the same way all over again
Singin' the same lines all over again
No matter how much I pretend"

Burning Bridges 

Been thinking a lot about my ways
Guess I'm trying baby
Been searching out a way to say
Guess I'm sorry baby
This time I give all to you
It's time I prove something to you

So I'll lift you up and hold you near
Warm your heart and calm you fears
See I don't want to lose this love I found
So I'll burn my bridges, burn them down

Been hurting a lot without you here
Guess I need you baby
Been sleeping upon a bed of tears 
Guess I miss you baby
This time I give all to you 
It's time I prove something to you

Take all my world and shake it
Take my dear heart and embrace it
Take what I say and listen
My world's changing, changing for you
 

In other news, Dave and I are going to the Jars of Clay concert at APU tonight. Whee!"

She Gathers Rain 

Today she dresses
For the change she's facing now
And the storm that's raging
A safe haven she has found
She doesn't care
What the prophets say anymore
For the love she had
She has no more
So she gathers rain
She gathers rain
To rinse away all her guilt and pain
She gathers rain
She gathers rain
To wash and cleanse and make
her whole again

Her imagination
Has started stretching wide
And her new conviction
No longer will she hide
She's not branded
When prophets speak words of fire
The same love she gives
She requires
So she gathers rain
She gathers rain
To rinse away all her guilt and pain
She gathers rain
She gathers rain
To wash and cleanse and make
her whole again


More a song for the past than for now, except for the second stanza and the lines: ""The same love she gives She requires""."

Wasting Time 

Something's going wrong inside of you
Burdens bearing down and seeping through
Well, I don't want to bleed anymore for you
And I don't want to breathe any hatred too

Sitting while your world just floats around
Now you want to move 'cause it's crashing down
Well, I don't want to sing you guarantees
And I don't want to cling to our use to be's
So take your heart, take your soul
Just get yourself on out of here
Yeah, take your hurt, take your pain
Just get yourself on out of here

Wasting time
That's all you'll do if you're waiting for me
Wasting time
I don't see what you think I see
Wasting time
That's all you'll do if you're waiting for me
Wasting time
I don't want what you think I need"

Forgiveness 

In my silence I would love to forget 
But restitution hasn't come quite yet 
And with one accord I keep moving forth 
I stretch my heart to heal some more 

It used to be all I'd want to learn 
Was wisdom trust and truth 
But now all I really want to learn 
Is forgiveness for you 

As my seasons change I've now grown to know 
When one's heart creates, one's soul doesn't owe 
So I wash away stains of yesterday 
Then tempt my heart with love's display"

"event","The Word of the Day for Apr 09 is:  
vermicular \ver-MIK-yuh-ler\ adjective 

1 *a : resembling a worm in form or motion b : marked with irregular fine lines or with wavy impressed lines 
2 : of, relating to, or caused by worms 
 
 
Example sentence:
""[The painting] 'Evening' shows what was likely a meandering stream that in Criss's treatment is less vermicular than just plain geometric."" (Susan Lindt, Intelligencer Journal [Lancaster, PA], July 3, 2003) 
 
Did you know?
What does the word ""vermicular"" have in common with the pasta on your plate? If you're eating vermicelli (a spaghetti-like pasta made in long thin strings) the answer is ""vermis,"" a Latin noun meaning ""worm."" If you dig deep enough, you'll find that ""vermis"" is the root underlying not only ""vermicular"" and ""vermicelli,"" but also ""vermiculate"" (which can mean either ""full of worms"" or ""tortuous"") and even ""worm"" itself.

"event","I had a detailed dream this morning, a sortof Robin Hood, Potato Blight in Ireland, Protecting Jews from Nazis dream. The Robin Hood figure looked something like Christian Bale from Newsies. Somehow I ended up with a baby purportedly his by another girl (later I found out the father was another rebel, but ""Robin"" had taken over providing for it and its mother) and then pulling a little boy who was lost into my house just before curfew came and he would be taken away for still being on the streets. Shortly after that I woke up. I don't know if the dream dictionary online has anything on dreaming about Robin Hood, but it would be interesting to know what this dream might've meant (that I have too much of a fixation with Robin Hood? Ireland? The European Resistance?)."

"event","The Word of the Day for Mar 31 is:  
contiguous \kun-TIG-yuh-wus\ adjective 

: being in contact : touching; also : next, adjoining 
 
 
Example sentence:
The new airline will fly to all of the 48 contiguous states in the United States, but it will not have any flights to Alaska or Hawaii. 
 
Did you know?
You probably aren't surprised to learn that the word ""contact"" is a relative of ""contiguous,"" but would you believe that ""contagion"" and ""contingent"" are too? All of those words derive from the Latin ""contingere,"" meaning ""to have contact with."" The words ""contact"" and ""contiguous"" are fairly easy to connect with ""contingere,"" but what of the other two? In its early days in English, ""contingent"" was used as a synonym of ""touching,"" and if you remember that touching something can pollute it (and that another meaning of ""contingere"" was ""to pollute""), ""contagion"" logically ties in too.

*Indicates the sense illustrated in the example sentence.

I cant believe you still read my journal
Bored?
i wasnt aware i only made ten an hour.
At least i've put up with small annoyances to gain long term employment and a job i wont get fired from. And at least i havent had more than one job in a year. 
Unlike some people.
And so fucking what if i go online? Who doesnt that has internet access?
My work is done, its always right and there's never a problem.
So fuck you for bashing me.
I've dropped issues about you or with you. Kindly do the same. 
Unlike you i dont remove comments so people cant respond.
Thank you for now making my journal friends only."

i had to read it in the company newsletter. My boss couldnt tell me the date and said i had to contact HR to get it myself.
Woops? Its in the newsletter. Good to see he's hard at work to help me out, like i help him all the time.
And of course no word yet on a raise.
And I'm supposed to get some gay gold plated pin with two saphires.
I'm not amused, still.

Today is just a shit day.
I cant have lunch with my mother because my boss cant answer the phones.
I can NEVER go out to lunch until R gets here and then its too late to go anywhere with anyone.
How irritating is this?
How hard is it to answer the phone?
Why have I not gotten a raise in over two yrs.
I am tired of doing everything while my boss sits back.
I'm tired of doing his dirty work for him (firing/giving people different hours or smaller shift hours)
BAH
I really need to look for something else.
This is ridiculous."

<TD>You are most like Hephaestus, the god of fire and craft! Hephaestus was a patron of blacksmiths. Hardworking, incredibly clever, though a bit of a loner. Known for forging incredible gifts and clever traps. Achilles' armour at the battle Troy is attributed to him, as is Pandora's Box. Unfortunately, while he was off toiling, his beautiful wife Aphrodite was cheating on him with Ares. So while you're into making things and are a straightforward genuine person, don't forget to pay attention to your loved ones from time to time! </TD></TR>

My mom came over yesterday with her puppy.
We hung out from about 2:30 until 8.
No fights really but near the end it was so hot in the condo i was getting bitchy and uncomfortable.
We watched The Incredibles and Practical Magic. She was having a good time and loved the tv and surround sound.
I served the corned beef, cabbage and potato's and she ate two bowls. Plus we had yummy corn on the cob, and for dessert I made her tropical fruit with coconut pinapple haagan daaz with pineapple apricot preserves on top.
Also made yummy drinks. Diet Seven Up with some concord grape juice and lemon juice. Lots of ice.
It was a nice night.
The puppy wouldnt stop wriggling around, eating random things from the floor, jumping around the couches, biting.
She's cute just obnoxious. Didnt stop for anything!
I missed Stephen. He went to M and D's place for some Magic the Gathering.
He's supposed to drive the pump truck to Whittier today and possibly spend the night.
I really hate that idea but oh well. Its money for him.
I will probably crash when I get home.
The place looks much cleaner. I need to air it out and spray some air freshener though its so musty.
I forgot my lunch like an idiot today. So bagel chips and water it is.
Wasnt much in the mood for more cabbage and beef.
That seems to be more Stephen's favorite than mine.
I cant buy lunch either.
Pretty much broke until the 16th :(
I hope everyone had a good weekend.
Today is going to suck. I can just feel it."

okay i just finished searing both roasts.
For some reason that test made me feel stupid in some spots. lol.
I put the roasts in the crock pot with a nice white country sauce with pepper. It smells and tastes good.
I snuck a few pieces to Stephen and once he even humped my leg ;)
So it must be good so soon :)
We'll see around noon how things are looking.

Filled about 6 bags total.
Stephen's going to make the hard floors nice and shiney. He's a genius at that. I 'm just horrid at doing floors.
I wiped the bathroom up pretty good and we even have a sink and counter! woo.
Cleared the living room table, cleaned the glass. There's a few odds and ends on the floor i cant get due to pelvic stabbing pains and mass bleeding.
I need to save up for a vacuum. Ours broke its belt and just stinks when you use it.
There's still little piles here and there, and the spare room... well thats just a landfill in itself. The walkin closet needs cleaning out too.
I'll save that project for when i'm not hurting so badly.
Going to make two corned beef roasts, with tons of cabbage, potato's and my yummy country white pepper gravy. yummmmmmmmm.
Stephen will hang out with M and D tomorrow and bring them some servings. The rest will be my mom's and my dinner, and leftovers for the manlings lunches.
Going to try and conserve the food we have. Bought two bulk bags of veggies, and some turkey/chicken and portabello mushroom sausage burger patties.
They had samples at Costco and were hella good.
Also got some Japanese Mochi  ice cream at costco of all places. You have to try it, its just YUM.
so w00t for not getting paid til a week and a half and only having 40 bucks. And have you seen the prices of gas?
I didnt think it went up ten cents in a week. GAH.
Now i really have to conserve driving.
I'm currently bored and lounging in front of the A/C
If i had funds I'd be at a movie right now. :P
I hope everyone has a good weekend.
I will think of you all when i'm making a crapload of spaghetti and sauce to last a week. Brokeness rocks!"

We spent some time with a couple of live journal friends, a couple :)
D and M are super nice and have a lot in common with us.
M came to pick me up at home. Kinda shocking not many people can do that!
Went to their place and chatted til Stephen got off work and came over.
I got some new clothes. New used ones but I will put them to good use.
Thank you so much guys.
It'll be nice not to have holes in my clothes and smaller sizes :D
We stayed til about nine and headed home.
I think D and I are going to have fun crocheting :) I've never had someone to do that with.
And uh oh, she hasnt seen SATC. So i'll have to show her a few episodes and see if she can get into it.

As for this weekend, nothing is planned Saturday. Stephen will probably work, while i try to tidy up the house (HAHAHA).
Need to get a few things at Costco or we wont be eating. Should be interesting on a 30 dollar budget. Priority, veggies, then meat (which i havent been able to afford ever. LOL)
Sunday going to get up early and get the crock pot set up for my famous corned beef and cabbage that stews in a white pepper gravy. Its one of Stephen's favorite dishes. I managed to buy extra roasts during St Patrick's Day. They're usually uber cheap.
All I need is cabbage and some red tato's.
Both are cheap.
I'm going to make this feast for D and M :)
I'm hoping they like it 
So i'm hoping we all have a good enjoyable weekend. 
Stephen and i were afraid we scared them off last night. No such luck :D
But thats a good thing.
Have a good weekend everyone!"

About plus sized pageants for big woman have to be a size 14.
I think its an excellent idea.
Monique the host, said something that had me cracking up for a bit.
""Yes I may have two stomachs, and yes, I may have two chins. On a good day the third chin comes out!""
LOL Now for some people its not funny. I'm amused because she's so positive about herself. She thinks everyone has beauty even if they're larger sized.  And I'm always appreciative of sarcasm :)
I wish more people could be positive about heavy woman. And plus sized women could be more confident.
If we had more people that werent so negative about anything over a size 14.

I made him chicken fajita's and refried beans for dinner and lunch today.
I will post my good news this afternoon i'm thinking.
I lost another 2 lbs this week. I think its going so well because the negative influence isnt in my life anymore.
I dont feel bad anymore about losing weight or finally liking myself.
If Stephen gets off at a decent time Friday we might see if we're invited to Bonnie and Phil's and make a stop. I have to return her movies to her anyways. And it would be a good excuse to see them.

I have good news but am going to wait on it to post it.
On a lighter note, I found an old tape recorder that I used to drag everywhere.
I was listening to it and found it to have Samie and my visits to the chiropractor. I kept listening with one of those shit eating grins, and laughing, giggling madly.
Stephen probably thought I was mental (what else is new)
I'm easily amused by it and will listen to it once in a while to rehash fun memories.
There were also a few recordings of me singing at Al's for karaoke, along with Bonnie and I singing a Moulin Rouge song, and me doing Shakira, along with Queensyrche, Leanne Rhimes, and Tori Amos.
I miss singing. I just cant deal with the bar scene anymore. I cant bring Stephen til he's graduated from Job Corps, and I would like to include him since he's been under job corps rule.
Soon. I will take him somewhere to celebrate. I hope C and G can go with us :)
I just spent half an hour slicing, and dicing immitation crab, pasta shells into slivers, big dill pickles into tiny cubes, onions, etc. Oy. my hand is hurting bigtime as well as my neck. But the masterpiece seafood pasta salad is done :D
If only i had some shrimp or other stuff to add. It will do.
I hope everyone has a good nite. I'm going back to my hermitting routine til Stephen gets home."

I will probably go out next weekend. Just aching all over, lower back pain. When i have it bad i just want to lay around and be broccoli.

Three things on my wish list.
1. clothes that fit. No more flappy overly big pants or shirt with holes. I'm down to 2 pants and 2 shirts. :(
2. jelly beans
3. funds to purchase both.

"event","I'm beginning to wonder why i bother brushing my hair when there's barely anything to brush?
Looks like we may not be going to Nikiski as planned, due to Stephen having to work all day tomorrow. Blah.
Looks like the condo will be a forced clean. It needs it badly. I'm going to motivate myself to fill 3-4 bags of things we dont need anymore.
Our bedroom light cover has become a suicide runway for flies and bee's that find their way in past the A/C unit.
Thats the only thing i hate about it, is that there's no screen on the window when its running or not.
Last night i watched a bee and a huge ass fly just buzz towards the light.
They stepped into the light and BAM a row of em have shown up. Strange behavior.
Well I sent my dad a brocure of the college. They want a little over 3 thousand dollars tuition.
No way.
So he wants me to call my bank and see if they offer any classes (which i highly doubt).
I'm already frustrated, but i want to learn about finances and investing. Its something most people should really know.
My breakfast of a handful of Frito's scoops isnt appealing to me.
My head is throbbing and I already want to go home. Bah.
So my agenda for the weekend is, researching college/uni's for financial courses. Preferably online ones.
And cleaning this condo. The messy shit is getting to me to the point i've been staying in the cleanest room of the house. Which also happens to contain the A/C :D
I hope everyone has a good weekend. I'm hoping my neck and lower back stop hurting so i can follow through with said agenda.

Thank you for taking my meme even if it was kinda fruity. 
And thank you today for going by quickly. Please?
Truck is making funkier noises.
Going to ask my boss for Monday off. Short notice, possibility of a ""no"" but will try anyways. Would be nice to take our time in Nikiski, and not hurry back since Stephen might work part of Saturday. Thats enough to get us there, eat dinner, spend part of the day with family, his friends and run home. bleh.
We could use a mini vacation.
Day 6 and my mom is still not talking to me. Should i be grateful or worried? I dont even see her pop online.
Still havent heard from the University. I'm disturbed about that.
Other than that, have a good day."

"event","So.
I'm bored and creating a meme.

I know most of you go through hair colors like men.. mwahaha j/k. But i know a bunch of us do go through phases.
The object of this meme is to see how many colors people use to find out true hair colors (if we remember)



What is your natural hair color?  <b>Auburn</b>

What color do you wish it was? <b>Dark Red or deep auburn</b>

Name as many colors as your hair has been, making sure you do multiple colors in one category.
<b>Vampire Red
Plum
Teal
Aftermidnight Blue
Tiger Lily
Cinnamon
Vampire red and Violet
Infra Red
Deadly Nightshade and Vampire Red
Raven and Vampire Red
Shocking Blue and Forest Green
Pillarbox Red, Vampire Red and Porn Blonde to make highliights
Cardinal Red</b>

What is your favorite brand to use?  <b>Manic Panic or Herbal Essence. The only ones that dont fry what little hair i have left</b> 

Any colors you'd be willing to try, but havent? <b>Anything really yellow from manic panic, or bright pink. I havent colored my hair in ages but want to.</b> 

If you know me, have any suggestions for hair color? (please post in comments)

Okay thats it. My pathetic meme. I'm just curious about what people use, or have done. I miss coloring my hair.
If you have any pictures of yourself with hair colors that are not the norm post em!
Those of you that live in AK, we should have a hair coloring GT at my place or something :)"

"event","some concerned people have emailed or posted concerns for me asking how i was, etc.
Things with Stephen and I couldnt be better.
My health is another story.
Still losing weight (yay)
But in a lot of pain, stomach, and lower body stuff.
Not to mention a lovely burst of PCOS next week sometime that I can look forward to (not!)
I've been online less for good reason. Whether it be drama, or me thinking nobody cares (even tho i know a few of you really do)
I'm just learning to appreciate a world outside of internet.
I'm also applying to online college so I can take the courses my dad requires. I think it would be brilliant to learn about stocks, bonds, and what I can invest my money into one day when my father leaves it to me.
Stephen and I are talking about going to Nikiski this weekend. I hope he gets new tires before we go, seeing as how his are almost completely bald in some spots, and he has no spare. 
I wish we didnt have to worry about our vehicles all the time. Its irritating.
I'm looking forward to being off at 3 and spending my alone time in front of the AC with a good book or a video game.
I might even get motivated and do some cleaning seeing as how the spruce beetles suck this year.
If we do go this weekend i'm looking forward to spending time with Stephen's parents. Especially his mom. They're awesome.
I find out if i got approved for online university stuff this afternoon/evening.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
I'd wish everyone a good day but it seems like the same 4 or 5 people read or comment anymore so ... yea.. have a good day ;P"

I can only hope i stop feeling sick long enough to enjoy part of the day.
Craving steamed rice as always.
I really need to get a steamer because this pan cooked rice sucks.
Things have been good with Stephen and I.
still have the occasional bicker session but it hasnt been as bad as it used to.
i hope he has a short shift today. I'm going to make stuffed turkey boobs, smothered with sautted veggies in a fat free cream sauce.
Should be a new dish :)
Hope everyone has a good day."

We ate at Red Robin for lunch.
Been sick since. So much pain.. so much vomit. So much... ugh..
Stephen left to go to his friends house as i ran for the bathroom.
I'm home alone. Shaking in a cold sweat. Feeling crappy.
I have no clue how to stop feeling bad.
My throat is on fire.
All we got were nacho appetizer and two chicken burgers. 
I wish I'd stop getting sick at every little thing.
It was such a fabulous weekend.
The house is a mess.
Everytime I try to clean or get out of bed, dizzy, nausea, bleh feeling.
Now if only the ulcer like feeling in my stomach would go away.
I hope everyone has a good weekend.

I'm so used to you posting stuff at work on a Saturday and i see NOTHING
Absolutely nothing!
I hope your okay.
The wedding was nice. It was very close to what we'd like to have.
The reception was nice and simple, not overdone and most of the food was appetizer stuff, lots of fruits n veggies.
Lots of freshly smoked salmon and salmon spreads. Total family affair.
The bride and groom were very into eachother. It was rare they werent looking into eachother's eyes.
Stephen took tons of pictures. I didnt know ANYONE cept the groom and that was meeting him briefly months ago.
It was a nice location.
Stephen and i had a spat after the wedding and before the reception so we went on a drive to clear the air.
He went to work after for a few hours.
I treated him to an ice cream sundae. Me a cappucino blast.
Rented some movies and here I am. In front of the A/C with some movies and the new Medal of Honor (rented)
I hope everyone is having a good weekend.
Stephen and I are going to see a movie tomorrow morning/early afternoon if anyone wants to go.
Sorry for flaking today. Plans happened suddenly. I dont know who the hell gives one day notice for a wedding invite *eyeroll*
Cleaning planned for tomorrow. And a quick trip to Sam's for supplies."

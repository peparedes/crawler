"event","so. shows the last two nights, and now a night with absolutely nothing to do. 

i can not wait until thursday, the show should be well worth anyone's five dollars. and the southmorehouse is rad anyways. so it's guarenteed to be good. 

last night was like a nightmare. but it ended alright i guess. heist at hand was fucking off the hook. patterns in movement were actually really good, and the satin hooks did wonderfully. i didn't get to see their set though.  but i could hear it from outside.

i think i am going to book a show with heist at hand soon. so be on the look out for a post concerning it. 

the fight pretty show was shut down by the authorities before mr. electreic was able to play. but <a href=""http://myspace.com/doctordoctor"">doctor, doctor</a> and <b>business lady</b> played, and i was happy to see them both. 

but.

holy fuck. <a href=""http://myspace.com/businesslady"">business lady</a> was a scene from the most gutwrenching horror movie. it was incredible. we're going to tour with them. i swear. 

i miss going downtown constantly these days. and chai tea at deidrichs, and making fun of all of the complete faggots there. i don't miss number's. i haven't been in around... two months probably.

uh. i miss katz."

"event","i don't think i explained enough last entry. i want to be more ellaborate about the way tonight made me feel.  
imagine feeling something real. something tangible, something you know isn't going to turn away, or just abruptly end. simply imagine. it's almost spiritual. it is something deeper than anything i have ever known.

imagine driving in a car, far away from all stress, listening to your favorite song full blast with the scent of evergreen in every breath you inhale. 

thinking about it is similar to staring at the ocean and wondering why something so seemingly endless exists.

i love this. and at ten am tomorrow i will still love this. and everyday from seven months ago to foevere i will love this."

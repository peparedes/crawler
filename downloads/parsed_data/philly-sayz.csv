I'm just going to say that I feel so...Relieved. I finally have my life on course. I'm actually going to do something this time. It's almost set in stone."

I signed up for the YMCA today...The thing is 10x the size of the one in Plant City or Brandon. Hopefully I can start playing basketball again and maybe lift some weights...I ate a LOT today. Gonna go eat some more before I go to sleep...Maybe I'll gain some weight...What an idea!
I've also been thinking about some stuff lately that might inspire a poem some time in the near future! oOoOoOoOo..."

"event","Many of these things I have said already or, at the very least, hinted at.  You were very unexpected and I have come to believe through my life experiences that the unexpected things are the most impacting.  I didn't expect things between us to happen so quickly, comfortably, and with such intensity.  I don't regret anything done or anything said.  I try to live my life in the moment...feelings, thoughts, opportunities.  I have taken every opportunity to be with you and each moment has only brought me happiness.  You make me smile.  Over such a short period of time, I have come to care about you, crave you, think about you, and...I have come to love you.  
I believe everything happens for a reason.  Sometimes that reason is not always clear.  Sometimes reason is confusing.  And sometimes reason is not what we want it to be.  I do believe we were ""meant"" to meet for whatever ""reason"".  In my heart, I don't believe opportunities that we have been granted come along very often...and in some cases...I don't think some are blessed to EVER experience what we have experienced.  What do i believe we have experienced?  Passion, Intensity, open-ness, chemistry, friendship, connection, happiness.  I think many wonderful things ""could"" come out of ""this"".  Many wonderful things have come out of ""this"".  I feel walking away from something soo unique is...well..turning your back on fate.  Yes, I am one of THOSE people.  I believe in fate, past lives, energy of people, and  I believe in synchronicity.  I have some theories I have come to adopt as my ""religion"" I guess you could say.  I believe in energy.  To me, when people are in sync or experience synchronicity...that is life's way of hinting that we are on the right path.  Synchronicity...like well...many things we have experienced.  
Frustration overwhelms me when I feel I cannot communicate the thoughts and images in my mind.  And it frustrates me not being able to help you see what I see.  I was just going to let everything go...for your sake.  I care about you to the point where I don't want to stress you out, I don't want to be linked to anything negative, and I definetely don't want to make you feel guilty.  I am not afraid of rejection or getting hurt.  Pain is something I think is part of growing, and growth is one of my lifetime goals.  I don't EVER want to stop growing.  I had/have so many things to say, and I felt telling you what was on my mind and in my heart would just make things harder.  I felt it would make YOUR decisions harder...and part of me just hoped you would recognize the things I see.  But mostly...I am scared shitless of how I feel.  Like I said I am not afraid of rejection or getting hurt, but I am afraid of the intense feelings involved in this whole situation.  I just don't feel ""this"" away about many people.  This has been a new experience for me...and I am honestly afraid of losing an awesome thing that feels soooo fuckin good.  You feel so good.  Comfortable.  Afraid of losing that connection that might never come around again...
I often think about you and me and things...
I analyze everything from every angle I can.  And in my heart I do understand your thought process as far as Melissa goes...It does make sense that you both love each other and have been friends for a long time.  I also understand why you feel the need to see things through from the ""hormonal"" side of things.  And I do agree that the best relationships are those that have been friendships...first.   Sometimes I feel like you feel you need to hurt her less because...wel maybe because you have been friends for so long.  An obligation to your friendship...admirable.  (I don't want to get into comparing things between her and I...because bottom line I don't think things have anything to do with her.  I actually believe things are based on the situation at the present and the feelings between two people...not some weird triangle...like you said...)
BUT...
YES here are the Buttttttsss....
I also believe that our energies have been here and there before and...we do ""crash"" into energies we have encountered before...""past lives""...some would call it...what I believe is a long explanation, but basically...I feel like you are downplaying the significance of our connection.  Yes you have been friends for a very long time...IN THIS LIFETIME.  but what if?  We have been friends...SINCE THE LAST LIFETIME.  What is friendship?  To me...it is open-ness, kindness, caring, honesty, happiness when you see the other person...and many other things too...what does time have to do with anything?  It seems to me that it is more significant for all of these to develop in a short period of time rather than a long period of time...because I could probably develop all of these things with anyone given a long enough period of time.  I am not trying to persuade you or anything like that...I am just trying to let everything out...so in the end I can say...I let him know how I really felt.  I didn't hide anything.  I was ONLY myself from the very beginning.
I do think it is a huge mistake walking away from me.  Maybe it is an ego thing...you know what they say about Leos.  I just run all the things you have said or hinted at in the past.  ""You make me soo happy...its scary.""  ""I don't think I've ever had this kind of sexual chemistry before."" and blah blah blah.  I think thoughts of...well, what if all this doesn't work out with this other girl?  Could it ever be the same?  Could I ever feel like I wasn't second place?  I try not to play the if game, but i have been playing that game a little bit.
I know everything is about timing?  But who is to decide what is the right time?
I know you hold back from me, with me.  I wish it were different, but that is a gift I would like to be GIVEN.  And I do feel like our greatest potential will only be reached when you don't and I know you do...and we have sooo much potential.  Sometimes I get the feeling that you are afraid to compliment or tell me on your mind.  This might not be true...i don't know.  I just feel sometimes as if you purposefully don't say things out loud...like if you don't say out loud that I make you happy, then maybe it will be less true.  Who knows?  Well I have nothing to hide nor do i want to hide happiness.
There are so many things I wish, but like I said...i do believe everything happens for a reason...and sometimes reason doesn't agree with what we want.  Maybe we are meant to be together.  Maybe we are not.  Maybe you are meant to be with Melissa.  Maybe you are making a mistake.  Maybe I was meant to bring you happiness so you know what is possible for the future.  Maybe you are meant to lose me so when someone else comes along you have already gained the experience.  Maybe I am meant to lose you, love you, forgive you.  Maybe I am meant to learn a lesson of true friendship...wanting the person you care about to be happy...maybe...maybe...maybe...there are many maybe's...but here are the things I KNOW TO BE TRUE...
YOU MAKE ME SMILE.
I CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH I CAN LET YOU GO.
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS COMFORTABLE WITH VERY MANY PEOPLE.
I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF CHEMISTRY WITH ANYONE ELSE BEFORE.
WE ARE CONNECTED.
WE ARE FRIENDS.
I READ YOU WELL BECAUSE WE ARE CONNECTED.
I DO NOT REGRET ANYTHING.
I HOPE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE AS WONDERFUL.
WE HAVE MUCH POTENTIAL.
THIS HAS BEEN INTENSE.
THIS HAS BEEN WONDERFUL.
I THINK ABOUT YOU MORE THAN I SHOULD.
SYNCHRONICITY HAS BEEN ON OUR SIDE.
I LOVE YOU.
--like I said before, I can't just stop my feelings, but I can respect you.  I don't mean to be a temptress...that sounds so weird.  I don't mean to do anything to you that is negative or hurtful.  I know the things that I WISH...
I WISH THERE TO BE NO ONE ELSE.
I WISH THERE TO BE GROWTH.
I WISH THE HAPPINESS TO CONTINUE AND THE PAIN TO SUBSIDE.
I WISH YOU TO RANDOMLY SHOW UP AT MY DOOR.
-----------------
Since the moment I met you...I knew there was something there...
and obviously there is.  You have brought to me many smiles.  I thank you for being beautiful, and bringing beauty and growth into my life. I have ENJOYED every moment with you, and I consider it a blessing to have been able to experience a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity.  You are beautiful and I do not think you are any less beautiful because of...things.  Thank you for catching me off guard and reminding me of what it is like to feel beautiful, wanted, comfortable, good, and most of all..intensely happy.
=====
Miscellaneous thoughts...
I have held back many things for your sake...like telling you all of these things...inviting you over...basically trying to be a good friend.
You talk about this whole timing thing...and how things started to fall in place perfectly on ""the other side""...I don't see how that means things didn't fall into place on this side.
You seem to thing the grass is greener on the other side.
Part of me wants you to stay, but part of me also wants you to go...I wouldn't want you to stay and always wonder what you missed out on the other end because of me.  I wouldn't want you to think I held you back from anything.
I don't see what time has to do with friendship.
I don't understand why a good thing has to end.  It seems to me that the happiness only started to quiver when thoughts of pain of the future were involved.  I don't see what that has to do with the future.
-------------
The bottom line is that i see things from many different points of view and there are many ifs and maybes.  I can only hope that things are or will be in my favor, but deep down inside I only want the people I care about to be happy...As fucked up as it may sound I do want you to experience things on the other end...for many different reasons, but the main reason...I would NEVER want anyone, especially you, to say down the road, ""I missed this awesome opportunity and I regret never finding out what happened with so and so because of Lani.""  That is definitely something I could never live with.  So as much as it may hurt...I believe all my feelings are out even if they are in random spouts.  This has been written over a couple of days and through many different moods...so I honestly don't even know if it flows well.  I can't help how I feel, and although I don't want to make things ""harder"".  I can't act any different.  Part of me wishes things would become fucked up between us so that there is some kind of closure.  I wish you would be an asshole or I wish that I could hate you, but neither one is the case...because you haven't been an asshole and nothing fucked up ever happened between us...things are just ""floating"" shall I say.  And maybe that is a lesson I am meant to learn...how to let go, and come back.  Like I said there are sooooooo many maybes.  But I don't want to hate you, but it is hard.  I don't think I can just stop!  Even though I know how things are.  I have spent my whole entire life thinking too much.  Analyzing things to the point where I have cut things and tore things apart in my head until the thought in my head doesn't resemble what it first was.  And I have learned that I am usually right on when I FEEL my way through things...and my feelings have usually sent me in the right direction(s).  So I don't know if I can just stop.  For me to think about things...like ""am I seducing him""  ""will he think I am seducing him""...it is not in my nature...because I am not a malicioius person and for me even to second guess my actions...well...all I know...is I feel things...and I do and say what I feel...and I will apologize in advance if it causes any sort of grief...I can't stop because it wouldn't be me.  I don't want it to get to the point of...""we can't be in a room together alone.""  I don't think people are meant to plan those parts of our life or to be away from people that make them feel good.  We don't get the chance to experience very many people that make us feel good very often, and I think it is a blessing...a blessing that shouldn't be avoided to such extreme measures.
anways...i believe this is it. 
Written with much love,
Jezebel"

"event","today the first day going longboarding...oh my god the board is soooo fuckin huge i can barely carry it.  actually, my arm doesn't even reach the width i have to carry it over my head...yeah now i know why surfer girls are so damn buff!!!  but i LOVE THE WATER.  I always have.  I wonder what ever happened to me.  I remember always being in the water and at the beach when i was younger.  I remember my dad calling me a fish and brownie because i was soooo black...now i am soooo white...lol.  It is funny how i lost track of the things i really love to do.  When i am in doubt of what i truly love to do i try to think of my childhood and see if i liked to do it then...because that is the things i truly loved to do in my innocence with no other motive but pure joy...like music...i remember my cousins constantly teasing me because i would be sleeping and suddenly wake up and start singing a song on the radio...and they were like weren't you just sleeping?  and you heard that song?  well i did hear the songs i liked in my sleep and i just had to wake up so i could sing along...hehehhe.  and the beach.  i always loved the water.  why did i lose touch with the things that purely made me happy?"

"event","It's funny how everything in my life until now has made sense.  A lot of the times i didn't understand why things happened the way they did or why this person did this or did that.  Like take my exboyfriend, Johann, for example.  Now, that i look back on our situation I see how he played a vital part in my learning process and without him certain points in my life would have never been crossed or maybe it would have took me a lot longer.  I learned compromise.  A LOT OF COMPROMISE!!!  lol.  I also learned the importance of family during the holidays.  He also gave me some backbone.  I always just kind of a softie with things like work.  I would just do my job to the best of my ability and hope that i would get what i deserved.  By meeting him...i became a lot more assertive and i actually learned to get what i want because most businesses are all about money...and they will try to jip you if they can.  I became a very strong person in the work force after meeting him.  I also would not be in school had it not been for him.  I kind of was content working and making money...but when i saw him going to school and enjoying it i wanted to go back.  School was always easy for me...i didn't really have to study and stuff...so it kind of bored me...but i enjoyed learning.  I definetely would not be going to school in New york had i not met him.  I would probably have taken the safe route like all the other Hawaiians i know...and went to the west coast...closer to home.  But him striving for more...made me strive for more...i wanted to be equal...if he could do it then i could do it.  I was just thinking how it is funny the way life plays itself out.  You think a part of your life is so devastating like maybe the month your exboyfriend screwed you over, but then things like that just lead you to a whole totally different world...it is like the bad experiences are testing you as a person and how you react to a situation.  It seems to me to be a portal to a whole new dimension of yourself.  And all in all a month out of sixty seventy years is ...well i am so not going to do math right now...but it is like nothing in the whole span of things.  I truly believe that EVERYTHING happens for a reason.  It might not be easy to accept at the time, but life has a funny way tying knots in the everyday scheme of things and before you know it after a while you look back and realize those knots have somehow made a strong tethered line to your past."

"event","I needed to go to the beach today...so i did.  The water felt so good.  I have always felt a connection with the ocean and i still do.  There is something so powerful yet serene...something so calm and yet vicious.  it was inviting me in today like it knew i needed to cleanse my mind, my heart, and my soul.  Just being in the pristine cool blue waters staring at the vast mountainside that engulfed me...i felt so protected...i felt so at home.  The ocean has been calling my name for quite some time now...and answering it's call...i realize it is the place i need to be in order to grow.  The water clears my head and allows everything to flow.Going to the beach with my friends is one of those moments that are so special and yet it costs nothing, but time...the most valuable thing you could give another soul whom you care about.  Time.  I've realized I have been spending my time carelessly in the past few years of my life.  Spending time on things that will not matter if i were to die tomorrow.  Those new pair of shoes, or nice car, or clothes will not shed a tear if i were to leave this earth...no it is the people that surround me.  Those are the things that i have found to be important and worth my time.  Because those special people are the ones that hold memories of me close to their heart.  And those people are the ones that cherish the qualities that i am known for here on this earth at this time.  And they are the ones who will cry a tear when the earth decides it is time for my soul to be recycled into the stream of all things living.  Yes...time and energy well spent on the souls that have touched me is what i have found to be important."

"event","I wanted to post this because i thought it was really important and relevant to my life and my path i hope i am heading in.
Well, my tutu is in the hospital.  She went to the emergency room yesterday because she had a hard time breathing.  She has been in and out of the hospital for the past year and a half.  She had to have an angioplasty?  i think that is what it is called.  Her heart was so messed up.  All the doctors said she would probably not make it out of surgery, but she did.  They were all so amazed.  She was in pretty bad shape though.  My auntie had to quit her job and stay home full time to take care of her.  She couldn't speak or move or anything.  Actually...she still can't speak (she writes), but she is able to go out of the house in a wheelchair and stuff.  It's so weird because i remember when all this happened i was thinking...wow that came out of nowhere!!!  I kind of avoided the hospital when she was there.  I always avoid hospitals and funerals among other things.  I've noticed that i tend to avoid things...thinking that if i don't have to deal with it or it is not the right time to deal with it then it is just better to know about it but not be engulfed in it.  I need to stop avoiding shit (well the pertinent shit).  I mean there is always things in life that are better to avoid because it is just not worth my time.
Well, anywho...i went to church with my mom for mother's day (mind you i haven't been to church since i was about 16 when my mom could no longer force me to go, but i couldn't say no to my mother on mother's day now could i?).  I got designated as the camera girl somehow.  So for 2 hours i traipsed around church, with video camera in hand trying to capture what i thought was important.  I guess my tutu lady was supposed to show up, but something was happening that was delaying my auntie from bringing her...and everyone prayed.  The answer at church is always prayer...but i do think there is some sort of power in prayer (maybe it is everyone's positive, hopeful energy focused on another...i don't know.
Well, she finally showed up and i went over to kiss her hi (which i must remember to do...being in the mainland i have been accustomed to hugs...now that i am back i need to remember to hug and kiss!!!  cuz it is getting kind of awkward...the locals are like where is my kiss?).
Oh my god when she looked at me I was so ready to cry and i actually did.  In her eyes was something so calm and beautiful.  Without saying a word, i could feel the joy she felt seeing me.  Me?  
Well, throughout the church program i filmed her.  They had a little ceremony because she is basically the ultimate mother of the church (her and my tutu man were the pastors forever).  While filming and watching her i saw something in her with more than my eyes.  It was a really thought provoking experience.  I just kept thinking in my head SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL.  AND I REALLY TRULY MEANT IT WITH ALL MY HEART.  This woman...my tutu...who can't speak, in a wheel chair...and the only thing that really changes is her facial expressions.  I teared a little more...there are probably some of my sniffles in that clip.  Beauty...that concept has been on my mind for quite sometime now.  What is beauty?  And who is beautiful and how do we become beautiful?  and how do we lose our beauty?  
Beautiful is a special word to me.  I don't ever call anyone beautiful unless it encompasses the wholeness of a person.  For example, i might say she's pretty or he's cute, but i never use the word beautiful unless that person is special in my eyes, but even more importantly they have to special in my heart.
She is beautiful and i need to tell her that because i don't think i will get many more opportunities and i will regret not letting her know before the end.
A strong woman she was and always will be.  
I am working on a poem...i will post it soon...about her...because i saw something that day...and it was special."

"event","What I remember from my dream and what it symbolizes...
broom:  time to clean up your act and resolve your past issues.may refer to the female shadow aspect of yourself
bed:  Dreaming of your bed represents your intimate self and discovery of your sexuality. If you are sleeping in your own bed, then it indicates security and restoration of your mind. You are looking for domestic bliss and peace.
woman:  Seeing a woman in your dream, represents nurturance, passivity, caring nature, and love.
children:  Seeing children in your dream means your own childlike qualities or a retreat back to a childlike state. It is an extension of your inner child during a time of innocence, purity, simplicity, and a carefree attitude.
bus:  Dreaming that you are at the bus station, suggests that you have reached some new level or stage in your emotional or physical life.
water:  Hearing running water in your dream indicates meditation, reflection and pondering of your thoughts and emotions.
twins:  One twin means emergence of unconscious material and suppressed feelings, while the other twin represents the conscious mind. 
Hmm???
____________________________________________________________________________________
Went to Pennsylavania this weekend with ASA the band.  It was a great experience...although I felt out of it for half the time.  I think I just have so much on my mind.  It is definetely something I will remember...We went to this coffee/bar house that had a great atmosphere.  There was a woman playing her geeeetar...and she had an amazing voice.  I love to watch people sing.  It was a quiet little place...there was great food, beautiful people, and good times...what more can a girl ask for?  That was probably the best part of the trip except when we got stuck in a traffic Jam...that was a lot of fun...simple fun...the kind I enjoy the most.  
I hit a silent spell in the past 2 days, but I don't think any of da boyz noticed.  It was beautiful there...I could actually sit outside in ""normal"" clothes and enjoy the weather without worrying about it the rain or wind.  It wasn't a bad silent spell...it was just one of those times when reflection seemed a necessity.  I sat outside for 3 (approximately) hours and just stared at the sky.  Does anyone else do this besides me?  
I wasn't much for being in a large crowd for too long had to go outside a crowded bar after awhile, but there was someone I knew out there so I wasn't alone.  ASA is a combination of distinct, unique individuals who have mutual aspects to share and complement each other.  I got a chance to talk with Joe over this trip (the bass player).  He is a nice guy.  I let him read some of my poetry...things that weren't TOO personal because that's only for really special people.  He shared some poems from Rainier Rilke with me.  There was one I really loved that talked about how no matter what we are always in a position of someone leaving.  He shared that because I was telling him how torn I was about leaving Syracuse for Hawaii.  He also read a really long one that I loved too, but I didn't know what to say about it.  I still don't know what to say about it.  I said it was nice, and he was like well it is a little more than nice...i don't know I just wasn't in a really ""open"" mood I guess.  I like Joe, but I still need time to be comfortable on that level.  I need time to reflect on poetry that is not my own in private.  I can't just read something or have someone read something to me and I just reflect on it...well maybe if it is in a one on one situation with someone I am really comfortable.  I think I will read it again.  I was just out of it...you know those times when the best thing to do seems to just stare out the window...I do that a lot...stare out the window...and not really pay attention to what is going on in the car...I just get so distracted with the beauty that is moving past me...the beauty that is moving past me...I think I could use that somewhere.
I leave for home in 5 days...woohoo...boohoo!!! Did I mention torn?  Will be busy.  But that is life.  
People come and people go.  
Memories live when the present dies.  
We all must do the things we must.  
In the future, we never know what lies."

"event","I was just thinking how I leave for home in 9 days.  It is so weird to be leaving.  I feel torn at times knowing I lead two separate lives.  The life I have at home and the life I have here are different yet the same.  I have people that love me, people I love, beauty that surrounds me, and neverending possibilities.  I know that my lives will never fully intertwine, but I hope some time some of the pieces will come together to form enough of a puzzle to see part of the picture.  I am already starting to miss the friends I have here.  I tear just thinking about leaving.  I know it is only 3 months, but there are some people I have met here that I have stronger bonds with than any of my friends back home.  I don't know if it was because there was pressure because back home and can always go back to my family.  I don't know...I don't want to be sad the last week I am here.  But as I pack up my memories I think...of everything that has happened so far and I am overwhelmed with every emotion.  I need to stop thinking about it.  I have finals!!!

The night was filled with silence...it wasn't good or bad, but just was.  A sadness filled my heart...feeling a friend's discontentment...now I need to sleep and hope peace finds me in my dreams.

It is in silence that the soul best expresses itself  
The Mother  
  
With words one can at times understand, but only in silence one knows  
The Mother  
  
Silence: the condition of the being when it listens to the Divine  
The Mother  
  
A hushed heart hears the unuttered word

"event","So last night my friend Shefije and I stayed up to 4 in the morning doing our 20 page report that is due today.  I had 4 cups of coffee which is a lot for me...I felt like killing the irritating girl in the computer lab who would not shut up.  I was cranky and jittery from all that caffeine and it took all my energy to not turn around and be like you have the most irritating voice I have ever heard and you won't shut up.  But it was cool because Shefije was in a great mood and it made me be in a great mood...it was fun and long.  But today I almost didn't go to my zoology class.  I walked in 30 minutes late, but I'm glad I went because I got a good grade on my test...woohoo!!!

But I found something I really liked by Henry David Thoreau:

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, to discover that I had not lived.  I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it be experience, and to be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion."

Sex and beauty are inseparable,
Like life and consciousness. 
And the intelligence which goes
People are like stained glass windows: they sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light within.
 ~Elizabeth Kubler-Ross ~

""Time is too slow for those who wait,
too swift for those who fear,
too long for those who grieve,
too short for those who rejoice,
but for those who love, time is eternity.""
Henry Van Dyke 


I love you, not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.
Roy Croft

""Love is the flower of life, and blossoms unexpectedly
and without law, and must be plucked where it is found,
and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration.""
D. H. Lawrence

""The risk it takes to remain tight inside the bud
is more painful than the risk it takes to blossom."" 
Anais Nin 

""They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.""
Thomas Edward Bodett

There is no remedy for love but to love more. 
Henry David Thoreau 

Whatever is in any way beautiful has its source of beauty in itself, 
and is complete in itself; praise forms no part of it.

A soul that sees beauty may sometimes walk alone. 
~Johann von Goeth ~

Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not.
 ~Ralph Waldo Emerson ~"

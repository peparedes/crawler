"event","I made before on less money and I will make it again.  I like what I'm doing for the most part.  I like all the different projects that I have gotten work on.  But I feel like I'm working in the opposite of common sense zone.  Since the day I started I say left, they say right.  I say black, they say white.  I even took an IQ test tonight to see if I'm as stupid as they think I am and I'm not stupid.  I have to just get out of there.  I feel like I have let everybody down, especially my family.  I can't tell them what went on, they will side with my boss. I'm sure everybody will think there is something wrong with me."

"event","When I started this job, I agreed to the 9pm to 6pm shift.  I did it voluntarily as long as I could get someone to trade with me 2 days a week, so I could go to school in the evenings.  There are 3 shifts I can work and go to school and there is 1 shift that does not accomodate me.  Now I know the world does not revolve around me, but this is my future and the future of my family.  So I may have to make a choice between school and my job, because the people I work are unwilling to give a little.  I may have to give up a really good job, that pays really well.  You see Regina trades with me on Mondays, and Cindy trades with me on Wednesdays.  Cindy annouced today that she can't trade with me next semester.  She says she can't do this.  It's one day a week, she does not have small children.  She a teenager.  But everybody see this as they are doing me a favor.  What if no one would have taken this shift at all.  Maybe everybody should rotate this shift every 4 weeks.  Every weeks mean that I would be late for a class every 4 weeks, but I could do that.  I don't know who to go to.

Part II
I went to my bosses boss.  She agrees with my boss.  Now my boss and I have had some email wars where I have questioned her about things.  At the end of the meeting with my boss and her boss, she handed Penny, email she has saved that I had sent her.  So my shift is going to get changed, and now she going after me, because I went over her head.  
So I need to look for a new job.  Unbelievable!! If I lose this job I will lose, because I stood up for myself.  My boss is a lying, deceitful, idiotic bitch.  See I didn't tell my bos I was going to school during my interview.  And when I told her on my first day of work that I needed to be off two days a week, Oh my god the look on her face.  She let Janet and Cindy choose there shifts, and she said that we would have to see what Regina wanted to do.  Regina started working a week later than the rest of us.  So anyway she told Regina, that because I didn't mention during my interview that I needed schedule considerations, that she would let Regina decide what she wanted to do.  So Regina took 8am to 5pm and said she would trade with me two days a week.  When it came time to actually trade, she said she couldn't do it two days a week, but she could do it one day a week.  So then Cindy stepped up and said she would do it 1 day a week.  So, I decided to rehash the issue to go to my bosses boss, and of course, it didn't work out, and now I will even be in bigger trouble I'm sure.  Because now I have crossed by boss, and now she is out to get me, and I know she is.  I am not wrong about this.  I just want to scream.

P.S. I no longer need to punish, deceive, or compromise myself unless I want to stay employed!!!"

"event","Well it's been 5 months since my last entry, go figure!  I have figured out that this whole world has a superiority complex.  That people need to feel like they are smarter than other people, to make themselves feel better.  I know, I know the technical term is inferiority complex, but I don't see these people feeling that inferior.  I am the oldest person in my most of my classes. I am dealing with a lot of young know it all's.  Anytime I say anything they shot it down.  Sometimes they get little smirks on their faces, like I am to stupid to know, they think they are smarter than me.  Then, on my job, we have to do peer reviews, my peers pick me apart, over itty bitty things.  And another thing on my job is that I have to call employers and talk to HR people to verify information.  Now the HR breed has got to a whole other species, but again it's the I'm better and smarter than you attitude, that I get. There is a company called the work #, that many large employers, such Walmart, Sears, etc, use for verification purposes, I request many verifications from them a day.  Today an HR lady told me very, very slowly, that I need to call a company called the work #, now she talked to me like I was in grade school.  

Also last night in class, I told someone I was going to get a B in another class.  Now Since when did getting a B become a bad thing.  I probably have gotten a lot more B's in my life, than I have A's.  I work hard for all my grades they dont' come easily.  But the smirk on this girls face, well,  I just wanted to smack it off her face.  

So this now brings me to my subject.  Everybody privately thinks they are smarter than everybody else,  Everybody wants to be the wearing the ""I'm with stoopid"" shirt, they don't be the one the shirt is pointing to.  Because everybody is scared, that people are going to know they don't know something.  I don't know how many people that I work with that make the same money, I make, and do the same job that I do, that brag about being a straght A student in school.  Ahh those were the days when it mattered, huh?  RUDE AWAKENING #322 Nobody cares what your GPA was.........(and yes I want fries with that)"

"event","I don't have much to update really.  I finished Biology Lab this week.  I managed to get a B.  It was a hard class, the teacher was an ass, and I'm glad it's over.  I didn't think I would pull a B.  I finished Drama Classics on video,  I should get an A. I finished Internet Applications months ago, I somehow got a B, I was ticked.  Right now, I have an A in Biology Lecture, we are not taking a final, we are just doing quizzes.  I will be finished with the class next week.  But I only have to concentrate on that class right now.   My back was hurting, and I mean really hurting, so I went to a chiropractor, I had a terrible headache as well, and I discovered to vertebrae out of place and a I had a dislocate rib.  So I have been now to the chiropractor 5 times in two weeks.  Maddie got strep throat.  Brianna has a winter formal tonight.  We found here a real cute dress at Kohl's(I Love Kohl's BTW).  I have been so busy this week My house is a pit.  I'm going to apply for the LPN program at the Area Technical school.  I found WU picks people for the RN program strictly by GPA, and the last group they took the lowest GPA was a 3.56.  I think I have a 3.3, so I am going to take classes at WU next semester, that I need anyway, but try to get in the LPN program.  Kaw Area Tech has a bridge program with WU, and if you are already an LPN, they have to accept you in their RN, program.  I would also have to become a CNA, before I can get in the LPN program.  So I have a plan, and it's doesn't matter how I get there, as long as I get there.  
Well I will be posting Winter Formal pictures later tonight.

"event","1. The weird name for the day was..........A mother names India named her child Coreia. (I can't think of another way to prounouce this name to not make it sound like Korea)
Another weird name I have encountered is Daquardi.  I was wondering if this is a cross between a Dacquiri & Bacardi & then I wondered if that was possibly what the mother was drinking the night she was conceived.  Although if people named their kids after things from the night the child was conceived, like were the child was conceived, My son would be named Lay-Z-boy.

2.  I repeatedly had to walk by a box of Krisy Kreme donuts today, over & over & over.  There was still 1 donut in the box when I left tonight.  It took all the will power I could summon to not eat a donut today.  I am proud of myself for not giving in.

3.  There is a bar in Topeka named the Boobie Trap.  I think that would be a good name for a strip bar.

4.  My kids brought home three kitten last weekend.  It's a long story.  But I can't keep them, and I have been trying to think of a way to give them away. I'm thinking about putting a sign in the yard that says, ""Free Pussy"".  But then I might attract the wrong kind of attention.

5.  Eric and I talked on the phone the other night for 2 and a half hours. (He called me) At the end of the conversation, my mouth was so dry, at some point my mouth stopped making saliva.  We have so much in common it's amazing, and we can talk about anything at all.  He's really starting to open up to me.  We are getting very close.  I'm so glad I have him back in my life.  He's is becoming this incredible friend.  I still feel guilty about leaving.  I just didn't know what I had. But I'm glad I have him in anyway I can.

6.  The people I work with are just devoid of independent thought.  They are so serious.  Although the environment is not a tense as it used to be there.  We are all in the same boat right now, and that creates moments of bonding.   Since the Federal Government decided that every person who is receiving medicaid beneifts must provide citizenship & identity before they receive benefits, it has made my job interesting.  We work case until we get to the point and then we pend them for C & I.  It's amazing how many people don't have these documents.  It's amazing how mad people get when we ask for them.  It's amazing what people will send to prove C & I.  We have close to 10,000 apps sitting in pending status.  We have created a new unit to just deal with pended applications. I mean I was joking about a newspaper birth annoucement I got for a 9 year old.  No No we can only accept that if the moon is full during the vernal equinox.  Every other day there is a new email on what we can accept and what we can't. We are just going crazy.  I have made comments, like do you want us to use the clarification, or the clarification of the clarification.  
Well that's all folks.  Have a great weekend!!"

"event","Ok there has been a lot going on this week.  I had 1 quiz, & two tests.  Maddie got head lice.  Last weekend I fixed my washer by myself.  Then, I decided that I would take a crack at the dryer, and I fixed the original problem, but caused another one.  And my brakes were sqeaking on my car, and I  took it to a mechanic, and they fixed the brakes  & charged me $301.33.  But then they told me that my intake gasket was blown & it would cost $917.00 to fix it.  So I discussed it with Eric, and I discussed it with Charles.  They both felt that I could probably fix it myself, and they gave me several helpful tips.  I tried it today, and I couldn't get it.  I did learn some thing.  I learned when it comes to my car, what I am capable of through this little attempt.  At times while I was take apart my car I was crying over it.  I feel pitiful that I don't have anybody to help me with these things.  I should feel proud of myself, that I am so self-sufficient.  But it just makes me sad that I have had to be this way.  And I don't want people to feel sorry for me, and I don't want pity.  I just want someone to share things with.  I didn't for a long time, or maybe I denied it for a long time.  Eric has a great relationship, and his life works for him.  I'm so jealous.  I called today to ask something about the car, and he was picking herbs out of his garden.  I said, ""How Martha Stewart of you?"".  I don't grow herbs or anything.  I killed the last plant I had.  I can do things in this world, but I feel like everybody else has it more together than I do.  I guess I'm moving forward, I have two years of school under by belt, and I'm back in school again.  Maybe I'm just horny also.  Maybe I don't have anyting that a stiff dick wouldn't take care of.  But I'm feeling  sad, even though I have a lot going for me right now.  
Now that I put my car back together, I need to take it for a test drive."

"event","Today I had my saturday class.  It's Internet Applications,  It's 1 credit hour, so I would be 3/4 time & be able to get the full 3/4 time financial aid.  It's for the next 2 saturdays all day.  It could no be more basic.  I decided to go to college at the last minute this year, so I hit the ground running.  I am attending Washburn University, and once again I am going after my nursing degree.  I am taking Biology 101 - Lecture, Bio 101 - Lab for 5 credit hours.  In Topeka, they count my old stuff from like 1992.  But they are still reviewing my transcripts to see what is going to transfer.  Right now, I a provisional student.  God I hope they decided to accept me, since I have been attending classes for a month now.  But on my Colorado transcript, I have not taken any Humanties, except philosphy.  I have to have 9 credit hours of Humanties, and 3 credit hours has to in Art, Theatre or Music.  So to satisfy my Theatre credit, I am taking Drame classis on video.  It's been really fun though.  We have studied the 6 parts to a tragedy.  We had to attend a Washburn Production.  We took our first test, and she let us use our notes, and she let us work in groups.  Part of our test was reciting shakespere.  One person in the group had to memorize, and recite Shakespere to her from list of paragraphs.  So I volunteered, I recited ""Hamlet""..""To be or not to be .....that is the question"".  She said I was very good(I just pretened I was William Shatner).  
So your probably wondering why the subject is titled, ""Aim Low"".  During lunch, I wondered over to the book store.  I was going to get Amanda a WU T-shirt, since her birthday was the 10th.  But they had a clearnace bin of books, and I bought a couple of books.  One of the books is called, ""Aim Low"" by Dave Dunseath.  He says, ""Aiming low is as easy as breathing.  You can practically do it without thinking.  And all the skills required to get there-like quitting or making excuses-take lesstime to learn than you might imagine.  It's just freakin' hilirious.  
Here's a couple more quotes:
""Admit your mistakes and you will mature and grow.  Don't admit then and you might get away with it.""
""When I try to save money, I'm only inviting an unexpected catastrophe that will wipe me out of every dime, I've saved.""
Oh here's a good one from the intro.
""I hate book intros.  It's like waiting in line for the amusement park to open.  Why the park was built, and who inspired it are of no interest to me when I'm fixated on the giant roller coaster just beyond the gate.  Besides, if a book is well written, I don't think it needs an intro......So I wrote an intro.""
And my favorite....
""Wisdom is about acquiring all the knowledge I can, and using that information against people I don't like""
Hmm I forgot to get Amanda her shirt.  I completely forgot.  I suck as a friend."

"event","I recently watch the movie, ""Walk The Line"", and to sum it up it was ""Ray"" with white people.  Ok, Ok, that's going to far, but I didn't like the portrayal of Johnny Cash.  They made him out to be a dumb hick, who kinda accidentally stumbled on to super stardom.  They didn't mention that he was a college educated man, they completely skipped over the college years and the year he spent working in detroit, before joining the air force.  He was a self taught musician, and worked very hard on his music.  While growing up the songs of Johnny Cash were played, and sang to in our house.  I know the critics love this movie, but I just thought they could have portrayed him as more.  This was the June Carter Cash story, how she saved poor desperate Johnny from himself, and she did help him, but I think I remember they both had problems with the pills, not just Mr. cash. They also villified his first wife, because their marriage didn't work out.  The it was portrayed I as a wife would have had a problem with my husband touring with another woman as well.  But she was the bad guy.  I loved Johnny & June Case while growing up and they knew each for close to 50 years and were married for 35 years, and obviously loved each other very much.  I loved every special and show they were one.  I'm just not sure if they did them justice in this story.  Others may not agree with me.  Johnny & June were like many couple that are married for a long time, when one dies the other dies a few month later.  They definantly have earned there place in music history and I am glad they received national attention even though they are both gone.  I'm tempted now to read Johnny Cash's autobiography, ""The Man in Black"" to see what he had to say about his own life."

"event","unless of course I'm the one that is being considered the elder.  

I guess I will start of by saying that I turned 35 this year, and I have been out of work and money has been tight.  I started one job and then quit and just started another job and money has been tight.  So I'm trying to say that I have not touched up my roots in a couple of months and quite a bit of gray is showing.  At 35 over half of my hair is gray, well maybe not half but a significant amount is gray, when not dyed.  I don't know if that was the reason for the comment or not, maybe I'm just starting to look my age.  At my last job I was told I didn't look 35, of course, a guy who was missing half his teeth, who is 25 told me that.  So, today I'm sitting outside for lunch with some members of my training class.  I'm the oldest person sitting there. And some younger girls start talking about sex.  Maybe since I refer to then them as younger girls, I date myself all on my own.  So the GIRLS are talking about sex, and one looks and me and says I need to watch what I'm saying and apologized to me.  And I said, ""Why are you apologizing to me??"", she said, ""Well I was always taught to respect my elders....."" and then she realized what she said and tried to apologize again, and she kept tripping over her tongue.  IT was actually pretty hilirious.  I think one was saying that she was interested in sex until having kids, and the other said she was just the opposite after having kids her sex drive increased.  I told them that 'when you get my age you don't even care anymore'
Regardless........I am dying my hair this weekend."

"event","This was my sociology assignment I posted my serious thoughts on deviance and then post this lighter one on weird laws.  I just know one thing I'm not going to do any drive by milkings in Texas.
When I think about deviance not necessarily criminal
deviance, but what was thought to be deviant behavior. 
I find it funny what was once actually consider
deviance.  Rock and Roll in the 50's was considered
amoral and deviant. Does anybody remember a couple of
years ago when a man had his wife arrested for
adultery??  The law was still on the books and he made
the police enforce it. A neighbor told that in 1965 she
was arrested and spent 10 days in jail for swearing in
public. I decided to look up some other weird laws that
may exist in the United States. In Minnesota, it's
illegal to sleep naked. In Oregon, dishes must drip dry.
In Alaska, you can't push a live moose out of a moving
airplane. In California, Women may not drive in a house
coat.  IN Alabama, it is illegal for a driver to be
blindfolded while operating a vehicle.   Was this
happening so much that a law needed to be passed?? In
Florida, it is illegal to sing in a public place while
attired in a swimsuit. In Texas, it is illegal to drive
without windshield wipers. You don't need a windshield,
but you must have the wipers. Also in Texas, it is
illegal for one to shoot a buffalo from the second story
of a hotel.  And one more from Texas, it is illegal to
milk another person's cow. Anyway, I just thought this
might give everybody a chuckle. As you can see there are
all kinds of things that throughout history that society
has been deemed as Deviant and has led to the passing of
the weirdest laws."

I work in the computer industry, but everytime a new piece software or new piece of technology is put in front of me, I really feel like running and hiding.  

I do customer services/technical support and I have done it for 8 years now.  I have come to the conclusion that ""User's are Loser's"".  I think I am nice person, but suffering from major burnout.  

Okielady and I used to work from the same company and sit right by each other.  We kept each other sane.  We were both suffering from burn out back then.  So I'm like well past my last nerve if you know what I mean.

I keep planning my last day of work in this industry.  Something like answering the phone, ""Anti-helpdesk, What would your whiney ass problem be today? and ""How can I not help you?""  Did you really just tell me how I'm suppose to do my job - - I guess I will let you speak to Mr. TONE...click!

"event","I just got some swank new skate boots which were my size on eBay. Never worn. 

<a href=""http://www.riedellroller.com/boots/911.html"">Ridell 911 Jammer</a> boots
Laser Plates

I was a little nervous they'd be too small or something after I shelled out the $
They were delivered to my work. Our business manager dropped the package off in my office.
I excitedly tried them on. They fit perfect!
I tied them and strapped in the ""speed strap"" (don't get fresh!)
Then I couldn't take the things off.

I googled Riedell 911 Speed Strap and Nothing.
I called Riedell. The first two people I spoke with were super nice, and couldn't tell me how to do it. So I was on the line with someone else and he was telling me what to do but on the phone, you know, you can't see things yet. Videophone is still pretty scarce. And also, not being so bright. Or whatev. 
So anyway, I'm ready to go walking around with one blue roller skate boot with no wheels on it for the rest of the day at work and live with all the embarrassing comments ... I can't decide whether this is funnier or weirder than the time I showed up to work with a black eye. I thanked the guy but admitted I had no idea how he was doing it, because what he was saying to do, didn't make sense. And then finally I got it. Hooray. I've never been more relieved to wear two matching shoes."

"event","We beat the TXRG Hustlers last night. woohoo!
The final score was 89-79. It was a very close match the whole time. Neither team got more than about 18 points ahead at any time. We just worked really hard and stayed focused and came out on top. But it could have gone either way, and I think the fans enjoyed the action.
It was a fun game, those girls were super cool and fun to play with.
And party with afterwards, even in the boring Northeast area.
Plus all the photos are going to look really awesome with our shiny turquoise and purple uniforms glimmering under the lights.
I went to scrimmage practice tonight and I'm exhausted... time for bed.

"event","so the ECDE is over and I am sore. For about 12-16 hours after our bout with Providence on Saturday night I couldn't lift my arm over my head, those girls hit hard! But I slathered up with some weird tiger balm type of stuff and took three ibuprofens and skated three bouts on sunday too. Obviously the toughest bout was the Liberty Belles vs. the RI Riveters -- this was a shitload of fun to play, and we kept it neck and neck with Providence. We were up at the end of the 1st period and then down in the middle of the 2nd. By the end of the 2nd we had caught back up and pulled ahead in the 3rd. Penalties were being called very tight and we had a bunch of players who'd gotten 2 majors already ... there is a new rule that if you accrue 3 majors, you are out for the rest of the period where your 3rd one is accrued. However, they are not reset in between periods! So if you get 1 in the 1st and 1 in the 2nd and 1 in the 3rd, you're out for the game. But if you are getting 1 in the 1st and 2 by the end of the 2nd, you're just out for the 2nd and can play the 3rd. So that probably needs a little tweaking. Anyway, we were pulling our shit together and coming back with a vengeance but I can't deny that when PRD lost Dolly Rocket to her 3rd major in the 3rd or 4th jam of the 3rd period, that gave us an edge. I could have gotten kicked out at any time as well, as I got 2 MAJORS in the first two jams of the game! 

so anyway, we're all exhausted and the weather sucked and what not, but it happened and it was a ton of fun. lots of derby girls made it out and I have tons of new skaters to idolize and a secret crush or two. 

I think the most fun bout to play was the Short Bus vs. the Glamazons. My team, the short buses, was made up of Kandy Kakes (Gotham), Anniechrist (philly), GoldieBoxxx (Philly), Professor Coco A Gogo (Boston), The Ruffian (Dominion), Joy Collision (Charm City), Shay Bay (Big Easy, who we played against Sunday night), Janet Meano (philly), Arial Assault (Gotham) a DC girl whose name I forgot (Harley Quinn?), was I hallucinating or did Surly Temple from Gotham play w/us for a while? It was fun going up against Burnin Helen from PRD, Dutch Oven from Madison (damn girl, you are lethal), Anne Munition? from Windy City, there was definitely a Carolina girl on their team and lots of other great players.

The Broad Street Butchers introduced three new girls on our roster Sunday afternoon, Tara Newone, Leggs Benedict, and Shenita Stretcher. We played against the Baltimore (Charm City) B-team, Female Trouble. Those girls are basically really great players who play against the Maulers for whipping practice and are girls who couldn't play on their travel team for time commitment reasons or because they were too new at the time to be eligible. So we weren't sure if we could pull it off, but we did in the end. I think all the BSB's had the number of Mibbs Breakin' Ribs, 1010 branded backwards on our white uni sleeves... the magic marker wore off on us from her intense shoulder blocks! One of our girls, Derby Sanchez played a great game but twisted her ankle very badly and has a minor fracture. So she will be out of the game for a few months now.

This weekend we're headed to Boston with the Liberty Belles to ring the Boston Massacre. Updates will be posted next wk. Alas, I will not be skating in this bout due to the severe knee sprain/twist I got in Baltimore (I couldn't walk right for a week or so), but I will be managing. It sucks watching everyone else play while your body goes back to normal ... but it looks like the knee is recovering. And there will a great skater subbing in for me to really bring the pain."

There are a lot of similarities, and a lot of differences (1 minute jams, 3 blockers instead of 4 e.g. no pivot)

My favorite addition to the rule is this

3.6.4 - Players must wear underpants, unless they are wearing crash pads which cover their genitals. Thong underwear does not qualify."

"event","So despite the Nor'Easter that whipped up the coastline and dropped about 8-16 inches of snow on our area (and even more up further north) we still had our St. Valentine's Day Massacre bout.

I am so HAPPY that our team, SCARLET FEVER, kicked much butt. We won, 67-52. Right now I am sore and hurting (although not as much as after the first bout or some of our scrimmages) and I have scratches and bruises on my knees, elbows (need new pads, they keep slipping off), forearms and ass, everywhere really ... but it was all worth it, every punch in the chin from Holly Caust and every hard block from Donkey Punch and Honey St. Claire and everyone else and every time I fell down myself knocking someone down or out of bounds, because WE WON WE WON WE WON WE WON, hooray. Finally my team won and our jammers were awesome and our blockers worked well together to kick Black Death's asses. Sorry Mo. 

Thanks to the friends who braved the weather and made it out. Thanks to the Gotham Girls who came down and hung out. Thanks to Dome video for getting the match on video and bringing it to Connie Mac's afterwards so we could watch some of the finer moments. haha!"

"event","I've decided that when explaining the game of roller derby to people, I am going to start using a scene from the Dukes of Hazzard movie as a reference point... 

So - you remember that scene where Bo entered the race late, and he was trying to outrun the cops? And then Luke got in Boss Hog's car with Uncle Jesse and they kept knocking other cars out of the way so Bo could get through? Well - Bo would be the jammer, and Luke would be his blocker - trying to help his cousin (teammate) through the pack of cars and win the race without getting too banged up himself.

Okay well it's a little more complicated than that, being that each jammer has four blockers on their side to try to help them through. And they score points by passing their opposing teammates. 

And you're not allowed to light moonshine bottles on fire and chuck them at your opponents either."

"event","so, we're gearing up for the Hot Rod Hoedown this Saturday... We'll be doing full-contact relay races and blood & thunder. We really wanted to have a match but our refs aren't ready yet... So Blood & Thunder should be fun for spectators to watch, it does involve a lot of knocking each other over. Hope the crowd will enjoy it!

Now that the teams are sort of set, we picked out our theme... we are the Broad Street Butchers. This seemed to combine the needs of some girls to be badass and carry fake cleavers, some to be serial-killer-esque, some to have Philly references in their team name, and others to wear aprons. 

Violet Temper emailed to say our team won 2nd place in the Rollercon Scavenger Hunt. So we win free wheels. Guess we will find out soon what kind they are... 

Rollercon was fun, albeit a little disorganized and hot as ass. Got to meet some awesome folks, see the town a bit, relax in the pool, etc. Tried to scrimmage, went in for two pick-up bouts. Did okay blocking, not as well jamming... the surface was much more slippery than I was used to, (eg I fell right on my ass trying to get up to speed) and when I was done that jam I was super hot. 109 degrees at noon, but some people were saying it was 112 or so in their car thermometers by 2. Went to sit in the shade and drink more water and when I felt ready to maybe go back and try again and adjust more to the surface most people were sitting down. eh well. Violet and I skated to (AND INSIDE) the supermarket across the street for cold drinks and that was heavenly - all smooth and air-conditioned.

I really don't have much more interesting stuff to say."

"event","The first blood spilled on the rink was mine, today, this morning, while Fox 29 News cameraman filmed it. Gori Amos was jamming; Annie Christ was pivot; Mo Pain, Josephine (can't remember her rollername) and myself were blocking. Gori got knocked out of bounds and came back in, so I blocked her at the edge. She fell and then rolled on top of me, pushing my face into the rink... Minutes later blood started pouring out of my nose and I had a fat lip but everything else is fine. A few hours after it happened, the swelling has gone down quite a lot and it's not so bad as it was. I'm getting a doctor to look at it this afternoon; didn't want to go to the emergency room since it wasn't hurting that bad and after the blood stopped I could breathe okay. We don't think it's broken but I'll find out for sure. Everyone was saying really funny shit to make me laugh, but for some reason when people ask ""Are you okay"" it's like when you just broke up and are mostly fine, except when people ask that, and then you get all weird like, uh... and a tear comes out of your eye and you're like, yeah, I'm fine, and then when they look away another tear comes out of your eye or three and you cough to cover up the sniffle and wipe your eye all slyly.

So we were on Fox 29's Good Day Philadelphia this morning, from a little after 6am until 9am. We got some face time, and to do some fun stuff... Hope someone taped it. All my stuff is currently in boxes and disorganized so I couldn't. I thought I was going to skip our big meeting tonight but I'm feeling a lot better now and I might go anyway."

"event","Last night the Philly Rollergirls represented at Vespa Week.
It was kind of a weird event. Wrestlers and live bands. We were asked to heckle the wrestlers and talk shit to them. Of course, the minute any of us said anything slightly R rated, they asked us to tone it down and told us then (not beforehand) that it was for Children's Hospital. I also learned that you can actually get drunk drinking Bud Light. Believe it or not! One of our girls, Donkey Punch, got her breast signed by the Rockin' Rebel. Another girl, Apocalypstick, wrestled the Rockin Rebel and he flipped her around and spanked her. Around 10:30ish, the guys in suits decided the band couldn't play anymore and we had to start getting sobered up. Around 11, they actively started kicking people out, but not before we got some more photos taken in the ring and around someone's hearse.

On Wednesday, Fritz - a member of the coaching staff from <a href=""http://www.bggw.com/"">TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls</a> was in town, and he stopped by our practice to whoop our asses into shape and teach us some stuff. First he kicked a lot of girls asses by making us do this drill, 5 minutes each way, of bending down and touching the ground every time he blew the whistle. (This one didn't hurt me while doing it, I thought it was much more fun than suicides... but I am a little sore now... this could have been due to our practice bout). Then we went over legal blocking moves with a partner and gave each other the type of block he called out when he blew the whistle. One that he showed us looked hardcore and even though it didn't hurt to get it in practice, it always made me both fall and laugh my ass off... the one where you put your arm around the other girl's shoulder, she pulls back and you knee her in the gut. 

After the blocking practice, we had a couple mini bouts set up one at a time and got to apply this knowledge. I got to jam against Violet Temper, and somehow won, even though I slipped and fell by mistake... but then she got stuck in the pack and knocked down. We were both amazed at how much we were shaking during that time, waiting for the whistle and then afterwards you get this crazy rush.

So Fritz told us about penalties, and what is legal for the teams to do to get their girls thru and what isn't... What the jammer is allowed to do to push through and what she could get a penalty for, etc. It was pretty informative. We had a drink with him afterwards and got some business stuff that is very helpful as well. So, yay Fritz!"

"event","sunday's practice was pretty awesome. I know I don't do the absolute perfect stops yet, though it's easy going slow now, just hard when going fast... so the beginning was a little bit boring but then we started practicing weaving and blocking. and at the end we tried running on our toe stops and sprinting ... man doing a t-stop or plough stop is really hard after you're skating your ass off and the smell of burnt rubber was in the air from all of us trying not to hit the wall. I can run on my toestops on my other skates but these new ones are slightly too loose (although not giving me blisters) and I haven't quite got a good hang of it yet. Wonder if I tightened the trucks a little and put some more padding inside the boot it would keep my foot from moving around too much. The trucks on the skates are loose, I can feel them wobble a little. But I kinda like it and am curious to try it out some more... Rolletta Lynn was saying she loosens her trucks up as much as she can without skating crazy because it makes her go faster. So I'm trying to get the feel of this and figure out what I like and what I don't like. Or maybe just a little practice on the kitchen floor would help the toestop running more."

"event","well, i bought my speed skates with some of my tax return money... <a href=""http://www.lowpriceskates.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=518"">here they are

<img src=""http://www.lowpriceskates.com/ProductImages/quad/High_Roller.jpg""></a>

(weirdly enough must have gotten them a couple days before they raised the price, cause I paid less than that including the shipping)

one thing, is that after wearing my other skates, the ROCK boots feel really big on my feet and I bought the smaller size. But I don't think going down a size will help. So I'll see how these do and maybe I might need to put some padding in there or wear extra socks. The black & white 50/50 wheels make people dizzy when they roll... 

After doing a lot of research and asking lots of people questions about their skates, I got the ROCK boots because no one seemed to have any complaints about them at all, and they are reasonably inexpensive and somewhat sturdy. Suzy Hotrod has the <a href=""http://www.lowpriceskates.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=278"">Speed Freaks</a> and said they're really comfortable. The experts say these boot designs are supposed to be cut the same, and if you can find the ROCKS to get them.  I didn't want to be copying people by getting the same exact skate as them.

a bunch of us woke up at the butt crack of early to meet up at the Clothespin near City Hall and hand out papers to passersby as a Philly Weekly/Philly Rollergirls promo from 7:30-9am. While there, we met an old time skater who used to be on the Philadelphia Warriors, her name is Twiggy. She was super excited to hear that roller derby is coming back to town, and gave us a bunch of names of people to contact if we want to try to get a coach from old times."

"event","well the fundraiser went pretty well. Some people didn't think turnout was good enough or that it was as awesome as it should be... but I had a good time playing cheezy hair metal, rawk, punk, and some other random stuffs thrown in... lots of requests ... some cute 23 yr old tenderoni boy wanted to hear the murder city devils at the end of the night, but I didn't have any with me to play for him so we compromised on the Smiths and I played a double shot of ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" (the original and the one in Ukrainian by The Ukrainians which is pretty amazing) and then How Soon is Now. We all danced to that and I played some more random shit. 

So the rollergirls made some decent money and met some hopeful fans and sold some more merch. We couldn't auction everything -- there was not enough time to do it right and it wasn't the exact right space to do this event at the Pontiac. But we sold some stuff and we have more stuff to hang on to for a few months when we try to do this event again in a larger space with more than one bartender. Maybe in the fall around Fringe Fest time or something. Most people had a fun time except their only complaint was that it took 10 minutes to get a freakin' drink!"

"event","the gotham girls roller derby bout was really good. Manhattan Mayhem defeated the Brooklyn Bombshells ... it was pretty close, but Suzy Hotrod was not skating, since her band had their record release party Friday night. The girls were really fun to watch and I got to meet Emma Badapple in the ladies' room (she saw my skates over my shoulder and inquired... I said I was ""in training"") and then Suzy introduced me to <a href=""http://www.rollettalynn.com/"">Rolletta Lynn</a> later (she got there just after it ended), all really awesome chicks. Also a girl from the Rat City was there on vacation, she skates on the Sockit Wenches but I forgot her skate name. We got lost in the Bronx a bit before finding the Skate Key, but once we walked inside the rink was totally effing amazing! Neon lights, mirrored wall, a full-sized large rink and a small baby rink. Lots of seating, lockers, and benches.

Yesterday we skated around the Rock'N'Rods in Wilmington, and sold a few cupcakes and cookies until ""The LAW"" came around and told us we couldn't have a bake sale without an official Food Handling License. okay... so we had to hide all our cupcakes and such in someone's van. We still got to sell our t-shirts, which looked super awesome, and meet a few potential recruits. But the promoters found out this happened and felt bad, so they got us on stage to talk about Roller Derby (in between bands) with the WYSP announcers and some guy videotaped some stuff for some rockabilly website. Then the skies opened up and it started pouring rain, and we decided to take off our skates and head north back to Philly.

I had to work a show today and miss our first closed skate session, so sad, and after packing up a truck with boxes of magazines, I was way too tired to go skating for 3 hrs at the church rink."

"event","So this weekend I again went skating on Saturday at Cross-Keys, which is closing... And then on Sunday at Cornwell's in Bensalem. This weekend was Hellspawn Children on Wheels weekend at both rinks. Casualties everywhere! Small children running out onto the rink with no skates on and in opposite directions of the rink traffic. Well, at least it's good practice weaving in and out. We talked to the speed skating coach at the rink on Sunday. I had skated for four hours on Saturday and wasn't feeling it so much on Sunday, so that was good. The speed skate coach's wife also used to do some skating herself... and they own the shop in the rink. She knows what skates hold together and last long, and which ones are cool-looking but fall apart after a few months or a year or two. She's trying to get us a good deal on good skates. She recommended we get skates with Nova plates because they ""carry you through the curves and corners."" 

When I tried to drive home on Saturday afternoon/eve, the torrential rains made it tricky. So I stopped and bought some wine on my way, but in the 15 minutes I was in the store making my mind up on types/varieties, the small puddle had tripled in size.

I remembered what my friends who got their cars caught in the floods of last September said, they drove slowly. And I remember what my friends whose cars did not get stuck said, they floored it and prayed. So that's what I did, the latter, every time I hit a puddle which might have made my car actually float. Floored it and prayed. The word is if your car starts to float or you get the spark plugs wet, you are SOL. Repairs = expensive if your car is salvageable at all. So luckily I made it home all in one piece.

After that we saw sin city. I didn't drive. Even Delaware Ave got flooded for a while!"

"event","After skating from my apartment to Tritone last night and not falling at all, I rolled right in the door and promptly fell on my ass in front of all the people. At least I got there early and not many folks were there to laugh and point yet. 

So Hot Damn! I forgot how bumpy and stuff skating on regular sidewalks is. And so many tiny rocks and chunks of glass and things everywhere which are tricky to roll over. Next time I think I need to wear <a href=""http://www.rollergirl.ca/usdcart/product_info.php/products_id/43"">a pair of skates like these</a> for the mean pavements of Philthadelphia... I just remember this one patch of slate on my old street that my friend Sue & I used to skate down... And every time we'd go down the street, one of us would hit a bumpity-stickin'-up-part of the slate but we'd already be going fast cause slate is so smooth... And this old guy who lived on our street never got a new car since like 1964, he had this giant ass old car out parked in front of his house all the time, and it's bumpers were solid chrome, harder than all the other metal and rubber bumpers. So one of us would always fall and sometimes crash into the pointy part of the car bumper and I have scars on both my knees from such good times.

Anyway, what I was really meaning to say, was, if I was thinking about getting another pair of rollerblades for outside street skating, would that make me a wuss? Or should I suck it up and wear my pads everywhere and get used to the bumpity crackity pavement?

Last night was really great, the place was packed. Even Toothless George stopped by for a while."

"event","practice this saturday was really good!

Suzy Hotrod from the Gotham Girls came down to teach us some more drills. We practiced our stopping again, and then worked on crossovers. Well I can do crossovers going the one way, but it's harder to do the other way. Still practiced 'em anyway -- this time just going lower and with one leg up in the air etc.

Next we learned how to fall right so we don't get hurt, or minimize our hurt. HA! Watching fully-grown women skate around the rink and fall in front of children (or being one of them) is hilarious. Notice, I never used the word adult, because so far, I feel nothing like an adult. It was so fun skating around, stopping and skidding out on one knee and then getting back up & running on skates all in a quick move. 

So after we learned the right ways to fall and practiced falling around the rink a bit (all padded up of course), we got to practice blocking. Suzy showed us the body block and the elbow block and then we paired off a while, then got into a group and she tried passing us, and then made us try to pass. 

After we finished practice, I stayed a little while to keep working on my backwards skating... Hey, I am getting this! This time I only went up on my stoppers a few times, and actually felt comfortable committing more weight to each foot... my left leg/foot is getting comfortable... maybe in a few weeks I can be like those cool 13 year olds who whiz around the rink backwards crossing over that way. Also, it is hard to do a t-stop when you're skating backwards... Another good thing about skating backwards - it gets you used to looking over your shoulder which is something else i need to get better at."

"event","So we went to this rink in Camden, NJ to check it out last night. <a href=""http://www.millenniumskateworld.com/"">Millenium Skate World</a>. HOLY MAMA!!! It was like stepping inside the set of the movie Roller Boogie, or the video for De La Soul's ""A Rollerskating Jam Called Saturdays"" ... Kind of makes me wish I hadn't stopped skating for a few years and spent more time shooting the shit and learning some tricks like my cousin Bob.

The rink had three main sections ... in the very center were groups of people line dancing on their skates, people practicing their moves and tricks, couples doing spins and dance moves (like Roller Boogie). In the inner ovals were the people who wanted to weave in and out, people who were backwards skating, people who just wanted to skate and dance without going super fast. In the outer ring by the very edge, packs of skaters went around together, shuffle skating together, all in the same groove... some backwards, some forwards. Everyone was so good, they made it look so seamless. If you watched from the snack bar, it looked like people were just dancing around the rink their moves were so smooth! But then I found out they have a SKATE CLUB and travel around to different rinks to skate there, meet new people/see old friends from other towns, and learn new moves.

At the end of the night, the DJ announced that it was Freestyle Skate, and people just went crazy! There were people breakdancing on skates, couples spinning each other around, people doing spins, and one guy who would pose on the ground in a weird position, and then two other guys would take turns jumping over him. Really amazing and cool stuff.

I have been practicing my backwards skating, but I still don't have a great hang of it. I'm getting more comfortable, and now instead of falling, I'm more likely to tip up on my stoppers or spin around when I start to lose balance. It's that left leg of mine, doesn't have the full amount of strength that my right leg does, even though I could skate on just my left leg ... It's harder to weave with the left leg, that's for sure. So this is something I need to practice.

"event","went skating thrice this weekend, to try out my new skates.

new skates = new blisters!

also, they are sooo fast that I fell twice, b/c I was overexcited and lost my balance.

I fell another time, because the derby manager's kid came to practice, he's so fucking cute and small and thinks he's a badass ... first he wanted to race with all of us girls. of course he totally cheated every time! so he ended up ""winning"" (but not against me!) almost every time... then he decided he wanted to try and test our skillz. So he would randomly grab us and tell us he was going to spar with us -- whoever falls down first loses!

he's chasing me and elbowing me but only comes up to my ass, if that! so I don't fall down. but then he grabs my shirt... i skate faster. he has to let go. then he grabs my shirt and gets my bra in there and i can't move and he body slams me and i don't want to hurt him so i fall and he falls on top of me. okay the kid weighs maybe 50 pounds soaking wet so it doesn't hurt at all. but he's all excited cause he won and knocked me down!!!"

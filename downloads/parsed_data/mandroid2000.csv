"event","There are no fairy tales.  I use to believe in them until I realized that they were mainly composed of a very simplistic plot manufactured to showcase moral righteousness, wherein an unethical hag is rolled down a hill inside a spikey barrel, usually into a river for good measure.  The happy ending with the protagonists is universally lacking in resolution and everyone seems to go away unimpeded by the massively fucked up thing that just happened, but it's obvious there is a healthy dose of <i>minutae</i> that goes without mention and is kept secretive but maybe just implied a tiny bit.  

It's sort of like Catholicism, I suppose."

"event","My Tramontina 6.5 qt. Dutch oven arrived for pick-up today, so I made the trip to the Unidentified Circle of Hell (Oakland Walmart) to retrieve it.&nbsp; The UCH was especially torturous on the 4th of July, which I&nbsp;had readied myself to face but still truly was not prepared for.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I picked up my order as well as $100 worth of random other stuff in hopes that I will not have to return to the UCH for quite some time.&nbsp; I made a sort-of impuse purchase of the Neutrogena Total Skin Renewal thingy and refill pads because I've read promising things about it and my skin has been all over the map lately and I&nbsp;have a feeling a good exfoliation would help considerably.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to give in to my inborn female desire for cosmetic products.<br /><br />The Dutch oven looks great, though as the reviews I had read said it's heavier than more expensive models.&nbsp; Still, it was rated very kindly by America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated and short of having to find a new metal handle (I can probably just use a cabinet knob), I don't see much difference between it and my parents' Le Creuset.&nbsp; The Tramontina was $45+tax, which is far less than most Le Creusets sell for.&nbsp; Plus, mine has the advantage of being seasoned with the sweat and tears of slave labourers!<br /><br />Ben and I&nbsp;grilled a lovely beer-can chicken for 4th of July dinner on our 18.5&quot; Weber charcoal grill.&nbsp; &quot;What?!??&quot; you may ask yourself, &quot;how have you done beer-can chicken on that particular grill?&nbsp; It does not fit.&nbsp; The lid would not come anywhere near closing well enough to do this successfully.&nbsp; What manner of wizardry have you performed to allow such a feat?&quot;<br /><br />I obtained three equally sized broken bricks from the backyard.&nbsp; Rocks would also work.&nbsp; Then, Ben started the charcoal chimney, with the usual newspaper soaked in discarded rancid vegetable oil (reuse!) resting beneath to get the coals red.&nbsp; When ready, we distributed the coals around the brick-rocks.&nbsp; We added a scant few more coals on top of the red-hots and let them smolder, than placed a cast iron skillet on the brick-rocks.&nbsp; Beer-can chicken on a beer-can chicken stand was placed in the skillet, and usual grilling was done.&nbsp; <br /><br />After it was clear the coals were burning away, we added soaked wood chips on top of the coals to produce smoked goodness.&nbsp; Because the chicken was so much nearer to the heat than it would be on a grate, I&nbsp;had to wrap it with aluminum foil after about 30 minutes and also added water for steam to the cast iron skillet such that the bird did not dry out.&nbsp; Next time I will do this step at the beginning and then remove the aluminum and brown the skin at <em>the end</em> of the cooking time to ensure the chicken remains moist.<br /><br />For a first try, the results were glorious.&nbsp; The chicken had been rubbed in the BBQ rub recipe from Steven Raichlen's terrific book &quot;How to Grill,&quot; except I&nbsp;had added a bit of ancho pepper for a hint of smokiness and in lieu of hickory smoked salt I sprinkled some liquid smoke on sea salt and stirred that into the rub.&nbsp; I had additionally placed 8 halved cloves of garlic under the skin of the chicken on the breast meat because garlic roasted inside of a chicken is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />Also served:<br />-red cabbage, carrot and jicama slaw in a shallot-jalepeno vinaigrette<br />-steamed fresh green beans<br />-grilled corn on the cob"

Girard reckons that people are essentially sheep-like and will copy one another without much reflection. The theory would also seem to be proved correct in the case of Thiel's virtual worlds: the desired object is irrelevant; all you need to know is that human beings will tend to move in flocks. Hence financial bubbles. Hence the enormous popularity of Facebook. Girard is a regular at Thiel's intellectual soirees. What you don't hear about in Thiel's philosophy, by the way, are old-fashioned real-world concepts such as art, beauty, love, pleasure and truth.<p>The internet is immensely appealing to neocons such as Thiel because it promises a certain sort of freedom in human relations and in business, freedom from pesky national laws, national boundaries and suchlike. The internet opens up a world of free trade and laissez-faire expansion. Thiel also seems to approve of offshore tax havens, and claims that 40% of the world's wealth resides in places such as Vanuatu, the Cayman Islands, Monaco and Barbados. I think it's fair to say that Thiel, like Rupert Murdoch, is against tax. He also likes the globalisation of digital culture because it makes the banking overlords hard to attack: &quot;You can't have a workers' revolution to take over a bank if the bank is in Vanuatu,&quot; he says.</p><p>If life in the past was nasty, brutish and short, then in the future Thiel wants to make it much longer, and to this end he has also invested in a firm that is exploring life-extension technologies. He has pledged &pound;3.5m to a Cambridge-based gerontologist called Aubrey de Grey, who is searching for the key to immortality. Thiel is also on the board of advisers of something called the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. From its fantastical website, the following: &quot;The Singularity is the technological creation of smarter-than-human intelligence. There are several technologies ... heading in this direction ... Artificial Intelligence ... direct brain-computer interfaces ... genetic engineering ... different technologies which, if they reached a threshold level of sophistication, would enable the creation of smarter-than-human intelligence.&quot;</p><p>So by his own admission, Thiel is trying to destroy the real world, which he also calls &quot;nature&quot;, and install a virtual world in its place, and it is in this context that we must view the rise of Facebook. Facebook is a deliberate experiment in global manipulation, and Thiel is a bright young thing in the neoconservative pantheon, with a penchant for far-out techno-utopian fantasies. Not someone I want to help get any richer.&quot;</p>"

"event","I cracked open a two-yolk egg today and fried it.  There's something magical about eating two unborn chickens from a single shell.  Apparently it happens in about 1 out of every 1,000 eggs and with greater frequency in jumbo sized eggs.

""Throughout history and in different cultures, finding a double yolk has been considered to mean anything from an impending wedding to a financial windfall to a death in the family.""

""In Europe, eggs are used to tell fortunes. An egg with a double yolk means an impending marriage, an egg with a dark spot on the yolk symbolizes a bad omen, and an egg without a yolk is plain old unlucky.""

""Venerated as a symbol of life, ancient philosophers saw the egg as a symbol of the world and the four elements. The shell was seen to represent the earth; the white, water; the yolk, fire; and the fourth element, air, was found under the shell at the rounded end.""

""The discovery of a double yolk within is cause for terror or celebration depending on which school of thought is followed -  some say it presages a wedding, others a death. Once the egg is consumed, its shell must be broken up lest a witch use it to gain power over the person who ate from it. A witch might also make a boat from an intact shell, then set sail in it and wreck ships at sea.""

I didn't crush the shell.  Hopefully we don't have any neighbourhood witches here in Alameda, though I do like the imagery of some witch digging through our garbage bins at night, looking for my freak-egg shell."

"event","Another thing that has been bugging me lately are all these &quot;money saving&quot; tips that I keep seeing everywhere.&nbsp; Some of them are actually good ideas and I can see merit in mentioning them, but the majority of the &quot;tips&quot; are common sense and stuff that I've always done anyway because I try to conserve resources and be efficient and not waste money.&nbsp; Are there really THAT MANY people who don't save their leftovers if it's something they can reheat or reuse?&nbsp; Do they need to be TOLD that they are being grossly wasteful by throwing perfectly good food out rather than putting it in a rubbermaid container and taking it to work the next day for lunch?&nbsp; 

This economy is a constant reminder of how much I despise modern society.

I'm watching a morning news show and they just quoted a viewer who says that her family drinks a lot of soda, so they save the cans and take them into a recycling facility for money.&nbsp; That's terrific, but if you really want to save money, why don't you CUT OUT THE SODA THAT YOUR FAMILY DOES NOT NEED TO FUCKING DRINK, YOU DUMB TWAT.&nbsp;

 This country really needs to learn the difference between luxury and necessity, and as much as I don't want another Great Depression, it wouldn't hurt to see a reality check of that magnitude whip this spoiled country in the backside and put things into perspective.

When I mention to others that my parents have a sailboat or that they took Ben and I&nbsp;to Costa Rica, they always give me a look like I&nbsp;must be from a family with money or something.&nbsp; The truth is, my parents live comfortably because they were so good at conserving money.&nbsp; When I was a kid, we had a huge garden that provided virtually all of our produce for the growing season.&nbsp; We canned and froze food, picked berries from the wild, picked asparagus from the wild, made wine and beer, fished and froze extra fish for the future, kept bee hives for honey, made deals with locals for things like maple syrup or apples, shopped based upon what was on sale, sewed clothing or got hand-me-downs or rummage sale deals, and generally learned to do what we could on our own.&nbsp; My dad fixed our cars and did our taxes and my mom repaired broken clothing and baked bread.&nbsp; I was always included and taught, even if I wasn't interested in sewing or car repair, and it was clear early on that I&nbsp;was expected to pitch in with the work. 

It's not difficult to find ways to cut costs, but it does involve effort, commitment, sacrifice, and forethought.&nbsp; For those reasons I do not envision much of a change in the behaviour of most Americans as none of those are typical modern American traits.&nbsp; Maybe someone can come up with a &quot;Money Saving&quot; app. for the iPhone that shocks you when you are doing something dumb.

Another money saving tip just viewed on the news show: stop buying diet/healthy foods!

"event","I know that a few of you on my friends list sew, so I thought I'd ask you for your input about sewing machines.

I'm looking to purchase a sewing machine (either used or new).  I'd like to steer clear of digital  as much as possible because of obvious issues with repairing a digital machine vs. analog or mostly analog.

What I know that I would use said machine for is simple clothing alterations--hemming, taking in or letting out seams, turning dresses into shirts and making simple A-line skirts and the like.  I might need a serging/surging/serger (whatever it's called) stitch option or something close to it for stuff like sewing figure skating leggings or leotards.

I would prefer something that would be capable of basic quilting.  I don't want to make crazy complex art quilts; just normal old patchwork quilting if anything.  This isn't THAT big of a deal but it would be nice if the machine had the capability of producing a machine-quilted bedding piece.

A couple of random things:

-I've never really sewed before.  My mom is, like, ninja master of all things stitched, but I never took much of an interest in any of it when I was growing up.  I've learned tidbits about quilting, cross stitch, embroidery, and sewing but I never embraced those things as hobbies.  Thus, I'm starting at a pretty beginner level though I'm not entirely clueless (I know about cutting on the bias, I have stitched button holes before, I kind of remember how to put a zipper into a skirt, etc).

-I don't want to spend $300 on a machine and find that I don't use it for anything other than hemming pants.  On the flipside, I also do not want to buy a super basic machine for $60 and then find out that I really love sewing and have to spend more money to get a second machine to satisfy my needs.

I want something basic but not so basic that it is restrictive.



I'm also thinking about trying to get my hands on a used band saw.  It turns out that as I age, I turn into my parents.  If I suddenly start reading books about building my own log cabin or sailboat riggings, please administer a good beating about my head and shoulders."

It is just as bad as the first one in which SOMEONE DIES AND IT IS JOKED ABOUT.)"">&quot;I went on a date with myself the other night to SPQR. As you can see below, my first time eating here was a bit somber but not one to let death cast its long shadow on my choices in life I returned undaunted. That last sentence is a little too inflated for Yelp but hey when in Rome......HA! SPQR - when in Rome!! Oh god its so easy. <br /><br />Moving on, if you've ever met me you quickly realize that I like the person I am very much and this evokes one of two responses: One - you like yourself too and we laugh loudly, drink heavily, and make others wonder how we are having such a good time; Second response - you want to punch me in the face because you've got some self-esteem issues and for whatever reason I act as a catalyst for these issues. So the best solution for this unfortunate dichotomy in reaction is to often just go it alone and date myself. <br /><br />So as I sat at the chef's bar area in the back of SPQR and took my time eating ricotta with beets, chanterelle mushrooms with spinach, and fried pig ears with stone ground mustard well I thought a little small talk was in order as the awkward silence that often accompanies dates with yourself was weighing heavy. <br /><br />ME - Hello <br />me- Hello <br />ME - What are you reading? <br />me - a magazine. <br />ME - I'm sorry do you want to be left alone? <br />me - No it's fine. I mean I'm sitting at the bar alone eating dinner, reading a magazine, and perfectly content but I would love to stop enjoying myself and talk to a stranger. <br />ME - A stranger! How dare you! We've been sleeping together for 32 years! <br />me - Oh don't pull that sleeping together line on me again. I was very clear from the beginning that this was going to be an open relationship. <br />ME - (tears start to swell) I just never thought it would be this hard. <br />me - Yeah, well that's your issue not mine. <br />ME - I hate you!!! <br />me - That's fine cause I love myself and don't need your approval to do so. <br />ME - Why do you torture me Peter M???? Just a snippet of your time here and there is all I ask but always with the sarcasm and over compensating with the humor, but you know I can't leave. Oh god why does it hurt so much to love you???? <br /><br />Well, I will you tell you one thing. I am not going out with myself again for a long time cause that bitch has issues and almost ruined a perfect meal at SPQR.&quot;</lj-cut><br />"

I know that it sucks that you messed up on the beam and floor and missed the gold medal in the team final.

They are jaw-droppingly, astonishingly unattractive, and it's not even that they're at the awkward age of 13 *ahem*...16 and they look a bit odd because of it.  They simply have the bone structure and facial features of a beaten and drowned rat in a wind tunnel.

You may not have gotten the gold medal, ladies, but at least when you have sex in the future the other person won't have to keep a bucket at beside the bed to collect the vomit that your face and freakish skeletal body inspire in your partner.

"event","Now that I have a job secured with a normal weekly schedule that includes every Wednesday off, I've decided that I'm going to try to start figure skating once a week.&nbsp; The Oakland Ice Center has daytime public skating and while sharing the ice with the commoners comes with disadvantages, I haven't been on skates since I was 25 and chances are I'm not going to be launching into flying camels for quite some time.&nbsp; I'll be lucky if I can still do a waltz jump or forward cross-overs without tripping and landing in a klutzy heap.

What do skaters even wear these days?&nbsp; God, do I feel old..."

"event","The more that I read reviews on Yelp, the more that I think that I need to teach classes on how to be a human.&nbsp; And live.&nbsp; Doing human things rather than being a spoiled, wilting little cunt who relies on others to do everything for them and is outraged when a fly shows up and has the audacity to land on the lip of a wine glass.

Upon looking at the reviews for the lake near Livermore which we are presumably going tomorrow, I made the following observations:

1) You are complaining about an hour drive from Oakland?&nbsp; Are you fucking serious?!?!&nbsp; I couldn't even go to a decent restaurant for most of my life without driving that far.&nbsp; Grocery shopping took 30 minutes each way.

2) You went out for a day on the lake and you brought Fromage D'Affinois along?&nbsp; I love that stuff but...jesus.&nbsp; Were you going out of your way to be a pretentious twat or does it just come naturally to you?

3) Oh no!&nbsp; You had to pay an additional $2 per dog to get them into the park.&nbsp; How awful that the park makes you pay extra for bringing in a high-speed shitting machine.

4)&nbsp; ""Beer drinking fishermen.""&nbsp; As opposed to what?&nbsp; The straightedge fishermen who go out on the lake not to catch fish but to inform them of their rights as valuable members of the food chain?

My new thing is that, while walking, I go out of my way to not move or slow down for idiots paying attention to their cellphones instead of NOT RUNNING INTO OTHER PEOPLE.&nbsp; It's too bad that I can't line my clothing from the inside out with poison darts.

I told Ben tonight that I will probably become a serial killer in a few more years.&nbsp; He seemed fine with that."

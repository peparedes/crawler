"event","This has been a rough couple of weeks.  Two weeks ago my stepmom called me to tell me Dad was coming home to Anchorage from Seattle.  He was coming home to die because he would not be getting a bone marrow transplant.  The doctors put him through hell while in was in the hospital; they were trying to get at the cancer in his spinal fluid, and they went in through his brain.  So by Friday (I can't remember the date), he had had enough.  Saturday I flew up to Anchorage.  I had arranged to be gone from work for a week.

That first night was difficult.  I didn't know what to expect when I saw Dad.  I tried not to be shocked at how sick he looked.  I knew he was very sick, but I've never experienced someone close to me dying of cancer.  He couldn't sit down or lie down on Saturday night until 5 a.m. because it hurt too much.  Finally, we all got some rest.  Those next couple of days were just as hard on him.  However, by Monday the hospice nurse changed his pain medications.  He was heavily sedated for two more days.  Finally the pain management was in a good balance.  Dad was awake much of the time but not in too much pain.

Wednesday and Thursday were pretty good days.  Dad and I were able to talk a little bit.  He was cracking jokes for everybody, just the usual Sam.  On Thursday, Dad wanted to go downstairs from his bedroom to the living room.  Four of us carried him down the stairs on a sheet while he sat up with his arms around our shoulders.  He was joking that Columbo would find all five of us in a heap at the bottom of the stairs and say, ""Well, that guy wasn't long for this world, but what happened to the others?""  Jerri's brother Mike said that if Dad kept it up, we would drop him because we were laughing.

On Thursday night, Dad died.  I am relieved for his sake that the whole excruciating process didn't have to be dragged out any longer.  And I'm glad for my own sake, too, because that meant I was still in Anchorage when he died.  On Friday there was a private family viewing at the funeral home.  I wasn't going to go inside the room--I didn't go in to see Kristina, and I haven't regretted that decision--but then I did go in to see Dad.  It was weird to see him lying there.  I'm not traumatized, but I think I would have rather stayed in the foyer.  I just think that it's so much more important to be with a person when he or she is alive, and to remember him or her that way.  Dad and I got to say our goodbyes, so I wouldn't say there was a need for closure.

I flew home on a red-eye flight Saturday morning at 1:30 a.m.  Strangely enough, I had misread the dates when I bought my ticket.  I was actually supposed to be there Friday at 1:30 a.m.  I showed up 24 hours late for my flight!  However, the ticket agent was kind enough to book me on the same flights for that day.

I've been home almost a week now.  I had a lot of work to catch up on at Connect.  I'm just finally starting to feel on top of things, but I have a lot of papers to grade this weekend.  Oh, and all day Saturday I'm facilitating and attending a conference in Colorado Springs for family members of suicide.

Andi, who is still hanging in there."

"event","Well, I've gotten through the first two weeks of school.  My sixth graders are totally clueless.  I mean, I know sixth graders live on another planet, but this is unbelieveable.  Oh well, we're all learning here, myself especially.  The seventh and eighth graders are mostly good kids.  I've got a couple of troublemaker boys, but so far, no big problems.

The number of copies I have to run through the Xerox machine is ludicrous.  Teachers (and social workers, and law students) are the enemies of the environment.  I try to cut down on paper usage whenever possible.

My (biological) dad is really sick.  He's at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.  He was supposed to get a bone marrow transplant, but then he got a massive tumor on his spinal cord, the doctors found cancer in his spinal fluid, and he contracted pneumonia (spelling?).  So now no one's sure he'll be well enough for the transplant.  The doctors are radiating and trying to inject chemotherapy directly into his spinal fluid.

My mom and Mike are still doing well in Beijing.  Mom's in Bangkok, Thailand, right now for training.  She tried to find the house she lived in when she was 14, but no luck.  She even took a Thai friend with her to read the street signs.  I'm amazed that Mom remembers her address from that long ago!

Andrew laughs at the name ""Bangkok.""  He's got such a dirty mind.

Speaking of Andrew, no, Bec, we're not back together.  No, I'm not going to run off with him.  But he made me laugh yesterday at a time when I needed laughter by telling me about how his client with cerebral palsy got in trouble for rubbing his crotch and sniffing his fingers.  Which led to a discussion about pheremones and how the whole purpose for mates being attracted to each other's smell is so their kids have healthy immune systems.

Damn!  Six pairs of shoes was my first guess for Meg's shoe pool!  Then I realized that number was already taken.  I'm thinking her mom and I have her pegged.  Because you need an even number of shoes.  And you've gotta have Bourbon Street shoes, traveling shoes, comfy driving shoes, another pair for Bourbon Street that rub blisters in new and different places, what-if-I-see-a-hot-fireman shoes, and the PERFECT shoes in case the mysterious black policeman in Hawaiian shirt is in New Orleans.

I so wish I had a camera phone so you could send me pics of New Orleans hijinks as they happen."

"event","This morning I headed downtown to the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk.  Um...yeah.  Not disappointing, but not as spectacular as the name would have you believe.  I'm sure the Arkansas River is somewhere, running through Pueblo, but this isn't it.  This is a psuedo-river with a psuedo-lake (called Lake Elizabeth because it's on Elizabeth Street).  This is what passes for aquatic entertainment here.  Well, no, there's a reservoir out in Pueblo West.  And the thing is, I'm actually really excited about this hokey Riverwalk.  They have pedal boats!  I've always wanted to pedal around a man-made lake in the middle of a rundown, industrial district, pretending I'm one of the idle English middle-class in a Jane Austen novel!  This weekend they're having the River Olympics and Carnival."

Okay, maybe the mid-twentieth century.  Speaking of living in another century--I saw <i>The Village</i> and liked it better than <i>Signs</i>.

Ack!  School starts August 30!  The 24th if you consider 6th grade orientation, which I must.  I am supposed to be writing my unit plan for the students' first assigned writing piece:  Writing a Personal Research Report.  Like typical Andi, I am edging toward the door, trying not to make eye contact with the Write Source 2000 book and handouts glaring at me from the floor.

I did turn in my American Revolution unit, though.  

I still have no living room furniture, save the very cool coffee table/treasure chest from Albuquerque.  I decided to hang Chinese paper lanterns in the living room, since I have no overhead light fixture.  And I want to hang my Chinese paintings in there, too.  So I'm thinking Asian theme.  How does that fit with the Captain Jack Sparrow wooden chest?  Yo ho ho and a bottle of...Tsingtao Beer?

Andrew is having dinner on Friday with the Mate Factor cult in Manitou Springs.  Mate as in with an accent on the ""e""; that weird tea-like drink.  I've never actually drunk it.  Did I conjugate that verb correctly?  Well, there's this commune that runs the Mate Factor, and everyone has weird names like Pisaket.  Apparently Andrew takes his clients there at least twice a week.  And he is becoming KNOWN.  And somehow he's having dinner at the secret underground lair or what have you.  Perhaps the next time I see him--if he reemerges--he'll be wearing a hairshirt, eating locusts and honey, and calling himself Wxutaca."

Also, I haven't been sleeping well.  The air conditioning stopped working, and the heat is still on.  Nothing you can do about the heat; the people in the bowels of the building turned it on, and they decide when to turn it off.  A bit like living in Snyder Hall in Greeley again, actually.  All this is a drawn-out way of saying it's too hot to sleep.  We've got the windows open, but the construction is neverending (Doozers never sleep).  Again, a bit like Greeley.  We used to have a garbage guy who threw dumpsters around at 6 a.m.

I have no appetite.  I've been drinking chicken broth and munching on slices of ham.  We had an enormous ham in the freezer.  Dad cut it up into chunks and thawed some of it.  Mom and Dad will be eating ham into the Year of the Rooster.

Today Mom and I leave for Chongqing, where we will meet our Three Gorges Dam river cruise ship.  I'll be sure to take lots of pictures.

I had two dreams about Kristina last week.  In the first one, Krissy and I were sitting together on a bus.  First of all, she looked beautiful.  She didn't say much; I did most of the talking.  I knew she had died, but I was telling her not to do it again.  Oh, I also told her that mom and I were sorry, that we loved her, and we understood.  She turned away from me, but she was smiling.

In the second dream, we both had long hair.  I've never had long hair, but when Krissy was twelve or so, she had waist-length hair.  In the dream, her hair looked like that again, thick and blonde.  I was trying to dry it with a hair dryer, and I was combing it out.  That's about it, but it made me feel good.

Finally, I haven't been able to cry much.  I feel tense most of the time.  All of my emotions are boiling up inside me, and I haven't been able to let them out.  I think I'm still waiting for my sister's death to hit me full-force.  Maybe it won't happen like that, but I would welcome a catharsis.  I did articulate some anger at the support group last Thursday.  Mostly I just feel guilt."

It wasn't difficult, actually, since the Burrito Brothers had several flavors of gelato sitting out in their display, pear being one of the flavors.  Mom and I shared a cup on the way to the airport.  Krissy was right:  sheer ecstasy.  Good god, I just forgot how to spell ""ecstasy"" and had to look it up.

We also accomplished our mission of obtaining Cherry Limeade from Sonic.  Is it my imagination, or did the Route 44 get even bigger?  I swear, it was 64 oz!

Kristina's memorial service at Las Conchas (4/25) was beautiful.  I'm really glad we went up there to scatter her ashes; I felt very refreshed and rejuvenated as we were leaving.  Of course, that could have been due to the amusing sight of my mother crossing a stream on a log.  But really, it seemed like what Krissy would want.  We planted a geocache at the top of the cliff.

She's not in the dreams herself, but I dream a lot about trying to save someone.  Last week I dreamt about trying to save someone from flesh-eating pink paint on the beach.  Two nights later I dreamt about Adrian Paul (ehem, we won't get into THAT part of the dream) and part of it was about him trying to save his sister from falling off a cliff and his mother from drowning.  After they died, he got to start over and save them both.  I envy dream people for getting to do over.  

The dream signified not only my regret for not being able to save Krissy, but also my need to shore up my mom right now.  The really cool part of the dream was when Adrian Paul took his mom's hands and they took a deep breath and dived into the ocean.  And then I became the main character, holding my mom's hands as we both kicked hard to swim to a beautiful underwater cave.  The trick was, the only way to get there was to believe we could.  See, our lungs could only just barely hold enough air to make it there, and if we panicked, we would drown.  But we made it, because we had faith we could.  And it was gorgeous, the most beautiful place I had ever seen.  Neither Mom nor I believes in heaven, so for me, this dream signified that we would be okay as long as we had each other.  I woke up feeling peaceful and secure."

They have three days to choose one memory from their lives that they want to relive for eternity.  Then the staff recreate that memory on film.  When the films are screened, the people disappear, getting to take just that one memory with them.  So of course, this film made me wonder, if I had to choose just one memory, what would it be?  I haven't decided yet.  The best thing about the movie was one little old lady who had apparently decided while she was still alive that she would be nine forever, playing in a garden in springtime.

We watched <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>, then we read <i>Return of the King</i> for awhile, but I got angry at the book for dropping a bomb on me...I had the same problem with <i>1984</i> years ago; I threw it at a wall when I read the final line...So then we couldn't sleep, and we talked for awhile, which somehow led to discussion of pancakes.  We decided to go to IHOP at 4 a.m.  After breakfast, I was wired on coffee and tried to convince Bjorn to go to Pike Place Market, where we could try to convince the fish people to let us toss fish.

At one point in the dream, I was standing at the bottom of some bleachers talking to a couple in the top row.  Then over the woman's left shoulder, Allan Peifer appeared.  I blew him a kiss, and he winked and blew a kiss back.  For those of you who don't know, Peifer died the year after we graduated.  I was so happy to see him at the dream reunion because he's the one person I most wish could come to the real reunion.  Then I was talking to Nathan, Allan's best friend.  He said how much he missed Allan, and I told him I had just seen him.  I explained how sometimes Allan appears in my dreams, but at the time, I didn't know I was dreaming.  Then Nathan got happier, and he sort of twirled me around.

After this, the reunion became a Hogwarts reunion, and I was Harry Potter.  Get this, in the dream, Draco Malfoy was my brother and a devoted friend.  I was looking for the Weasleys (Ron, Ginny, and the twins).  The Marauder's Map indicated they were in a tower chamber.  The enchanted clock indicated they were in mortal peril.  So I went to the tower.  Malfoy told me, ""It's bad.  Call me if you need help.""  Posted on the door were these instructions:

Silent Bath Instructions
The baths start at 103 degrees Fahrenheit.  When a sound is made, the temperature of the water increases in an amount proportional to the decibel level of the sound.  (These instructions have been removed to Snape's office).

Right away I knew that my friends were inside, and that they were not privy to information about the baths.  So if they spoke or shrieked, the water would get hotter, and as they screamed for help, the water would boil them alive.  Pretty morbid, huh?  I opened the chamber door, and I saw inside six charred skeletons sitting in bathtubs.  However, I was not all that concerned, because I figured that the skeletons were not those of my friends.  Voldemort had kidnapped my friends and wanted me to think they were dead.

I had to come up with a plan, so I went back to the main hall and conferred with some people.  Ginny came from somewhere; it turned out she had been hiding in a tree and not in the tower at all.  Before we had time to come up with a cunning plan, I woke up.

So now you know the weird workings of my mind."

"event","Wednesday, Dec. 25:  For all I've been saying that I had the misfortune to spend Christmas in Alabama, when the day came, I actually spent it in Florida in a condo on the Gulf of Mexico.  This is infinitely better than Alabama.  I adore the Gulf.  Nevermind that the people who owned the condo were Mike's cousins, whom he hadn't seen in 25 years (therefore, I had never met them).  They were really nice.  It was eerie that Grandma's twin sister was there.  Grandma died last year, so it was weird to see her face and talk to her, especially since I had never met Aunt Dora before.

The food was good, and after dinner, I walked along the beach.  Mom and Uncle Terry went with me.  We saw these strange transparent worms that looked like shreds of Saran Wrap.  When the waves came, they dug under the sand to prevent being washed away.  It was cool.  And these little sandpipers were skittering around, staying just ahead of the water line.  Just being near all that water calmed and refreshed me.  I took my shoes off and walked barefoot in the surf.

So, it turned out to be a good day, albeit unusual for Christmas."

"event","Friday, Dec. 20:  Mom drives me absolutely insane with her housecleaning inferiority complex.  We vacuum the carpet a total of five times to insure that the dogsitters will not think we are slobs.

Saturday, Dec. 21:  Mom and Dad drive me insane with their incessant bickering between Centreville, VA and Atlanta, GA.  I laugh a lot just to keep from blowing up at them.  I guarantee you the dogs are running around with muddy feet to thwart my mom's Martha-Stewart-grandiose dreams.

Sunday, Dec. 22:  We drove from Atlanta to Fort Walton Beach, FL, where I was born!  We stayed in visiting officers' quarters at Eglin AFB, which are really nice.  We saw the hospital where Krissy was born.  I kept demanding to see the water, but it was a no go.  We went over to the Alexanders' house;  they're good friends of my parents.  One of their sons just got back from juvenile prison.  He's in love with Krissy, and he thinks he's the next Eminem.  Woo.

Monday, Dec. 23:  Finally, I get to see the Gulf, although briefly because my dad, for an inexplicable reason, pitches a fit about being on the beach.  Then I find the game Apples to Apples at the mall, so I buy it.  Mom then buys a second copy, so we can give it to the Alexanders.  We head over to their house, and while the ""grownups"" go out to dinner, I entertain the kids.  The girls and I play Apples to Apples while Bryan writes love letters to my sister and plays his rap on the computer.  He's actually a really good kid, and he cracks me up.  I had fun, and I got a piece of authentic key lime pie out of the deal when Mom and Dad came back.

Tuesday, Dec. 24:  All hell breaks loose.  We drive up to Fairhope, Alabama, call ahead to let Uncle Terry know we're in town, and find out that Terry's house burned down that morning.  All the people and animals are OK, although at least one cat took off that morning and hasn't been seen since.  Uncle Jack, who is a million years old and feeds himself through a tube into his stomach, is all up in arms.  Finally they get him out to someone's house.  What blows my mind is that HE DRIVES!!  Watch out, everybody!  Mom and I get a serious case of culture shock because this is the Deep South, and it's a bit like Deliverance down here.  I had this movie-moment with my cousin's four-year-old girl, but it can't be recreated in writing.  Before the day is out, we've gone to Walgreens eighty-three times, manuevered a motor home out to the boonies, captured Uncle Jack's escaped cat, and got Glenda to put on some pants.  Then we had Christmas Eve dinner with other people's relatives, but Mom and I managed to find two other people who didn't know a soul, and we bonded."

Unlike Becca, it's not my dreams I fear but the time between when I lie down and when I fall asleep.  As soon as I lay me down, my brain finds it has all this quiet surrounding it, and it shatters the silence with doubts and criminations.  The night depresses me.  I feel like I haven't lived up to the day's potential.  The morning is no comfort, either.  Come to think of it, I've been having some messed-up dreams of late.  And I don't wake refreshed; rather, I'm as exhausted as when I went to sleep.

Mom hates Christmas.  Just once, I'd like to have a holiday season that lives up to some of my expectations.  Over the course of a year, I forget all the bitching and the grinching and the screaming arguments over the tree, the lights, the stockings, the presents.  Visions of hot chocolate, warm toasty feelings, and memories-in-the-making dance in my head.  It doesn't have to be ""It's a Wonderful Life"" happy or Anne Murray-happy, just a little happy.  But December rolls around, and suddenly we're right back where we were last year.  Tears, broken bulbs, broken hearts, sulking in the bedroom with the dogs (Mom, not me).  And we haven't even tried to put up the tree yet!  Damn it.  Am I insane?  What did I expect?"

It was fun exercising my imagination with the Legos.  I bid on a Christmas basket in the silent auction.  I won it, too.  The wrapping paper alone was worth the price, but it came with all sorts of goodies.  Then I met up with the geocachers.  We swapped lots of travel bugs and put together a new cache that Krissy and I are now responsible for hiding somewhere.  But I don't actually have the cache yet; someone's going to put it in an ammo box first.  Anyway, it was fun.  I met some new, good people.  And more children than I care to count.

"event","The teachers in Issaquah are ignoring the court order to go back to school and are continuing to strike!  Good for them!  I seriously doubt the bastard district is going to give them a fair contract, though.  Eventually the parents will turn on the teachers, and they'll be pressured to go back to school.  Damn...  And here's me, not really understanding where Issaquah even is.

The rental car is a Toyota Corolla.  It's pretty and clean and makes me want to run amok.  Canada, anyone?

I watched the last part of the M*A*S*H finale tonight on FX.  And, of course, I cried.  It always got me that the Korean War lasted three years, and M*A*S*H lasted eleven.

I've been in a pretty good mood these last few days.  I still have moments of self-doubt and loneliness, but what the hell.  I found my little purple friend, and that's a totally random thought.

I sorta feel guilty sometimes getting myself invited to share in my housemates' dinners because I don't cook.  But when they're taking up all the stove burners making rice and potatoes and chicken, it's just so sad to be out there with my pathetic little ramen noodles, competing for space with all that deliciousness.  OK, that little scenario just made me a lot sadder than it should have.  I should go to bed."

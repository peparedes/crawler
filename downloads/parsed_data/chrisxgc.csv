 I know I dont update much. And there is a very good and simple reason for this...Chris Wilson is lazy. What can I say? I admit it. Maybe I should start going to meetings or something to try and help me get over this...
 Yeah. Thats is for me. Enjoy this one. Might not get another one for 389883839283 years or so."

Well the tour started yesterday and it was amazing as usual. It was nice seeing everyone together again. It would have been nicer if there wasnt so much tension in the room. I mean it's like there was a line between some of us. I know that is normal and that is probably how it is going to be for awhile now. I just hope things get better for them. Yeah so. Chris is very tired. Think I might try and get some sleep."

"event","First off I want to thank all of GC's mothers for voting us for Viewers choice. We love our mothers. We know you were the ones that spent all day on the computers and calling in...And we appreciate it. 

All in all the VMA's went well. I dont think we realized how awesome it would be to perform at the big show. Well I know I didnt anyways. It was alot of fun and I hope we get to do it again. 

I got too see Jessie Thursday night. I think I was alittle suprised that she showed up with Nick. But I know what the deal with that is. And I am not mad. Although I wish we could have spent more time together. But even seeing her for a few minutes was good for me.
 
As some of you might know it has been a rough week for us. We lost someone special to all of us, so everything we did Thursday was dedicated to them. Benji even gave a special shout out to the Thomas family....

Well the tour kicks off soon. Hope to see some of you out there. To tell you the truth I cant wait to get back out there. I miss the guys like crazy. I mean sure we see each other all the time but we dont get to hang out that much. But things have gotten a hell of alot better with us, I think that makes us all happy.

Well I am beat.

Well the fall tour kicks off soon and I can not wait. Being on the road is something I enjoy very much. Getting to go to different places and meet different people. Nothing better than that. 

I have everything that I could possibly want right now. I have the best job in the world, and I get to experience all this with guys who are like brothers to me, and I have Jessie..*smiles* What else could I want? 

My updates are so boring I know. I could almost fall asleep writing them. I know I need to sign on more often. Hell I need to sign on period. I havent been online in forever. People probably think I died or something..But nope just lazy.

So, what else is there? To tell you the truth there is nothing else. Just sitting around waiting for a call from Jessie and waiting for the fall. I guess I am going to go and call her. 

Later

Edit: I almost forgot. We are performing at the VMA's Thursday. It should be a fucking rocking performance. Were doing 'The Anthem' and it is going to rock. So check us out"

I miss her. Alot more than I thought I could. It's funny when you think about it. I never thought I would find someone to be with.....Let alone find someone who with one loos could steal my heart and hold it in the palm of her hand. I got all that and more when Jessie and I got together. 

So the fall tour starts soon and I cant wait. It would be nice to see the guys again. I miss them alittle, but dont tell them that. I hope Tony gets better so Mest can come with us as planned. I havent talked to anyone lately so I dont know how he is or anything...Guess I should sign on sometime and find out huh?

Well I was watching MTV the other night and guess what was on....newlyweds....*shakes head* I know whats going on and all but it is still kinda weird seeing her with him and all....

And anyone who knows me knows that is the truth. So the fall tour starts soon and to tell you the truth I cant wait. I miss touring. Miss doing what I love. So now that its getting closer and closer to time for us to go back I get happy. 
I havent talked to Jessie in awhile...I miss her alot. I know that once we start touring again, it is going to make things that much harder for us to see each other. But I guess in the long run thats what love is all about. Making sacrifices for one another. We both have our careers and we have to try and juggle that and a relationship. But when its something you want you can always find a way to make it work. And I want this to work. I think we are going to try and see each other soon so yeah I cant wait.

"event","When I first started GC I had never been happier. Honestly who would not be happy getting to do what they love with four of their best friends that they consider to be more like brothers. When we first hit the stage I swear we made magic together. Fans would literally stop us and tell us how awesome we are  together and the could honestly tell we were a famil. And we were. 
 Time went on and slowly things started to change. When we got done with a show instead of going off together like we used to, We would all go our seperate ways. I know sometimes people do that but for some reason with us it was different. 
 I started seeing the changes myself and was tempted more than once to say something. But I never did. A person can only bottle up so much. 
 I love my bandmembers. All of them. But lately we don't speak to one another. Unless we have to. When before we used to talk all the time and it wasn't a task."

Thats something not many people can do. I have always been kinda shy when it came to woman but with her, I feel like I can be myself. So thats great. I got a tattoo with Paul the other day.

I hate myself for not being around for them when they needed someone. But, I found something special in one particular woman. She knows who she is. She honestly helped make me feel better than I have in along time. We hung out alot while she was here, and I enjoyed spending time with her, getting to know her, and learning new things about myself as well. With the tour being almost over, I dont know what I am going to do with my time. Thought about going and seeing Josh still like I had planned, but right now, I dont know if he wants any company. I felt like I had let him down. Love was so worried about him for along time, and I kinda stood back and did nothing. Thats what Im good for I guess. Letting things happen, and not trying to stop them. Maybe I should have, but what would have happened if I had? Who knows. Anyways, I really like this girl. She makes me smile in a way that no one else could. I feel like I have known her my whole life, and we just finally ""met"". Thats the weird thing, you met someone and suddenly you feel like you have known them your entire life. She is such an amazing woman. With everything that she has been through, she always has a smile on her face. That smile. Wow. There is something about that smile, that makes everyone around her smile too. She is even more beautiful when she smiles. I love that smile. Ok, so Im rambling on and on right now, so you will have to forgive me. I think I am intitled to it. Dont you? *laughs*

I dont know why...but here it is...
<i>Sometimes I wake up in the dark of night 
And in my mind there's a picture of you 
I know someday this dream will come alive 
So for now your shadow will do 
I've never seen your face 
But I know your in my heart 
Maybe someday some place 
I'll hold you in my arms 
I have a gift for you 
Something that I've held on to 
Waiting for your sweet caress 
The ribbon has beed on tight 
For all that I hold inside 
And only you will possess 
This heart of innocence 
I lay my head down on a pillow of white 
Your in the dark I am cradled in peace 
No thoughts from yesterday to haunt me at night 
No tears to dry, no sad memories 
It isn't hard to hold 
And now I'll safely keep 
The strength that's in my soul 
Until you come to me 
[CHORUS]
Every night I make a wish before I fall asleep 
That destiny will take your hand 
And lead you to me</lj-cut>
Thats it for me

"event","Know what I hate? Coming online and reading shit about my brothers. Listen and let what I am saying go into your brain. If you do not respect Good Charlotte as a band then you can not respect me, nor Billy, or Paul. When you openly diss people I care about, I take that as if it were a direct hit on me. Most of the time I keep to myself. I dont like getting into things like this. I had planned on keeping my opinions to myself, but not anymore. I think it is rather sad that you can not keep a man, and yet you still insist that you have to have a man, so you mess with guys that are involved in relationships. What? Do guys need to start wearing tags...Hello my name is Chris I dont like you so back off?
I do not think it is very cool that you ask for an opinion, but are not woman enough to handle the critisizm. If you are willing to dish it out, you should be able to handle it. I have only spoken to you all of 2 or maybe 3 times. But, the things I have heard over and over again, speak so loudly to me, that it it hard to not listen to it. It truely amazes me how you could say somethint about Joel and Benji, then say you dont respect GC but you like me, Paul and Billy. We are like brothers. If you diss one, you dissed all of us. It seems to me as if you are questioning all of GC when you say you dont respect us. Thats fine. We could really care less. I know I could for one. I know for a fact you do not know the meaning of the word love. It is one that should not be taken lightly. It is one that is beautiful and honestly should never come out of your mouth. Love is special. You can not love someone, and mess with other guys too. It doesnt work that way. Sorry to bust your bubble. But thats the cold hard truth. 

So, I met Jess and Love. They are both wonderful women and I cant wait to get to know them better. I think I am going to end this here, because I am still pissed.

Guess I will find out when I get there. 

So, it's been awhile since I have talked to any of the guys. People tend to think just because we are together 24/7 we get to hang out and stuff, well we dont. Its very rare for anyone to see us all together. I miss that. But what can ya do. We all have things we have to do, and we just dont have time for anything else. Hopefully we can hang out sometime when things settle down. If not ya know..it's cool. *Nods*

We know it's thoughtful little things that make our lives worthwhile. Be it just as simple ""thanks to you"". Or someone's a ""friendly smile"". And of course these precious little things dont cost a single penny-- so during these inflated times, I shall use them quite a plenty.I dream, it's something I must do. I learn about my innerself, I must be alone, but never lonely. When I dream, and aim my soal, towards the stars, I am, by far. The richer one. Why not dream---Why not?"

"event","I seriously feel like I am dying. I dont know what is wrong with me, or why I am feeling like this. It just all of the sudden hit me. I know I should have told someone about this sooner, but I didnt want to worry anyone. Thats not my style. I dont like when people worry about me, it makes me feel helpless and I am far from that. It's just this time I cant seem to feel better. *Sighs* Maybe I should break down and go to the doctor. I dunno, maybe I will, maybe I wont. I dont know. Either way I will not stay away from a show. That is all I have. And no one or no sickness is going to stop me from doing what I love. I know Im stubborn, but oh well. I think I am going to go and lie down for awhile since right now it seems like I am the only one on the bus right now. Later.

I know a few of you would and I appreciate that. I am simply in one of my moods and for some reason this time, it is just harder for me to get out of it this time. Hopefully I will soon though, and when I do I will sign my lazy ass on. Until then. PEACE!"

"event","Well it's about that time for an update from ole Chris ( AKA...Fuzzy Wilson). This time however I have alot on my mind. Strange huh? Yeah, I think it is actually. I wonder how many of you will actually read this and reply. It really doesn't matter I guess. I just need to get somethings off of my chest I guess. So here goes. 
 Everytime I turn around someone I know is with someone, or getting with someone. Usually I'm not the type to want someone to be with, but right now, I think I'm slowly getting there. I know they say there is someone out there for all of us, but when do I get my turn? I mean seems like all the guys are happy, and I am happy for them. They are all great guys and I wish them all nothing but the best.
 Anytime a girl or sometimes even a guy would act as if they were interested in me, turned out to be only to get closer to Joel, Benji, Billy, or Paul. *Sighs* It's like no one thinks I have feelings. I'm just the drummer. I'm always hid in the background, but I like it. I don't care to much for all the pictures and all that stuff. I care about the music, and that is what I do. Im not in it to make money, or even get my face all over pictures. I know the other guys have the same reasons as well though.
 *Shakes head* Just once I want to meet someone, who likes me. For me. Not because I am in GC or because I know Benji and Joel and Billy and Paul. Is there someone out there like that???

"event","Ok so I was going to try and make this long meaningful post like some people around here do, but honestly I dont think I have anything meaningful to say. Do I ever? *laughs*. Nah, anyways I am loving this tour. I still say there is nothing better than getting on that stage, and letting your emotions out through your music. It an awesome feeling. One that can't be explained to full detail, unless you know the feeling yourself. I havent had a chance to sign on aim lately, wonder if anyone has missed me. *Thinks* Probaly not, but hey it's all good. I miss talking to the guys though, so I may have to sign on one night and bug Billy. *Smiles* Seriously, man I love ya and I am here for you at all times. Same goes for all my brothers though. Anways, we have a few hours before we have to be anywhere, so I think I might go see if I can catch a few more hours of sleep.

"event","Well today was Mothers Day and I didnt get to see mine. *Sighs* thats one of the bad things about being on tour, you loose touch with your family and such. I did however get to talk to her for all of 20 minutes. It was nice getting to hear her voice on the other end telling me she missed me and stuff. *Smiles* I miss her. Yes, i am a momma's boy. I wont lie. Anyways, were in Florida now and I couldnt be happier. Its so warm and stuff here, makes all the bad things go away. Anyways
Leave me some love guys!

"event","Today started off kinda rocky, then got better as the day went on. I met a cool ass chick named Natalie. Don't act as if you dont know who she is. *Laughs* She rocks. Dont lie. Also talked to another cool chick Britty. I think I am going to like it here *smiles*. As the day went by though something happened and it highly pissed me off. I have never thought violence was the answer. Sill don't. I can understand two guys fighting. I mean it's happened a million times before, and it's bound to happen again. But, you never lay a hand on a woman. Never. You just don't. I dont give a fuck what they said to you or what they did. There is no man that has a right to lay a finger on a woman, unless he is asked to *Winks and laughs* I do not believe in it, and never will. I just got done reading David's post and I could not agree more with him. It literally makes me sick to think there are sick people out there who would do that kind of thing. Those of you that think it's cool to beat on women need to grow the fuck up! Your not cool, your not a man. Your just a sick fuck! Sorry for the language, but it is the honest truth. I think they all should be taken out and beat till they can no longer see straight. If you want someone to beat up, come talk to me. I'm sure something can be arranged. Now, I am pissed off and worried. One of my best friends may do something stupid and there is absolutely nothing I can do to help them or stop them. I know there hurting, I can see it in their eyes, but yet there is nothing I can do. I hate that feeling. I know I can't help everyone all the time, but I cant help but try. And usually when I can't, I end up getting pissed at myself. Thinking there had to been more I could have done to help. I get in these moods alot. Where I will just go off and get in my own little world. Never letting anyone in. Secluding myself. When Im there, everything is perfect, everyone is happy, and I am content. But, I cant stay there forever. Eventually I have to come out and re-enter the real world. it sucks, but that's all part of this life. Oh well. Guess I'm out for now..

"event","<small> I think I am going to steer clear from AIM for awhile. I dont know why I even bother. I know everyone has problems, but it just seems like everyone leaves out Chris. I have feelings too. I know I am acting like a baby right now, but I dont care. I just need time to get my head together, and think about things that are going on with me now. How many times a day do I hear, Chris, talk to me...are you ok man? whats bothering you. Never. I am there simply to listen to what your troubles are. Do I not matter? For awhile I thought I did, now Im not so sure. In the group people have clicks. Benji and Joel...Paul and Billy...Where does that leave me?  On the outside. I need someone to talk to at times. But who the hell cares right? I just blend into the background, only speak when I am supposed to, kinda like one of those trained poodles or something. No one ever asks my opinion, or if I have any say in the matter. Why should they start now. Huh? I guess I'm lucky to get any attention from people at all.

"event","Well, today seemed to be alittle better, for me at least. I did some thinking and was able to clear my head and it felt good. I sat down with a pen and paper, and wrote all the negative stuff down that was bothering me. I didnt realize I had so much stuff inside my head that was actually causing problems for me. I havent told anyone about them, because everyone around here has their own problems, and dont need mine thrown in the midst. Anyways, we have tomorrow off and I think I might go and try to find something to do. Dont know what the guys are doing. Except Joel, I read him and Mandy are gonna hang out. Good for you guys. I guess I will end this here.

"event","Ok.Lately, I have been noticing little things about people, and they are beginning to piss me off. Why is it when someone leaves, you have to leave also? Is there no one else that is special or hell even worthy enough to talk to you? I hate sounding like I am, but I can not hold it in any longer. No one ever listens to me. This is my journal, and I am allowed to say what I want in it. So here goes. I do not know when this all got so out of hand. Not that I talked to the guys much before, but now all there is, is silence. No one hardly ever speaks unless needed. I try and talk to Benji. He will say one word or maybe two if I am lucky that day, then that is the end of it. It seems as if <b> everyone</b> has became that way. That is why I never sign on anymore. What is the point? I try. Sometimes to hard to get people to like me. I know when people think of Good Charlotte, they think of Benji, Joel, Billy, and Paul. You tell them there are 5 members and there like yeah sure, ok. No one knows me. And no one tries to get to know me. I dont know what else I can do. When the people that are supposed to be like my brothers wont even talk to me, kinda makes you not want to try and meet others. Or it does me anyways.

"event","Last night was pretty cool yo. I talked to Paul, Joel, Billy, and Mandy. By the end of the night though, I think Billy was wanting to kill us all. *Laughs* We had him laughing so hard. It was good to see him smile again. Been awhile since I seen that. I havent talked to Benj in awhile. He is always doing something or gone one. I hate not getting to see those guys. They mean alot to me. When I first joined GC, things were I guess weird. But, they are great guys and made me feel at home. Anyways, I guess I'm going to end this here.

Billy I swear I will behave *Laughs*

I know I see them everyday, but it's hard to hang out and talk when you have things you have to do. You have to keep your mind on other things. Not your social life. I miss those guys. Did you all catch them on the cover of Rolling Stone? Awesome article in it as well. I think it is the most in depth article I have ever read about them. It descirbed each of them perfectly. And it let you in on a few things I guarentee not many of you knew. Anyways, I think I did pretty good on this update...Dont you? Billy I signed on and you were no where to be found!"

"event","I've been watching vids on YouTube lately that use some interesting old animation, and I was informed that the people found them on the $1 rack at wal-mart.&nbsp; Well the other day I had a few bucks on me so I grabbed a film.&nbsp; It was called <u>The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird</u>.<br /><br /><div align=""center"">Two lovers in a painting come to life and flee their two-dimensional existence.&nbsp; However, a King from another painting comes to life and makes it his mission to capture the two lovers and replace the real king.&nbsp; The lovers, fleeing for their lives, are helped by Mr. Wonderbird, who taunts and insults the evil king.<br /><br /><div align=""left"">It was actually a nice video- the animation was good, and voice acting was nice, and the plot went along well, giving good time to comedy and drama.&nbsp; When the paintings come alive, it seems it's not due to some act of magic or anything, while never stated, it's implied that the various paintings and statues in the king's bedroom come alive and converse every night.&nbsp; Only this night is different, because the King has painted a picture of himself and put it in the space.&nbsp; <br /><br />A shepherdess and a chimney sweep- who are in separate paintings- come to life first and declare their love for each other, then a statue of a guy on a horse- a greek god I guess- tells them that their love can never be because she is a shepherdess and he is a chimney sweep.&nbsp; I don't really get this, because it's not like one of them is nobility or something and they can only marry other nobility.&nbsp; Besides, it doesn't seem to matter when the painting of the king asks the shepherdess to marry him.&nbsp; He's a creep when he asks it too, so much so that the two lovers figure it's a good idea to flee the palace.<br /><br />So the chimney sweep does something, the lovers escape, and the painting-king leaves his painting and replaces the real-king.&nbsp; The story begins.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that my favorite character was Mr. Wonderbird himself- the box text made him sound like the comedic relief.&nbsp; But he is really the most interesting character out of everyone here.&nbsp; He had clearly made himself the enemy of the king(more on him later) openly taunting and telling the him just how he feels about him.&nbsp; It is implied this is because the king killed the mother of Mr. Wonderbird's children while hunting.&nbsp; Mr. Wonderbird is a handsome bird with a huge wingspan- maybe he's a condor or something?- and he wears a hat.&nbsp; He can speak all languages, he says, and indeed, he seems to be the only animal that can speak English- but for an annoying kitten who gets two lines.<br /><br />You meet the king in the beginning and through narration you learn that no one really cares for him.&nbsp; He's not a very good shot, and he uses trap doors like a normal person would breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; However the movie has barely started when his place is taken by the painting of himself.&nbsp; What could become an interesting little subplot turns into an unnecessary action.&nbsp; The painting-king is shorter, but other than that behaves just like the real-king.&nbsp; At least, I'm pretty sure he does.&nbsp; You really get to know the original very well.&nbsp; But his police force don't even bat an eyelash painting-king tells them that he wants them to devote all their energies to finding the shepherdess girl, which implies that real-king must have these manhunts quite often.&nbsp; Besides, painting-king uses trap doors all the time too.<br /><br />The characters who were most disappointing were the lovers, who pretty much don't do anything once they meet Mr. Wonderbird.&nbsp; Before he met him, the chimney sweep threw a fruit at painting-king and saved one of Mr. Wonderbird's chicks.&nbsp; After that Wonderbird offered his help to the couple whenever they needed it, and I guess the chimney sweep took that be a free pass to do absolutely nothing from now on.&nbsp; And the shepherdess?&nbsp; She's pretty much there for decoration.&nbsp; <br /><br />Where this movie really shines is in the world building.&nbsp; They city where all this takes place is like a steep sided mountain, with many cliffs and plateaus, so there's lot of scenes with the two lovers swinging from a cliff, or descending the wrong side of an elevator shaft, or even going down a whole lot of stairs.&nbsp; That doesn't even explain how beautiful and surreal this all is.&nbsp; <br /><br />The whole movie has this ""antique-futuristic"" thing going on and I really dig that.&nbsp; It's obviously an old film- one website gives it a date of 1953, but other than that you have a monarchy and the policemen carry clubs, and yet the king's personal residence is a castle suspended on a pole above the city, and there's a whole underground portion of the city where people live their whole lives never seeing the sun, plants, or birds.&nbsp; Later on, there's even a giant robot.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are some great secondary characters too (other than those two lovers) such as a blind man with a music box who proclaims better days are coming, and a kitten who falls in love with a tiger who saves her life.&nbsp; Even the bad-guys are fun.&nbsp; There's this one cop with a plaid coat that when he stands in the right way, blends in with the wall, and a cop who dresses up like a cat.&nbsp; I particularly like that the movie gives no explanation for this.<br /><br />But I think my favorite secondary character is the king's puppy.&nbsp; This puppy has to be the cutest animated dog I have ever seen.&nbsp; It's a loose skin type, yet the looseness of it's skin doesn't make it look grumpy at all, and the thing scampers around at will.&nbsp; I really wish I knew how to take some screen shots of this, because it would make it so much easier to show how cute this puppy is.<br /><br />I enjoyed this flick.&nbsp; I believe it was probably a great piece in it's time, but for some reason or another it's simply been forgotten by time, until it was acquired by this company that sold it at wal-mart for $1.&nbsp; If you like a movie for it's characters, then I'd have a hard time suggesting this because three of the main characters are bores and the rest are sort of flat anyway.&nbsp; But if you like interesting scenery and little things that catch you by surprise, then I suggest it.&nbsp; Besides, if you don't like it, what have you lost?&nbsp; One hundred and five cents?<br /></div></div>"

"event","Last night Adult Swim was showing an Xmas marathon of Astro Boy and I caught the first two episodes.&nbsp; I had never even heard of this show before and it was an interesting thing to see.&nbsp; I guess it was a pretty important show in the history of animation.&nbsp; Anyway it reminded me of a few shows today, so I guess it's fair to say it had it's influence.

Powerpuff Girls- Cute hero(s) flying around a futuristic city, fighting monsters bank robbers, robots and big monster.&nbsp; Also, the big robot in the second episode looked kind of like Mojo Jojo.
My Life as A Teenage Robot- Well the style is similar, and it's about a cute robot fighting evil.
Futurama- Okay I'm not serious about this, but in the show there was this class thing with the humans and the robots...anyway Futurama played with that issue a couple of times, usually with Bender getting pissed because the way his friends are treating or something.&nbsp; Okay, whatever, I just wanted to mention Futurama in this post.

In the first ep, a scientist's son dies in a car crash, so he builds a robot that looks just like him, then he get pissed that he won't grow and sells him to the circus.&nbsp; There are a number of questions that boggle the mind.&nbsp; For instance, how can this scientist not know that the robot won't grow when he made him?&nbsp; And once he gets to the circus, Astroboy discovers that he has rocket powered feet and he's pretty good at beating bigger robots up.&nbsp; Why the heck did the scientist put rocket powered feet on the robot that was supposed to replace his son?&nbsp; I mean, the kid in AI didn't have rocket powered feet.&nbsp; In fact, compared to the robots in this show, he'd be pretty useless.&nbsp; 

Actually, there were quite a few AI similarities.

Sometimes I just can't think about these things, and I have to go with the flow.&nbsp; So going with the flow...this was obviously inspired by Bugs Bunny and the like.&nbsp; Often times you see a visual joke...like when Astroboy is fighting the villain of the day, Colossal, and suddenly you see Astroboy riding the other like the horse.&nbsp; It kind of throws me off, really, especially since I kind of feel sad for Astroboy.&nbsp; But I'm not here to criticize, just share my observations.

Not bad, I liked the story and I think I could get into it, but for someone in my generation this is very, very weird.&nbsp; Especially in the scene where Astroboy pulls another robot's pants down and inserts a charger into his plug.&nbsp; I wish that that wasn't as bad as that sounded."

"event","Apparently I'm getting excited about the upcoming season of avatar (already) because I had dream last night where I saw the first two episodes.  They were wandering the sewers where the mutants live in Futurama (guess what I watched before I went to bed?) and in the first episode they were joined by Ozai's Angels and the Freedom Fighters.  Then in the second episode they were still wandering, and Mai was teaching Toph spanish.  She was speaking it fluently because apparently they speak spanish in the fire nation.  I did not know that.  Anyway, a second later Zuko and a bunch of aliens were there, and when Katara saw Zuko, they had a brilliant dialog.

Katara: Remember Zuko: No name calling.
Zuko: Yes.  I know.
Katara: I mean it Zuko!  No name calling!
Zuko: Yes!  I know!

Name calling.  After all their history, Katara doesn't want Zuko to call anyone names."

"event","K...there's changing this place so much.  At least my little used blog isn't deleted...yet

I want to talk about <i>Wishful Thinking</i>.  It's the book I just read, and it's a sequel to <i>You Wish</i> and both these books are about this kid called Benjamin Bartholomew Piff (phew).  Of course, more interesting than the kid is the world he lives in- populated by genies, leprechauns and other creatures.  A world where a factory exists for the soul purpose of granting wishes.  

You may be reminded of Fairly Odd Parents and you might be right, though some things in the books reminded more of Roald Dahl's style.  The story is planned.  The first book showed a map- a map of a territory that was hardly explored.  The second book explores the territory a little more, and I imagine the other books would have the characters exploring these lands further.  

The first is better than the second.  It just seems to have more of a story- more of an urgency.  The character even does that hero clich'e of descending into the darkness and facing his demons.  

You also have better villains.  Thornblood has a nice name and his castle is ok, but he's a clich'e, and fortunately, gone now.  Now we have three villains: a wheeler dealer leprechaun, a lawyer, and a little eleven year old girl who's obsessed with the color pink.  Now when you see the villain of the story speaking baby talk to a big pink dragon, you know you have something special on your hands.

So there you go.  It will never match <i>Gregor</i>, but it is a series that I look forward to seeing the next one."

<lj-cut>

This is how I allegedly get along with my mother.

<i>When Aries and Scorpio form a friendship, they're going to wonder how they ever managed apart. Both love power, and if they learn to cooperate instead of fighting against each other, they can achieve anything they want. Scorpio is more focused and more determined than Aries, while Aries gets things started the way both want. Even though Aries can be fiercely loyal, Scorpio has a deeper and more complex devotion to the friendship.

This can be a very goal-oriented relationship. It tends to be highly passionate and often argumentative, because both Aries and Scorpio have jealous tendencies. Scorpio tends to be more patient, but is also more possessive than Aries. Despite their differences, both love risk and taking chances; this is not a boring relationship! Aries and Scorpio can have lots of adventures together. At times, they can have difficulty understanding each other, because Aries is an extrovert, up front and open, while Scorpio is more introverted with their feelings. Both friends need to meet on neutral ground once in a while and call a truce!

Aries and Scorpio are both ruled by the Planet Mars, and Scorpio is also ruled by Pluto. When two people with Mars' energy come together, it's like two soldiers meeting on a battlefield: They're either allies or deadly enemies. Mars also represents passion, so Aries and Scorpio tend to have an exciting time together. Both meet challenge head-on, so it's normal for them to argue all the time -- making up is actually something to look forward to! Pluto adds an extra intensity to this dynamic.

</i>

I *think* Brendan's a Leo.  This made me laugh non-the-less.

<i>When Leo and Scorpio form a friendship, they often create a vigorous and powerful combination. They understand each other's needs well; Scorpio needs to be respected and desired, while Leo wants to be adored and complimented. They are both strongly loyal, often possessive of one another. Both friends are able to provide what the other needs and enjoy each other's strengths.

Leo likes comfort and luxury, often doing things on a grand scale. Leo tends to be flamboyant, and Scorpio will like that and will be happy to give Leo the audience they require as long as there is equality in their friendship. Leo shines brighter and more insistently, becoming magnificence and luxury personified. Scorpio will appreciate being relieved of any pressure to be in the limelight but will be content to control the fundamentals. Because both Signs are so determined, these friends really need to work to understand and accept each other.

Leo is ruled by the Sun, while Scorpio is ruled by the Planets Mars and Pluto. The Sun is about ego and self, and it radiates warmth and light. Leo indeed radiates this kind of energy and enthusiasm. Mars is about war, brashness and battle, and Pluto is the influence on Scorpio's hidden thoughts. Ruled by the House of Sex, Pluto influences the idea of regeneration and rebirthing that is a constant theme in Scorpio's life. Together, this bounty of masculine energy is why Leo and Scorpio soften their conflicts and sustain each other. The Sun represents life, and Mars and Pluto represent ambition and the unconscious; as long as they are careful to understand each other, their combination is a positive and ambitious one.</i>

And this, this scares the hell out of me.

<i>When Scorpio and Capricorn form a friendship, they can help each other to mature as individuals and to learn the value of a loving connection. Shyness, reservations and distrust of others may dampen the initial impact of this friendship. It takes a long time for this duo to open up to one another and feel comfortable together. However, once they have learned to trust, share and care for another person, their connection will be secure and strong.

Scorpio and Capricorn have a lot to learn from one another, as well as a lot to work through together. Scorpio can learn to cool their heated emotions through Capricorn's proficient and stable behavior. However, this sentiment may also backfire for Scorpio who may become irritated at Capricorn's apparent lack of emotional depth. Capricorn can learn to probe more deeply within themselves and all aspects of life from their more intense friend. Both Signs share a love of committing to a task.

Scorpio is ruled by the Planets Mars and Pluto, and Capricorn is ruled by the Planet Saturn. Mars and Pluto represent aggression, courage, sexual energy, rebirth and renewal. Saturn teaches the great lessons in life -- hard work, diligence, ambition and responsibility. Both Signs combine to form an industrious union bound by Scorpio's fierce emotion and Capricorn's ambitious action. This is a dynamic pair.</i>

Erin, apparently, is attracted to me.  Ahhh, thanks Erin!

<i>When Taurus and Scorpio form a friendship, the result is two signs opposite one another in the Zodiac coming together -- a blending of two halves. Signs in polarity such as these often combine to make a whole, each friend's strengths balancing the other's weaknesses. Signs in polarity often feel a strong pull to one another, and when they are together things can get extreme! Taurus and Scorpio have a great deal in common, but because they both bring such powerful personalities to this friendship, the tone often goes back and forth from enthusiasm to enthusiastic contention!

Taurus and Scorpio enjoy working together toward acquiring possessions: Taurus wants material goods, and Scorpio wants power. Both of these signs are preoccupied with wealth and resources, including inheritances and taxes. They are both passionate about all aspects of life. They complement each other because Taurus is more about the self, while Scorpio is about the immediate group, including family. Additionally, Taurus is more direct whereas Scorpio is mysterious. Because of their differences, both signs can grow and learn from each other -- that is, if they can agree to compromise.

Taurus is ruled by Venus, and Scorpio is ruled by Mars and Pluto. This combination is very intense, thanks to Pluto's influence, but it's a good balance of masculine and feminine energy. The two signs coming together form the basic foundation of human relationships -- Venus' love and Mars' passion. Venus and Mars go well together; Venus is about beauty, and Mars is about passion. Scorpio is intense, and Taurus is attracted to this intensity; in turn, Scorpio enjoys the devotion inherent in Venus-ruled Taurus.</i>"

"event","<lj-cut>I liked the book.  The book was thicker than others but the pacing was faster.  It all happened in a matter of days, and chapters seemed to be minute-to-minute.

I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.  From the first moment the plot was throwing loops at me.  A few things were expected, like Lizzie being the codebreaker and Ripred getting a second scar to make the X, and sadly, Ares' death as well.  Sometimes it feels like an author is setting a character up to die.  

I liked that this book was different because most of the action was based in Regalia.  I am very curious about Regalia and it was cool that they finally stayed there for once.

A line in the prophecy got me thinking, about spilling the monster's blood.  Why?  Because the monster could be anything.  It could be a very big, disturbed creature attacking your city (The Bane) or it could be someone who is a monster because of their actions.  Then this could describe a number of people, among them Solovet, Twirltongue, Sandwich and even Gregor himself (he is the warrior).  I'm not really theorizing here...just pointing that out.

I was surprised to find out about Sandwich.  I always got a feeling this was a peaceful guy, now when I read the book again I'll read his prophecies in a whole new light.  I used to not like him because he liked to torture his posterity, now I just don't like him period.

And then there's that thing Ripred brought up.  It does make sense, especially the way some of the prophecies seem to never play out.  Well, which is it?  Do all prophecies come true or none?  But think how sad that would be if all those English people followed a madman into the underground.  And why did they say they went?  Because he predicted the world would end?  Well, that's nothing new.  Everyone predicts the world will end- and yet somehow it seems to keep on surviving.  

I like how Suzanne Collins left the question open ended.  Everyone who reads Code of Claw will come away with a different opinion, and that's awesome.  

I still think Nerissa is a genuine seer, or at least she has some extra sense other Underland creatures don't have.  I bet she and Twitchtip could have gotten along.  So sad about her.

The book reminded me a lot of <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, which I saw just a few days ago.  This time like year I was comparing UC to A:tLA.  Anyway it reminded me of AQotWF because of the way soldiers in a lot of ways were pawns.  Gregor was a pawn and he left the whole ordeal with emotional scars that would never get healed.  Also, the way Gregor was feeling like he couldn't exist during peacetime.  Sort of like a sequence where the guy went home on leave and he felt like he just couldn't exist if he wasn't fighting.

The saddest part was when Gregor woke up and found Ares' claw attached to his hand.  Yes, I cried.

There was romance in this.  I was surprised that Luxa returned Gregor's feeling.  I imagined Gregor as that stereo type of a knight who loved his queen but would never be loved in return.  But their scenes were cute and sweet and sad because they were acting like people who were much older than them.

Anyway, that's my reaction.  I'm actually a little disturbed by this book.  When it ended, it did not seem like everything was fine.  Sure the Underland was at peacetime now, but I got the feeling that it wouldn't last.  And Gregor and his family would never find peace.  Don't know whether I like this or not."

"event","Like we used too down at NC.  Those were good days.  It's a really annoying urge because, even though it goes away, it's persistant.  The problem is that I'm horribly snobby about the people I do it with.  I'll turn my nose if for a stupid thing like not liking your style.  

Anyway, here's an idea that's been in my head for while.

It's about 4-7 cats living in a suburban/urban area.  They are a mix of feral and house cats.  Anyway, they are all out.  The feral cats are out having a territory battle, and the housecats come along and of course all the feral cats turn on them.  The point is that this group doesn't get along.  Anyway, a storm(oooh sooo cliched) forces them to take shelter in a museum (wtf?) where they see a cat statue.  When, in their fighting, they knock this statue over, they realise a Goddess who acts like she knows them and calls them by the wrong titles.  Then she tells them that ""the evil""(cliches are fun!) is gaining it's strength.  Before the cats can flee the crazy ghost lady, she introduces them to Cat Spirits.  

So basicly, it's a story where domestic type cats transform into the big cats, like lions, jaguars and snow leapards.  

I don't have much more than that.  I'm not sure who or what the villain is, maybe I would know if I were interested in Egyptian mythology.  But they wouldn't even be encountering the villain yet.  First they use their new powers to their own advantage, or try to deny the encounter, or other things.  But eventually ""The Evil"" descends upon their neighborhood and they all realize that they have to come together to stop it.

So, I guess it could be big.  There would be a political system within the feral cats, and some of the humans would be important characters too.  There would be ""The Evil"" as well, whatever that is.

Yeah...that's all I got."

So it's a little less funny now.

Anyway, I figured I'd rant about the warriors books now.

I don't want to read the last one right now, and I am not interested in the third series.  Look, the first series was enough.  It was, it was very cool, a lot of things happened, like a soap opera.  

The best book in the second series was definately the second one, because it was the only one with a POV outside of Thunderclan.  Also, Stone/Storm-whoever was a great character, I ended up liking him a whole lot more than Brambleclaw.  I didn't expect that.  

But of course they weren't really Riverclan because they were half Thunderclan, also they were as far as you can get from the camps.  I don't know if there's something that special about Thunderclan or if there's something in all the other camps the author wants to hide from the readers.

Also, I can't be the only person who finds Squirrelflight reeeeealy annoying.

Finally, wouldn't it be call if there was a crossover of all the books about cats?  Let me rephrase that.  All the good books about cats.  Warriors are included because as much as I critisize them I still love them, <i>Tailchaser's Song, The Wild Road</i> and <i>Varjak Paw.</i>  No, probably a really bad idea, but I'm still in the mood to draw something."

"event","Sometimes, at night, when I have nothing else to do I stay up and I sort of imagine myself writing in my live journal.  I know that I neglect this thing a lot, and when I finally do get to it it's to post a link without any explanation to express excitement because I just read a book or something.  The reason I origonally got this was pretty much to blow off some steam, and I think I did back then.  I'm afraid to go back there and look because I was *such* a teenager.  But now I think I'm a little more balanced and, hell, maybe I don't need the lj for that purpose so much anymore.  Sometimes I do.  And you know, I wouldn't trade this thing.  Sure a lot of people are on myspace but I'm not going to use that blog.  Also, LJ is my start page.

So what was this post supposed to be about?

I drew a picture from Un Lun Dun.  I will have to wait till I get back if I want to scan it because Ma's scanner doesn't work, I don't believe.  That's really the only times that I draw, when I'm writing a story or reading something I particularly like.  I drew something from <i>Otherland</i> too but I'm not too pround of it because Renie and Azador looked really f-d up.  

But I like Deeba.  She doesn't save the day because she's supposed too or because she's qualified or anything, but because she's the only one who can.  That's what a real hero is.  I mean that literally, people who do what has to be done no matter who they are, are regular non-fiction heros.  Oh jeez I'm sounding more cheezy by the minute.  I don't even think I know what I mean.

So what am I doing now?  Reburning these disks.  Because appearently you can't play CD-RWs in the car CD player and what's the point of having CDs if you can't listen to them in the car?  Hell, I don't even know where I'm going today.  I wanted to see Reno 911 but it's not at the flagship yet.  And I could have sworn.  So, just driving for the sake of driving?  That makes me feel guilty.  But I haven't had a chance to drive in a long time.  Like, really drive.  

God Damn it's always so diffucult to find the theatre in Augusta.  With the one in Thomaston it's easy.  Just google flagship.  But the one in Augusta can't decide on it's name.  Is it Hoyts?  Is it Royal?  Here's a damn yellowpages listing.  Because that's what you want.  Doesn't this place have a website?

Well at least I posted more than a sentance for once.  I'm getting out of here."

What started out as an idea for a short fanfic quickly degenerated into an excuse to sketch a bunch of characters in Santa hats.  While I'l waiting for the rest to load, here's a sample of the Christmas love.

That's right, Gregor decided everyone should get into the Christmas spirit- everyone, that is, including Ripred!  The rat doesn't seem to happy about it.

Yes, no one is safe from Gregor's Christmas frenzy, including the Bane!  And it looks like they're throwing a Christmas party in the avatar world too.  Actually, I had to get these too together because, they're the same person!  That is if you ignore the Bane being psycotic and having a fondness for genocide.  Come on, they both have ""Daddy issues"", and they both had mento who tried to turn them good, both the same relative age.

Yes Zuko looks screwed up, it's not like I've ever drawn Zuko before.

Everyone in the Underland has been taking great pains to keep the new prophecy, The Prophecy of Time, from Gregor. Gregor knows it must say something awful but he never imagined just how awful: It calls for the warrior's death. Now, with an army of rats approaching, Gregor's mom and his sister still in Regalia, Gregor the warrior must gather up his courage to help defend Regalia and get his family home safely. The entire existence of the Underland is in Gregor's hands, and time is running out. There is a code to be cracked, a mysterious new princess, and a queen who wants control.

<lj-cut> I'm shocked.  I really didn't think she was going to kill Gregor.  My Greggy.  Gre-go.  I bet it's Sandwich messing with them again.  All the Underlanders are so sure Gregor has to die, but really it's a phrase that is interpreted wrong.  I mean, he wouldn't go ahead and say ""And then the warrior dies!""  No no no, Sandwich is more obscure than that, he likes to screw with people!

It's not my fault!  They said on the news it was going to rain all day and these were the only gloves and hat I had (it was cold, especially with a vid. camera in hand!)  Of course, I could have taken the gloves and hat away after the rain stopped, but I kind of liked scaring the old people in the stores I went to.  Also, I went into the lunchroom and all the guys were winking at me.  Hey, I can't help it if that's the first thing that comes to their minds."

I like Danny Phantom.

Wait, wait no, I love that show.  Hell, it's my second favoratte after GA.  I just love how it has the possiblity of being so angsty, after all, they do fight the dark forces of evil and all that jazz.  But most of the time it's not.  They get a little angsty when they're in a one hour a special but then they go back to, you know,  fighting five year old pirates and hypnotic pop divas all the stuff you love.

So I got that off my chest.  And I'm glad they decided not to cancel it after two seasons.  And I'm bummed that the third season finale is going to be the series finale.  However, at least now BH got a chance to make the season finale instead of them just cutting the line after he went on vacation.

So I wonder if he's going to be a sophomore or what?  Then all the freshman will get off the bus and he'll declare ""I officially hate freshmen!""

Just like I did.  Man, highschool has always been the pits.

But I did draw rats.  Aren't you proud of me?

You have a good voice and I think you will turn in some very good production this semester.  This is a good effort and I have a couple of suggestions for you.  I would like you to be careful not to pause unnecessarily in the copy.  Also, be sure to emphasize the correct words(you emphasized FM over the call letters WHSN).  In addition, be especially not to get too ""sing songy"" in your delivery.  You did a very good job with this- especially for you first recorded spot.

Your read here is very good.  I like your inflection and you really did a nice job putting the emphasis in the right places.

This was one of the best spots in the class this week.  Nice work!

An A.  I knew I could pull it together.  Oh, one other thing.  There is no A+ at NESCom.  That means I got the highest letter grade you can get.  You bet."

Obviously, this is inspired my the black shirt I have with the lacy collar.  I wish I could make this in time but hell, I've touched a needle once in the last four years, I'm no designer.  So I'll just find some pants in an earthy tone that tie at the bottom.  Then all I need is a circlet- those are actually a bit hard to find- a fake sword, and a belt it looks like Luxa would wear.  I've already found the hair I'm going to use.  It's light light blond this time, not white.  I find that the white with the pale make up made it look like I was going out as an old woman."

Eeew!  Squirrel/bat love!

Actually they're supposed to have whole armies behind them, but I love the simple beauty of that shocked squirrel over there and that shocked bat over there.  Now imagine that multiplied by um, several K each each.  And the behind the bat army is a pillar of fire and behind the squirrel army is a forest, I guess.  Also there should be an oak behind them all, and behind the oak is the river thames and the mideival city of london.

Yeah.  If I could draw THAT picture...I'd have a lot of patience."

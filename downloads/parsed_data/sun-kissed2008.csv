<P><STRONG>Anyways, Friday I went to school and it was like so fun. Didn't hardly do any work. Took pictures of everybody.. And b4 I knew it... It was time for the pep rally. Kevin Arrington got&nbsp;homecoming queen(when the boys dressed up)Go Kevin.. lmao... During the pep rally anyways. But SOPHOMORES WON AGAIN... GO US!YAY! Congrats To Amanda Roberts(she got homecoming queen) Im happy for you! Then Britt went to the parade and ballgame with me. At the ballgame I talked to Thomas and Kevin a little.. Then mostly hung out with Britt Keith Cody and Lawrence... I have never seen a halftime show like the one that happened friday night... Tyler Vanover will go down in history.. lmao! He streaked! omg!lol. Then we won the game!yay! Go cubs...&nbsp; --&lt;33</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Today me and Britt went 4-wheeler riding.&nbsp; Then came home .. and got a phone call. My uncle wrecked. He had 2 friends in the car with him and they had to fly the other 2 boys out in helicopters because they were hurt so bad. I think my uncle is gonna be okay. But where they hit so hard the little boy in the back of the car got slammed up in the car when they hit and it broke both of his legs and&nbsp;could possibly&nbsp;be paralized.. Then the other one isn't expected to make it through the night.. He has brain damage and internal bleeding..&nbsp; They suppost&nbsp; to call in a few minutes to let me know how they are all doing .. Im so worried about them... Please pray for them!</STRONG></P>

&hearts;Take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

Chorus:
So take me and let me in
Don't break me and shut me out

I lit my pain on fire
and I watched it all burn down
Now I'm dancing in the ashes
and theres no one else around
Cause I wanna be apart of something
This is just a story of a broken soul

Hook:
As days go by, my heart grows cold
I can't seem let this all pass me by

Chorus x2

I'm burning in the heavens
and I'm drowning in the hell
My souls in a coma
and none of my friends can tell
I'm reaching out of getting something
This is just a story of a broken soul

Hook
Chorus x2

Don't shut me out

Does anyone around me feel the same
Just put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain
Does anyone around me feel the same
Put your fist up and vent your pain

Hook
Chorus x2
Hook
Take Me
Don't Break Me

Well I am gonna go. Leave me some love. I need it. lol

What did I do today?
Oh yea, I remember.. Here goes.
I went to Bullcreek on my 4-wheeler and got a pizza at like 1:00 today.
Came home. 
Went 4-wheeler riding.
Went swimming.
Got cought in the storm.. Shew.. lordy lordy.. 
My life is so boring as you all might have noticed. *haha*
I got home at like 10 tonight, Got online to talk to my *boi*
Wow!Lol.. And now here I am.. What a day.. 
I just realized something.. I love rock music.
I can so relate to the lyrics.. Lol. 

   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
             *Rise Against -- Swing Life Away*

Am I loud and clear or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer or are we just getting more lost?
I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

(Chorus)
We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
I've been here so long I think that its time to move

The winter's so cold summer's over too soon
So let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow
And I've got some friends some that I hardly know
We've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

(Chorus)
We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

Swing life away[4x]

So I can tell ya what I did yesterday!
Well I talked on the phone, Then my cousin Joey came down here to stay a week with me.So we went 4-wheeler riding looking for Brandon, C.J, *&* Robby. 
We rode for 3 hours and still never found them. 
I got really muddy too and I didn't wanna get muddy!lmao!But Ol well I guess! *haha* on me!Later, We went up Robby's, Shot more fireworks?Yep Yep.
One came shooting at me and I was so smart I just sat there... hmm.. *lol*
I was suppost to of been home last night by 9:30... I was only an hour late! 
Oops *my bad* 
Finally I got home.
Then My, Joey and Robby decided to stay in the tent.
Well they got in a huge agruement and I came in the house about 2 last night.
Somehow I got brought into in, and Robby said he hated me and never wanted to talk to me again. :(!
I didn't even do anything. How sad is that!
Well Happy Birthday anyways Robby!
Thats basically all I did yesterday.
Oh yea, and Lindsey.. your not weird for lookin' for famous people... 
I'ld probably be doing the same thing if I was bored and it was 4:30 in the morning. *haha*. Be good...

"event","Well Well Well..Im happy right now, Cuz the guy I love does love me back. At least I know that much!He will always be in my heart.. And I know I am always in his.We will always be close and be there for each other no matter what the problem may be. Its just,sometimes I feel like he is drifting away from me... And the thought of that scares me to death![you kno who you are]! Anyways today I'll probably go 4-wheeler ridin' with Amber *n* them people... lol! Then hopefully get to talk to someone very special!like duh!lol.  Well thats about all I gotz to say for now.I'll write more later!! 



*She's beautiful, I can only try to be.
She's perfect, I can try to learn.
And I won't argue. Just know this.
She likes you, but I love you.
But still, I'll never be as good as her.

*Dear Tummy, Im sorry for all of the butterflies.. But its not my fault.. Its all his.I swear!   LOLZ! *wink wink*

*The worst feeling in the world is loving
someone when you know he doesn't
love you back. Your heart aches every
time you see him, knowing that every
time you look into his eyes to try and
reach his heart, you never will. 

*In every girl's life there's a 
boy she'll never forget &&
a summer where it all began.

*A special smile, a special face, a special someone who I 
cant replace. I love you and I always will. Youve 
filled a place no one else will ~

*it's amazing how u feel about him. . that 
wheneVer ur arOund him. . nothIng elSe 
maTtErs, hOw uR HeArt stOps AnD uR 
left breathless. . and no matter how many 
tiMes hE breAks ur hEart, he alWayS 
seems to put all the pieces back together 
.. . .. That`z TrUe * Love * .. . .. 

*I dO swear thaT i`ll alwAys be 
Here i`d give aNything * anD 
everything i will alwAys care 
thrOugh weakneSs AnD stregnth 
happiness & sorrow for better 
or for wOrse i wilL love yOu 
with * every * beAt * Of * my * heart*

--->Lindsey<--- Hey Girl!I wanna say I HEART YOU!lol. You crack me up sometimes. Thanx for keeping all of my secrets! *wink wink* I gots a lot more to tell you.. Its exciting!lol well kinda.. Anyways.. Im really glad I have a friend like you cuz I can tell you stuff I couldn't tell anyone else! Thanx girlie! I heart you.

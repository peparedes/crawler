Being born on the 12th day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, sometimes ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving - but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well its been a little while since I last
updated..Havent really felt the need to.Im sick which sucks but I've
had a lot of time to think. A lot of things has happend, within in my
family and other things. I dont know where am I going with
this...Lately, ive been lost I guess you can say.&nbsp; Its kind of
scary to think that in a year I will be saying goodbye to all of my
friends and&nbsp; moving on to college. Who knows where i'll be, who
knows where they will be. It breaks my heart to even think about
leaving my friends. Netherless my family. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty, thats how I feel. I can have all the love in
the world from my friends and family but I still feel empty. Maybe its
from what I have experienced 4 years ago. Wow...4 years, I sure do miss
him. I sometimes want to give up, I just want him to walk through my
door and just give me a hug and tell me everythings okay..that hes home
and is never going to leave. You cant always get what you want right? I
guess this is something I wont get. Until we meet again I will have
this emptiness inside of me. I sometimes want to pack up everything and
leave because this place reminds me too much of him. I see his face
everywhere and just makes me want him home more. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be happy..but something is wrong with
me..I find something that makes me happy but still I cant be the way I
used to be. I want to change but I cant or is it I just dont want to? I
dont know, honestly I dont know anymore. My mind is something else let
me tell you. I just want to figure out whats wrong with me so I can
move on and go on with life. Not have to worry about anything. Thats
why sometimes I want to leave, move to Spain and just forget about my
past. But my past has so many great memories, minus the grey areas that
I really cant remember and choose not to. Anyways, Im about to pass
out. Bye.<br>
<br>
P.S. This is to everyone who has supported me through out the toughest
years of my life. Everytime I look at myself and they way Ive turned
out I thank God that I have friends like you. I honestly couldnt hve
dont it without you guys. I love you so much. <br>"

be this way. I cant sleep at night, I cry constanly..although I hide it

Im so unhappy right now, when I should be...I guess...I dont

"event","Well, I just got back from vacation yesturday. Thank goodness we beat the storm and didnt have to stay an extra day, I mean it would have been nice to stay but I needed to come back home.Tortola(if any of you dont know where that is, its in the British Virgin Islands) was amazing, our hotel room was right on the beach, very relaxing. I truely needed to get away for a week. I had a lot of time to think things through with everything that is going on in my life. I realized that things happen for a reason, and if it is meant to the be that way then it is. There is no erasing the past and there is no turning back time to fix things. We do certain things for a reason, that reason will lead us to many different things that will be good for us in the end. I used to hang onto things that I wished would never change or leave, but I feel that it is time to let things go. There is this saying"" If you truely love something let it go, and if  it comes back its yours and if it doesnt then it never was"". I finally understand the true meaning to that. If something is meant to happen a certain way then I have to let it happen, I cant do anything to change fate. I dont know where I am going with this.I guess all this comes from reading the book The Notebook. I read it over vacation and it has opened my eyes to a lot of different things. I feel rejuvenated after this getaway.Arite well I am going to go before I get all emotional. Peace out cub scouts=)"

laughs..Good times..and then Saturday the girls came over and we
watched The Notebook and cried our eyes out. I was miserable becuase I
want to be like the couple in the movie. It was just so moving, and
everytime I think about it I start to cry..Hmm Sunday my mom came home
from not being home for the longest time..and now we are planning to go
St.Thomas next week on a mother-daughter bonding trip. We havent had
one in a long time so it will be nice to do that, and to get away from
the cold!Anyways..I hope everyone Valentines Day was grand..Mine was
okaay..My family had a traditional Spanish evening, It was so nice..We
danced to salsa music and ate really good food..I know the dancing
sounds kind of dorky but its a spanish thing lol. I really want to get
in touch with my Latin roots. I would actually like to spend 3 weeks
with my cousin in Spain, so I can get a taste of the culture..Last time
I was in Spain I was 10 so I couldnt really absorb the culture. But
anywho..I am waiting for Lena to get home so we can go get some

The chills crawl down my spin to my toes<br>
My lips quiver when your hand touches my face<br>

This feeling is taking over my <span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">soul</span><br>

My heart beats faster as you walk through those doors<br>
My heart no longer cries at the midnight moon, <br>
because you are here with me now<br>
My heart can finally feel after being so numb for so long<br>
<br>
This feeling is taking over my <span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">mind</span><br>

"event","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Grandma arrived today from Venezuela
so Im really happy. I love having my grandma because she makes really
good food and she just loves me..Hmm I have a stupid monologue due on
wednesday and I have the worst stage fright..greaattt...Anyways sitting
here doing some homework..Oddd I know.Ive had a lot of time to think
about everything..Yea everything doesnt go the way I planned it..but I
believe in fate and I believe that things happen for a reason. If its
not meant to be then its not. I guess I will have to deal with that
sooner or later. Today we had a discussion of fate in English, and I
truely believe in it. Maybe not everything it fate but I believe that
life is sort of planned out. Somethings fail for a reason maybe to make
you stronger or make you take a follow a different path. I have failed
at somethings and it has led me to a different path. I just hope that
the path I take is the right one. Ive been lost lately with everything
that is going on my in my life. I dont know if what I am doing is the
right thing, I just wish someone could come up to me and tell me that
what Im doing is the wrong thing that I am supposed to be doing
something completely different. I dont know where I am going with this
just that I am lost within all of my thoughts. Do YOU believe in
fate?If so why? if not why?...I think its a good question to ask
someone. Its a crazy thing to think about if you ask me..I mean if your
life is planned out..Why worry? Yet still as a society we worry about
what we are doing..but if we believe in fate..Why worry? I dont get
it.. I worry, I worry all the time. I try not to but I cant help it. I
think this is why I have so much&nbsp; anxiety. I worry way tooo much.
As people would call me..A worry wart..Uggh I dont know what to do with
all the situations I am in..I feel like some of them arent supposed to
be there but if I believe in fate why should I even worry about it..Its
meant to be there...right? or can I change it..can I change fate..Is
that allowed?..<br>
<br>

Question to everyone..I dont care who you are..Do you believe in fate?

cute it had a pool and hot tub so that was good. The town was soo nice,

lights on them. Had some funny times with Lena Travis Bryan Jesse and
Mark..lol Get 'er dunnnnnnnnnn...GOTCHA! Oh man.. hmm well other than
that, on saturday there was 22 inches of snow. It was insane..I havent
seen that much snow since i was like 8. Ohb oy the flight to Salt Lake
on the way home was soo scary, the turbulence was soooo bad.The last
plane was the best though having staring contests..Travis's dance to
Crystal Baller! Drawing pictures of eachother and seeing Aj from
Backstreet boys...Atleast we think hahah...hmm well I am in pain so I

lovely..My brother came home for christmas which was the best gift
ever. Really didnt do much this break which was nice..I needed some
time to rest and just hang out with my brother..Had a bonding
expericence with him which i really needed. Hmmm hung out with Kaitlin
a lot too..Went to a John Mayer show in the city..It wasnt what I
expected..he played a lot of jazz and blues music..and one of his songs
but I still loved it because I got to stare at him, I never thought he
was good looking until I saw him up close hehe...Then comes New
Years..which was spent with my lovely friends and I was really happy
because my friend Krista joined us and it was really nice because I
rarely see her..We had our own Times Square Ball, which we do every
year and bang pots and pans and be the crazy spanish people that we
are.Im pretty excited because I leave for Wyoming in 3 days..You are
probably thinking well why is she going there...Skiing!!! Woooo..I just
might kill myself though because I am not the best skiier.hahah this
should be interesting!!!!!!=)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifes been going pretty good I guess. I realzied
that I need to get myself together and start doing good in school so I
can get into college..College..Boy is that a scary thought..Although I
still need to go through my senior year im still scared to go. I think
I might just want to move to Spain and never go to college and live on
a beach with my spanish cabana boy. That would be the life and just do
nothing..Oh wait i do that already..I jsut dont have a spanish cabana
boy..This is pretty much the longest entry ive done but I needed to get
somethings out.. I shall continue....I was watching Extreme Home
Makeovers and I thank God that he has blessed me with a home that is
livable and a family who loves me. I have learned not to take things
for granted and accept what I have..Yeah I might want the fancy clothes
and expensive things, lavish vacations but I just have to wait and
maybe I will get it. And with My friends..I am so blessed to have them
in my life( you know who you are)..I thank God each and every day for
giving me friends like you guys. I honestly dont know what I would do
without you..You guys have helped me through the toughest years in my
life and I dont think I would be the same without you guys..I think the
best way I could say this is..Thank you and I love you guys so
much.Alrite well enough blabbing Im got to set things up for tomorrow
and for WEDNESDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

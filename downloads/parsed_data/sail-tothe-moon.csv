"event","happy cinco de mayo...we had a fiesta today in spanish 3. lots of great mexican food. yum. school seemed extremely long today. 15 more days, can't wait. 

i guess i finally reconciled with lauren, who was mad at me and told me that i was ""changing."" i think i can see why she thinks i'm changing. i think all of us are changing as a matter of fact. i guess change is inevitable, it's bound to happen, so to speak. maybe that's why so many people hate it, including me. 

anyways, besides the slowness of today, it was rather a good day. it makes me happy to be around people that i can laugh with and have fun with.

now, i must go to work...and lg, i'll try to hold back from tanning. hehe. later ~sara marie"

"event","oh what a week. i started my first real job on wednesday. it was quite stressful and honestly i didn't know what the hell i was doing but hey who could blame me, it was my first day. it got better thursday when i actually knew what i was doing. so it's all good now. 

today was good. i was just happy it was friday. and one more day closer to summer. yey. i also feel terrible for missing erin's confirmation...aww she's going up so fast. lol. i wish i could have gone though, i had to be somewhere else during her confirmation so i was pissed but i'm sure she understands...lol she better! 

i got a call today from someone i wasn't expecting. it's strange how people just randomly call you one day when they haven't even talked to you in quite some time. i just wish that he'd never call or see me at all, cause feelings come back, and i don't at all want that. i don't ever want to go through what i went through with him. i swear that boy messes with my damn emotions sometimes...

*must be a different view, to be a me with a you...*

"event","i'm sitting here with a huge heavy blanket around me because i'm freezing. i'm over at erin's right now. her and her sister are fighting over the remote. it's funny watching them fight and scream at each other. 

earlier this morning we went to lhs and watched kelsey high jump for track. i think she got third place...woo go kels. 

anyways...last night was good. kels, erin and i went out and saw a movie. it was very good. it made me think about what i'm going to be like and where i'm going to be in 20 years. i wish i could have a crystal ball and see my future...that would be neat. 

after the movie we stopped by the tennis court and hung out with some friends while rocking out to some 80's music, haha...good times

k i'm gonna go watch final destination with erin. later ~sara"

"event","today was good. school was better than usual and i'm glad this week is almost over. i have been pretty busy this week, it's nice to finally have some time to lounge around and do nothing at all. 

i hung out with erin after school. we stopped by some stores for some quality shopping time...actually she was just looking for a sweater she needed to get. which she found successfully and i must say it's quite cute. 

anyways...it's funny how people from your past suddenly appear again. i talked to someone a few days ago that i haven't seen or spoken to in at least four years. i'm surprised he remembered me and knew exactly who i was. that happen to put a smile on my face. 

i'm longing for a vacation badly. even if it's only a few hours away. i just would like to be away from leavenworth for just a while. i'm sure once lauren g reads this she will probably yell at me and tell me that lv is the best place in the world, hehe of course she's right though, because...she knows everything! haha

night ~sara marie"

"event","so here it goes, my first entry and right now i'm sitting here contemplating on what i should write...i've never been one who had a journal, but sometimes new experiences are good right? so i'll try my best.

today went well. though nothing really exciting happened, but that's usually the case with the school i go to. i might be getting a job, which is always a plus i guess. a summer job would some good and i can always use some mucho dinero. 

anyways...summer is almost here and i'm so glad. i wish this school year would end already. right now it feels like time is going so slow and i just would like to speed it up a bit, at least until summer comes, then time can slow down as much as it wants. there's nothing better than having all the time in the world to do whatever you want...

night! ~sara"

"event","I finally have gotten to updating my web page.  I developed it completely in photoshop --nothing amazing, more or less eye candy.  I finally got tired of the minimalistic theme of my prior page.  

My life has been relatively smooth sailing for the past couple months.  My job prospects look dull, at least down here in Cleveland.  I am pretty excited about a company called Epic located out in Madison, I had my 2nd Interview/test with them last friday but it will be another week or so until i see if i continued on in the process.  

Epic is a software developer for hospital organizational software.  They have an extremely collegiate style of business, with no dress code and a very midwestern type of atmosphere.  I admit that i am a city person at heart but I am more than willing to be employed at a company that works with something that I believe has potential benefits for society (anything which makes healthcare work is by definition helpful to society).

If my employment prospects fall through, I am looking at Case's MSM program.  The MSM program allows me to take 1 yr of the MBA's core courses.  I would then leave and go to work for approximately one year then come back so I can start on my MBA for another year.  I will then concentrate my major in Organizational Development or Non profit management; Im not quite sure as of right now.   I have time to figure this all out, so im not too worried at the moment.

If I end up going back to Philly, I think i might look into social work.  After having a long discussion with my TA's from one of my classes they had mentioned to me that they both wished they went into clinical psychology.  In fact my one professor, Duncan, was more or less me in college.  He majored in both Econ and Psych and didnt use his psych degree.  Now he regrets it and wants to go back.  I am still trying to sort out everything in my life at the moment though.  Im scared that social work will burn me out, and that i will be a changed person.  This is all in my head though.  I have to really think about what my life will bring me and what i want to do with it.  

To sum this entry up, I have no job, I'm in a midlife crisis early, and its snowing outside.  Oh wait i didnt mention the snow.  Well now i have.  Just as i predicted... Cleveland rocks for 2 days with temperatures in the 70s and then when you get used to the nice temperature, Cleveland socks you with 3 inches of snow.  Thanks Cleveland... Thanks."

"event","I hate reading uneducated banter about how the US isn't helping out post-tsunami indian countries as much as we could. There are a couple of reasons which I'm opposed to such views:  Firstly, just because a country has a huge GDP doesn't mean that country should dish out Aide like it was candy.  If we were to give out such huge portions of money every time a disaster struck, the United States would most likely end up on a road to massive inflation and eventually collapse.  Beyond fiscal reasoning, how dare foreign countries (in the UN) bad mouth the United States.  Most of these countries recieve annual aide packages which could have better been put to use in the domestic sectors.  The United States donated 35 million dollars to the Indian countries struck by the Tsunami; which in fact was all the humanitarian money we could distribute without changing any constitutional amendments.  As of the writing of this blog, We are on the verge of passing an ammendment to distribute more money.  
To put things in perspective, what happened on September 11th?  The United states was hit in a terrorist attack.  The terrorists flew planes into symbols of the United State's Monetary and Physical power.  Luckily the monetary symbol was just that, a symbol; a plane hitting some of the towers in Chicago could have harmed the US a lot. None the less, we lost billions of dollars because investors were scared off, massive securities were being paid out to victims, loss of human capital, and general decline of the stock market.  What did the US get from the UN and other foreign countries? We got a care package with all the hugs and kissed the UN could ever offer.  Thanks WORLD!!!  YOUR FEELINGS REALLY MAKE US FEEL GREAT! Its ridiculous. If anyone could find me a table showing the amount of aide the United States offered other countries in the past 100 years I would be surprised if it surpassed 1 dollar.  

And to whomever feels the need to grammar check my posts, feel free to check the others, it makes me feel good someone is reading my posts.  But please keep in mind that if I felt the need to writing clearly and effectively, I wouldnt be writing on livejournal.com now would I?  Ill keep you posted on my newest blog which is still under construction at blog.case.edu.  

Basically this rant is for those who seem to hate the US (move to canada).  

On to happier news.  Today i went snowboarding...again --its an addiction.  good times.  Killington Jill came for round 2, and beck joined --both on their first (and for jill--last) snowboarding exhibitions. Some of their falls were priceless...which makes me kick myself in the ass for not having a camera, but believe me faceplants in the snow WERE perfected this day.

"event","I went snowboarding in killington, and after a thousand hour drive back everyone was safe and sound in their homes for christmas.  To sum of the trip -it was great (pointless pictures to come)

2 days of me sucking it up on the slopes
2 nights of drunken good times and hot tub debauchery
1 night of whining about how sick i am and falling asleep at 11pm
1 day of me getting my snow-feet back then having to leave --of course

----

Now i am scheduling a new outing.  BLUE MOUNTAIN ON THURSDAY! be there or be square.  As of now Jill is going and Im making Joanna and her sister go.  I love snowboarding even if i cant position my weight properly (possibly the reason why im going to take my first lesson...ever)

Pete and Jill have about a billion pictures (caroline as well)  so i cant wait to get my hands on them --mainly because the pictures from the first nights drunken grind party were purely amazing.

----

In other news, Christmas was wonderful.  Its nice to see family every now and then --its just the extended family that really drains me.  For some reason the extended family always seems to find a flaw and exploit it.  For example on my moms side, my harmatia was a story about me getting sick from drinking when i was 15 because i hid a little vodka in a can of soda --of course i regret it; kinda.  And on my fathers side, my harmatia is my current girlfriend.  They just love finding anything to harass me about; whether it be my pink shirt, or my ""neck discoloration.""

But either way, i had a nice holiday.. now i just have to finish up my final semester at Case Western and then i can go obtain that nonprofit job (and make no money --but hopefully be happy) so i can go into organizational behavior/development."

Dates: 12/19 - 12/22
Trails: 100 (predicted to be open --currently 60 are open)

Im so very excited... 1 week from today i will be sitting in a hot tub soaking after a day of snowboarding!

This might end up being the number 2 best time this year!  Number one obviously being my trip to cancun.  Though i was unsure about going at first, due to my prior experience in Daytona, i decided why not... this will be the only time i will ever be able to go on a trip like this; so i put down my 1300.. and thats where im going.  Even better is how my father actually fully supports my decision --possibly because he knows that once i get a job, i probably wont have the time to dedicate torwards vacations such as cancun.  

Beyond all trips, School is winding up.. tomorrow is my last final; public finance none the less.  I guess this about winds up the whole point of this live journal.  But im sure i can update all my AVID readers about my life every now and then.

This winter vacation (all 2 weeks of it) i need to get on top of my applications and start making cover letters (one aspect all my applications lack).

So in short, if you know any place which would a) train me in consulting b) train me in management c) train me in organizational behavior d) pay me or e)hire me -- send them my way!"

As the Semester is more or less over and i am getting bogged down by class projects, papers, midterms, job applications, and real life -- i have folded under the pressure and attempted using the LSI to help me chart how i will handle the coming weeks.

Joel and I had some quality time to discuss many issues ranging from politics to work to class...i mean, what else would we discuss on an 8 hour drive from philly to cleveland.  Talking about jobs got me thinking about what kind of work is best to get experience in before entering into the field of organizational behavior.  After a long debate we ended up agreeing that Consultant work was very important in the field of organizational behavior due to the out of the box thinking that sometimes needs to occur to fix a problem.  What i am now left wondering is... what type of experience will best prepare me for both schooling in OB or a job in OB?"

About 2/3rds of the way through I started to understand the basis for this paper. It wasnt really about who i am, what i do, what i want to become...its about goal setting and setting the proper goals dependant upon what type of person you are.

"event","With 2/3 of the projects completed, i can finally breathe a long sigh of relief...my project is over.  The project had more barriers then i am used to... In prior other classes, group projects consisted of one team made up of 2 overachievers and 2 underachievers.  The Project generally entailed lots of research using internet databases, libraries, and journals to gather the information which would be presented by one of the overachievers as the other 3 members stood motionless by the presenter. This project took the major turn of needing to do actual field studies in order to gather information which was impossible to find through any other research method.  It was relatively refreshing to attempt this method, but frightening at the same time.  I am a internet worm...usually able to weed out any information required for a project...this project didnt allow me to nearly attempt this.  

In fact This project brought to light my major weakness--group presentations.  Though i love spouting off information to anyone willing to listen, something about presenting to a group of peers scares me.  I was not always like this though; in my middle school and highschool years we had to take part in poetry contests where we would memorize a piece of prose or poetry and spout it off in a convincing manner-- We were judged on stance, diction, clarity, etc.   I generally got into the finals never flinching under pressure.  When i got into college this all changed.  For some reason its unnerving when im around my peers because im constantly worried what they are thinking (as thier opinion matters more to me).  I guess Prof. P could attest to my bumbled segment --I guess its always different when you are standing in front of a mirror as opposed to standing in front of a group of 50 people (half of which are suckin down beers).

Everyone else's project were generally interesting.  Some more than others (our being the least in my opinion; our subject matter was a little dry).  It was interesting to see different methods used by groups such as duel speakers vs groups, movies vs information, Quality vs Quantity.   Generally i felt the over-all quality of the presentations was B+.  Im interested to see the last days presentations, and more importantly the evaluations."

I am glad i was finally able to enter into a digital photography class because i always felt that i had more freedom to express what i wanted my photos to convey.  My project in particular was attempting to show emotions [loneliness, anger, a broken heart, and remorse].  Some emotions are a little more conceptual then others (for example remorse --i was trying to show the pain of remorse while giving sense that you are still looking back on what you have done).  Its almost funny how my photography is so dark, and the ideas behind each photo are so macabre, yet id like to think of myself as a happy go lucky jovial type guy!  Eh, c'est la vie.

"event","# Who could you ask for feedback or advice about your plans for the future?

I think the best people to ask advice about your future are acquaintances.  Friends will give you sugar coated feedback no matter how hard they try to be absolutely truthful.  Its hard being a friend and being critical of those you care about.  The only time i found myself being truly critical of a friend was when i found him so far off track that i started to remove myself from the friendship --he ended up moving far away and not being heard from again.  With acquaintances, you dont necessarily dislike the person, but you are more willing to be frank with them about their idea.  Now obviously these acquaintances are not people you just met once before... these are people who you could consider yourself a ""friend"" with but you see them only by chance as a random encounter.  These people may know you relatively well (through classes etc) and be more willing to help you out when giving advice.

# How can you open yourself up to hear what they have to say?

In order to actually take advice seriously you have to be willing to accept the advice.  In order to accept advice you have to understand that:
1) these people know more than you in a certain field
2) these people are trust worthy and generally care about your advancement 
3) these people are familiar with your background and know what you are capable of

# How can you get past your fear that they might think your plans are not ""perfect"" and consider how your plans might become even more true to your personal values, more achievable, more practical, more robust?

In order to get past the fear of not being perfect you have to simply accept that fact that no one can take into account all scenarios that a possible plan might bring up.  You may think, ""oh man, my new proposal is going to generate a billion barrels of oil, and the oil problem is OVER!""  but just as quickly people might tell you ""hey, you do realize that tapping into the oil reserves in alaska threatens the environment...and even if the impact is minimal, what will we do when we dry up the well... this is not an emergency and therefore we should keep it as backup.""  --hopefully you will realize that this is a legitimate argument and instead of building the plant and pumping immediately, you create the plans, gather the required resources, and hold off until an oil problem arises. This way you did not remove your idea completely, but rather assimilated their ideas into your own, and created a better plan all together."

"event","As this class is quickly drawing to a close, i have started to think more and more about how i intend to manage a team when i (hopefully) enter the job market.  Its easy to say, oh well ill just analyze the team atmosphere and make sure the team has sufficient arguments and trust (ala 5 dysfunctions of team) and then make sure the political and structural segments of the firm are working properly with good employee satisfaction; but will i ACTUALLY do that.  The answer is most likely no.  Everyone who is leaving this class will head out on their own to make their own decisions on what frame, or what dysfunctions, or even what finances should be concentrated upon while they make up/analyze their teams.  I think i am most comfortable with the human resources frame and my duopoly of dysfunction theory (trust/conflict).  This class has made me aware of other frameworks which i generally bunched into the whole problematic system of a nonfunctional business atmosphere.  Now that everything is tagged and ordered everything has become a little more clear in my eyes.  

The main question i think i am getting at i guess is, as an organizational behaviorist, is it feasible or rather acceptable to concentrate on one aspect of a business or will that just lead to a quick deterioration of the system.  The way i imagine a future job as an organizational behaviorist is a team of 3 members who specialize in the three separate frames and fix problems only in that frame.  

Throughout my 4 years at case studying psychology and economics i have grown accustomed to hearing that while one thing may not work all the time, and another thing might not work all the time, if you combine them, then they will work 90% of the time.  I have a feeling that any one person will find one area of organizational behavior most important...but if you combined people, you would eventually create a functional system.

Does anyone else feel the same way, or am i just wrong?"

I wondered if i was really ready for the real world.  I pondered whats the point of work if it isnt enjoyable.  Just then i reached enlightenment.  There is no reason to PLAN your life because there are way too many variables.  Sure you can set goals...but life goals are just a little too much fo a stretch for me at the moment.  I personally enjoy finding myself in the right place at the right time.

Thinking about the next 10 years of my life makes my head spin, hell... thinking about next year even blows my mind.  I have no exact plan at the moment.  I have this generalized ideal scenario if you want to call it that.  It starts with me entering into some entry level job where i am in charge of a team or otherwise gives me some managment level skills.  Following a 2 year tenor at this job, i plan on entering into graduate school for Organizational Behavior and getting a masters.  After that... the wind will wisk me away to some magical job where i do nothing yet am paid handsomely.  --thats my plan

What i expect to happen is quite simple.  I will get a really crappy job at a retail store, quit and move to vermont for the winter where i will work at a lodge on the mountains --hopefully they will provide me with living arrangements and i will snowboard all season long.  At the end of the season i will realize my life is in shambles and will approach a decent company with absolutely no skills to provide them with.  After a disheartening interview i will find contact a successful friend will will find me a job in his company, and this is where i will remain for the next 5 years. Thats my prediction. 

So the way i balance planning and fate...is simple.  I either hold a fantasy dream scenario...or a dooms-day scenario which borders on realistic.  Sigh"

Quoting South Park ""You can either vote for a turd sandwich or a giant douche, but no matter who wins, you are either being represented by a giant douche or a turd sandwich.""

I will be honest that im glad bush won as i prefer the giant douche to the turd sandwich.  I believe his economic policy is what has allowed our country to emerge from recession so quickly.  Every uneducated person seems to think his policy put us in recession, but there were many external factors which caused us to plumet into recession --mainly the dotcom and the attacks (or the litigation introduced after the attacks).  Sadistically, Im glad there is a no child left behind act, because schools who cant cut it fail.  When these crappy schools fail, students are forced to go to better schools or into private schools --natural selection of education.  This directly relates back to the act i voted on asking to tax ohio more to fund their failing school system.. i of course voted against the tax raise.  My old neighborhood school district in philadelphia was possibly the worst school system on the entire planet, but that school charge exorbitant taxes to fund their shitty school.  It was the blackhole of my county.  The money that was put in there-- disappeared, never to be seen again.  I assume cleveland is just the same.

As for foreign policy.. As long as we are on good terms with china and they are financing our bonds and sustaining us while our debt grows.. im happy.  The EU is basically a waste of our time, as is the UN... so whatever.  But yes, i realize foreign relations are very important... but as long as we are at war, their attitudes are not going to change.

And finally, for all of those whining that the gay marrage ban is terrible, what does it actually accomplish?  Nothing.  So what some gay people who are whining that they cant say they are married ON LEGAL DOCUMENTS.  Give me a break.  Religions obviously dont want the term used.. so whatever...life goes on.  I am in total support of gay partnerships so they get the same tax breaks etc as straight couples. but honestly they are whining because they cant check married on a legal document.. so retarded.  People should be putting their effort into a partnership bill rather than whining that they cant write married on a doctors bill.  

I will leave everybody with this:

"event","thursdays class raised some very good points about how you should go about gaining peoples trust without losing respect/power.  The main point that was brought up was the cost/benefits of using soft vs hard speech to acquire an accepting environment in the workplace.  The problem is no one way is better then the other.  If you talk to fluffy you lose respect --if you talk to hard, no one will ever own up to a fault.  Even if you combine the two you will get nowhere in the long run.  Sure originally people will own up to their mistakes.  But once they see that in the end someone was cut, then they will feel slighted that you tried to make them feel comfortable but just when they least expected it, you came down with the axe.  I think the only way to solve this problem is through a democratic system.  All people involved have to make a group decision on what action should be taken. The most important thing is for accidents to be learned from, not feared.   fearing a problem will only make it worse --small problems need to be dealt with internally through workshops and discussions.  Big problems needs to go through external sources (such as the law). The main thing which needs to be done is reigning in trial lawyers who just chase after the health care system.  If a problem occured but was rectified with no ill outcomes..then its no ones business to intevene except for the companies.  If there was a major problem with the care due to negligence.. then maybe its time for the court to step in."

"event","Question of the millennium:

What role does honesty play in the business world? What role should it play?

I would hope that by now my students know where I stand on that last question, but just in case I have not been clear: I stand for radical honesty. Do you? Why or why not?

-----------

This question gets down to the core of our very existence.  The question should have been phrased as, ""What role does honesty play in everything we do?""  The day you entered college you pretty much signed your life away to the honesty code.  What is this mysterious guiding code?  Actually, Its a simple statement --basically it says, you wont lie, steal, cheat, defame, or reduce the quality of education while in tenor at college.  The honor code basically becomes that little angel sitting on your shoulder saying, ""dont do that, you promised you wouldnt!""   

The question is...does it work.  It gets down to your motives and morals in life.  If im motivated to get an 'A' no matter what not caring how i got it...then sure... cheat away..lie, steal, carelessly disregard your fellow students.  Unfortunately, for these types of students, they are digging themselves into a bottomless pit.  Cheating helps now sure... but does it teach you the material? -- let me answer that one...NO! So basically following the honor code is for your own good.

Now, lets fast forward to the question at hand.. does honor (or the honor code) have a place in the business world.  The answer --well it depends on the situation.  

Scenario 1:  
Joe is in charge of a project in which he will restructure the entire healthcare system at the VA.  While on a meeting with an HMO provider, the provider offers him a bribe to only allow low risk patients into the hospitals so that prices will be low.  An externality of this will be that the hospital will look like a top rate hospital.  Joe takes the bribe and lobbies the hospital to change its policy towards critical care patients.  


--Was his choice to accept the bribe correct?  The answer is no.  Joe was payed off to help keep costs down for the HMO..he then followed through and lied to his colleagues so that the plan of action would go through.  He had no regard for those who would be hurt by such a situation.


Scenario 2:
Joe works as a hospice care provider as the VA.  while on duty he notices a patient in excruciating pain do to end stage cancer.  He also notices that the patients caregivers have requested that no drugs are to be administered under any circumstance.  Joe then secretly administers the patient pain killers. The next day he is confronted about missing pain killers.  Joe lies and says that he had accidentally spilled the container the previous day and must not have picked up all the pills.

--this perhaps may not be the best example, as he is going against the will of the caregiver, but the idea is there.  Joe was following his morals to help the patient cope...then told a white lie to cover his tracks.  This type of dishonesty is much more valid then the prior example.

So to answer the question.  Honesty in the business setting must be associated with ones morals.  If one is doing something in which they feel is best, then that is the most honest plan of action that person can take.  If a person acts against what he knows is best, then he is acting purely dishonestly.

In the business place honesty should follow both the morals and values a person hold, and follow the general mission statement set out by their company.  If there is a disconnect between the two, then it would be best that employee left the business and went elsewhwere.

In short.  Sometimes its best to be completely honest with yourself, but then again sometimes being honest may get you in trouble.. so its up to you whether you place your values or your works values first."

"event","Well today winds down the Race at case with a Nobel Laureate coming to talk about the economy.  This is a once in a college-time event and shouldnt be missed --even if he is pro kerry.  Go see him talk at 5pm today at Severence --be there or be square.

Other than that, yesterdays pre-debate happenings were wild.  Everything from dodgeball to circus music to cnn to mtv to 2 naked dudes making a point about the 2 party system.  The predebate happenings were more than fulfilling.

And finally the debate.  I was honestly surprised with Cheney; i came into the debate thinking edwards was going to smooth talk his way into the publics heart while cheney would remain soft spoken and reserved.  I was surprised to see the level of intensity that Cheney cooly pressed onto edwards.  Edwards was able to quip back towards Cheneys Halburton job...but honestly that is an inarguable position... and Cheney again cooly slid the remarks to the side.  It seemed if by the middle...edwards was getting quite flustered by Cheneys remarks about his record but rather then ignoring the comments like Cheney did, Edwards attempted to qualify his records and deface cheney...this was not a good method in my opinion.  It shows both arrogance and weakness.  Both canidates proved to have hard hitting questions.  And though i concede that Edwards had the first round... it was only because it was all on foreign policy.  This is the hardest problem for the bush administration as they have done some bad things in 20/20 hindsight...but at the time they were right.. and if you can remember far back enough, there was a high approval rating for war in the beginning.  So dont say its bushes fault when you initially agreed with it.  You break it you buy it.  Once the debate got into Domestic and economics policy, i definitely believe Cheney had the one up...and honestly i believe economic/domestic policy is the most important policy to the american people.  Sure the world may not like us... but id rather be hated abroad but happy at home then hated at home, but have empathy felt for my pain abroad.

On to Class events.  The writing process for the paper has come to a crawl in the past week.  With the debates happening i have had no time to work on the paper and the deadline is soon approaching. In the one section i have completed, i have actually noticed a pattern in how i describe myself.  I tend to use the human resources frame to discuss my qualities.  My qualities seem to cater towards the people in the workplace rather then the political frame which caters to the good of the company.  I feel that this mindset places me at a certain level at a company which will lead to a deadend unless im able to change my ideals to benefit the political mindset.  In a sense i have already done this with my political disposition.  I look at the cost benefits rather than the caring compassionate side for the losers.  But extending this mindset into the career arena is a long jump from where i am now.  The question i pose is how exactly can you create a hybrid between two mindsets without destroying one or the other?"

I plan on talking to Leo Garrison --a hospital administrator, and Kennith Kovatch an OD specialist who works with all types of organizational issues.  Both were contacted through connections which i have grown since my time at case.  Im actually really excited about Mr Kovatchs interview just because his field of work follows closely, not only with this class, but also with my future goals.  Mr. Garrison is also working in a field of great interest to me --the healthcare field.  Im not exactly sure where my life will take me, but the way i see it is that i will be either in a healthcare/nonprofit/or straight organizational development type of industry.  So hitting all 3 is great (as healthcare is generally nonprofit).  Im hoping i will learn a couple interesting facts about these fields and use them to better direct my goals.  Well short post, but i was inspired...so i wrote.  Enjoy."

"event","What story do you want to tell about yourself in your next job interview, that can demonstrate transferable skills from a hobby or interest that are relevant for the workforce?

This is an interesting topic as this post just follows mock interview day at Case.  Maybe it was just my luck, but the interviewer which i had on Friday decided to discuss my life focusing more on my earlier experiences than what i thought was more important (my internships and co-ops).  

The first question my interviewer asked was:  Tell me about you.  Start from the beginning...gradeschool, and work your way up.  I was shocked when first asked this as i would never have expected an interviewer to care about my gradeschool/highschool experiences.  But i conceded.  

I explained how i went to a boys and girls catholic school in Lansdowne PA (a suburb of Philadelphia) and entered into Devon Preparatory school in the 6th grade.  As i was explaining my activities in highschool i stumbled onto my community services projects which i did through most of my highschool years -- a piece of my history which had all but been forgotten (the community service part at least).  He became very interested in my time as a computer technician at a volunteer project named the Childrens Project 2000 and my time as a nurses aide in a nursing home.  It turns out one of his main goals in hiring executives (he was an executive recruiter) was finding people who worked in a vast diversity of fields while still making time for others in community services.  

We continued on about Community Service and my lesser jobs at Buckle (a clothing store) and Williams and Sanoma (a kitchen appliance store) for the majority of my time.  He was captivated that i had hobbies beyond school work, actually represented my lesser jobs on my application (however footnoted they may have been) and allowed time for community service projects throughout my schooling.

I am sure that if i had a different interviewer i may have had a more professional business related discussion about my CO-OP at PJM or my internship with American Express, but this interviewer felt that diverse experiences were more important then any one job.

So in my interview i may attempt to sell my prior experiences more than any work or school related study.

I think the thing that really pulled the interview together was his parting words of ""Alex I think you are a very articulate, well versed individual and any perceived failure was made up in turn by your great social presence.  The only weakness i found in our interview was that you dont quite know where you want to go in the coming months, but honestly that is the best weakness to have and i encourage you to search the field for somethign that suits you best.  I am glad you are a smart individual but not a nerd and are able to carry yourself better than 90% of the people i interviewed today...""

What a self esteem boost!  Articulate though --i don't know about that."

"event","Todays events revolved around selling your leadership abilities.  This is all good and great, but im not sure if people were being genuine about their views.  I felt like everyone was selling themselves, trying to earn the coveted team-leader position.  Its situations like these that really test me --or more really make me think.  Sure I could join the crew act like General Paton and rally the troops to victory, but then again...is that me?  Before taking up psychology I always attributed my easing back during times which people attempted to show off as a method of acting ""cool""  or just playing it straight (possibly the honesty factor).  But in the last couple years i realized how much i like to analyze people and pick apart exactly why they are doing the things they are doing; are they just selling themselves or are they truly and honestly taking up the reins and fighting the good war. But thats just a little self-reflection i guess.

Now onto the discussions-- What are the 5 dysfunctions of a team and why I think its not quite on target.  Starting from the bottom, as Patrick Lencioni contends, Lack of Trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results; these make up the Dysfunction pyramid.  Sure thats great... but honestly i see many of those dysfunctions as integrally related into absence of trust or lack of commitment.  If i were to come up with a scheme of dysfunction in group i would head it by lack of guidance.  Guidance is very important in any group.  People will always be lazy, its a fact of life.  Someone needs to take control or else the team WILL fail.  Someone needs to organize and map out what the teams goals are and where they are currently headed.   This is all guidance.  Next i contend Trust and Commitment together form the next level of team dysfunction.  If a team trust each other they are willing to question their views and take accountability for their misgivings. If a team is committed to each other they will be willing to accept the criticizing and togthet accept responsibilities for failure.   Finally I contend that the teams final dysfunction is balance. This Balance envelopes the other dysfunctions as they all require balance. For example, You cant be friends with people or else its harder to fire them if they fail, or you cant just criticize people too much or else you will go no where.  This is just my outlook on the main dysfunctions of a team  but i must agree that Lencioni did hit on important points but i believe those point would be simplified into a simple 2 square graph enveloped by balance.  

IN other news, I tried to be an informed voter and went to the case democrats forum tonight, but it was 88% bush bashing and 10% icing --ie sounds good out loud but impossible to implement.  The remaining 2% was informative but was unable to sway my vote; but hopefully i will be taking pictures at the Vice Presidential debate (thats definitely not in stone yet) and would give me a nice forum to poll views.  

Thats all."

"event","On wednesday I met with Professor Piderit about the team-leader position.  Unfortunately I entered the meeting thinking it was an information session rather than a Q and A.  I immediately felt the pressure of interviewing for a position in a company with vague questions such as ""Why do you think you would be a good leader"" and ""what do you think your main flaw will be in the leadership program, and how will you address it.""  --Ok those might not be exact quotes...  But none-the-less, it put me on the spot to think about what i do best and worst.  This is possibly my largest flaw as i can never really address my strengths and weaknesses.  I rely on others views to tell me what I need to change.  So coming up with an answer for why im a good leader makes me want to quote all the great qualities which i understand leaders to have.  But i fought the urge and came up with the one thing which i feel is my greatest strength, my ability to socialize.  I am verbose and friendly and easily make friends; in fact the most recent survey we took listing things we hold as most important i listed many qualites such as friendship, loyalty, and honesty.  These possibly mean the most to me as a person --though maybe is a bad idea for a leader.  Of course i was called out on this, and she brought back the whole idea of respect and friendship.  Do you want to be respected by your team or well liked (but not taken seriously).  Its a hard position for me as i find myself in the later.  

The rest of our meeting was spent discussing my hatred of cleveland.  Something of which i will quote my one friend on when she first heard i got accepted to case and was going to cleveland. 

""Cleveland is just ....gloomy.  Like its just...gloomy.  I mean there is nothing to do there, its just so gloomy!""  

-- oh how she was right.  the sky is the same shade of grey for 8 months of the year."

"event","PROFESSORS THOUGHTS:

""THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS THE ALLY OF UNION-BUSTERS AND THE ENEMY OF WORKING AMERICANS

...It would be bad enough if the Bush administration were merely trying to turn the clock back to the ""good old days"" of untrammeled managerial prerogatives and unfettered markets. In reality, however, this administration is forging an ever more noxious mix of private economic interests and covert public power. Our economic, social, health, and environmental security is threatened as never before.""

MY THOUGHTS:

Ever since I was a child, I was raised to understand that I need to take responsibility for my actions.  This is deeply ingrained in who I have become.  This is the main reason I plan on voting for George W Bush.  Bush has undertaken the unpopular opinion that people need to take control of their lives.  How can you call him an enemy of the working america when he is planing on cutting welfare to force people to support themselves through working.  It is completely backwards to assume that increasing welfare will help working america.  People on welfare have gotten too cozy getting their paychecks from the government; would you want to work if you could make more money from the US government then working at McDonalds?  The answer to that is no, but G.W. is going to force them into that situation.  A while back, Bush touted that the unemployment rate was falling and more people were working; Kerry fired back saying only low end jobs were being filled and that the highly skilled jobs werent.  Kerry's views are backwards though.  Skilled jobs take time to take effect.  For example take the health care market; say there may be a major drought in doctors.  It will take a good 8 years before the market can satisfy the need.  The market will need to raise the dr.s salaries to draw more potential doctors, they will then need to wait until they are educated and trained.  Only then will the gap be filled.  Like just like it took time for doctors to train, it takes time for low wage workers to fill up management positions and learn exactly what to do.  So in this point Kerry is wrong and by the same coin i would contend you are too.  <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/09/06/work.poll.ap/index.html"">Read this to see how america feels about its working conditions</a>

As for Unions-busters -- i really have no comment on this subject.  Unions are good in the short term to get the benefits they may deserve.  But in the long term, i feel unions are one of the largest problems in the workplace.  Unions, if they get too large, will begin to throw their power around too much.  This happened in Philadelphia when the new stadiums were being built.  Unions required the city to employ them as the contractors and electricians.  This caused the price of the stadium to skyrocket as union fees skyrocketed. In the end it ended up costing the city much much more than if they had contracted a separate entity to build the stadium.

So in conclusion i would actually say that Bush's plans will not hurt us as much as naysayers would like us to say, but actually they will support a nation which is increasingly relying on big government instead of individual responsibility."

"event","One question I have been asked one too many times in my short life-time is ""what is your learning style?""  In grade-school it was auditory, in high-school, it was visual-tactile, and now in college, its been labeled as assimilating (though closer to a centralist learning style then anything.  What does this really mean though? For me its just a label placed on something I have known all along, I learn best using every method; with a peculiar focus on logic --which reflects the assimilating learning style.

Again, what does this really mean?  Well...  Nothing.  It's a label.  Time spent putting a name to something which we intuitively knew already.  Now i can just read how other people view my learning style.  Thats great, but honestly this probably will not help me develop as a person in a managing position --though now I have the amazing ability to label you and tell you why I don't mesh well with your learning style.

I feel that the only true way to actually enhance relationships in the workplace is to offer a variety of options to people.  They will chose the path that suits how they work best.    Obviously I have more to learn about the topic at hand, but at the moment I feel like its just another survey which doesn't prove anything but groups the taker into a word."

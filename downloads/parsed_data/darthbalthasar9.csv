"event","1.last year i had this teacher named mrs.roseman and her room was very cold. she walks realy slow. she has taught at homewood high school for a very long time i think and she was retiring that year. so one day in biology a thought came across my mind. what if mrs roseman was actually a ghost and she kept the classroom really cold so no one would be able to tell that she was a ghost. she walked really slow so no one would be able to tell that she was actually gliding. and she actually died in the early 90s and her spirt was trapped in the school. and her freshmen class set her spirit free.

so the wedding was in selma. we had to stop by my sisters boyfriends mom house. we got ready there then we left for the wedding we got  there at 3 which was one hour before the wedding was supposed to start. so we go inside and sit down on the brides side because thats was where we were supposed to sit alright so the weddin didnt start till and hour and a half later. so i was getting aggitated cuz  i was ready to go. ok well there was this guy who was singin this lady divine song right and all the groomsmen came out so i was wtf i dont see any women so y is he singing the song i mean y not wait till the bride comes out to sing the song. then the brides maid come out one at a time then a groomsmen went to meet up with her bow then start walkin then stop take a picture then walk up to the front stop twirl the bridesmaid then position her then walk back to his position this happened like 11 more times then the did it with the jr bridesmaid, then a jr bride came out. then the flower girls. then the wedding actually started. right so we stood up when the bride came because i guess that is what u would normally have to do. but then we had to sit down because on the program it said that we were to remain seated but none of the people on the brides side had a program. ok so it was over quickly afterwards,. so we went to the reception later and the food was dissappointing one of the jr groomsmen stepped on my foot. and there was a bunch of ghetto people there. there was this one women who showed up with this shirt and her breasts were like practically hanging out and they were tattooed i am sorry i just couldnt help staring but thats it oh yeah the guy who songed sucked."

"event","so today was okay.i went to the zoo for the first time in my whole life. it was actually pretty fun well at least more fun then i thought it was gonna be. i saw all sorts of animals. most of them was really annoying like the birds. but it was still fun though. i saw a gorilla for the first time in real life. it was cool. i saw the cutest little monkeys at least i think they were monkeys i dont really know actually. well let me start from the beginning of the day. so i woke up at 9:30 only cuz my nephew woke me by playing with my eyes for some reason. i swear that  kid is crazy. then we (me, my sister=destiny, and nephew=khalil) went to walmart to buy some film for our camera. we did then we went to get our other sister camisha. then we went to wendys and ate something. next we went to the zoo. the first thing we saw was these birds i forgot what they were called. all i know is that they were multicolored. then we went to the primates. we saw all kinds of monkeys like the black hand spider monkey, orangutan, baboon,(damn that thing is ugly) and the gorilla. we also saw a cotton top tamarin and pygmy. then we went to where the elephant was. there we saw an elephant, rhino, hippo, and a manned wolf(aint even a wolf it is like a fox with stilts). we saw some cheetahs. we went to the savannah next and saw giraffeas(sorry cant spell that for some reason), gazzell(which is a mini antelope), ostrich,meercat, palla cat, fennec,white bengal tiger,red panda bear,indochinese tiger(which may i add was being a real bitch because everytime that it saw me it would turn around and leave and hide), a lion and a lemur. i went to birds side and i saw a lot of really annoying birds. i saw an macaw. i almost got ate up by a swan i dont know why it wanted to eat me i guess it thought i might taste good or something.i saw a flamingo it was cool. i went to the reptiles side and saw some pretty cool things as well. the cool things that i saw was the komodo dragon, bearded dragon, and the egyptian cobra. i saw some other snkes too but they were not as cool at least that is what i think like an anaconda, a python , king cobra, and a rattlesnake. we saw some aligators. we went to the petting zoo area and i saw a llama, sheep, goat, and chicken. then we left and i was really tired because my feet was sore. then we took khalil home a day earlier because his mom called. we took him and i went to chickfila and got some nuggets and ate them. i went home and watched some televison and thats it. oh yeah we took lots and lots of pictures while we were at the zoo.i even took some for my cell phone. so overall i had a lot of fun today.and maybe one day i might even go to the zoo more often."

"event","yesterday was a good day. it did not start out being a good day because my nephew started to get on my nerves. so later on in the evening time of that day i talked to my best friend kacee who i hadnt have talked to in like forever well more like last tuesday. so she pretty much made my day yesterday because we can just talk about stuff, pretty much anything. plus she is actually funny. she is a really cool person. she always finds the most interesting things on the internet. like a couple of days ago she dopted a fetus. i was like haha cool. she is in to photography and art. i think thats awesome. she shows me some odd pictures to that i dont know why but i find them funny just because of the way they look. she is just cool in my opinion mostly because everytime we have a conversation it doesnt die because we always have something to talk about. all and all she is one of my favorite friends."

"event","i decided that i am gonna learn to draw. i am going to do this because i have so much creativity but no way to put it into use. plus there is something that i cant describe in words so they can mentally see it. so ii must learn to draw so i will be able to show it to them. and it will be great just wait and see i might even put in this lj one day when i do draw. which might take me a long time to do sense i am just now really learning to draw and i dont expect me to bee super great at it. it is just that i hope i will have the patience (which is something that i just do not have or i might have a little of it)to stick with it. i am sure that i will because i am really tired of not having a way to express myself in something that i actually want to do. so i will learn and when i do i will be great because i am me and whatever i want to do i do it great at least that is how i see it. so anyone that already knows how to draw please tell me how long did it take u before u became good and finally what do u like to draw."

"event","it was an okay day i guess. i am still babysitting and they are not being like really bad they were not even argueing as much as much as they did the day before which was really good because they were starting to give me a really bad headache. so we went to the swimming pool and i found out something very intereesting about my nephew. before we went to the pool he was talking about how he was sooooooooooooo good at swimming. he got in that pool and was about to cry.it was pretty funny we played around in the pool and i tried to teach him how to swim. he was doing really good but  he had got jealous of this two year old who was swimming in the deep end so we took him out of the pool and made him sit down. we left eventually by then i was really tired and kinda hungry.i had a headache so i ate a turkey sandwich then took a tylenol. i slept for three hours straight. it was great. i woke up at eight and i went to golden corral whle my niece went to this hair show with my other sister. i ate went home and then went to sleep. my nephew was sleeping in the same room as me and he snores really really loud. when he snores it sounds like that ghost thing in the movie called the grudge u know that really irritating sound.so i could not sleep at all then i felt like i was on fire it was horrible so i pretty much just sat there. i eventually fell  asleep then woke up at six."

TODAY I REALIZED THAT CHEF BOYARDEE SMELLS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE DOG FOOD. NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING TO YOURSELF ""DOES THIS KID EAT DOG FOOD."" WELL I DO NOT I AM JUST SAYING THAT THEY SMELL SIMILAR. I WILL NOT GO AS FAR AS TO EAT DOG FOOD TO PROVE MY THEORY, BUT THOSE OF YOU WHO DO HAVE DOGS SHOULD TRY AND GIVE YOUR DOG SOME CHEF BOYARDEE. NOW DOING THIS REALLY WILL NOT PROVE ANYTHING AT ALL BECAUSE A DOG WILL PRETTY MUCH EAT ANYTHING, BUT IF YOUR DOG DOES NOT EAT  THE CHEF BOYARDEE I HIGHLY ADVISE YOU TO REFRAIN FROM EATING CHEF BOYARDEE. NOW REMEMBER THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE MY OPINION TO HEART. PLUS I HAVE NO FACTS AT ALL TO SUPPORT MY ACCUSATION. I AM JUST SAYING DO YOU NOT FIND IT WEIRD THAT THEY SMELL SO SIMILAR. I COULD DO SOME RESEARCH TO SUPPORT MY CLAIM BUT I AM NOT IN AN RESEARCHING MOOD RIGHT NOW. SO I WILL NOT RESEARCH IT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I DO NOT GO AROUND AND SNIFF STUFF FOR FUN OR NOTHING OK. IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT SPARKED MY CURIOSITY. SO ALRIGHT NOW WHAT I NEED FROM SOMEBODY WHO READS THIS IS TO TELL ME WHAT PS MEANS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW IN WRITING LETTERS AND STUFF PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET FINISH WITH THEIR MAIN TOPIC THAT THEY ARE WRITING ABOUT AND AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THEIR PAPER THEY WRITE P.S. AND SOME REALLY RANDOM SHIT ABOUT THEY WANT TO KNOW OR SOMETHING. I DO NOT KNOW. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS SO IT WILL BE GREAT IF SOMEONE WOULD TELL ME."

"event","today after i finshed talking to kacee and watching vh1. so i was really really bored right. right. so i didnt have nothing to do so i got bored when all of a sudden a thought came acrossed my mind. that thought was i should make a powerpoint. a powerpoint about what u may ask. a powerpoint about dreams. now u might be thinking well why in hell would someone just randomly decide to make a powerpoint about dreams. well u know what i am gonna tell u i did the powerpoint on dreams because before school got out in my english class we had to write an expository essay on any topic of our chosing. i chose to write about dreams. i did and i got a good grade on the essay at least i think so anyway. but enough about that i crreated a powerpoint right. in working on the creation of this powerpoint i look onto the research i gathered when i wrote my expository essay. i also turned to another important resource that source is google. yes its great i can find just about anything on google. so i turned to this resource because there were a few things that i needed to know for my powerpoint so it could be complete and expand it. i needed to know of some different types of dreams and i needed in detail information of some known sleep disorders.now in picking out what types of dreams i was going to put in my powerpoint i had to chose between a few that i knew that wasnt going to spark my curiosity into making me want to further learn more and more about the subject. so i found five different types of dreams that i was okay to put in my powerpoint. the five types are ordinary, lucid, telepathic, premonitory, and nightmares. and i also added three sleep disorders to my powerpoint. they are sleep walking, sleep talking, and sleep paralysis. now i could go into detail about everything that i put into my powerpoint but that would defeat the whole purpose of me making it so i will not go into detail about what i put into my powerpoint. plus i am too lazy to do all of that typing all over again. NOW OK FOR EVERY PERSON WHO HAS READ THIS ENTRY I AM IN NEED OF YOUR ASSISTANCE. I HAVE NO CLUE ON WHAT COLORS MY BACKGROUND IS GOING TO BE. SO I NEED YOU THE READER TO GIVE ME IDEAS ON WHAT THE COLORS FOR MY BACKGROUND WILL BE. SO PLEASE AND THANK YOU! OH YEAH FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW THIS PPT IS AN ABBREVIATION FOR POWERPOINT."

"event","last night i couldnt sleep at all. i kept waking up and i had these really weird dreams. one of them was like i had stole this yacht and was driving it around and there was these people in cars that had landed on top of the yacht that were just odd. because they did this freaky dance it looked like they were drowning in mid air. also i had dreams that felt just a bit too real it creeped me out this one dream where i was in some park and there  was this girl that was like holding me but i couldnt see her face or nothinbut i knew it was a girl cause she talked to me. she had a very soothing voice but it was weird cause i felt like there was someone in my bad holding me for real. i woke up and there was nobody there. it was just plain weird. those were the only dreams i could remember. yeah but that was last night now lets talk about today. today was pretty cool school wise because i got most of my friends to sign my yearbook. and in my spanish class our teacher wasnt here and the substitute didnt show up so we like didnt do nothing at all. but listened to music. today is my nephews 14th birthday today. i called him and wished him a happy birthday and we might hang out or something later on tonight. or maybe this weekend.
oh yeah just between u and me my birthday is in exactly four months from today and i am excited because i will be 16."

"event","my weekend was ok i guess. i went to the we love homewood day celebration thing for the first tim since i moved here. it was not as boring as i thought it was going to be. which was probably because i just hung out with coung and paul for most of it. they r pretty cool so we had fun. while i was there i made my mom and two sisters mothers day gift because my mom is my mom and my sisters r like my mom. i got my mom a picture frame, my sister Destiny a purse(this is who i live with), and my other sister Camisha a basket. well actually i didnt make i just glued some flowers made of felt on it. at the wlhdct there was this band called Hidden Element they ok not the best that i have heard only because i have never been to any of the jam band show things. but anyway there were these four guys moshing to them  it was so lame. so we have these little police people called explorers or something i dont know. they surrounded the four guys so they got in trouble. it was quite funny to me.then i walk around so more until i left to get ready to march in the parade. which i might just have to say sucked so incrdibly bad because i cant seem to stay in rhytm for some reason so people were yelling at me to get in step like the whole entire time. then i went home and got something to eat watched a little television then went  to sleep. sunday mothers day i woke sore from the waist down for some reason. but it didnt really hurt though. so we went and picked up my mom for mothers day. we took her to the galleria to get her nails done. afterwards we went to golden corral to get something to eat. oh yeah we were with my cousin holly too. she is really cool because she just tells it like it is u know. she doesnt sugarcoat stuff and i admire that trait in her. so we go to my home and sit and chill for a little while. my mom started to act weird like she will say really weird things but enough about that i showed them my yearbook then my other sister went home but not fore she took my mom and holly home. then i ironed clothes then went to sleep. 
wlhdct=we love homewood day celebration thing duh!"

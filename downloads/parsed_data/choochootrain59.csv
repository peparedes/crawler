"event","Just got back from mary's after an eventful day and night. 

*^*Morning*^*
Yesterday I went over to mary's after watching X-files *Awesome show*.  We hung out outside playing with the hose *the GARDEN hose you sickos* and we, mostly me, talked on the phone with gregory. Then Lane came in her shinny red car that almost ran over me. Then Hailey and I were in the mood for Mc-E-Ds so we rode over there on our retarded bikes and well lets just say it wasnt pretty. We came back and had DEEP talks. WOOT WOOT!!! 

!~Afternoon~!
My posse, teehee just kidding, and I went down to Mill Ave. and went to see shrek 2 but we had timne before so we just went o some store and we missed like half the movie so we decided not to go. 

#~# Night#~#
Hailey's Dad came to pick her up and Lane and I stayed over and had more DEEP convo in the truck. Then we traveled back inside and tried to watch LOTR 3 while Lane made my wonderful journal you see here!!! *Im prolly messing it up somehow though cause im retarded*
Anyways we all fell asleep right away.

~<<Morning>>~

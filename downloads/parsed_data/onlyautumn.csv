friday me and jenna are going to drink since she is getting drug tested in a couple months :P she has to get one for soccer. i dont think it will show up though, even if we don't drink, because she didnt smoke too much on friday and she didnt before that either. and usually it gets outta there in a couple weeks - a month anyway. but we got some advice from jordan who got tested a while ago for court and he smokes SO much, and he just drank a couple weeks before and nothing showed up. so that's cute.

i hate les miserables!!!!!!!

i have a french test tomorrow. tonight i'm going tanning and then to euphoria to buy inscense and hemp and beads for jewelry. i really like that class, it goes by fast and i like duncans sister. she's nice. but then i am going to go to homers and get the new bright eyes cds because i am anxious to hear them!! and i have a homers gift certificate so yeah.

ben gives me something to look forward to and i can't decide if i like it or not. 

i like him though.

joey this kid with a huge ass yelled at peter because peter was making fun of brady beran! it was so funny. rich girl by gwen stefani is a cute song, it makes me wanna dannnncee. i have been liking sublime and bob marley a lot lately. and the red house painters and minus the bear. and john mayer. that was basically all the bands on the cd i just made for myself. I REALLY LIKE IT THOUGH. nicks parents are going out of town so he is probably having a party at his house. THAT WILL PROBABLY BE REALLY FUN I HATE TO ADMIT O(@*)#$()%OWIUERJF he gets his liscense soon too! !@$%

lately i have not been missing brendan at all! i have not been emo at all, either. well, yesterday i cried for really no reason but it was almost like i was forcing myself. it was really weird. i felt like i should be sad about brendan. i don't know, lately he has just not been in my thoughts or anything or making me sad. it really helps that i have him blocked i think and it also helps when me and ben vent to each other about how stupid he is! W#($*@#)( i wish i had a job. i have no money lately. it sucks. well, right now i have 15 dollars and so i am going to spend that on the hemp & beads. 

sam hubka really pisses me off! mimi is pregnant. terry yelled at marcus payne today because he ALWAYS makes fun of me and says i look like wedsnday from the adams family. but i dont' really care because he sounds like the weatherman.

anna was quiet today. dillon went to court today and he either gets out of ac or goes to treatment. i kind of hope he goes to treatment because to be honest i dont really want him at southeast. but if he gets out he will either go back to the private school he was at before or go to southeast. ewww."

"event","a love/hate thing. whatever, i just wanted someone to stand still with me.


i love christmas lights in my room, and hot chocolate in bed with sex and the city and harry potter and my writing assignment, and the sims on a saturday night, and on the roof with a + j at 1am, and i love the late night conversations with ben about all sorts of stuff. i love knowing the weekends will be spent with just those two and knowing we are all okay with that. 

it's weird how much closer we've gotten. i expected us to grow apart. 

i swear you've got me all wrong, but you got me."

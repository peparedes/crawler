"event","they....made fun of me last night.
they didn't know, 
but- it hurt.

they laughed at my ribs...
my hip bones.



it made me feel even more self conscious...


I mean..it didn't help that I was already in a fucking bikini.




I hate myself.

and I can't breath...
I feel like I've ran for hours on end-
I just, can't catch my breath.





It's only been
               one
                   full
                        day.
suck it up."

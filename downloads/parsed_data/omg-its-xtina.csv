"event","well, the past two days have been MOST interesting. right now i just got home, and lauren is completely drunk. and shes talking to my dog. its making me laugh in that, ""your weird and i dont really know what to do so im just going to laugh""-way. so last night we all went to scotts apartment and i drank a quarter of a bottle of peppermint vodka, i was soo completely fucked. this kid was like waving light sabers in my face while his girlfriend was in the bathroom throwing up, and yeah we'll just leave that little ""issue"" at that lol. 

so anywho, im pretty sure that me and ashley were the drunkest people, considering we were passed out in the backseat. i remember waking up and she was on the floor board...or something. and i supposedly threw myself off the bed a few times, and then got scared of a box of purses under ashleys bed.

or something.

Today i had the worst hangover ive ever had in my life! i threw up in the middle of IHOP...and then came home and threw up some more, and i NEVER throw up. it sucked.

and tonight lauren drank alot of bacardi, and now shes fucked. 

shes looking at me, and its kind of creeping me out.

now shes dancing.

so tomorrow is my moms birthday. wooo! *sings birthday song* me and lauren are gunna clean the house really good and make her dinner. cause we're broke and cant afford anything else. and i think thats about all for right nowwwww, im going to bed. i still feel like shit. hah! goodnight <33"

"event","its been forever since ive updated this thing. So im trying to figure out what to write, cause if i write something TOO deep in thought then i'll never stop, and if i dont then...this entry would be a complete waste of my life, SO im trying to find a happy medium. 

Well anyway, this week pretty much was the most boring week ive had all summer, mainly because i had to stay home and clean for this stupid appraisal. theres only two more weeks of summer left, then one year of high school, then im out. So, interesting stuff thats happened lately. 


Ya i got nothing.

Maybe thats because im not in a really good mood right now. however, i just saw an RV and that soo reminded me of the time me and lauren went ""RV shopping"" at the oviedo mall when they had their little expo thing. and lauren was SERIOUSLY thinking of living in an RV when we graduate & go to college. do you know how fun that would be?

let me give you some examples.

""can i go back to my house to grab my book? its right over there in the parking lot.""
""Yeah last week i lived in california, next week im thinking colordo.""
'Where do you live?' ---""where do you WANT me to live?""

lmao. i guess you had to be there. but that was pretty funny.

not to mention the fact that we had a huge cooler from the beach in the back of her car.

""we were looking for an upgrade, because this car just isnt working out for us anymore.""

god i love her. lmao.

haha okay im done sitting here laughing by myself. im pretty sure my mom thinks im on drugs..

im going to sea world now. much love <333"

and my poor freakin horse...he couldnt walk at ALL, we tried to get him out of his stall and he wont even put his back foot on the ground, its swollen like a ballon, so he couldnt even move, he had to almost like hop. and its not that easy for a horse to hop. ya know? so i had to move his water buckets and hay together so that he didnt have to move to get to both of them, i feel so bad for him. hes on stall rest right now only b/c he cant move. seeing him like that made me want to cry, poor baby.

"event","Tribute to the nice girls. To the nice girls who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because they must be doing something wrong. This is for the girls who don't give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've heard a thousand times. This is for the girls who understand that they aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either, for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the slightest glance, whisper, touch, because somehow they are able to keep alive that hope that maybe... maybe this time he'll have understood. This is an homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than they should for guys who don't deserve their attention. This is for those girls who have been in the trenches, who have watched other girls time and time again fake up and make up the guys in their lives without saying a word. This is for the girls who have been there from the beginning and have heard the trite words of advice, from ""there are plenty of fish in the sea,"" to ""time heals all wounds."" This is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they are, who know that they deserve better, who are seeking to find it."

"event","Well since im sick and cant stop coughing =/ i was like. im going to post another journal entry! woo. well anyways, i decided to use my old screen name because all my other ones have this annoying virus that sends stupid links to people on my buddy list...and it keeps delete ppl off my buddy list, its really freaking annoying and my old sn dosent have it so im going to use it instead. most of you probly already have it because i used it for like 3 years haha, but in case you dont its JuMpErBaBe33 (its a horsebackriding thing). So someone keeps IMing my cell phone..and then when i come online to see who it is, they either block me or try to go invisible (yeahhh like i dont notice?), but its weird b/c its not like their saying anything mean to my phone usually its just like ""hey whats up"". but its still kind of gay they wont talk to me when i can acctually talk back without spending a freaking dollar..

alright. well that was kind of pointless.."

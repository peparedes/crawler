3) we always pay close attention to the balls
4) we make slidin into places seem easy
5) we don't let you foul out
6) we love goin in for extra innings
7) we switch positions at least 7 times a game and we have great coordination with BOTH hands
8) we are ready for ANYTHING that is coming our way
9) we like keeping the lights on for night games

Today I slept in, ate McDonalds(blew the whole skinny healthy thing), then went to Photosho Boy's and helped him take his family pictures....actually I just stood there and then clicked the button whenever he had to jump in the picture, then I came home and saw my baby Charlie and he bit me.....End of weekend.

1.) Adam and I have officially been together for 365 days(sounds longer when u put it in days)......thats a freaking LOOONG time, but it only feels like 3 months. We went to Chicago and stayed at what was s'pose to be a kick ass hotel (allegrochicago.com).....they cahrged us for the HONOR bar and we didnt realize it til we ate/drank a fourth of it all.....jipped us on the black and white tiled bathroom floor......the flat screen tv wasnt flat.....2 hotel emplpyees walked in our room twice in the morning (wtf?)....but all in all it was fun and i got to take pictures and be with my boy :)

2.) Charlie has doggie superpowers and knows how to turn off the tv when he doesnt like what you're watching.

3.) I have to start back to school in a month or so. Not looking forward to that but its the last 16 weeks I will ever have to go to school.

4.) I'm worried about money and what I'm gonna do after I graduate. Dont wanna live at home forever but its stupid to find an apartment when i can live at home for free and will spend every night at Adams anyways. 

5.) I started playing slowpitch softball this summer...its pretty fun......not quite as intense as fastpitch but i've hit 1 homerun and 1 grandslam(we still lost?).

6.) I need to start working out consistently because i eat WAY too many cheeseburgers and now I drink occasionally.......so if i dont when i'm 30 i will either be dead or fat......or both.

on that note......its almost time to go home......YAY!"

SO as u can guess i'm BORED BORED BORED. theres nothing to do and its so nice outside. i hate having an inside job sometimes. i wish i was a construcion flag holder lady....or not. but i think it would be fun to mow yards in the summer. you're outside, getting a tan , and exercising. im also working on consolidating and applying for another student loan for the fall. pain in my ass. i found out how much i will owe when i graduate and i think i should just sign up for welfare now. not good. 
 On another note i want to go camping realy realy bad. I hope the black panther doesnt eat us when we go but we will be drunk so it might not hurt as much.  i get so bored everytime i try updating in this thing that i lose all train of thought and ...i should go now. 

p.s. if u know of anyone interested in buying a Nikon film camera let me know i want to get rid of that bitch. :)"

"event","today is graduation day and i'm not included in the ceremony, FUCK! i forgot to take 12 hours so i get to go again next semester woo hoo. actually i just decided work was more important so i only took the minimum 12 hours a semester. i was reading other peoples journals and everyone is all depressed about graduating and leaving and i dont get it at all. maybe because i dont live on campus and havent experienced ""college life"" on that level. i'm sad because none of my friends are coming home this summer except for one and she will hang out with her other friends as usual anyways. thank god for adam or i would have no life. i played 2 softball games this week. OUCH is how i feel about that(sore legs). its awesome to be able to play again but slowpitch is just not the same as fastpitch. First off theres NO helmets so im running the bases and these crazy ass 45 year old women that cant throw a ball and hit the broad side of a barn if their life depended on it are throwing balls all over the place and coming within inches of my face. SCARY! the second game i played with a team of ALL lesbians, and i'm talking manly lesbians....i felt like i was working at McDonalds all over again. they were funny they kept calling me dude and going ""hey man nice hit.""....i'm like i'm a girl but thanks. i think one of them was hitting on me but i'm not sure, i can never tell. they were cool though and all younger which was cool cause everybody on my team is like 30+. work sucks ass today....the printer is making Josh mental and i have to remake a print that was done like 2 years ago and make it look ""identical"" to the original one. ya fuck you lady that scratched it. why the hell do i have to come to work on saturday for 3 hours anways? i should be used to it i've done it for the last 5 years. 

my best friends graduation party is today and i made her a card that says ""Happy Graduation!! You suck, can I have your diploma?""...haha i'm so nice."

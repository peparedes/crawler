"event","""SO HERE IT IS -
<b>no hype</b>
<i>no gloss</i>
<u>no pretense</u>

just me...
<b><i>stripped.</i></b>""

i can be the best thing you've ever had or can be your worst enemy. i can be selfish but also completely selfless to the point where i'm only screwing myself over. although i can be selfish i am never stingy. i act like i never get jealous but i can really freak out sometimes. i'll always put my guard up if i don't want you to know something about me no matter how ignorant i'm being. i hate money because i love it so damn much. i can't save money, i'm irresponsible, and i'm lazy. i can't remember the last time i've been completely and utterly happy in my life after mid-2003. i'm always thankful for what i have. i'm always appreciative. when i love someone i really love them with all of my heart: family, friend, boyfriend, whatever. i will love and honor you until i am blue in the face - that's a promise - even though i may not always show it. i love feeling loved and knowing i have people who care about me but it also makes me feel constricted...like someone is always on my back criticizing what i am doing and forgetting whose life it really is. i'm overall a very positive person but i am harder on myself than anyone would ever think. it's hard to find people who will love you no matter what you do or what you feel. i believe in myself but can become very negative when things go wrong. sometimes i don't know whether i am striving to become a person that i secretly crave becoming or am trying to be someone i'm not. i can be fake 'cause sometimes it's just easier. i laugh when i'm uncomfortable. i always need to be liked. i HATE when people don't like me. i cry a lot more than i want to admit. i don't apologize if i don't need to. i always stick up for myself. i don't know if i will ever be able to fully fall in love. despite that, i would NEVER cheat. i'm a lot more mature than i act sometimes - sit down and have a conversation with me and you'll know. it bothers me more than anything when my mother is disappointed in me. if someone breaks my trust, i don't trust them again. i'm amazingly insecure and as the love of my life ashlee simpson would say, beautifully broken.

now let's take the heat off of me...

i can't stand people who lie. i can't stand people who are <u>always</u> fake. i can't stand people who have a field day talking about me behind my back but when they get to my face they're like ""durr i didn't say a-a-anything""...nice try. i can't stand people who always draw attention to themselves. i hate drama kings and queens and freaking princes and princesses while i'm at it. sometimes i can't help but get wrapped up in it, i know, but who can? i can't stand people who say/do one thing but feel another...or say one thing and do another. i can't stand people who don't appreciate when they have a good thing. not to mention come back when they've lost it and cry about how they miss it. OH WELL. i'm sick of the he says she says bullshit. i can't stand when people walk all over me when all i wanna do is be a friend.

i've gone from 17 years old to about 35 in a week. i've just been having the ongoing biggest epiphany of my life. things that i used to enjoy/would make me laugh make me wanna punch someone when i see them do it. i'm not going to be my old me anymore. i hate that person. i've been craving a new personality for so long and here it is. i will no longer have tolerance for people who want to have anything to do with messing up my life or hurting my feelings. i'm always always always going to be honest. if any of this scares you then walk away because i'm done sugar-coating things for people. i'm finally going to live for me.

i just wanna be alone. the minute i have some alone time MY MOM PULLS IN THE DRIVEWAY. i just flipped out. there is nothing more frustrating than wanting privacy and not being able to have it. i am sick of feeling imprisoned in my own house.

You don't know me like you knew me
You stopped listening
The moment that I needed you the most

You can't see me like you saw me
Truth comes easy
But it's hard for you to pull me from the ground

So I scream, scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word cuts me inside and leaves me worse
There's no way back
And what if there was?
You'd still be you and I'd still need
To say goodbye

Maybe you don't love me
Like I love you
'Cause the broken in you doesn't make me run

There is beauty in the dark side
I'm not frightened
Without it I could never feel the sun

So I scream, scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word cuts me inside and leaves me worse
There's no way back
And what if there was?
You'd still be you and I'd still need
To say goodbye

Nothing will change no matter what you say
I'm still gonna be the same
The harder we try
The harder that we fight
Can't get it right

So I scream, scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word cuts me inside and leaves me worse
There's no way back
And what if there was?
You'd still be you and I'd still need
To say goodbye

Just say goodbye
Say goodbye..."

"event","so i'm pretty sick of complaining to everyone and feeling like i am a huge pain in the ass and an overexaggerater so i am just going to talk in this thing.

first of all, i feel like absolute death. i'm wicked glad that everything i do during the day hurts my body. typing this effing journal entry is making my arms, fingers, and back cramp up. putting the plaster on my mask in art this morning made my shoulders burn. i have never been so tired in my life. my skin hurts and it's freezing. my heart hurts. my throat is on fire. my head is pounding. my body is lifeless and weak. and the worst thing of all is that when i called my mom to tell her to make me a doctor's appt. she got mad at me and just said ""so, basically you're telling me that you're not going to work tonight?"" COOL MOM. listen. i have a VERY high tolerance for illness and pain and i'm not a complainer and i DON'T overexaggerate. when i start complaining, whining, crying about something physical, it's usually pretty effing bad. people just look at me like i have four heads when i explain how i feel...like i'm making up symptoms. it's really awesome especially when your own mother doesn't even believe that you're sick.

second of all, i am so consumed with numbness. this isn't comfortable numbness either. i have no emotion anymore except anger and frustration. i just feel so fed up lately and exhausted physically and emotionally. i feel left out and ignored and disliked. i feel myself starting to alienate myself from those around me and i'm trying to stop but the closer i try to bring myself to those around me, the more i feel like i am being pushed away. i don't know why i feel this way. i am so consumed with emotion that i'm starting to forget who i am right now.

third of all, i have never had such a huge hate for anyone in my life. i don't like to hate anyone nor did i ever think i would hate anybody in my life. well, i do. oh well. deal with it. it's not going to change. although i'll always adore you and think the world of you, i don't miss you. and i don't love you. i hate you.

fourth of all, people are so wrapped up in their own goddamn lives that they forget about people around them and what they do for them. take your head out of your ass...THANKS.

fifth of all, i have been realizing lately that the people i thought were good and true and loving actually only care about themselves and don't care who they hurt in the process. all they care about is if they are happy. most of you know who i'm talking about. most of you can't stand this person/these people either. so i'm not alone. ssiicckk.


so this entry is wicked negative. but it's been a while since i have been negative and it's been a while since i expressed myself. sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo here it is. k great.

"event","hm. i don't think i will ever understand why i always take the roll as the great listener to a bestfriend's boyfriend. i give the best relationship advice and always seem to cheer the ""relationshipees"" up.

if this is the case...why can't i take my own advice and find love for myself? why am i constantly giving advice in agony to men i wish i had? okay. maybe not <i>that</i> man...just one for my own. some occasions, however, not with my friends' boyfriends, i do give advice to the men i wish i had. the actual men.

i don't even know how this came up in my head. i just thought about it randomly.

and it sucks. i want love.

lol but to sidetrack...i just need to express how happy i am that jared and i never ended up together seriously and how my feelings ended so long ago. it was perfect timing. he'll never change. i am hearing more stories about how he is back to old ways and i am so glad that i am finally that girl that can look him in the eye and say fuck you.

*yay for getting over assholes*

i love you all. goodbye."

"event","well maybe person 1 was wrong in yelling at person 3 at the lunch table and maybe that was immature. well...it happened so there is nothing any of us numbered people can do about it. so person 1 apologizes for coming off as immature and as if she was over-reacting but sometimes when person 1 gets angry she explodes. she was angry. she exploded.

person 1 also apologizes for being hypocritical. she was saying things that she hated that she was definitely doing herself. so she apologizes and wants to put it behind her and stop doing these hypocritical actions and stop telling people not to do things that she shouldn't be doing either.

however, person 1 has a legit reason why she has not come to ""person 5"" and that is because she knows that it will explode with anger and ridiculousness. talks between person 1 and person 5 never just involve talking. they involve yelling and misunderstanding and arrogance on both of their parts. person 1 feels that her problems with person 5 are personal having to do with her and the way she FEELS and therefore doesn't know how to fix it. she doesn't feel that talking will fix it because it will still go on. she will still always feel smaller than person 5. she will still always feel as though person 5 is constantly criticizing her even if she doesn't have to speak to do so. that is just how person 1 feels and she can't help it. she tried to deal with it on her own for a little while...but...it didn't work. she felt as though in telling person 5 these problems she would just become defensive and the whole situation would become so much worse. perhaps person 1 was wrong. i guess she will never know unless person 5 wants to know about her feelings or is still willing to talk about hers. it seems as though it is a lost cause by now...but maybe it isn't. maybe there is hope. i guess person 1 will just have to wait and see where this is headed.

so, in a nutshell, person 1 is very aware that she needs to grow up in such situations. she knows that she doesn't always deal with her emotions in a way that she should and that when she is emotional she tends to forget about other people's feelings. she knows this. she is working on it. as person 1 recently stated in a journal entry...she is done. meaning done sitting back and watching herself crumble in a way the people she hates do. meaning done sitting back and watching her self criticize the world when she hypocritically needs to fix herself.

as person 1 always says...she is not afraid to admit when she was wrong. she is not looking for pity or even a comment if no numbered people want to leave one. she just had some secret intentions and thoughts and feelings to get off of her chest. that's the basis of a journal.


but person 1 has senior pictures in about 45 minutes so she is going to go do her hair. she's excited.

"event","so i have some things to say.

i realized today who my real friends are. i always thought that i was better off with tons of friends rather than just a small group of close ones. well...i realized that it doesn't matter how many...it's how much they love you and how well they treat you. it's quality...not quantity. i have 7 real friends. now, i don't want to read any comments to this entry saying ""am i one of your true friends?"" because if you have to second guess yourself, chances are you aren't. when i say true friends i mean the ones that i know will not tell ANYTHING that i say is a secret...even if it's that i like strawberry jelly better than grape jelly (which i do by the way). the friends that i don't have to worry about talking about me when i am not around. the friends that i know know their boundaries and what is and is not their business. those friends. i have 7 of them. and i love them more than i can explain. some of them can't read this entry but the ones that can...i hope you know who you are and that i am always here for you. i hope you all trust me as much as i trust you and love me as much as i love you. you all mean the world to me.

amanda freaking lorraine - you are heaven sent. legit. we will always ""stay bestest friends"" because that's how it is been from fifth grade. damn straight. no one will ever tear us apart and you have a special place in my heart that is irreplaceable. I LOVE YOU.

i am just so happy lately. despite what is going on...life is effing awesome. i am really excited about school and college and i am on a really good track right now with all of that and i am really jumping into college preparation. i'm pumped. things at home are awesome. my mom is the best person i have ever met in my life. my dad and i are getting along really well and i absolutely love his fiance. i am very excited about them getting married and possibly starting a family. yay. i'm wicked happy.


LET ME SIDE TRACK FOR A SECOND. SERIOUSLY WE ARE SENIORS IN HIGH SCHOOL. JUST GROW UP. I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU SO JUST GET OVER IT. (that goes for anyone and everyone)



okay so my point: if people want to be dramatic, leave me out of it because i have had enough. this is supposed to be the best year of our lives and i intend to keep it that way. i am going to have to step up and say...i'm done."

last night a guy from my work asked me out on a date. i said yes because i really like him. but...the more i think about it...the more i'm doubting it (like i always do). but...this time...it has nothing to do with him. usually once i start getting into a guy i will find a bunch of little things that drive me nuts about him and i will be like okay i don't like him anymore. it's not like that with him though. he is seven years older than me. at first that didn't bother me at all and now it really, really does for some reason. read this conversation that i had with my wonderful chum timmy coop. i'd love some feedback on it. usually i am a lot more level headed than this and can handle my own things but i need all the advice i can get on this matter.

kaymac3710: hey i'm sorry to bother you with my retarded problems but i really need someone's advice right now
T12 C O O P128: do tell
kaymac3710: okay so remember last night when john and i were talking about the kid who was going to ask me out?
T12 C O O P128: kinda
kaymac3710: okay well we were talking about billy
kaymac3710: from meat...the old shiftleader
T12 C O O P128: ya
kaymac3710: and he asked me out to dinner and a movie last night and i said yes because him and i have had kind of a crush on each other for a little while but now i don't know if this is what i want.
kaymac3710: he's 7 years older than me.
T12 C O O P128: well if he makes u happy go for it
kaymac3710: i know but i was thinking about it last night and that is so weird. i mean...a bf in highschool is usually someone that you can call when you're with your friends and be like hey let's meet up and chill or someone that you can just have come over and hang out and watch movies or someone to take to the football games. i can't call a 24 year old and be like hey come hang out with a bunch of seniors and watch us do stupid shit you did 7 years ago already
T12 C O O P128: lol true
kaymac3710: i mean i was wicked happy when he asked me last night because i have wanted it for like over a month and the age thing never bothered me before but it always bothered him so now that it doesn't get to him anymore it really gets to me all of a sudden. it's different for him to invite me to go out with his friends cause...i can pass for their age with the way i look and how i act but if i'm walking around hand in hand with him he is CLEARLY too old for me. he's gonna look like my effing brother lol
kaymac3710: but i don't want to go to him and be like yeah i changed my mind. i'm uneasy about this because he just got the balls to ask me out last night. fuck. i'm so confused.
T12 C O O P128: lol well u gotta tell him what u jus told me
T12 C O O P128: jus explain how  a bf should be able to chill with u n ur friends
kaymac3710: i think that would make him feel like shit though
kaymac3710: he's already wicked insecure. that's something that intimidates me because i don't want to hurt him. he hurts easily.
kaymac3710: i know you probably don't know what to say and that's okay i just really needed someone to vent to
kaymac3710: thank you
T12 C O O P128: nah im sorry im tryin to fill out college applications
kaymac3710: lol it's okay
T12 C O O P128: jus tell him exactly what u told me
kaymac3710: yeah i guess that's the only thing i can do. i'm scared shitless though. he's gonna think i'm crazy...telling him that i have this huge crush on him and now all of a sudden i have doubts
kaymac3710: i guess that's being a woman.
kaymac3710: we're SO confusing. lol
kaymac3710: the only things i'm ever sure of are those that i can't have. the only feelings i'm ever sure i have for people are those that already have feelings for someone else. how lucky is that? lol
T12 C O O P128: =(
T12 C O O P128: u'll find someone
T12 C O O P128: just explain to billy how much u like him but the age hing isnt gonna work out
T12 C O O P128: if ur nice enough about it im positive hes not gonna think ur crazy or ne thing
kaymac3710: alright. you're right.
kaymac3710: thank you so much
T12 C O O P128: thats what im here for

just. get. over. yourself.



PS - i am well aware that i am doing the same kind of thing right now but it is for a particular reason. believe it or not...in my situation if i act fake, it actually makes me look like the better person for ""not caring"". ally knows what i'm talking about.

thank you to my friends who love me and stood up for me and KNOW that i am not an attention craver.
i love you.

"event","Anemia can be difficult to identify because early symptoms may be mild. In addition, <b>it is easy to mistake some symptoms of anemia for symptoms of</b> serious disease or <b>medication side effects</b>. As symptoms of anemia worsen, however, <b>they can significantly affect a person's quality of life</b>. 
 <b>It is common for people to ignore symptoms of anemia or attribute them to other causes...</b> 
 Anemia can make it <b>hard to find the energy to enjoy hobbies or other leisure activities, or even to complete basic tasks at home or at work</b>. Particularly for a person with a serious disease, the fatigue, weakness and other symptoms associated with anemia can compound the challenges of coping with the serious disease. 

Major symptoms of anemia include: 

<b>Extreme fatigue 
Weakness</b> 
Shortness of breath 
<b>Confusion or loss of concentration 
Dizziness/fainting/feeling faint
Pale skin</b> (including decreased pinkness of the lips, gums, lining of the eyelids, nail beds and palms)
<b>Rapid heart beat</b> (tachycardia) 
<b>Feeling very cold
Feeling very hot 
Sadness/depression
Severe increase/decrease in appetite
Nausea/frequent vomiting</b>

the last few days have been really fun. i just have to say that i LOVE my friends. i have the best ones, man. by far. =)

there have been some things going on in my life that my friends don't understand. they don't understand me and why i do some of the things that i do. and you know what? that's okay. not everyone needs to understand EVERYTHING all of the time. there are things about my friends' lives that i don't understand but i try hard not to criticize. it's their life and whatever makes them happy they can do. i trust my friends' judgements and if they think/know something is good for them or they know how to make it good for them...more power to them. i may not understand it...but i will accept it for them because it's not about what i want it's about what they want.
that's why it has been frustrating lately to hear my friends tell me they are sick of the situation(s) i am in and that they don't understand. i know they don't but they don't have to. i know what i am doing. i am being cautious and wise about it. faith is what i need. it will be helpful that my friends believe that i know what i am doing and that as long as i am happy there are no problems. i know that they are just looking out for me and i appreciate that more than anything but at the same time...i am a big girl. no one can FULLY understand a situation unless they have been in it to experience the tiny little details. those are the most important. those can be the things that can make or break a friendship. those are the things i don't always share because they are personal and don't need to be heard by everyone around me.

okay i am not making any sense so i am just going to stop. i know what i'm trying to say so hopefully whoever reads this will too.

lloovvee,
me"

i don't understand why when i am fucked over that i am always the one to feel as though she should be relighting the flame. i am always the one who wants to say ""i love you"" again no matter what that person said/did to me. maybe i'm wrong. maybe this person is going through exactly what i am going through. but i wouldn't know because they show no emotion towards my life nor even my existence. i don't know how to get the words right. i wish i could get over problems with my friends without always wanting to be their friend again. i wish i could just be like...okay...you did this to me and i accept that...but i don't want to ever speak to you again. but i can't. i love too deep.

but who loves me? perhaps i don't even care. well...i know who loves me.
i'm too preoccupied with life with now to be prepared for...well...anything.

i am wrapped up in two extremes. with another friendship...i am so mean. SO MEAN. and i don't care. i don't care that i am hurting them at all. i am the first person they've fucked over that is giving them a taste of their own medicine and they don't know what to do with themselves. and i don't care. i want them to suffer like i suffered. i want them to cry like i cried. i want them to be frustrated as hell just like i was. and the sadder they get...the angrier i get. it's so unhealthy. when i am talking to them i am the bitch from hell but when i am just sitting around thinking about them...like now...i just want to call them in tears and tell them that i don't want to be harsh anymore. that i want to let them love me...because i know they do. but they don't know how to handle it. they don't know how to handle anything. they should be alone. and yet...i'm always the one who doesn't want to make them face things on their own. i don't know why i always feel as though i should help out and love and support when i got none of that within the past years. all i know is my overwhelming emotion is anger. intense...immense...anger. and i suppose i should just roll with it. i should keep being defensive and stand up for myself. but am i really angry or is it just my front to prove that i am not a toy? is it really how i feel or am i just trying to prove that i am my own, independent person? i refuse to be pushed around and i suppose this is how i show that.

i'm finally safe from hurt. i know now more than ever how to be and what to avoid...but i'm still not happy. i hate them whether they are in or out of my life. both of them. on some level.



love. me."

i love you. i miss you. i'm so glad you're back in my life. i'm so lucky to have you. kiss me. now. make me laugh like i used to. i miss the way you smell. i want your hugs back. i want to forgive you. i need you. i hate you. you still lose me in your eyes. there's no way i could live without you.

i really relate to this song hardcore. especially this part:
<i>2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
<b>I don't love him</b>...winter just wasn't my season
Yeah we walk through the doors so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
<b>Hypocrites you're all here for the very same reason</b>

Cause you can't jump the track
We're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
<b>No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands</b>
And breathe...just breathe...breathe</i>

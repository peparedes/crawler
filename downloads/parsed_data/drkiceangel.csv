Cold, Reliable, Praticle.
Saturn is the planet that in earthly life serves to<br>signify restrictions and obstacles you must<br>face if your personal goals are incorrect for<br>you or you have a karmic debt that needs<br>paying. Saturn's placement in your chart can<br>indicate areas in your life that you will need<br>to be particularly diligent about trying to<br>change or work with. Thus Saturn has been<br>called both, the planet of fate and the Lord of<br>Karma. Saturn symbolizes the course of time and<br>patience, tradition, and experience. At the<br>best of times it helps to consolidate.

"event","well on friday we celebarted v-day. I didnt think i was gonna get anything from any one but from my friends at the table. But I did i got a rose but i dont know who it was from, im set of figuring it out(Many people were helping me too).
I gave out my candy and stuff, it was wierd cause 4 guys said will u marry me when i gave it to them, lol it was funy. Also i had a chocolate heart to give away that my mum bought me to give to a special person, but i didnt know who to give it to, Since im giing albert something else, so i asked people who i should give it too, everyone said Ian, but i think him and nicole are going back out so i dont want nicole getting mad at me since she is a friend, so before i go to soccer practice i see owen, i call him and tell him can u give this to jarrod, since they both play baseball, not that i really like jarrod or anything  but next to ian and albert Jumper (who i would have givin it to but he was at a wrestling meet)jarrod would most likely be my next choice.
 SO i went to practice, and we played with the boys, we played a coed game, it was pretty fun, we have our first jv game this tuesday, Yay!
 WE couldnt get in the locker rooms cause all the doors were locked so we had to go through the boys locker room, omg i saw ian without a shirt it was hot and i also belive it was collin, not sure i get him mixed up with an other guy, but it was hot. And i saw owen getting out of the shower in a pink towel, lol. Then i had to babysit that night for my parents and my tia fatima and tio oscar cause they went dancing.
 Saturday(v-day) was pretty boring, i satyed home while my dad and uncle worked and my mom and aunt went to chuckie cheese, then later my other aunt and uncle came over and it was like a vday feast but i didnt talk to them cause i dont like my aunt cause she a bitch towards my mother side of the family, she thinks shes better cause she from a rich mexican family, even tho my dads alot richer than them. but they spent the night last night. and now today im just sittin here in my room trying to avoid them, hopeing they'll leave."

"event","Josh T-G Is wonderful and i really like him. I wonder if he notices, hes like one of the only guys i can keep a stare with. He has the most beautiful blue eyes ive ever seen. And hes so kewl and funny, but im way to scared to tell him i like him. Plus he has a g/f. What can i do?
Then theres albert, hes very cute and hes like a skater, he use to be preppy cause i remember seeing him in abercrombie before but he changed. Hes really kewl i caould sit there and listen to him forever, buts hes shy so he doesnt talk to much. Even tho hes not the guy i imagine to be the perfect one i like him alot and would probably give up anything for him, even if he didnt like me."

"event","<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=5><STRONG><EM>Why</EM></STRONG> can't i ever find a guy thats right for me or one that is what i expected to be. I wish for once a guy would just come out and tell me he liked, guys like to make me guess, its fun for a bit but then its just makes me mad. I wish guys that i am attracted to were like really romantic and stuff. But no, life is unfair with me in that department, i don tknow y. LOL well oh well thats life.</FONT></P>

"event","hello. well today we disected a sheep brain. well actually 1 and a half. but it was really kewl. we only got to take off the dura mata today but it was lots of fun. But i feel sorry for the sheep lol one our brains was actually missing a chunk it was funny.we made up way of how he lost part of his brain. 
 Other than the sheep today was actually boring, nothing exciting had realy happened in my life recently. well yea, theres logan. He this kinda cute freshman(im a sophmore) i like him and he likes me but i doubt anything is going to happen,well maybe im not sure. Robyn is helping us out lol she like a messanger. He really funny and the exact type of guy ive been looking for.
But one of my best friends doesnt like him i dont know about the other one but i know vic doesnt. 
 But then theres albert (Albertito, lol.)he is the exact opposite of what i would ever look for in a guy (well almost not completely) but yet i always want to see him and i thikn i might be falling in love (maybe, maybe not)its wierd.
15, yup im 15 but havent had my quinceanera yet, ive been 15 for like over half a year and im barley gonna have it this may or june(my mom hasnt decided yet) but i cant wait till i have my big party.

Hey!

Whats up? nothing here. I am pretty tired. Today I went to school and did all this bullshit work. I came home and slept. Then woke up. Drea came over with her new car and what not. It is really nice I like it. I figure I am just not going to change my classes, because they will end up being easy and I need good grades. Tommorow I am going out with Drea... we don't know what the hell we are doing. I am fucking tired. Im gonna go now. Bye!

Hey!

Whats up? nothing much here...just chilling. Tonight.. I went to church with Mary and Jessy. I really like their church. It's been a long time since I have stuck with a church because I am very picky.. but I  dont feel like a complete idiot at this one. Tommorow me and Mary are going to the mall and probably to see a movie.. but I am not sure which one yet. I am sorta mad the break is over.. I like sleeping in late and not having to learn alot of bullshit which I will never use in my life. I talked to Reece today.. it was good to talk to him.. i missed him and I hadn't talked to him since the end of school last year. I have a shitload of New Years resolutions.. And I'm planning to kick my own ass and stick to them. Well. im gonna go now.

Hey Sluts!
Whats up? nothing much here. Just chillin. Bored.. and its New Years Eve. How sad lol... Wednsday I went to Mary's house and we went to her church and I spent the night. We watched Bruce Almighty and Man On The Moon, but Mary was knocked out by the middle of the first movie. The next day.. we went to Laser Quest in Fort Worth with the youth group.. it was fun. Man I tripped and fell so many times but nobody caught me. Then we came back from there and went back to her house. Me, Mary, Francesca, and Yoshie wathced White Chicks.. it was fun. Then we watched the OC.... Today I went and saw Meet the Fockers. It was fucking hilarious!! I couldn't stop laughing. And there was this little cute dog named Moses. He was sooo adorable. After that I went and rented 2 movies which were Collateral and Feeling Minnesota. Then went to Target and bought some stuff 4 me and Drea and Carrie's Christmas presents. Tommorow I want to go see The Darkness. Yah....I hope it's scary!!!! Well I'm gonna go now!

Hey!
Whats up? Nothin much here! Just chilling out. Listening to music. Today I went to my Grandaddys house cause thats wut we always do on Christmas Eve. We hung out and everything. Me and my cousin wached the movie Old School. I love that movie cause it is sooo funny. lol... ""WE'RE STREAKING....UP THROUGH THE QUAD TO THE GYMNASIUM LOL!"" Tommorow my Grandaddy is coming over around 12:30 to spend time with us. My cousin is staying at her house cause my step cousins kids Taylor and Alli are going over there.  But there mom is stupid.. I love her to death of course.. but she was doing good .. and off the drugs and she fucked up again! I heard my Aunt talking nd she was like when Taylor found out her mom fucked up again.. she cryed all day.. and Alli tried to take a pic of her and her mom to her and she threw it across the room. That made me really sad cause she is gonna probly suffer from depression and alot of problems when she is older.

Hey Whores!
Whats up? nothing much here. Just chillin listening to music. Today I didn't do anything at all. I helped my mom get ready for Christmas Eve. And I made this white chocolate popcorn that Paige told me how to make and it actually turned out pretty good. The day after Christmas I am supposed to be helping Crystal and April move into their apartment. That lucky whore Crystal gets to graduate this year.. i hate that I have to wait cause im fucking tired of school. Aw Fuck! I probably failed Spanish 2 again.. dammit. Oh well ...Im going to go now... im getting tired.
HAVE A GOOD CHRISTMAS!!

After that we went to his house and we were going to watch The Seed Of Chucky.. but he couldn't find it so we ended up watching Anaconda 2.  It was pretty good... there was this really sexy guy in it .. so i enjoyed it lol!!! Me and my Mom finished watching the movie Terms of Endearment.. tonight...It was sad .. it made me cry .. it was really good though. I want to see the movie Notebook again because it was sooo good. I start missing my Gram around this time of year. Because she always made it soo fun. And I loved her soooo much and we were soooo close. But I know she is here with me! Well I am going to go watch tv and go to bed cause im starting to get a little tired.

Hey!
Whats up? nothin here! Just chillin out and listening to music! I have exams this week, which fucking sux! But at the same time it kicks ass because I get to switch my classes! And i havent liked them much during this semester! I cant wait to graduate so I can and get the hell outta Texas and go to either Seattle or LA! Right now I am on a weight loss mission! and a mission to excersize and eating right! I am going to this gym called Lady of America.. which is good! but I need to stop cheating on the eating thing cause I am just cheating myself and beating myself down farther in the ground. I have another mission I am on also. To be a BITCH! which some of you are thinking why? Because my whole life I have let people walk over me because I am shy and dont like to make people mad. But I am trying to build up my confidence so i can basically tell people to FUCK OFF! I am also working on the whole thing where I speak my mind, stop feeling sorry for myself, get my ass up, and do something to work on my dreams and make them come true! Well I am going to go now!

Love Ya Bitchez!

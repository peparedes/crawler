"event","You know, everything was going so well. School, work and friends. I'm was comfortably pleased with my marks, money was not an issue and i was attending pubs and parties every weekend. I had time to resume my photography and music and i even met up with Kendra and Rory. Life was bliss ... 

Until I lost Lucia.

Admittedly I didn't think anything of it at 1st. I didn't really know the girl and she was interstingly dangerous. But as i spent more time working on my music collection late night, i would notice around 5-6 am  i would start to wonder how she was.

I stubbornly have refused to apologize thinking it was for the best. But it's not. It hit my square in the face when got back-stabbed by a friend, everything is too short, to be an angry, resentful and stupid person.

Why can't I stop thinking about her? She's one of the unique people i've identified. I've always sought out uniqueness, and latch onto it. I don't know why, perhaps i am searching for my own unique place, maybe i just don't want to be normal. But I can't let go, not before trying again.

So today i'm going to see her, for the 1st time in months. I often pictured myself like the admiral. Giving two words ""The book"" in response to the book she has of mine in which i want to get back. If she said anything i'd just say ""the book please"" and then walk off. 

Now I don't know what i'm going to say. I'll probably meet her at starbucks and she might very well claim ""i'm working"" which i can't blame her, because shes not a certified bartista.

No longer content to just see her thru the glass as I walk by, i'm going to apologize.

The apology of my life. 

""I could die for you, and I don't even know you"" is what i'll be thinking.

i mean.. who else would ever have watched Edward Scissorhands and been so into it as me...only Luce"

"event","So I wasn't really gonna write this journal anymore, until I made some friends as Ryerson. Mission Accomplished. So I suppose i'm going to update this whole layout and what not and try to look cool. As if cool was some tangiable, ( it's really just peer pessure).

And for the update

Finally got my Ryecard. and i don't look bald! hurra! Already I'm being know as the kid with the black hat, as I have never taken it off once in the last 2 weeks. I got to school with some fairly weird kids. One of them is named Cosmic..Ok. However, This one girl looks like a friend of mine, and not jsut looks but is perhaps her twin!!!

Now i've had this experience before at Ryerson. Back when i was in grade 12 I was dating this girl who went to Ryerson. She had a Twin sister, and for the love of me I could not tell them apart. I remember seeing her sister (from the back) and i grabbed her and even when i saw her face I still didn't know and i talked to her for a good 30 mins before her sister make a coughing sound and turned my face red.

This situation is slightly differnt, for you see I DON'T KNOW THE GIRL. I have seen her 4 times and all four times scared the crap outta her. The last time after i scared i asked if she was my friend and she said NO!...I quickly made an exit trying to avoid a restraining order.

I also met up with my friend today(Finally) and watched some Arrested Development (Analysist and Therapist = ANALRAPIST?)and will prolly make that a wensday habit..maybe learn to cook i don't know haha. 

All the excitment aside, things are where they should be I will hopefully get a new job, since Staples is for Sucks."

Mean so little to so many
Why does she mean everything to me?

Is it worth the pain, with no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Questioning her good intention
Jealousy's a bad invention
When you push on glass, it's bound to break

Even when she was defensive,
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

I never walked so far on a lonely street
With no-one there for me
Is it worth the pain, with no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Accept this confession! ...I'm walking on pins and needles
You're not my possession! ...I'm walking on pins and needles
My conscience is vicious! ...I'm walking on pins and needles
And I'm begging forgiveness! ...I'm walking on pins and needles

I never walked so far on a lonely street,
With no one there for me

Old Godzilla was hopping around
Tokyo City like a big playground
when suddenly Batman burst from the shade
and hit Godzilla with a Batgrenade
Godzilla got pissed and began to attack
but didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq
who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq Fu
when Aaron Carter came out of the blue

and he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal
then they both got flattened by the Batmobile
but before it could make it back to the Batcave
Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave
and took an AK47 out from under his hat
and blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat
but he ran out of bullets and he ran away
because Optimus Prime came to save the day

this is the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny
good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see
and only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
this is the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny

Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime
like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime
and then Shaq came back covered in a tire track
but Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back
and Batman was injured, and trying to get steady
when Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete
but suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped
Indiana Jones took him out with his whip

then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind
and he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find
'cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed
and Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist
then he jumped in the air and did a summersault
while Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault
onto Optimus Prime, but they collided in the air
then they both got hit by a Care Bear Stare, oooh

this is the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny
good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see
and only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
this is the Ultimate Showdown...

angels sang out in immaculate chorus
down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris
who deliver a kick which could shatter bones
into the crotch of Indiana Jones
who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain
as Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne
but Chuck saw through his clever disguise
and he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs

then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White and
""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""'s Black Knight and
Benito Mussolini and The Blue Meanie and
Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie
Robocop, the Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader
Lo Pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger
Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan,
Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan
all came out of no where lightning fast
and they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass
it was the bloodiest battle the world ever saw
with civilians looking on total awe

and the fight raged on for a century
many lives were claimed, but eventually
the champion stood, the rest saw their better:
Mr. Rogers in a bloodstained sweater

this is the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny
good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see
and only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
this is the Ultimate Showdown...

It was the most real dream i've had in a long time. I really thought it was real at the time. It was basically my future wife and myself walking into a house and decideding if we wanted to live there. The house was a mix of all my relatives, with  6 bed rooms on the 3rd floor and a living room and a kicthcen. Its almost impossible to say it in words...but the whole time we talked about our future, what kids we'd have the space we need for all our stuff..ect. we chated with my uncle who is a great MC and is a proffesional engineer ( maybe i respect him too much?) and he welcomed us and gave us all this advice.

it was..amazing. The girl i was with was not who i'd thought i'd be...it was the girl of my dreams. Ironically i felt nothing wrong with her and it was as though we had been together for a long time with no end or problems in site. 

it was really moving....indeed."

I hadn't seen them in about a year and it was tearing my up. Well i finally spent some time with them. Simon is so huge! Even tho he's only 12 i keep thinking he's 15... and Jennie I didn't get to speak much to, as she spent most of her time in her room with her boyfriend. I did talk alot to Connie however. As Connie is perhaps the closest out of all of them to me, if one were to ask which was closest and if it's possible to even dishtinguish that, we went with her family-friend who is residing there to get a movie, where i met another carter person at block-buster..we stared at each other, say ""i know you..and hi"" and that it...as thought it was too weird on halloween night. We ended up renting candyman...which turned out to be really shitty. I laughed my ass off and connie tried to scream 10 mins after a scary scene, trying to scare us..but it was useless. the movie should have been given a pg rating, besides the nudity an R rating was uncalled for (who hasn't seen frontal nudity?) as everyone was kinda dissapointed at the crapohcity of this movie. Connie dropped me home afterwards and we talked for at least 30 mins in the car about everything...turns out we all have mis-perceptions about everything. Besides that Ms.Lam or Grace (i have a hard time deciding what to call her..maybe just mom? haha... totally loves me and everyone invited me to their family dinner tommorow for Simon's birthday. If you don't know...our families are so close that i was made Simon's god brother. The question is what do i get him...hard to imagine i've been friends with them before simon was born..a good 13 or 14 years now. Anyways i'm just happy to be back with my best friends.

I don't know what to do
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, She loves me not
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, she loves me

He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, She loves me not
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me...
No where to turn,
No one to help,
It's almost like I don't even know myself
Now I have to choose
I don't know what to do
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, She loves me not
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, She loves me not
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, She loves me not
He loves me, He loves me not
She loves me, She loves me not
Loves me not..."

"event","last public entry...fitting way to end public journals

the last needle cut

the fattest cat hid in your box.
shunken like a willow tree.
you pull the thread for your shoes.
the time is nearing, thinking of me.

you hold anger in your hand
closing tighly when someone stirs
lashing out at your one true fan
and then vision starts to blur.

you pull the needle from the thread
to keep from screaming what as your mind races
and plunge your face into you bed
as the blood covers both our faces

in those moments you spirit flares out
in those moments you spirit bleeds away
in those moments angry fades into pain
in those moments i no longer exist

but tommrow the thoughts come back
and you again try and hide it from me
but you know that dreadful fact
that your heart can no longer pay my fee

love for your flows down the drain
like the rain thats pouring off the roof
and you can only relate to the pain
by stabbing me in my hoof

the rain has stopped and my heart is pounding
two years have gone and i see the change
your face has darkened on a new founding
that i'm your new phasge

so i ask but with no response

did i make your life better or worse.
have we stopped talking, because of this chill.
did you help me, or cast your usual curse.
i'll never know. your so quiet. your abuse kill.

i see your last cut is an ""A""

"event","I'm so lost these last weeks....so many private posts...i feel like i should just end this journal. Speaking to haidee, i realized i made it so i could remember the things that were important to me, but now those things are gone away...and my memory is fading like air in my lungs. i'm so down...this is such a huge im-pass in my life. I stare at old journals and pictures and wonder, will any of this matter in the future? will this journal remind me of who i am, or who i wanted to be, or contain lost dreams.

I suppose this happends to me everytime...but it's so much better this time, because I have people i can talk to...well thats a lie...there is only 3 people and when i needed them only 1 was there...the 1 that if i couldn't talk to i'd just shut down.

I just...i don't know, feel so old. maybe its that all my friends have shifted...back to the university who were people i knew in my elementary school....all my highschool friends are gone...all my ex-girlfriends' friends are disappearing...and my ex-girlfriend is about to go to prom...about to graduate..and about to leave my life for along time...and i know i'll never see her again. this transfer is taking too much of a toll on my antiquated mind.

I guess i'm trying to tell everyone thanks for everything, in case i never set my eyes or ears on you again. now i'm all teary...what a toll on me...i just care too much about everyone...already, i have no reason to go to carter and i'm sure my invitations to my ex-girlfriend's friends parties are already expired. i really hate change of this magnitude. i want to think i'll be able to call up anyone and chat or that i'll see you all again..but as their prom approches i realize its all over. its not even my prom, but i always thought i'd be there. i guess i'm tried of trying, always me calling, e-mailing, mailing, visiting, and never having it returned. i used to think that it was because people were too busy or that they aren't as attached as i get to people. but its all too much now, my soul is filled with regret and i feel old. is this what i want to keep my journals? to remember that in the end, everyone left and i'm alone, despite what people said and despite what people do. 

my dad was right...he's always right, we born alone and we'll die alone and our life is lived alone with illusions of connections.

i just never thought it would end...

people will forget..but my dreams will remember the haunting times.

if i asked ""where are we"" two years ago when this all started, i would have said we're all the beginning of a great journey.

now i would say ""i missed the journey and everyone i ever cared about are soaring away""

my first journal i wrote: 

""I watch a re-run of smallville today. Sometimes I want to be Clark Kent so badly I can taste. I know it's just a TV show, but to me it's like my dream""
""Claramae - She averages 90  in science and math. She's exactly what I want to be, she living my dream, and I sometimes think she'll get into university before me.""

i'll never forget when she said ""your my clark kent""

my last journal, if this is it..smallville it's self is ending as clark kent is graduating...ironic how it mirrors my life. maybe i don't want to be clark, i just wish i could live in the ideals he trys to uphold. and Claramae..everything i thought about her came true and she's gone so far ahead of me, it's really a testament to my stupidity that i show in my life...if only i could redo highschool...alas the dreams of millions.

I guess i'm just waiting for her to say...""i don't care a bit anymore"".

So where am i going from here? I guess i'm going to life a middle income life and a quiet life where only my family will remember me when i die...and then fade into history as a statistical number...i sometimes sit up all night and think about how i wish i had done something...because in the end i'll just be dust, and none of this will even matter to anyone...maybe it's because i surround myself with the best and brightest, before they are known that i feel so bad...i was great before they realized thier potential and now...they are gone...exceeding everything i am and i just can't follow in that path they leave.

I want to write so much more...leave it so that it's not forgotten...i'm not forgotten in the rubble that everyone will bury me in..

This is a fitting song to end it all..so thought-provoking...

Claramae if you read this...please never throw out my poetry and letters...

i guess in the end no one remembers...not one bit."

I was talking the Mer, who is going throught the same type of problem. Her ex and her decided after months of trying to be friends, to just stop talking. Apparently their conversation just went back to the relationship and Mer says she can't help the way she feels, but he's too tired to put up with it and ended the friendship. Heading that way, I'm planning to end everything sometimes in July, maybe...I Wish I could just act normal. WHY CANT I ACT NORMAL!! WHY DOES GOD CURSE ME WITH FEELINGS I DON""T WANT. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS GOD LIFE. WHY DO I HAVE TO WEIRD HER OUT! FUCK! SOMEONE PUNCH ME IN THE HEAD. I SWEAR I'D WALK INTO TRAFFIC IF THE BRAIN INJURY WOULD MAKE ME FEEL NOTHING AND REMEMBER NOTHING.

I MEAN I WAS A GREAT BOY FRIEND....WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE TO SCREW IT UP AFTER THE BREAK UP....I DONT UNDERSTAND IT, WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER THAT MAKES ME WANT TO TALK TO HER. I SWEAR TO GOD I'M NEVER DATING AGAIN. I HATE THIS NIGHT, I HATE THIS GOD DAM LIFE AND GOD DAM FEELINGS. OMG I'M PISSED AND THE FUCKING SONG WONT SHUT UP. ALL I WANT TO BE IS A COOL FRIEND, BUT EVERYTHING ALWAYS COMES BACK TO HER. SHE'S DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK, HOW DOES SHE DO IT,HOW!!!!!!!!!!OMFG HOW DOES SHE JUST PUT IT ALL BEHIND HER AND FUNCTION. WHEN WE HANG OUT SHE'S TOTALLY NORMAL, AND I'M TOTALLY AND ASS....I'M NOT TRYING TO BE ONE...IT JUST FUCKING HAPPENDS TO ME. I MEAN I SWEAR ILL STAB MY BRAIN IN A MINUTE. HOW DOES A PERSON LOSE A FEELING, SHE LOST IT, WHY THE FUCK CAN'T I!!! I'M ANGRY AT MYSELF...I THOUGHT I WAS THE RATIONAL AND EASY GOING UNDERSTOOD IT ALL GUY, WHOS NEVER IS INSULTED OR FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I JUST ACCEPT IT ALL...BUT I CAN'T FREAKING ACCEPT THIS I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO FRAKING HURT HER ANYMORE WTFAFWJLAFJLSKAFSJ'L'LJKAFSL'JKASFJKL'ASF'JKLASFL'KJASFL'KJASF'LDGSJKGDHK'HGKAAGHL'KFGFHL' OMGF IM HATE THIS HATE IT HATE IT.....AND SHE'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND...BUT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS GARBAGE....I'VE NEVER HAD THIS STUPID RELATIONSHIP WITH MY EX'S SO WHY HER..........ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Cindy broke up with her bf...im still trying to figure out some stuf around there, but a TXT msg? what a jerk...that's a really low...what an asshole.

Poker nights with jono,chris,fonz,nacci,mark,dignum and a few others is hella fun. Even tho im in the hole 13$ its nice to be around the old carter crew. Playing poker is fun too... even if jono rapes us all haha.

I went to see sin city...really good movie.

Conversation
Alan: That girl is hot!
Cindy: Oh I know it
Thomas: Its her boobs they are so good
Alan: It's not even her boobs
Cindy: You love her for the short hair
Alan: Dam you know it!

Then I've driven about 500km from poker, to movies to parties...fun week

I had an interview with for the GIST...didn't go so well :(

Today, I went to see Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy.
So I head down to carter...and find Claramae gone home!!! omg? (i went to see sin city with her friends, so i owed another movie to her) anyways, we had to reschdual our 4:45 show because we (mike and steve + me) went all the way to the danforth and picked her up! I took 1 hour to get there...tons of traffic. When i get there, I pulled in and her dad is like...nice car (thinks:""I hate this guy!"") and i'm like...it works. So she gets in and her mom comes out and asks "" Do I trust you driving?"" To which I respond "" I got here safely didn't I?"" ...eek? anyways they don't trust me driving. While it took 1 hour to get there, it only too 15 mins to get back because, as we suspected Claramae has excellent directional sensability. We arrived at the movie around 6:50, and meet up with Alvin. Petri arrives late but still in time for the movie. 

What a movie...I was laughing for almost 3/4 of it. The funniest darn movie i've seen in awhile. It was pretty good in plot too. We were all amazed at how good it was. Dolphins thank us for the fish and fly into space...too funny.

After that I drove claramae home and we talked about how its not usual to stay friends like this and her parents are worried that i'll hurt her...you know you cant win in this world so I stopped trying. Oh well I think we're pretty good friends anyways.

So then, Mike, steve, alvin and brother head to KO BBQ...for buffet style dinner at  midnight. It was pretty good lots of food and some fun times cooking. After that steve and Mike setup the lan party and we were suppoed to party, but forgot the router, so we just watched movies and startrek haha...steve was so lost he's like what year is this? haha.

Anyways they all sleeping now and I should sleep too."

Oh well I'll write the song and give it too her, she fades from my meaning...anyways i had a weird dream about some carter people. It was like a resort and what ever and one of my friends was sunbathing nude...I know her and its so messed up, cuz shes so nice...Dreams are so weird

So I was playing with jono, fonz and sister some poker and I lost (10$)...jono raped us all and it was alot of fun...i'm so tired sorry if my writing is fragmented. We also used a lazer pointer to make the cat nuts but I erased it omfg..so mad about that.

It started at 9am when i reliazed i missed the bus. haha...i got on the 11:30 bus and go into Toronto at around 1:30...I got my hair cut around 1:50. I was supposed to meet Claramae at 2:00 for the Jam, but as usual I didn't get around to her house on time. She even told me "" I expected you to arrive at 2:30-3:00 which is why i said come around 2:00 pm""...haha she knows me too well. So we met up at main street station. On the way to meet her tho I meet Owen!! we briefly talk about how the prohaska sister are rapists and how paul was lucky to escape lol. So I met Claramae at the station and gave her some cini-stix...my solution to every time im late haha. We then went to queen station and walked from eatons centre to the faculty of music. I believe it too 40 mins to get there as I had no idea where it was, but i was confident I could figure it out. Oddly enough it worked and we found the place without hassle. On the way we saw and elvis impersonator and Claramae smoked her lungs out (actually just 1 benson haha). We teased each other all the way there, it was so much fun. I could have left satisfied with the walk alone. So we got to the Faculty of Music for UofT and we made it to the 3rd floor where we met, Tristan, Mel, Winnie, Mr. Bellisimo and wife and mr. Arbhor! Tristans preformance was spectacular..he's skill really impressed, even if he did make 2-3 mistakes only I knew...(and the audience). At the intermission, Claramae had to go to the washroom so I took her to the 2nd floor. While i wait I read a ""Stalking is against the Law"" poster. I found out that looking at pets is stalking...what??? anyways we got back and tristan be-dazzeled us all in his genius. Unfortunately we had to leave to get to Lisa's fashion show. We skipped across Toronto to get to Ryerson. On the way we had a serious discussion about who we really are and what type of person are we...pretty dam cool. So we got to Ryerson and the were a massive line. But we got out tickets and got in. Because of Krissettes's and Marelle's behavior towards my attendance of this event, I didn't bother to talk to them. they can kiss my brown ass. So Claramae and I got in on the right side and ti was a fantastic show. The guy's wear was totally awesome and the event was much better than last year. After the show we congradulated Lisa and headed to McDonalds in the Eatons centre. On the way we saw a live band at the EDGE 102 place. I took a photo of Claramae and the Band (in the distnace)..so i could edit her as the guitarist haha. At eatons centre I ordered a Big Mac Meal...more like a small dink meal. The hamburger was the size of Claramae's fist lol. She had a salad and we had yet another discussion about becoming an adult. after we were done, i walked her to the dundas subway tell her that if anything bad ever happended, i'd never her let her go home alone. But i'm all in for treating her like an adult so we hugged and parted..it was so good. then she came running back cuz she was on the wrong side and wouldn't J walk with me ahaha...made me wait on the other side. I got on the bus and fell asleep.

It was such a great day..exhaustive but I really felt at home. Looking forward to more stuff in the summer.

Here are 10 pictures out of the 90 I took...Sorry for the size, but its too late to edit them.

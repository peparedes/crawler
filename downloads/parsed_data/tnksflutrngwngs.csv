Ray is going to look into joining the army. Dad said that he thinks that they are taking GED's right now, and that if ray goes to school just so he can join the air force, he still may be too old to get in, because he is 2 months shy of 25 as it is.
being an army wife wouldnt be so bad, except that they are recruting people to be on the front lines in the middle east. I would always worry, but we'd be married before then, and happily stationed somewhere.
I hope that they are accepting GED's. he seems excited about it.

I was shot down by Geico today. That royally sucked.
I even applied at Monkey Joes {{which is an indoor inflatable playground}}.
Today I will be dropping off my applications at Belles &amp; Beaus and at Eagle Springs.
Hopefully one of them will hire me.

:::::EDIT:::::
Hahahahahahaha!!
I got a job at one of the gas stations.
They totally loved the way I presented myself yesterday when I came in to get an application, so the manager told her supervisor, and he said, &quot;well, tell her she's got the job.&quot;
YAY!!"

"event","So, how unfair is it that the day {{yesterday}} that I return to work after HAVING SURGERY , my boss suddenly decides to up and fire me? She said that I was, &quot;not following protocal&quot; because I didnt report a teacher for something, but I did, and my boss said that the teacher would never do something like that and that she didnt believe me. She also said that I wasnt carrying out my duties at work. 

 My favorite thing she said was, &quot;Do you even change diapers? I have never once seen you change a diaper!&quot; When just last week she complemented me on how quickly I can change a diaper, as if it was a skill or something.

 Then, she calls me tonight telling me that &quot;a parent approached&quot; her and said that they were upset that I was gone. She said that I had contacted them, which, duh, I did, because we are also friends, and that it was illegal for me to talk to &quot;her parents&quot;. Fuck that. I will talk to WHOEVER I want to. I am twenty years old and I have all of the same rights that she does.

 So, if the next time she calls, will I be out of line telling her that she can take it up with my lawyers? Because calling me AFTER she has fired me to bitch me out is basically harassment."

I hate that I feel like no one actually gives a crap about me. I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough for my parents.
I hate this.
Maybe I'm just being stupid, but I feel like all I do is go to work and come home to a dirty house that I have to clean, and then I get to listen to my dad say, &quot;Why doesnt anyone ever lift a Fucking finger to clean up this dump?!&quot;
EXCUSE ME??
I did YOUR dishes, and I vacuumed and cleaned the living room and bathroom. Not to mention cleaning my room and filling up the dogs water jug, and making sure that YOUR children get up and get ready for school.
I already have a job that requires me to be on my feet all day and requires me to vacuum and clean bathrooms and tables and sweep and mop, on top of changing diapers, wiping runny noses, dealing with biters and kids that hit and scream instead of using words.
Ugg.
I guess that I am just feeling unappreciated.

I am trying to show him how much I love him and how well I can take care of him, but he wants my mom.
I know that he really didnt have much of a mom growing up, but it really hurts my feelings.
Maybe its just because he doesnt ever get sick like this.

While I was cooking dinner, Ray moved the little table into the living room. He set it, and lit some candles, then he turned off the light when it was time to eat. He poured my drink and everything. It was wonderful.
After dinner, we watched Thr3e...which definitely wasnt as good as the book, but still ok.

She didnt look like she was exactly in the happiest mood. I was going to give her a hug and tell her hi, but before I even got the chance, a boy in our youth started to just let her have it.

Just a little refresher course before my test on Friday. God was truely looking out for me after that. Danah wanted me to fill in for her tonight, and I had my heart set on going to youth, but God had me in his hands. Ashley&nbsp;showed up to work when she wasnt scheduled,&nbsp;so I was able to go to&nbsp;youth. </p><p>Well, after the service, the devil decided to play with me. I went down to the nursery to apologize for not being there on Sunday night for the meeting {{I was throwing up like crazy}}. Well,&nbsp;my boss proceeded to lecture me on the ""importance&nbsp;of always being on time for meetings and always&nbsp;being at work when i'm scheduled"". Um, I've&nbsp;never missed a SINGLE day of work that I have not found a replacement for, and as for the meeting, well,&nbsp;excuse me for being sick. I stayed as nice as I could when I explained all this to&nbsp;my boss, but then she got mad at me b/c on Sunday morning I signed out at 12:30&nbsp;when I was done at 12:20.....I looked at my mom's watch to see the time,&nbsp;not knowing&nbsp;that it is 10 minutes ahead. I explained that to her as&nbsp;well, and changed the time on my card to say 12:20. She continued to lecture me some more after I asked her if I could have Easter Sunday off {{which she said I ABSOLUTELY could NOT...even though I was sick last year and missed the service}}, and then I finally said, ""My ride is waiting. I really have to go.""&nbsp;</p><p>Then I came home, and I was really upset, but I didnt show it, oh no. I'm not one to wear my emotions on my sleeve....I'm really not....I hate it when people say, ""whats wrong? why are you upset?"" b/c&nbsp;I hate explaining things, so&nbsp;I just dont show that I'm upset....but tonight, after Ray got up to let his dog out, his phone alarm went off. I turned it off and saw that a picture of his FUCKING DOG is his wallpaper. Do you know what my wallpaper is? Him. A picture of Ray is what I see everytime I use my phone. That way, he knows I think about him...but no....his wallpaper is his damn dog. I know that it really shouldnt bother me...its stupid and petty, and normally, something like that wouldnt, but his dog always comes first no matter what. Here is the order of importance {{as I see it}} in Ray's world. </p><p>1. Dog<br />2. Computer<br />3. My mom {{he talks to her about everything....and me....nothing}}<br />4. Me</p><p>Seriously....I feel like I am the least important thing in his life. I want to talk to him about it, but I know that he will just dismiss it or something.

We went to see The Covenant. It was pretty decent.
That Jenny girl pissed me off. She was being really rude to Ray and she was being a bitch at Coldstone.
Thank God she went home.
After the movie/coldstone, we went to John's house. 
I didnt know he lives down the street from me.
The boys played Halo and I talked to John's little sister.
She's pretty cool.
Ray said that I seemed different last night. Like I had something on my mind.

"event","<p>as i go through and read blogs and as i sit and listen to my friends tell me thier ""problems"" i find myself wondering why they are bitching and why i am sitting there letting them.</p>
<p>think about it. if you have parents who are willing to feed and cloth you,&nbsp;make you&nbsp;go&nbsp;to school, let you hang out with your friends,&nbsp;and raise you with care, shouldnt that be enough to prove that they love you? why do we feel the need to have our parents prove their love by giving us all their money, buying us only the ""best"" clothes, letting us walk all over them, and then basically letting us spit in thier faces? </p>
<p>take my sister for instance. she is pissed because my parents dont like her boyfriend. they are saying that she has changed since they started dating. it has <strong><font color=""#993366"">NOTHING</font></strong> to do with the fact that he isnt a Christian, and everything to do with the fact that since they have started dating, she has been selfish, rude, uncooperative, mean, ditching her friends, ditching me, standoffish,&nbsp;etc. she doesnt see it. she lets her boyfriend walk all over her, and&nbsp;she lets him&nbsp;make fun of my&nbsp;brothers. he picks on my brother with&nbsp;mental disabilities more than anything and&nbsp;she just sits&nbsp;there and lets it&nbsp;happen. she, of course, does not see it that way, but&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;else does, even her best friend.</p>
<p>mom and dad are trying to look out for her. they dont want her getting hurt later on by this stuff. but she doesnt care. she just wants them there to take her over to ""his"" house, buy her clothes, pay for&nbsp;the crap she wants to buy at the mall, and then leave her the&nbsp;hell alone. </p>
<p>it shouldnt work that way.</p>
<p>you know, i used to think that my dad&nbsp;was the source&nbsp;of all my&nbsp;problems. i used to think that he was the reason that i was cutting myself, because everytime i cut myself&nbsp;<strong><font color=""#3366ff"">REALLY</font></strong> badly, it was after a fight i had with him. i used to blame him for everything. i have very resently realized that my problems were not my dad's fault, they were mine. well, actually, they were the mental illness....but thats another blog entirely. </p>
<p>anyway, one night, about&nbsp;6 months into my senior year,&nbsp;after i had cut&nbsp;my foot to, basically, hamburger meat, i looked&nbsp;at myself in&nbsp;my bedroom mirror. i was contemplating what my next move was going to be. more cutting? suicide?&nbsp;i saw the mascara running down my face and the&nbsp;blood soaking through the ace bandage. i saw the razor in my hand and the fear in my eyes. for the first time since the 7th grade (that is when i began to cut), i could feel the pain that the razor had caused. the physical pain of the gashes on my foot. i knew that i had to stop, that cutting or suicide were not going to help me at all,&nbsp;so i took the razor, broke it in half, and threw it in the trash. </p>
<p>i looked at myself again, and told myself that the problem wasnt with my dad, it was with me. dad had been my scapegoat since the 7th grade, and he didnt deserve that. i didnt deserve that kind of pain either, so i made it my life goal to never get myself down to that point ever again. things are slowly becoming better.</p>
<p>so, i guess that what i am trying to say is, dont get pissed off if your parents want to know where you are and who you are with. dont get mad if you cant go to Holister or American Eagle to buy a $35 dollar shirt. your parents are trying. most of them want the best for their children,&nbsp;but sometimes the best comes with a budget. sometimes the best is a shopping spree at TJ Maxx and&nbsp;$20 to go&nbsp;to the movies. your parents love you and they are trying, so give them a break&nbsp;every now and then. a hug and saying, ""i love you mom. thanks for everything."" might be&nbsp;just what the doctor ordered.&nbsp;</p>

<p align=""center"">Here's what we did...</p>
<p align=""center"">We went to Gulfport to help Katrina victims rebuild their houses. We were put in groups (not by church) and we worked on a house for 5 days.</p>
<p align=""center"">I had so much fun with my <strong>WONDERFUL</strong> group (Wanda, Richard, Jake, Emily, Kara, Kristen, Braden, Patrick, Lyndsey, and Daniel) I love those guys so much <img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/artistic.gif"" /></p>
<p align=""center"">On our way to Gulfport we passed by the Mississippi sign and saw Kara's church standing in front of it. We pretty much thought that they were insane...espacially since it was about to pour down rain.</p>
<p align=""center"">We had worship that night and we also found out there was <strong>NO </strong>hot water, and 12 showers (8 being communial, however you spell that). The next day we had pictures and went to our worksite. We were told we might not have anyone from our church group in our group...which happened, but thats ok, because i had Kara.&nbsp;The lady that we were rebuilding the house for was a <strong>VERY GODLY </strong>woman, her name was Miss Annie, I <strong>LOVE </strong>her to death.</p>
<p align=""center"">We had the same schedule about everyday exept Wedsday, we got group free time, that was fun. Our youth group went to Covington, Louisiana (which was 2 hours away) and ate at this <strong>AMAZING </strong>seafood place. Seeing as how I dont like seafood, I got a turkey club. It was yummy. The we went to Wal-Mart and bought some food for the room.</p>
<p align=""center"">Thursday we got Miss Annie something and got pictures developed and had the same old same old. I failed to tell about the nasty peanut butter and jelly sandwitchs from wendsday <strong>YUCK </strong>...our group got double cheesebugers instead. <img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/artistic.gif"" />&nbsp;</p>
<p align=""center"">Friday was amazing but yet sad <img alt="""" src=""http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/apathetic.gif"" />&nbsp;it was our last day. Miss Annie took us out to Pizza Hut to eat. By that time our goup was really close. We stopped by a yard sale and met a lady named Brenda who was very sweet and kind she showed us where she lived and stuff, she had her FEMA trailer fixed up. We then went to Dollar Genral and a trift store, and we went to the Armory....where the NC&nbsp;Baptist men were staying. &nbsp;Miss Annie gave us a tile off her floor with a message to each of us and a thank you card. She cried as we pulled off, and I cried after I got back to the school.&nbsp;Inside the thank you card she put $10. We were there to help her, so&nbsp;why did she do that. Out of <strong>LOVE </strong>thats what I think, but she still did not have to do that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Friday night, AJ, Brodo, Terry, Carrie, Kathryn D., and I went to the beach. it was soooooooo sad. there were clothes and stuff imbedded in the water. As Kathryn and I were walking in the sand, i saw this blue thing. I dug it up, and it was a little plastic carebear cup. I can't even imagine what happened to the little girl that had owned that cup.</p>
<p align=""center"">Thats about it. We picked on AJ a bit...and none of the people that went with our group likes Kathryn D. very much. She's extremely irritating. But we had a really good time...and I would do it again in a Heartbeat.</p>

friday night abby and i planned on going to see Just My Luck, but it started to hail, so we went to abby's house instead to wait out the storm. well, we watched Garden State, which was fantastic, and then when the storm was done, we went to Sonic. we played a lame-ass cd that we love. lol. i will never admit what it was. 

Abby fell on her ass. that was funny.

saturday, abby came and picked me up at 1 pm. we went to see Just My Luck, which was really really cute...but longer that it should have been. after that we went to taco bell. there was this rude lady there that i wanted to slap. she kept saying, ""Where's my Guacamole?!? How can you NOT have Guacamole?!? You should have TOLD me that YOU dont serve Guacamole!!!"" the poor workers looked scared. i was gonna say something, but the woman scared me. i said to abby, ""She never ASKED for guacamole. What a bitch."" i think the woman heard me. oh well. after taco bell, we went to the dollar theater to see United 93. that was a sad movie. i kept leaving because i didnt want to cry. some guy hit on me. he said, ""You know, some girls know how to float, and others sort of just sink...and you, YOU know how to float."" i was like, ""uh, thanks."" and i walked off. he was some random black guy. lol.

after the movie, we went to javabytes and we saw zach. that boy has lost some SERIOUS weight. after that, i came home.

mom, justin, and i went to Applebee's, my treat. 

then, at church last night we had to dress up in western clothes and we had a bbq after church. after that kayla, maddie and i went to coldstone creamery, that new ice cream place that david works at. i tipped them, so they had to sing for me. it was fun.

"event","i have to say that i am pretty upset right now.

pissed...to be quite honest.

you see...i had these plans with someone for sunday, the 21st. well, those plans were abruptly cancelled for no reason that anyone bothered to tell me about. the person i had these plans with said that they would have to reschedule and that it would be within the next 2 weeks. well, today i find out that this person and wynna have plans for this thursday. 

uh...WHAT HAPPENED TO LUNCH?!?

i dont like being kicked to the curb without so much as a FREAKING explaination.

where is my explaination?

it wouldnt bug me if these plans with wynna had been made before the original plans of mine and this other person, but they werent. 

i cant help but feel as if my friendship isnt good enough. i feel like i am being replaced by wynna, who hasnt even known this other person a full year yet.

i guess i'm just not all that important...and i mean that. its not ""melissa being emo"", its melissa being honest.

</3 melissa"

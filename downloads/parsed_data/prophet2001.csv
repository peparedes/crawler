When I saw 'The Village' on its opening weekend, I walked out...pissed off.  Since then I've been asking myself just why it was such a terrible movie.  I've stayed up for hours at night thinking of the answer to this question.  Not because I couldnt find one, but because there were so many reasons.

Here's the Village in a few easy steps.  Yes, it will spoil the movie, so if you want to see it, dont read it

Step 1: 'Holy shit!  Don't go into the forest or these things will kill you!'
Step 2: 'Hi, I'm Joaquin Phoenix, I am rebelious and inquisitive, I also love this blind chick.'
Step 3: (Enter 'scary bullshit) 'Holy crap!  did you see that?  That was lame, but none the less we're scared shitless. (Enter long, boring love interest story line -Yawn-)
Step 4: 'Hi, I'm the Village retard, I love the blind chick too and when Joaquin and her get engaged, I stab Joaquin a bunch.'
Step 5: 'Holy Crap!  The retard stabbed him!  Lock him up!  The doctor cant fix him, so lets send the blind chick into the forest to the next town and find medicine.'
Step 6: 'Hi, we're the elders.  We Lied to you all your entire lives!!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  We're the monsters!!!!  Blind chick: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.'
Step 7: 'Well, I'm fucking blind and walking in the forest.  Holy crap!  Its one of the beasts!  But I know they're fake, so what the fuck is going on?  Oh well, I'll lead it into this big ass pit and kill it.'
Step 8: 'Hey!  The room we locked the retard in had a beast costume hidden inside it.  Fucking oops!'
Step 9: 'Hi!  I'm a security guard for a Natural Habitat Perserve.  What the hell is this chick doing climbing over the fence?  Wait, she's kinda hot, so I'll drive her back to the guard shack and see my boss M. Night Shyamalan, maybe he'll know what to do.'
Step 10: 'Hi, I'm M. Night Shyamalan, shamelessly plugging myself into another of my movies, kinda like Steven King does, but I'm better because my movies suck worse.  (all while he jacks off to pictures of King).  I'll pretend not to notice my guard stealing medical supplies and  bitch about the 'hard times' I've had while working here.'
Step 11: 'Well, I'm back from the other town with Medicine.  Hurray!  Joaquin's saved.'
Step 12: 'Hi, we're the Village elders again.  We were all a bunch of people who met in a therapy group and this fuck up of a leader convinced us this was all a good idea.  Anit that a bitch?'

The end.  It's amazing, I could have read that on the movie screen and walked out a thousand times more pleased with the movie then I was.  THe movie is about 30 minutes long, with about a hour and a half of meaningless, boring crap that we all figured out in the first 10 minutes of the movie.  Hurray for the village, best movie I've seen since 'I am Sam'.  Seriously though, all these critics are saying its the best movie of the summer.  And it would have been too, had the summer been filled with equally boring and shitty movies, but it wasnt.  We have Spiderman 2, Hero, hell even AvP looks mildly more entertaining then the village.  I also love how they say its a thriller and scary as hell.  Well, it is scary...for about 5 minutes, and it is thrilling, I know I was thrilled when it was over.  Its not scary, or thrilling, its just dog shit.  He goes from making great movies like the 6th sense to...this.  Sad.  What?  It's sad that he's making movies this crappy now?  No, IM sad cuz I wasted good money and time on the movie.
The Village is just like its title, dull and uninteresting.  M. Night Shyamalan would have done a lot better cutting 90% of the movie out and making it a short flim and plugging it into Sundance or something, because this was 2 hours of pain sitting in a uncomfortable movie chair with boring shit on the screen.
-Yawn-"

"event","Alright, this Atkin's diet has gone to far...seriously.

'Its a miracle diet!'  'I lost 300 pounds on the Atkin's diet'

Yeah well I gained a net 0 pounds by not following the Atkins diet.  When Beer companies start advertising their new low carb beers, shit has gone to far.  Everyone's running around eatting all this low carb shit, all jsut to lose weight.  The Atkin's diet is nothing new, hell, its about as old as I am, so why the sudden realization of it?  But lets get down to business folks.  
Does the Atkin's diet work?  yes.  there's no question that it works, however there are some flaws to it.  so, just what are carbs?  you know when you walk?  you're using carbs.  You know when you pick up that low carb shit you're ingesting?  you're using carbs.  Carbohydrates fuel your body, did you know that?  While its true that excess carbs in your body does turn to fat, the conversion between carbs and fat is minimal.  
I understand if you want to lose weight, but there are easier, better yet ways that far more improve your health.  Here's a tip.  When you're going to McDonalds, turn your car around and go somewhere else.  Why?  FATTY FOODS dumbass!  Get a goddamn clue.  If some food is low on Carbs, is it low on fat?  generally, yes, but not always.  You want to lose wieght?  fine, eat healthy, eat carbs, WORK THE FUCK OUT!  walk 10 blocks each day (note walk, not run.  Running damages your lungs, knees, etc.).  Go to a damn gym 3 times a week for a hour.  There is no call for eatting strictly low carb stuff.  Hell, while you're working out, eat fatty foods, so long as your base diet includes a vast majority of low fat and saturated fat, you'll shed those pounds like a cat sheds in summer. 
PUT DOWN THE FORK!
its really that damn simple.

Low carb beer?  HA!  98% of the people who are at a bar dont think to themselves as they're ordering: 'Oh shit!  does that beer have 20 or 5 carbs in it?'

Gimmie a goddamn break."

"event","Few things which have crossed the line: 'The Truth'


first on the list is the 'Truth'.  What I mean by truth is the anti-smoking crap shamelessly thrown about on TV, Radio, billboards, movie commercials before the previews, bus signs, and many other forms of mass media.  Within these truth advertisments, you'll find an astonishing fact: Smoking, is indeed, bad for your health.  I'll give you a moment to react in shock...
...
...
alright, enough time has passed.  I was dumbfounded to find out this absolutly scientific revolution.  

Alright, time to get serious folks, EVERYONE and their mothers KNOW smoking is bad for you, guess what?  we are either addicted, or dont care, or both.  As a smoker, I know these things are killing me, guess what?  Im one of those who dont really care.  The only reason I would want to quit smoking would be to save money.  As for the health risks, guess what?  Cigarettes arent taking years off my life RIGHT NOW, they're taking years off the END of my life.  You know, the end part where you become more or less feeble, useless, and a drag on society?  Oh!  Poor me!  Im not going to die old and crapping my pants like everyone else will.  Besides that, in todays world, what with terrorism, rising gun killings, the odds of living to a ripe old age are slowly declining, so smoke up while you can.
To make matters worse, this world is slowly becomming anti-smoker oriented, what with entire counties passing laws saying that we're not allowed to smoke in public areas like bars, restaurants, etc.  One day, I'll quit smoking, that or I'll die.  Oh well."

"event","so, the other day, I endded up seein a few people I havnt seen in a month and a half, more or less.
Not at all surprising, my old circle of friends hasnt changed much, with the exception of maybe 1 or two of them.  It was all fun and games, making fun of Evan while he had to 'mow his yard'  
But back to the point of this, I found out, on my way home, some rather interesting news.  In no way was the enlightenment unsurprising.  I found out that one of my friends slept with a guy that her supposed 'best friend' was going after.  It caused no shock to me, as I figured it was bound to happen, given what I know of these people, but the fact remains, it speaks a lot about the little theif's personality.  It would seem that my month(s) of not speaking or seeing her were well worth it, as I wouldn't have wanted to even been near by when all this occured, after all Melrose Place was a shitty TV series, to be in it in real life would be a nightmare.  
It really makes me shake my head in disgust, what happened.  Hope they enjoy life in the lowest possible position as any sort of friend.
Pfft."

"event","It was late at night, and I was desperatly flipping through the channels on TV when I happened of the biggest scam, but also the best idea ever.
on QVC, there was 20 silver dollars on sale.  Now, I stopped and thought about this for a moment, how can you sell money?
Then I looked at the price they wanted...$1150
Now, I looked into the matter, thinking that maybe these Silver dollars were pure silver, but even then it wouldn't warrent a thousand dollar price tag.  As it was, the silver dollars were just that, silver dollars.  Nothing special, not pure silver.  just some old coins.
Shit, I go steal $20 and run down to the post office and get 20 silver dollars and then in turn sell them for $1000
Now, I know these people are going after coin collectors.  But the very idea of collecting coins confuses me.  What is the point of paying hundreds of dollars for a coin, which if I take to 7-11 is going to be worth its original mint value?

Best scam ever, but also a great idea to pawn to suckers who collect coins."

If your at all interested to see where this came from, check the comments from <b><i>Irony's a Bitch</b></i> An article below.
Its these kinds of things which make me weep for humanity, honestly.  Have we gotten so lazy that now pushing 'k' and 'w' is too much work?  Well, perhaps if your mentally challeneged, much like the person who made the original comment, it is indeed too much work.

Now, lets think for a moment.  Now, 90% of the population on this planet wants to sound reasonably intelligent when they write.  So making a comment on someone's random livejournal using things such as 'lol', 'no' (when meaning know) 'lmao', 'omg' (or omfg), and so on.

"event","Not 5 seconds having finished my last post, I turned on the TV and on Fox tonight was 'Test The Nation'
This idea tops those shitty, SHITTY reality TV shows.
What were network executives thinking with this crock of shit? 'I know!  Lets gather groups of people, and have a crapp IQ test and then, sell the idea that everyone in the entire country can play along with, only to remind them of how retarded and ignorant they are!  BRILLIANT!!!!'

What they were really thinking:  Network executives(a bunch of KKK, Men with egos larger then the galaxy): 'Lets make a show to put down all women, red necks, African Americans.  And in doing so, lets inflate the egos (and wallets) of Celeberties and doctors!  We'll call it...an IQ test when its really a way of making us feel better about ourselves and proving how much better we are then minorities or women.'

Holy shit.  To make matters worse, apparently this same show was aired last year too.

Look, What difference does it make, our IQ?  Let me tell you, NONE.  ZERO.  NOTHING.  NOT A DAMN THING.  Why?  Complicated question, only rivaled by its answer.


For starters, how about the fact that 90% of the world is run of common sense?  Does that grab you by the testicles?  We could be a country with every man, woman, and child with an IQ of 130 or greater, which would put you in MENSA or whatever the fuck it's called.  Now, one would venture that the smarter the people in the country, the better it would be.  Thats what you'd think.  Sadly, you're wrong.  See, for all the intelegent people in our country, we're still fuck ups.  'Oh wow!  Look at us!  We have an IQ of 130, yet we're still going around wasting resources and bombing you!  Aren't we so goddamn special?'  Right, the world is going to respect us because of our IQs despite the fact that we're blowing their shit up and taking their resources.  Our president couldnt score 10 on an IQ test, yet by some act of god, republicans were born and hundreds of years later then voted him into office because he was rich.  Bush is a tard, no way around it.  But did his IQ make him a tard, or did his years of drug and alcohol abuse do that?  
Its simple, IQs dont make quality of character any better, they only make things worse.  People with larger IQs tend to think they're better then everyone else, yet when I punch them in the face, they crumple up like everyone else.  IQs dont mean dick if you can't be a human being with it.
Who could possibly give a shit about IQ is your a shitty person?  Hell, I could be the smartest guy in the planet, an IQ so high, it touches the moon, but I could be an absolute prick and be hated.  Not that I'm not a prick, but my IQ doesnt reach the moon...quite.
IQs are just another way of classifying people by race and gender.  Hell, look at the groups of people there; Blonde chicks, Garbage people, Unemployed, Teachers/professors/, Students,Doctors, and 6 celeberties.  Instantly when the camera panned to the Garbage folk, I noticed they're all black, except for maybe 1 or 2 white guys.  Then, the blonde women...wait a second, I'm seeing Racism AND sexism all in the same show!!!  Damn.  Even I'm not that racist or sexist in public.
Then, more joy follows.  They're going to broadcast the scores of each group!  Only further pushing the constant racsim/sexism projected by their broadcast.  Are women smarter then men?  Who cares?  Its only yet another way of giving women activists another reason to protest out male dominated society.  Are white people(the doctor group on the show) Smarter then black people(the garbage people on the show)?  Who cares.  It only gives civil rights movemtns more reason to bitch about being oppressed.
This show promotes racism and sexism and adds fuel to fires which shouldn't exist in the first place.  IQs in general do NOTHING except make people feel smug about their brain or piss poor and hopeless.
The Unemployed group is particularly offending to me, being as I am unemployed.  Putting them on this IQ test is like saying: 'Lets see if you're to stupid to get a job!'  
-sigh-
'So Dan, if you've got so much to say, what's your IQ?'  I'll tell you.  My IQ is exactly...None of your damn business.  I havn't taken an IQ test in about 5 years, and even then, my IQ wouldn't change who I am, what I am, or anything else.  The only thing it would do is give me a reason to laugh at everyone who scored lower then I did on a test which was made by some guy who think's he's a fucking genius because he took a test on a good day.
Fuck you for even asking what my IQ is.  Must you be so shallow that you judge me based on my IQ and not the quality or content of my character.  Keeping in mind that character plays a role in EVERYDAY activities and interactions where as IQ plays a part in...well...nothing.
Tests of this nature (meaning all tests period except for drug tests and the like) only show one thing.  You're good at taking tests.  Hell, I remember once I took a test in history after having a shitty day.  I failed.  I was told I could make it up, which I glady did on a better day.  I hadn't studied at all, infact I had damaged my brain over the corse of the week by consuming alcohol and other narcotics, and I got 98%.  The quality of your day can make all the difference on a test.  
IQs prove nothing, NOTHING.  The entire show is the worst idea in history simply because it promotes and implies that sexism and racism is acceptable and that we should all take a part in it.  Not to mention Ben Stein is in the Celeberty panel.  And since his litterally the smartest guy in the world, You lose, game over.  Besides that, we all know the south will dramactically lower our national average anyways.

Fuck 'Test the nation' and any of you who were suckers enough to watch or do it.  Stupid fucks, I hope you die.  The whole show reaks so bad of racsim and sexism, that I makes me want to puke uncontrollably."

"event","The title of this piece has very little to do with the actual content, but I thought it sounded cool.

It's been awhile since I had anything to bitch about on here, not that I havnt had anything to bitch about, but things that I thought had no purpose being on here.

The first is more of an update then anything else.  I found more reasons to hate those fucking strollers yesterday.  I was walking to get an application yesterday, it was starting to rain, so I was busting my tar-filled withering lungs to move me quicker.  On my way home, I saw this nasty skank-bitch pushing a stroller ahead of me.  Now, Im not a religious man, but I prayed to god that I wouldnt have to follow her bloated ass wearing spandex all the way to my house.

WRONG!!!!

Now, this whore was clearly pushing her child around for 'excercize', being as she was dressed in sweats and spandex, and not only this, but she and her fucking 'childseat on wheels' were taking up the entire sidewalk.  'But why didnt you just pass her on the grass?'  Yeah, why didnt I.  know what?  Fuck you!  there is no grass there, only street and cars, then sidewalk.  After about 1 second of this slow bitch and her crying child slowing me down from being inside and smoking, I got pissed.  I swear she could feel me getting more and more pissed, and she tried to move her lard ass faster, yet the stroller slowed her down.  She kept frantically trying to move faster, as if her life were in danger because some random person behind her was pissed cuz she was moving slow.  here's an idea ya dumb slut!  Stop moving and let me pass you!  Wait!  even better, grab your child, ditch the stroller and run for your life!
Personally, I like that second option better, only because it would make me laugh and feel empowered.  
My point is simple, to all you mothers and fathers out there taking your kids in strollers out with you when you go for a walk around the block, don't do it.  Hell, you can get just as much excercize picking your kids up and down repeatidly, do the world a favor and keep your ugly asses and the kids at home, we all hate you and want you to die.  And when we tell you that your babies are so cute, what we really mean is one of the following.
1) Ha ha!  You stupid fuck!  You have kids, things which will leech of your for 18+ years and I don't.  God you are a sucker!
2) I hate children, and hate babies even more.  When I see yours I am reminded of the endless nights in which my own children would wake me up in the middle of the night complaining about wetting the bed/nightmares/crying.
3) I wish I could have children (This is done most frequently by Women, men want children only to increase their own laziness)
4) Your baby is not cute, infact it is disgusting.  Yet it is only a reflection of the parent's physical appearence.  Take your baby and your ugly selves away from me before I puke.
5) I want you to die.

Looking back, anyone who says 'your baby is cute' or any such things about a newborn along those lines, could mean multiple of the real meanings above.  Funny how all of us are so full of shit when it comes to sparing someone's feelings.

Equally amazing is how I managed to put 2 things that pissed me off today flow together so well.

Tip of the day: Your not special, go fuck yourself."

"event","-sighs- Myabe it was me, but the oscars this year lacked...well...everything.
It had no flair, it had nothing except who would win to keep us all interested.

<b>the biggest thing that went wrong this year</b>

Sean Penn 'Best actor'

This is just wrong.  Johnny Dep deserved this award more then anyone else.  While Penn did a good job in Mystic River, he was his uaualy self, doing what he gets paid to do.  This was a role suited for him.  He did not step outside his normal roles for this part.  He did in I am sam, but that was mearly him depicting himself off camera.  Ouch...that was mean.
Dep on the other hand, took a role that was so beyond what he normally does it almost made me piss my pants laughing.  Pirates of the Caribbean was, as a movie, not quite oscar worthy, I'm not going to say that it was.  Dep's performance, on the other hand, was by far the most impressive job from Dep...hell any actor I've seen in years.  Dep normally would choose a role thats far darker.  Watch the 9th gate, sums up his acting carrer very well.  Sure he stepped outside these roles with movies like Blow, but the vast majority of his roles are dark.
What made his performance so stunning was his ability to deliver a line with not just his mouth, but his entire body.  An actor is judged both on ability to perform lines as well as the way in which the line is delivered.  Dep did this and more.  He made Pirates of the Caribbean worth while.  Had...lets say Billy Crystal been Jack Sparrow, the movie would have most likely tanked.
Dep should have won, and fuck you if you can justify Penn's win.  Nobody did a better job then Johnny, and thats final.

Fucking oscars, they just get worse and worse as time goes on."

Is it just me, or is everyone sick and tired of these shitty, worthless Canadian coins being treated like our coins.  Last time i checked, Canada's currency was SIGNIFICANTLY worth less then ours.
Story time.
I just got back home from QFC because i ran out of coca puffs.  I grabbed a box and went to the cashier and dropped down a nice, new $20 bill.  American cash in and American store.  The total of the box of cereal was like $4.70 something after using that shitty Advantage card.  She gave me back my change, one $10 bill, a $5 and 3, yes 3, goddamn canadian 'dimes'.  She said have a good night and tried to push me out of the way so she could scam the next sucker.  I stood there, staring at her.  The bitch stole my goddamn money!  Fuck no if 3 canadian 10 cent pieces worth 30 cents in american cash.  She turned to look at me and asked rudely: 'is there a problem?'
I showed her the coins and she said so what.  this is where i wanted to bash her face in on the debit/credit card terminal.  She was such a pruney cunt, she thought I had done something wrong.  The whore cheated me out of a few cents, and while you all might be thinking: 'christ dan, its only a few pennies'

To that, i have to words for you


<b>FUCK YOU!</b>

Lets look at a few things Canadian coins DONT do, and where American coins would work.  
1 - Payphones.  Sure i havn't used one in a while, but suppose i had to?  No fucking odd sized Canadian coin works in those fucking things.
2 - Coin star.  Yes, i use coin star, piss off.
3 - Banks.  I can't deposit a Canadian 'dime' into the bank.  Why?  if its only worth lets say...7.3 cents american, I CANT HAVE 0.3 CENTS IN MY ACCOUNT ASSHOLE!
4 - 7-11.  I once went into 7-11 with a canadian 'quarter'.  when i tried to pay with it, i damn near got slapped in the head.  The guy told me to get the fuck out, litterally.

The list could go on and on.  Point being, I'm sick of these fuckers cheating me and everyone else out of our hard-earned american cash by giving us shitty and less valued Canadian cash.  Christ, the Canadians cant quit trying to clone us, now they're trying to make their money like ours.  Dirty fucking Canadians, hope Canada burns down and everyone there dies.  Fucking stoner-hosers ay?

(and yes, i did get my 3 american dimes, the wentch had to call her damn manager though, and even he was a fuck.  I'm calling QFC HQ tomarrow morning.  also, i swear to god if i get 10,000 responses from Canadians, or Canadian wannabes saying how im such a prick, fuck off and take a damn joke you bunch of ignorant pricks.)"

<b>Strollers Should be Illegal</b>
December 23rd, 2003

Alright, So i ventured to the mall today to fetch some pre-ordered shitty contraptions that my horrid family wanted for christmas.  Ofcourse the shithole was packed with morons just now getting started on buying crappy things for people they don't really like.  I laughed at them under my breath.  Anyways.  Now, this whole going into 2 stores and lay down my ID should have taken a matter of minutes, but no, a hour later i still only had 1 of the things i needed.  Why?  Asshole parents with those fucking god awful strollers to put their fat, whiney, shit machine children while they run around ignorant to the rest of the world and the inconvinience their stroller causes to the rest of the general public.
Heres a clue jackasses.  If your pushing around a kid in a stroller, WATCH WHERE THE FUCK YOU'RE GOING!!!  I got hit ATLEAST 6 times in 30 minutes in the damn mall.  Each time the parent looked at me like <b>I</b> did something wrong when the cock-sucker wasnt paying any attention to where he was going and litterally moved right in front of me while i was in mid step.
The question i have is, why arent there seatbelts in these things?  because the next damn time a stroller is about to hit me cuz some ignorant fuck up of a parent is pushing it, i'll give that stroller a quick kick and send their damn child to the other end of the fucking mall.
Know whats worse then a stroller?  one of those double strollers made for 2 kids, other then that, not mnuch compares to strollers being the worst thing on the planet.

<b>Modern Medicine...My Asshole!</b>
December 14th, 2003

Went to my doctor today to pick up some antidepressents.  He gave me a 19 page pamphlet on all the 'wonders of modern medicine and antidepressents' (actual quote).  I looked at each one, spending a grand total of a hour and a half looking for one that wouldn't make things worse for me.  You see, while these drugs may make you feel happy, they can also cause any number of horrid side effects that would defeat the purpose of antidepressants.  how is this so?  well i dont think that i'd be happy AT ALL if i had '<b>gasey with oily discharge'</b> OR <b>Sexual side effects</b> (notice they dont say exactly what effect it is, prolly impotence...)
So, my questions are these.  What is the point of marketing a drug that makes you happy if its side effects will only piss you off thus negating the point of the drugs?  
secondly, The hell is this shit?  some half finished medication?  
The entire world must be suckers to buy this shit and thus make these drug manufactuers rich.  I told my docter to fuck off if he was tryin to give me this shit.  He gave me Valium instead, atleast its only addictive, but better then then fart car oil or have my dick fall off.

<b>My Mother is the Scum of the Earth</b>
Sometime around Thanksgiving (was written on notepad not word, so i dont have a date)

Sexist, Favoritist bitch!  I'm so damn tired of my mother's crap i could kick her ass through the damn window.  She treats me like shit, tells me what i should do, thinks I owe her shit.  Fuck that.  I know whats better for me, and the hell if i owe her shit.  I built the goddamn house i live in now, if i hadn't, she'd have no place to live back when she split up with my father some 7 years ago.  She makes me go to the store to fetch her crappy ass food that even my cat won't eat, and when i tell her to fuck off cuz im busy, she gets pissed.  Think about this.  I dont eat ANYTHING that is within my house, i dont like it, it tastes like dog shit.  The <b>ONLY</b> thing she provides me with is Pepsi.  I pay 1/2 the electricity bill, i dont eat her food, and she doesnt pay rent anymore on the house.  She lives here for more or less nothing, except for standard trash, electricity, etc.  
And yet she has the nerve to say i do nothing?  Fuck her.  I have a job.  Sure it's not well paying...in fact...my job sucks hard all together.  She on the other hand works in a job which she meets absolutly ZERO requirements for by the law.  She runs a school and yet has none of the qualifacations needed for it.  She has a highschool diploma, thats about it.  No college, nothing.  I can do her job 1000x better then she can, and she comes to me to bitch about how all her 'certified and well qualified' employees bitch about how she does a shitty job and how they could do it better.
Guess what mom, do like you tell me, get yer ass back in school or shut the fuck up.
and the next time she asks me to move a box for her on my day off, i'll break her in half.

<b>My Sister, the Fair Weather Fan and the Football Retard</b>
December 30th, 2003

Ahh, WSU plays in the Holiday Bowl today.  Another day of my sister acting like she is the goddess of the knowledge of football.  Mandy, hate to break it to ya, Pass interference and Delay of game are not even close to the same penalty.  
She acts like she knows shit, and it pisses me off because she knows only this: the team with the highest score wins.  Duh!  thats so goddamn simple even my baby cousin can figure that shit out.  She doesnt know what downs are, she doesnt know why teams always do running plays stright up the middle of the defensive line.  The concept of the extra point or two point converstion took me 4 hours to explain to her, and then she bitches when a team ties the game up instead of risking losing and going to the 2 point.  Son of a bitch!
She's also the worst Fair weather fan ever.  Now that she Seahawks made the playoffs, she's wearing all Seahawks shit.  When the season first started i told her the Seahawks would make the playoffs this year.  She slammed me down and said that the seahawks always suck.  While that is no lie she told, if you suck the least in your league, ya make the playoffs (granted the seahawks didnt win their division, its a metaphor, shut the fuck up whiney tards).  Now that they're in, shes comming up to me sayin shit like 'i told you so.'  But she wont do that crap again, she said it twice to me within 3 minutes and got slapped as a result, she may be a fucking idiot, but she's smart enough to know to shut the fuck up when i get up, walk the length of my house and smack her one.
Yet another reason why my sister is a fat, lazy bitch.

<b>My Sister's 'Friend'</b>
Yesterday (January 1st, 2004)

Its a sad day today, my sister lost her friend.  Yes, thats right, i said 'friend'.  My sister has lost her friend.  Sound complicated?  Its not.  See, my sister is such a druken, slutty, horrid bitch that only one person at a time on this earth can be her friend.  This friend of hers rarely lasts more then 3 months.  Why?  she gets drunk and pisses them off by being a retarded whore.
But now that friend is gone, and so is the great entertainment and all the jokes i made of her because of it.  'Mandy, gunna invite your friend to your party?'
Ahh...classic shit ruined by my sister's drinking problem."

"event","Alright, lets all remember back a while ago when the 'greatest invention of the 20th century' was introduced, the Segway.  Indeed it was revolutionary...for about 5 minutes, then some people looked at it and realized how abolsutly useless it really is.  All this technology involved in this thing, more then my understanding, but from the sounds of it, not only should it cart my ass around but it should also do my taxes, cook dinner, and mow my fucking lawn (which i could actually impliment).  The very idea of the Segway screams of pathetic, inexcusable, laziness.  Look at it this way, there's not a chance in hell this thing will be able to get me down to Northgate, finish my chirstmas shopping, and get me back home, and since that wouldnt actually be THAT much work, it confirms that this device was intended to cart people's asses around their offices, homes, and what not.  Now, i am by no means active, i hate exercize, but WALKING isn't hard, and odds are damn good that walking would be faster in the end aways.
So we're going to have a little imaginary race here.  10 miles, 2 people.  1 person with a segway, another person just walking.  Who would win?  Well at first you all tend to lean towards the man with the Segway, and sure, at the start of the race he would shoot ahead.  BUT when his crappy segway breaks down on him and he has to cart the big, cumbersome piece of shit with him while walking to the finish line, he loses, why?  DUH!
I hate Segways.  People on them ride on the sidewalk and act like they own everything.  WRONG!  They expect me to move out of their way because they're 'driving' and $4,500 dollar hunk of shit.  WRONG!  I remember once when i was downtown walking, i saw a guy on a Segway.  Right before i was about to shout to the world that he was a moron, he crashed into someone because he wasnt paying attention.  The guy he hit should have beaten his ass, but no, instead he got up, had a few choice words with him and went on his way.  This made me laugh.  I want someone to run into me with a Segway, then i'll have to reasons for pounding their heads out their asshole.  But when things like this (http://www.bayareaseg.com/index2.html) happen, it makes me weap for humanity.
Moving along.
I was enjoying VH1 the other day, they had some good music on, but just like MTV, they also have this useless 'doesnt portain to music at all, but it might have something REMOTELY to do with a singer' shows.  Granted there are several good shows of this nature (i.e. Behind the music) but most of it (i.e. EVERYTHING on MTV) degrades american youth (i.e. My sister...but she degrades herself just as much) and ruins television.  Why is this?  well putting 6 people in big-ass apartment in NYC, free, for what is it 9 months?  and then giving them shit like trips to hawaii and what not.  Well all of that costs a bunch of money, hence the 90:10 ratio of commercials:programing on mtv.  So you spend 30 minutes of time watching MTV's real world when in actuallity yer getting more or less 3 minutes of advancment in the whole process of character development in the Real World.  so, lets say there are 24 episodes in one season of the real world.  at 30 minutes each, thats 12 hours.  but when adding in the 90:10 ratio thats 72 minutes, or 1 hour and 12 minutes, of development (note in this i don't count the fighting, the 'confession room' the walking around talking about who'se hot in the house, or the slow motion instant replay of events past, previews, reveiews, the drinking at bars, the puking, etc) so out of half a day's worth of hours, 72 minutes of that you get what you want and the remaining 10 hours and 48 minutes you're subjected to the same 12 commercials played over and over again.  being as i already made my point about advertising on here, i wont go into it.  No matter how you look at it, MTV blows ass, period.
Back to my VH1 story (and yes i know that MTV an VH1 are the same corporation).  The show after the music was a 'pop cultured' version of Life Styles of the Rich and Famous.  If you didn't know, LSotRF was a plague introduced to lower and middle class people in the early 80s.  The show took a certain celeberty, singer, actor, polition, Sports star, etc and basically showed us their wealth, power, and overall conceided additude towards anyone not worth several millions.  Thankfully LSotRF was canceled.  Why?  Well its simple.  The show lacked quality, entertainment, and generally made people feel like shit and/or killing the individual on the show.  This VH1 show was IDENTICAL to LSotRF, down to the cheap english accent host.
God, these kinds of show make me want to personally dismember these rich fucks.  You see, some people, while watching these shows think to themselves: 'hey!  maybe that could be me some day'.  While that IS a true statement, the odds are not staggering in your favor, much the opposite infact.  you're more likely to get struck by lighting, win the lottery, and drop dead all at the same second then become one of the rich fucks.  So when these people who think it could be them some day wake up and realized that they have been living in a dream world of thinking their shitty job will ever afford them such riches and power, they have been deprived of life.  This, i think, should be a legal issue to press charges over (if it were, MTV would be bankrupt and all of america's youth would be ungodly rich).  These shows aren't modivation, they're not uplifting.  They're shows about people who were born a foot taller then the rest, born with a good singing voice, or lied/cheated/killed their way to the top.  Looking back on it, Baseball players arent hardly EVER shown on these shows.  Why?  Because ANYONE can start playing baseball at a young age and be good, unlike baseketball, football, etc.
These shows are showing lower and middle class people things they will never in their life be able to afford, and that is cruel.  The producers of these shows should be killed in their sleep along with their entire family (including distant relatives, 3rd cousins, illigitimate sons or dauthers, long-lost brothers/sisters/uncles/ etc).
Life's a bitch, and being suckered into MTV, VH1, Pop culture, Segways, Advertising, and Shows that flaunt other people's weath only make life more of a bitch.  Don't be a sucker, and if you are, do the world a favor and shot your self or atleast don't breed."

"event","well...its like 2 am now, been writting now for about 6 hours or so.  For those who dont know, I've been writting a book(s) for years now, in hopes one day it'll get published.  I won't go into great detail about the content of it, but those who know of it already will understand.  But the story right now, rather of this exact moment, is more of a love story of sorts.  But for months now, I've been trying to get a certain part just right, its taken long enough.  It is not exactly as it is within the text of the book, i had to add a little bit here and there to this so that people would understand what has and what is going on, keep that in mind.  And...oh yeah...any criticism you might have feel free to shove up your assholes because i dont care what you think of this or why.
Like I said, those who already know of it will understand.  And so, here it is:

'The room was dimmly lit, with the usual cloud of smoke hovering just above everyone's head.  It was funny, that even amoung so many people that I could feel so alone.  The whole tavern rocked side to side with activity, for most these people it would be a night to remember, and for some who drank to heavily, a night soon forgotten.  How I wished that i fitted into that second group.  But the beer just didn't taste right that night...or rather my taste for it had been dulled that particular night.  It did not matter so much in the end, sober or not I knew I would have to deal with the impending events, and as it was of a fragile nature, it felt best to not drown it out with fine liquor.  
I sat apart from the rest of the mass of bodies.  Their fowl stench added in with their loud, abnoxious behavior was more then i could tolerate.  Under different circumstances, I would be with them, after all they had plenty to celebrate about.  The first decicive victory in this horse-crap war, it'd been years since they had something to be proud about.  While there is no doubt that I didn't feel the sense of joy they did, my mind was lost in it's own thoughts.
One of the more dominant thoughts at the moment made me chuckle to myself.  Not three months ago, this whole moment would have been impossible.  It was just three months ago that I came back out of my retirement of sorts, and this entire city errupted upon my arrival here.  I had hardly a moment of peace then, sitting in the shadows in this drunkard infested hole would have never happened.  They called me their savior, I was their hero.  But who was I to justly recieve their praise?  Who was I to justly be within the praiers of hundreds of thousands when I knew not even a quarter of them?  They placed far more faith in me then they should have.  They call me a hero when I'm not fitting of the title.  The heros are the ones who lay dead in the frozzen fields, bloody and battered, they made the ultimate sacrifice...while i survived, mostly due to their deathes.
But my thoughts were cut off when she finally entered the tavern, she was late.  I gave signal to the waitress for two more drinks, knowing that she wouldn't drink hers, but that I might have need of it before I left later.  Valerie stood in the door way for a moment, letting in the harsh winter winds, and for a moment, the retchedness of that place vanished and i had a breath of fresh air.  She spotted me and started sliding past the ever growing crowd of lumbering drunks, and with that the door closed, allowing clean air the vanish.  From what i could see, she appeared uninjurded from the losses her calvary suffered, but she had little time to unshoulder the burden of the battlefield.  She still wore her armor, though it was under a clean tunic now.  Her sword, as always, was at her hip, and her now empty quiver was slung on her back.  Her hair was washed and neatly tied back, perhaps the only thing she had time to clean.  There was still a little dirt smudged on her face, but it seemed to only compliment her facial bones in the light.  By the look of her, odds are good she was bogged down with meetings with Adam, something i should have done, but i could care less about Adam.  If he wanted to have a report of the battle, he should have come himself.
She showed no emotion on her face, which was indeed rare, this only increased the feeling of impending doom i felt within my gut.  She came up to the table and took the seat facing directly infront of me.  Thrusting her elbows on the table and resting her chin on her hands she gave me a tired hello.  I simply nodded in response, only because words escaped me.  This was the first personal meeting between her and I in almost a year.  Sure we'd run into eachother here and there, exchange casual 'hellos', but nothing of this sort.  Perhaps this meeting was a little overdue.
We sat in silence for a moment.  Her eyes fixated on mine, awaiting my words.  I, on the other hand was waiting for my drinks.  Being around her parched my throat.  When my drinks were finally delivered, one was sat near each of us, Quickly Valerie pushed hers away.  'Well Dan,'  she said.  'What is it?'
Right to the point, as much as i expected from her.  I took a healthy gulp from my drink and cleared my throat.
'It's nice to see you again.' I said.  I leaned back in my chair, it was far more uncomfortable sitting that way, but it put more distance between her eyes and myself.  Again, we were silent.  She expected more from me then what I had said.  She blinked rapidly at me, a sign of frustration.
'That's it?'  She cried.  'After a year of silence?  After a year of not hearing or speaking to you all you can say is that it's good to see me?  Christ Dan, THIS is what you wanted to talk about?'  She was angry with me now.
I massaged my eyes for a moment.  'You should know better then that by now...' I mummbled.  'Maybe this talk between us is longer overdue then i thought.'
'That's not it Dan.'  She sighed.  'I've got a lot to do right now, and it's better if we just get this over with.  I know exactly why you wanted to talk with me tonight, that much isn't a surprise.'
'I suppose i should start by appologizing then?'  I asked.
'Appologizing for?'  She Inquired.
'Well...when last we met, we left under difficult circumstances.  Then i simply ignored you for a year, and then, when i came back i continued to ignore you.  Isn't that enough for an appology?'
'It was not entirly your fault Dan.'  She said.  ' I could have just as easily written a letter to you, so i suppose part of that blame rests with me.'
I leaned foreword again to take another drink from my mug.  she slid back in her chair, atleast she felt as uncomfortable about all this as i did.  She looked unhappy now.  I had stirred up memories and emotions that she'd pushed back for a year.  She tried her best to hold back her tears, but try as she might, one managed to escape and roll down her cheek.  slowly i brought my hand to her cheek and let the tear roll onto my finger, she let out a little smile.
'I'm an idiot Valerie.' I told her.  'Looking back on what happened, it was a mistake, one of many I made during that time.  I never should have left you, I should have never left here.  I knew it seconds later after i did it.'
'And yet you still went through with it all...' Valerie said as more tears rolled down her face.  'Why?'
'I...have no idea.'  I confessed.  'Had i known what would result of it all, I would have done differently.  If i had only known the agony and the pain that you would feel and the torture i would have endured because of it...Each day was a nightmare after that.  I felt empty inside...'  Again i was at a loss for words,  I could feel the tears welling in my own eyes, and it took my concentration to push them back.  I promised myself i wouldn't get emotional.  Valerie sat with her eyes closed, arms folded accross her chest.  The rest of the taverns patrons paid no attention to us, which i was thankfull for.  While we sat, I finished my drink and then moved on the the second one. 
Half way through that mug she spoke again.  'What's your point Dan?'  She asked coldly and abrutly.
'My point?'  I asked.  'My point is that I'm sorry for what i did to you...I guess.'  
'That's not what i mean and you know it.' she scolded.
I sighed.  She found me out, but that was hardly news.  She always had her way of reading my mind.  'I still love you Val...' I whispered.  'And i can't change what happened between us.  If you could see the hundreds of letters i wrote you but never sent.  Not a day went by when i didn't wish to be by your side, there was hardly a moment that you didn't come into my mind.  It tore me apart that the only thing i ever wanted in this world was unreachable for me and it was all due to my own foolishness.  I managed to ruin not only the greatest friendship i've ever had, but also the greatest relationship I ever had.'  I started crying now.  'Damn this love, damn it for still existing, even now it tears me apart.  But it can't be helped.  And now, seeing you with...with him...makes it all the worse.  I can't stand seeing you two together and i slap myself for being the cause of it all...there is no chance is there?'
She asked me what i ment by that last statment, but she knew what i was aiming at, she just wanted to hear me say it.
'There is no second chance is there?' I sighed.
She said simply: 'no'
I was crushed, and despite my best efforts not to show it, I'm sure it was more then obvious.  I Had nothing more to say after that, and she wouldn't say anything more either, so we sat for what felt like hours quietly.  I avoided her gaze, staring down at my boots, but i could feel her eyes burning into my skull.  I just couldn't let her see me like this.
'Well...' She announced, breaking the silence.  'I've got things to do, so I'll get going now.'  She stood up and walked over to me and gave me a hug.  Instinctivly i hugged back.  With a kiss to my forehead she left.  I sat motionless for hours.  Occasionally the waitress would walk by and ask a question of me but i would wave her off.  
When finally the crowd in the tavern started to disperse, i sat up and walked out.  The cold air was soothing, the night was dead quiet.  My thoughts and emotions had been burnt out, i felt numb.  Only the soft crunching of the snow beneath by heavy iron boots could be heard, like the whole world felt my pain and took this moment in silence in honor of it.  The weight of my armor dragged me down.  I knew i should get to bed, I had a long day of riding ahead of me and battles to plan, but what was the use?  What was the use of going on when the only thing that mattered to me in this world was beyond my reach, and essentially dead to me?  While the war was important, it felt small in comparison to my own woes.
That was the longest walk of my life, and when finally i reached the barracks, Alan and Joseph greeted me.  Instantly they realized what had happened, and said nothing more then a greeting, while they were like my brothers, it would have to wait till the morning before i would confide in them my secret.  My bed never looked so inviting, i fell upon it making a loud clang of iron.  I cried for a while more before finally drifting off to sleep, full suit of armor and all."

"event","It's really quite boring, having nothing to do all day long.  Some would gladly welcome this kind of opportunity, but they're stupid.  Having litterally nothing to do gets boring and frustrating.  It leaves with me with excess time, time i'd much rather be out earning some damn money and not watching day time TV because every other thing i can think of to do has been done and EVERYTHING is boring.
The problem with all this time is simple.  All i can do is sit around while my thoughts go through my head.  You see, this wouldnt be a problem had the last couple of months...well not happened.  To sum up my decisions of the last few months: i cheated myself.  I allowed myself to get put back into a situation that i knew, that i KNEW would end up like this.  More litterally, i choose to get myself involved with someone again when i shouldn't have.  Guess my will anit all that strong hmmm?  Doesnt really surprise me.  Temptation is a bitch, and i caved like a sissy.  But hey!  on the plus side, atleast i can admit it now.
Modern medicine is great...or atleast my doctor is.  To explain, Antidepressents dont work with me...or atleast they dont really do what they're supposed to do.  Valium.  It's really good stuff.  You see, he figured if he cant make me feel happy, he'll just make me feel nothing at all, and by nothing i mean nothing.  but its a double edged sword really.  Just because i dont feel anything, doesnt mean my judgement is clouded, nor my thoughts inhibited.  It simply means that when the fucker in front of me is driving slow, My mind recognizes that it should piss me off.  I then in turn realize that i should be pissed off...but i dont really feel...anything and thus dont care about most everything else.  You see the delimma?  
Now im tired..."

"event","Honesty...bah!  'All i want is you to be honest with me'  I hear that bullshit every day.  my response?  i draw up some crap to satisfy them for the time being.  But let this be a proclimation: No!  you dont want me to be honest with you!  Why?  What good does being honest with people do?  It doesnt fix problems, it doesnt make them go away.  Most the time it just makes the bullshit problem worse.  Everyone lies, everyone does it to get the hell past some little meaning less, trivial problem that some elephant testicle bitch brought up.  Jesus!  All you want is for me to be honest with you?  do you enjoy feeling like crap even monkey's wont fling?  being honest, completely honest, is the worst thing you can do.  You speak your mind and you tell everyone exactly how it is, and to be honest people cant deal with that ammount of it.  
You want me to be honest with you?  Fine fuckers, i'll be honest with you.

I've had enough of everyones ass-clowning around.  People assume whats best for me, and then act accordingly without asking me.  For example, lets say you assume kicking me square in the nuts with boots coated in steel spikes is whats best for me.  And because you assume this you do it on a regular basis without asking me first if it is indeed best for me.  Now, i dont want to be kicked in the nuts buy steel-spiked boots, in fact it would just piss me off more then i already am.  So what does this tell you dumbasses out there?  STOP ASSUMING WHATS BEST FOR ME AND ASK!  I will ALWAYS know whats best for me, why?  if you dont know the answer to that question, go decapitate yourself now before you have the chance to have children.
Next.
Let me clear another thing up.  I hate...well...damn near all of you.  Its nothing to take to litterally, but you all piss me off more then you can possibly know.  The scary thing: this is normal.  People, since the dawn of time have pissed eachother off.  Surprised?  Im not and neither should you.  ""But Dan, if we make you so mad, why do you hang out with us?""  AHHHHHHHHH!!!  Are you retarded?  Illiterate?  Read a little above before you ask such dumb questions.  To live in a world where everyone got along and nobody made anyone else mad would be boring.  Sure there'd be no war, but there'd be no meat either, us NORMAL people would cave in to those fucking VEGANS and stop eatting meat cuz it gets their vegi-panties in a bunch.  You see what im getting at here?  If so, then dont be surprised if i get mad at you.  Dont get all shocked with your jaw dropped when i get pissed off at you.  Its happened before, and odds are damn good it'll happen again.  Want some advice?  When im pissed at you, dont bother asking whats wrong, dont cry, dont bother trying to fix things because its When I decide im done being pissed off that i'll get over it.
Next.
Now for some more personal shit.  I dont know why, but people feel the need to avoid certain topics/persons/items/ in general conversation with me.  Like im going to flip out when they mention it and bash their heads in.  For an example, I'll use Liz because its something anyone who reads this knows well enough.  Does it bother me that i let one individual ruin...well...a good chunk of my life?  You're goddamn right it does.  But does this mean you should avoid saying anything about her when im talking to you?  Fuck no.  If i were that pussified over it, i'd have log ago cut all ties with her and anyone else who was in contact with her.  Again, you assume shit that you shouldnt.  Am i still pissed off over what transpired between Liz and myself?  thats really not any of your damn business now is it?  But i'll humor you.  Yes, to a degree i am.  But does this mean i wont welcome her friendship?  no, im more then able to deal with my shit, you neednt help me out.  Im a big boy, i can take care of myself, you jsut worry about you...asshole.

I swear to god.  Even if i were honest, such as i was here tonight, with people, they wouldnt get it.  Call it thickness, ineptitude, or whatever...they'll never understand one goddamn thing.  Trust me people, honesty from me is the last thing you want...atleast full, unedited honesty anyways.
Good night, im going to bed."

"event","It has been a interesting week to say the least.  I've expirenced more great highs (not litterally, as you should know I dont do that shit) and depressing lows this week then any other I can recall.  What comes to ming, to be honest, is pain.  Now this pain should have been long and done with a year ago, but as you can see, its not quite over yet.
Evan told me tonight to: 'stop being angry all the time.'  He knows something that many of you may not.  My 'anger' is just a front, thats all it is, was, and ever will be.  It is not my nature to be angry at everything and mean.  Those of you who know me best will know my real personality, and it has nothing to do with the following words: Happiness, anger, or being sweet guy people say I am.
Yes, this act i put up is indeed a problem, a psychological one at that.  But tell me, thos who presume to judge me, what would you have me do?  Have me be honest with myself as well as everyone else?  This isnt as easily done as you all say it is.  Well...actually, it would be quite easy for me, but...difficult for the rest of you.  I'd vent years and years of frustration with all of you.  At this time, it is not something i really want to do.
But nobody can front forever.  I feel...drained.  The extensive shield i put up has been beaten down to practically nothing, and will take very little to ruin my day, so to speak.  
It pisses me off people can be just so fucking happy.  I dont understand this whole concept anymore.  Maybe its because ive been so goddamned unhappy that im numb to happiness?  who knows.  But i watch all the people around me honestly be happy with themselves and their life, and realizing i havnt felt that way in so long and that i see no way of feeling that way again aggrivates me to no end.  People, who by all rights, should feel like crap walk around being mr. and ms. sunshine.  FUCKERS!
There is no the the frustration for me.  Dont be surprised if you hear from me again...soon.

"event","My Sister is a Dumb, Fat, Lazy Bitch Part 2

Now, when last i approached this subject, i touched on her increasing weight, poor diet and poor life habits.
But wait!  Theres more!

So, just 2 days ago, my sister is ofcourse drunk and comming home from work.  Now the freeway is currently undergoing repairs from a damn tanker that exploded a few weeks ago.  Now, theres only one lane of moving traffic, and that lane has...rough pavement.  Add beer + one dumb, fat, lazy bitch + rough pavement and you have exactly one blown out tire. Now, let me give you a perspective.  Her tire blew out near the Lynwood mall, i live just South of northgate.  She drives her car to 145th (the border of Seattle and Shoreline) on a wheel scrapping against the ground.  hole-ee-shit.  She calls me and wakes me up at 3 in the goddamn morning.  So i drive down there and pick her up.  She procedes to tell me what happened.  Now, its 3am.  Im tired, hungry, pissed off that i got woken up, but i understand whats going on with her, so im sympathetic.  She goes and puts her hand on the tire.  this is the exact conversation.
'its hot!'
'yeah, i kinda figured.  you drove the car dragging that axle on pavement.'
'oh...'
(shes STILL not in my car at this point.)
'well theres nothing we can do about it tonight mandy.  so lets go so i can go back to sleep.'
'jesus dan...'
'what?'
This is where she procedes to get pissed off at me for some unknown reason.  Apparently my request for her to get in my car so we can leave was to unreasonable.  She got all sorts of pissed at me, and since im naturally defensive, i got pissed at her for gettin mad at me for no goddamn reason what so ever.  
That was just the beginning.
The next day, she needs to go to work.  But she has no goddamn tire on her car, she has that little tiny piss-ant of a tire on there.  i offer to drive her, saying that her little donut wont last, she says it will and leaves.  She's absolutly stunned when that little donut is flat and fucked up when she gets off work.  again  hole-ee-shit.
-sigh- so then on Monday, i get asked to drive her car down to the tire place.  i say fuck no, anit my car, anit my problem, IM AT WORK ASSHOLES!!!  20 minutes later im at discount tires, why?  to stop my mother and sister from bitching.  Only now im in my car and throw the new tire in my car and drive home, this take about 2 hours...oh yeah...might i add im not getting paid for this time away from work?

now, to link this post to the other.  when i first picked my sister up that night, she told me i'd be the last person she'd call next time something like that happened.  i started laughing.  she asked why.  i told her the simple truth, she has no friends, nobody but myself, and my meth-head sister to call.
funny shit man, funny shit.
conclusion:  My sister has no right being behind the wheel of a car.  She couldnt tell you the difference between a radiator and a engine block.  She has no concept of what it means to drive.  Frequently intoxicated, it is only a matter of time before she plows herself into a telephone poll, house, park, or another car.  Her lisense has been void since she turned 20 years old.  and she treats all her cars like crap.  Anyone who saw her saturn can testify to that.  She's very nearsighted and refuses to wear her glasses because ""they make me look ugly""

sorry sis, it anit the glasses, its the beer fat, the scars from picking at your damn scabs, its the being a Dumb, Fat, Lazy Bitch that makes you ugly."

"event","In life, from time to time, we question our whole beings.  But in the end, we only search for some place where we belong.  Now, by this, i dont mean simply where we fit in with soceity, rather i mean where we, as individuals, belong in our own little worlds.
Such is my moral delimma currently.
In recent weeks ive attempted to make amends with many people, there are a few who i feel i shouldnt bother with, not to say i dont exactly like their whole removal from my life, but i feel as though there is nothing i can do about it, thus it isnt worth my time to even attempt patching things up.  Now out of all these people i've contacted, ive gotten a response from about 15% of them...not exactly the response i'd hoped for but theres not much i can do other then what i've already done.
Now, at the end of this summer, i find myself in a difficult spot.  to put it lightly i do not have a home to live in at the end of this summer, meaning my mom is kicking me out unless i am going to school...how kind.  Now the real is not weither or not i go to school, the problem is how am i to afford it?  my mother certainly wont pay for it, which leaves me at a disadvantage.  Now granted ive never liked, nor had much of, having things handed to me.  Damn near everything i have i had to work for (or steal for =p), so naturally my instinct is to grab a job.  This had been taken care of at the school, but untill today when i found out that i was under the microscope there, i decided that the school was no place for someone such as myself.  What royally pisses me off about this is the simple fact that there is no one, i repeat no one at the school who actually engages with the children more then myself.  I play every game they come up with, i am around them constantly while the other teachers mearly stand, drinking their coffee while talking to one another.  There has NEVER been a teacher more loved by the kids at that school more then myself.  And it is not because i let them off, becuase i dont.  i am rigid with the rules set before me, i just simply interact with the children more then anyone else.
Heres a fine example.  Originally, i was put in charge (in some ways) of this summer program, only because i've had more expirence then any of the other current employees.  Now a week into it, Nita shows up.  Now Nita is a long time veteran of the school.  She was there when i attended the summer programs as a child.  Nita took over my job, which in some ways, i was thankful for.  So how is that a problem?  Nita was given directions by Chris (the owner of the school) and my mother to watch my actions.  Nita then went and informed the other teachers to report to her of what i did.  Now in no way am i supposed to know about this.  But Adam, my good friend and long-time co-worker told me the first week he was there, he felt i should know that i am being watched by everyone.  
Now, under normal circumstances, this kind of poltical bullshit wouldnt bother me.  But when Nita comes to me and tells me flat out that i can no longer do what it is that i do which makes the kids actually ENJOY their time there with me, thats when i have a problem.  ""Dan,""  She said.  ""I've heard that you have been doing (insert bullshit here) with the kids.""  I nod.  ""We can't have you doing that.""  I nod.  ""Blah blah blah blah blah..."" i walk away pissed off.
Her entire argument could have been summed into: Don't have fun with the kids anymore.
So what do i get to do now?  empty the garbage...i am a janitor.  Granted i still go on the field trips, i still spend time with the children, but that is not the point.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that i tell these kids how the real world works, instead of filling their heads with all this new bullshit 'politically correct' stuff, where anyone can do anything they want to and that their rights are exactly as they are in the constitution.  Its simple, in this world of law suit-happy parents, the world is catering to their demands, which in turn make their children a) act out at a pathetically rigid society b) become weak and soft due to inexpirence with the world and c) forces them to accept that they are 'precious little angels'.
Look, when i was a kid, we ate shit that fell on the floor.  We climbed trees, we rode our bikes without helmets, we did all sorts of fucking stupid things.  And when that stupid shit came back to bite us in the ass, we learned from it.  Why?  because expirence, not a text book, is the single greatest teacher in the world.  I can recite all my stories of my mishaps to these kids and yet they will not understand untill they expirence it themselves.  There is no more 'deep end' in public (and i assume private) pools anymore.  Wallingford playground is gone, replaced by some 'little whiney bitch kid-friendly safeground'.  As a society of paranoid parents and mentally challenged kids, we are destorying our nation's future.  And why?  becuase parents have become lazy in raising their children, they dont watch them at playgrounds anymore.  When a kid breaks his arm at a playground, its no longer the parent's fault for not watching their own child, nor is it the child's fault for being a retard, it is the city's fault for putting such a 'dangerous' play ground there.  I never once seriously hurt myself at a playground.  Why?  because i knew what i could and could not do because i was raised on expirence.  So what it all boils down to is our own destruction of our own children.  pitty.
Now, i understand that the above little story has nothing to do with my original post, but as this may very well be my last post, i figure i might as well say that little bit too.  
In my ever-lasting search to find myself, i find my time now running short.  Before i move on, i would simply like to say im sorry to those i fucked up with, weither or not they respond to me isnt any of my business, after all, i tried.  
But now...i cant remember where this all was going...
damn it!
well, it must not have been all that important.  But i'll leave with a simple point.  There are no dead ends in life, you never have to backtrack.  If you look hard enough and are willing to take the risk there is always a way foreword, even if it means off-roading a little bit.
So thats the end.  No more bitching, no more ranting, complaining, or starting crap with people.  I Choose to move on, and not look back anymore."

Well...we all know its the truth, but you know, people who say it are attacked for being sexist.
so, since i have absolutly nothing else to do, might as well piss someone off for fun

Women...goddamn women...
That alone is a great saying.  but how exactly did that saying start?  well...allow me to explian.  You see, time and time again, through out history, we men have noticed a trend.  Women are attracted to money and power.  Funny how it is that i have neither of those.  now, dont get me wrong, there are some women who are attracted to the personality of some guys, which i also lack.  And ofcourse theres the shallow girls, the ones who only notice looks, which again, i dont have.
Now, keep in mind that that little rant does not include all women, but in my history with women 80% of them seem to follow that tid-bit of information.
So...i wonder why i cant seem to find a girlfriend.  lets see...i have no money, no power, no personality, and anit great in the looks department.  so basically this leaves me totally screwed...er...rather...not...damn...now i confused myself.
anyways, figure that shit out, and yes i know im rather sexist, but hey!  im also racist apparently too, whatever

part 2.

i have yet another reason to hate pop culture.  Pop culture is creating a bunch of uncultured little fucks who cant respect anything that doesnt involve sex, drugs, rap, guns, violence, and sex.
Just this weekend i had a first hand expirence with some of this little twats who cant seem to shut the fuck up when someone who knows that the hell they're talking about tells them what a total ass they are and that they're fucking retarded and need to be beated by a baseball bat (me?  bitter?!?  nah...).
This all started simply.  There is a goddamn difference between oldies music and classic songs.  it just so happens that a lot, A LOT of classic songs are 'oldies'.  What these narrowminded little fucks fail to realize is that the little ass clown know as P. Diddy rapes these classic songs and turn it into some sick piece of shit pop song.  Now, We, people of/around my age (20 years old) were growing up in the birth of pop culture.  We still had that terrible 80s techno bull crap when 'pop music' was comming around.  By the time pop culture took hold, MOST of us were already past the age in influence.  Meaning we werent brainwashed like all these other 'gang-banging, gun-packing, etc, etc, etc -insert cliche here-' little minors (under 18)
These pig fuckers have absolutly no respect for what came before them.  They cant grasp that hippy music, from the 60s to early 80s, was its own damned culture and MADE THE CRAPPY SONGS by people like Joe Buddin (or how ever its spelled) POSSIBLE!!!!!!  I watch this fool on Mtv.  His song is only about drinking, fucking, doing drugs, killin people, etc etc etc.  WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF REDEMING VALUE IS THAT SONG???  ITS NOT!!!!!!!!!  HE SHAMELESSLY THROWS HIS NAME OUT THERE IN A SAD, DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO MAYBE GET A FEW MORE MILLION DOLLARS FROM HIS LABEL.
Now this dork will grow up, and his kids will want to see the kind of music he made when he was younger, naturally he'll show them.  If his kids had any brains what so ever they'd commit patracide and then later suicide.  why?  because their father was just a leech of poor, simple minded twits that pop culture has produced and then they should kill themselves for being related to him.  i can see the headlines now... 'mass murder and suicides of popculture stars and their children'
ahh...that'll be a great day, wont it?
But how am i different?  how do i not fall into this sick, depressing crap hole that my friends brother and his friend exist in?  i have respect.  plain and simple.  I dont diss a classic song like 'American Pie' just because its something i dont know about and was before my time, or better yet!  cuz some cock-sucking ass pirate like P. Diddy hasnt remade it yet.  Ever wonder why the great songs are only covered instead of remade?  because the singers atleast know not to fuck with classic songs, because someone like me might just end them.
Next i move on the the mass homophobics out there, who just happen to fall in the above catagory.  This, again is largey due to fear and popculture as well as our own society.  the overused cliche-ish excuse: 'im not homophobic, i just hate fags' is a useless, low cal, small brained attempt to some how make themselves feel better about being homophobic.  Now, i dont fully comprehend this mass histeria.  what are you all so scared of?  being raped by a homosexual?  the odds of that are minimal.  You really want to know why it has all come to pass?  We like in a world 'dominated' by men.  And homosexual men scare the shit out of some hetrosexual males and those who are overly religious.  Funny how it works out that lesbains are accepted...makes ya think, dont it?
And because of this fear we have homosexual men being beated to death, being persecuted at every damn turn.  Fuck you! you silly bastards who have been brainwashed by Popculture.  Fuck you!  you stupid twats who took Eminem's music at face value.  Fuck you!  All of you.

oh yeah... g'night too...



stupid fucks...

"event","well, its offical, my sister now weighs exactly 30 pounds more then i do.
now i come in around 195-200ish which means she weighs about 230.  Now my sister is about as athletic as a corpse, so i anit been muscle shes putting on, its pure, 100% beer fat.  Now im no stranger to alcohol, i drink it well and often enough, but she takes drinking to a new extreme.  
Lets now venture into a typical week of my sister -shivers- im scared.
Monday she wakes up around noonish from a hard night of drinking sunday night.  she eats...mac and cheese for breakfest, ooohhh way to get your day started.  The pan and bowl she used will sit in the sink for weeks.  she'll leave to work (assuming she works that day) at around 4:30-5PM.
Tuesday - thursday are much alike...except she drinks on these days after she gets off work, she'll never drink on a Monday.
Friday-Sunday.  In between work and eatting shes at a bar, consuming rapid ammounts of all kinds of booze.

Now heres the punch line.  She has no friends anymore.  Damn near EVERYONE she was friends with cant stand her anymore.  this is for many reasons.  She wears shoes with no socks, her feet smell worse then a rotting human body, it gets so bad i cant leave my room for hours after she's left the living room.  She drinks too much.  One can only drink so much and do NOTHING else for so long and not get bored of it.  To my sister's friends, she's modivation.  They dont want to have a shithole life like she does; ruled by the desire to drink.  While everyone she knows has seen her pathetic state and have made their lives better, moved on from a fuck-up of a life, she remains, ever the drunk, stupid whore that is my sister.  
While everyone around her goes and makes themselves a better person, she continues to take bullcrap classes at a community college, works dead-end jobs, and thinks that going away to another college out of seattle, its going to make everything alright.
She doesnt realize that if she doesnt get her shit together, all this 'college education' shes getting means about as much as a sack of rocks.  she doesnt challenge herself with courses, hell she doesnt even take courses in the field she wants to go in.  And she thinks that i am the stupid asshole for not going to college, dumb whore!  i have every intention of going back to school, but not untill i KNOW what i want to do.
Everyone, my sister is a shinning example of what not to become.  Take to heart her poor, pathetic ways, learn from them and her.
If you be like my sister, i'll kill you, the world has enough of people like her."

concerning my current 'plans' for this summer.  let me make something clear to y'all.  

someone told me 'arent you worried about losing frineds over this?'
well...to be honest, i dont give a shit what other think about me, or my actions.  you see my plans, for the most part, dont involve any of my friends.  so their getting pissed at me for something imma go and do seems retarded to me.  their puttin themselves in a place where they dont belong, and thus become in my way, and im not letting much get in my way.
So lets get our facts in order shall we?  alright, you all are gunna hear some shit about me, some true.  yer gunna hear shit thats gunna want to make ya punch me in the head.  know what?  try it, bring it on.  so you wanna get vengence on behalf of someone else?  fine, but that makes you another target in my eyes, and if you havnt learned the golden rule about me yet, then let it be known.  'DONT FUCK WITH ME'
thats the golden rule.  you see, i dont like pissing people off...well...to the degree where they feel the need to fuck with me.  cuz you see, then i have to devise a horrid way of returning the favor, execute the plan, and the loop goes on and on.  as far as EVERYONE is concerned my plans concern only one person, nobody else.  so why should anyone else put themselves in my way?  well i dont know, but i know that its going to happen no matter what i say to everyone.  with that in mind, you should know that i have sorts of backup plans, plans that involve other people as my targets, you know...for when they decide to fuck with me.
*sigh* people will never learn to mind their own shit.  its a problem that ranges far and wide, take for example the US' involvment in the middle east, we didnt mind our own shit and look where it got us.
people need to stop playing the goddamned hero, seriously.  i care about my friends and dont enjoy having to fuck with them back, but i dont back down either.
again, the golden rule 'dont fuck with me'

so with that in mind, the show now starts, precisely at 1:20 am, PST on Wednesday, June 18th 2003.  sit back, relax, remember to buy some snakes from the concession stand in the lobby.  
enjoy the show

"event","I swear, i must have some sleep disorder or something.  I stay up till the early hours of the morning, playing nexus, watching tv.  it sucks.
Last night was no different, however i saw that retarded ad for dr. scholls crap.  'hey ellen, you gellin?'  'im gellin like a felon...want some melon?'
makes me sick, the state of our country.  What the fuck does that ad have ANYTHING to do with what that product is for?  let me enlighten you, it has nothing to do with it, its just another catchy, bullshit ad on tv, just like the other half a million.  Now, my stance on advertising isnt exactly a great one.  I hate, HATE comercials.  Sports stars, movie stars, popular music and their singers are flashed before our eyes pushing some shitty product in hopes that we'll buy them.  What these corporations fail to realize is that just because they show us Kobe Bryant drinking a sprite doesnt make us all want to drink it.  Spirte was around long before Kobe bryant made his NBA appearence, seeing him didnt make me want to drink it more, in fact, i stopped drinking it after i saw him shamelessly endorce it.  You see, here in America, the vast majority of consumers already know what they like, and what works.  Comercials are redundant, they dont work.  seriously, when was the last time you saw a comercial and afterwords said to yourself: 'Holy shit!  i have to have that now!  If (insert famous person's name here) uses it, so should i!'
If you've done that in the last year, give me your address so i can drive to your house and beat your head in.  Seeing a ad for lets say...shoes.  Now i wear currently nike.  But suppose i see a ad for adidas, does that comercial make me want to use one shitty brand of shoes over another?  no.  it just wastes my time, paying network executives millions.  Now, there are a few kinds of comercials that work, basically the ones for the shit that hasnt come out yet (i.e. movies, video games, etc) and the ones that wont be here for ever (i.e. sports events).  those work, because there are plenty of people like me who dont give a flying fuck about these things, but suppose i feel the desire to attend one of these pathetic events, how the fuck am i going to know if one's already here?  not like im going to take time out of my busy schedual of watching tv and playing video games to look, but a ad will always show up, telling me whats going on.  Point and case, 90% of all advertising is a waste of time, money, and the asshole consultant who came up with that shitty idea for a comercial.
Related to comercials, the media in general is getting to the point where i can't stand it.  By media, i dont mean simply the news, i mean the radio, tv, and ALL other forms of that crap.  Lets take a current sports event for example.  Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs got cought using a corked bat, which is illegal in baseball.  Now, this isn't the first time someone got cought using a corked bat, nor is it the first time a hall of famer got cought, and yet theres this huge blow up about it. IT WAS ON THE COVER OF THE GODDAMN NEWSPAPER!!!!!!!!  Now, Sosa has litterally millions of dollars, possibly billions.  So what does this whole media explosion do to him?  well, it ruins his reputation in baseball...im sure he's crying alll the way to the bank.  Its fucked up that we're willing to pay someone who plays a FUCKING GAME millions of dollars while there are artists who produce great works of art and culture, and teachers who are building our future absolutly jack shit.  Anyone here want to know why our educational system here in america is similar to that of a third world county?  because ALL the teachers out there WANTED to be teachers, its not because they're pay is godly, they wanted to.  'But Dan, how is that a bad thing?' you might ask.  simplton...look, i've had some of the smartest teachers available, they knew their shit, and tought me what i needed to know.  but i've also had some of the most retarded teachers in the history of teachers.  they're fucked up in the head and some sick psychological tweak in their brain made them want to be a teacher when they have litterally nothing to offer a student other then whats in a text book.  Now any jackass can teach a text book, you, me, my mother, my 8 year old cousin, anyone.  why?  because you dont have to teach anything.  you say 'read this crap and remember it'  thats it.  its a hell of a lot harder teaching someone why that crap is in a text book, why we should remember it, how it's relevent to today.  Those kinds of teachers are few and far between.  Now, in my life i've met some seruiosly intelegent adults, who have more philosophical depth then most, and yet they choose a profession like tile setting, carpentry, and other remedial tasks other then sharing their wisdom.  now why did they do this?  because a teachers salery cant support their needs.  plain and simple.
Back to the media.  Surely there is more important shit going on in the world...no...this country, hell this state, even better yet this city more important then Sammy Sosa using a corked bat?  i know for a fucking fact there is.  Every day someone does something amazing, something to help someone else, and yet instead of recognizing them, honoring then, we spit shit out about crap that doesnt even matter to us, like this whole corked bat issue.  Its fucked up that we're a country at war, where our countrymen and women are dying in another country and all we report about is a fucking baseball player.  There is better shit going on in this world then someone breaking the rules of a game that 12 year olds play for fun.  Our media needs to stop making the american people more retarded by displaying this horsecrap, they need to make us more aware of our world, and whats going on by telling us shit that we cant see happening.  they need to fill our heads with the real world issues, not playing a 20 minute segment about baseball's history with corked bats.  point and case, the media is bullshit.
You know that song by Nsync 'Pop'?  yeah, doesnt that song make you want to induse vomiting?  i agree.  Im soooooooooooo tired of this 'pop culture' crap.  Now some great things have come from it, good music, good tv, but the vast majority of it is filler.  shit people threw together to further suck our youth into bliss, and thus making them retards.  Music has always and will always be a huge influence on the world and its people.  but redeming qualities does Puff Daddy's music have?  or J-lo's?  or The Backstreet boys?  i'll tell you.  they're just playing off all the suckers out there, they're playing off what is popular at the moment and getting bank for doing so.  Now dont get me wrong, i like some of their shit, but am i going to pay $20 for a cd with that shit on it? fuck no.  I'll download it for free on the internet.  You see, its not the artists who lose money from piracy, its the labels that put their trash out on the market.  Artists make little to no money based on the sales of CDs, the label pays them to make a album (and pays them well i might ad) and then recoups its expenses from CD sales.  and you know what?  even if it was the artist who lose money, fuck them, and shame on them for being leeches of misguided youth.  The whole music industry revolves around 'beautiful people'  for example, i'd like to use Jewel.  Now, this young lady from Alaska hit the scene awhile ago, singing heartfelt songs about love and what not.  very home grown girl, good music.  she faded out of circulation because of pop culture, apparently nobody wants good music anymore, they want rappers singing about drugs, money, their fucking cars, rather then songs that have meaning.  Now, last night i saw a music video by Jewel.  I was a bit surprised so i watched.  Sure enough, she got damn near naked in the video.  She completely reversed her whole self image.  Its sad when someone who used to sing songs with depth, with a meaning behind them, has to throw her naked body around just to make some money in this shitty, SHITTY pop culture bullshit.
To be honest, im digusted with the world, its a dank shit hole filled with moronic people.  Hope you had fun reading my crap, now go out and do something productive.

"event","I've been somewhat avoiding this, but im up early and litterally have nothing to do, so no time like the present.
It all started Saturday, at Carrie's birthday dinner.  She made a comment concerning Win and myself and a thing we both had in common (Thanks carrie...).  My reaction was...well...hardly unsurprising.  I was pissed, everyone knew i was pissed. 
Then i got to reading Win's LJ.  I swear, i must have some desire to torture myself.  
Since both those incidences, i've been doing a lot of thinking.  I was fucked up over what happened to me for a long time, some call it being depressed.  Now, depression is a funny thing.  Its easy to get in, but a huge pain in the ass to get out of it.  Sometimes, when you think you've gotten out, you havn't.  you've just filled yourself with deluded little fucked up thoughts that you aren't depressed anymore.  Im quite happy to say, thats not me.  So, can anyone guess what I did while i was depressed?  its not hard to figure out, alcohol!.  Let me put it in this perspective.  On average (and i did the math on this) week, i used to spend about 50 bucks on booze.  Now, keep in mind, i dont have a job, so where did i get this money?  hell, even im not sure, but i managed.  So 50 bucks equals about 4.5 nights of me reaching my current limit with alcohol.  thats a day over half a week of being drunk each night.  Now this trend continued untill recently, when i just stopped.
And now that im all clean and sober, only questions remain.  
Am i still depressed?  Who knows.  i sure as hell don't, nor do i actually give a shit.  i dont have time to be depressed.  i've got way more important shit to do, then worry to myself about depression.  'The #1 cause of suicide is untreated depression'  as the billboard tells me.  Thats great, guess what?  i'm not suicidal.  If i was, this post wouldn't exist.  Let's face it.  when it comes down to doing what i think i need to do, i dont bullshit around it, if i wanted to kill myself, it'd be long done and over.  so you all dont have to worry about me offing myself, thats much is for sure.
Do i still love her?  ...yes.  As much as i dont want to admit it, i do.  And it fucking pisses me off too.  This is absolute crap!  after the hell i went through concerning her, how the fuck can my goddamned mind still find a way to love her?  doesnt make much sense to me.  It makes even LESS sense when everything in me tells me not to be around her, not to talk to her, basically removing her entirely from my life.  Figure that crap out, then tell me how it works.  God knows i dont understand that shit.  Well...i guess it is possible.  I mean, its not easy to just up and delete someone who holds or held some major role in your life. either way, whatever.
What would happen if we did run into eachother?  This is something i dont want a answer to.  Taking in to account our last encounter, i think things would be far worse then that.  'The corner mouse attacks the cat.'  Why does that come to mind?  Its simple.  You put her and i into some sort of social gathering and we're bound to run into eachother.  Despite my best attempts last time, it still happened, and i handled it exactly the way i thought was best, and in the end, was the best for me.  But you see, i have little tolerance and even less patience.  Last time, it went smoothly.  Next time?  i'll have less tolerance and patience for it.  Put all of that together with a short temper and it makes out to be a bad situation.  Now is it written in stone that it would end badly?  no.  but im not sure i am willing to take the risk that it wouldnt end that way.  I try to avoid conflict if i can.  It's not a matter of me not being the 'bad guy'  nor is it wanting to make liz out to be the bad person either.  its a matter of putting the past where it belongs: out of my goddamn way.
Love, what the fuck?  setting Liz aside, i see basically all my friends having someone they love.  Seems like everyone has a 'significant other' except me.  now, i guess this bothers me.  It suckes, royally sucks being alone.  But i have to take in to concideration my own personal history with relationships, which sorry to say, isnt very good.  Failures come to mind.  In every damn aspect of love i've failed.  oh well.  its well known i dont plan on getting married, or having kids, so why should i even bother with relationships in the first place?  because love blows.  you see, theres three things concerning others of the opposite sex (or same sex or both, if you swing that way) theres love.  theres sex.  and theres love and sex.  Love, in my mind, is constantly re-defined.  It can be the usual bullcrap people do in a relationships (ie. dates, romantic dinners, outtings, etc).  I dont think i need to give a definition of sex, do i?  Now heres the trick.  If i wanted to (note WANTED) i could go out and get laid.  Sure it'd take effort, but i could do it.  But i can't say the same for love.  i cant just go out and find love.  well...i suppose i could, if i werent so jaded.  Am i so goddamned bitter about love that i forsake it?  maybe, who knows.  Its a conflict of interests really.  I want to be loved, i want to love, but i cant.  hypocritical in a way.  again, figure that shit out and let me know what you find.

Moving on.  It's been almost a year since the whole thing started.  and i find myself worse off then i was last year.  this seems to be a recurring trend, and it damn well better not continue, or someone's going to pay.  I guess i could stop ignoring liz, i could let her talk to me.  but i will not, under ANY circumstances start any kind of conversation between the two of us.  If she never talks to me, we never see eachother again, oh well.  hell.  odds are it's whats best for me.  but the fucking voice inside my head tells me i should give it yet another chance, even though she gave up on me without a second thought.  
its now 7:30 in the morning, and...well...im going back to bed, this shit sucks...why did i write this all down?

ugh...whatever"

"event","Woohoo...what a fucking night.  You know, if theres on thing about people i will never understand, its why they dont keep their goddamn mouths shut.  Its funny how one mother fucker sentance out of someone's mouth can keep me awake...well its not really so funny as it is annoying.  To make it worse, that person knew i'd rather not talk about that shit, and yet they said it anyway.  they know full well the bitterness within me about that whole damned situation, hell, i talked with them constantly during it, so they cant say they're ignorant as to the curcumstances.
Further more, someon had the balls to say im not over it.  Maybe i am, maybe im not.  im done with the ordeal, but i suppose 'being over it' is very subjective to each individual's interpretation of my actions and words.  To reitterate myself, and repeat yet again, I dont want to see her...ever.  So, maybe you need clarifacation as to just what this means.  If you're having a party, and she's there, dont even bother to invite me, i wont show up.  If she happens to be in your car while you're driving around and you feel the urge to visit me, don't.  Don't dare say hi to me when you're around here, nothing!  why?  all of it is so completly and utterly unnececary.  'Cant you guys just be friends?'  i've been asked.  my answer: no.  why?  tried it, didn't work, endded up worse off then before.  i have my oppinion of her, of what she did to me, as well as what she did to others.  we all have our own oppinions about everyone, i respect yours weither or not i agree with them, and i damn well expect you'd do the same for me.
I dont care if you talk about her and im there, just refrain from including my name in the same sentance.  More often then not, im not really paying attention to what you're saying anyways, but when my name is borught up, it catches my attention.
more to say, but fuck it, im tired"

Fyi: 
This is the deepest level of hell, where the fallen angel Satan himself resides. His wings flap eternally, producing chilling cold winds that freeze the thick ice found in Cocytus. The three faces of Satan, black, red, and yellow, can be seen with mouths gushing bloody foam and eyes forever weeping, as they chew on the three traitors, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. This place is furthest removed from the source of all light and warmth. Sinners here are frozen deep in the ice, faces out, eyes and mouths frozen shut. Traitors against God, country, family, and benefactors lament their sins in this frigid pit of despair."

"event","Bleh, goddamned retarded people.  seriously, its a sad fact that 90 percent of the population of the world isnt smarter then a box of rocks.  just as an example, a situtation im in.  My friend Marcus constantly talks about how much ass he can kick, sayin he's a 'hella good scrapper' and shit.  so guess what he does, he goes and pisses off this little skinny kid and they get into a fight.  Marcus got his ass absolutly handed to him, then he comes to me askin to back him up.
i laughed in his face.  he finally realized that his delluded dreams were wrong, and he can't infact fight.  basically i told Marcus its his problem, not mine.  even though i've known marcus for  years now, i still wont get his back in shit like that.  why?  cuz im not fucking stupid, im not going to involve myself in a fight unless a few things happen first.
the first being that kid threatens him.  When someone threatens or anything further then that, then it becomes my problem, as Evan can tell you all.  i dont take kindly to threats on myself, i frown upon threats made against my friends even more.  now im not going to boast that i can whoop anyone's ass, hell...i doubt i could take someone my own size, but thats not the point.  sure i might get my ass kicked, i'll prolly bleed, and will hurt.  but i anit gunna be the only one hurting, that fucker who came at me will hurt too.  and its not that i look for fights, hell, i avoid them like the goddamn plague, why?  mostly cuz i dont wanna get all fucked up, it just anit no fun, but when this first condition is met, then i get involved.
the second condition is if the kid actually goes after Marcus.  like the last one, this applies to all my friends.  its fine if they make their peace, but if something were to happen to marcus afterwords, then it's on.  honestly, i guess im a little over protective, but whatever.  i just hate seein my friends gettin fucked with.
as for other 'events' lets just say...that they will be delt with.  

moving on...

Old friend called me today while i was at work.  hadn't talked with her in...3 years.  she asked the usual bullshit, 'havn't talked to you in forver, what's new?' questions.  But after our conversation, i dont think she was exactly happy.
heres the conversation.
her: Sam broke up with me.
me: why? (me being playing dumb, she used him and fucked with him soooooooooo much, we all knew it)
her: i don't know, he just called me up last weekend and said 'sorry, it's over'
me: could it be because...you used him?
her: i wasnt using him!
me: bull!  you know damn well you used him.  where'd you get your car?  who paid for your school?  did he do those things because he wanted to?  NO! he did it because YOU asked him to!
her: well...
me: you know its true, dont deny it. (i started laughing)
then she said she had to go, big shock...
Brings me a great thought.  one of the MANY benefits of not having a girlfriend is not spending my goddamned money.  its even better since i dont have any.  seriously though, what is the point to having a girlfriend?  love?  sex?  sex you can get, love?  -pukes- who needs it?  love, marrige, both words invented by a woman.  what for?  to snare men into their wicked little games, spend our money, ruin our lives.  50% of all marriges end in divorce these days ATLEAST.  and what happens in a divorce with no prenup?  woman gets half of the shit.  prenups were invent by men to protect ourselves from women, lets face it.
heres something someone sent me, and it sums it allllllllllllllllll up

The mathmatical equasion:
 Time = Money
 Women = Money + Time
 Since Time = Money, that means Money^2
 So:  Women = Money^2
 Money is the root of all evil so:
 Women = \/--Money^2 
 So, Women = Evil

yup, thats says it all"

"event","Was talking with a friend last night, and she refered to my last 2 LJ posts.  she asked me 'what the hell happened?'.  so i told her the great story.  now, i've known this girl for the better part of 8 years or so and in that time she's never heard or seen of my spiteful side.
i think she was disgusted with what i had to say concerning Liz.  she knows what happened between us since before last weekend, so its not like she doesnt know the circumstances under which my actions were guided last weekend.  But she is a she, there in lies part of the problem.  from my understanding, all women support one-another, even if they dont know eachother, and they support eachother only until one of them fucks over the other, then its all fair game.  this friend of mine said and i quote: 'Dan, come on!  this isn't like you!  she clearly wanted to talk to you last weekend.  i bet she wants to try to work things out between you two.  she used to be one of your best friends right?  quit being pig-headed and talk with her, i KNOW you have something you want to say to her.'
She was right, it isnt like me just to not talk with someone, cuz you know...i could have just blown up in liz's face, said exactly what was on my mind, and oh yes, there is a lot i could say to her.  but what would that accomplish?  nothing.  Liz would just continue to fuck over damn near everyone she meets, hell, it's happening as i type this.  so why does she do it?  heh heh...i have a answer...but im not going to say it here.  and suppose she did want to work things out.  suppose she did want to still be my friend.  well, to fuckin bad, not my problem anymore.  let me make this perfectly clear to all of you.  i want nothing more to do with her!  is that so goddamned complicated to understand?  she fucked me over one too many times.  it stuns me that she has friends at her school, STUNS me.  i mean, who here in seattle has she fucked with?  umm...all of us?  and yet most of you all still pick up the phone when she calls, go on stupid little trips to movies or starbucks crap when she asks you to, invite her to parties you're holding.  know what that says?  'Oh, liz, you can fuck me over as much as you want with no consequences, so go right ahead, here let me bend over for you'
quit being goddamn pussies and just tell her to shut the fuck up and walk away, its honestly not that hard.  she needs to know that there are consequences to her retarded mind games.  the more you forgive her, the cockier she gets and the worse it'll all get, DUH!
makes me wanna puke seeing her just bend some of you to her will, letting her take advantage of you.

bah, goddamn pussies!"

"event","It was a toss up for a title for this post.  'Holy shit!  your ass is on fire!  weak!' was my first thought, however i began to think more about what i had to say, and the title 'Random Morality' seems to be more fitting.
As i thought, last night proved to be quite eventfull, it was...very unexpected.  it became clear to me very quickly as to why i had been avoiding this entire ordeal.  the truth be told, my breif conversation with Liz...well more as to what i had to say, it was all very true.  i literally have nothing to say to her, at all, ever.  i dont know exactly why that is so hard for her to grasp, but its no longer my problem.  it would seem that particular chapter is now closed for good...well...atleast i seem to think it is.  but for some reason closed chapters in my life seem to reiterate themselves.  now, an interesting question was purposed to me last night, after the little...incident.  'Dan,' she said.  'Don't you feel bad?'  no.  no, i really dont feel bad at all.  i mean, it was very goddamn clear to everyone there that i was avoiding her, and i was doing so for good reason, to spare anyone else who felt the need to poke their noses in my shit to repercussions of what was going to happen when liz finally cought me.  to be honest, i dont give a shit if what happened hurt her, made her mad, or anything.  cuz you see, i loooooooong ago moved past trying to bring up that subject with her, it just doesnt happen with me anymore.  i am far more comfortable in thinking that it never existed, that her and i never happened.  why?  cuz i dont care about it anymore.  i dont know how the hell she still can, it completly mystifies me.  
More broadly, last night was just plain great.  i felt so great after everything had transpired, i felt like a huge weight had been lifted.  while i could have gone the rest of my life without ever seeing her again, im just as happy with the end results of not having my original desires.  But, a question i guess i would have is 'what did she expect?'  and to me thats a valid one, i mean...our last parting wasn't exactly on great terms, did she think it'd magically repair itself?  worng!  did she think the bitterness i have (note have, not had) would just go away?  clearly it hasnt, but it is now.  i think it'd be safe to say that i wont be seeing, or hearing of/from her again, ever.  now this does bother me, some what.  i mean we used (not used, not are) good friends, is it wrong of me to just let it fade away?  meh.  i dont think so.  after all that happened, the hurt, the pain, it feels very liberating to in some way return the oh so wonderful feelings i felt.  its safe to say that long before this recent event opur friendship was long gone to shit, hell, it was long before that.  but you know?  i have other friends, i've had older, and longer friends then she, i've even dated a few, never with this kind of result.  does this make liz a bad person?  nah, not at all.  'Every day is an adventure' according to Evan and Carey, the same can be said about people.  
now the real shock for me is my self control last night.  did i have more to say to her?  oh hell yes i did, i had plenty that i could have voiced to her, some of which would not have been nearly as plesent as what i did say, or lack there of for that matter.  why didnt i scream at her?  why didnt i let my temper get the best of me?  why didnt i 'remove' her from my way when she blocked me?  i have no answer.  it could have been the small limit of alcohol i took, but such things dont really affect me in that way.  had i been absolutly trashed, i would have just not said anything to her, despite her best actions to make me, that has been my expirence with alcohol and such situations.  so what was it that stayed my rage?  more likely it was the friendship and respect i have for Sarah, our host.  i did not want her to feel the wrath of the hotel manager because of my actions, nor did i want to create a scene and ruin her party for her and the others who were there.  i think it stunned more then just me, i got the impression that many others who know me as well as they do were also quite surprised at my restraint.  but maybe it was just me.  
There were other things that happened last night.  Liz's friend, Jessica (or something like that, i heard her called by several different names) was definitly...and eye opening expirence.  she seemed nice, very friendly and open about what she wanted.  also i think she wanted something of me that i was not willing to give.  being as they are roommates at their school, and for some reason i apparently have some respect for liz, i wouldnt do that to her, liz, i mean.  but you know, it is nice to feel wanted, very nice.  but also somehow embarassing, but none the less, its still a great feeling.  had it been a different situation, then your damn right i would have done what i wanted, or maybe if i had taken more drinks.  but cant go back on it now, nor would i if given the chance. 
so, at the end of all this, where does it leave me?  where does it leave liz?  for me, it leaves me feeling finally free, and skeleton out of the closet so to speak.  i havnt felt this good in almost two years, and im loving every goddamn fucking second of it.  as for liz, dont know, cant say i really care either, she's as much a part of my life as crack is, i see it every once in ahwile, but i'll never go near it or touch it.  and for once, im fine with that.  for once, im happy.

with no regrets, the best way to live.

"event","In the world of shitty tv, boring computer games, i have really only one thing left, driving around aimlessly
But even that has been taken from me.  why?  every where i look i see stupid fucking people with signs, stickers, etc on their car all relating to Operation Iraqi Freedom aka bomb the shit out of them.
lets be honest folks.  does it give you some sort of patriotic sense of joy to proudly display your person feelings about this war?  if it does?  you're still a moron and i'll tell you why.
first of all, protesting that we should go into iraq is absolutly fucking stupid.  why?  watch the news, read the papers...you're too fucking late assholes.  second of all, what is really accomplished by putting those signs in your windows?  well they block your vision, making you all the more likely for you to cause an accident (not that you all are exactly briliant drivers anyways, so lets make you even more stupid while driving a 1 ton piece of steel with fuel in it...morons).  also, does putting these ever-so-eye-catching/annoying signs do ANYTHING WHAT SO FUCKING EVER TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE GODDAMNED WAR????  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  it accomplishes nothing, NOTHING!  save only pissing people like me off.  so fuck you!  you think that by putting a sign in your car window will suddenly stop the war?  i can see Bush's statement now: 'oh fuck!  Rick Basil put a sign saying to not attack iraq!  STOP THE WAR!!!'  like that'll ever happen retards.
my advice? quit being stupid, burn your damn signs, go the fucking speed limit, and get the fuck outta my goddamn way assholes!"

"event","you remember back when we were kids?  and you were home sick from like 4th grade?  and all that was on TV was bullshit soap operas, talk shows, and shows that were on when our great grand parents were babies?
well, seems as i dont have a job, it sit...all fucking day long and watch tv.  aside from Maury always, ALWAYS doing the 'who'se my fuckin ugly, shit hole, baby's father cuz im a dumb whore' shows, i must say day time tv has vastly outclassed primetime.  i mean look at the dull, lifeless, pointless, puke-inducing trash thats on prime time tv.  i'll give you one example.  American (Fucking) Idle.  just the name alone pisses me off.  American Idle.  what the fuck is that shit.  how in the fuck is this no talent ass-clown supposed to be an idle?  an idle to who?  who in their right goddamn mind would make one of these fools their idle?  sure as hell not me.  god, i dont even have to see the tv to known when this, the crappiest of all tv shows i have EVER seen, is on.  i can hear the goddamned music to it, and right away i scrounge for my remote and cancel that peice of shit show.  
I mean, it was fine...for about 1 episode...the first season, but now?  it makes me want to punch their goddamned teeth out.
reality television can lick my testicles.  these asshole network heads think of shtty ideas, spend billions on making a show that depicts a bunch of losers betraying eachother, picking wives/husbands, lieing, cheating, and all around being the sterotypical asshole american.  and people wonder why everyone hates us!  look at the people we put on these shows, and other countries are watching this shit?!?  no wonder everyone just assumes we're know-it-all pricks.  Big Brother, Survivor, American Idle, Joe Millionare, The Mole, all of them are such a dull attempt at hooking us into the hype that is the shithole reality television crap.
holy fucking goddamned, motherfucking, ass-licking, cock-sucking, donkey-boning, CRAP im sick of ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL this crap.  look, its simple, stop watching this crap and it'll go away, then maybe we can get some good shit to watch every hour instead of once a week.

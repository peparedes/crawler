"event","So lately things have been good.  I've been spending too much money and now I need to hold off and save.  I'm supposed to go to Florida sometime at the end of the summer with Ash to stay at her grandmas house and I know even though I don't have to pay for a hotel, I still have to pay for the tickets, food, and I really want to go to Ikea while I'm there.  Russ wants to go on a trip to Boston sometime this summer too.  Neither of us has been to the city and we're hoping to have a blast checking it out.  Leah wants to go to the Renaissance Faire in August and I need to buy a costume because we all agreed to dress up.  I also need to get both of my cats declawed because they've ruined my couches and some of my chairs.  I'm afraid of how much it's going to cost and also how much it might change their personalities.  They're 4 and 3 years old.  Hopefully they adapt well.  :/
Anyway it's going to be a lot of money to do all of these things and I've been spending waaaaay too much.  I've got to put a kabash on it.  There are just sooooo many things to buy!  hahaha.

So Summer has been great.  I've been outside a lot more this year.  Going to the beach and bike riding.  It's been beautiful aside from the rain spell we had for a while there.  Also!  My brother Joey came home and I got to spend a few days with him.  I really missed him and it was really hard to see him leave.  I pray he will be safe on his 6th tour to Iraq.  <3"

"event","So My birthday was amazing.  Day before, my boss bought me a cake that said ""Happy Birthday Brat"" on it lol.  Later that night 12 of my friends and I went out to Ichiban for dinner and it was so much fun and delicious!  They sang happy birthday to me in Japanese and it was so cute!  Some of us went out and had a good time at the bars afterword.  On the day of, Russ and I spent the whole day together.  First we went to Stella's for breakfast and that was fun because I LOVE their french toast.  Then he took me to the mall and gave me my present.  He bought me new speakers for my car and a new deck so I can listen to my Ipod in my car now.  It was awesome.  I brought my car there to get it installed and Russ and I went apple picking for the rest of the day.  I love him and I've never had a nicer birthday.  

Then a twist of events...

So the day after I woke up sicker than shit!  I went to work Monday sick and Tuesday.  After having a rough day at work on Tuesday (yesterday), I got into a terrible car accident.  I was on West Genessee making a left hand turn onto Rt 5.  I had a green arrow and I was the second car in the lane making the turn.  I never saw the lady run through two intersections before running this red light, hitting my car head on.  My car was spun more than 360 degrees in the intersection.  The air bags deployed and broke my nose.  When the car stopped I realized I was still screaming and that the airbags left a thick white powder in the air.  I freaked out and ran out of the car to the side of the road.  I also realized my nose was gushing and my knee was in pain.  Some thing cut my knee in the car and it was sore.  The old woman who ran the red light was not getting out of the car and complained about pain.  It turns out she didn't have a scratch on her and she was actually on Lortab, which is a serious pain medication which can impair your judgment on reality including her ability to drive.  She shouldn't have been driving in the first place.  She was like 65.  Fuck.

I took an ambulance to Upstate hospital and got X-rays.  I'm ok.  I might have a torn ligament in my knee and my nose is straight so I didn't need it to get set.  Today I woke up feeling sore everywhere and I've been on the phone all morning talking to my insurance agency.  I had to take today off and now I see why.  Everything hurts.  Uggg.  I can't wait to see how things unfold."

"event","A little over two weeks until my birthday.  I'll be 24 years old.  I'm actually content with my age.  For a while I was really dreading it.  I've come to realize that I'm actually in a decent place in my life.  No, I'm not married and don't have kids.  But I don't want those things for a while.  Getting engaged would be sweet but that's obvious haha.  I reeeeeally don't want children until I'm like 30.  Hahaha!  I have a job that pays more than my bills, friends that care about me, a man that loves me more than life itself, an apartment that looks the way I like, and more importantly I'm content with myself because I can honestly say that I've tried.

My job is going well.  Panera is a fun place to work.  I can't wait until December when I get my week of vacation.  I get another week in May.  I met my best friend there.  Her name is Ashley and she's the caterer.  I've met a lot of other awesome people there too.  There really isn't anyone I don't get along with there.  Being a manager here is sooo much different than at Bruegger's.  I do a lot more paperwork and make sure others are doing the job correctly.  At Bruegger's I felt like another worker.  There weren't enough people to actually have  a manager.  So anyway, I've been playing the ""yes man"" game and it's working out for me.  I used to feel depressed/bored because I didn't have anything to do outside of work for a while.  I've had plans pretty much constantly since I started saying yes to people more often.  I'm working on my social anxiety and it's getting better for sure.  I'm a lot happier.  Seriously.  I get out of work at 11pm on Friday and Ashley, Brittany, Russ and I are heading to the casino for a night of shenanigans.  I have a lot to look forward to.

Russ and I are doing amazingly.  I love this guy more than anything in the world.  We are for each other.  We have our ups and downs but at the end of the day I will always love him and he me.  

Tonight I feel great.  I'm listening to some great music and I just finished some decorating for the autumn season.  Anyone who knows me, knows I get so excited for autumn festivities.  I got Bella and Murmur little costumes so I can horrify them and take their pictures haha.  I'm going apple picking next weekend with some family and friends.  I will take tons of pictures.  Speaking of taking pictures, soon it will be the perfect time of the season to take graveyard pictures.  WEEE!  I feel so free during autumn.  I don't know why I feel a sense of relief.  

Oh!  Minus the Bear is playing in Syracuse on November 17th.  Anyone care to join?  <3"

"event","So camping this year was fun and I look forward to next year.  It was such a beautiful time.  Russ and I went hiking a few times, cooked over the fire, read ghost stories, and took long drives in the middle of nowhere where we found an orchard with amazing fruit and took cute pictures at the beach.  God I love him.  I'm fairly certain we'll be together for the rest of our lives.  Last week he asked me what I will wear at our wedding.  Like what kind of dress and the style etc.  How stinking cute!  :)  I think I want to get married in Hawaii and have a few close friends and family come.  I don't care about getting married in some huge ugly old church.  I want to get married on the beach and have a vacation with my lover right there.  Le sigh...  hahaha I'm such a dork.

Ashley's birthday was yesterday and I took her out the weekend before for some drinks with some of the ladies.  When I got to work on Monday, I brought orange Gerber daisies, a huge embarrassing ice cream cake, and then had Jay sang over the mic and announce it was her birthday.  How embarrassing!  People sang and clapped while she sat on her break.  hahaha.  I'm glad I met her.  She's such a great person and I hope I made her birthday better in some way.  Today I'm getting my oil changed and going to the fair with Ash, Brit, Sam, and Julia.  I'm so glad I've met some amazing friends recently.  I felt alone for a little while mostly because Alisha and I pretty much never talk anymore and I didn't really know anyone in Baldwinsville.  I used to feel like if I didn't invite myself to come hang out with people it would never happen.  I think things have flip-flopped and I'm happy.  I still miss Alisha but I think she's happy anyway and that's all I could hope for.

My Sallie Mae loan is more than 3/4 paid off.  I can't believe it's becoming Autumn already!  Fuck yeah!  :D"

"event","So the other day I was walking through the swinging door at work and I jammed my finger on it.  No big deal right?  Wrong.  At first I thought, ""Oh shit, I broke it?"".  But then I look and it's bleeding.  A lot.  So I go directly to the bathroom to look at it.  I look under my finger nail and it's not connected to my finger!  It's barely on by the cuticle and base of the nail.  So about 80% of my nail is off of my finger.  Fucking great.  So now I call the doctor and they tell me that my nail will fall off and MOST LIKELY grow back!  Are you fucking serious!?  How disgusting.  :(  This weird shit always happens to me.  lol  You would have thought it would have hurt more considering how the idea of that makes my skin crawl.  It wasn't that bad.  haha.
So I'm getting brilliant blue contacts as soon as I get my insurance cards in the mail.  I'm stoked.  Freshlook finally made vibrant contacts for people with astigmatisms.  YAY!  My eyes are already blue but I feel like they used to look so much more blue before.  This will be fun anyway and I'm sick of my glasses.  Everyone and their mother has black framed glasses.  TRENNNNNDYYYYYY.  
On another note.  I just got a few days off for camping this year approved!  Hooray.  I'm also going to Bouckville this year again for the antique festival with my mom.  I hope I find some fun things to accessorize the apartment.  Although I think it's looking pretty awesome so far.  I love decorating.  :)  
I'm waiting for my hair to grow long again.  I really miss my hair.  It's about an inch past shoulder length or so now.  I had fun while it was short but I think it's most flattering on me when it's longer.  I honestly contemplated getting extensions but I wouldn't want to ruin my hair.  Le sigh.  How do the celebrities do it?  haha.  
On an accomplishing note, I will have my Sally Mae loan paid off by December of this year.  Go me!  I've been paying the extra so I can be done with it.  I still have Direct Loans to figure out but I can def manage that.  I'm making more money now but instead of living it up I've been paying the bills.  When December comes I will finally have extra money to play with.  Not that I live THAT tightly now though.  I'm almost 24 with no kids and my boyfriend and I both have jobs and no mortgage."

"event","Started going to the gym yesterday.  YAY!  Really getting into getting in shape.  I'm feeling better about myself already.  I got this weekend off because with the new store opening I won't have weekends off for a while.  Met the other two Assistants Managers.  They are awesome!  Bobby is a big guy, really funny, seems to like me.  :)  Jason is really funny, looks like Abercrombie material but I think it's a facade.  :-P  I did a few interviews with them and it got me pumped to start.  I also met my GM last week and he seems pretty cool.  Somewhat hard to read but that's because he doesn't talk much.  I'll figure him out soon enough.  My training officially ends this Tuesday and then I start at the new store on the 27th.  I was getting nervous but I'm feeling more confident now that I know the other managers.  

Mom is coming up this weekend and I'm decorating the apartment and making lasagna with her.  yum yum.  :]  Mom has been looking for someone to go on dates with on a dating website.  I'm happy she's at least open to THAT!  I just don't ever want to see her be lonely.  Leah got a job working full time and apparently started seeing someone.  Haha life seems to be looking up for everyone.  

Leash, I finally started reading the tenth circle.  It seems promising so far!  Thanks for the recommend.  :]"

It's such an overwhelming feeling to be this much in love.  You've been my rock and my everything.  You've been there for me through thick and thin.  You constantly shower me with unconditional love and you always understand my shortcomings without criticism.  Through my worst and my best.  I know that I don't need to try to impress you.  I can just be myself and I know you love me for me.  You have no idea how much you mean to me.  I know that I would be completely lost without you.  I'm dangerously in love you and I'm so incredibly excited to be spending the rest of my life with you.  I know we will babe.  I will never stop loving you.  Happy birthday my love.

Forever yours,

Emma"

"event","I just found out what cafe I'm going to after my training is over.  I thought I was going to go to the Cicero cafe.  I wasn't really excited about it because it's a smaller cafe and they get less management.  I don't want to HAVE to run a tight shift.  It also means there would be more of the workload put on me.  No big deal though.  I'm used to it.

ANYWAY!

Out of the other 4 MITs, they picked me to go to the new cafe in Camilus.  It's being built now as I write.  Everything is going to be brand spankin' new and clean!  I'm fucking stoked!  It's a big deal to have been picked over everyone else.  It means they think I can handle it and that's awesome.  It's only a 20 min drive to work which is no change from here for the most part.  I'm so excited!

On another note, our apartment looks hot!  I will post pics soon!  I'm in love with it.  One last thing.  I just bought this lumbar back massager thing from Brookstone and spent too much money but I'm so excited to use it!"

I fucking love my new apartment.  We have most of our new furniture and everything looks awesome.  I'm not very unpacked but we're managing haha.  I'm surprised how much bigger our apartment is now.  It's a lot noisier of a place but I'm ok with that.  Bella and Murmur LOVE it here.  They're being so lovie dovie.  :)  I love my new job.  It's not half as stressful as my old one.  I've learned so much so far.  I met some of the other MITs (Managers In Training) yesterday.  Most of them are really friendly and genuinely happy people to be around.  I think I'm the youngest one but I think that's pretty awesome that I'm doing as well as I am at my age with out a college degree.  Money is much better but school loans are kicking in again soon.  Blah blah blah.  I can't wait to start going back to school.  :)  I have to work the taste of Syracuse on Saturday (4-midnight) but I'm actually somewhat excited.  It's supposed to be really nice out and I think it will be a fun experience.  On a random note, I think if I ever have a problem with my car (knock on wood) I'm going to trade it in and lease something hot.  I love my car but it would be nice to have something sexy hahaha.  Something else random, this year Russ and I are talking about going on a vacation together.  I'm so excited.  Probably in the spring.  Not sure where yet.  Maybe California or Florida.  I honestly don't care as long as we leave NY.  Last random statement, I have been vegetarian for about two months.  Go me.  :)"

"event","So far I have a week at my new job under my belt.  I had to work 3 nights for baking evaluation.  At Panera they do the baking at night so people like me will pretty much never have to during the day.  I may have to spot bake a few things but that won't happen very often.  ANYWAY it was rough!  I had to work 10pm until 6am.  I'm so glad I never have to do that again haha.  I'll be training for about 7 more weeks.  It's nice to have the time to really get to know everything I'll need to know.  Rather than, when I worked at Brueggz, they just sort of threw me into it and I learned as I went.  They would be angry when there was something I was never taught.  I hate you Brueggz lol.

My cousin Christopher and Lizzie found me on facebook.  I'm so happy to get in touch with more of my family from my dad's side.  I used to hang out with Chris like every weekend when I was a little girl.  It makes me feel bad that I don't see that side of my family anymore.  I miss my Gramma.  Lizzie says none of the family gets together since Grampa passed away.  That was ten years ago!  I don't care to see my dad but I really do want to see Gramma.  Le sigh.  I'm such a procrastinator.  I'm anxious about the uncomfortable.  I'm so anxious about so many things.

Russ is my favorite person in the world.  I've fallen more and more for him when I didn't think I could fall anymore.  He is definitely my puzzle piece and other half.  I'm sure we'll be together forever.  I don't care if that sounds immature and corny.  It's how I truly feel.  And I'm just so happy we have each other.  <3"

I've been taking vitamins, drinking the right amount of milk and water, and even sleeping for eight hours every night.  I don't even feel healthier.  THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO!  I'M SO F***ING BORED!  Luckily I start my new job on Wednesday!  Orientation ew!  I only have 5 hours of that but get paid for a full day haha (salary bitchhhhhhhhhhh) it'll be noon to 5ish.  I know that sounds stupid but I had to make sure I worked every minute of my fifty hours at Bruegz.

We move back to Liverpool in a little over two weeks.  I'm so excited about the move.  I'm going to live about a mile from Leah so I can help her out much easier.  We're upgrading to a nicer apartment, a balcony, and a second bedroom.  This apartment will have central air.  Before I got fired we were talking about upgrading our furniture.  So once I start getting a paycheck again we're planning on going in on halfs on a brand new coffee table and side table, which are black and modern looking. Russ is buying a 52"" flat tv and we're going in on halfs for the entertainment stand, which is also black.  I'm buying a really nice kitchen table and chairs.  The table and chairs are at the height that make your feet dangle.  I love it so much!  We love our couches but hate the color of them so we're thinking slip covers.  I used to have 2k saved for this stuff and I was ready to buy the new furniture when I was fired.  So now I paid Russ for all of the bills (including the new deposit and rent for the new apartment) and paid my car payment and insurance until July and I have about 400 left in the bank.  It makes me sad but I landed on my feet with a higher paying job.  The money should replenish itself in no time.  le sigh.

"event","So yesterday afternoon Charlie from Panera called me and offered me the position of Assistant Manager.  He said we'll sit down today and talk about my salary and do the last step which is the background check.  SO I'M PRETTY SURE I GOT THE JOB!  But we just need to make sure my background check is clean... which I'm pretty sure all the stupid shit I did when I was a kid was dismissed and not on my permanent record.  It was ACDed.  And that means if you're good for six months it's like you never did it.  I've learned a lot from making those mistakes and I'm not ashamed of anything.  *crosses fingers*  

ANYWAY.  I was making about 26,000 a year at my old job.  I'm going to ask for 28,500 from this one.  This job is salary and not hourly but I did figure it out that I was making about 10.25 hourly at the old one.  So this would be like asking for 11.00 an hour.  I don't think that's unheard of.  But we'll see.  I suppose I ought to get ready.  I have to wear long sleeves because I'm not talking about the tattoo until I absolutely have to.  LOL.  God I'm a piece of work.  Wish me luck.  :]"

It's a salaried position about 45-50 hrs a week.  Benefits!  They have about 3 assistant managers per store.  So that means a lot less responsibilities.  Hopefully a pay increase but I didn't ask.  Either way it's better than being unemployed.  I'll know by the end of the week.  :)"

I thought about telling her to suck a fart out of my ass and quitting.  This morning I go in to work and I get fired for applying to other jobs.  Apparently I was sabotaging the moral of the other workings and advertising it.  LOL.  That's obviously not a legitimate reason to fire someone.  I mean for God's sake I've never done anything wrong there.  Never even been written up or warned!  I'm happy.  I never have to wake up that early again.  So I applied for unemployment as soon as I got home and I have another interview at Panera on Monday.  I applied at a few more jobs online too.  I might not get the job so I'm definitely still looking.  I really want to be done with food.  Although, I've heard the pay is great at Panera.  Pray for me.  I have enough money in the bank to pay for my bills for the next two months.  I'm seething with anger because I wish I would have quit.  It's almost embarrassing that I was fired for something so silly.  I applied at other jobs because Sheryl is a psychopath.  They fire me?

On another note.  Panera Bread is hiring in North Syracuse for an assistant and must have seen my application from a while back and called me asking for a phone interview.  I think I'll call them back tomorrow.  It can't hurt to have options even though I really don't want to work with food anymore.  And besides, maybe Evonne hated me.

Poor Russ is getting laid off as of March 31st.  I hope he can land on his feet.  Shane (my old house mate) has been out of a job for over six months.  Though, Russ does have a college degree to land on his feet.  I'm genuinely not worried.  I know we'll figure it out like we always do.  It might be hard for a while but it too shall pass.  I'm excited to be working full time and going to school nights at Phillip's soon.  My braces come off in a little less than three weeks.  

Russ and I are doing well.  I'm happy where we are and I don't need things to go any faster.  I like that I'm not the girl who sits there waiting for the day he will propose.  Sure, if we stay on this path it's on the way, but I'm 23 years old and I haven't done the things I need to do to make myself completely happy.  I'm learning now that it's ok to be selfish.  A little bit.  I don't want to stand there with my hand on my ass waiting for him to be mr. right.  What will be, will be.  I love him and he is mine and I am his and that's all I really know.  

My cat, Bella, has become such a loving cat these past 6 months.  I think she's relaxed quite a bit and she's so loving now.  She used to hiss when she was held when we lived in the old house, though I think it had a lot to do with what she was surrounded with.  She lets me hold her for short periods of time, lays next to me when I read, and comes to me when I call her.  That's all I could really ask for in a cat.  She loves me and it's wonderful to see that she has relaxed quite a bit.  

I finished Twilight after the third day of reading it.  I'm glad I chose not to see the movie.  It's so amazing so far and I can't wait to buy the next.  Some thing happened tonight that made me chuckle.  I was so worked up toward the end of the book and started to cry.  Bella, my cat, jumped up on the couch and yelled at me and made me laugh uncontrollably.  She got right in my face and meowed so loudyly it scared me and then she licked my face.  :]

"event","It's official.  I'm moving to Taft road Bruegger's.  That store is so dingy and unorganized.  I'm not really that excited but Sheryl needs an assistant ASAP and I worked well with her when I went over to help a few months back.  The new manager at my store in Liverpool is retarded.  I'm not saying all southerners are stupid.. BUT GAWD... way to break the mold.  Ugg.  I miss Jeff already.  I've had offers from Papa Johns and Byrne Dairy to be an assistant manager there but can you believe they won't pay me more that Bruegger's will?  I didn't think it was possible to be paid this low.  LOL.  Fucking economy.  I can't complain, at least I do have a decent paying job with such a deficit in our country.  That's more than some can say right now.  SOOOOOO many people are unemployed.  
Well I got a heads up that Panera Bread is hiring for an assistant for 33k a year and since I just bought a printer I think I'm going to print up my resume and give it a try.  I'm bored of this company and there's nothing but drama in it.  It just reminds me when Koryn switched stores how much people wouldn't stop texting her telling her everything little thing Jeff or I (half the time didn't even say) did or said.  The company really is just pathetically immature.  Blah blah.  Tonight is Russ' and my date night.  Things haven't been better.  I'm so glad we're ok now.  <3"

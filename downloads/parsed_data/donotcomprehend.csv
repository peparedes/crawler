We have decided to try to get to the EGG Facility. Perhaps Sera can get God's attention. Perhaps she can change God's mind.

"event","The Junkyard isn't like most worlds, though the differences won't necessarily be noticeable to everyone who goes there. However, I strongly advise anyone planning on visiting Gale to read this post first, to make sure it <i>doesn't</I> affect your character.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for Length, and Spoilers"">
<b>What is the Junkyard?</b>

The Junkyard is actually an extremely sophisticated battle simulation program, and the people who live there are computer-generated soldiers. The purpose of the Junkyard is to determine the best methods, skills, etc. for war, I believe the idea was that once that was determined through the simulation, that that program would be imported into real people, to turn them into super soldiers.

Therefore, the Junkyard is a place of constant battle. There are compounds scattered through the location, filled with soldiers who can turn into bloodthirsty, cannibalistic demons who <i>will</i> rip your throat out. Outside of the compounds, roving bands of individual soldiers, known as rookies, will try to eat you. They're especially hungry. Everyone in the Junkyard is an excellent fighter, skilled in multiple weapons and modes of battle. 

These people are also actually real people's data, imported into the program and wiped of all memories of their former lives - in a sense, they are real people. Slowly, now that the demon atma has been added to the program, these people are beginning to recall their former lives.

However, the entire Junkyard is also unreal, composed completely of data in a computer bank. <i>Anyone who enters the Junkyard through any worldhopping method is also turned into data for the length of time they are there.</i>

It constantly rains in the Junkyard, and the rain is also composed of data. The rain is literally the data being imported into the program by people in the real world, as they manipulate and make changes to the program.

<b>What does this mean?</b>

This means that characters who are skilled hackers - and I mean, not just good, I mean <i>fantastic</i> such that they can hack literally by the power of thought - can manipulate the fabric of the Junkyard. These people are referred to as Cyber Shaman.

<b>What the heck? How does that work?</b>

Anyone who has this ability, can change the Junkyard to suit their desires - in certain, limited ways. If they go too far with this, the Junkyard's security settings will intervene, Angel will get PMS, and your character will likely be ejected and wake up in their own world with a bad headache. If they're lucky.

Such characters can create their own compound in an unneeded part of the world to their exact specifications, for example. They could make small changes to an existing structure within the Junkyard. They <i>may</i> be able to calm a maddened demon who is trying to eat them.

They <b>cannot</b>:
- Reduce an existing compound to rubble or change it in a significant way.
- Actually control the actions or minds of anyone within the Junkyard.
- Read minds.
- Enter the Karma Temple without getting their asses kicked.
- Stop the rain.
- Enter Nirvana.
- Reverse madness that has become too advanced.
- Take over the Junkyard and rule it with an iron fist.
- Do any of this subconsciously, or without meaning to

Your character will need to figure out that they can manipulate the Junkyard, and then do it <i>consciously</i>. If you're not sure what your character can do, ask! 

<b>So what if my character sucks with computers?</b>

To anyone who isn't a Cyber Shaman, the Junkyard will seem like a very strange, drab, dangerous place where it always rains. They likely will never notice that it's not real. Characters from the Junkyard who worldhop out will become real people not composed of data in any way. 

<i>No one's abilities or physical properties will change in any way, regardless of whether they are in or out of the Junkyard.</i> Only Cyber Shaman can perceive a difference.

Please feel free to discuss this or ask me questions in this post."

"event","Gale's finger still felt odd without the Tag ring on it, but he was starting to get used to accessing the ATM to get money, and purchasing from vendors that were actual people rather than simply rooms full of equipment.

The underground complex that comprised the resistance's stronghold wasn't unlike the Embryon base. The only difference was that it was filled with old men and women and children, as well as able-bodied fighters. Also strange was that the fighters were humans. Humans who looked at the Embryon with open suspicion and fear, obviously terrified that they would turn on them and devour them.

Considering the stories that filtered through from the warfront, Gale couldn't blame them for their fear. It was inconvenient, however.

He could feel their eyes on him as he entered the Karma Terminal and logged into the community. If he had timed this correctly, Michael should arrive in the Terminal, and thus not frighten anyone by a sudden appearance. At least Michael was human."

[Varin gasps out his last breaths, but he's not dead yet] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"">Don't call me... Don't call me by that name. I am a colonel... I am Colonel Beck.</span>

"event","[All five of the Embryon leaders are standing in the conference room of a brand new above-ground base. The previous one has been abandoned since it was found and breached by the Solids. Everyone's attention is on Gale, who looks particularly solemn.]

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">I have bad news. It seems that Vishundha has been overrun</span>.<lj-cut text=""Cut for Length"">

[Cielo reacts with shock] <span style=""color: rgb(0, 204, 255);"">You said da Wolves would last longer dan dat!</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Though it defies probability, the fact is undeniable. And to make matters worse, the remaining members of Solids have been forcibly enlisted by the Brutes Tribe. At this rate, I am afraid they will destroy us all.</span>

[Cielo growls with frustration] <span style=""color: rgb(0, 204, 255);"">Aww, gimme a break! Didn't Serph kill der boss...? Why did de Solids join de Brutes, huh?</span>

[Gale looks at Argilla instead of answering Cielo] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Argilla... Tell me, would you follow Varin if he defeated Serph?</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">Of course I wouldn't.</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Heat?</span>

[Heat doesn't appear to be paying attention] <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Huh? I'd take Serph's place.</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Exactly. The law states that members of a defeated Tribe are to obey the leader of the victorious Tribe. That rule has been disregarded.</span>

[Argilla looks at her own hand as if she doesn't recognize it] <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">The law seems to be losing its effect on us. But, why could that be?</span>

[Gale's grey eyes sweep the room] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Everyone has changed, just as you have.</span>

[Argilla glares at him suspiciously] <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">It sounds to me like you knew about this all along. What were you planning to do?</span>

[Gale pushes a finger into the bridge of his nose] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">If the Wolves had held out, we could have fought the Brutes together. That is why this is so unfortunate.</span>

[A member of the Embryon rushed into the room and interrupts the meeting.]

Boss! Lupa, from the Wolves.... He's asking to see you.

[Gale turns to the man in surprise] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Did you say Lupa? Where did he come from?</span>

[The newcomer shakes his head] Well, you wouldn't believe it if I told you. We have them detained at Svadhisthana.

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Let us go, Serph.</span>

[Serph nods and they all leave the room]

<hr>

[The scene shifts in a burst of static. They are outside now, a group of strangers standing near an open grate that seems to lead down into a sewer system. The <a href=""http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/1/17374/877185-lupadds_large.jpg"">clear leader</a> is a dark-skinned man with red dredlocks and warpaint on his face. Gale and Serph walk towards him]

[Gale speaks first] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">State your business.</span>

[Lupa gazes at them coolly, but with determination] <span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">Will the Embryon assist us to defeat Varin?</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Under what conditions?</span>

[Lupa closed his eyes in contemplation. He is calm and resolute] <span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">Your leader will receive my head. In exchange, I ask you to treat my men fairly.</span>

[Gale slides out the knife hidden in his boot and brings his leg up and around. The blade stops touching the side of Lupa's neck and Gale stands frozen, balancing easily on one leg. Lupa didn't even flinch]

[Argilla cries out with shock at the sudden and brutal move] <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">Gale!</span>

[Gale still doesn't move, holding the bootknife to Lupa's throat] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">What assurance do we have that you are not here on Varin's behalf?</span>

[The Wolves by Lupa's side tighten their fists, ready for a fight, but Lupa holds out an arm to stop the impending confrontation.] <span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">I vow upon my honor.</span>

[Gale looks confused] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">Honour...? What is this ""honour"" you speak of?</span>

[Lupa gazes into Gale's eyes] <span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">I see it within you, as well.</span>

[But this doesn't enlighten Gale] <span style=""color: rgb(51, 153, 102);"">I do not comprehend. How does one see such a thing?</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">I can see it in your eyes.</span>

The Embryon Compound was largely underground, but there were high walls around the area, patrolled by guards with wicked-looking automatic rifles. Gale stood in the gateway, under the gently fluttering flag - a scrap of fabric with a splash of orange paint across it - that denoted this Embryon territory.

Beyond the walls were piles of junk, a maze of debris. The debris had been cleared so that no one could approach the compound without being seen and killed.

Gale had instructed the guards not to shoot until they'd verified that any approaching men were actually enemies. If Birkin didn't get killed by rookies in the wasteland, he should arrive at any moment. He wondered if Birkin's eyes would glow like Michael's had done."

Gale stood at the entrance, waiting. His blank, pupil-less silver eyes scanned the wastelands beyond the gate. He had an assault rifle slung over his back, but it was his only visible weapon.

Behind him, stairs descended into the upper reaches of the compound. A few soldiers patrolled the floor, and a couple of elevators were visible, which would provide access to the compound itself. It was grey, austere, military, but in a guerrilla, makeshift sort of way. The only colour were the splashes of orange paint on the walls, and the grey uniforms of the soldiers."

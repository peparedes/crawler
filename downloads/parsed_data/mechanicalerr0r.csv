I hate recording from now on to forever, but we got three songs in the pocket. They are being mixed and mastered, etc right now. Should get the cd's in a couple days. As soon as we do get them they will be on purevolume. Also should have alot of pictures from the trip soon on the site.

Two more days till we leave for North Carolina to record. It's going to be a blast. Also going grocery shopping tomorrow for the trip to save money.

The website looks like it's coming along nicely.

Also I hate my dad for passing on his migraine problems to me. In the middle of practice today, I got tunnel vision which means I'm going to be in a lot of pain within an hour to thirty minutes. I hate migraines so bad atleast I only get one every month or two. My head is still throbbing right now, but yeah I'm done complaining now.

One more week till we record. Hopefully we will have time to record more then our goal of three songs. Also our bassist can't make it so me or Tim are going to fill in on the bass tracks. It's going to be a crazy drive to North Carolina. I also started working seriously on the band page. It should be completely redone and up within a week or two. I think it looks spiffie so far.

Tim and I wrote from 5:00 to 10:00 today. Looks like we are up to almost five semi complete songs. Wade was here for half the time so he managed to get all the lyrics down to one song. Just need to get structure and lyrics down for the rest of the songs by the end of the month and we should be good.

Yesterday was one of my busiest days in awhile. First off, I saw school was cancelled at 11 Thursday so I figured, ""hey, I can sleep in so I'm gonna stay up late"". WRONG. Got awaken at 7:30 to find out I have to go get my blood pulled. Errg. Also stopped by Borders on the way home and got some stuff. Then when I got home I got a call saying we can practice today so I went over to Aaron's house and killed my ears for a couple hours. So far we sound really good especially after only two practices. Also looks like we have Wade singing and he has a great voice. THEN I got home again and remember that John and Dustin are playing that night, so I went over to landon's house and went with him to pick up Ryan and then go to Swayzes. The band before John and Dustin was a really good band also. Kind of a really spacey Yeah Yeah Yeah sound. But yeah after that they played and they sounded great. They added a lot of new parts and had everything equalized well, unlike at the 50's party. Went back to Landon's house after and stayed the night. Watched Battle Royale for the millionth time over there also.

(I guess) I've tryed different kinds of art, but I'm not very good when it comes to any type of visual art. I'm about to be seventeen, and I'm already uninterested and unsatisfied with doing anything. I'm burnt out. Nothing left to accomplish. I missed the good old pre-school days where everything was simple. Being able to write your name was enough to keep you satisfied for weeks. I think I just need to try and put myself out there, meet new people, make new friends, or find someone to be with.

Anywho I've come to a lack of words for now. Have to go move a bunch of amps, speakers, and drum equipment from my garage to my basement. Nothing like carrying a couple 4x12s down a long flight of stairs to your doom.

Also I have Mr. Hogan for floriculture and he is STARK RAVING MAD. He was telling us about how his mom tryed to kill him with a shovel, how he has a black sister, and how his mom bludgeoned one of his other sisters also. Plus what can you hate about a teacher who is semi deaf and calls everyone including himself and his wife ugly. Also chorus isn't bad at all. I've got the lowest vocal range in that class. I'm almost an octave below the other basses. I don't have anything good to say about odd days so I won't, except for the fact that I have a calculator that has games on it so pong is my life support. Whoever's idea it was to give algebra 2 students super calculators was an idiot.

"event","Egads I'm dying.

Of boredom and too much hemoglobin in my blood. I've already forgotten my biology phhf. The normal amount of hemoglobin according to the doctor in a person ranges from 8 to 12 or something. Mine was 15. Apparently I'm dehydrating myself severely somehow. 

Other than feeling severely violated at the moment from the physical the doctor gave me, I'm extremely bored. I need a new hobby or something. Or atleast try to socialize with more people. I'm becoming too much of a hermit. I've gotten to the point where I feel a phonecall is an invasion of privacy. If someone were to come over unexpectantly I gaurantee you I would probably chase them off with a broom. Like they were some kind of rabid, furry, trash-eating, rodent.

Also I hate vh1 now more then mtv. They made too much money off I love the 80s, and now they whore I love the 70s, 80s, and 90s all day long, everyday. I honestly can't remember what vh1 use to play now. All I hear about now is stuff that is dead and gone with a bunch of actors/comedians who are only funny about 5 percent of the time.

But having said that I'm done complaining. I was seeing how long I could drag this entry out because I'm bored. I don't know what I'm gonna write about when I run out of things to hate. (hahaha probably not gonna run out of stuff now that school is starting) 

p.s My apologies to those who wasted their time reading this.

Camelot has been properly cancelled and with that time sink gone. I'm back to having too much time on my hands. Woot.

Haven't really been doing much recently. I pretty much have been practicing sitting around doing nothing and taking long naps for when school starts this year. Also I have a car now. We had so many horses I was able to get my mom to trade a horse for the car. The guy owned a used car dealership in Alabama so we went there and looked at all the cars. 99.9% of them sucked and didn't run properly so we ended up with a 97 ford thunderbird. Haha we found the last owners weekly paycheck reciept in the back, and his name was Salvadore Andrada. Well, anywho Salvadore like any alabamian, mexicano tryed to pimp his ride with cheesy flame stickers on the side which I don't really want to leave on. But I guess I don't have a choice since they might take the paint off with them.

Also haven't been able to write any songs or do any new pictures even though boredoms usually my muse and gets me doing something. And Tripp and Adam came by and picked up Tripps line 6 head and his pa speakers because he's moving back to Rome with his parents. I'm gonna miss not being able to play through those again :( (Even though they probably killed my ears)

Well I'm boned at the moment can't think of anything else to write about.

My ears are ringing.

Last couple days have been very entertaining. Everyone but my dad is out of town for a week. So it's a peaceful, calm, quiet house. Went to alyssa's = fun. Then had mike, chris, and casey over today to jam and killed my ears. Only to most likely repeat tomorrow with jeremy, and tim L.

Also went to Landon's house met sam. And got casey to strap on some moonshoes and try to harass everyone in oakleigh including alyssa and anika but no one was home. :(

Anywho I can't cook worth crap and I'm starving to death. Only have two microwavable chimichangas left. I'm doomed.

"event","Haven't updated this in a week so I guess the time has come. Went to swayzes last night and it was probably one of the best shows I've ever seen there. The first band I don't know how to describe other then by saying they sounded like radiohead during the bends. (which = greatness) Then two ska bands that were good also. Followed by John and Dustin, who didn't quite fit in with the other bands. They gave a great show and it was probably their largest crowd yet. More then the first three bands. Also I gave alyssa a ride home in which me and landon tryed to terrify her with my driving skizills. I don't know if we managed to do it though, but it still gave me some enjoyment.

I've pretty much spent the whole week going back and forth from friends houses. And in between friend's houses I've been going crazy with photoshop... (click the my website link)

(yeah i said it do somethin bout it) Then today I went to aaron temperinos (I think thats his last name) house to jam with cory teefy, cory blair, and of course aaron. They sounded great but just need to work alittle better together. (that rhymed) Then tomorrow jeremy, tim l, and ian are coming over for another jam session.

"event","People are like bottle caps. They come in all kinds of different colors, but you don't know what flavor they are until you bite into them. You never know if your going to get a cherry, grape, orange, cola, or nasty rootbeer flavored one. I can't stand how some people can just judge people they don't know as stupid or bad. Making friends is kind of like biting into every damn bottle cap you find, you get some really tasty ones alot of the time, but will also get some rootbeer flavored ones. If that happens just move on. If you assume though that every bottlecap is rootbeer though you will never try any of them.

Sorry bout that figured I would just give alittle rant. Several things happened today that pissed me off. I swear theres been atleast one family incident for every week in the last month.

"event","Whatever happened to the good old days where you were happy just running around outside or something? Little kids and pandas have the life. All they do is sit around all day and eat bamboo. They don't have to worry about making sure their math homework is done or what mitochondria is in your cells. Pandas and little kids just live day by day. The burden of the future takes your mind off right now. Pandas don't do pointless things like watch tv. 

I hate tv. If the events and incidents that we experience in our life help develop the type of person you are and your personality, what happens if everyone grows up watching the same episodes of ""friends"" everyday. I won't be able to coexist with five Joeys running around where ever I am. You know there is something wrong if your teacher uses an analogy about friends to help explain a lesson. Also there are people starving to death all over the world and Jennifer Anistan gets 1 million dollars an episode..... I hate friends as much as I hate televangelism.

1.5 weeks left of school. woot... At the moment, I think I'm gonna burst into flames from contradictory statements. The end of school is near and I'm estatic about that, but at the same time I think it sucks because I'm gonna be bored as hell. Also I am too lazy to work, but I want money.... It's a fight between greed and laziness. hmm I think those are two deadly sins. Anywho I forget who it was, but ryan or kyle called me a stereotypical american because I want money but I don't want to work for it. 

I think greed won because I just chose to go work at Johnnys since tim and conrad can hook me up. Probably not a good idea for me to be a bus boy since I couldn't even stand doing my familys dishes due to being a clean freak.... but I think money can change the situation alittle.

In other news, tim L, jeremy, and me are jamming again and I'm having a great time. We are playing in my garage now, so I got lots of new toys to play with. Like tripps line 6 head and his two huge pa speakers. (I'm gonna kill my hearing) The head is confusing as hell and manages to scare the crap out of me everytime I turn it on.

Also I watched a wheelchair kid trying to get into a building today and it pissed me off because noone would help her get in. So as I was holding the door open I realize how much it must suck to be on a wheelchair in McEachern because there is no way to get into most of the doors unless someone helps you. And that was my good deed for the day and it made feel good. So like every report I'm gonna end it with my thesis statement. Hmmmmmm



Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "" Yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab"

"event","Hmm haven't written here in a couple days. My weekend was good I went to the kill bill thingy and had a good time. Then we went to a Waffle House nearby and chilled for alittle. Eventually I dropped off Drew around 12 and met up with Jeremy, Trip, and Tim. We hung out awhile and went to Jeremys apartment and watched a movie called Spun about some amphetamine junkies and stuff. It was fun I hadn't seen Jeremy or Trip for awhile and we jammed on some acoustics. It was good seeing him and Trip. Also Trip gave me a picture he made out of Nirvana cd booklets. He pasted them all into a picture frame that is like 12 by 14 inches it looks really cool. I'm working on finding space on the wall for it. Then I spent the rest of the weekend reading Dune having finished All quiet on the Western Front. They both were great books. I started Dune Messiah today and so far it's just as good. 

My parents are on vacation during the week. So it's just me, my brother and sister, and my grandmother. I have no idea where my parents are, but they said they would be back in a couple days. Anywho thats all I have to say for the moment.

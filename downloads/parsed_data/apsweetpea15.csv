It wouldnt have been that bad if i didnt have 50 million blisters all over my feet... trust me it hurts.

"event","I woke up to day at what i thought was 5 but my clock was set for an hour ahead so it was really 4 but i didnt kno that.  So i went into the livingroom and was watching to see if we were on the list. We weren't so i figured we have school so i'll go get ready. Then i went into the kitchen and saw it was 4 so i went back to bed and fixed my clock.  I set my alarm for 545 and was gonna get up then and check again to see if we really did have school.  Right as i finally was back asleep my sister busts in and screams ""SIS WE HAVE A SNOW DAY"" yeah that was at 530 in the morning. I was so mad at her. So i got up b/c its kind of hard to sleep with someone running through the house screaming snow day. Then at about 730 i went back to bed and didnt get up till about 1.  So i was gonna see if Amanda wanted to do something but she already had plans. So i was tlking to another one of my friends (not mentioning names) and we were gonna do something. So that was all good but we didnt end up doing nething. So we ended up getting in a fight online and she decided to go with one of her friends somewhere (i remind u we were supposed to do something)....hmmmmm yeah that made me just a LITTLE MAD! So i said some things to her that i now regret like that i didnt want to be friends with her anymore...oops:( Then i had to eat dinner. well I actually didnt eat because it was meatloaf.  First of all meatloaf makes me want to puke and i hate it...but on top of that lately my mom has been on this ""eating healthier"" kick lately so it was meatloaf made out of pork beef and veal. I'm sorry but i am not going to eat a baby cow! So i wasnt going to eat it and my dad made me eat some of it so i had one little bite of it. YEAH discusting... Everyone has been getting on my nerves today! So snowdays are supposed to be a good thing and be fun right? what do i get a horrible day!! Hopefully tomorrow will be better:/  So now i have to go work out so i dont get fat and so i stay in shape for track....O yeah I get my varsity jacket in 5 days!"

ps- kate we re-arranged the play room! it looks really good and i'm not just saying that because my L'Trimm portrait is in there. The rocking horses we found are the new tv chairs, last night jess and i danced in them to the Addams Family Values theme song that plays during the closing credits. Remember our Night Party? When you get back we're gonna have a Day Party, aka waking up at 6:am and partying till we drop. i nominate ""funneling Sparks"" as a Day Party activity."

  I wanted to get some feelers out to you all.  I'm looking to have 
someone design and tattoo for me.  I am asking you because you are a 
student at RISD and are 100% I'm sure better at these things then I!!!!  So, 
I would like to know if any of you would be interested in designing one 
for me, I know basically what I want....but have no idea how I want it 
be laid out so I'm looking for some ideas and someone to draw it out 
for me.  If you are interested please let me know!!

1. Put the seat back down when you're done blowing blow off the toilet
2. Lock the front door on your way in

i definitely can't stop grinning and i also think i'm very close to tears right now because i just came across http://bestiz.net .  uh huh.  k-pop music video recordings & music videos. 1993 to current top 20s. and more!
i could kiss someone right now.
<img src=""http://soul.mysticshrine.com/caps/group/shinhwa29.jpg"">
you want to go to the old stage section (these ones are very important):
28. seo taiji & boys '93
27. roo'ra '95 (the short girl was so influential to me)
25. h.o.t. '96 (kate you need to know about this)
in k-pop m/v:
58. seo taiji (solo) *** so good!
84. kim jin pyo (but only because the guy looks and moves just like nate)
182. jo pd (so posi!)
262. seo taiji & boys ('93) (kate i think you'd like this.. it's kindof gay)
263. s.e.s.-dreams come true (from the dance mix)
292. r.ef (the main singer was once voted the best looking man in korea and i agree except he's doing something weird with his face here sometimes. lots of male ass in this one. this one is dancey)
354. sungjinwoo (lots of female ass in this one)
461. lee hyun do (and every other notablehip hop artist in korea on the streets)
305. drunken tiger (hip hop)
you just got new summer plans and it's to learn k-pop dance moves!"

"event","I just wanna get married, really. Now I know that today there's a lot of people who'll tell you you're not supposed to want that, you're supposed to want something else, something bigger and better I guess, but more than anything that's all I want, I wanna start a family.  I know my own family still needs me around though, I live at home, and my paycheck-I wait tables and Murray's Diner, I make a dollar forty an hour plus tips-that's a big help, and of course you can never have enough people around to look after Ryan, he's my little brother, make sure he doesn't get hurt or nothing.  And I love 'em all to bits, Ryan, Mama, Dad, my sister Meg, but it's just that I've been living there so long now!  You know I'm twenty five years old, and that place is starting to feel like it's a little to small for me, like it's an old hand me down sweater I've grown out of.  Also, I know I'm not gonna be young forever, and at my age a girl wants a man!  Some days at the diner something handsome'll walk in that door and just for fun I think, maybe he's the one, Mr. Right.  Then I always try to grab that table right up and act real friendly.  Maybe I won't charge him for something, if he's that cute.  And yes now I know these days there's a lot of feminists around, up out of nowhere it feels like, and they'll tell you you're not supposed to care about getting married and things like that but really I think that's 'cause a lot of them are dykes, to be honest.  Not that I think there's anything wrong with dykes, mind you, I'm not sure if its natural but I actually know a bunch of them that are on my roller derby team.  We practice on Friday nights and most of the girls on the team are real nice, we always have a whole lot of fun, then afterwards we always go to the other diner, the one I don't work at, so that's a nice change.  My derby name's Rosie the Riveter.  Heck, I'm not even sure I know what a riveter is.  Sounds tough though, rite?"

""rock music is a thing in the past, so all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass""
<i>Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga tryin to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
I said, ""Sucker-ass nigga, I should shoot you dead""
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doin no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk</i>

rhyme, not time. that's so posi!"

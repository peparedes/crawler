"event","so basically everyone is back at school now.&nbsp; with the exception of those going to depaul and dominican.&nbsp; and i have my new job to look forward to.&nbsp; along with the many joys of sophomore year of college.&nbsp; it all seems so surreal.&nbsp; a few of us have held jobs for a long time now and its weird to think that in just a few short years we will all have full-time 9-5 jobs.&nbsp; its scary.&nbsp; we're still so young..but if you really think about it-life flies by and u really dont have enough time to pay attention to all the details unfortunately.

i just want everyone to get along.&nbsp; i dont know why its so hard for some people to just be nice to others and enjoy their company.&nbsp; i have friends from different clicks and its very hard to balance them..however, i manage it.&nbsp; i dont understand why its so hard for others to manage their time with different people.&nbsp; i do it all the time.&nbsp; and i still have 2 jobs!&nbsp; not 1 but 2!!!!

the end of this summer has really made me think about a lot of things.&nbsp; like taking a deeper look at where my life is headed.&nbsp; i have wanted to be a teacher since i was probably about 10 years old...and because i screwed up my freshman year of college with getting c's in my math classes, i think it will take me a little longer to achieve my goal which makes me extremely upset.&nbsp; i dont wanna miss out on graduating with my class just because i didnt work hard enough for one year.&nbsp; it sux when you get behind in something like this and then u have to work ur butt off to get it back.&nbsp; thats what im gonna do this year..im gonna get back on track even if it takes 2 years to do it.&nbsp; i dont wanna give up on my dream just cuz some school says i can't make it.&nbsp; i'll show them.




and personally....i really believe that relationships create more drama and problems than being single.......so my advice to u out there...stop with the bull shit and say what u mean."

"event","so this whole summer has flown by faster than i ever imagined.<br /><br />it seemed like i was gonna have such a blast with all of my friends being home, but unfortunately, that wasnt how it was a lot of the time, i was constantly working and going to summer school. always being worried about the class put a huge damper on my time to have fun. i spent the majority of my time at work and hanging out with my friends from OG for the sole reason that they make me feel like im important and they pay attention to me. sometimes its nice to just blend in with the crowd and then its nice to feel appreciated and wanted. <br /><br />saying bye to your friends is never easy. however the second time around really isnt as bad as i thought it was going to be. and not seeing my friends every day this summer has also kinda made it easier because its not like i spent every waking moment with them. i know now that i can succeed on my own without all of my friends being there all the time, but it still sucks to see them all leave home again.<br /><br />a few things have been scheduled for the upcoming year and i couldnt be more excited. i just really wish i was included in certain things. and i hate inviting myself so i refuse to do that.<br /><br />it sucks that not everyone gets along like we all used to. but we all said it was going to happen. not one of us denied the fact that going to school would change each and every one of us. you know you have your best friends that are always gonna be there for you. sometimes it sucks when theyre not...<br /><br />i dont know what im trying to get across in this journal i just felt like i needed to update it.&nbsp; i had some really good times this summer, with my birthday being a surprise from my friends...ive never had that before, and the trip to cabo, and the pimps and ho's party my work friends threw for me and kylie and hannah..i just wish it wasnt all over so soon. and saying bye to kylie sucked because she really has become one of my best friends. im really gonna miss her when she's gone.<br /><br />im kind of excited to go back to school because i want to get back to a schedule. and im also very excited to be starting my new job at the nordstrom in woodfield. i plan on concentrating on my schoolwork because i dont want another scare like the one i had this summer.<br /><br />wishing everyone well<br />ill be updating again soon.<br /><br /><font size=""3""><br /><font color=""#ff0033"">""we hoped for the best and let go of the rest.""</font></font><br /><br /><font size=""2"">&lt;33</font>"

"event","my summer has been solidddd..in the past few days i have probably had more fun than ive had in a long long time.&nbsp; i didnt realize how much i missed my friends who went away to school till they came home.&nbsp; and that goes for all of them.&nbsp; no matter how much i talked to them or how much i didnt talk to them, it feels really good to have them all home.
and i love how i have made lasting friendships with people at work.&nbsp; seriously they are all good people and i love that i have so many different groups of friends. its just a great feeling

i start summer school in 2 weeks so im tryin to get as much partying or whatever in in the time span before my freakin class starts....blahhh
i dont mind that i have to take summer school cuz i know its only because i fucked up and i did it to myself so im not complaining, i just regret not taking the time to study more or put a lot more effort into my class.&nbsp; 

i will be trained as a server as of monday, june 11, 2007 and i could not be any more excited.&nbsp; i have been waiting to be trained to serve for a very long time and i finally get to do it!!
so u all better come to OG and sit in my section =)

so far this summers lookin up
this has probably been one of the best weeks so far
and it can only get better!!!

"event","i have something to say:

i am seriously so fucking&nbsp;tired of feeling like i dont matter to the people that matter to me.&nbsp; i always find myself thinking..would any of these people come to my funeral if i died tomorrow?..it just really makes me think..have i really ever lived? or am i just playing by the rules.. do i really have close friends that would do anything for me? or are they just playing it safe... have i ever loved anyone or will anyone ever love me?&nbsp; will i ever amount to anything?..or am i picking the wrong job?&nbsp; 

college arises so many different questions about urself that u never would think u would ask urself.&nbsp; i always thought being a teacher was the right decision for me.&nbsp; i love kids and i have wanted to teach since i was in kindergarten.&nbsp; i just dont know if i want to jump into everything so damn soon!&nbsp; ive never felt like i could do anything other than teach because i have such a passion for it, but all of these tedious assignments are making me rethink all of it..and this constant battle with family and friends of ""will i ever do something good enough for you?""&nbsp; ive just always felt like i could never do anything worth praise..or that someone always had something better to shove right in my face.&nbsp; when i do something im proud of, i like to tell people...but it just always seems that what i have to say isnt as important as what others have to say.&nbsp; it just makes me feel that i dont deserve to be happy just like everyone else.&nbsp; i just never feel like anyone is ever interested in what i have to say or any of the stories in my life.&nbsp; i know that almost all of the things that happen to me aren't as special as yours but to me they mean something and it would be really nice if everyone else would feel that same appreciation for me.&nbsp; nobody ever seems interested when i talk about school or when i talk about work and i just constantly feel like people are putting me down for the things that i do.&nbsp; its my life and i make my own decisions.&nbsp; i refuse to let anyone push me around or make me regret those decisions because you dont think its the&nbsp;right choice.&nbsp; I know that ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" but most of the time it really feels that way because ive never experienced the ""other side"" so to speak.&nbsp; i have never stood out in a crowd as being the smartest, or the prettiest, or the best athlete, or the funnest to be around.&nbsp; i've always just been the girl in the corner or in the middle of a group...never the center of attention.&nbsp; and i guess thats just how my personality is but sometimes it would be nice to feel as if people were looking at ME and thinking ... wow that girl is talented or wow she must have an amazing life...its just that no1 ever thinks...wow how is stephanie doing? or..i know she'll do something great with her life.&nbsp; i know i have a family that loves me and i know i have friends that will always be there for me its just nice to see that they actually care about what i have to say or that they actually care what happened to me that week at school, or how work went for me that week, or that they would be interested that i did good on one of my tests that i was worried about, or that im getting ""promoted"" at work, or that i got in a fight with this girl at school..or whatever might have happened....even though im not away at school, important things happen to me and it would be nice to have someone to share them with.&nbsp; even if its just to give me a call, or to just say hey online.&nbsp; there are a certain few people that i talk to on a day to day basis..like brian-i know hes always there to listen to me talk about how amazing at life i am or give me advice on anything......friends like that help me get through things.&nbsp; im not in depression or anything like that so dont get worried, i just spend a lot of my time thinking what if....really what if i died tomorrow? would anyone care? would it matter? have i made a difference?...questions like that scare the hell out of me and i dont want the answers, i just want to feel like it was worth it or that i matter to others.

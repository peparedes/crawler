That drip of hurt
That pint of shame

Leave your conscience at the tone

At the end of the millenium

Where it's like the twilight zone

At the end of the millenium

"event","In german school. we are writting a ""news paper"" and everyone else has to write stories and stuff.. so this is one i came up with, its about my favorite song..

Redundant.

because i love this song. 

The definition of Redundant: Characterized by or containing an excess or superfluous amount. 

This song,was written by Billie Joe Armstrong, the lead singer of green day. It is about loving someone so much that love can't express how much you DO love them.

We're living in repetition.
Content in the same old shtick again.
Now the routine's turning to contention,
Like a production line going over and over and over, roller coaster

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words.

Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted now
I waste it, faked it, ate it, now i hate it

Cos I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words.

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
'Cause I love you's not enough
I'm lost for words.

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant

Friday~ Parties in everyclass at school! Oh yeah. Finished up Cinderlla man in American Studies, it was probably the sadddest movie. Well not really, but it was pretty sad. I also found out something pretty rad!...you all will have to wait til Wednsday tho

Also, went to see King Kong with Corey on friday. It was a little long. But an overall good movie

Saturday- Christmas Eve. Got ready for church, went to church, did churchly things with Timmy , Derek, Timmy's sister and my sisters. Then went out to dinner at Steak and Ale with my Aunt. Then my mom drove me and laur back to church for the Candlelight Service so we can play in the bell choir with Bri and Nat. Because we are that kool.

Sunday-  Christmas, very good! Got alot of GreenDay things, like books, Cd's, mag's. But most of all I got my iPod nano. Its very kool. its black  Corey came over so we cpuld exchanged gifts. I love the necklace he got me. Once he left, i still had to get my self ready. Then we headed over to my Oma's [grandmoms in german]

Monday- Resting Day from Christmas, got used to iTunes.

Tuesday- Christmas at My Aunt and Uncles. Hung out with my 5 year old cuzz. Hes awesome. We played with hotwheels (oh yeah) and some action figures. I also agreed to come over and babysit him the next day.

Weds- Babysitting my cuz, then went out to the movies with Corey. We were going to see a 9:40 Producers...but when we went into the theater it was full with no seats.. so that kinda stunk. So we went with his mom and sister to see Family Stone. Pretty funny move and half sad.

Thursday- Christmas with my dad's side. Kool time. They were over and we all just chilled out. Played King Kong on the PS2 and DDR.

Friday- Chilled out agian.

Saturday- New Years Eve. Made plans for New Years.  Went to Seth's party for a while. Christine couldnt go, so i eneded up being the only girl there... Watched the guys play pool, and DDR. Later, me and corey came back to my house to celebrate new years with my family. The girls wanted to see Corey play me in DDR, which they did. And he beat me most of the time  

Today- My Aunt and Uncle and my cuz'z r coming over for Lunch. And later I have no clue.."

This christmas is going to be 'specally awesome with Francis and Rosa coming up from Arizonia/Nevada area.  I really cant wait to see them! I miss my older cuzz soo much.

Recently, I have cut my hair and had it highlighted for Winter Formal. The hair cut is way to shot, due to a couple mistakes that the hair lady made. Winter formal was a great time [ and four months for me and corey], and i am still shocked that Corey came back to be with me just for a dance. It still brightens my day. i finally go to meet Jenna's Corey also. 

My mom put together a Church Christmas Celebration, which was so much fun. She did a good job running the whole thing. She also directed a play which i was in

Mr.Strange- Dad
Mrs. S- Mom
Me- Janelle
Timmy- Steve
Brian- Mikey
Kristin- Tiffany

Basically it was a play about a family who got side tracked with the tru meaning of christmas.
""What if i was chineese!!!"" -- timmy before the play.. hes one funny kid.

I am also involved in the churches bell Choir with laur, Natalie, and Brian. I play bells , C6, D6, and E6.. oh yeah

Thrus- Thanksgiving!! Our heater broke. )-: so it was FREEZING! Later on my family and I went to my Aunts and Uncles for thanksgiving. Super time. Played Pinball and Monopoly (-: 

Fri- Heater still broken, and the guy finally came out to fix it. Sammy was going NUTS over him, barking and crying. Finally the guy left, and my dad took me to coreys. Coreys dad came for me and we went to the Bowling Alley where I met up with Corey. We did two games (one he won and one I won), then I met some of his extended family, went back to his house, sat around, played on the gutiar and Super Nintendo. Ate some dinner and then watched Hitch.

Sat- Went shopping at Williow Grove with Jillian W. Then later on was vikkis sweet 16. That was a blast! It was at a Russian Resturant in NE Philly. The people only spoke russian and the entertainers that sang only sang Russian. The other Entertainers were really good! they did magic, danced.. the usal. Me, Rosie, Oksana, Jill, Monica, and Briana all danced to Russian Techno/ American Techno.. fun fun (-: 

Sun- Went to church, then  went to do the crafts for the first advent. I got stamped by Brian lol! Came home, and made plans with Corey. Watched the game for a bit, then went to get Corey so we could go to the movies. On our way there we almost got hit by a drunk driver!! o-:  it was soooooooo scary. it was. Then we got Corey and went to the movies. The mall and theater was not that packed.. i was surprised.. but when we went into the Theater it was pretty full. 

Mon- went to coreys with the guys to play d&d with them

Has my conscience beating
The sound in my ear
The will to preserve as I reach the Break of day

When you lost all hope and excuses
And the Cheapskates and the losers
Nothing's left to cling on to
You gotta hold on 
Hold on to yourself

A plea for peace
And my conscience beating
It's not what I want for it's all that I need
To reach the break of day

With my conscience bleeding
Here lies the truth the lost treasures of my youth
As I hold on to the break of day

Deadbeat Holiday
Wake up the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone
Icon is the last chance for hope
When there's no such think as heroes
Your faith lies in he ditch that you dug yourself in

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when the lights are going down

Oh deadbeat hoilday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh deadbeat hoilday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's handing high
But at least you're not alone

The christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find 
That you're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay when the lights are going down

Oh deadbeat hoilday
celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh deadbeat hoilday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's handing high
But at least you're not alone

Suicide

HOLY CRAPOLA! KANSAS SINGS THIS SONG TO! ITS SUCH A GREAT SONG!! thanks soooooooo much to Mr. M for burning all this stuph for me and my dad!!
 
I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind
Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see

Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind

Don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, all your money won't another minute buy

Dust in the wind, All we are is dust in the wind

The other bands that played before GBU were good also, The New Borns,  and...uhh.. i forget the other one. But yeah it was really good and alotta fun, just hanging out, taking pictures and being blinded by the flash. Lol, even though Jenna got knocked off a chair. 

Today- Went to church, Gonna go to walmart b/c they have a sale on CDs today, then get changed nd head over to Jenna and Jills y/g

ahhhh Kansas rocks.. ""carry on wayword son"" is a good song. its one of those songs were you know the song, but you dont know the band

Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Now don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin',
I can hear them say

(Chorus)
Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Now don't you cry no more


Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely 
   means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of  moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but
   I hear the voices say

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

(Chorus)"

When we left the movie we ran into Sam, Duda and duda's girlfriend Emily. it was awesome seeing duda agian..i havent seen him forever. Then we walked around for a bit and I saw Kev, Alex and another guy... but i called out to Kev..and he didnt hear me.. ): oh well lol! After that, Corey called his mom b/c the movie ended early and we ran into his mom and brother anyway. We went out for ice cream and then they dropped me off at home.

Today- Went to the first day of German School. First person i saw was Gabi so i talked to her and found out that we have the same teacher (thank god)-- herr. mitchell-- and then i saw Jess and Alex and found out that they were in the same class as me. yay! haha. So we get to class (the american studies room) and we are split up. 8th and 9th graders (in that school.. you see they put you in grades based on the amount of german you know), and we start working on Work sheets. Gabi turns to me and says "" look, he has blood on his back"" I look at him, and he does!!! it was really gross. So i tell Alex and she goes , "" YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR BACK!"" so he goes out for about 15 mins to get changed into a new shirt and gets a band-aid. So we continue on with class.. 12 rolles along, and we are let out of class, i walk to Frau Lynne's room and talk to her, then leace to find my dad and sisters..so yeah that was the first day of german school."

"event","First day of school was the shit. 

I wake up about 5:45 in the morning and I am getting ready for school with laura since she is now on our bus, i get on the bus, we are going on our usal route, but with MORE KIDS!!! ahh!! haha. 

the bus pulles up to the front of the school, and Dan the bus driver lets all the High Schoolers off. I see Ashliegh and im like ""yay shes back!"" i get off the bus she jumps on me and wraps her legs around me and starts screaming, "" AMY AMY AMY!"" ... yeah... so i see vikki and catch up with her, me and jenna and vikki walk into school (haha blonde, red, and brunette soo hott) So we get into school, the 5 minute bell rings. I head up to home room and yeah sit around. Pezza was talking about ""becoming more stricker with the hoomroom rules"" yeah right pezza like that'll ever happen. Homeroom lets out and i get out of the classroom with Jilli and we were standing around in the hallway all the sudden i see corey. I was soo happy to see him b/c i missed him while he was away. I countinue on with the rest of the day going to bio, and geom, american studies. and i go to lunch. OMG IT WAS SOO COLD!! i also have alotta freshies in my lunch (des, chrissy, jim..) bell rings off to Computer Graphics. Me Jill and oksana walk into class and i see Rosie! I missed her over the summer! me and her were really hyper, talking real loud and real fast.  German is my last period..but as they say, the best for last, which is true i guess, German is a really fun class to take. 

After school there was a drama meeting. Me and Jillian had no idea where to go so we walked around until we found BRITT!!! AHH!! I <3 her she is my favorite freshman of all time. and we meet up with a bunch of other people. and talkd and went to the meeting.. which was kool b/c paul is now joining. 

after the meeting, paul invited me to go to DQ with him and corey then walk up to Fishers afterwords, and duh i wanna go b/c i wanna hang out with Corey. So we walk down to DQ and there are freshman there (des,  jeanne, chrissy, sar..) i talk with them for bit, steal Pauls bouncy ball and go to eat.  After eating we head over to fishers and hang out over there, watch a movie, watch corey, paul and fisher sword fight, and hang out by the pool and get wet. it was fun

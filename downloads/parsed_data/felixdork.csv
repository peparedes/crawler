 <h3>Wake up for the morning commute</h3>
I'm <h4>FELIX</h4> and I'm a dork.
I'm loquacious when I want.
I'm <h5>mean</h5>, <h4>loyal</h4>, <h5>vainglorious</h5>
Politics defines <h4>ME</h4>.
Resentful and bitter, and most definitely
<h5>FRIENDS-ONLY</h5>

<h6>...show me your iPod playlist
and I love your shoes</h6>

"event","I think there comes a time when your livejournal becomes so much more than it was before. I never really knew that when I first signed up for this account that I would actually be using it. In fact, this LJ has kept me content at times, happy in others, frustrated sometimes, and have even helped me thereupeutically. It's helped me grow. And I just started posting this January of 2005. Imagine what wonders it would do for me in a years time, or even 2 or maybe even 5?

<!--
The point is, alot of the things here are so private to me, so cherished, and so important to me that I just can't let random people just read it (not that anyone random WOULD want to read it). So I decided to make my journal <b>FRIENDS ONLY</b>. If you want to read about me, and my stuff before it was friends-only, just add me and then comment in the entry above. -->"

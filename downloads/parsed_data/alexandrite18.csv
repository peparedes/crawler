"event","So I'm back in NJ. Been here since Jan. 15. Everything was going well until I found out my dad was drinking again. Stupid shit, I swear. Then I get into my car to drive Janal home, and my car radio/cd player is missing. So I'm pissed.

Let me elaborate: I'm waiting at the train station for my dad to pick Janal and I up. He comes completely plastered. I'm like wtf?! We get in the car and he's going, and hits a parked car. Not bad, thank god. Just a little tap, but nonetheless, it was scaring the hell outta me. Then we go, and I've got to tell him when to stop and when to go at traffic lights and shit, so we don't die. I'm ready to shit myself. Then I thought he was going to stop at a red light, and he doesn't stop soon enough, so he stops right in the middle of the intersection. I'm like, ""YO! You can't fucking stop here, you've gotta go, now that you're already here..."" So he went. Now, 571 is a two lane highway, so he can't pick a lane to stay in, so he's just driving down the middle of the road. Then we get into our complex and he misses our parking lot. So I tell him to back up and go again. He nearly hits another parked car in the parking lot. I was so completely pissed, it was unbelieveable. So we get in the house, and he crashes on the couch with his coat on and everything, and passes out. 

I'm going to go clean off my car and warm it up so I can take Janal home, and I get in and my cd player is missing. Now, my dad said he was going to fix it (it was doing some weird shit), so I figured he had taken it out to repair it, so I thought nothing of it. Mind you, when I went to my car, the doors were unlocked. 

When Sharon was going to take us to the train station, to go to Michigan, I let her borrow my car because hers was messed up. So it was in her posession for the 3 weeks I was gone. She doesn't usually lock doors, so she didn't think to lock mine. Don't you think that if the car isn't yours, you'd lock it anyway? But whatever. 

So I tell my dad the next day, ""My cd player isn't in my car. I guess you tried fixing it, have any luck?"" He says to me, ""I didn't take your cd player out of your car."" I start flippin out. I'm like, ""So then it's been stolen."" He's like, ""I guess so. Were the doors unlocked?"" I'm like, ""Yeah."" He's like, ""So then it was, cuz I never took it out, I forgot about it, actually."" So yes, Sharon left my doors unlocked and the cd player was stolen. Should she be responsible for it? I believe so, and so does every other motherfucker on the face of this planet.

So I tell my mom, she's like, ""Tell her that it was her responsibility to take car of your car and she didn't by not locking the doors, and now she's responsible for what ever is missing."" I completely agreed, and confronted Sharon. She started screaming, talking about, ""I never lock any of my doors, or my car doors. So I shouldn't be responsible when I didn't lock your car door. I don't even want to talk about this anymore, it's ridiculous."" I said, ""But don't you realize that it was someone elses car, and you neglected to take care of it?"" She said, ""No, because I don't ever think to lock anything, I didn't neglect to take care of your car."" End of conversation. I go in my room, call my mom, tell her what just went on (mind you, I'm bout ready to cry cuz I'm so completely FUMED). She was like, ""Lemme talk to your father."" (My dad didn't say anything throughout the whole conversation and that made me even more pissed that he wouldn't even take my side, because he was the one that bought the damn thing, and he would have been pissed also if it had happened to him.) So my father gets on the phone, my mom is saying something to him, and Sharon grabs the phone and yells, ""I don't ever lock anything, I'm not responsible for anything."" SCREAMING, nonetheless. Then hangs up the phone on my mom. WTF?!?!? So my mom calls back, and she's pissed. Sharon had already left and slammed the door behind her. 

So Sharon and I haven't been on speaking terms since. She hasn't even bothered to appologize to me or my mother, and I think that she is very childish, and I don't really think I can hold another intelligent conversation with her at all from now on. There will be nothing for us to discuss because I will not be involved with her. She will never borrow my car again, or get any favors from me. I will never help her with computer word processing problems or anything. She is ridiculous, she didn't need to do that to my mom. I've kept all my responses to her, short and simple. I don't need to talk to someone who acts like they are 10. Sorry. Everyone has agreed on that, including older adults. Not just my friends that would take my side in a heartbeat. 

On a lighter note, I've started the Spring semester at college. I'm taking: Bio 101 lab and lecture, Spanish 202, English 101, and Algebra 141. I'm doing well so far, the semester only started on the 20th. I just bought the last of my books today. lol

So, Laura and I are planning to move into an apartment together in July, or near it. We want somewheres close like Hamilton. Not too dingy, I can't stand that. So I'm working back at Shoprite to save up some more money for the security deposit and stuff. I also applied for a credit card, so I can get me some credit. lol I'm really excited cuz I really can't stand to be in the same room as Sharon and I really can't stand my dad and his drinking. Even though he is back in AA. I just can't deal with that. I mean, if things don't work out, I can always move back in, but I will try to make it work 100%. Moving back in there will be my last resort, so I'm going to work really hard to keep what I have. Laura and I also discussed our differences and wants from each other when we move in, just to make sure we can live together and to also make sure there aren't any surprises. lol Just makes things move more smoothly. My mom said, ""You should do that because I'd really hate to see you loose your friendship with her over something like that."" So we did, and we have agreed upon many things. =) I love you, Laura! I can't wait!

Janal and I aren't on speaking terms either. Neither are Brenda and I. We were all drinking at Brenda's house one night. We got into this argument and I left. It's not even worth discussing what happened, because after all I did for them, they can just shove it. I just need my stuff back from Janal and I'll be all good. They can live they're sad little lives alone without me. I mean, unless they appologize, I will appologize too. But I doubt they will be mature enough to handle that. Soo...

I guess I will end here, I have a class that starts at 11:55 so I will write more (if I have anything else) when I get home!
P.S. - I died my hair, and I'm getting highlights in it tomorrow! It looks so cute!!!

"event","Well I'm here at my Mom's house. Had a good Christmas. Got: Foot scrubbie thingies, Estee Lauder perfume set, PJ's, a sweat suit outfit, gift card to BNB from Aunt Jamie, manicure/pedicure set, Diary of Alicia Keys, a $100 IOU from Mom for the mall. 
I got the first HP book, hair straightener, and Boy Meets Boy book from Laura. W00t cuz there's another surprise...lol. 
I got a Sony Clie (a PDA) from my Dad before I came here.
I got Daniel and little journal notebook thing, and a Terry Pratchet book.
I got Janal a Healing Garden set in White Tea (I think).
I got my Dad an electric shaver that I'm not sure he used yet cuz I keep forgetting to ask him when he calls me. 
As for New Years: It was good. I drank some. Didn't party too much cuz there wasn't a whole lot to do. No one else our age was around. We played Uno, then chilled the rest of the night. Maybe if it was a bigger crowd like I remembered it a few years ago, I might have had more fun. lol.
Other than that, things are going well here. My mom goes back to work Monday, as do the children to school. So Janal and I will have the house to ourselves for the daytime. =)
Well, gonna go make use of the rest of the night.

"event","So I went to Janals this morning to pick up her suitcase. I'm glad it was so small. But I got off to a late start this morning, so I couldn't really stay long. So I went to Shoprite on my way home to pick up a few things for my contribution to the family Christmas dinner we're having tonight at my uncles. I'm making these really good biscuits. Yum. Then I came home, got some laundry together for my dad to do. Finished wrapping all the presents for the kids. I'm having mom take them back with her, along with the luggage. It's going to be very nice not having to bring all that crap with me. =) When I come home, I'll just have the luggage, which is small. =) So it's all good. Now I gotta wait for the laundry to get done and then pack it. Then take a shower then go! Eat lotsa good food!

Then tomorrow I gotta wrap my dads present, then go with Laura to her aunts. Get right. lol. 

Monday, my dad and I are exchanging presents. I'm excited. Monday, after my final I'm getting Janal. Monday night my dad and I are exchanging the presents. =) It's all good. Then Tuesday we leave! I'm so excited! W00t! 

Well I've got shit to do, so I'll end this now. Maybe I'll write later...

Why are you hiding from me
I'd quickly give my freedom
To be held in your captivity

I am ready for love
All of the joy and the pain
And all the time that it takes
Just to stay in your good grace
Lately I've been thinking
Maybe you're not ready for me
Maybe you think I need to learn maturity
They say watch what you ask for 
Cause you might receive 
But if you ask me tomorrow 
I'll say the same thing

I am ready for love
Would you please lend me your ear?
I promise I won't complain 
I just need you to acknowledge I am here

If you give me half a chance
I'll prove this to you 
I will be patient, kind, faithful and true
To a man who loves music
A man who loves art
Respect's the spirit world
And thinks with his heart

I am ready for love
If you'll take me in your hands
I will learn what you teach
And do the best that I can

I am ready for love
Here with a offering of 
My voice
My Eyes
My soul
My mind

Tell me what is enough
To prove I am ready for love

I am ready"

"event","So, today was my last Computer Art class. I am getting a 91% this semester. It feels good to have done so well. I also took a make-up test for Algebra, and I got a 96%. So I feel extra good! 

So here's the scoop on my mom's visit:
Thurs. evening- Mom gets in, I might probably sleep over there because on Friday I need to watch my sister and brother while my mom is in court.
Fri- Watch the kids, then when mom gets home, go shopping or something. Hopefully shopping cuz we will have almost no time to do it on Saturday.
Sat- Pick up Janals suitcase in the morning. Go back to my house and get ready for Christmas dinner/party at my Uncle Eddy's house. Go to Uncle Markie's, leave from there with my mom to the party thing.
Sun- Mom leaves early with Janal's and mine suitcases. EARLY, like early. Then I have the whole day to myself.

It kinda screws up my plans with Laura...good thing I called my mom tonight. I didn't even call her about anything but when she was leaving. When she said Sunday I almost cried. lol. Cuz that screwed EVERYTHING up for me. The whole shopping and luggage thing. Then my sleepover with Laura. Man I was pissed. But ce la vie (sp?). 

I have class early tomorrow, so I will go to bed now. Goodnight, fellow airheads.

My mother will be coming out here on Thursday evening. I'm excited about that, I haven't seen her in a while. She leaves next Monday, then Janal and I leave Tuesday! I'm uber-excited about that one. =) Everything is going good.

Donate to you local Laura-cef. She needs donations for a new house and car. Don't worry all of your hard working money is going towards a great cause! Just deposit in appropriate boxes. We'll even get the small children involved.

I had the most amazing cup of coffee from Starbucks today. Explicitly a white chocolate mocha. =) Made me so happy, I was considering getting a second, but I knew I shouldn't spend Daddy's money! Yup...

Wellll...so I'm going to get going, to bed or something. See you guys all later!

Today I did some cleaning and review for my English final. Fun fun fun. Oh, went to the store and did laundry, too. Shoulda thrown a party!
I'm excited about my trip to Michigan on the 23rd. A friend of mine is coming. I hope everything works out. It's going to be nice cuz I'm gonna be out there for 3 weeks and a day. YES. It's a wonderful life.

I paid half of my Spring 2004 tuition on Friday, the 12th. I just don't have enough to pay it in full. ...bastards... I don't have to pay the other half till the 20th of February. 

Go here: http://www.livejournal.com/users/slayerbxtch/

Well I'm going to either go to bed, fold some more laundry, or be a looser and study for my final tomorrow. =)

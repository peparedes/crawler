"event","ok people sorry i have not updated my journal in sooooooo long. i've been so busy, i was in burbank all this week, partying with friends and visiting my family. pretty cool wekend.Candice that sucks, u should learn to control wut u say cuz that really hurt her, you didnt even give her a chance to explain. and you do go off with that grl sara a lot i hear, so dont say that they ditch you, holly is bianca's bf now bcuz you were ditching bianca, thats the only reason why she is closer with holly, maybe you should just apologoze 2 the both of the and say that you want to be best friends again, but u dont like my sister and she knows, even though u didnt want her to know. she sneaks around and finds stuff, she wants to be your friend, but your just pretending to like her when u dont, that sux. i think ive made this long enough so i'll stop but you should really talk to holly.kk

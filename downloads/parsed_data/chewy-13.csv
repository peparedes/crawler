"event","My colleague recommended me to visit this<em> Marutama Ra-men</em> at <em>the Central</em>. Ordered the chicken soup based ramen with an additional order of seasoned egg&nbsp;(quite a clever selling technique). I&nbsp;was pretty excited as my colleague told me it was the best she ever eaten here in SG.. So, with &quot;high expectation&quot;. I was pretty disappointed upon the presentation of the ramen as you can see below.. But it is not as important as the taste i would say. The ambience of the restaurant kinda make up for the presentation. <br /><br /><a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/lilyrose/485148603_b35600f63a.jpg""><img height=""225"" width=""300"" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/lilyrose/485148603_b35600f63a.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />The noodle in the thick broth was really tangy. :&gt; The <em>seasoned egg</em> was REALLY&nbsp;REALLY&nbsp;nice... it looks like hard boiled egg on the outside and you don't really expect the yolk inside to be in bright orange colour with jelly-like texture. The seasoned egg tasted really unique and for that moment i would want to get hold of the recipe. :&gt;. The simplicity of the ra-men is to bring out the flavour of such common food like eggs. Tried the gyoza, the skin was really thin and smooth and the fillings was fresh! yumms.. it came with lots of vinegar and&nbsp;I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;vinegar.. and i don't have to like dip my gyoza in those small dishes. SIMPLY love it. <br /><br />Priced at 12 bucks..seasoned egg at 1 buck.. gyoza at 5 bucks, i feel that the ra-men was definitely more pricey compared to the others, but the ambience was relaxing and the chefs are Jap..and they all speak Jap kinda feel myself in Jap.. lol :&gt;<br />"

However after talking about it with friends/ jack i get a tad bit better and start to get the motivation to work in the current environment. 

The sense of self-worth is really important to me. It gets me going.&nbsp; :&gt;

I want to do more shopping!! You know me, when i was a student i was really broke to buy new clothes. Then when i started working, with cash popping out in the bank account, i tend to splurge on things which i always wanted to buy when i was in the Uni. Then.. i started online shopping, checking out new collections every now and then. Buy things to coax my loved ones is kinda destressing activity for me, then i realised i begin to take extraaa good care of your body and face."

And i can say our wait was worth it AGAIN! :> It is definitely more than Robots with human emotions. You guys should catch it to know more! Is a show that goes beyond all languages and culture as there is little dialogue.. Is really hard to make a movie with a meaningful message to get through to us!

When i was watching the show, i was brimming with emotions. Emotions that overwhelmed me. Those little gestures in the movie were really heart warming, cute and nice. You've got to watch it to understand what i really means. 

So.. 2 thumbs up for Wall -e!!

Went to the open house and it rained, delayed the aerial display for 50 minutes. But i'm sure our wait was worth it!! The aerial display also has a plot with it! 
It was really nice to see fighter jets in action so close to us! Really enjoyed the show.. so those aviator enthusiasts you guys should really go!!"

Anyway my team consists of peepz from ntu/nus. In fact, one of my colleagues is actually Jack's game development friend's gf in NUS! How nice! so yea, we hit it off, and i hope it will last. Yea, so for the first week i'm still adapting to the environment, alright so far. 

For my weekend, i organized my JC bbq gathering, and it went out well! 3/4 of the class turn up! So happy about it! Grace even said that i signed on for being JC class rep for life. But is okay.. once in a while is kinda fun. 

a taste of hows full-time work like for a week, i've to re-schedule a lot of things, juggle more things because i never see myself as a workaholic. In fact my goal is to be a person living a well balanced life. I will not never feel proud being a workaholic because it just show that i am missing out on a lot of things in life. I guess the few aspects like personal time, bf relationship, friendship, family, hobbies, new skill, the hardest to juggle probably is friendship and bf relationship. If it happens that your bf or friends are career minded, workaholic bunch of people, it requires 2 hands to make a clap.&nbsp; So probably.. is about having the right mindset and the right techniques! 

All the best to those who are already in the working society!"

Kinda enjoy my holiday except for the staying up late part, don't know for whatever reason, i can't sleep until is 2/3 am. I know is bad for health, face and stuff, but maybe i should force myself to sleep at 12 for 21days. 

Tried cooking a soup- watercress soup, which was quite easy to cook. I was able to remember the ingredients and the steps after browsing the soup recipes in a bookshop. So it should be quite easy for anyone. If i rem correctly, i woke up at 7a.m to buy fresh pork and watercress, cooked it for 3 hrs and it turned out to be very nice according to my parents and jack. :&gt; 

Right now i just hope that i will have the ""will"" to experiment with more recipes after i realized that staying at home alone without breakfast is part of the reason i choose to wake up late. LOL....&nbsp; but you know, im kinda scare of oil splattering around and i think i am allergic to detergent when it comes to washing up the dishes. (seriously, my hands will have ""breakout"" if i 'm expose to a lot of detergent and stuff like that. Nice) 

Yea so, thats it. Right now i hope Starhub will call me to tell me i'm being recruited. :) Is my first choice now!!!"

Initially was wanting to rent the dress, however after corine opinion on that she wants to purchase the dress because she wants take family picture with her brother whose gonna like graduate 6 yrs later?! lol Then i thought of jack and qiu min! Jack is graduating next year as he is doing honors while min gonna take another 3 yrs, so i might as well buy and keep so i can take nice nice studio photos with them! yey!&nbsp;

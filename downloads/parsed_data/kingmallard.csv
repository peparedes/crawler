"event","kinda funny- today is the first day in about 3 months where i have had free time where i have very few tasks weighing on my shoulders. i got 3 big things done today- i got the proces for selling my broken car in motion, to be sold wednesday, i did the final walkthrough for our old apartment, so i never have to go back there, and i put all the bills in my name for our new place, so that is off my chest. also, we streightened out all the money matters in m house, and payment got started. so right now, the only thing weighing on my mind is school. and i only orked an hour today. 

but i feel like shit. i have this pit in my stomach like i havnt accomplished anything or that there isnt anything for me to be doing. i am feeling very unaccomplished when i should feel very proud that i got all this shit done. but i dont. an now im sitting here feeling werid on livejournal"

but you cannot be a different person in a different place as there will be no catalyst for change, but when you stay at the same place, you hate who you are.

a troubling problem.

why are some people so disgusted with who they are? cant you be happy being you? is there some person that you dont see in the mirror that you thought was there?

"event","there is this horrible feeling in my stomach. its like awkward, but 10000 times worse. why is it there?

there is no reason.

please note that the inflection in my voice is one that is matter of fact. sorta with indignation at the fact that i feel like this. i just saw man of the year, should be called awkward 3 hours of the year, with jenna and her friend who is friends with kari. and i saw her, and that was awkward 3 hours of my life. and i worked today with this kid named leonard. for about 3 hours i worked. he is as awkward as his name sounds. 

so ive had 9 total hours of awkwardness packed into one night

and im indignanat at this feeling. 

the only reason im putting this here is because its such a stupid time to be feeling this way. if i was actually sad, or upset, i would talk to someone, but because its like i jammed a spoon up my ass, im confused. i feel like lewis black, who was in the movie, and was funny...

dude, i just realized. that awkard feeling, is me being really really hungry

i havnt eaten since 2 today. and its 1. not like im starvin marvin, but maybe 10000 times awkward is really just 11 hours of no food. wow. now i feel better

ha

this just happened. 

lasst week, my work had me convinced that my name was JonathOn, not JonathAn, like it actually is. how did they do that? my paycheck. thus far, an employer has yet to get all of my information correct. bennigans thought i was at APT# 151 and my middle name was R. sdsu bookstore thought my apt# was 111, and now jonathOn. who the fuck wants to be called jonathOOOOOOOn like a fucking bird call or something.

fuck am i hungry. i work in 8 hours. i want 8 hours of sleep. fuck you hunger. fuck you awkwrd movie and experience. fucking chuck norris. 

its been like 4 months since ive writen anything and this is your god damn update"

"event","let me say that kelsey, i appreciate your apology a grewat deal. thank you. i cant wait for your life to be better in sac. this message is not about you. im not pissed at you. or anyone who will read this. the only reason im putting this here is because i hate posting shit on myspace that is of any consequence because it is too accecible and meaningless. not to say that it isnt meaningless here, but at least it is contained to a select few, especially those who i dont care if they read this. if nicki and aubrey could read this, it wouldnt be here. and i want to rant about them right now
<lj-cut text=""jon is cool"">

nicki is a fucking bitch. she uses her fucking pms as an excuse to be a bitch. i am completely and totally sympathetic to girls that are irritable, uncomfortable, unnaproachable, or unhappy when the lining of part of their body is shed in a bloody mess, but in no way is that a reson to be a bitch. there is no reason to be a bitch. why does nicki think that she can beat the shit out of me and have me be fine with it. im not her fucing boyfriend. i dont have to take that shit. she bit me on my hand when we were screwing around. the palm of my hand. she was saying something that i dont remember and i covered her mouth to stop her. she started biting me. i didnt move my hand, thinking that she would stop. she bites harder, and i think she will stop. she bites harder, and i think she will stop. she starts to grind her teeth, and i still keep my hand there, thinking that she couldnt possibly think i am enjoying this and im trying to make a point. i eventually have to move my hand, for fear of having part of my skin bitten off. it looked as though it had been caguht between a vice, white and dead looking. today, it is bright red. who the fuck does that? who the fuck bites and bites and doesnt stop? she said she was sorry then and said she didnt realize it hurt...


huh?


fuck you


of course it hurt

you were biting me

how could you be that stupid

shit like that happens all the time when im hangoing out with nicki

i get hurt and she laughs

and i asked her to stop

(14:43:53) mightykingmalard: everytime i see you i end up in pain
(14:44:12) mightykingmalard: in some way shape or form
(14:46:30) mightykingmalard: so how about lightening up on beating the shit outta me
(14:46:44) mightykingmalard: at least in ways that most likely will cause actual pain
(14:46:59) mightykingmalard: please
(14:48:19) Nicki has gone away.

no responce

she went away

i closed her responce 20 minutes later, when i was gone, and it went something like this:

""i didnt break your computer (of which i never accused her of). if your friends are such a detriment to you, why have them? stop freaking complaining about your life. why have you been so weird lately? im pmsing and i dont want to deal with your moodyness. ive told you im freaking sorry so be over it. the last 7 outta 10 times ive talked to you, youve picked fights with me and im tired of it. im pmsing and i dont want to deal with it, so be over it.""

i responded:

""wow... id get mad, but you arent worth it""

i am mad

but im not going to let her win by taking some immature stab back at her on an aim conversation. thats stupid. and immature. instead, ill be immature and write about how pissed i am on this fucking thing. that way someone sees it and you dont get to know i did it. fucking bitch

and stop using pms to rip into me.

use some restraint. i dont use my sexual frustration (which i will get into in a minute) to be an ass to you. please not, sexual frustration is a joke and you will get it by the end of this. 

maybe if you didnt treat me like shit, i wouldnt be uneasy talking to you. get a boyfriend to beat the shit out of. you dont hurt eric. you dont hurt derek. you dont hurt jeff.

stop being so shallow, impulive, and immature. if you act like a bitch, expect someone to tell you about it. 

shit. im losing rage and i havnt gotten to aubrey.

well, aubrey and i had this conversation:

(21:06:30) Aubrey: you have friends that are girls
(21:06:38) Aubrey: me laura nicki nicole
(21:06:59) mightykingmalard: yeah
(21:06:59) mightykingmalard: true
(21:07:02) mightykingmalard: but other than that
(21:07:05) mightykingmalard: you know all of htem
(21:07:19) Aubrey: well you dont talk to any other girls
(21:07:29) Aubrey: ?
(21:07:39) mightykingmalard: in what situations?
(21:07:45) Aubrey: i dunno
(21:07:51) Aubrey: from classes going out etc
(21:07:54) mightykingmalard: i talk to no one during class
(21:07:57) Aubrey: from the dorms
(21:07:59) mightykingmalard: i rarely go out
(21:08:03) mightykingmalard: i hated the dorms
(21:08:11) Aubrey: well thats how i made new friends
(21:08:17) mightykingmalard: oh
(21:08:19) Aubrey: thats your problem
(21:08:23) mightykingmalard: your dorms werent a buch of asshoels
(21:08:25) Aubrey: you need to network
(21:08:25) mightykingmalard: wow
(21:08:30) Aubrey: i dunno
(21:08:31) mightykingmalard: glad you figured that one out
(21:08:34) mightykingmalard: lol
(21:08:35) mightykingmalard: sorry
(21:08:41) Aubrey: my dorm had a lot of assholes
(21:08:41) mightykingmalard: that was unneccassry
(21:08:52) Aubrey: youre so mean tonight
(21:09:00) mightykingmalard: im sorry
(21:09:01) Aubrey: i think its due to sexual frustration
(21:09:09) mightykingmalard: umm...
(21:09:14) mightykingmalard: i guese
(21:09:23) mightykingmalard: how do you figure that?
(21:10:01) Aubrey: because guys are usually a lot less tense after they get some kind of action
(21:10:13) Aubrey: it doesnt even have to be sex
(21:10:17) mightykingmalard: oh
(21:10:19) Aubrey: just making out will do it
(21:10:19) mightykingmalard: well
(21:10:29) mightykingmalard: ...
(21:10:33) mightykingmalard: alllright
(21:11:07) mightykingmalard: i dont think thats my problem
(21:11:07) Aubrey: maybe when laura and i come to sd we'll hire a hooker for youi
(21:11:11) mightykingmalard: oh
(21:11:12) mightykingmalard: thanks
(21:11:16) mightykingmalard: that will brighten my day
(21:11:17) Aubrey: then what is your problem
(21:11:19) Aubrey: lol
(21:11:28) mightykingmalard: ummm
(21:11:33) mightykingmalard: the fact that i dont give a shit
(21:11:39) mightykingmalard: i dont fucking know
(21:11:50) mightykingmalard: now im getting a little irratated
(21:11:52) mightykingmalard: im sorry
(21:11:59) mightykingmalard: i dont want to be mean to you
(21:12:31) Aubrey: oh jon
(21:12:40) Aubrey: what will make you feel better?
(21:12:47) mightykingmalard: hmm
(21:12:52) Aubrey: i didnt mean to upset you?
(21:12:52) mightykingmalard: no having this conversation?
(21:12:56) mightykingmalard: lol
(21:13:11) mightykingmalard: if sexual frustration is my problem, its been my problem for a long time
(21:13:19) mightykingmalard: i dont really think that that rules my life
(21:13:21) Aubrey: ok we'll start having another conversation
(21:13:22) mightykingmalard: in fact, i know it doenst
(21:13:29) mightykingmalard: if it did, id fuck the first thing that i could
(21:13:30) mightykingmalard: but
(21:13:32) mightykingmalard: i dont
(21:13:40) mightykingmalard: so i must not be sexually frustarated
(21:14:11) Aubrey: jon calm down
(21:14:16) mightykingmalard: dude
(21:14:20) mightykingmalard: im perfectly calm
(21:14:25) mightykingmalard: im being matter of fact
(21:15:07) Aubrey: jon lets go to a happy place
(21:15:15) mightykingmalard: hahaha
(21:15:16) Aubrey: im going to say that happy place is anchorman
(21:15:20) Aubrey: or dodgeball
(21:15:26) mightykingmalard: hahaha
(21:15:28) mightykingmalard: alright
(21:15:37) Aubrey: if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball

who says that to a friend?

ill get you a hooker and solve your sexual frustration...

wow

you whore

you can go to hell

""im single and all these boys like me but i dont like any of them and i think you shouldnt be sexually frustrated""

thats essentially what she said to me in a different conversation

single girls should never say a guy deserves a girlfriend nor should they say they should get a hooker. 

its kinda like ""quit offering someone else to me""

thats a stupi thinkg to say.

and maddening.

and you have to be pretty comfortable with someone to tellthem they are sexually frustrated.

if you knew me, youd know that i am not.

if i was sexually frustrated, i would find a way to frelieve said frustration. and at sdsu, it wouldnt be too hard. i cant believe she would be that presumptuous. and then be so shallow as to say that.

how could she think that was funny

</lj-cut>

i hope i did that right"

1. I find out that the car i am supposed to get will only be available (maybe) on the day im supposed to go to SD and help derek unload my stuff. I will have to go down later than he is and unload what i can when i get there.

2. I find that one of my best friends, in an absence from them, has changed into something i feared they could always become: completely shallow and forgetful of what is important, neither caring for her hometown nor axxepting that there are any people in there that mean anything to her. also, it becomes clear that she has always been actually shallow, rather than what i concieved as ignorance or innocence.

3. It becomes clear that one of my friends is only staying with their other for rent money, with a simple comment like ""at least you have someone you like to talk to."" i realize this, but know that there is nothing i can do, as this information is probably already suspected by the second party.
         on a second note to this statement, couples that break up after a long time at age 18 or 19 should remain broken up, as the possibility that the reasons for breaking up were changed arew slim to none.

4. Everytime a guy finds a girl, it becomes a shock for his friends that someone else will be taking up some of their time with. this isnt a selfish realization, as we all understand, but it is still obvious when it happens that a change has happened.

5. I got into a debate about a stupid, insignificant observation in a movie. When sise ""A"" convinces me of his validity, i find that the debators on side ""B"" will relentlessly bash side ""A"" if he does not have any support, and i try ruthlessly to convince side ""B"" in to our opinion, not so much for my own satisfaction, but for the protection of my friend. after some time, it is agreed that side ""A"" was correct, but only after side ""B"" tried to discredit our reasoning. its now easy to see that if you cant baet em, try to find a flaw in their reasoning, or give them an alternative reason for why they are correct.
         on a second note to this statement, after successfully prooving my point, i felt no vindication or fullfillment over winning and protecting my friend, only childish and ignorant for arguing in the first place, further making me see that i can not stand being on only one side of an argument, meaning i would be a terrible debater.

6. Dont get pissed when i dont have something fun on the tip of my mind to do. it has never been my job to entertain with group activities.

7. So melanie ellefson has had sex before some of us. to the two people that cant have sex because of religion, it was a big deal. to me, i could care less. if you dont want to be a virgin, dont be religious. other than that, its not a big deal.

8. I \kinda realize that when i get drunk, i say what i really feel. maybe thats why i get drunk.

9. Basically i dont fucking care about most people anymore. as the days creep closer, i am more and more anxious to go back where i can read all of this when i choose to, not deal with it right in my fucking face. 

To those of you who may get offended by all this, dont. because in times of bad days, ive read your BS directed at others or me and not taken it seriously."

"event","so i think i need to get a 76% on my final to get a 70% in the class

**PROOF**

given: total points as of May 9 = 400, total of points jon has as of may 9 = 250, final test will be 40 % of final grade.

Points available on test = 40/100 = x/(400+x)
                           = 16000+40x = 100x
                           = 16000 = 60x
                           = 266.67

Total points in class after final = 666.67 (Ironically, damn stanic italian calc teacher, i knew he was evil)

Points required for 70% = 666.67*.70
                        = 466.69

Points i need to earn for 70% = 466.67-250
                              = 216.67

Percent i need on final to get 216.67 class points = 216.67/266
                                                   = 81.4%

Added fact = one test will be given 15 points leway, so i waill be given 15 more points, thus, 265 is the total points before final. 216-15 = 201, 201/266 = 76%

this whole calculatio is dependant on the fact dependant variable that i havnt missed more than 6 days of class, thus making the test that i missed doubled with the final. if total missed days > 6, Jon = fucked. if total missed days < 6, jon = maybe not fucked. if total missed days = 6, jon doenst know what happens and hopes. Jon thinks that total missed days < 6, but is not sure

if you actually read this whole thing, im proud (lauren, im not proud of you because you shiuld already be able to do all this, but maybe just a little proud)

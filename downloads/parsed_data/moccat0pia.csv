"event","today has been so great. i came to school in pajamas and my warmup jacket so i was already happy in the morning. and THEN i had a bagel with strawberry cream cheese and because i hardly ever eat breakfast, i call this noteworthy. english was fine, we continued the crucible. i got bored with being frustrated and i actually slept for a good 20 minutes. 

humanities almost fucked up my morning, but i tried not to let it. ms lamey was being a huge penis today for some reason, but everyone has their days. at cocurricular, candace, ryan, and i walked around the second floor for our miles. we decided that because we're around each other so much, there are times where we literally run out of things to talk about. then spanish was a lot of fun because candace, amber, vaidehi, and i sang our retarded song and laughed our asses off for some reason. 

gym was insanely fun and funny. omg. so we played volleyball again. last time (you would know if livejournal didn't eat my blog.), i taught the class for the first time because ms e is pretty lazy and we both knew she wouldn't be able to teach us about volleyball anyway. and it was a lot of fun last time, even though alyssa wasn't there 'cause she definitely would've helped. so THIS time it was better 'cause they had some idea how to play. they still giggle and make fun of me when i say ""shag the ball"" or ""shake it off."" crazy kids.

today though, sanservino and lerner were there and ms e spent pretty much all her time watchin' her boiz baLL it Up. meh.

then we played a game! yay! haha. i love my class because we're so small (17 kids) and we all pretty much get along. there's no a-hole who ruins the atmosphere. so my team (nora, donasia, kristine, ariyan, mike, chris, and sanservino) kicked the other team's (candace, ryan, nidhi, rob, sean, lisa, alyssa, peng, and lerner) asses. i served like 11 balls in a row so that kind of started things off. haha. but i was soooo happy with how everyone played. donasia had ACES! and i knew she was freaking out 'cause she played volleyball with sanservino, her stalkee. lol. 

personal highlights of the game: finding out that sanservino sucks balls at volleyball since we could have won easily without him.. lisa being fantastic and chucking the ball at his balls.. lerner crackin on him about his free, mailed-in sweatshirt.. that really really really good rally that we had going.. donasia's ace.. sean serving.. and me fucking up a fairly easy bump. gosh it's so fun to go back to ""gym volleyball."" hahaha i'm a volleyball supremacist. alyssa's team (rahway) is playing in the tourney tomorrow too. i wonder how their JV is.

when we got back to the fitness center, i called ryan a faggot and lerner kind of scolded me for not being ""tolerant."" hahahahahahahaha. gosh i'm not a freakin homophobe. that's just my pet name for ryan. fag. hahahah. oh man. ""we have you teach you guys about tolerance!"" oh lerner.

the bus ride home was interesting. felix was being such a freakin nerd. so i yelled at him. gosh i'm that kid's only hope in straightening him out. practice was hilarious. i didn't play 'cause bernie needed to practice for tomorrow, so i spent all of practice on the sidelines. me, martyqua, riza, ashley, gail, and tolu were all dancing, dry humping, and hurting each other in very stupid ways. i'm gonna miss them sooooo much tomorrow. 

after practice i saw maria and kristen and they attacked me, pushed me to the ground, and raped me. we all had sex hair afterwards. 

after that my brother came and we went to pathmark to get some food for tomorrow, bestbuy to finally buy gil his present, and i got a mango bubble ""smoothie"" from ponz's place. it's not tea, it's like a smoothie with sago (filipino word for ""bubbles""). he said that joy said i could call her up and she'd come pick me up so i could sleep over at her dorm at rutgers whenever i wanted to. OMG what an awesome friend. i think of her as an older sister now because she's the closest to a sister that i have.

i still have to pack and clean up my room and get the digicam from my dad. i guess i'm pretty excited. i just hope it doesn't disappoint. i'll blog on sunday!"

You are The Beatles, They were the most popular rock group in the quickest amount of time in the 60's and well into today..you only toured for a couple of years and the screaming fans made your music impossible to be heard. You are loved and made a huge change in rock history and music forever. You will never be forgotten!:]<p><b><a href=http://www.greatestjournal.com/quiz.bml?Q=777>What 60's rock band are you?

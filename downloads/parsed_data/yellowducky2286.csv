everything you possible can 
on the stage and in the 
lightbooth"" day.It was pretty fun
Some people were really 
bitchy on what to do, but 
other people were nice 
and having a fun time today
i think this year is 
drama will be awesome! Pretty
much everyone is really 
nice, this Kid was like 
"" OMG i think i know you!"" 
and i was like mabye and
he was like obsessing 
over if he knew me or 
not the whole time, but it 
was okay, cuz he was 
pretty cool he was very ganster
and was like "" wouldnt it be cool 
if we were all ganster? and
stuff like that, haha. Then 
Derek and Cole and some other people 
I dont know that well were like 
attacking each other with different
props and stuff, pretty funny. 
Then Kevin threw this deformed 
apple at me and he took a 
rubber banana and we played
 baseball :-P haha then he threw the
banana at Derek. Amamnda was 
like obessing on killing 
me with this toy gun and was 
like bam your dead haha yes im soo happy, 
shes wired.lol Then like the whole rest 
of the time Kevin and I were talking about 
the kids at Lakewood and like how much 
we wanted to kill them some more 
and make them do work and then we 
talked about like each one of them 
and like say something about them 
that they did of what problems they had
it was fun. I think Drama this year 
will be fun but mabye a little wired

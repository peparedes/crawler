"event","Hey whats up. I've decided that I will recognize the audience that reads this and write in the proper context. I'm back at Denison, and everything's going. Not bad, not good, just going. I'm running for DCGA president (ha!) and am trying to get a radio show. I miss my brother's and family very much. I've also decided to come out and let it be known that I want to be a writer. From now on, no more evasive answers about my future. And in other news, a relationship has been cancelled. I am pleased for the parties invovled, well at least the one I know and am friends with. I'm going to eat lunch with Eric Hanson tomorrow. That should be fun. I've decided to give up facebook and AIM for lent. Drop me a line at 740.587.8400 if you want to. And yes, I use the european way of writing numbers. I also joined a writing group. Taylor House @ 10:oo pm on tuesdays. Stop by, I invite you to. Not much else going on so it's time to sign off.
Later,
Christopher"

"event","I took my youngest brother, Andrew, to preschool today. He started to cry when I told him I had to leave. It was just ""one of those moments"". 

In other news, I spoke with someone I havn't had contact with in almost eight years. It was very pleasant and we ended up having a very interesting conversation about politics. It is nice to speak with old friends every once in a while. 

I also started work on a new song today, which I will call ""I Don't Know What Love Is"". It came to me while I was working in the Dairy cooler at Kroger's.

And Kansas sucks big donkey dick in case you didn't know.

Here is some of my new song.

""I didn't think it true
I never did believe
Until I saw you babe,
Angels just were dreams"""

"event","Hey, I wonder if anyone at all reads this page. If you do let me know, my aim name is the same as this one. Lots of things happened today, but none of any real importance. I got up. I drove around. Ate Mcdonald's. Shipped a print and paid more for shipping than what was paid to me. Went to sign up for a motorcycle permit and am going to take it on wednesday. Then I went to work and then went to work out. I am having trouble finding a good exercise to work my legs. I am convinced that my left leg is a little bit longer than my right one, and on top of that I have periodic lower back pain. I feel like my legs are being ignored. I'll try deadlifts tomorrow. And I finally decided on my New Year resolutions. They are to- 1. Get a girlfriend. 2. Loose lots of weight/get really buff/ look really hot. They aren't a walk in the park, but I think I'll manage. Well, thats about it for today. 

""No, I'm not afraid of dying. What scares me the most, more than anything else in this world, is not finding something to loose. Of this, I am terrified."""

"event","This saturday I got off of work at Kroger's to travel 220 miles to Owingsville, where I graduated High School. I hadn't seen any of my friends who live there in over seven months. Well, I got there all right and played paintball as planned (thank God it didn't rain) It was good to see all of the old friends. It is different now. I am the only one who left, who went away to college, and it seems as if they feel I abandoned them. In a way, I did. I love that place, it is so very beautiful, but it is also so very sad, full of broken hearts and dreams. It was good to see everybody though. I also got to see Ryan. I think things aren't going to well for him. It felt as if we have grown distant, which in all realities, we have. He has changed alot, but outward appearances really don't mean that much. I love college and he hates it. He goes home every weekend and I want to stay as long as I can. I don't know. I just think that if things were different, if things had happened any other way than the way they have, everything would be better. I won't ever be able to know, though. I don't want to sound mean or false or judgemental, or like I'm above everybody and have the authority to judge things, but Ryan's having a really tough time. I just wish things could be great for everybody. I just want things to work out, including my own problems. ""Lots of things are wrong, but the real problem is I can do so little to change anything."" I thought of a poem on the drive to o-ville, its not finished, but here are three stanza's, the two beginning ones and the ending.
""I once had a friend, a long time ago, the best in the world, full of the things real men are made of./But like my youth, he is now gone, they're memories now, ones I often think of./ and I'd ask him for help, because that's what friends are for, to open the window, when you can't find the door."""

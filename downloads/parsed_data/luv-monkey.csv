"event","I got the call today.  I got the job.  I start Monday.  Woohoo.  Don't know if I'll love it but it's a good start.  I'll be working at the same company as my husband and best friend.  HA! I complain that I don't spend enough time with Dan....well now I've asked for it.  The hours are decent.  The pay is pretty good.  Now the dream of getting a house can come true."

"event","Why the hell am I not sleeping??  Last night I slept from 10:30 to 2 and 3 to 5.  The previous....10:30 to 12 and 5 to 6:30.  Pathetic.  Thank God I'm not babysitting.  No Sleep means no No Nice.

Still waiting for the call confirming I have a job.  This is scary.  I've had no responses from any of my backups either.  I thought I had a decent resume but apparently not.  Also still waiting to see what Dan's going to be doing at his job.  HIs bosses have hinted that he'll get the promotion but no final word on that either.  Limbo Limbo.  I'm worried about money....I haven't even bought winter coats for my kids yet....what a schmuck.  Then of course there's christmas.  Dan says everything will work out the way it's supposed to.....We have certainly survived and had a decent christmas on a lot less income.

Blah Blah Blah"

"event","Had my last day of babysitting.  I'm worried.  Watching Chelle's kids was a way to stay connected to her.  Saw her five days a week.  It looks like I'll be working at the same company as her but in a different dept.  won't be the same.  I wrote her a card with a list of ways to stay connected.  Ya know, we give eachother pedicures, family dinners together, we already have football parties at her house, girls night out with dinner and a movie, dessert trips to denny's, stuff like that.  It wouldn't normally be a problem....but I'm feeling a double whammy happening.  I'm starting the new job and Chelle's sister has moved here to take over my old job...and is moving 3 houses down from her....it's got me maybe a bit jealous.  Maybe a lot.  But I did meet her sister last night.  She is nice.  Scary how much she looks like Chelle.  Imagine the neighbors....mass confusion."

"event","I finally got the call confirming I have a job.  But it seems their HR dept is holding up the process.  I'm praying I start soon.  Christmas is almost here....and well hey, gotta pay rent.  Still gotta decide what to do about my Shane, he's not old enough to stay alone.  Even though Sheila is home in an hour.  He's a sneaky little shit.  Gotta love some of the shit he gets into though.  It's odd, I find myself having a double standard where my kids are concerned.  I let him get away with more....he knows it too...out of them both he'll be my teenage troublemaker.  Of course it won't be a picnic with Sheila, she's just like me and YUCK I don't want to deal with myself.  Things could get ugly."

"event","So I'm almost to the end of watching my best friends kids.  Watching them has been good.  I'm sooooo ready to move on though.  The 2 yr old.....devil's spawn.  Her  mother agrees.  We figured it out.  I'm her second mother and I've watched her since she was 2 weeks old.  How could she not be a nasty bitch with Chelle and I as her mothers.  When she was first born we thought....how cute.  She has my dimple and my same birthmark.  Well shit, she has a combo temper of her mother and I.  A double whammy!!  Her poor daddy.  She had this look on her face today.  It was some sort of fire breathing dragon/linda blair thing.  She reared back with this monster look on her face and I swore any second fire would shoot out of her mouth as her head started spinning.  She's always been high maintenence.  Last year I named her Francis....after the hurricane.  It's only gotten worse.

I started searching for singing lessons online last night.  Not much to be had in Charlotte.  I also searched in the free mag...Creative Loafing....for any bands that might need a singer....nothing.  But it's occuring to me that I do have a dream.  I can't really talk my hubby into it though and it's not something I want to do solo.  I want to take ballroom dancing....or salsa or something.  Dirty Dancing movie moves.  I want it bad.  God, I could be sexy!  But imagine the cardio workout....healthy heart, sexy body.....yeah it'd be fun.

Got a call from Allan today.  Wonder why whenever I talk to him anymore he sounds bored shitless.  We used to be so close.  He sounded excited about talking to Dan....atleast they still have their bond.  I think ours changed the last time Dan and I seperated.  He flat out said...I choose Dan.  Wanted nothing to do with me then....guess it hasn't changed.  I always found it beautiful that we did have a friend, that's you Shan, that didn't take sides.  She loved us both and listened to us both and didn't break the trust of either of us.  To have a friend like that is something incredibly special.  Thank you.  Anyway with Allan...he has twins now, a smart wife and he's still just wanting to play with cars....typical Allan.  He sounded bored with his life too....maybe it was that he didn't want to talk to me but Dan.  Screw him.  Dan needs him....Dan needs more friends...Dan needs to keep the friends he has.  As long they are still brothers of the heart, that's what counts.  

I got a call from Martha today too.  I'm feeling disconnected from the TV show.  It was fun while I was doing it.  What's wrong with me?  I'm on a weekly show.  People look forward to hearing me sing each week.  I should be trying to do something with that.  I feel like I'm running away from it.  I don't want to do that.  I need to dive back into it.  The host offered his home studio to make a CD.  That could be good.  HAHA...christmas presents.  And everyone who loves me would be obligated to go on an on about how great it is.  Even better....he said he might do a dvd of us singing...They like me, they really really like me......right? HA!!"

"event","I was beginning to despair.  I had interviewed last week for a position and felt it had gone really well.  But no call for a week now.  A little bird told me that I basically did get the job, just waiting on a glitch.  Thank God!  I have never interviewed and not gotten a job from it.  I seem to interview well for some reason.  I feel like an ass while I am interviewing but it comes off well.  I don't seem to have a lot of self-confidence.  Which some could argue...I mean I tape a weekly variety show and recieve a lot of complimentary calls about my voice.  I think I must have put it into some part of my brain as not holding a lot of importance.  That seems to work....I'm no longer nervous singing in front of people.  I know I have talent.  Mu husband gets angry at me because I don't do something with that talent.  I'm 34...what the hell am I going to do with it anyway.  Not only am I 34 but I'm not some supermodel that will wow people enough to notice me.  I was once asked why I'm not recording...by a DJ.  I said the above to him.  He promptly came back with a way to get into it.  A christian album.  I was flattered but you don't see me running to a studio either.  It's a nice dream....maybe if I had a push.  I don't have the guts to put myself out there.  I don't take criticism well....who does.

God what a rambling load of crap.  I bore myself.  I need a life.  My husband, trying to win an argument, commented that I have no interests.  I don't remember the argument but I do remember that comment.  I do have interests.  I read.  I sing.  But you can only get a fix from karaoke for so long before you're bored.  I've read and reread the authors and books that I like.  I need a new hobby.  I need more friends.  I have one friend where I live.  That friend has 4 kids.  HOw much time does she have for me?  Not much.  I cook to relieve boredom.  I guess I can be glad that I don't eat most of what I cook so I'm not gaining weight with all this boredom. I get irritated doing housework to relieve the boredom.  How pathetic....are you bored? Clean Clean Clean.  Great...I've bored myself stupid."

"event","On a memorable drinking night....atleast I think it was memorable....nope....but it sure was fun!  My best friend and I drank at least 5 shots of Tequila...and these were mini bottle shots (1.75 oz) so hey! more fun...it was more like 9 shots......whhheeeeeeee!  This night was much better than the other 9 shot tequila night.  That night is a blur except for the last thing I heard that night....from the bouncer ""Excuse me Miss, I need to escort you off that table.""  So on my 5 shot night, my best friend and I were dancing and karaoking and somehow (this seems to be the part I forget) we were reborn the Love Monkeys....I'm thinking of getting it in a tattoo.....nevermind that I'm too chicken for a tattoo.

I do think this is the perfect time to begin a journal....This week starts my quest for a new job, I'm a little scared.  I've been doing daycare for my best friend and her 4 children for the last 2 years.  My last job before this was the best job...and I quit to stay home with my kids.  Now it is time to rejoin the work force....so we can get a house....a house all our own....it could really happen.  We have a goal.  House by the end of summer.  A place where our kids can play and we make a neighborhood of friends.  Neighbors that being you a plate of cookies when you move in...neighbors that have nice children that don't have potty mouths worse than mine....what a nice dream!

So I found this journal by looking for a long lost friend.  She has a journal here....it looked like a good place to relieve tension.  And I have a feeling I'll need to do that during this transitional period."

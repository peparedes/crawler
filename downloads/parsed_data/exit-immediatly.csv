"event","well, UW is pretty cool.  i like the campus though i still haven't decided how it will fit into everything if it will at all.  give it 2 weeks and the hype of UW will die down.  i don't even know if i can get in.  so i met a ton of new people from all over the state.  tons of latino boys...=)  ok...homecoming was a blast!  i'm soooo glad i could go.  it was rocky at first, but after the time warp i frankly said screw my reserves.  i saw the one person i can't stand there and successfully managed to avoid her the entire night.  yay!"

tashy is going off to college and so did candace!  where did all the time go?!?  it seems like yesterday we were jumping rope in the street and watching all the old starwars in candace's basement.  where did all the time go?  what did we do in between that time and now?  i just wish we could go back and redo those days to make them even better, but no.  we are all moving on and leaving.  i know i won't ever be friends with them again because we will grow too distant and just never cross paths again.  it is just hard to watch them leave...i didn't even say good-bye to candace, and tasha, good-bye through an email isn't what i would have wanted.  why is it so soon, why does this happen to everybody?"

on the bright side, there are a ton of spanish exchange students here so i can talk to them...
also i am making some ""friends"" with some nice people.  i know i'm not seeing them ever again, so they remain acquaintances/""friends.""

my cousin is here from tj...he is pretty funny and i like hanging out with him...we leave at midnight tonight to pick up my aunt and other cousin...i can't stand my other cousin...she is so much like katie and gina and i am so different from them...ah well...so tonight is going to be a supper long night.  they will be here for a week and then i'm leaving for a program at WWU and then i'll be home for the rest of the summer.  so it'll be a good rest of the summer.

i am on such an artistic kick right now.  i've never even expressed an interest in making art, but this summer, maybe i'm just bored, but i've been painting everything, even my wall.  i've been drawing and coloring, but i enjoy painting the best.

because of my good grades i got a cd...the system of a down steal this album...nothing else really appealed to me because i didn't really want whole cds, i just wanted select songs.  ah well...and then since my cd was so cheap i got headphones too because my other ones were shitty and broke with in 6 months.

so i'm having a good time so far."

"event","yay...so i'm hanging out with tashy on wednesday!  that is good...i haven't seen her in a while and she's going off to college in 2 months!  ahh!!!  where has all the time gone!  it seems like we are still just little kids dreaming of going off to college eventually.  my back hurts soooooooo bad from painting furniture in the garage...fun.  today i was going to go to coldstone with my friends, but we, me and katie, ended up bowing out because their dad's chemo didn't go well and he was hospitalized.  i am really worried about that family.  i used to be really sad, but i am just worried now.  i hope he pulls through this, but this is one of his first chemos, if not the first, and if he is hospitalized, just think of all the times he will be in the hospital because he has months of this to do.  i'm so worried for their family, and candace is going to college.  i know i shouldn't be concerned about this, but i am because i've known that family for so long that i feel so useless and can only watch the whole family suffer...that is why i started crying in shop that one day when i welded.  i managed to stop myself from crying, thankfully, but i was still, almost instantly, depressed, and then i had to take a spanish final...it was probably the most stressful day this past year.  

enough of that.  

no, not enough, i can't talk to anyone about this...i need my melissy back!

ah well...maybe i can talk to cavan when he comes over tomorrow....i doubt i'll be able to talk to him about this, not that i can't talk to him, i just can't voice my feelings about this, i can write it down, i just can't say it....

i started working on summer homework...what a drag."

They are going to kill me; and its only 5 days in to summer...i finished White Oleander, for anyone who hasn't heard of it should watch the movie and then read the book.  they are both soooooooooo good.  =)  lately i've been sorting out a lot of things, but i end at no conclusions.  i don't know...it must be the dreary weather.  i don't know.  i am just glad we have a dog...she takes some attention away from me, especially when i do things wrong.  i came back from the park 20 minutes late.  i just can't seem to leave on time...i try...i even calculate the time to leave, but somehow i just can never follow through.  then on the way home i get stuck behind someone going 30 mph when the speed limit is 40.  it killed me...i could have only been 10 minutes late if i was free to go as fast as i could, but the idiot in front of me decided to drive like an older person. ah well...i need to work on that."

"event","well...i went on a walk yesterday and sorted out a lot of my
feelings...not all, but most.  it was a very good time, and by good i
mean that it was a valuable time.  thinking is always valuable.

i spent near 8 hours studying for my math final tomorrow.  not fun.

staying home from school today.  kinda fun.

i got pissed at my sister because she is a slob and i always end up
cleaning up after her...it just makes me angry.  i never have to clean
up after anyone else but her.  it seems she missed the message that
people clean up after themselves...she thinks she isn't going to the
waterfront after school...but she is...the parents just want her to
sweat it out.  i personally think it is completely immodest to parade
around in a bikini top and short little shorts...i just don't
understand how katie, at 15 years old, can possibly think that it is
acceptable to walk around and flirt around with boys while wearing
that.  she just is naive.  she doesn't know how guys think, neither do
i but i have a better idea than she does, it makes me almost ashamed
to see her do that.  she is just marketing her body, giving it for
attention from ""friends"" aka guys with thoughts that are not at all
what they want to think, but i just happens anyway for them.

anyway...katie is just making me annoyed and disgusted...just how she
says stuff, how she acts, how she thinks she understands things...she
is just so young still...i can't remember being that young...maybe
when i was 12, but not at 15.

i just needed to blow off steam..."

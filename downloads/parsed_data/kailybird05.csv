"event","so today was fantastic... definately havent updated in a while... i dunno well today i got my haircut so now i have bangy things...i like them... then briana came over and we went to mikes house, we watched shane alex mike and stewart play- they are sooo awesome! i was very impressed... my favorite songs are watch out alex screen door and artificial mystery flavor- ha what awesome names! and yeah so we listened to them and went completely def, then listened to alex and his stand up comedy-- it was the most fun ive had in a while- i felt so cool it was like our own private concert--- hehe shane and i were an emo couple for a little while... it was actually a little funny... then mike tried to be funny but that didnt work to well... but i still laughed hysterically because it was so gay... gosh- i really do like their music... i want to go see them again but alex said i could come watch once and i guess that was my once- harsh...

last night i had to babysit down the street for 2 kids for 6 hours and all i got was $25... that was a little upsetting considering i had to chase them around the house for an hour and lose at some hockey video game that was actually extremely cool.... 

anyway- after we left mikes, bri and i came to my house to study, didnt go so well, we went out to toojays and had some interesting conversations, josh and kris are so hilarious when their together- i love my brothers so much! then lets see... came back and studied some more, ran down my street and back then bri left and i... did something.... i dunno

ya know what... ive been in such bad moods lately... like nothing will make me happy and even if im doing something really fun, i wont have a good time, theres somethign seriously wrong with me because im always happy.. and now im not... i dont know what to do... but today i actually did have a good day, i wasnt like my normal self but i felt much happier---- but for some reason.. i feel like a few people are lying to me about some things... its really starting to piss me off... so just.. stop lying and tell me the truth, its much easier that way"

i really dont know why though im just super happy

last night when bri slept over, she went to sleep in the extra room so johnny and i 3 way called her and we were like talking then i snuck in her room and whatever... then she went to sleep and i talked with johnny until like 4:30 about all kinds of stuff like the difference between being pretty cute or sexy and how i give this one person special looks and he tried to explain that some people are cute and sexy at the same time and i said that wasnt true.. because it cant be like that... anyway i felt kinda bad tho because he said after he hung up with me he ate breakfast and like.. re-woke up... i slep though... lucky me. and lets see.. what else happened... today in math... was gay... then in history i had a blast.. i nominated leanne and alex for homecoming it was great.. and Ohhhh yes i voted for parker too!! yes! i saw him riding his bike the other day and we honked at him.. but then.. lets see... nothing happened... jason looks like he is from the 70's today its so cool... his hair is like parted and flipped out and its way 70 like... i get to go home with bri today which is great because i love her... oh yeah! today is shane and my 7 month anniversary... i dont like that term i would prefer to say we have been going out for 7 months...  but yes im very excited about this because shane is like way so totally awesome and i love him very much... i was actually laying in bed the other night thinking about it and it was like woah.. but i dont know... 

gosh bri im rambling on just for you because you wanted me too.. wow you should feel special..... ""hey kris wanna go to wendys??"" ""no."" ha random thought

last night i came to this realization and it was very dissapointing.. it bothers me how some people act different when its just you or when theres more people around... shouldnt it be that you are yourself all the time? gosh its like insane the difference in some people... but whatever i guess its not my problem...

corey def got me hooked on these songs... its exciting. i listen to them all the time now

ya know what i think is really cool? how sometimes you wont talk to a person for a really long time and then when you do, its like nothing has changed between the two of you. and when like you think a certain way of someone and you might not like them but then you get to know them and learn that they really are nice people... 

well i think i should go take a shower before i start to smell"

O MAN i forgot! guess what! i have a pizza lunchables for lunch! heck yes.

dinner was so much fun last night with bri she was so hyper. it was great. and then. ya know, bri and i were discussing what we would be like if we had never met each other. she decided she wouldnt know jason or johnny or any of them like that. and she would be real shy. and i we have decided, would be exactly how i was in 7th grade. ha. so much entertainment. we have also decided that my hair has gone thru the most changes within our friends. 

gosh im so jealous. shane is eating pizza. i want to eat mine now but i will wait. im so hungry. o hey in the car this morning was so fun. i put on oldies and my dad like freaked out and he turned it up all loud and we were singing and it was just so great-normally he hates the stuff i listen to but i was in a great mood because of my shower so i decided to put on some real tunes.

ha im in such a good mood! and i get to go home with briana today. and we get to go to see the guy at the place to get the thing. then were gonna go for a bike ride! yey. to subway we go! maybe our good buddy michael will be there. even tho, he was no fun last time. its ok. i forgive him. bri said we were fugitives from the hurricane so i can understand his attitude towards us. 

peachy!

yesterday was weird. i went to brianas house and we studied. we talked about all kinds of stuff. i love briana so much. then her mom took us to wendys. then we went to the football game to watch johnny. jason erin and shane were there. shane was mean to briana.

we got to run in the rain. we waited for johnny outside the locker room. johnny and i ran through the halls. it was so cool. i talked to his dad. we had an interesting conversation. 

we took bri home and after she got out of the car my mom got mad at me. she was pissy. its ok though. cuz she loves me.

i got home and i talked to jason online for a sec. then shane called and we talked. i felt bad though. cuz he was like mad at me earlier. then he had to go do his homework. then i wasnt in a good mood. i called johnny. i told him make me feel better. he did. good job. 

bri can always make me feel better. she is like the coolest person ever. gosh. heck yes. i colored her a picture yesterday of carebears. i felt like a loser. i knew what color all of them were supposed to be. 

daniels making fun of me. cuz i went hhmmigiihhhdh. i dont think im in a good mood right now. i was last period. cuz werthman makes me laugh. he was like showing us how they rode horses. it was sexual and gross. bri gave me a look. then i laughed at him. hes a freak. i find it funny.

then we had to go to the neighborhood block party where we saw chelsea and hung out with her...well i had to give dylan a piggy back ride all the way up and down the street and then all the little kids started attacking johnny with big sticks... there was like 100's of them all out to kill him... it was insane... then sean, steve, and jake came over... i played soccer with jimmy leighton and jacob which was really fun and then i sat and talked to chelsea, and the guys for a while... then johnny and bri left 

chelsea and i talked with jake for a real long time while steve and sean went to go take showers... hes such a cool guy... then they all came back and invited us to go hang out with them tonight

they left to go get steves car and ended up taking an hour so we couldnt go anywhere with them so we just hung out and talked for a bit... then made plans for tomorrow morning....

"event","so... this hurricane is suppossedly ""taking a break right now""  im talking to briana and johnny on the phone only its mostly silence because none of us have anything to say... we want to have a post hurricane party tonight but i highly doubt that will happen.... hmmm i have nothing to say... shane is sick... it makes me feel bad i hope he gets better soon... 

jason was mean to me today.. he said i was a bitch now... it made me very upset... then johnny was grrrr-ing at me all day because i laughed at him or something... 

briana says there is tornados everywhere... i dont think she knows what a tornado is because she sees them everywhere.... ""there was a tornado next door during the last hurricane... it touched down right next to our house and the wind was everywhere"" ""right after i left leannes there was this big tornado that touched down right in front os us"" she even sees them in her dreams..she is crazy.... what a funny girl... 

i cant wait to dye my hair... i find it so much fun... just to see it be different and everything even though the color i got is like the same thing that i have now... but i was too scared to get the darker one... 

wow were having such an interesting conversation about friday night... gosh everyone was angry that night cept for shane me erin leanne... actually that would mean only johnny and briana were angry... so nevermind forget i just said that....

ya know whenever bri me and johnny ride our bikes together, johnny always gets honked and yelled at like a bunch of times... bri and i get yelled at by old mexicans but johnny gets yelled at by all the hot guys and whatnot.... its quite strange... 

hmmm im going to go see if my mom will help me dye my hair now.. i doubt it but its worth a try... ew i think i smell right now because i havent taken a shower yet today... i have no intention to either... im quite satisfied sitting in my pajamas all day.... but if we have our post hurricane party then i think i will need to wash up a bit.... 

well ok... i will update you on my facinating life later.... buhbye"

First I woke up at like 9 which was crazy in itself... Then I went to Briana's house to go on another bike ride with Erin Johnny Bri and myself... Yes well we went first to subway so i could eat then we went to mcdonalds so bri could eat... Johnny was causing problems and made everyone mad... Then he left to go to burger king and we chased him there... then we got milkshakes which were like really nasty... But anyway... lets see.. After that we went through woodlands to go back to brianas house... which was very fun cuz we got to go over the speedbumps and johnny and i tried to do this thing where i steered his bike and he steered mine... we almost fell over and died... But so after we got to brianas house we decided to go swimming but erin was tired so she went to take a nap... johnny got some pet rocks and we played with his hair then erin like came outside then left..... and we didnt know what to do so we sent johnny to go talk to her... well i dont know what happened down at the park but johnny was running and calling his brother and bri and i freaked out and in the midst of all this commotion i told bri a juicy secret.... which was really kinda random and bri and i couldnt help laughing at it... im such a loser but it was funny... then we went inside and watched the texas chainsaw massacre... we had like a 4 some on the floor of brianas den... with her dog... anyway not really we just all layed on the floor... gosh i hate that movie it scares me to death...  anyway after that we all left... then when i got home i ate spaghetti and talked to bri online.. she was being my shrink about my problem and she helped me out very much... i love you bri and then johnny and i had some very important serious conversations... it was really interesting... and very educational... we talked till like... 3 o clock with some interruptions in between... but it was great.. good stuff good stuff... anyway im not even tired bri and i are like running on adreniline as she calls it because neither of us got any sleep at all.... o well fun day good times... yep well thats all for now..."

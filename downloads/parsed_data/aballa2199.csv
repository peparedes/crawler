""Staring right back in the face
A memory can't be erased
I know, because I tried
Start to feel the emptiness
And everything I'm gonna miss
I know, that I can't hide

All this time is passing by
I think it's time to just move on

When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me
When you come around
I'll be there for you
Don't have to be alone with what you're going through

Start to breathe and fake a smile
It's all the same after a while
I know, that you are tired
Carrying the ones you lost
A picture frame with all the thoughts
I know, you hold inside

I hope that you can find your way back
To the place where you belong

When you come back down
If you land on your feet
I hope you find a way to make it back to me

You're coming back down
You say you feel lost can I help you find it
When you come around
From time to time we all are blinded
You're coming back down
You don't have to tell me what you're feeling
I know what you're going through
I won't be the one that lets go of you

I think it's time to just move on

"event","Recently, a lot of my friends and myself have been complaining about having bad days. Last week alone was in the work department of my life, miserable. I hated being there every second. It was like I was supposed to be somewhere else.  When you can't be where you should be, where you are becomes exhausting. So Friday night we celebrated. The celebration was fantastic, but there was still something missing. I guess you could say I've been in some sort of a funk lately.  

Now, as school has started yesterday, it seems like the days havent only been bad for me, but for everyone else too. We are all trying to situate ourselves in the new year, and most of us are trying to balance work and social lives at the same times. Friends don't have time for friends, work is the only place we ever are, and the stress of financial matters are putting people into tears.  Sure, in our lives right now, all of this seems to be the end of the world. It is all very dramatic and stressful.  But is it really that bad?

I am beginning to think that we all become so consumed in our own lives, our own happiness, our own little world that we become unaware of the world around us.  What prompted these thoughts in me are the pictures I've been seeing from Hurricane Katrina.  They are saying 80 people are possibly dead in one part of Mississippi.  One man is quoted as saying, ""I lost everything, I lost my wife and my house. I have nothing.""  I can not for the life of me understand this amount of loss and grief.  Yes, I have spent the last two nights crying over ridiculous things. Yes, I am a maniac for letting it affect me that much. Yes, I do feel incredibly stupid for feeling the way I have.  

Sometimes, I, as I'm sure many of you do too, stress over small insignificant things that appear to be important. I'm starting to realize that if you take a step back, look at the situation from an outsider stand point, and realize that there is hopefully always tomorrow to improve the situation, we should not spend our days as depressed as we have.  So starting today, I am not going to stress about things that can be changed, I'm going to let things happen, and stop letting anxiety take over.  I hope you can all do that too. I really honestly just want everyone dear to me to be happy."

"event","Ok, so I know that this is probably a really strange topic for a livejournal update, especially if you look at my past entries. All are very much introspective and based around current events in my life, or those that I love.  Very rarely is it about a national current event. But today as I was reading a newspaper article at lunch about the BTK killer in Kansas, I started to think about the families of those he killed.

First of all, as one could imagine, 99.9999% of this nations population probably sympathizes with those who lost a loved one because one utterly disgusting individual had a sick and disturbing sadomasochistic fantasy, that absurdly combusted because of an 11 year old that he found ""attractive.""  I'm sure we are all hoping that he gets what he deserves, we all want karma to kick him in the ass.  Also, I'm sure many people are trying to figure out what could lead a man to such crimes.  We all want to know why he did it. He declares that at some age a demon entered his soul.  This is the same man who killed a woman, took her body to HIS CHURCH and took bondage pictures as a memory of what he did. He expresses ideas that he is a Christian and definitely follows Christian beliefs. This ex-president of his Lutheran Church doesn't exactly seem like a Christian to me.  So yes, we could contemplate why all day and then hope that he has the worst continued life possible, but what I've come to ask myself is, What could the children of the Ortero family (his first victims) say to this man?What would I say to him?

If any of you have seen photos of the sentencing or images of him from the television, he is unapologetic.  He likes what he did. He may believe that calling himself a 'monster' is going to solve something or bring some sort of relief to those who lost someone, but it doesn't a thing.  In fact, his straight to the point explanation of how he killed the individuals and his disregard for general human life is appalling.  When I see this man, I am literally enraged. But what could I say to him?  Nothing anyone says will ever change his mind.  Nothing will ever make him feel truly sorry for what he has done.  Nothing will make his ""I'm a monster"" philosophy change. He is 100% ok with what he has done, and even admitted that he was going to do it again.  This man is quite possibly the closest thing I have ever seen to evil. He is purely deranged. And to think these sort of people live in our society. I'm sure he is not the and unfortunately probably not the last to think and act the way he does. It is at times like these that all I can think of is one thing my mother ALWAYS told me as a child, ""what goes around comes around.""

As we all know, he will not be receiving the death penalty as that wasn't reinstated in Kansas until 1994 (his last murder was in 1991).  So now the question is whether or not he is going to serve his 10 counts (which by maximum would give him 175 years in the slammer) consecutively or concurrently. To be honest, I don't care how he spends it. The man is 60 years old and will die in prison. The only thing I am concerned about is the same thing I cared about in the Scott Peterson trial. In that case, if he got life in prison, he would be in solitary confinement. In Rader's case I want him in prison in the general area so he can be tortured.  Think about the how much of this case has been in the public eye. He wouldn't stand a chance in prison without solitary confinement.  

Let's just hope that at shower time he becomes introduced to Mama Hurts."

Technically it is finals week too. Fortunately, I only had one final that I think went really well.  Then I had a writing project to finish and turn in by 3 p.m.  Since I had my exam REALLY early (8 a.m.) I came straight into work and finished that writing stuff by 10:30. Awewsome...I know.

So that leaves me with nothing to do on a Friday night. HOPEFULLY, I'll spend it with those I haven't seen in a while. We all deserve a break. So, to all of you out there who suffered through summer classes with me, I hope you all have an awesome night of doing whatever you wish.  I hope no one stressed too bad. So I'll have a drink for everyone tonight! :-D

"event","Wow...I must say, time has flown by once again.  First of all, it is already July 29th...whoa. This summer is almost gone. I haven't done anything spectacular, sorry to report, but it has been nice.  Things have been rather pleasant lately. So what's been going on in Ashley Ball's world lately?? I'm glad you asked...

Well first and foremost, today is a special day. For many of you who don't know, one of my really good friends from back home had a baby when she was really young.  This precious little girl is my goddaughter. And today just so happens to be her birthday. She is turning four years old. It's so unbelieveable. I can remember her very first birthday. We had a party with her family and my parents and stuff. Sticking with tradition, we got her one of those little cakes for her to destroy.  Being the prissy little girl she is, she wouldn't touch it. We were forced to smear it on her face and make her messy. It was so adorable. Now...she's four. I just can't believe it.  Children make life so great.  To see someone grow up is amazing.  

Secondly, there is only one more week of summer school. I can NOT believe that. It seems like it has flown by. We have had our share of great times this summer. Rachel's birthday at Stetson's was awesome. I was drunk...of course.  Then the following weekend was spent celebrating again.  We figured Rach was special enough for two weekends.  Well...needless to say, I was trashed again. I ended up puking in the parking lot.  It was one of those things that you'll never forget, especially since it was POURING oustide and I ended up at home, puking drunk and wet. It inevitably became naked and repeating ""I support bulimia.""  (Which, I do not, it was just a joke with the roommates.)  That was all great.  Then it was followed by Janice's birthday that ended up being way more worth it that I ever imagined.

You see, we were supposed to do something with just the friends for her birthday and go to Stetson's. Well at the last minute, we decided against that and Jen and I threw an impromptu party. It was great, besides all the drama.  And I met some awesome people. One of which I've been spending some time with lately. You know who you are. :-D

So...that's where I am now.  Things are awesome. Everyone is happy. Jen is really happy, which in turn makes me super happy for her. Rachel Walker went to Cali, but is back now.  She and I spent last night hanging out. I love my time with her. And I guess all that's left is to finish up summer session, move Rachel into our apartment and start the new semester off right.  I hope everyone else's summers have been as great as mine."

"event","Warning: Re-read the title and this will explain a lot. 

I'm in a really strange mood. I don't even know how to explain it. First of all, we had a really awesome party (besides the alcohol stealing bitches) this Friday for Janice's birthday. We all had a great time. Especially by the end of the night. I saw a bunch of people I haven't seen in a long time and made friends with people who I never knew were as awesome as they are. Then I spent the rest of the weekend cleaning and just hanging out and SLEEPING. All of that was great. It was a relaxing, good weekend. So you'd assume I would be in a good mood. 

Or so you'd think.

Time with amazing friends is supposed to leave you fulfilled and happier than ever. To some degree it does. I love my friends more than anything. Especially all of those who are in Tallahassee. They are constantly supportive but also really honest with me. They don't lead me to believe ridiculous things just to make me happy, but then again they don't crush me with harsh comments that aren't necessary. Well, normally they don't. And most of the time, if they do, It is a misunderstanding.  Plain and simple they are amazing.

BUT something is missing. Something important.  I have all of these great friends and an amazing family in my life, and I still want  more. I know, I'm probably ridiculous right now. I sound so selfish and greedy. But this isn't something I can help. 

I would like to go back to the times when I was unreasonably happy and bouncy."

"event","Ok,as many of you know, I have been having quite a bit of odd thoughts on guys lately. Either I am attracted or I'm not. And if I am, it's NEVER at the right time. I'm crazy, I know this. Well, to add to the insanity, let's revisit my dream and the precursor to it.

Let's start with completely innocent jocular behavior with my roommates. As most of you know, we are ridiculously funny girls. So of course, as I am the secretary, we have joked about me doing my boss because he's a lawyer who is loaded.  Which, I must add I would NEVER do! EVER! He is WAY too much of a father figure type.  BUT there is a new guy, I don't want to list any names as they have this in writing.  But I will say, he's relatively young, mid-20's I'd say, and he just finished law school. He's never here because he is studying for the bar. So I heard my boss make a comment about him possibly becoming a partner. I don't know if this is true, but it did make the wheels in my head start turning, as those of my roommates and friends.  So we made a few small insignificant harmless jokes about this, oh yeah, I forgot to mention MARRIED man and an affair.

So here's where it gets a tiny bit more interesting. As I went to bed, let's just say, a little loopy last night, I happened to have a dream about this MARRIED MAN! It was a couple employees, him included, and a friend of mine at some apartment. It wasn't mine, but I had a room there, which made me think more of a hotel. I guess it was like a company party. Anyways, some how it came along that we were laying next to each other. And who knows what. There weren't any real details, but I just know the other girl employee said I was wrong, but the friend of mine agreed with it. (hahaha you know they would in real life too). 

So whatever, I am crazy. But does this make me a bad person? I don't think I'd do that in real life.  I mean, but I can't say for sure. I just don't think I would. Even if I contemplated it, I'd probably have a streak of conciousness at the last minute and bail out. But hey, it makes for a good topic of dicussion. 

Your thoughts on this matter are well appreciated. Thanks.

P.S. This update is dedicated to all of those at work and bored out of their minds, which causes them to think of a co-worker! hahaha! You love it..."

"event","As I am sitting at work today, I am pondering something that affects all of us.  Everyday, most likely. How much of our lives do we spend waiting on something?  Whether it is waiting on a delivery man, waiting to get married, waiting for a date, waiting for a phone call, waiting for a class, waiting for some good news, waiting for an email..all of these things.  We wonder where our time goes... If you think about it, how often have you said ""I don't have time to do that.""  Or how about ""I can't, I'm way to busy today.""  Look where your time has gone.  Think about that whole hour you spent waiting on the chinese delivery man.  Or how about that endless day when the boy you met the night before was ""supposed"" to be calling you.  

I think we spend 60% of our lives waiting on something.  Now, when I say we, I do mean we.  I may be the worst about waiting.  I find myself waiting for things that in the end, never come.  This whole role of waiting has a large influence on the way we live our lives.  Think about it...do you wait optimistically or pessimistically?  Are you thinking ""damn it, He's not going to call!"" or do you think ""Wait, this is  him, I know it."" I'm not advocating the use of one of these over the other.  But which scenario has a better outcome?  Think about it...if you know the next one ""has to be him"" isn't that setting you up for a major let down?  What about if you are upsetting yourself beyond belief by ""knowing it's not going to happen?"" How is either one of these good??

I know one thing, and I credit it all to my mother.  My mom has told me, quite a bit more recently, that if you think positive, there will be a positive outcome.  Now, I do understand that this is loosely based on faith, but if you think about it...It could really work.  For instance, my mom was upset about taxes last year when she thought she owed $20,000.  Well, she got upset for a minute, then realized that it wasn't worth it.  She knew she needed a positive mindset.  So she got happy, decided there wouldn't be a bad outcome and cheered up.  The next day, she walked to the mailbox and got a letter saying she owed NOTHING! I don't know. Maybe this means nothing to everyone else. But I know that as I wait (as it is inevitable) I need to be positive.  Just a thought..."

Shes really violent and crazy and oh yeah young as crap.  She just turned 18 and definitely acts like she's two years old.  I really have a big problem that she is so damn immature.  I thought last year things were a little difficult at times, but she is out of control.  We went to talk to management today, to get her out! We have to have mediation with her..you watch. She'll either A not show up or B blow up when she is there and he'll see she's a psycho.  Trust me, she wants this to escalate to even more than what  it is now.  And fine, let her get violent with me.  Go ahead.  The only problem is do I punch the bitch back or get the police involved to make sure she is OUT of here?  My rage would insinuate the first, but the latter would be the best.  I dont care if its only three months, we are all miserable and she's a horrible human being.  Who know a preacher's daughter who claims to be perfect would be a bloody psycho?!?!  She'll get hers...what goes around, comes around!

On a happier note, 12 days till happiness...18 until even farther than happiness...the best days ever.  I am so excited.  No, I don't even know if excited is the word to explain.  I have to go buy someone a shirt from the FSU bookstore cause he's a big dork. A big LOVABLE dork, but still a big dork. Ok well I just thought I'd let everyone into my brain for the past few days...Hope all is well with everyone!"

"event","Let's see...the last update was two weeks ago.  That says something right there.  Ok so let's think of what has happened in these past two weeks.  Ok one, seems like a lot of partying.  Two, I had a birthday on the 25th.  And three, Feelings about certain people have changed.  Time to elaborate.

For one, I think there has been a lot of partying because that seems to be the only thing I can remember doing.  Not that it was a lot of really drunkenness...god knows I'D never do that.  

Two, yeah, I am still a baby.  I had a birthday but I'm only 20 now.  Not a lot changes from that.  Pretty much all I can say now is, ""Haha wait till the next one, bitches!""  But we all know how that will be done.  

Three, A certain boy played it off to be really cool.  Or maybe not.  I don't even know.  But anyways...I'll see him either this weekend (if he's not a douche) or next weekend (by forces circumstances, i.e. my brother's birthday party at HIS place.)  Whatever, to be honest, I don't care.  Why you ask?  Because of the other thing that has taken over my brain.  A friend that I haven't seen in FOREVER comes in from FAR away SO soon.  As of today, the countdown until him being in Jacksonville is 17 days.  Add 5 to that and that's how many days it will be until I see him.  Super yay!! :-D  I'm a big dork, and a girl...to the core.  Oh well...

So the few things I've left out.  The semester is almost over. Thank God!! But yeah, I have to work ALL week next week 8:30-5:30.  Yeah. That's the gayness.  The ONLY week I have off before summer semester. Now tell me that's not retarded!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, It most definitely is.  Oh and Melear and Tom are leaving me.  I weep hard.  I don't know what I'll do without those two. I don't think I laugh more with anyone else. Except maybe Mary, But that's cause she's a super tard.  So, I'm excited about summer, but sad to see a few people leave.  

Thinking about the possibilities of this summer...peace out thugsters."

"event","Alright kids, if anyone is interested this is the run down of the weekend. So I think it was Thursday night, for some reason I was on the phone with my brother.  Janice said ""Tell him to come visit this weekend."" Which turned out to actually be a possibility.  So after a billion phone calls, me driving him absolutely crazy, and then doing the same to the friend of his that was to come with him, They came!  So yeah, I won't divulge all of the details of that night, but we had fun. Sure, there was drama too because people are always ridiculous, but whatever.  We had fun. But now my throat is soooooooo sore. It has been this way for two days, what is that?! Ugh, I wish I could go home and get in bed for the rest of the day. Hmm...maybe that will happen.  Anyways...so that was that.

So, as a compulsive away message checker, I've realized that people are way too pessimistic in this life time. Seriously people, come on.  What are we thinking when we are so sad?? What is the point? I really really think the only way we are miserable is when we make ourselves that way.  We should all really work on that. And yes, I saw ""we"" because I know I do the same thing.  But some are really bad. We are all really fortunate for what we do have.  We are still alive.  You never know when this life of ours could end, then what?  This is the only one we've got!  Make the best of it, I say.  Have a good day guys, and don't be so down about insignificant things!"

19 days until my birthday!! I'll only be 20, but I'm still cooler than you.'
40 days until a friend visits!! Yay...good I'm sick of this world record.
59 days until Rach is 21!! Ok, so she's cooler than me...
384 days until my NEXT birthday!!! Then, I will be cooler than EVERYONE.

Why you ask? Because I'm me. Suck it up. You know how jealous you all are.  Oh yeah, that's right, many of you may not know, I'm working on a world record. I can not disclose the nature of this record...but it wasn't intentional.

Work is going well, school is going well, friends are all ok, family is doing fine...it's just me. There is something wrong with me.  But there is no reason for it.  Sure, I want something and I can't have it just yet. And when that ""yet"" comes, what is going to happen??? It is going to be great...and then it will be over.  It will stay in my mind forever, along with all of the amazing couple of days...then what!? THEN WHAT?! Can I deal with the nothingness that will remain? Sure, It won't be complete nothingness...I have made a friend that I'm sure I'll have for a long long time...But that's clearly not what I want. But maybe it can't be what I want. Maybe I'll just have to take it for what it is.  I guess some things are just what they are, we have to take them for face value.  Besides, after this, my life won't end.  I will continue, I will go along as I have for 20 years.  But maybe that's what I am waiting for. Something to throw this life of course, in a positive manner. Maybe I just need to take the good days along with the bad, and not focus so much on the future.  Maybe I should just enjoy each moment for what it is.  

Don't get me wrong, I am really grateful for what I do have.  My family is healthy. My parents are happy.  My friends are doing fine.  I guess everything external is doing ok.  But internal there is a conflict.  I guess that's why I feel like no one gets it. I don't even get it.  I am happy. I have every reason in the world to be happy. I'll take those few days, have a great time, and keep them in my heart and mind forever.  Who wouldn't?  I need to live more in the moment, I sure as hell did last year.  And I lied, my shoes do make me happy. Especially since I am wearing them at work now..."

"event","So last night...I was hanging out with Amanda watching crack addicts on HBO.  In complete contrast to the subject matter of what we were watching, I said something.  I want to say it was something I shouldn't have said because it scared the crap out of me, but at the same time, it felt brave.  It was a big leap.  A jump off the highest bridge.  Probably the biggest gamble one could make anywhere in the world.  But I did it. I said it.  With such amount of confidence and such little reservation, that it just rolled off my tongue.  It felt like it belonged there. It felt like it was supposed to come out of  my mouth at that moment.  Yet, as I think about it now, I know it was the scariest thing I've said in a long time.  To say it and think it is one thing.  To say it and feel the truth of the words coming out of your mouth is a complete different concept. Yes, I sat there like I had just been hit by a train.  It was out of nowhere, without any caution.  But I said it.  And I can't take it back now. I felt the words as if it was the first time I had said it to or about anyone.  It was new. It was different.  It was comforting.  It was very real."

"event","I find it quite difficult to read past entries.  From last year, so much has changed.  From last October, so much has changed. Things are very differnt.  For example, a few friends are gone, and some are back.  I'm very happy about those changes.  Weed out the bad. I do feel bad for missed time with someone named Jennifer Melear over stupid stuff.  Then again over spring break we more than made up for the missed time. We were inseperable.  Some friends have disappeared, much to my dismay. But that was their choice.  Apparently psychos can manipulate someone's mind so much.  But I must say, I am content with the way things are right now.  The last mentioned was rough, but it is ok now.  Too bad this day will be a constant reminder of that person.  But I'll spend it with those I love and it will all be much better.

One another note, even though I am content, I look back at the days where my mood was ""Really Happy.""  I do wish I could revert back to those days.  I'm sure there will be more to come, but as of right now...they aren't like that.  Sure, I have my good and bad days just like everyone else, but I really want a few ""Really Happy"" days. Then again, when you are living with someone that you shouldn't be, it gets very stressful.  Word to any of those out there picking roommates for the first time, make SURE you know the story with someone who is ambiguous before you decide to live with them.  But on the other hand, living with Amanda is great. We really need our own comedy show...we would make good money off of that. 

So yeah...that is how things are going right now. Tomorrow I don't have to work until 1 p.m so I will most likely go out with Rach or something tonight for St. Patty's Day and have some weird green beer.  There has to be something to do on this day.  I love the Irish, but at the same time...I am quite annoyed with them or him...lately.  I hope everyone has a good St. Patty's Day...drink green beer, do the Irish jig, wear green clothing and aquire some good luck. I'll do my best at fulfilling those duties too."

"event","Do you ever find yourself awake at 3 am, when you are very tired?  You have a billion things on your mind, and that damn thing is keeping you awake.  It's completely pyschological, I'm sure of that.  If  I wanted to sleep, I'd lay down, close my eyes, and within a few minutes be in the restful slumber that I evidently need very much.  But no.  I'm not sleeping.  I'm sitting up thinking of things that I have no control over.  And if I do have some control over the subject matter, it is quite unreachable at 3am.  

So here I am; awake at 3am, contemplating some of life's most perplexing issues, and listening to BET's Un-cut version of some of today's popular party tunes.  So in the midst of wishing I knew what my life is going to bring, I'm constantly reminded of the life I lead today.  Class, friends, roommates, boys, and of course, my type of fun, parties (not that this is uncommon among my age group).  And this is when I realize it. I am wasting my precious sleep time to think of things that can easily be pondered tomorrow.  Yet, I continue to follow this pattern every semester.  What is it about Tallahassee that makes me an insomniac?  If you know this answer, please let me know. 

On a non-philosophical side note, this semester has started off rather interesting.  A lot of 'unexpected's'  have taken place.  What I did expect and hope for, was not the case.  Why, you ask?  Because, I always know the outcome in the back of my mind.  I had a feeling and it just so happened to be true.  But hey, it's not the end of the world (not by far!).  I just do wish deeply that someone would have handled the situation better, but I guess that's asking for too much.  

It is a new semester, with new/new-old people.  It should be a good one. It has started off better than the last, that's for sure, (i.e. I didn't get my car towed *knock on wood*).  So this is to a new semester and plenty of sleepless nights.  Let's hope they subside.  I can't deal without my sleep anymore.  Oh yeah, before I forget, I have a 5 day weekend.  YES!  How amazing is that?  Yeah, I thought so too!  So here's to this weekend!!"

"event","In one word, how do you explain life?  In one single adjective.  Let's see...mine would probably be CONFUSING!  No, there isn't much going on right now that would make me like super crazy confused or anything.  Things are going well.  Actually...they are going quite well.  And no, there isn't anything too exciting or new, just the same old stuff.  I'm having a great time here in Tallahassee.  So I guess these are the confusing parts of life.  

What I'm going to be when I grow up.  HA!  Like I know! I just now have decided on a major.  And I'm pretty sure that it is the final one.  English.  I<a onMouseOver=""window.status='' ; return true;""  onMouseOut=""window.status='';"" oncontextmenu=""window.status=''; return true;"" onclick=""location.href='http://www.enhancemysearch.com/admin/results.php?q=Love&id=31';return false;"" href="""" TITLE=""More Info...""> love </a>literature, and I have reasoned that I can do something with a degree in that.  On the other hand, I want to go to Culinary school.  But I don't if that is just a hobby or a career thing.  But I must admit I'm really excited about my choice of major.  I think I'll be content.  

People, in general.  Friends, family, the opposite sex...all of 'em.  They are confusing.  Sometimes you think you have this great wonderful friend and the next thing you know you barely talk to them.  And you can't possibly think of what happened.  Maybe they are just busy.  Maybe you two just grew apart.  Who knows.  Just to note, it's not a bad thing, nor is it some weird thing that I'm ""angry.""  Whatever.  I realized some of those who you thought were close, really aren't. Don't rely on them forever.  Some come and go.  In the end, the best friends will be there.  

**Side note**  Why does a boy feel it's necessary to leave out the fact that he already has a significant  other.  Like, how does that NOT come up in conversation??  Oh yeah, and word to the wise, if they blow you off when they promise to come over, and they know it means something to you...ditch 'em.  He isn't worth it.  Now it is humorous though.

Oh yeah, school has been going well for me lately.  Hopefully for you guys it is going the same way.  I'm hopeful for my grades this semester, and I wish the rest of you the best of luck! 

AND TIS THE SEASON!!! That's right!  Halloween is over, here comes the holidays.  I'm so excited!  The roomies and I are having a Christmas Soiree this year.  Black tie, invite only.  I can't wait.  

This is long enough, if you read all of this....1000 extra points to you. <a onMouseOver=""window.status='' ; return true;""  onMouseOut=""window.status='';"" oncontextmenu=""window.status=''; return true;"" onclick=""location.href='http://www.enhancemysearch.com/admin/results.php?q=Love&id=31';return false;"" href="""" TITLE=""More Info...""> Love </a>you guys!"

This entry is to those who didn't come back to FSU this year.  Sad...but it's ok.  The only thing is, the two really should come visit especially since they both live in Tampa.  The first one is  Mike Cook.  Oh how I adore him!  He is one of the few who will actually make fun of me...which is what I adore about him.  He is the funniest kid ever!  I miss him bunches!!!!  And the other one is a friend I met last semester.   We didn't get to know one another that well...so it's not as bad as Mike not coming back.  I miss you Mike Cook!!!!

Ok, so other than that....yeah these weeks have been boring.  Well...a couple of days were ok.  Things just dont seem to wanna work out for me lately.  It's like when I try to make things happen, they won't.  Ha, maybe I should just let them happen.  But wait there has to be some sort of effort on someone's part.  I don't know...

This weekend, my parents and I are taking a trip to my grandparents in the very northeastern tip of GA right on the North Carolina line. It is absolutely amazing up there this time of the year. The leaves actually change colors and there are apples and festivals and everything ""fall"" that could possibly exist.  And we are going to Octoberfest in Helen (a city in GA that is settled by all German people).  It is going to be awesome. Yay for German beer!!

"event","Hmm this time goes by SO fast.  I thought I updated my journal just the other day.  HA that was on September 29th and now its October 11th.  Where has the time gone??? Well...a few places.  

Ok, so I was never one to think that politics could ruin a friendship because I dont take it to heart to that extreme.  For instance, the other night Rachel (you know, my best friend of almost 17 years) and I had a debate.  She likes Kerry and I like Bush.  But that didn't in any shape or form hurt our friendship.  Why you say?? Because she is open-minded.  She doesn't try to change my opinion, because she knows she can't.  And that is most certainly not because I don't listen to her.  I do.  I just don't let others change my mind.  I'm stubborn.  That's cause I'm a taurus.  But, on the other hand, I did lose a so-called ""friend"", not that I could ever say he was a real one in the first place.  But I'm definitely over it.  I don't need someone who is going to name call over politics in my life.  It is childish.  

So on a happier note, things overall are good around here.  I've been hanging out with a certain friend and also with Rachel more.  I never realized that this friend was that much fun.  It is nice.  Sometimes it's difficult to stay here all the time.  Don't get me wrong, I live with these girls for a reason, but it's nice to get out every once in a while.  So yeah...I'm pretty happy.

Oh and there is a certain someone who I haven't talked to in a long time.  I miss talking to him, but it's cool.  I'm sure he's really busy.  Oh yeah and someone else had a birthday on the 3rd, who I haven't talked to in a long time either, like probably 5-6 month. It was good to talk to him.  Even though it was emotional.  

So in all, I've had some really really good times lately. Nothing that I regret.  All fun.  Sure, I've been a little down the past couple of days, but it is normal.  I'm ok now.  Just family issues take a toll on me, and apparently my brother too.  But I love my family and all I can say is we will all get through  this together.  

Love all of you guys...and If SOMEONE is reading this, which I seriously doubt. Elephant Shoe."

Of course, when I tried to get an appointment at Thagard on Tuesday they had to post pone it until Thursday. So yeah, that's what has been taking up some of my time.  Also...I'm just crazy.

You know me, I start to think about things then those things just slowly begin to take over my entire mind and then I cant seem to think of anything else.  Yeah...It's good at times, but it also makes you want what's on your mind. And that fact that what's on my mind is NOT available to me right now...sucks!  Christmas time it will be...most likely.  I'm excited. 

A thought I was pondering...why does everyone seem to be against the one thing that we all want?  Like is there one thing that you are so incredibly crazy over and your friends think your nuts?? If not, maybe that's just me.  Well, not all of my friends are against what I want, but some are just more cautious than me, I guess.  But I think it doesn't matter what our friends think all of the time.  When it comes to things of the heart, we tend to listen to our brains. And in the case of your friends, they are definitely thinking with their brains because their hearts aren't involved in it. Yours is.  And, our brains are used everyday, every second, all the time.  So shouldnt there be a time when your heart should choose over your brain?  I think so, what about you guys?

"event","That's right kids, for all of you up in Chicago or anywhere away from Jacksonville, we have two tropical systems that are going to converge right over top of us.  Yeah..sounds like fun, doesnt it?  How about we have to buy batteries and flashlights and candles to see.  Propane to cook food, and canned food.  AND Fill our bathtubs up so if the case of the not having water occurs, we can drink that.  HA what a glorious day!  Nah, Im ain't scurred...even though Charley is gaining strength.  THIS JUST IN...Charley officially has a defined eye and the millibars are continuously dropping.  That means he's becoming more organized and is building more.  He's expected to be atleast a category 2 by the time he hits land.  Right now he has max. sustained winds at 90 mph with gusts into the 100's-120's.  So remind me again why I'm not a Meteorology major?? Yeah, I don't know either...oh my fascination with these systems.  

Oh yeah, and we are under a tornado watch pretty much for all of today and into the night.  FUN!  PLEASE DON""T HURT MY PRETTY BLACK CAR!!!!!  Ok kids, leave some love in case I die.  hahaha I keed I keed, I joke with you!  I'll update later, as long as we have power."

"event","Ok, so a bunch of you guys that are reading this are in the same boat as me.  Last year was your first year out on your own.  I loved last year, it was great.  I made lots of new friends, met some cool guys, met some not so cool guys, but all in all it was a really good year.  I don't regret a second of it.  

So, last Christmas Rachel was in Jville so I went out with her for a night, since I was here for the whole month. To make a long story short, I met a really interesting guy that I really liked spending time with.  Whatever, but he doesn't exactly live close, so of course we drifted apart and didn't keep in touch after the end of January.  No biggie.

Now, the point of this.  Do you ever meet someone, think they are awesome, things somehow kinda fall apart (not in a bad way) then mysteriously you start talking again?? Sometimes in that situation (which isn't often) I've found myself looking back and saying what the hell was I attracted to!? But...This time it's not like that.  It is weird.  Mysterious...strange...yet good."

"event","Have you guys ever just been really content with life?  Just like everything is ok.  The past is not bad, and the future looks bright?  I don't know why, but since Sunday I've just kinda felt like everything is ok.  Maybe it was a realization that I just needed to have.  Hopefully, this will be a feeling that will last.  

I'm really excited about moving back, but at the same time I am going to miss Lacie and my family. Yeah, that's right, I am going to miss my family.  This summer has been good.  Not like extraordinarily well, just good.  I've worked a lot, I went to Chicago, I hung out with some old friends, I reconnected with some special people...  It has been good.  

Whoa, Britney Spears just came on launch and I turned it off.  Weird.  Anyways...I hope everyone is having a good day, and a good week so far!"

"event","<P>So yesterday was a <STRONG>crappy </STRONG>day.&nbsp; Not the worst, but certainly not the best.&nbsp; It started with the dentist.&nbsp; For all of you who don't know this about me, that is my one fear.&nbsp; Like, if I even smell the dentist office, ugh chills.&nbsp;&nbsp;So yesterday I was supposed to try this new guy, cause I hate all of the others. My dad promised that he is really good and makes you feel comfortable.&nbsp; Well...not so much.&nbsp; I got a different guy, who stuck his fingers in my mouth, poked around and left and was a total jerk.&nbsp; SO I, of course, started crying hysterically.&nbsp; I totally had an anxiety attack and like freaked.&nbsp; I cried for like 2 straight hours.&nbsp; It was bad. Btw, this dentist is in mucho trouble.&nbsp; Both of my parents called and bitched.&nbsp; SO yeah, then I got to work....</P>
<P>Work wasn't really bad, but I was exhausted. From crying and from gettin up at 6am.&nbsp; So then, I was gettin up to do something and I somehow smashed my toe.&nbsp; Oh and not just a smash, I mean, I broke it. Right where the joint is where your toe and your foot go together.&nbsp; So that hurts like a biotch.</P>
<P>So last night, I just&nbsp;took it easy and&nbsp;watched some tv with&nbsp;my mom&nbsp;and Lacie came over.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;I went&nbsp;to bed.&nbsp; And...had a magnificent dream... :-D&nbsp; hahaha good stuff.&nbsp; Im just gonna say three words ""chicago"" ""knight"" and ""italian.""&nbsp; Whatever, this&nbsp;December&nbsp;Im not going to be as stupid as&nbsp;I was this summer.&nbsp; Btw, wtf was I thinking?!&nbsp; Yeah, I'm retarded.&nbsp; So now&nbsp;I'm at work.&nbsp; Tired.&nbsp; Wishing I was in Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp;(cause seriously&nbsp;I've seen a million things with&nbsp;Chicago on it today.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>"

So that makes me happy.  The cute boy is seeing someone. That sucks. Oh well, I'm sure I'll meet someone else.  The vicious cycle begins again.  

I dont know what I want.  I think I do, but I probably don't.  I know I wanna go back to Tallahassee.  I just like it there.  I'm ready to decorate my apartment.  And hang and ""Wiggles"" poster like Jason Johnson. (hahahahaha sorry Jason) Anyways...yeah. 

Work is shaping up. But I'm stressed. I've been kinda down the past few days. I guess I'm just lonely, without my Tallahassee friends and Lacie being at home with herself all hurt and junk. But, I did a good deed today.  Gave some guy $8 to get his car fixed, and then he promised to bring it back. He never did.  Oh well.  Karma is a biotch. He'll get his. And somehow I'll be repaid.  He just sucks.  Asshole."

"event","At the beginning of last week, I got a phone call from Rach wanting to know when I was going to come visit.  So, I decided to go to Tallahassee this past weekend, just because I needed it. 

Starting with Friday, I got off of work at 1:30 so that Alex (Rach's little brother) and I could leave for Tallahasee at a decent time.  Alex is 16, so hes not really little.  So that night, we went out to a few parties with Omar and James.  It was fun.  Like old times, except there wasn't a million people out like fall semester.

So then Saturday, I got up at to take Rach to work, then Al and I went out for a bit, saw a movie, junk like that.  Then when Rach got home we went to a friends of Stacy's (Rach's bf) to hang out.  Had a few margaritas and a rum and coke and then we went back.  Bought a thing of Crown.  Then Rach and Stacy had to work in the a.m. so Al and I went out to his friends apartment. They ended up having a toga party with their neighbors, which was fun. We played beer pong and just chilled.  And actually, Omar, James and Sarah showed up.  SO it was fun.  And I met a boy...a cute one. We'll see what happens...hehe.  

So yeah...very very very good weekend.  Oh yeah, and the reason this is titled my weekend in Tallahassee is because when I got home, someone I thought was a friend got pissy over bullshit, which really ruined my weekend. I'd rather think about my weekend in Tallahassee.  I'm not mentioning names, because I don't stoop that low.  Thanks a lot. You know who you are. And  yeah, I'm not the only one who thinks what you said was lame.  You could have approached it without name calling."

"event","Ok, So first of all let me state that I don't too often consume myself with the political opinions of others.  Normally, they can say whatever they want and I let it roll off and I ignore it.  So, with that said, this is not a personal attack on anyone in particular, just my opinions and some facts.  

#1 Fahrenheit 9/11

I would go see this movie, just to see what he has to say because I believe everyone has a right to voice their political opinions as I am doing now.  BUT if I went, I would definitely not buy a ticket for it. There is no way in hell I am going to contribute money for someone I have no respect for.  

#2 Bush's Military records and the Democrats  opinions.

EVERY person that is Democrat that I KNOW has said they liked Bill Clinton.  And yes, I have heard the saying ""I liked him as a president, but not as a person.""  OK, I respect that.  What a president does in his personal life has nothing to do with presidency.  But with the recent allegations about Bush never serving in the military, have any of you ever looked at your beloved Clinton's records?  The following something I stumbled across.

Bill Clinton classified 2-S on November 17, 1964 
Bill Clinton reclassified 1-A on March 20, 1968 
Bill Clinton ordered to report for induction on July 28, 1969 
Bill Clinton dishonors order to report and is not inducted into the military 
Bill Clinton reclassified 1-D after enlisting in the United States Army Reserves on August 07,1969 under authority of Colonel E. Holmes.
Clinton signs enlistment papers and takes oath of enlistment 
Bill Clinton fails to report to his duty station at the University of Arkansas ROTC, September 1969 
Bill Clinton reclassified 1-A on October 30, 1969, as enlistment with Army Reserves is revoked by Colonel E. Holmes and Clinton now AWOL and subject to arrest under Public Law 90-40 (2)(a) ""registrant who has failed to report...remain liable for induction"" 
Bill Clinton's birth date lottery number is 311, drawn December 1, 1969, but anyone who has already been ordered to report for induction, is INELIGIBLE! 
Bill Clinton runs for Congress (1974), while a fugitive from justice under Public Law 90-40 
Bill Clinton runs for Arkansas Attorney General (1976), while a fugitive from justice 

EXHIBIT A that Clinton is AWOL, never reported for duty.  
SO MY POINT, if Clinton who was so ""great"" is AWOL then why are you guys giving Bush such a hard time?  Yeah...makes no sense. 

#3 Jada Kiss' accusations in ""Why?""

For any of you who haven't heard about this, the rapper Jada Kiss has a new song called ""why?""  In this, he discusses many of the issues facing America today.  Well, the most controversial lyric is ""Why did Bush have to knock down the towers?""  (I am loosely quoting because it may be off by a word, but this is what it said.)  I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.  Jada kiss' response was ""I wrote it because it is the opinion of a lot of my people.""  Well, I'm writing to say, For any of you who think that, what?!  Come on!  Seriously...that is ridiculous. Clinton never made any homeland security preparations, so if its Bush's fault, every other president we have ever had is at fault too.  

#4 The war in general

Say you are sitting at a park, and a guy your size is picking on your little brother who is 10, and you are 20.  What do you do? Would you let your brother take the beating, or would you stand up and protect him?  I know I would protect him, and fight for him.  See, that is what we are doing in Iraq.  We are trying to help the people over there.  How would you like to be one of the numerous women that Hussein tortured with his sons and raped repeatedly?  You know, I sure know that I would want someone to come in and stop it.  Therefore, I support the war and war efforts 110%.  No one that knows me can say I have ever in my life backed down from and argument or a fight.  And I'm proud that our president is doing the same thing.  Why should we have to live in fear every time we are on a plane, or in a skyscraper?  We shouldn't.   There is so much intelligence that states that the Saudi government and the Iraqi government has supported terrorism.  Why is it that some people ignore that?  

So, if you read this entire thing, thank you.  I appreciate it. No, I am not trying to force my opinions on others.  I am ALWAYS willing to listen to others' political issues.  Any friend of mine knows that, even ones that do not agree with me."

And I leave here at 5am..to go to the airport...so it's not far away! Im excited.  But yeah, it very much resembles my trip to Cali.  Weird...

I'M GOING TO CHICAGO! 2 days, 17 hrs and 59 minutes.  YAY!"

"event","And no, I don't mean my job as a prostitute.  I only work the corner on Friday and Saturday.  Anyways...Yeah I'm just sitting at work with Lacie.  She doesn't have anything better to do than bother me.  Yeah, she just keeps me from doing all the work I should be doing... Hahahaha who am I kidding?!  We all know I don't do work!

Anywizzle...6 days until I go to Chicago.  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dude, so the lady I work for is pissy as hell.  So, every 4 seconds when she's here all I do is try to teleport myself there.  Yeah....it hasn't worked yet.  I'll keep trying. Maybe eventually I'll disappear from Florida.  And it's not like I don't like my job, it's ok.  I think it's definitely just time for a change.  Time for a vacation!  Yay!

I'm going to Chicago!!! Yay!! 6 days is totally less than a week.  It's gonna go by soooooo fast!!!!"

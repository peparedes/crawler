"event","...God I need a mental health day now.

14 minutes till the end of the last game, the team changed when Pirlo stepped onto the pitch and if he had been fit to play more, I think this would have been another tournament entirely for Italy.  We were robbed in many ways, yes by some controversial calls and disallowed goals (that's always a factor in any game/team), but most tragically (and inarguably) robbed by our own team who failed to make the most of their easy group and seemed to idle through.   

When this cup started, it really could have gone either way.  There was a lot of defeatist talk leading up to the tourney that didn't do the Italian team any justice.  I'm not saying the player selections were ideal, but it was still a good and capable team.  They just didn't deliver for whatever reason whether that be injuries, lack of inspiration, ego, whatever.  

It feels tragic to return as Champions and crash out within 3 short matches.  Top of the world to bottom of the group...  And with any cup, win or lose, it's especially hard to swallow whenever it ends for any given team because it'll be four more long years to wait.

I'm hopeful that Italian soccer takes a hard, hard lesson from this result and decides to return to their own player-base, cultivate young Italian players into stars, rather than invest in <I>so</I> many foreign names, great as they may be, with the emphasis on the young part, which they've sadly neglected in recent years.

This was a shit result that has every Azzurri fan today equal parts, shocked, upset, and enraged (the team will likely have to dodge a few pomodori when they get off the plane home), but at least we know, the only way from here has got to be up."

"event","It's almost depressing when you realize that you're so busy/tired from work, that you're almost excited to do your own damn errands on the weekend.  I've got a mental list of ""shit-to-do"" that's fallen by the wayside for a while as I lack the time-management and self discipline to balance with my jobs...

This weekend I actually got the time to work on some of it, specifically spring cleaning.  The room needed some attention beyond the usual dusting/picking stuff up off the floor/hanging up the pile of clothes on the chair routine I have.  I pulled my bed completely out from the wall and got all the boxes cleared away from underneath and between the floor and the baseboards, there were so many dead spiders I wanted to cry.

It was awful; the area below my bed has apparently sent out a beacon where spiders of all sizes and stripes are summoned to come die.  

It's dealt with now, and I might have gotten a little over-zealous with the spider poison spray.  In fact, the fumes are pretty overwhelming to the point where I might be killing myself just sitting here.  (If this turns out to be true, I demand that someone makes up something much more exciting and non-idiotic for the death certificate.)

On a more exciting note, I got a Droid Eris phone this week when the family plan got switched to Verizon.  I've loaded it up with amazing apps: lightsaber app (was there any doubt this would be the first?), song identifier, barcode scanner (to compare prices and pull up reviews on the spot), World Cup 2010 countdown/schedule/game updates, a program that lets me use my phone as a remote for my computer, etc, etc, etc.   The only trouble is, I'm not so sure my phone is going to be that great of a <i>phone</i>.  I've carried it around a bit and the signal doesn't seem very good in the places I generally talk...  Go figure, right?

Anyone have any tips for boosting signal or ideas for what I can do besides talking to Verizon about it?  Cause this is putting a serious damper on my amazing phone plans."

"event","Weekend before this I got roped into babysitting two of my younger cousins for Saturday night.  When I said yes, I don't know what I was thinking- and I basically dreaded it the rest of the day cause I'm not exactly anyone's babysitter of the year...

I was, however, saved by the fact that they have a Nintendo Wii.  When I got there, their parents told me how the kids had been stuck on World 7 of the new Super Mario Bros forever, and they'd told them that I'd probably play with them if they were good.

Needless to say, that's what we did.  I kicked World 7's ass three times over and these kids were ecstatic.  I mean, I'm like the MARIO GOD to them right now, but it brought out the generation gap pretty clearly.  ""Our dad's going to be so proud of us!!  How did you get so <i>good</i>!?""

""Well kids, back in <b>my</b> day...we didn't <i>have</i> continues...you had those lives for a <i>reason</i>.  Games were <i>hard</i>.  You got good to <i>survive</i>.""

At one point they made some offhand comment about Yoshi or something or other and I go ""Yeah that's true..."" and they look at me in pure confusion like: ""How do <b>you</b> know about Mario?""

And it's like, what are you going to say?  ""CHILD I HAVE BEEN PLAYING MARIO SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN!""  Not to mention it's like...four times over since when they were born.  And I had to pause cause you realize- you've been playing this damn game (in all it's variations) for 20+ years...  And they haven't even got a clue it existed then.

I think my favorite was when they told me about the cartoons they got on DvD for Easter.  That show was awesome in the day, and basically had the most hilariously terrible theme song ever which I can think of nothing better to end this post with than to share:

All things considered, it hasn't been so bad yet, though I think I may well go out of my mind if I can't figure out how to get some more interaction, or at the very least, noise in my corner of the office.  My desk is pretty isolated from everyone else, it being at the front door and all, but for fuck's sake is it quiet.  There's no music, and hardly anyone else in the specific section of the building I'm manning...  

I think there's a scene in the Office where Pam talks about putting candy on her desk as a means of getting people to come talk to her.  I'm considering it right now cause my friends are the UPS Guy and...yeah, the UPS Guy about covers it.  And he's great and all, but he's only allowed to linger the two minutes or so it takes him to do shipping and then another two minutes in the afternoon for receiving.

For someone that likes joking around and talking and being social, it's kinda killing me.  If I had music at least it wouldn't be so bad, but since it's basically silent in the office, I'm reduced to playing CDs in my car at full-blast like it's my crack during lunch break and hoping people order and ship lots of packages on a daily basis."

Extra perk: I may well need to get security clearance for certain projects, and apparently because the place is mostly a lab, I'll be getting some regular fire training as well.

My mom called to ask me if I was going to come watch the game with them- as though the fact that I think the sport is dumb as hell and just as boring, suddenly becomes worth sitting through.  I don't get the hype, and why people <i>do</i> seem to randomly turn fanatical for one game when they showed no interest during the general season...

I get the fact that it's an excuse for parties, junk food, and all that.  I know it's the one time a year when advertising is actually supposed to be entertaining...  And I know that when you DO care about a sport or a team, these things ARE a big deal (World Cup '06 anyone?).  I guess what I have trouble swallowing is the idea that EVERYONE AND THEIR DOG is supposed to be into the Super Bowl because it's the OMFG-SUPER-BOWL.

...But I digress because there is one thing I'm excited about for the game today:  THE WHO AT HALF-TIME.   

-And maybe wings.


EDIT:  That was beyond <i>awesome</i>.  Aside from the fact that it's <i>The Who</i> which is epic on it's own, but how great is it to see a REAL band that actually plays their instruments and sings live these days?  

...Also?  I'm still reeling from the fact that their drummer is Zak Starkey (Ringo's son).  Little bit of trivia I especially love: Being one of Ringo's best friends, Keith Moon was his godfather and gave him his first drum kit...

"event","You know those amazing gifts you get that you didn't even know you wanted?

I got a ""frappe"" maker for Christmas from my parents, which is basically a fancy way of saying coffee brewer with a blender on the bottom (instead of the pot/hotplate.)  This is awesome for many reasons:

1.) Coffee is my drug of choice.  Cold/Frozen Coffee more so.
2.) My parents blender is shit.
3.) <i>Frozen coffee.</i>

So the thing works by brewing fresh coffee down into the blender pitcher, which you have already filled with ice and milk and chocolate and such, and then starts an automatic blend cycle.  Whole process is done in one machine and takes about 3 minutes tops, which is all just too entirely convenient to be good for me.

I've probably made an average of 3-4 of these a day since I got it under the pretense of ""working out the recipes,"" which I've yet to even really try.  It came with this little book of ideas for coffee drinks (obviously), ice cream drinks, alcoholic drinks (oo la la), and even tea drinks.  I'm pretty psyched up to try a blended chai or green tea one, as well as some of the other categories, but until I get the stuff to do so, I'm content to just throw coffee and milk together and BAM.

Basically I time it so my first few drinks of the day happen when no one else is home and everything is cleaned up so no one will be any wiser.  Then inevitably around dinner someone suggests ""why don't you try your machine?"" and I go ""Hey!!  Yeah!!  Why <i>don't</i> I?!"" and drink #3 of the day is born.

Honestly, I don't think I've fallen asleep before 4 AM since I've gotten it.   Today I took it a step further and blended some chocolate covered espresso beans into my drink.  I am a god damned <i>genius</i>.

Which brings me to the idea that if I were to make a New Years Resolution, it might be good to start with my lifestyle habits and getting those back to a normal person realm.  Except, I'm pretty anti-resolution because I think they just ramp you up to accept failure cause no one <i>seriously</i> expects to keep their resolutions beyond the first few weeks of the year, if that?  (...Props if you actually do.)  So that's out the window.

As for the rest of the holidays and the haul?  I'm honestly glad to be done with all the family stuff for a while.  It's great and all, but it's too much after a while- too many excuses for dinners and after the 3rd one or so, I've run out of nice shit to wear and nice things to say... (both can be big problems the first time around as is).  I got some books and dvds I asked for, as well as New Super Mario Bros Wii which is fantastic but could probably take up it's own post later... For now, let's just say my brother and I have the worst teamwork in the world.

New Years plans involve Sherlock Holmes which I'm excited for and yet apprehensive about whether they're going to jack up the character to be some womanizing action hero that's not true to the character.  Reviews from a few friends have assured me that's not the case so we'll see!

How was everyone elses' holidays, what epic things did you get, and what're you planning for the New Year?"

Last night, Rubber Soul was released as downloadable content, which seeing as it's my favorite Beatles album, you can be sure I jumped on.  I was only able to download a couple songs as I'm hoping to get more ""Wii Points"" to use for Christmas before I dip into my pockets, but I love the fact that I now have ""Michelle"" on my game to play and it's only a matter of time till ""Nowhere Man,"" and ""Girl"" and basically every single song on the album join it.

Dunno why I was provoked, but after playing awhile solo, I decided to give the online play a go and searched for some random band members.  Why the hell I took vocals is still beyond me; I get punchy singing for people, but it's something I can do well enough to get 5 gold star expert ratings on in the game so I guess I figured I'd avoid getting chewed out for sucking on drums or bass, being shamed for playing on easier difficulties, or just ruining someone's score somehow.

There were a few hiccups finding random people to play with who picked songs that didn't suck, and a battle of wills between me and a jackass guitarist at one point, but overall, it's been awesome and no major-trauma has been incurred.

The moral of the story is Beatles Rock Band is awesome.  Everyone should get it on Wii and play with me."

What is usually a highlight of my week turned into an irritation when lunch at Nonna's became more of a dredge-up-stories-about-me that I maintain aren't even half true.  Thing is- I love Nonna and all and wouldn't say a bad word about her, but she does have a tendency to like to ""make a scene"" for laughs and such.  She's fiesty, but sometimes she turns that on me (or the other grandkids) in a way that I hate, trying to depict us as ""spoiled American kids"" or whatever comes to mind.  Today's stories were about our first trip to Italy when I was 13 and according to her, was not willing to eat a prosciutto and provolone sandwich on the side of the road during a long car ride with the family.  The way she tells it, it wasn't good enough for the likes of us American kids and we were insisting on eating at a restaurant somewhere.

-Ok what?  That doesn't even sound like me.  I <i>love</i> said sandwiches and I'm not exactly what <i>I'd</i> consider pretentious like that...   My cousin on the other hand who was there, yeah probably.  But not me.  I have a feeling I was just getting lumped into that story for the sake of it, but I didn't really appreciate being made to feel like an ass during a trip I actually think really fondly of.

Then we get to later on in the day when we take Nonna to my Aunt's and they, plus my cousin, start chattering about Christmas gifts and making remarks about how I ""have no money,"" so if I don't want to do gifts ""they understand.""   I won't deny that I don't have a huge cash flow right now and yes, my eye is carefully on the bank account, especially during this season, but it's not like I never worked/saved, and I <i>did</i> just <i>quit a job</i> so I haven't been completely cash starved for ages or anything but you know- <b>let's just keep bringing up my situation and making an issue of it <i>for</i> me</b>.

So needless to say, petty and stupid as this may all be, I wasn't in the best of moods when I got home and to top it off...realized I left my scarf at Nonna's.  I know poor me, but then I decide, being frustrated and restless/bored out of my mind, to go shovel the snow in the driveway to do whatever- work off the bad mood or just be busy or something.  Only after the face do I think it might be nice to have a scarf, or even something other than jeans, sneakers, and a light jacket on.

I wind up back in the house freezing cold and possibly more miserable than before because of it but figure a big oversize cocoa will be awesome to turn things around.  Worked for a while I guess, but it wasn't really a better day and then I get this awesome furious text message from my brother tonight.

I was just about to go ask him if he wanted to play a video game or something, and I get a text that's essentially this patronizing ""Next time you want to talk shit about me, don't.  If you do, don't let me hear it.  And have a clue what you're talking about.  But feel free to blast me some more to your friend.""

The context here is that he's been home for Thanksgiving and brought his ps3 to play Modern Warfare which means I get to listen to his e-rage non-stop; some of which gets fairly offensive and ridiculous, not to mention is just overall repetitive bullshit: ""OMFG AM I SHOOTING BLANKS!?""  ""ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?""  It gets old...<b>fast</b>.   So I was complaining to a friend on the phone and I had a feeling he might've been eavesdropping- lo and behold an hour after the convo he sends me his angry text.

I don't particularly regret what I said; it's true.  He's obnoxious when he's playing and he's always playing.  I think he's feeling sheepish about it, possibly cause he knows some of the stuff he's said is way out of line and unacceptable (we're talking some racial/sexual slurs at times,) but of course, I feel a little sheepish having been overheard because my intent wasn't to .  I tell him I'm sorry if he feels I blasted him, but he didn't really know what I was saying if he took it so personal (I wasn't really being mean, just complaining about him which led to angry stupid video gamers in general...blah blah blah).

No closure on that however which leaves me still fuming and debating whether or not to feel guilty about upsetting him despite the fact that he never gives a thought to bashing me when opportunity arises...  Two wrongs don't make a right and all that.

No chance I'm going out to shovel more snow though so looks like I'm going to sleep on it and hope he's over it in the morning as well.

I'm Addicted to stress
that's the way that i get things done
if I'm not under pressure then i sleep too long
and i hang around like a bum
i think I'm going nowhere and that makes me nervous

everybody's out to get me but i feel all right
everybody's out to get me but i feel all right
everybody's out to get me but i feel all right
Everybody's thinking 'bout me
its the little things that get you

trying to cut down on my caffeine consumption
so when i get up i just have one cup of coffee
and i like to have another cup of coffee with my breakfast
and on the way to work i like to get a cup of coffee
like the kind of cup of coffee that you get with the donuts
but i never get the donut i just have the cup of coffee
and when i get to work i have a cup of coffee
cause i like to have coffee when I'm talking on the phone
but it usually grows cold and i need to get another cup of coffee
and its lunch, and i have an espresso
and when i get back its not morning anymore so i have
a diet cola and another diet cola
but then I'm feeling fine and I'm feeling pretty sharp
and feeling pretty wired and I'm getting things done
but right about two i get this little tiny migraine
it starts behind my eyes and it moves to the back of my neck
and it moves to the bottom of my spine
but it doesn't get there until 5 or 6 o clock
which is the end of the day so I'm fine!
so I'm fine so I'm fine
except when i have to work late when i have to work late
which i usually do

I'm Addicted to stress
that's the way that i get things done
if I'm not under pressure then i sleep too long
and i hang around like a bum
and i think I'm going nowhere and that makes me nervous

everybodies out to get me, but i feel alright
everybodies out to get me, but i feel alright
everybodies out to get me, but i feel alright
everybodies thinking about me!

((talking to trumpet player))
hey, how ya doing...
looking good...
you been working out? yeah i can tell...
alright... see ya later...

i love to work i love to run i love to play real hard
i love to steal little things from the grocery store
like a piece of bubble gum or sometimes i just stick
my thumb in a peach and leave it there
i love to work i love to run i love to water-ski snowboard
jet ski skydive parasail hanglide rollerblade mountainbike
bungee jump well i mean i'd love to do these things if i ever had the time
i love to work i love to work i love to workout after work
i love to spend a little time with this woman I'm seeing
except uh, we never get the time to spend together
so we call each other up and we talk about work
but i think id really love is to get up by myself on a tiny little island
in the middle of the ocean with just me a book and a cellular phone
and a personal computer in case something came up
and i'd eat and i'd drink and i'd run and i'd sleep
and i wouldn't do nothing but swim all day
except ya know, my beeper doesn't work underwater
where there are sharks! where there are sharks! where there are sharks!
and there's this kind of anemone that sticks in your foot
and the poison goes up to your brain and you die
and sand fleas! sand fleas! yuck!
but actually i think would be really relaxing
just me by myself in the middle of the ocean
and thats what i'd really like to do more than anything else
except i'd probably hate it

I'm Addicted to stress
its the way that i get things done
if I'm not under pressure then i sleep too long
and i hang around like a bum

"event","So I'm 98% sure I'm going to work tonight and turning in my two-weeks notice.  Do I have another job lined up?  No.  Will people think it's a mistake?  Of course.  But it's never stopped me before and this job is seriously hell.

I worked at the shop after highschool and while it was a decent enough job, there were some <i>experiences</i> had that made me swear I'd never go back.  The owner of course loved me, which I guess means he at least saw I was a good worker and reliable and all, and always offered me a job on weekends or whenever I needed money or whatever.  Always turned him down of course and explained I was done with waitressing <b>forever</b>.

So after graduating from college and being without a job for months, when he offered me a ""Management"" job for his second, smaller location, I halfheartedly said I'd consider.  That opened up a slew of ""do it for the experience,"" ""get some money out of it,"" ""it'll look good on your resume"" types of advice and pressure from family and friends.

Of course they're right on those counts, but no one understood the sheer stupidity of this store and it's owner.  They never had to work in the conditions I did after high school, never got the insider's look of how this place is run and the ignorance, chaos, and generally illegal practices that somehow defy the fact that the place is still open for business.

Still- I let everyone get the better of my misgivings and put some faith in the fact that the store would be separate from the main location, and I'd be in charge.  

In the three-four months I've worked there now, I have done a lot of great things.  I got the store in shape, priced all the items in it, cleaned it up, decorated, got the employees on the same page, created operating procedures and practices where there were none, got things labeled, revised the menu, etc etc etc...

But the job has still, predictably, been a nightmare.  I mean, there are worse jobs I know, and I do have the luxury of scheduling myself and those little perks here and there...  But the general stress of the position, and the stupid/bad positions the Owner constantly puts me in has become too much.

Everyday is crisis management at this place.  The Owner is responsible for delivering food to us every morning and generally doesn't fulfill this duty.  We are constantly lacking menu items, things to sell, baked goods, pastries...  The things people COME IN FOR.  He has refused to get me coffee products we badly need as technically the store I manage is a ""CAFE.""  He has failed to get me uniforms for the staff (he has t-shirts for the stores but didn't bring me more than 4 shirts in 2 sizes leaving the majority of my staff without one)...

Then he has the gall to tell me to bring in more business.  I <i>have</i>.  He loses it.  How can he expect repeat business if we don't have a fully stocked kitchen, well-equipped coffee bar, and freshly filled pastry case <B>EVERY</B> DAMN DAY.

Yesterday he sent me over the edge by accusing me of not ""keeping the books"" when he has never once mentioned my need to do this or taught me how or likewise.  He decided the closing paperwork, which was in place long before I came to this store, was completely wrong and useless.  He wants me to manually go through every day's register tape- which is not only a completely unreasonable task, but impractical and serves no purpose.  Beyond that, when I started this job and asked if we should be saving the register tape he specifically told me to toss them.

He threw me into this position and has given little support and zero training.  He says we need to do ""more more more"" but provides ""less less less.""  The guy wanted me to take all the employee's hourly shifts and work them myself because he pays me salary anyway, he'd rather not pay employees too.

He's lining his pockets and cutting corners every way he can and I expected no less.  But I can't stand for it anymore.

I'm sick of being told to always ""wait things out,"" and to ""hang in there,"" or even to be ""reasonable.""  People don't know the situation, they spew these lines at me because it sounds like common sense; not because they really believe it or really tried to understand.

This job is an effing joke and I knew it would be.  No one listened then, and no one will listen now.  But I've had it with taking the short end of the stick because of everyone else's ill-conceived advice.  I'm out.

And you know what?  -I'm going to get a job I <i>deserve</i> for once."

Goodnight, my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu
lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me

Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on...
They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be"

"event","The job thing is really starting to wear on me in a bad way.  It's typical for me to act indifferent, nonchalant, whatever, and that makes my family and such think that I'm not even bothering...

The fact is, I do bother.  I look everyday and only wind up more frustrated and confused.  I don't find what I'm looking for, which makes me think I don't know <i>what</i> to look for.  I'm not sure there's an attainable job for me out there somewhere.  If there is I'm not ambitious or I just don't care enough to find it and I'm afraid of committing to a job anyway.

The ones that do strike an interest and apply to, I get the ""You are qualified but not AS qualified as someone else that applied,"" which I dunno how the hell that works when it's ENTRY-LEVEL.

There's something that's pissed me off as well, these jobs, they say ""entry-level"" or ""high-school education"" and then they still expect X amount of years of experience?  W-T-F?  Seriously, no offense, but get over your goddamnselves.  A job isn't THAT hard.  People can be TRAINED.  I mean, I've looked at Administrative Assistant positions, which is basically a glorified Secretary...and they're like ""need at least 3 years experience!""  For WHAT?  Filing?  Microsoft Office?  Answering an effing phone?

Don't even get me started on internships either.  Those are the biggest crock I've ever heard of.  Free labor?  Did I get a degree in ""fetching coffee?""  A guy my family knows at the CBS news station in Denver says I could get an internship if I can enroll at community college and get credit for it..  And my family was like DO IT DO IT!  Does it not seem incredibly unjust to ask me to do that?  I got my college credits already.  I earned my degree.  Technically I'm now supposed to be QUALIFIED for jobs.  -Not college-credit-earning internships.  It's insulting to me and no one could ever seem grasp that concept...

But that's not my problem right now.

I went back to an old job the other day, an Italian restaurant/bakery I worked at, and was offered the opportunity to manage a second location.  Manage.  To me that implies a lot more time and effort than I want to bother with, and it's a field I couldn't give a crap less about.  Hello?  I got a degree a few months back doesn't anyone give a shit about that thing I wasted all the time and money for?  I could've managed this place outta high school if I'd effing wanted to...

Anyhow everyone I've told thinks I should just do it and I can understand why.  I have been out of work too long and it'll start to look bad on a resume, I could use the money, I could use the ""title,"" and I could use the time out of the house I guess too...

But I also have to consider: This is a restaurant.  I am so sick and tired of the restaurant/food industry.  I want to be moving into media, or PR, or HR.   Management could help HR, but will get me nowhere fast with media or PR...  And besides that, WHEN will I ever start in media or PR if I don't do it RIGHT out of college.

People aren't being realistic when they tell me I can do this for however long and THEN hop on in to my field of choice.  That's how people get stuck in jobs/careers they hate.  They think it's a temporary thing, or that they can start ""later,"" at their ""convenience.""  

That's why there's so much pressure on me to start an entry-level job out of college... Because that's when your education is supposed to be relevant right?  That window doesn't last forever...  And now m'just adding to my craptacular list of ""food/service industry"" experience

And no one's listening to me when I say I'm concerned about it.  I feel like everyone just wants me to get a damn job at this point that my feelings on the whole thing are being undermined.  Yes, I realize that I can be cynical and self-defeating because I'm not ready to commit/grow-up whatever... but I HATE when I actually share my feelings with someone and they just want to throw logic in my face as a response.

I am smart. I know the logic.  That is why I'm bothered.  Because I know the logic but I also know how I feel about it.  Why is that hard to get?

Anyhow, I know 90% odds are I'll take the job.  And then I'm going to be walking that line of losing what little direction I had at getting something a job in something I wanted.  Because if I can't really start now, I know I won't start later.

I'm terrified I will grow up and become everything I never wanted to be."

""It is a well known fact that warriors and wizards do not get along, because one side considers the other side to be a collection of bloodthirsty idiots who can't walk and think at the same time, while the other side is naturally suspicious of a body of men who mumble a lot and wear long dresses. Oh, say the wizards, if we're going to be like that, then, what about all those studded collars and oiled muscles down at the Young Men's Pagan Association? To which the heroes reply, that's a pretty good allegation coming from a bunch of wimpsoes who won't go near a woman on account, can you believe it, of their mystical power being sort of drained out. Right, say the wizards, that just about does it, you and your leather posing pouches. Oh yeah, say the heroes, why don't you . . . And so on."""

The Way I Am - Ingrid Michaelson

If you were falling, then I would catch you.
You need a light, I'd find a match.

Cuz I love the way you say good morning.
And you take me the way I am.

If you are chilly, here take my sweater.
Your head is aching, I'll make it better.

Cuz I love the way you call me baby.
And you take me the way I am.

I'd buy you Rogaine if you start losing all your hair.
Sew on patches to all you tear.

Cuz I love you more than I could ever promise.
And you take me the way I am.
You take me the way I am.
You take me the way I am."

It's the fact that advertisements for toys are so PAINFULLY polarized by sex.  There are toys for <font color=""#ff00ff"">GIRLS</font> and there are toys for <font color=""#0000ff"">BOYS</font>.  And the disparities between the two are ridiculous.

Just pay a little closer attention the next time one of those obnoxious commercials come on.  Look at what exactly they pitch to each set of kids, and what gender of kids are specifically playing with the toy in each...  And if the obvious bat doesn't bash your face in, watch how overly-emphasized ""pink and blue"" become in all the backgrounds and text and such.   

Toy kitchens, cars, robots, vanities, baby dolls, nerf guns...  It <i>really</i> bothers me.

-What scares me further, is the notion that if by whatever chance I wind up having kids in the future- how the hell will I deter them from being influenced by all this crap?  I'd never want muh kids to be limited in what they can play with or do based on their sex.  That's straight up bullshit.

"event","I've been seriously out of sorts lately.

Don't like to QQ (that's cry in gamer-talk for you nubs), but I'm really...dissatisfied with things.

The job search is a constant frustration.  I openly admit that my search has been half-assed/half-hearted but I also realize its because when I do look- I find jack shit.  If I can't enjoy working, I'd at least like to be a little interested in what I'm doing...

I now find myself considering a coffee-shop job in the meantime, which I hate the idea of, or...well keep looking aimlessly now that I feel like giving up on finding something related to what I want to do.

Working at a coffee shop wouldn't be so bad for some cash on the side- with loans coming up, holidays on the way, and a dead laptop on my hands... I definitely need it.  But I detest the idea of working with local high skoolers, or having to serve Starfucks to the primadonnas during their lunchbreaks.  Yeah, harsh.

I definitely miss being around my own age group.  Not that I liked a whole lot of the college-crowd, but at least there were people <i>beginning</i> to show signs of independent thought up there.

And I'm definitely feeling isolated here.  Friends are all off doing job-type things in other states or still in school, and I'm used to walking across the street for a video-game tournament or a slurpee run or hot-tubbing at the apartments or...whatever.

I miss having someone to grab a cup of coffee with when I could manage between work and school, and I miss having a bank account I didn't think twice about doing so with.

At home m'not very active- there's really nothing to do.  I checked into the local activity centers, YMCAs and the like and there's no way I can afford them.  I hate running with a passion- and the weather's turning cold anyhow...

I need another soccer league to join.  At least when I was playing a match, I was being active and felt good about it, but had too much fun to think about it.  Working-out is such bullshit, I don't know why everyone thinks that's the only way to be fit, I think rec sports need a much bigger emphasis cause running on a treadmill or lifting weights or whatever for 40 mins is lame shit.

So there's that little rant I guess, and don't get me wrong, m'not lookin for sympathy this is more just airing out my frustrations.  Point blank, I feel kinda worthless anymore and inactive.

And I've had more advice than I can swallow so really guys- save it.  I'm not having a ""my life is going nowhere"" freak-out deserving of kind reassurances, I'm just having a ""my life isn't moving as fast as I want it to"" lash-out."

"event","R.I.P. My laptop

It was your time to go apparently but still all too soon.

The thing stopped recognizing the power cord and thus- died.  I replaced the AC Adapter, the power cord, and even went so far as to open up the laptop and check to see if anything had come loose or become obstructed but no luck.

It's not so bad really- aside from the fact that my laptop is useless now and I did try to take care of it and did put some money into upgrades and such...  But I have an external harddrive so I should be able to keep my data fine.  And it was to be expected after 4-5 years.

I'm just glad it lasted through school where it was my only computer access and you know- I'd intended to use it anyway.

Now that I'm out I dont really need something so portable, and I've been wanting a new desktop anyhow... (the better to run WoW with my dear...)  Not to mention desktops are much easier to upgrade.

I've wanted to customize a computer/build it myself for a while, but the idea was to do this stuff AFTER I got a job...

So that's the trick of it all.  I'm on my parents desktop which leads to issues a lot, and it's nice to be able to get on my own system besides, but I'm going to have to try to hold out till I get some money comin again...  Maybe Thanksgiving sales or something will let me get one sooner?

Can't help but think it died as a means of motivating me to take my job search a little more seriously-  but I'm not all that motivated truth be told and still all too lost in the hunt.  If anything, I'm more tempted to grab my old job or take up at one of the local coffee shops now...just to get some cash flow again in the meantime.

Not a terrible idea, save for the fact that I'm worried I'll get complacent.  ""I got this job and I pocket all my money (save for loan payments) so why stress over that whole 'career' thing again...""

True, there are easy ones, but I got hard ones too- and further, I could pretty much answer almost anything my opponents are ever asked, so its really not fair to undermine my sweet sweet victory just because I happen to have enough useless knowledge to p0wn face in those games.  Doesn't it also make sense that if I rarely have to pass turns because I get so many right, that it would seem I answer ""more"" easy questions, but in reality it's just a matter of proportion.  They get just as many easy ones, they just get few of them because they don't answer as many questions total?

Yes, I'm aware I'm rambling.

I don't have much to say...  I'm actually pretty overwhelmed with some thoughts right now, but one is something I don't want to validate in writing and another is WoW guild-drama bullshit that I swore I wouldn't continue to tolerate- let alone get to me to the point that I'd even mention it in my sporadically used LJ...

Good job me.

I want to gear down and get a job but I'm afraid I just don't know what else I can do that I haven't been doing.  I haven't searched Monster and such as much as I probably could've but that's because I don't trust them.  The internet is basically a big black hole.  You put shit up and fuck if anyone actually reads it.  The lack of comments in my LJ is basic proof of such.  The only reason it goes up is to obviously make a show out of one's thoughts and life events and such for others to see...

But really- Who the f posts on Monster and the like?  It just seems to me that a reputable company is probably advertising job positions internally, and on their own websites.  They don't need to go to the internet-version of the Classified pages...  For every job on an internet job building site, I figure there's about 40 people within that company already aware and applying anyway.

I'd rather go straight to the company (site) but the problem with that is finding the companies.  What exists where?  Why is there no handy directory of all the companies related to my interests located within 60 miles of my home so that I can simply go down the list?

Maybe I just need more contacts- or I need to better use the few I have...

I guess that's one way I can gear down this weekend.  A couple emails are overdue for ""godpleasehelpme"" purposes, though they of course will be worded much more clever and convincing-like.

It's a little rough right now being graduated and knowing everyone is back in college town, hanging in apartments, doing their own thing...and I'm still stuck with the parents essentially isolated from anything that even resembles what was once my unreliable social life.

I have to say though, knowing they have to go back to classes, take exams, and most importantly WRITE PAGES UPON PAGES OF MEANINGLESS ROT ESSAYS, does not conjure any feelings of envy.

If that's the tradeoff- freedom in FoCo for more intellectual suicide, then I guess I'm pretty damn happy not to go back after all.

See ya suckas."

"event","<P>2day was a shitty day. K actually this afternoon was okay...2night was shitty. I basically just watched tv 2day..u know lazed around n just relaxed. It was nice. Then I went 2 practice...it wasnt so great. I played a lil but my leg hurt n I had 2 sit down. I wish Charles had just said that I couldnt play...sure it would still b torture but it's worse now cuz I'm allowed 2 play but it hurts so I cant really. I cant explain why its worse but it just is...u would understand if you were going through it. I feel bad 4 complaining bout it cuz Chelsea's position is way worse...shes out all year. I would go nuts if I couldn't play soccer 4 that long. They would have to put me on drugz..no joke. </P>
<P><FONT size=4><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got called 4 my in-car finally!!!</EM></FONT></P>
<P>This Saturday is gonna b so much fun...cept 4 tha fact that Ive gotta get up @ 7:30 for my game which I wont play in much. But me, David, Thomas n Rena are all gonna do something...probably watch a movie at my house or wutever. It doesnt sound like nething special but its gonna b great. Im in like kiss denial...if theres such thing LoL. Ever since David kissed me while he was here n when he's around thats all I think about...it was really good! LoL. All I've gotta say is I hope tha second on is better...=)</P>

Nikki was being a brat 2 cuz shes scared of mosquitoes. Such a loser. Right now Im so sore...ive got a killer sun burn on my shoulders n it hurts!! I dont even have ne of that ice gel stuff either. It would b nice 2 have at the moment. I remember in grade 8....i think it was 8...newayz i remember when Rena got a really bad burn n she made me rub that stuff on her back till 2 in tha morning. It was so <U>gross</U> cuz at the end i had a layer of her skin on my hand.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Right now theres shit all 2 do. I could study 4 pre-cal...but everybody knows I hate studying. Ill do it 2morrow inbetween getting stuck with needles...going 2 my soccer game...n getting my compression shorts. Damn...im sick of these busy days. 2day wasnt that busy but I didnt get 2 stay home n just relax. One day this week thats all im gonna do. Im determined!!!</P>

"event","<P>Well 2day I had my soccer car wash. I never want 2 wash another car again. She we made a lot of money but it was labor! N some of the customers were kinda bitchy. Nick n his friend Shane showed up just like they said they would. I have realized I only want 2 b Nicks friend...he kept touching me 2day n he was getting on my nerves. I put most of my energy into avoiding him. Liza talked 2 me as if nothing was different...which is good.&nbsp;She is appearently mad at me but is more sad. At least that's wut Chelsea says. Wutever I don't care. She'll eventually get over it.</P>
<P>Newayz thats enuff bout my love life...if u even wanna call it a love life. Right now im at my dad's new place. The house is pretty big. Cept its in&nbsp;this lil town..Ile De Chene or something like that. Its bout 10 minutes outside of city...kinda by the Mint. It's nice...but it's a lil 2 quiet 4 me. I gotta meet some ppl my age in this town. The good part bout him living here is that im finally gonna get the dirt bike he always promised me!! I cant wait till I get it. And next summer when I can drive on my own he said that I bring ppl with me here n we can camp out in the backyard n have a bon fire. The only thing is tho Ive gotta bring my own booze. LoL my dad is great..he doesnt really care if I drink n im not quite 18. Ah gonna have great timez next summer...but I better have great timez this summer. But now im out....outties!! LoL.</P>"

"event","Well..its been one week since I've last posted..I don't think anybody is reading my blog...anyway...Its strange how one moment I listen to heavy metal like Tool, System of a Down, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Rage against the Machine etc... and one moment I'm listening to extreme stuff like Carcass, Opeth and then an other time I'm listening to psychedelic stuff like Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree..some other time ..I'm in the Grunge mood..if you know what I mean..listening to Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Silverchair...and finally sometimes (like right now!) when I'm listening to classic rock like Rush, Dire Straits, Deep Purple, Dave Matthews Band, Coldplay...(yes! I consider DMB and Coldplay classic rock!). I'm always in this constant Soul Searching ..to identify myself with some kind of music. For example, if someone asked me what my favourite band is..I wouldn't be able to answer it right now..I would never be able to answer the question I guess.. one thing I can say is that I like serious music making...people who are serious about making music...now I'm getting all philosophical and stuff :) I've read a few books recently .. Catch 22, Jurassic Park, Asterix and Son(!)..I've just started reading Foucault's Pendulum. I'm kind of giving finishing touches to my summer project...and with the semester beginnning in 1 week or so...I'm finally relieved of all the boredom. Vikas finally brought the Hyderabad Blues 2 soundtrack today. I've been listening to the theme song..""Dil Pe Mat Lo Haath Mein Lo..."" by a Hyderabadi rock band called Alter Egoz...Its damn funny with all the Hydi lingo..and also quite a piece of music..some very good guitar work in there...c ya later!"

"event","Woke up at 11:30. Quite some time since I've last posted. Well, it was a rather uninteresting last week. The only useful thing I did was to find a nice place to eat (courtesy : Nikhil). We were supposed to go on a trek to Muhali but it got cancelled....and I was listening to some really dreadful music until I came across this band (courtesy: Vikas Reddy) called Carcass yesterday ..they kick a**..some very good guitar solos in their album Swansong (which also happens to be their last studio album..these goddamn egoistic rock-stars...never understand why they break up). I hope to do something interesting this coming week."

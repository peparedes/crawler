PS--A few nights ago I went and saw Harry Potter with Muffin, and it was GREAT! Granted, the books are WAY better, but I have to say that the most recent movie was done quite well. I also went and saw Rent with Zak and Muffin on our double date. It was tons of fun, Zak picked me up and paid for me and even held my hand during the sad parts of the movie. I can't wait for our next date...yay! ;-)"

After filling out paperwork this morning, I went to Dollar Tree to get Halloween decorations. For those of you who don't know, Halloween is my favorite holiday. I love getting dressed up and having a great time...it's so much fun! I also enjoy making decorations and getting the house all decked out in black and orange. My friend Charlie helped me to make plastic bag ghosts...they look kinda ghetto, but they are cute! Here at 26 Harrison, we are planning a huge Halloween bash near the end of the month, which makes me very happy. :-)

"event","I've been looking forward to this weekend, since it's the only weekend I've had off from work in quite some time, and will probably be the only weekend I'll get off for awhile. But of course, as things work out, absolutely no one is around to hang out with...my roommates are both gone, my friends from the marching band are gone (trip weekend), some of my friends are sick with the cold that's been going around, and still others are attending weddings, meetings, or are too tired to do anything. I just wanna go out for a night and do something fun...I don't care if it entails bowling, pool, food, drinking, dancing, cards, or even just hanging around and talking. I feel like such a loser...I just sat here and cried for about two minutes over the fact that I can't find anyone to hang out with...it's pathetic.  It's still early, though...only around 9:15....so maybe I'll just shower and dress and head out for awhile on my own.

 Not really sure where I'm gonna go, though...hanging out places alone isn't exactly a lot of fun or even safe. Last night I thought I might go to Classics for awhile by myself (again, couldn't find anyone to go with me), but when I got there, four guys came up to my car and asked me to roll down my window...they then proceeded to ask me for a ride...no fucking way am I gonna give you drunk creeps a ride...I don't care how fricken hot you are or how much money you're willing to pay for ""gas"" money...I'd probably end up dead somewhere in the bushes. And so, I didn't even bother going into the pool hall...I ended up leaving, too afraid they'd come in and bother me, or follow me back to my car when I left. Fuck that.

Well anyway, guess I'm gonna try and find something to entertain myself with tonight...thought about drinking, but drinking alone isn't very exciting...

Jen :o(

PS- I'm sad, not depressed. Things could be a lot worse. After working with the life skills students at the high school, I now realize just how fortunate I am to be living the life I have been blessed with. I can dress myself, use the bathroom by myself, eat food without assitance from others or a feeding tube, walk across the room without difficulty, put a cap back on a marker...it's amazing the types of things most of us take for granted."

Here you've been thinking that you've lost touch, you don't have much in common and that it was time to let this friendship go gently into that good night? Well, hold your horses, however -- that old friend may just surprise you by saying or doing something that proves that there's plenty of mileage in this thing yet. The stars are all about sparking communication and connection in areas where you'd least expect it.


This seems to have definitely happened with someone whom I once cared for a great deal. Just when I was beginning to think that I should let our friendship go, on his terms, and just let it settle to nothingness, he makes an effort to say hello...makes the effort to be the initiator of conversation. This makes Jen a very happy girl. Granted, I still sometimes wish he would one day tell me he's crazy about me and would do anything to be with me, yet I know it isn't reality. Part of me will always be in love with him...not a lot I can do that can or should change that. But just knowing that he will be there as my friend means a lot.

So, as you've noticed, my recent LJ entries have been happy ones..and I'm still kinda excited. I would mention more here, but don't want to jinx anything.

With an interview committee of eight people for a school with only 110 students grade K-8, it was a bit scary. But overall, I rather enjoyed the experience and didn't feel all that intimidated. However, I don't thin kI got the job, and quite honestly, I'm fine by that.

Wth a recently-renovated one-room school and a class size of three students (ranging from K-8), this could be the experience of a lifetime. It intrigues me, the challenge of it all, yet I'm not entirely positive I could handle living each and every day on an island with a population of 45 or 50 people in the winter. Another major drawback is that the ferry service only runs three times a month in the summer, and once a month in the winter. So, I'd basically be stuck there. Besides the lack of an exciting social life, what happens when someone needs to go to the hospital? I read that one may hire a pilot to go to the mainland, but I imagine that would be incredibly expensive. Yet, the idea of teaching and living on an island such as this intrigues me. Afterall, how many people in the year 2005 can say they've taught in a one-room schoolhouse? WAY cool.


As for my current job, I absolutely love it. I like the job, I like the environment, I like the people. Well, most of the people anyway. I can honestly say I am not fond of the other bartender they have hired, as he's cocky and arrogant--thinks he's God's gift or something. He's constantly making me feel like I'm not as good as him, telling the members of the club that he's the ""new Todd"" (current bartender who's been there for 5 years), and that I'm just there to ""fill in"" when he (the new guy) is not around. Sorry dude, but I'm not second rate to you, so stop treating me like I am. Yesterday I ended up at the edge of my rope and told the manager everything that had been bothering me about this new guy. As it turns out, not many people seem to like him, so at least I'm not alone in my feelings.


Well anyway, time to go and enjoy my day off. I'm probably going to the gym, going outside to get some sun (if it decides to come out!), get my hair cut, and apply for more teaching jobs. :-)

"event","For those of you who don't read my AIM profile, I had an interview today for a bartending/waitstaff position at the Penobscot Valley Country Club. I am SO relieved--I got the job! And the best part is that I'll be getting paid quite handsomely, too. $5.25 an hour plus 15% gratiuity during regular functons--$11.00 an hour for weddings and banquet functions (no gratiuity). It's also pretty sweet because it's air-conditioned--not something I've always had in past summer jobs. ;-)

I just did a whole sinkful of dishes, plus put away everything that was sitting in the dishwasher. I also cleaned up all the nasty trash that had been strewn around our yard (and neighborhood!) by a cute, little, mischevious racoon and some annoying crows. But unfortunately, both Sara and I forgot to put out this week's trash for the garbage truck this morning--hopefully it won't start to smell.

Hmm...so what else? Besides desperately needing to clean up my room from random laundry pieces thrown on the floor and teacher applications spread about, I think today I'm gonna head over to campus for some free food around 5. My sister Julie has orientation today and tomorrow, so she and my mom are gonna be on campus, and have asked me to come on over for food. It's free, so why not? I think the most valuable lesson I learned while in college is to never turn down anything free (well, with a few exceptions, but ya know what I mean). So yeah..dried out commons burgers near the river...sure beats my daily mac and cheese or ramen! :-)

Okay, I'm outta things to say...peace out.

Other places will take me, but I first have to go through a credit check, then a medical history check, then I have to pay upfront before services are rendered. Unfortunately, I don't have the cash to pay upfront--nor can I even afford a payment plan with my student loans repayments starting next month. I have finished completing my application for MaineCare, but can't get an appointment until next week.

This sucks so incredibly much. I had so many things I wanted to do today, such as visit the classrooms I student taught for (today is the last day of school). I had been planning on visiting them for quite some time, and now I won't be able to go. Tomorrow is my sister's graduation party, and I can't go down there because I can't drive. I can't drive, because I can't see more than six inches in front of me (typing this oiut is taking me forever--hopefully everything is spelled and typed correctly).

I need money, and badly. I'm incredibly poor right now, as I have a lot of bills to pay with very little money to pay them with. As much as I hate to, I'm reapplying for MaineCare and food stamps. Hopefully I'll be eligible, because otherwise without a job bringing in income, I won't be buying groceries for the next few months. I'm also applying for FreeCare through EMMC, just in case my MaineCare request is denied. No matter what, I need to get my eyes checked out, and soon. Tonight my vision has been getting worse in my left eye, though I've tried not to think about it, hoping it wil just go away.

I'm really sick of making out applications. They all want the same information, over and over and over again. Talking with Keith makes me feel a little bit better, since he and I are in the same spot right now as far as full-time teaching jobs go. It's great to have someone to sympathize with.

Ugh...I REALLY can't see clearly out of my left eye. Just trying to read what I'm typing is a chore. When I cover my right eye, I realize that the only things I can see on the screen are black lines where the words should be. I'm really getting worried...in fact, I can actually say I'm <i>scared</i>.

"event","Ugh, I'm sick. At first I thought it was my allergies, but now I'm thinking it's probably a cold. Stuffy head, runny nose, cough, plugged ears, congestion, and a general feeling of blah. The worst part is that I also think I have an eye infection of some type-- for two days in a row I've had to wear sunglasses inside because the light is painful to my eyes, and my left eye keeps watering almost non-stop. When I take my contacts out, the sensitivity to light increases, and my eyes water even more. The only way I can describe the way they feel is how it feels when you get soap in your eyes--almost a stinging sensation, without the urge to rub them. The sensitivity seems to last a few hours, then I'm able to take my sunglasses off and look around normally, with the exception that my left eye sees everything blurry. I'm hoping it just goes away on it's own and it's nothing serious, because I don't have health insurance, I'm currently jobless, and certainly can't afford any medical or prescription bills.

Here's a short list of the things I did today (and not necessarily in the order in which they occurred):

- Filled out summer job applications
- Ate two strawberry Pop Tarts (with frosting)
- Dropped a full roll of toilet paper into the toilet
- Ate two slices of pepperoni pizza
- Took a shower
- Got a 30 minute massage at Pierre's School of Massage
- Filled out teacher applications
- Attempted to fix my roommates' Internet connections (and failed)
- Had a cat follow Keith, James, and me down the road
- Took a nap


So as you can see, my day was a typical, ""interesting"" day. Yay.

I've been trying to figure out what is wrong with Justin and Sara's Internet connections--they were both working fine until the early evening. Ideas, anyone??

Well, that's it for now...will type more later (unless I too lose my Internet connection).

During the two weeks of rain we had and not having any basic phone, internet, or cable at my place, I've busied myself with other things. I'm currently in book four of Harry Potter (after refusing to read the books after all the hype about them, I've finally given in---they are every bit as wonderful as they have been made out to be!!), I'm learning guitar again (slowly, but surely...my left-hand fingers are calloused and numb), and I've been working on my scrapbook. As soon as I get some money (which won't be for awhile...I still don't have a job), I want to work on a sewing project of some type.

Does anyone have some summer job ideas? I need something desperately, and FAST. I've applied to a lot of places and have checked back, but have still heard nothing. :-(

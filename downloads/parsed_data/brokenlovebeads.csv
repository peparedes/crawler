"event","The semester is almost over, which means I have way to much work to do! I have three different projects going right now... fortunately two of them are related.

Ay. I cannot wait for summer. I can just focus on work (if I find a job, haha), improve my shitty GRE score, and explore what I want to write about in my thesis. 

Picking a topic should be so easy, but it really isn't... it's something that you have to sit with and work on for months upon months.... I want to create something truly interesting.... I want to tell interesting stories. Ugh. I think that I am just torn between topics.

I'm thinking about going on to a PhD program after I finish my masters. I know that I should continue with school, because I really want to teach and write. But I keep thinking about being in school for another 4 years.... which is kind of... well, I love school, but I feel like almost every other aspect of my life is on hold because of it. I'll probably do it though. I'm looking into MIT and UMass Boston... I don't want to regret not trying for it. 

I think I will do it this way... if I can get into the programs that I like in either of these schools (and get funded), then I will continue. If I do not get in, then it is not meant to be!

This is a very boring post.

I went dancing a few weeks ago. I have always hated dancing, because I felt way to self conscious, but I actually had an amazing time... the only good thing about getting old, I think, is getting over silly self-consciousness. Yes. It was fun. I felt very alive and less in my head."

Our apartment is truly amazing.... the nicest apartment I have ever lived in. 

Every other apartment I have ever lived in was grungy and old. 
This building may be old... not sure... but our apartment was redone a year ago, so it is really, really, nice. 

Our cats have been getting along so much better. The past few months were hellish at times, because they would fight so much and Leela became a very anxious cat. Now all they do is cuddle and make out. They have over double the space to play.... even though they are mostly being lazy and staying in the same room. 

In other news, I want a kitten... a little black, boy, kitten.

and

I start work and school next week.
I just found out that I will be doing some sort of researching for GEAR UP Lowell. It seems like a really cool project. They have been following the same group of middle school students (now in high school) and their parents. They offer tutoring and support to them, with the ultimate goal being that as many of these kids as possible go into a 2 or 4 year college program. Good stuff. 

and


I really recommend watching the documentary ""King Corn."" It is about the corn industry in the US, but it is made in a very clever fashion. It isn't super heavy, but I have been thinking a lot about it since I watched it. If you have netflix you can watch it instantly online. Check it!"

I have wanted to see them play for years and years... now I can't wait to see them again.

We left before they came back onstage and played three more songs. I missed Idioteque, which is too bad, but I'm glad we left.

It was at Comcast hell concert center, so some of my friends who went (and stayed until the very end) were stuck there until 1:30am- trying to get out of the parking lot. Kristin and I got back to Salem by 11:30pm.

We still have not moved into our Salem apartment yet. I have one more shift left on Thursday.. it feels so weird because I have worked there for almost four years, but I feel very free to be leaving. As much as I care for my coworkers and some of the mental clients, this has never been my dream job. It's been such a repetitive mess- give people their meds, clean up after them, take them out to buy cigarettes, watch them make some positive changes, and then watch them go back to the way that they were... It's been the best job that I have ever had, but I have gotten to the point where I hate it. 

I have been feeling pretty damn good lately... I think it was the Radiohead show, the move, and leaving my current job. 

Kristin still has about a week and a half left, but I think that we might move our stuff next week... hopefully! I just want to get the moving part over with."

"event","Studying economics at USM really taught me so much about the past and present. 
What really scares me is how much the income inequality of today resembles that of the 1920's and 30's, where a majority of wealth was held in the hands of the few. 

When you look at the data today, the incomes of 1% of the US population has skyrocketed, while that of the majority has flatlined or decreased. Just the other day there was an article on the salaries of CEOs, which continues to climb significantly, despite the slow economy and decreasing wages of ordinary Americans. 

Pundits tell us that it's immigrants, liberals, or the price of oil taking money out of the pockets of Americans. However the real cause for the increasing income disparity is the lack of labor power in the US. During the New Deal and up until the 60's, union membership was at it's highest. Even workers who were not in unions benefited from union membership. Companies would offer workers higher wages and benefits to prevent them from unionizing (called Welfare Capitalism). 

Corporations were eventually able to strip labor protections from the American workforce and union membership has shrunk in this country. As union membership has shrunk, labors voice and influence has all but been erased from politics.  

I wrote Obama a letter recently. I knew that he wouldn't read it, but it was something that I needed to write. I told him my fears and my hopes for him. My main fear - that he's another political centrist, putting himself in the middle so as not to upset the right or industries that might line his pockets. My main hope - that he really could and would change this country for the better.

Despite me fears regarding Obama, I know that we need him in office.

McCain is so similar to Bush. He has voted the same way as Bush 89% of the time. An example of McCain's bad policy is his solution for health care, which is to tax health care benefits. Right now we have the ""luxury"" of our health care benefits (if you are lucky enough to have them) being tax free. McCain would like to change this, costing Americans much, much more for health care. Given McCain's propensity towards tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations, I assume that he will do nothing to address income inequality, other than to maintain the status quo. 

I know that some have been disappointed with Obama winning the nomination, but I hope that everyone will eventually stand behind him. We need change in this country and maybe, if we all push Obama to stand up for the majority of us, we will get the change that we want and so deserve. Obama speaks of health care reform and addressing income redistribution. I think that if we make our voices louder than those of corporations and the wealthy elite, we may get these things... but the possibility is only there given that our next President is Obama and not McCain.   

Lastly, one of our fundamental rights as workers in this country is our right to join unions. However there is no teeth to this right. The Employee Free Choice Act would change this, and restore workers' freedom to form unions and bargain with employers. McCain is opposed to this.

So please, if you can spare a small amount of your time, write to your political representatives and urge them to support ""The Employee Free Choice Act."" Whether you can, or want, to join unions, remember that unions improve the working and income conditions for ALL workers. 

Also, If you can spare more than a little time, volunteer for Obama's campaign and try to help him win in November (I am)."

I went to San Diego at the end of August. I had a blast.... yada yada. When I get my computer fixed some day, I'll post some pictures from my trip.

Well, the reason why I am really posting is...

I brought my cat Minnie to the vet today, because she kept going to her litter box, but was unable to pee. She has had a UTI before, so I knew the signs.

Well, I bring her to a new vet and the vet is checking her over. The vet started to really examine her lady parts. She then asked a vet tech to come into the room and look at minnie's lady parts. They then tell Kristin and I that Minnie is a BOY. I have had Minnie for four years and he she has seen three different vets and they have never noticed that my she cat is a he cat!!!!Kristin and I are in shock. I can't look at Minnie the same way!

I guess that I have always wondered why Minnie is so friendly and social. I have always had female kitties and they have always been shy around strangers. Sooo... I'm working on a new name for Minnie... Yeah... weird."

School started less than a month ago, but I feel like I am at the end of the semester... soooo much work!
I went from 4 classes to three, because I felt too overwhelmed.
I dropped my statistics class.. it was an easy choice, because I would have wanted to kill the professor, had I stayed... he reminded me of a cross between Kip from Napoleon Dynamite and Eugene Levy's character in Waiting for Guffman.... really akward.. he seemed really nice, but I still would have killed 'em. So I am taking:
 
Urban economics (lots of urban economic theory   :x  )
Political economy (cool class! The professor is carazy though...femenist, jewish, and man hating maybe? sweet)
Case Study in International management (we're reading books on the end of fossil fuels, climate change, and disease and slums.... a very uplifting class, haha)

I feel like ass today. I think I have the flu... I feel freezing, but my face is really hot. 
I ate spinach a week and a half ago... 
let's take a vote.. does Jenn have ecoli? a. yes     b. no
See and this was at the beginning of the outbreak... I went to my favorite indian restaurant, ordered my favorite meal chana saag (chick peas and spinach).... 
when I got to work and was getting ready to eat my dinner, I remembered.... spinach = death... 
so I debated... 
throw away my absolute favorite meal and the world and live.... or die, happily.... 
so I ate it... The spinach was really cooked though.... to the point when all the nutrients also disappear.

So maybe I just have the flu.

I haden't seen nugget in weeks, but on monday I saw him twice!!!
His fur is changing from brownish to gray.... he's pretty little, compared to the other squirrels.
He won't let people near him... even though it makes me sad as his momma... I'm glad that he's adapting to his wild man life...
AND the second time I saw him that day he had a friend!!! A lady friend maybe? Or a boyfriend? I was squirrel grandkids.

I think that's it for now. I feel like death.

"event","I had a moment of clarity this afternoon, after feeling very emotional and angry throughout this morning. Although it may be simple, and something that many people claim to already know, it felt very real and it woke me up in a big way.

When I have expectations for the people in my life, I am only harming myself.  When you expect something from somebody it means that you are looking for pleasure, in some form or another, from another person; Whether it's a friend and you are going out and you expect to have a good time... or you expect your lover to be a certain way towards you, when your expectations are unmet, we become angry or disappointed. But really, we can only control our own behavior and make our own decisions, so expecting somebody to be a certain way, when we are not in control of their behavior, is completely unreasonable.

Even if we only have good intentions in our expectations, we will still be hurt. So why expect things? I think that it is a behavior that is hard to let go of, because we learn these sorts of things as very young children. At christmas time or birthdays, as young children, we expect to get what we ask for and if we don't, we often hold it against our parents. Also, american culture promotes instant gratification. Everything is based on getting pleasure out of something or another.  It is one thing to have expectations when you are younger, but it seems as if expectations become more and more harmful as we get older. Our expectations often cause us to become bitter and hateful, which in turn, harms ourselves.

I know that it is impossible not to have any expectations, but if we can realize how they harm us, then we can be more consious of it and in more control of our emotions. We will turn to ourselves more for what we need, instead of looking for happiness from the outside."

"event","Kristin and I bought bikes. Kristin's is really fancypants and mine isn't. However, it is lime green and still a very nice bike.

Last tuesday, I moved Nugget and his cage outside to start the transition. Then on friday I let him out of his cage, because he was going crazy from being locked up. I didn't expect him to be so brave and take off, but he did. He spent hours at the top of a tall tree and he wouldn't come down. Then I rode my old bike to town to get the mail and when I came back I saw him run into the woods   :(. I searched and searched for him for hours. Then the next day my mom saw him, but he wouldn't really go near her. I thought that I saw him too, but he wouldn't com close. So I hung his home up in a tree, hoping that he would see it and retrieve the nuts I put inside... I wanted him to have shelter and a place to be safe... I thought that I would never be close to him again. Though, I new tht it might happen, I was still really sad about it and cried. 

WELL. I'm at work and Kristin stayed home sick. I guess she heard some noise on the screened in porch and thought that it was our cats trying to escape, but it was NUGGET!!! He came back. She opened the front door and he strolled in with his cute little squirrel self. I guess that he was starving, because he pigged out on avocado, nuts, and puppy formula. He also was very thirsty. Then he laid down on one of the chairs. I don'tknow how much he has slept, since he hasen't built a nest or anything. Now he is sleeping in the closet. I can't wait to go home and see him. I want some squirrel kisses! I have missed him so."

So that made me reallllllyyyyy excited, because I started the fast last wednesday night. I called my boss/ fasting buddy! She ended her fast last night. She's done the fast a few times, but had some trouble this time... though 6 days is still great. As soon as I got off the phone, 20 minutes ago, I grabbed an orange and attacked it. I spit out the pulp to be gentle to my stomach, but it was AMAZING!!!! I wasen't that excited about eating yet mre citrus fruit, but it was soooo good. I'm going to see if my stomach hurts and maybe I can eat some of the soup I made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Though the fast has been so rough at times, I feel great now. I woke up with a really clear head this morning.... I mean REALLY clear... I felt really high off life. I feel balanced and healthy. My diet is normally very healthy. I eat seafood and dairy, but no other animal products and I eat loads of veggies every day... but now I feel even better! I went running this morning. Yeah... all is good!

I would recommend this fast! If you can get past the first three days, which are brutal, it really isn't so bad. Day 6 and day 7 (today), were by far the best.

It's so weird.
I read that doing this fast can often allow your body to really heal past injuries.

Then I drank some of the lemon/cayenne/syrup mixture and I felt revived again.
I may not do the full 10 days... saying that makes me feel better at this moment... even if I make it.
If I can make it through tomorrow, I think it will get easier.

I realize now how social ""food"" is and how much people in this country eat (including myself). I had an hour to kill in Portland and normally I would get coffee and some yummy sugary treat, but today I just went to Borders. I was looking forward to drinking some mint tea, but the cafe was being renuvated or something. 
I have also become aware of how many food commercials on tv and radio.

If anything this is a lesson in will power, but hopefully my digestive system eventually thanks me for the rest. Right now I feel like my stomach hates me!

Yesterday was my first day and it was brutal.
I have a pretty fast metabolism, so I normally eat constantly.
The liquid mixture was pretty filling, but I miss the experience and flavors of FOOD.

On top of the food yearning... I was watching VH1 to try to distract myself and the show was about celebrity diets and weight loss and gain. THEN they happened to begin to talk about a few celebrities who have done this fast and they made fun of it. So I felt like I was being tested in a way.  The commentators were lame though. They didn't get the fact that the fast is about cleansing the body of toxins.  

My tongue is already feeling weird.

Oh, and I went to the grocery store yesterday which was also torture.
Day two...

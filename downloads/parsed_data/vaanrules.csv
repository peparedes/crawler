"event","We are not shaped by our color,
By our race,
By our sex, or sexual preference,
we are not shaped by our parents,
we are not shaped by money,
by how many siblings we have,
we are not shaped by our job,
by how much schooling we have,
or anything else the world tells us that shapes us.

some of them our byproducts of what shapes us.

But yet I want to give everyone hope,
We are shaped by our choices, and our challenges that we take on.
Not all our easy, not all our hard,
We are not perfect, but by our choices we can be as close as we can reach at any one time.

But do not give up hope for because our next choice could be the best one we ever made.

Dedicated to my Kat who I will always love and that is my choice."

If you have any ideas let us know as long as we can see the menu to make them at home of course.  If questions ask Kat."

Then she tried to trick me by twisting it back on the wrong way.

She twisted it back on the right way and put it upside down (I was afraid water would get in my nose).

She then put it back on but now I have a cold. Achooo!!!

She then grabbed it and twisted back and forth making it perfect or so I thought.

To end the torture she sucked on my nose with lot of sucking and tongue and I was intrigued.

That is my random entry for the day."

"event","HELL EXPLAINED BY A CHEMISTRY STUDENT

Body:

Body: The following is an actual question given on a University of
Washington chemistry mid-term. 

The answer by one student was so ""profound"" that the professor shared it
with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the
pleasure of enjoying it as well :

Bonus Question: 
Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas
cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need
to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which
they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to
Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many
souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in
the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member
of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of
these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we
can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they
are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.
Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law
states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the
same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. 

This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter
Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell
breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell,
then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year
that, ""It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into
account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be
true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen
over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it
follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct;
leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which
explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ""Oh my God.""

THIS STUDENT RECEIVED THE ONLY ""A"".

Kat is so pretty when she sleeps."

SO yeah me.  I know Kat will commemt saying no I won't but it will happen along with me naming a pug, Frog.  I have no clue how she puts up with me?  That will be a poll for next time.

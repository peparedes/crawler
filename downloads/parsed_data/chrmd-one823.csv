"event","Okay today I talked to Mr. Sample, to get the real reasons, why I didn't get captain. Yes, I'm still on this I didn't get captain thing. So if don't wanna read it, then you don't have to. 
Anyway. The answer to my question, this is what he told me: That you can be a tad bossy and negative, you got some terms wrong when you were teaching commands, and your marching still needs work(there's a surprise*rolls eyes*) Okay, I'm jokingly bossy, and I also thought that I offset my negatives with a positive. 
But on the flip side of it he said that I'm a good Clarinet player, I'm well liked by other people in the band and you're a great member of the band. The only way I'm getting captain now is if more woodwinds come in then he origianlly thought.
Now I need to go and finish the reply for the letter that Krystal gave me, she's upset with this too. She said that I deserved it over her and she thinks that I may be mad at her. I love my 'Stand Band Buddy'!"

"event","Today was a horrible day. I feel like crawling into a hole and not coming out for a few days. Why do I feel like this? I'll tell ya why: Today was the day that Sample posted the captains list. And guess what? I didn't get it. This would be the reason why I feel like crap. This is my 2nd time trying out for captain, and yet again I didn't get it. And he gave me the most bullshit reasons that I've heard to why I didn't get it. He told me, basically this: It wasn't just you, this applies to alot of people. BUt you need more practice on your marching, calling commands and teaching. All that went through my head was 'What the fuck?!' So I didn't get it why? I mean if alot had the same problem that I did, then why did they get captain? I think for some reason he doesn't like me, that's the only that I can think of. I mean, I busted my ass all last week to get. And everyone that I've talked to said that I deserved it. I cried 5 times today because of this, and it's just not fair.*tears in eyes during the whole time*
The only good thing that came out of today was that I passed my Chem quiz. 89! Yea!*feels slightly better*

I'm finally passing Chemistry, ok it's a 70, but hey I'm passing. And with this project I have to do for that class, it's worth 2 test grades!!! Yay, that'll pull my grade up.*hopeful* I thik my parents have found a car for me to have, it's a '96 Grand Am and it's white. It's alright. So that means I'm one step closer to getting my license(sp?)
Not really too much more is going on with me right now. Trying to see if a friend of mine is can come up here for Spring Break or if I can go down to Jacksonville for a couple of days. That is if the friend in question would respond to my e-mails.

Me and Kassie hung out for the day, Alexix would've been able to hang out with us too, but she had to go somewhere with her youth group. My mom had to go to the school that day so me and Kassie went and saw the guard. Katie, gurl I love you but you killed my eardrum. Apparently my mom told the guard that my birthday was that day so they sang happy birthday to me, like last year. :) I love you guys. And Izzy, still no greys here. ~LOL~ I got my class ring and I love it. It's pretty. Exactly like I wanted it. 
On to a different note of conversation. Chemistry sucks. I'm failing, 2 points from passing, but still. Gosh this sucks. I DO NOT want a repeat of last semester like I had with Alg 2. I've never failed classes before, so it's really, REALLY hard for me. If I don't pass, idk what I'll do. 
And I have to prepare for Tri-County. Yes, I'm actually going this year. Shocking isn't it? But I'm scared cuz I've heard that they give you the hardest music to sight read. And I'm not the best sight reader in the world. Wow this is a long entry. Don't think I've written one this long in a long time. And now I'm running out of things to say.

Pretty much the same ole same ole has been going on. Trying to pass Mr. Wiers class, and that's not going to well at all. I'm in serious danger of not passing his class. And I've never failed a class before. So naturally I feel really bad. So I need to pass these next two tests and the last quiz and do super on the EOC. Say a few hundred prayers for me. Aside from that things are going okay. 
Band class was fun yesterday. There were boxes and styrafoam all over the floor. And we were like kids with ADHD when we saw them. People hitting people with the foam and kicking people when they were in the boxes. The only reason why it got taken away was because I guess Mr. Sample thought that we were getting a tad carried away. Well after that. Things calmed way down. I was actaully able to talk to Evan about something that was bugging me all year, and it went better then I thought it would. Then we got into the ever popular debate, who's better: Duke(yuck*sticks out tongue*) or Carolina(the best ever!) We even made a little bet on the games this year. Who ever wins that personh has bragging rights over the other.
After that, watched Billy Madison in the band room, played telephone and started a mini shoving match. Thanks to Hunter and KeShawn I was pushed into people like 4 different times. Oh well, it's all in good band fun. ~LOL~
Alexis stayed over last night and that was fun. She's crazy. She can even rival Kassie on some things. But we talked about different things, and some of what we talked about helped me in a way. Now I must reveal to Kassie, and only Kassie, Alexis's newest plan. And it's a good one. ~LOL~

Then we went and had desert at Ski's house cuz his parents and mine are pretty good friends. That was kool. I've never seen a fully grown Great Dane before, I didn't realize that they got that big. Then I came home and basically didn't do much of anything. 
Friday, got up and did some light cleaning around the house and then just chilled before I had to leave for consessions. I was not feeling very well, so I was way out of it. Didn't get home til around 11:45. We saw like 4 or 5 Deer in this one yard next to where the Skeakhouse is. There was just Does and I think a fawn, but I'm not a 100% sure about the fawn though.
Saturday, I finally saw Goblet of Fire!! OMG, it was the best movie I've ever seen. I cried at the end. But I laughed at the funny parts too, and there was a lot of those. I wanted to see it again. But I guess I'll have to wait unitl it comes out on DVD. And plus now I do believe that me and my brother finally resolved our issues. Which is wonderful. 
Today, I just have to look at the SAT booklet, cuz I'm taking the test this Saturday. I have to be at Jordan High School, at 7:45!! Ugh!

I realized this when we were going over it. Damn. From there the rest of the day was fine. 4th period I was in the library getting my ASVAB stuff back, I wish I had done better. I found out that my strong points are: Social(highest), Investigative and Artistic(tied for next highest). So that was good. Yea. ~LOL~ Now I'm at home trying to figure what to do cuz I already did my homework. Oh, yea, I remember*laughs at self* I have to study for a vocab test in HTR on Thursday. Med terms.

They to stop watching Jerry Sringer and South Park LOL I  wanted to hang him from a goal post and watch the ball hit him. Our porformance was really good. I was proud of us. I was mad that we couldn't stay on the field while our Seniors were being recognized.

Today was our last comp. And I wish that we had done better. We got 1st place Drumline, rating of exellent and 3rd place overall.

"event","All damn day since like the end of 1st period I've had the worst headache in the world. I mean like every loud noise made a big echo and made my headache that muck worse. I wanted to cry it hurt that bad. And I literally haven't had a headache this bad since the 3rd grade. UGH!!!!! I HATE IT!!  Not even passing a test in Mr. Wiers class made me feel better, and it's like the first one I've done well on all year long. Didn't play in band today, and I kinda wanted to too. We watched the video from Cary, and minus a few mistakes it was really good. We only have one more comp. left. And I want it to be the best one that it can be. 
Happy Halloween!!!!

Saw Byrd and Shannon and wanted to kil them, along with the rest of the band. But unlike Bryd and Shannon, we have class. So we just put our anger into our music and marching. And we did awsome!! Here are some pics from yesterday. </P>

Had practice from about 4-8, wasn't that bad. The whole show is on the field, but it's not perfect, but it's getting there though. We're going to Cary Band Day tomorrow! Wish us(band and guard people)the best of luck. I guess I'm in a good mood, just tired. But yeas I gotta and get ready to go bed, have to be at school by 8:30 tomorrow morning. Peace out people.

Ok, I guess I'm gonna update cuz I have some things on my mind that I need to get off. First, I find this new song fitting to what have I've been feeling the past couple of days, I'm not saying why though. But even after talking Alexis, Kassie and Evan, a small part of me feels the same, but just a tiny bit. But thank you guys sooooooooo much for helping me the past couple of days. Each of you helped in your own way, and that's what helped me feel better I love you guys!

Second. I'm getting so fucking tired of all of the bullshit that's goin on in band right now! I'm tired of some of the brass getting on my case, and Haley's, for stuff that's not our fault to begin with. IT'S NOT MY FAULT!!!!! Gosh, get it through your heads. I know that I have my mess ups, but so do you! 

Aside from that, I'm doing ok I guess. I gotta go and finish my poster for Health Team Relations on Verterinary Medicine. Leave them please.

Didn't get home from that unitl about 12:30 Saturday morning. Had to be at the school by 8 for band practice. We left the school about 10:30 and got to Lumberton High School about 1:30-2:00(I think) We performed at 4:30 and awards were at 6:00. Awards: rating of Excellent, 4th place overall(out of 8 bands)and 1st place percussion, and guard got 3rd place overall. Not bad for our first one. Bring on the next one! ~LOL~ The bus ride back was fun cuz me, Alexis, Haley, Hunter, Brittnay J., and Brandon played 'Truth or Dare', and something else but I can't remember what though. I didn' get any sleep cuz the brass and some woodwinds were singing the whole way home. Got home at like 11:45 and was asleep by 12:30 and I woke up at noon today. I was tired. I was shocked to see a band from Onslow County Schools there. It wasn't White Oak, but Northside. It was weird seeing a band from my hometown there. But they're awsome they were Grand Champions that day. I didn't get to see them perform, but they have a great sound. I was telling Alexis that if White Oak was there, I would've been torn in 2, cuz I would've marched with them, and we're BOTH Vikings. It was weird. But WO is 4A and we're 2A(depressing).

So I don't know whether to thank the person that found and turned it in, or be mad at them for making a couple calls on MY phone! I'm starting to wonder if the only reason that it was turned in at all was because my dad had it disactivated last night. But I learned my lesson about where to and where not to put it.
Anywayz, today was a good day. Took the PSAT, again, I don't like taking it. Kassie thank you for the note, it did make me feel a whole lot better. Well I guess I'm gonna go and study for my midterms/watch Charmed. Peace out people.

So hopefully we'll be as ready as we can be for our first competition next week. *crosses fingers and prays*. I have a funny feeling that my Algebra class is in for a lecture next class, or whenever Mr. Wier gets back. I mean, I didn't anything except help Sam with her work and laugh, but that was it. Any other sub wouldn't have cared about us talking, but ours was different. He had a student go and get Mrs. Brooks(who was off campus, thank God) to talk us. But anwayz, I'm kinda running outt a things to say. I have to work on my Spanish and Health/Team Relations hw, and then sit and ponder my latest deliemma.

Second: took a quiz in Spanish, hopefully I passed. Algebra learned some really simple stuff. Fourth, Krystal decided to gross me out by talking about a movie that she had watched in one of her classes. Thanks Krystal for the really desturbing images in my head. Made sick, not literally, metaphorically speaking. Well, it's offical the Clarinet section is plum nutty. You would've had to be there today to understand why. But I love my section though. Go Clarinets.. Well lets see I aleady finished my Alg. cuz like I said it's super easy. And I finished my workbook pages for Spanish. Now I'm going to start my notecards. Gonna try and get the bulk of them done tonight so that I won't have to rush before and after practice. 

Practice last night would've been better, but of course more and more drama pops up everywhere. Mostly in the hornline. I wish that it would go away. We attempted to do a run through of the opener (drill and music) for the first time, and it was close to a train wreck. But it was our first time though, so I guess with that in mind it was alright.

"event","Today was a long ass day. The good thing is that we have all the drill on the field for the opener, go us! Just drill though. I was so mad because Haley wasn't there today. She's my effin dress point. So I was constantly wrong and it wasn't even my fault. OMG made me so mad. But I'm jsut glad that we got that over it. I'm feelingbad for the guard cuz they're behind, but it's not their fault. This is a shout out to all of my guard girlies: Just keep going and do the best that I know you can do. I love you guys bunches!!!
Well my and shoulders are burned so bad, so I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow. Not sure what else to say. So later ppl

"event","FINALLY IT'S THE WEEKEND!! But to bad I only have like a day of it though. Oh, well I'll get over it, I alwayz do. Well I still feel like crap, my thoat is killing me. It's getting to where I can't play my Clarinet, and that sucks. I really, really, hope that I'm not getting sick sick. 

Practice last night was OK, I mean if people would cut the crap then it would be like a thousand times better. That's why we take so long somtimes is cuz people are alwayz arguing with other people! I dont' remember it every being like this. Well anywayz, Evan and Robert's dad brought me home. It took me 10 minutes to convince them that I didn't want anything from Bojangles. I found it very amusing. I told Evan that I've never met 3 people as persistant as them ~LOL~. And Kassie, I'm NOT a freaking idiot, lol. Love ya gurlie. I came home and started my homework, but I didn't finish it cuz I got tired so I went to bed. 

Well I'm not really sure what else to write. So I'm gonna go.

I've fallen in love with this song. It's even on my xanga. 


she'd do anything to sparkle in his eye
she would suffer, she would fight, and compromise
she's been wishin' on the stars that shine so bright
for answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

she must rinse this all away
she can't hold him this way
she must rinse this all away
she can't love him this way

how she'd be soothed, how she'd be saved if he could see
she needs to be held in his arms to be free
but everything happens for reasons that she will never understand
'til she knows that the heart of a woman will never be found in the
arms of a man

chorus

and if she runs away she fears she won't be followed
what could be worse that leaving something behind
and as the depth of oceans slowly become shallow
it's loneliness she finds ...
if only he was mine

she'd do anything to sparkle in his eye
she would suffer, she would fight, and compromise
she's been wishin' on the stars that shine so bright
for answers to questions that will haunt her tonight

she must rinse him
she must rinse him
she can't rinse him
she can't rinse him
she can't, she won't, she must rinse him
she can't, she won't, she must rinse him
she must rinse him
she can't rinse him
she must rinse him
she can't rinse him"

"event","The past two days have been pretty good, minus the fact that my throat has been sore the past two days. I hope that I'm not getting strept throat, that would suck, cuz I haven't had it since like 6th grade. *Knocks on wood*. Anywayz, practice went ok last night. If we could move just a tiny bit faster, then I think that we can be even more ready for our first comp. But that's just me ~LOL~. Let's see what else? Oh, yea I hasd to finish my Alg. test yesterday and I answered all but like 3 problems, so if I get all of the other questons right, then I'll make an 85, *crosses fingers*. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to get my class ring made. Brittany Daniels thinks that I should see if  I can get a Clarinet on one side and flags on the other. My two favorite things. But that'll have to be a custom job cuz the Clarinet and flags, are only suppossed to go under the stone. See the problem? I do know that I want a rose to go under my stone, that's gonna be soo pretty. Well anywayz, I think I'm done for now. I have to finish my Alg and Spanish, I also gotta start my notecards for Spanish(that's the easiest thing for me to do ~LOL~)

Leave one, or two or heck even three.

"event","Why does everything seem like such a confusing mess right now?
Especially with you?
Some people think that we should be together, and others don't. 
I know that your with someone,
But that doesn't stop me and some of my friends from wondering and saying these things.
Day after day I think about this,
And day after day I pray for an answer, but have yet to recieve one. 
So I'm stuck in a big confusing space, with no answers. 
And it only makes things harder for me.
I feel that the only person with the answers, is you. 
Could you please in some way, shape or form send them to me?
I want, no need, the answers that I so long for.
I need the confusion to be gone."

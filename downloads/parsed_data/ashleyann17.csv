"event","wow, so much has happened. i dont even know where to start. im still working like a fiend. at first it was hard to be working so much and away from everything. but now, now im numb to it all. im not at ict or dash anymore. which, mind you, is completely my own decision, i feel as though i dont need to allow my life to be revolved around god at this point. i need to explore everything before i can just decide like that. hmm. i dont know. its nuts. ive basically just been working. after work i usually hang out with matt and everyone. it seems crazy how the kid who i thought was crazy because he asked me out every weekend at minerva, would be my boyfriend. haha, its nuts. its even crazier to think that we've been together for a month already. thats really all ive been doing, but having an awesome time while doing it. this whole college thing is becoming impossible to me. where to go? what to do with my life? getting out completely? or being close to home? there are far too many damn questions for me to answer. i just dont understand. i have it narrowed down to two. i think.... maybe not. i guess ill see. contrary to recent decisions, malone is still a very prominent option. maybe when im there, ill be able to better decide what the hell to follow. if not malone, than kent. and let me tell ya, kent is looking pretty good right now. not too far, not too close. a bigger school. the majors i desire. tons of people i know going there. which isnt necessarily a good thing. but, as for now i must go. im going shopping before work. working on life... ::sigh:: all the changes..."

"event","all right. so i just read alis journal, about how she doesnt think shes ready for a big change and whatnot. first of all, i just wanna say that i think shes more ready than she thinks. but, nonetheless, ive been thinking. yeh, i know, this again. when i think, something comes over me and i just write. not necessarily sure of what i mean by anything. all i know is that ive been pushing anything high school related away from me. much like ali said, i havent been myself lately. which is perhaps why all of our conversations seem empty. im at fault, i know, i just dont know how to fix it. i know im ready for a change. i get too antsy when things become ""the usual."" i hate that. someone asks, ""whats goin on?"" and my variation of answers is, ""nothin really"" or ""the usual."" it drives me insane. work is coming along. its to the point where im used to it now and dont necessarily mind it. as for college, im ready. graduation is a mere seven months away. which, in my opinion, seven months too far. dont get me wrong, im going to miss everyone. im going to miss my mom and my life here. but im much more excited to share my new life with everyone when i come back. to grow up. my independent spirit has been screaming for nearly eighteen years, and its finally going to be exposed. the only thing is that im wondering who ill become. if i will change. if ill be myself. i guess we'll find out."

"event","hm. so plans of updating the other day were crushed. but hey, youll have that. life has been nuts lately. school is well, school. nothing difficult. just need to make sure i keep it that way and hold focus. last chance to bring up my gpa, which has been slowly drowning in a whirlpool of apathy since freshman year. finally, i found the drain plug. the thing is, i need to refind that plug for my spiritual life. its not terrible. but for some time it was nearly nonexistant. recently, ive had a few kicks to get me back in the race. and this time, my stamina is going to be better than ever. i work a lot. thats had quite a bit to do with everything. its my choice to work, but im starting to notice the consequences. and webers is opening another store. ill be transferred there i believe. we'll see how the tips are at the new place. minervas. hmm. its not bad. dont hate it. dont love it. its just work. the usual. this weekend should be nice. friday i have to work. theres some kids goin over mikes that evening. i dont think ill go. i just dont feel the same there anymore. hmm. maybe when im working less ill feel better about it. im not sure what ill do. but ill do something indeed. i was talking about dash last night. i miss it more than ict. i think im going to take a sunday off sometime so i can go. wow. i just got a freaking hot flash. this is nuts. i really dont like this. ok, its beginning to subside. what was that?! craziness. anyway. so thats friday--undecided whats going on after work. ill talk to matt. maybe we'll do something. saturday will be exciting. i have a hair appointment at eleven-fifteen. im getting something done to my hair. im not sure what yet, but i am. then, time pending, im going shopping with ali. that evening, the ict guys' are putting on a dinner for the chicks. its sweet. love those kids. i believe thats all for that evening. maybe other things going on. we'll see. sunday. church. maybe float building if theres time before i go to work at four. minerva. i hope its not busy. ill cry. i need the money, but i cant handle that much stress. ::sigh:: i need to sleep, or at least breathe. homecoming is coming up really quickly. im excited. im going with matt. :). hes awesome. i used to deny him like crazy and now i spend hours talking to him. last night we talked about how awesome God is for two hours. its awesome to see how hes so passionate about God. his sister is a freshman at my school. her name is katie. i love her so much. shes seriously the sweetest girl ever. she writes me notes and everything and gives me a hug everytime she sees me. shes even glad matts going to homecoming. its awesome how close they are. im going to invite her to ict sometime. shes cute. but yeh. i have to get ready for work. ::sigh:: ill write more...eventually. love yall. buh bye!"

"event","i really dont have anything to say, considering its seven-something in the morning and i have anything eventful happen yet. i left school early yesterday. i was dead tired. i came home around twelve and slept until four, when i had to get up for work. went to work. that was a freakin party-oh wait. it sucked. surprisingly slow for such a nice day. matt came to visit me for ten and a half million years. i have a lot of venting to do, but not enough time to do so. so ill try to write later on, but no promises. my throat hurts. im not a fan in the slightest. im really not thirsty, but i was told to drink something for my throat. i guess ill go ahead and do that. i work today. again, not fun. its claires birthday. yay! happy birthday claire! wow, eighteen. thats nuts. im sure ill look into that more philosophically later, but again, lack of time. hm. i guess ill go to school now. and get something to drink. have a good day everyone."

"event","i havent updated seriously in quite some time now. ive been busy. and apathetic. which i dont think is necessarily a bad concept. so, i guess ill try to say something of substance.
  so about that car accident. we're ok now. i guess im just stressed out about the whole thing. my not used to being hindered in anything i do. hmm...thats all. 
  i feel like all the people that were involved are mad at me for some reason. and even when i ask them and they say no, i know something is up. worries me. i feel like im already losing touch with everyone i was so close to but weeks ago. i know its me too. ive changed. i dont know how, but i feel it. its odd. theres nothing i can do about it though. and im not sure how that makes me feel. but yes. but i am indeed a different person. maybe not completely, but in some respect. deeper, more aware of my thoughts and feelings and more apathetic about the thoughts of others. independence. yet still a child. im starting to realize that im not the way ive been oh-so nicely labeled as through high school. im discovering myself. and its awesome. i dont need to tell anyone. thats part of who i am. more self-restrained as far as confiding is concerned. i dont want to confide anymore. nothing comes of it. i shouldnt say that. not all the time. sometimes its great. other times i walk away feeling as a burden and empty. im overflowing with emotions, but vacant. its insane.
  lets see. ive been working a lot. i wasnt allowed to go into work on monday. my mom didnt want me to. i didnt mind it though. it was nice to have a night off. i worked tuesday at webers. i worked wednesday at webers. i worked thursday at webers. i worked tonight at webers. i work tomorrow. i work on sunday. i suppose im a bit stressed. however, working has become a satisfying escape. webers is opening a new location in north olmsted. itll be open all year. im transferring there. itll be nicer, cleaner and hopefully ill make more money. i wont be at ict until novemberish. dash, who knows. i dont like minerva. its not fun. the environment is ridiculously intimidating. i dont know. jamie just started there. thats cool. we dont talk much. love her though. ali still works there. i dont think she likes me very much. i did something, just undecided as of yet. hmm. thats all with that subject i think.
  i ""need to have a talk with someone."" or so i was told. im not sure what, but thats usually not a very good thing. went to mikes after work tonight. the one who needed to talk to me wasnt there. guys sleepover thing, felt ridicously unwelcomed at mikes for the first time. not a fan. hmm. i dont know when ill have time to talk. soon i presume. hm, pensive.
  sitting at my comp right now. ridiculously tired. waiting for my cell to ring. i wonder if it will. i have a feeling it wont. i hope so...you are so crazy go nuts cute when you laugh. haha. wow, life can bring one intriguing people. its awesome. enough about that now.
  i really dont know what else to say. i love you all. i just dont have the time and, at the moment, am not equipped for such an act. but yeh. ill talk to you all soon, im sure.
  keep it real in the lbc. thats what zach always says. i love zach. hm, ok...im done now. 
  later kids."

Gods sweet. hmm...i guess thats all for now. its 1:02 am. i should go to bed. ali, if you read this: ::coming at me with a knife:: gus: buh bye...::stabs me:: haha. maybe thats why i cant sleep. and tony: come out come out wherever you are... eww! haha ok. night everyone! love you all...thank God we're all ok. ::sigh:: life is gonna be so awesome again. i can feel it. and you better come visit me at minerva tomorrow night. not that youll read this. haha. night! <3 y'all!"

"event","apparently lately ive been 'striving for attention.' i need to 'quit the small talk.' i dont know who said it, nor does it matter. but, nonetheless im not going to try to get attention over it. ive been distant lately, indeed. with no fault to others. i dont even see it as a bad thing. honestly, sometimes i just think its good to retreat from other people. if i were old enough, take a vacation. think. im a busy kid, no doubt. two jobs and whatnot. but i have no place to complain about them. it was my choice to take on a second job. its for a mere two months, but apparently im also avoiding my youth group. i dont know what to say in order to cut out the small talk. i dont know who you are, but i certainly apologize. here, an actual thought of mine: i just feel as though every sense of belonging has been stripped away from me. too young for college, too old for high school. friends...love them to death. i just feel unwanted. who knows, maybe this is anoher plea for attention. but regardless, im giving this person what they wanted--no small talk. would you like me to pour out my entire life in an online journal? i really dont know what to say anymore. i just feel like no matter what i say is going to backfire. like everything else. if i talk about it--im pleading for attention. if i dont talk about it--im being distant with mere small talk. i dont know how to deal with it. i think thats why i took the other jobs, i dont have to deal with anything. its past two am. country jam tomorrow. i should get rest.

"event","ok...im back from shopping and whatnot. john and i went to dennys for breakfast. i couldnt eat...i already felt sick to my stomach. then we headed over to guitar center...for two hours. we actually had a lot of fun. we went in the acoustic guitar room and he played. it was amazing. we sat there for like an hour just singing and playing. it was awesome. he bought a keyboard, mic and cord thingys. ha. after we were done, we went to wal*mart. he had to buy a printer and a mattress pad. mind you, mattress pads are not that easy to find apparently. haha. joked around a lot. then it came time for us to part. i never imagined it would be so hard. we sat in his car listening to music and not saying a word. finally, we turned the music off and sat in utter silence. he reached in the back seat and handed me a teddy bear that hes had since he was a kid. then i gave him the letter i wrote him and made him promise not to read it until he was gone. i sat there...crying. then we prayed together. that we keep God as our center so we could get through this. and we know that with God, we can. after all the hesitations and long goodbyes. we finally said goodbye for the last time. then i lost it and practically ran to my door. looking back only once-for just one more glance. we're going to be fine. i know we are. the latest i would see him is three months. around thanksgiving. but, Gods awesome. so we'll be fine. nine hours isnt that far... ok thats a lie, but still. he'll be in nashville... but i have awesome friends who are here for me. makes me smile. :). ali especially knows what im goin through. i love her. i love all of them. the end. i cant do this anymore. buh bye."

"event","i havent written in a bit. and i dont have much time to do so. lets review:
ive been doin the usual really. hangin out with the bratpack, workin, ict, getting closer to God. not in that order of importance, of course. i got my senior schedule. again with the whole reality of being a senior thing. its so weird. ali and i used to talk about how when we got mail from the school, it would say, ""attention: senior parents!!"" and we would throw it away. same letters came this year...we kept them. its so weird knowing that one year from now, ill be getting ready to leave for school. im excited and terrified. but, wherever God wants me to go--im there. i just need to learn to listen to Him more. 
ict was last night. it was all right. girls' group, as always, a bit unfocused, but other than that, it went well. it was about Gods character. Hes so incredible. and sometimes, i think i take that for granted. the full group was about what makes God smile. it was really awesome to hear that i could make Him smile. :) wow. mike wasnt there...still on vacation on florida, so there was no guitar player. sara played a couple of songs and did awesome. then we sang a capella. claire brought a cd that we sang along with too. while it seemed really simple, it just got me thinking of how awesome those kids are, and how nothing could stop them from praising our God. :) i love it. erin was at ict. that made me happy. i still need to talk with her about some things. i want us to be able to be real with each other again. i love her, shes awesome. and when she really gets back into God, and God back into her--itll be amazing. 
ali and i have been really close lately. that makes me so happy. i love her so much. the accountability has helped a lot. i think im starting to realize that we have a lot more in common than i thought. shes such an awesome woman of God. shes one of those people i look up to when i want spiritual guidence. ::sigh:: i love her. :)
so that boy i was smitten about? yeh thats over. i was talking to an old friend, john. ive known him for quite some time now, but we've never really been super-close. we started talking a lot more since hes going away to college. and then it hit me. i prayed about it. and now i have to go, because im going shopping with him. hes leaving tomorrow...ill say more later."

What's there to say about you? You're an initiator of change and are keenly in tune to possibilities... you're enthusiastic, and it's contagious...you're tireless in the pursuit of newfound interests... You can anticipate the needs of others, and offer them needed help and appreciation. You bring zest, livelihood, and fun to all aspects of your life... 

You're agreeable, sociable, outgoing and like to imagine yourself in the future... who will you marry? what type of work will you do? where will you live? All questions you ask yourself...you like to keep your options open...you're imaginative...curious...you prefer to understand than judge.. 

You see endless possibilities. You hate to be boxed into anything -- like a career -- for life...so you hesitate and resist making decisions...always look for new and novel... 

You like a learning environment where the teacher takes a personal interest in you...You're motto might be: ""There's always a better way or a better answer..""... when you're committed to something, you are enthusiastic to the point of preaching to the whole world about it (...like the Storm Palace?) 

Your style of organization is... well, personalized. Others don't really see you as organized, though, do they? YOU know what's where, and there's a ""method to your madness,"" huh? 

You have a hard time separating work from leisure, since you have fun while you work. You're always on the lookout for new things... you like learning with others, so you'll invite 'em to join you at films, plays and classes. 

When you fall in love, you study the other person in every way. The one you fall in love with is ""the best ever"" a lot, huh? Sheesh. But others feel unconditionally loved by you ....you fall head over heels and get in love FAST. You are charming...full of vitality...you treat others with sympathy, gentleness, and warmth... 

Last part: watch out for losing your focus 'cause you wanna try too many ideas at the same time... you don't prioritize, so you can overload...also, because you're just a fun-loving animal, you might not complete important work and basic responsibilities...

"event","today was wonderful. for the most part.i dont sleep often, but last night was surprisingly refreshing. i woke up to the piercing sound of my cell phone at eleven-thirty. it was claire. ready and willing to hang out. myself, never denying an opprotunity to get out of my apartment, cordially accepted. she picked me up around twelve-thiry. we proceeded to pick up jordan and then alicia. we went to this waterfall. it was absolutely gorgeous. we just sat there and talked for a while. it was really fun. to just see how awesome Gods creation is. ah, love it. well, after we got bored there (haha) we wanted wendys. so we scrounged up quarters and went to wendys to buy $.99 frostys. mmm. we stayed there for a bit and then decided to go visit angela. (jordans gf) love her. well, her phone was busy and she has cable internet. her mom was at work, so we figured she must be home. so we went to her house and knocked obnoxiously on the doors and windows and i rang the doorbell like 25 times. the dog was going nuts, but no angela. so, we realized that the one door was unlocked. so what do we do? we go inside. ha. but, there were two doors and the second was locked. then, we realized that we were breaking an entering and her neighbors across the street saw us looking in her windows. haha. turns out, she was in the shower and the phone was left off the hook. anyway. we decided to go to the park. it was fun. we swung on the swings. felt like a kid again. it was great. just talked and laughed and had fun. without having to spend any money (food wasnt a necessity) we had an awesome time. well, claire and ali had to work so we all went back home. i just relaxed for a bit and hung out. i had a bible study tonight, so i waited for jim to pick me up around 7:50. when we got to the study, no one was there. so me, jim, jeff and tony had a study. it was awesome. God speaks through jim so awesomely. then, when it was over, aaron and keith showed up late. they were held back...something about drunk people and golf. but, it was good seeing them. :) we hung out for a while and talked. it was a good day in general. made me really happy.
now, back to the usual subject. i need to vent. this boy that i happen to be smitten toward is turning out to be even better than i thought. but, i truly feel as though the feelings are not mutual. then lately, ive been thinking to myself. about this other guy. i know, im making things difficult. im an idiot. and i never thought id ever feel like this toward him of all people. and maybe its just cause we're such good friends. i dont know. but again, i feel as though the mutal portion isnt there. i dont know. i just have to pray about it and see what God wants. maybe i should just talk to them. i dont know. someone give me comments, please. im just sick of crappy relationships. *sigh* i dont know.
ok, now for the weekend plans. tomorrow i have a meeting in the morning for vacation bible school that im helping out with next week. then im supposed to go out to lunch with ali. after that, im not really sure whats goin on. but i dont know how long ill have to hang out. tomorrow night im supposed to get together with this guy patrick. hes an amazing musician who works totally for God. he performed for us and was looking for people who play instruments. so i told him i was interested. we're supposed to jam with my cello. but i dont know whats going on. theres also a skabots show tomorrow night that i would love to attend. but, i dont know if ill have a ride. haha anyway. right now im talking to aaron. hes funny. he makes me smile. :) haha. hes the only person im talking to. kinda sad. i talked to dave earlier. hes in the skabots. we were debating who was a bigger nerd. i won. which is why my mood is nerdy. otherwise id be confused. ah, so many boys. actually just the two, but i dont know what to do. i guess if it were more obvious itd be easier. but its not. *sigh* again, please leave advice. haha. well, i think im going to go to bed. meeting tomorrow. gah. night everyone, love you much."

"event","heather and cody left this morning. they stopped by my place before they did. my sister let me know they were here. i walked out of my room and heather immediately clung to me and cried. it was so hard on her. i never thought i could have a high impact on anyone like that. she just kept telling me how much she loved me and was going to miss me. we sat in utter silence. no tears were shed on my part. heather cried enough for all of us. we'll see her soon. i love her so much. then cody came up to me. he hugged me so tighyly and buried his head in my shoulder, crying. told me how awesome its been to meet me and to take care of ali for him. which i will everyday. its amazing to me how many tears were shed for the people here. but then i think again and i realize that theyre crying for my friends. and i dont blame them one bit. all of the people they met are amazing in their own way. id do the same. theyre home now. and i dont really know what to do with myself. ive been with them everyday for the past two weeks. theyve become a brother and sister to me and i cant wait to see them again. alicias pretending shes ok. and while i think shes doing better than we all assume, i dont think its really kicked in for her yet. its going to be hard, but i know she can do it. now, on to different things. i called off work tonight. alicia, angel the girl is, went in for me. im not feeling well, actually quite nauseated. its not a fun feeling. but, theres a reason for everything. maybe i was going to get hit by a car or something on the way there. who knows. whatever it was, i thank God im protected. im going to a concert tomorrow. this makes me smile. im seeing thousand foot krutch at the odeon with a friend of mine. nice kid. itll be a good time. i know i should take advantage of this time at home and read my summer books for school. but, im lethargic. again with the talk of school. seems so far away, but really...its a matter of weeks. i just thought to myself and realized that this is, indeed, my last summer as a child. ill be eighteen in a matter of months. an adult. i should probably grow up, but i think ive done quite enough of that for a while. wow. senior year again. my last football games. last homecoming. last renaissance assembly, though i cant say im upset over that one. last high-school birthday. last winter break. last high-school new year's party. last winter formal. last spring break. last luau. last time losing red day. last high-school relationships. last high-school hearbreak. last year of childhood. ict. dash. the underclassmen whove become my little brothers and sisters. the times of praise i give our God with them. ive realized this journal is very sad. but...think of it this way. first summer as an adult. no more drama at high-school football games. no more drunk teenagers at dances. no more dances with nothing but vulgur, rap music. no more assemblys, period. i think ive taken the breaks for granted. we're all on break at the same time and we all count on seeing each other. but after this year, ill realize that ill be able to see the kids im leaving behind. see theyre progress, visit old teachers. walk through the halls of my old, high school and find my old lockers. feel, one more time, as though i have my whole life ahead of me. walk through the halls, let people look at me and not wonder to myself what theyre thinking. know who i am and that i made it through. ali has a quote that i see on her away message every once in a while. it says, ""why do we keep looking at the past? because at least we knew we made it."" and thats so true, even now, before school has even started. i know that in ten months, ten months that will seem like five minutes of life-changing events, ill hear the echo of my own heels across an auditorium floor as they call my name. that the tassle switching sides will become tangible. that im going to make it."

"event","while this evening was, indeed, refreshing...i am uncomfortable. but thats only because im sitting oddly and my foot went numb about fifteen minutes ago. tonight was awesome. claire and i went to the park and swung on the swings while talking about vh1's i love the 90's. its a great show. then we walked aimlessly in the mall to waste time. went to target...again to waste time. then finally, we called alicia to get her from work. while we were waiting, we went to wendys and bought frostys...using quarters. they gave us a bag...and two packets of honey-roasted pecans. but thats not important. we picked up ali from work then headed back to my place. got bored quickly. we decided to rent a movie and get food. so we rented starsky & hutch. then we went to tops and bought break & bake cookie dough and stuff for s'mores. and, of course...cream soda. we went over to mikes house because no one was there and watched the movie on his projector screen. we hung out there with louie (who i love!) just the four of us, until mike, cody and heather got back. they had been at greek fest all day. cody and heather are leaving for home (illinois) monday morning at seven am. i tried to spend time with them tonight. i have to work tomorrow night and i dont know how much ill be able to see them. its sad. but theyve been such a blessing and i know ill see them soon! so we hung out and let ali and cody have some ""alone time."" so we hung out with heather and louie went home. it was an a really good night. very simple. just hanging out and talking. no worry if you werent acting ""cool"" the boy im smitten over wasnt even there. we took ali home around one-ish and then claire and i got back to my place soon after. claire is currently sleeping on my floor with a native indian blanket and my sisters on the couch as usual. i, unable to sleep, am here writing nothing of relevence. yet enjoying it. it was a night ill never forget with something as simple as a movie and hanging out. irrelevent, yet memorable. made me happy. i can feel my foot now...that makes me happy too."

"event","im not sure why im writing this. im not bored. just, well, pensive i suppose. so much has become apparent to me lately. and im not really sure what to do with my thoughts. so this is where they go. cause no one really wants to listen. if they care, theyll read it. if they dont, theyll stop. and ill never know the difference. but regardless. a lot on mind mind lately. starting to realize that theres one month of summer left. my last real summer before i go to college. im a senior. last year. and im finally out. im getting to the point where im in the middle. im afraid to grow up, but afraid to stay young. i visited my college. it was so much better than i ever thought. i fell in love in the parking lot. its malone college in canton. only about one half hour away from here. which i love. i couldnt imagine leaving my youth group for very long. i love those kids and im hoping they feel the same. high school. what exactly does it mean? its name doesnt remotely warn you for the fact that it ends so quickly. that you should prepare years in advance for your future. that youll have heartbreak. and best friends. and first loves. none of that. it merely involves the word 'school' which is immediately ignored. but regardless. ignore the rant.it doesnt matter anymore because as long as it took me to realize that...i mean really realize that-its almost over. one more year of youthful innocence until im hurled into the real world with many others who are just as lost. im scared. but anxious. im going to find myself and not be afraid. but as for high school. i have high expectations for the coming year. i know we'll always have our ups and downs (my friend and i, that is) but i think that at the same time, we'll realize that its almost over and begin to unite. in my youth group. there will be about eight of us leaving. its so surreal. i really cant wait though. im excited to become and adult. im just terrified to do it alone. im so glad my best friend is going to malone with me. i know that through our faith we can get through anything. shes been such an inspiration to me without ever knowing it. i love her to death. i definitely have the most amazing friends and i feel like crying everytime i think of leaving them. as for guys--im a single chick. whether im ok with it or not is a difficult question. ive been thinking constantly about my ex-boyfriend, but im not sure for what reason. i know we're not meant to be together, but i think about him still. ha. just sitting here thinking about it has made me realize that i miss companionship more than him. and im pretty sure that the fact that i could come to that conclusion so quickly, justifies that. dont get me wrong, i have my crushes just like everyone else. and at the moment i happen to be particularly smitten with a certain boy. but the fact that i dont know nearly enough about him to say anymore than i have is self-explanitory concerning the progress. im not even sure if id like to date before college. all right, thats a lie. i would love to date before college, im just not sure if it is in anyones best interest. i was at a Bible study recently and we discussed it remotely. we talked about how after high school theres an inevitable growing period. if youre with someone, you either grow faster than they do, dont grow at all, or grow in different directions. its inevitable in most cases. i dont deal well with heartbreak. i guess i just dont want to subject myself to an unnecessary pain source."

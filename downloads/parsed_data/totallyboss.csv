3.  generally awkward & socially inept.
4.  cursing plants and their existance.
5.  interning in the OR.

"event","My days have mostly been spent watching the food network, looking up recipes on foodnetwork.com, dreaming about food and cooking/baking food.  Recently, I have made my mom's chili, fried rice with stirfry vegetables, homemade whole wheat pasta (from scratch!), homemade cinnamon applesauce, and tonight, I made twenty-two whole wheat apple cinnamon muffins.  Man, they are tasty.  I definitely don't need to eat twenty-two, so I'm sharing.  

I was watching the food network (of course) and there was a show about weeklong cooking classes in Italy, Tuscany specifically, where you stay with a family and learn traditional tuscan meals.  It sounded really cool, but the price definitely did not ($2,500+).  I really want to go to take culinary classes, I think it would be a good thing.

I am for sure going on a sweets baking spree after Lent is over.  A few things I'm planning on making:  cherry/raspberry pie, tiramisu, homemade ice cream (+ homemade chocolate chip cookies, hot fudge, and whipped cream), and many other goodies, all courtesy of food network.

I'm going home in one week, and I couldn't be more excited.  If only I didn't have three finals to take next week.  I suppose it's time for bed.  Goodnight.

EDIT:  HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!  In honor of the occassion, I am making spinach tortolini with garlic chicken and for dessert, possibly crepes?  Those don't count as sweets, do they?  I don't think so, they're more like pancakes than dessert....mmmm, I can't wait till dinner."

Today, it's off to the gym, meeting matt for lunch (he's in davis! who comes to davis?!), and who knows what i'll be doing tonight.  but tomorrow, oh tomorrow.  tomorrow i'm going to san francisco with lauren to visit mi hermano.  i cannot wait.  and monday, NO SCHOOL.  this means i don't have my chem lab, which means i can watch 24.  oh my, sweet reunion with my love kiefer.

so i gave up sweets for lent, and let me tell you, it's been a challenge.  when i went home last weekend, my mom had bought me two bags of dove dark chocolate (the best!) and a bag of reese's peanut butter cups.  on valentine's day, rachel came over with homemade brownies and chocolate chip cookies.  not to mention, that last weekend was chocolate obsession weekend on the food network (the weekend i've been looking forward to for about a month).  what a test of sweet strength.

in other news, i wish i could be home again.  you know, it's only my home for so much longer, and i'm stuck up in cowtown instead of the place i dream of being, with my family."

despite having to sprint through the dallas-fort worth airport to make our connecting flight, inumerable falls off rocks into crashing waves, almost getting knocked off a 96-step-high mayan pyramid, nearly getting run over by buses driven by drivers worse than myself, eating some not so pleasant frijoles, getting dunked in the ocean while parasailing, and having a few rainy days, cancun christmas 2005 was a quite the trip.

we arrived in cancun at ten-ish, missing three pieces of luggage (like that has never happened before...), and immediately went to margaritaville for dinner and drinks.  the next six days were a mix of sun, rain, wind, good food, bad food, shopping, bartering, conquering pyramids, jumping off a ledge into a mayan well that was 150 feet deep, parasailing 300 feet into the air, laying out in the sun, dancing on chairs, and trying to translate spanish.

"event","I was walking across the quad yesterday, green grass and wet mud covering my shoes, when I heard a guitar.  To my right, a young lad was playing the strings of his acoustic guitar, filling the air with his music.  To my left, three people standing in a triangle.  Juggling.  Juggling those bowling pin shaped things.  All around me there was noise, people talking about their classes, dramatic sorority girls talking about their wild and crazy weekends, candidates passing out flyers left and right to get their peers to vote in the student elections...there was commotion everywhere.

         At this point, I realized that I am living in a circus.  But something was off.  If this place is circus, why aren't I having fun?  Circuses are meant to be fun.  Elephants, and lions, and people eating fire, and chickens with two heads, and side shows.  All of this seemed to be missing.  Instead, I am occupied by chemistry and biology and statistics.  Who cares what stereochemistry is, or which phylum sea anemones belong too, or how to find the 90% confidence interval of fictional data?  There are more important things in life than R-S configurations of organic molecules, or the life cycles of cnidarians, or standard deviations.  These things include family, and friends, and memories.

         This weekend gave me exactly what I needed.  Quality time spent with people who love me.  My brother, sister and I ventured to San Francisco, the biggest circus west of the Mississippi, and definitely more entertaining than the Davis circus.  Despite getting off the Bart at the wrong stop, falling on the stairs in the bus, and getting a parking ticket, the trip was one of the best times I've had this year.  There's nothing like walking along Market and Powell and seeing an old man with a poster babble on about how ""sex should be saved for marriage!  No sloppy seconds!  Anyone who has sex before marriage is a whore!""  And then walking into Nordstrom's and seeing drag queens get their make-up done at the mac counter.  And then standing on the edge of the trademark Powell trolley, holding on to the pole for your life while flying down the steep hills of the city.  Or the trolley operator nearly hitting a car in an intersection.  Although, nothing beats, or even comes close to beating, splitting a ghiradelli brownie sundae with your sister at Ghiradelli Square.

         Unfortunately, I'm back to the Davis circus, filled with cows and midterms and events not even remotely close to the good times in the city.  But, as long as I'm here, I know there will always be an open seat for me to watch the circus in good ole San Fran.  After all, it's only an hour away.  Longer by bicycle, of course."

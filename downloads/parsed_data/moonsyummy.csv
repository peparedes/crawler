"event","For me, the purpose of the DA is to present the other side, to make sure I'm not just blindly pursuing an opinion. And usually meeting the DA face to face results in a neutralization of both sides, after which I get to return to my usual carefree self. Acid, meet base. That's about the highest extent of my Chemistry knowledge.
Most things are small enough that they just become absorbed. It's not that my skin is thick, it's just that it's adaptable. I'm the finch in the Galapagos Islands. I tell myself I'm resilient like a sponge. Which is one too many things in common with the ever-annoying Spongebob Squarepants, seeing as we are both yellow. 
Other things call for the DA to step in, and my initial reaction is tamed. Reason sets in. As perhaps I may be a rabbit, the power to forgive and forget makes an appearance. But this strange power is misnamed. The only way things are forgotten is if they didn't happen, or if you had a happy childhood. Things are repressed. Things are reevaluated to be tinted soft pink instead of glaring red. Things are agreed upon. Things are overcome as obstacles, to shrink further behind you. 
That doesn't change that if you looped back and tracked the remnants, you'd remember. It's just that it was in the past, and although the past certainly shapes the future, what ultimately determines what's to come is your own capable hands.
Make peace."

"event","I don't like pretending things are okay, when there's even a small possibility they aren't. I like to know.

I guess nothing truly changed from yesterday, but it feels like it has.

I may just be melodramatic. Maybe I should don a sparkly dress with lots of eyeliner and throw myself onto a stage.

Oh no, now self doubt, too?

If I was sure of anything I thought I used to be sure of myself.

Or maybe not. I can't even decide if that's bullshit right now.

Once I wake up tomorrow, this will be less of a big deal. And the day after, even lesser. But maybe that's just me trying to forget.

Everything is now open for questioning and newly sprung doubts.

What was ever what I really thought it was?

But it wasn't my decision to make, never was.

Honestly, I may bounce back and be able to say ""I don't care"" in a way that means I do, enough not to. Maybe.

Honestly, this could possibly be the buried reason for the pit our friendship will roll down into.

Really though, as I'm writing this I'm already hard at work halving my recovery time.

3 2 1 And I'm done."

"event","Seeing as the 2008 Summer Olympics located in Beijing are well underway, this entry seemed timely and fitting. Let's leave Michael Phelps' freakish superhuman fish-like swimmer skills to rest and switch to gymnastics. China was counting on fulfilling the country's pride on all gold in the sport. It has been well publicized that they probably even forged new ""competition passports"" for the women to pass as 16 years old. Now, I am barely surprised that this issue came up. Even though perhaps such a blatant disregard for the rules might seem stupid and futile to most, mainland China has never been subtle in its efforts in anything. Let's take the missing Taiwanese flag, for example. I even had a friend ask me curiously, if Taiwan <i>had</i> a flag. I was not in the least surprised that China disallowed it in the opening ceremonies. But ""Chinese Taipei?"" Come on, now. <br />Being asian is part of my life, but it doesn't in any way take over my life. I would say that I am neither white-washed nor fobby, but a balance between the two. There are certain lifestyle points that I agree to disagree on. Materialism, unnecessarily expensive things, respect for the elders, consciousness of being a guest, etc. In my opinion, there's no point in getting too caught up on the cultural differences. Getting pissed is a definite no-no. I have many friends that would get mortally offended should someone come up to them and ask if they were ""Korean? Japanese?"" when they were really Chinese. I like to give the public the benefit of the doubt. I'm too laid back to get my feathers ruffled every time something like that happened to me. <br />Fact: asians have flat noses that don't hold the bridge of a glasses frame for shit.<br />As a result, we can get hit in the face with much less devastating results. <br />Fact: the average asian is probably better at math than most. <br />But that doesn't stop the average math-gifted asian from resenting the expectation.<br />Fact: asians usually need glasses.<br />Some of us get contacts while some burrow themselves in the engineering quad never to see daylight again.<br />Fact: asians are usually cheap.<br />I warn you not to crack a joke about this or point it out unless you are very good friends with said asian. Stereotypes can often be proved true, but that doesn't mean they can be universally applied. It's an unfortunate Fact of Life.<br />Interesting Fact branching from the previous: I have known asian families who reuse PAPER towels over and over, by letting them dry in the sun. And I'm sure the whole a/c or heating issue, or lack thereof, is well known.<br />Fact: asian pride is fragile and flares up from time to time. <br />In the matter of the dinner check it becomes a matter of hospitality. The different families argue back and forth (a mandatory part of the process) over who pays the check. Eventually one family prevails. Actually, it was silently preordained who would pay the check, despite what the entire performance suggests.<br />I am Taiwanese. I acknowledge my roots from China. It remains indisputable that there are subtle differences between the Chinese and the Taiwanese lifestyles. I don't know if they will ever be recognized, compromised, or accepted."

"event","As we, representing the average Americans, seem to be void of enough drama in our shriveled pathetic love lives, we resort to gasping and crying over the valley girl version of a couple dozen white, blonde, rich rabbits stuck in a cage together - the cage being Orange County. Although it is probably true that, if all of us average Americans had 24 7 access to a brilliant sun, a beautiful beach, a huge bonfire, an even huger jacuzzi, and a couple Ranger Rovers, we wouldn't be able to resist humping a new prospect or planning the next sexual attack every minute of the day, either. 
And my mind drifted to Asia, and specifically Taiwan. There, even the couple-inch-wide-strapped tank top is rarely worn by the common folk, not to mention spaghetti straps or tube tops; the most riske form of PDA is considered to be holding hands. If they were to be exposed to the likes of LB, in all its orange-tanned glory? Heaven knows the horror. Sure, celebrities and the more advanced case of slutty girls are becoming more and more sexual, perhaps on level with the Americans, but that doesn't mean it's integrated into everyday culture. It'll be a few more decades, or never, before that happens. After all, asians are born naturally inable to express emotion and devoid of the gene the holds the knowledge of the french kiss. This is not surprising, seeing as the average asian is under four feet and has the penis of an Amerivan five year old. 
The Westernization in general, however, is hard to miss. Even the asian concept of beauty, although retaining the pasty white complexion, has gained the valuing of the double-lid. Asians everywhere are getting eye surgery to slit the side and make the eye bigger - thus making the iris slightly off center - or folding the lid to create a Western look - capable of holding many more shades of eyeshadow, oh my.
When will the inherent asian conservativeness fade? And at what point does the fading begin to erase the asian culture and heritage itself? Can progression retain tradition?

Right, back to Laguna Beach. Kristin, you are my favorite. You can be a slut, you can be a bitch, but at least you're fun and true to yourself. Lauren, or.. LC, you are an annoying little leech who doesn't admit when she is being jealous (on no grounds) because she is crushing on someone. Or when she should honorably admit defeat and retreat before all dignity is gone. Oh, and don't go camping if you don't like the outdoors, prissy bitch loser."

"event","Dear ****,<br /><br />I was thinking back on the semester and decided I owe you; there are some things that should be straightened out.<br /><br />It's true that I was extremely disappointed that one time and probably not ready to be like we were. I know that to most people, it wouldn't have been a big deal, but to me it was. Because I used to be a much more private person when it came to friendship itself, so something like this is the stuff of my worst nightmares. I was upset with ### as well.<br /><br />So let me say first that I'm sorry. I told you we would be fine and friends as before, but the end of the year shows that never happened the way it should have. I, myself, in my stubbornness, am just getting over the whole debacle. At first we'd still say hello in the hallways, but eventually that all disintegrated to an awkward sort of let's-pretend-the-other-person-isn't-there. At the time what I saw was that you weren't making any particular effort to further mend what happened between us, and I surely wasn't cooled down enough to do it myself. Either you were too scared or I was too unforgiving.<br />So when you never made the first hello, the first how're you, I stopped. And we retreated to essentially ignoring each other. Correct me if I'm wrong. This isn't supposed to be blaming you for anything. I just want you to know what I was and am thinking. And to let you know I'm sorry about how I treated you.<br /><br />I know most of my friends didn't understand, and I don't blame them. I'm sure your friendships with them were affected as well. There's no time for regrets; the only thing to do is clear the air. In particular, I'd like to tell you that ### was upset with me for how I handled things, and felt the loss of your friendship. $$, however she may have seemed, really forgot (in an $$ sort of way) and didn't care either way - she only continued treating you less than you should have, because she was following my lead, which she definitely shouldn't have been doing. I'm sorry for that, which is also my fault.<br /><br />I think that sums up what I wanted to say. In the future I hope I will handle these situations with more grace and openness. I don't know if you're upset with me; I wouldn't blame you if you were. I don't know if you'll write back, and I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.<br /><br />Sincerely and thanks for hearing me out,<br />Margaret<br /><br />PS- When I think back on the beginning and then on the end, I feel undeserving. I still have your letter; when I read it I look at what happened later, I find my character lacking and blinded to your sincerity. I hope I can be forgiven, in the least.<br /><br /><br /><br />Margaret,<div><br /></div><div>Thank you. &nbsp;I really appreciate your letter/e-mail and willingness to put things behind us. &nbsp;I would have responded sooner but was out of town and without internet access.</div><div> <br /></div><div>I guess the ironic thing is that I felt almost the same as you did. &nbsp;Disappointed, confused, and maybe a little rude at the end. &nbsp;For your actions, I figured I had offended you too badly and stopping trying to keep things normal after a couple weeks. &nbsp;Again, I apologize for any misunderstanding and ill feelings I caused.</div> <div><br /></div><div>This summer I realized that I am never, and I mean never, the first person to say hello. &nbsp;I always reply to a greeting, but I never initiate one even though I know it is coming and the appropriate timing. &nbsp;I can't explain it. &nbsp;I've been working on it at work, but the words never seem to come out. &nbsp;So, its seems I am doomed to be shy forever. &nbsp;</div> <div><br /></div><div>Forgive me for any lack of greetings and let me be the first (sort of) to say hello this summer.</div><div><br /></div><div>How's your summer been? &nbsp;Hopefully better than mine. &nbsp;You went across the Pacific again didn't you? &nbsp;</div> <div><br /></div><div>See you back in Ithaca,<br /><br />****</div><div>&nbsp;<br />And now you have three entries about you. Three too many? Three, the end.</div>"

"event","It is common knowledge that asians look ageless. The 40 year old married woman looks to be in grade school. The 55 year old menopausal one still looks no older than 30. 
But really, now? Is it that unusual for two college students to enter a Toys 'R Us in the interest of buying a new SuperSmash Wii game mid-summerafternoon? It is really more likely for them to be happily married with a couple kids popped out?
""Do you guys have a phone number?"" the cashier asks, looking questioningly from me to him. ""..."" I think. Like we're a couple.
""Do you two need a gift receipt?"" What, are we buying this for our third grandchild or something?
Admittedly I gave it no second thought, simply writing it off to the man's clear incapability to distinguish singular from plural, but as it was later brought up it became a funny fact. The man thought we were married, and buying the damn video game for a kid. Sorry to disappoint. We immediately drove back to his house, popped the thing in, and played dual-adventure mode until it was 13% complete.
Eat that."

"event","At first she thought her contact was getting too dry. As she washed her hands, she resisted the urge to reach in and rid herself of the irresistible scratch. Then her arms and legs joined in on the itchy, and suddenly something was weird. She felt like she'd been arguing with her parents, to no avail, to the point that her entire body seemed to be rejecting the situation. But her parents were at work. <br />Stumbling out of the bathroom, eyes welling with tears, she saw the startled look in her friend's eyes. A glance in the mirror showed her the monster she had become. Puffy, blood-filled eyes, red bumps forming on her skin, swollen throat. She entertained the thought of this being like those people in the movies who get a bee sting, inflate like a blimp, blow up and die. As she took it all in, thinking she looked laughably scary, like a really badly made-up monster in a low budget horror movie starring some no-talent celeb like Paris Hilton, ... then she realized this was getting serious. Air was having trouble filling her lungs, and water just wouldn't go down her pipe. Her friend started frantically searching for the car keys, which of course had decided to become lost. <br />Treating the 35 mile per hour slow-zone like a highway, the ER was under ten minutes away. As her feet pounded the asphalt and she stormed the hospital, she heard her inner ""FEE FIIEE FOOO FUMM!"" She barely made out the stares of horror in the waiting room through her slitty swollen eyes. For once, the nurses realized the paperwork was to be skipped. <br />Weren't they supposed to strip her clothes off? Cut them? Or, if a particularly hot doctor were on call, she wouldn't have minded if he'd ripped them off with his teeth. No, the gown went on over her clothes. The sticky round heart monitoring mechanisms went on her chest, her belly. Multiple needs gave the necessary fluids. And all the while she was too embarrassed to go to sleep.<br />While her throat was clearing up with the help of an oxygen mask, they asked repeatedly for her age and her name. As if she hadn't said it clearly enough the first five times. She tried to roll her eyes at her friend, especially when the doctor repeatedly went for these pathetic rub-pat hybrids on her shoulder, but her newly asian eyes proved impossible to maneuver. The IV smelled familiar. The biggest difference was, this time she wasn't drunk. Oh, what she would have given just to be drunk off her ass.<br />Official diagnosis? Unknown food allergy. A shot of epinephrine, a dose of Benedryl, administering of steroids, and the swelling started to cease. The list of foods the two had gone through that afternoon was extensive and lengthy. Ah, the beauty of two healthy young adult female appetites. Pistachios, cranberry juice, cherries, tacos, cheese sandwiches, strawberry cocktails. <br />She tried to keep sane by glancing at her friend, who she was very proud of for speeding twice the speed limit. But it only became awkward when conversation became limited. She wished her parents were there. <br />A phone call and thirty minutes later, the awkwardness had tripled. Her parents were there.<br />They turned on the TV in an attempt to cut the silence, as she tried to keep breathing, but no one was watching. <br /><br />Alone in the hospital room, relieved of the awkward pervy doctor, all visitors gone, she texted her friend. <br /><br />9:18 pm: So i had a big allergic reaction to something. Staying overnight in hospital.<br />9:19 pm: Wtf!<br />9:19 pm: I know right<br />9:20 pm: Which one? R ur parents back yet?<br />9:21 pm: Yea they don't know. Will c allergy doc freaky eh<br />9:22 pm: WHERE ARE YOU!<br />9:30 pm: Batt dying don't worry i'm fine<br />9:37 pm: Too late. If u told me where u are i wouldnt worry<br /><br />The friend was going out of her mind, trying to decide which hospitals to call first. M******* D***, where are you!?? She frantically called her parents over - M's alone, her parents are still in Taiwan! We gotta go see her, she can't be alone at a hospital!<br /><br />10:13 pm: I'm at st. Joe? Watch thepsych season primere<br /><br />The message came a little late.<br />Visit Log: <br />Patient arrives with friend H. <br />Patient's parents arrive. <br />H, parents leave. <br />H's parents arrive, leave.<br />H and sister arrive, leave.<br />Patient's mom returns.<br />Friend C and family arrives, leaves.<br /><br />She was deeply touched by C. As an afterthought, she realized it might have been better to tell her about the whole incident the next day when it wasn't 11 o'clock pm. But she was selfishly glad she had done it anyway. C's dad offered to leave C, as a slave. <br />He laughed, ""I can so imagine you calling over to Charis every five seconds, oh, ouch this pillow is a bit hard, C fluff it for me?""<br />""Yeah that would last maybe half an hour, tops.""<br />""No, I wouldn't refuse! I'd totally do it all night,"" C protested.<br />""Yeah, then you'd get me back for it later,"" the swelled eyes laughed.<br />Everyone laughed.<br />""Yeah they gave me steroids,"" the swelled eyes continued, ""and I really wanted to ask if I can get buff if I work out the next two days.""<br />Everyone laughed.<br /><br />The nurses constantly told her, ""Wow! You look <i>so</i> much better!"" Was that supposed to make her feel good? She'd seen the mirror. She still looked like a deformed Japanese girl. That only meant her appearance before had been utterly ridiculous. No, that didn't make her feel better.<br /><br />The room she was to stay in overnight was rather nice. Private bathroom, well lit, cable tv (for an extra $6). The cafeteria was closed, so she decided to raid the patient pantry. Pushing her IV rack on her right, she beeped her way to the Cocoa Puffs. Just as they were safely in her hand, the white lights on the ceiling started flashing, accompanied by a shrill siren. What?? She felt like a felon trying to escape, as nurses rushed to her side. Then she realized the sirens were from someone smoking on the other end of the hospital.<br /><br />Dr. Song seemed was very competent. Very asian. He promised to find out what food she had developed an allergy to within the next two weeks. He explained things twice over, then three times. She just wanted to leave the hospital, before any scariness could sink into her thick skin."

I used to think these were impossible rules to break, ingrained in my dna, the core of my very being. And then the other day, I proved myself wrong. <br />I not only stepped foot into Abercrombie and Fitch - I made a purchase. Yes, please cue the dramatic music.<br />In my defense, I didn't enter the place voluntarily. I was dragged tooth and nail by a very determined five foot friend. As I stood around returning curious glances with challenging glares, like, hell yes I'm wearing Target merchandise and Kohl's clearance flip flops in Abercrombie, you got a problem bitch? - something caught my eye. My ultimate weakness. <br />I'm not sure what it is about stripes. Perhaps it's the ultimate declaration of indecisiveness, or a person who gets all that they want. I want something white, I want something blue, and I <i>will </i>have both, damn it.<br />Whatever it may be, the shirt seemed to be calling my name, with it's cheery yellow lining.

A more suitable home would have been Pac Sun, next to the skull-adorned skate-caps. <br />I rescued the shirt from its horrible alluringly-scented, scantily clothed dwelling. And the never-do list of my life was forever changed. Yes, this so-called ""list"" didn't officially exist until today, but - cross off number four.<br /><br />Why live by negatives, by things one can't do?<br /><br />1) Pink is not a legit color to wear, or caress.<br />2) The speed limit is a very light suggestion, meant to be ignored.<br />3) Apples are for eating, not surfing the web.<br />4) Hollister? Abercrombie? Me stepping there is like a felon visiting the police station.<br />5) Where I live cannot smell. It just can't.<br />6) Don't stress out, because chances are you can spend your time doing better.<br />7) Rules suck, never blindly follow them. Nothing is absolute. Except vodka."

"event","Life is full of misunderstandings. And not understanding. 
Let's take you. The reason why it hit me so hard was I really liked you. And when that became insufficient for me to keep waiting, when I let it all hang out and we became a compromised-sort of friend to one another, you did it. Maybe in your mind, it wasn't a big deal; you weren't betraying anything. To me, you betrayed everything. My trust, my faith, my conviction. 
I used to be even more independent than I am now. I was the one people confided in; I was the one who gave. Now I tell you more, and there's more room for weakness. It's a good price to pay, for living. You found a way to my greatest fear unknowingly- a betrayal of minimal trust that I never saw coming. Not only that - you did it inaccurately. Which only showed you hardly knew me well enough to do it right.
So I dealt with the situation, more saddened and disappointed than angry. I still said hello how're you in the halls, I waved - but those dwindled when I saw was always the first. You seemed to ignore me, or not have the guts to speak up and prove me otherwise. So I ignored you back. I was tired of reaching out, of asking questions, of forcing words out of your silent mouth. If you really wanted it, you could have tried reaching for a change. It's not like I'd have slapped your hand away.
By my standards, my spectrum of nice to mean, my mean is sadly lacking. So perhaps ignoring you became mean. But I refuse to accept immaturity as the reason, even if it became the facade. I wonder how you felt about it. It can't have felt good. Did you feel undeserving? Did you resent me? Whatever the case, you made no effort to change what it was.
I returned your Chemistry book, and saw you packing your things away into cardboard boxes. Goodbye was slow, forced, and awkward. Hugging seemed inappropriate. If no one saw me say farewell, did it really ever happen?
I don't think I can be described as a drama queen in any typical real-life situation I've been seen in. Do you think it applies here? Let me explain to you. I don't care if you spill milk on me, I don't care if you punch me, if you insult me to my face. But I don't give trust away lightly. This was not an exaggeration in my mind, and I told you straight. I was disappointed and I was let down. I didn't pigeonhole you into a ditch, and laugh at you from outside. I gave you a ladder and you didn't climb up it. So I watched with sad eyes and I eventually, slowly, walked away. 
Next year, I'll say hello how was your summer. The world is too small for regrets. I have none concerning how I dealt with this situation; I intend to have none in the future."

"event","So maybe I should've known that when the job description is ""oh, it's not door-to-door sales, nor is it telemarketing"" Vector meant deceitful trouble. But I went to the group interview in Livonia, sat on a hardass plastic chair, and dutifully took notes while coming across as the most desirable potential employee for 90 long minutes.
By the end, I must say, I was rather effectively brainwashed. Good thing Google informed me of what people call the ""Vector Cutco scam."" I myself wouldn't call it a scam - more like a street smart, business decision. 
It is undeniable that Cutco products are of high quality; with their bowling ball-material handles, specially designed wedgelock handles to battle arthritis, and recessed Double-D edge that lasts for 10 years, it all accumulates to an impressive resume. But really, people. Who the hell needs a pair of scissors that can cut through pennies? 
What they don't explicitly tell you is, it's all up to you to build your base of customers - assuming each family/friend gives you two contacts, you'll be up and running in no time! Too bad you're forcing overpriced non-needed merchandise on mere acquaintances, awkwardly standing in their home kitchen. Vector preys on young people in their 20s, who are money hungry with stars bursting from their eyes at the promise of 14.25/appointment basepay. I myself choose to spare myself and give my morals a chance to stay standing. The guilt would just be too much.
Yeah, good luck. I recommend doing what my good friend did; go into the interview, see them for their bullshit, and book it out of there before your ass hurts from sitting in their damn cheap plastic chairs for too long."

"event","Her heart sent blood pulsing through her body in waves, mimicking the glowing screen behind her. The ruffles of her skirt - scattered with spring flowers, while the wearer's time had long passed - blew against her legs as the silent fan revolved dutifully. Just like many things in their marriage, it had been chosen especially for its silence.
Everything was different. Everything - was the same. And she could ignore it no longer. With one angry swipe she sent most of the toiletries clattering to the floor, leaving the blue toothbrush swaying, mocking. Unused for months now. She wouldn't give it the satisfaction; it, too, was flung to the floor.
And there it was, the glint of freedom - one she didn't dare refuse, for it offered her only escape from this tedious life filled with shame and humiliation everywhere she cared to look. Suddenly she didn't care anymore.

The phone was ringing again. But this time she made no move to pick it up; she knew who it was, and she didn't want to talk. How did it turn out this way? How could her heart decide before her mind approved? She never thought she'd be the other woman. Having to endure the shame of harassment, from the wife who couldn't keep her man.

An old dying man might find every day more and more trying, more and more difficult. Why live on? To steal a couple more days filled with pain, to escape the snatches of death? His oldest son from America calls twice a week, and visits once a month. His second son cheats on his wife in China. His third comes every day to see him after work. His youngest temporarily moved in and cooks nutrition-balanced meals daily. 
A grandson motions for him to sit, gives him a free massage.
A granddaughter offers a high five, and a smile; so stupid, so mundane - so young, it's an act of vibrant life. So perfect. He smiles back.

Every added day seems like a surprise extension to a prison sentence; and the day drives the prisoner to mania. Ugly words refuse to be leashed, subtle daggers penetrate the greatest defenses. Suddenly I'm ten years old, acting the petulant child I never was."

It might be my little way of fulfilling your expectations. People look at me and see a smiling, laughing soul. They hear me from miles away. Whenever I find life tiring enough to cease smiling for maybe five minutes at a time, I'm immediately bombarded with What's wrong?s, and Holy crap why are you so sad?s. It's a good reputation to have, I could say. I'm superhuman. I never get sad. I never cry. I'm never bummed out for too long at a time. I want you to know whatever happens you can come to me. With anything. Because I know when to turn it off, I know when a joke's inappropriate. I can be serious for you, too. I can be serious for myself.

So I ended up throwing out or donating much of my crap. Now I wonder why I held on to all of it for so long. How much sentimental value can a shirt hold? In a way I bet it would be neat to be able to walk through your life by sorting through old boxes. I guess that's what attics are for. But really now? I can do without.
I'm back in my own room now, and it's too full. The shelves are groaning and tired of being overweight. 
I keep things thinking, but what if I need to use it or want to use it someday? But that day never comes. And the future always holds replacements with alternatives. Goodbye, shit. I will donate you, and do away with you. I'm cutting off this trail of loose threads that I drag around every day. You'd get caught in some stranger's car door, anyway.
I admire the minimalist. Is it wasteful? You could see it that way. But then everything seems universal. Personal ownership - is it all that important? Why must possessiveness rule our lives? To have something our own, that's what we always strive for. Many a time to represent and prove to the world that we have earned it, to landmark our achievements and our lives. 
But the ugliest shirt ever, that you've had since sixth grade? Or that one Walkman from first grade? How much do you need to remember? How much can you just leave behind and plunge on into things that aren't memories? Things that are nonexistent, potential. 
And you know why I'm writing this? To avoid cleaning my room. Too much shit."

I don't think I can express into words how it feels. Neither can I summarize how the year was. Besides amazing.
I'm not sure what expectations I had when I came into freshman year, but I know what I'll have when I return. Next semester I'll return to another home. One where gorges take the place of roads, and where everyone's actually a dork - some are just dorkier than others. Thank you Animal Farm.
If you look at the year, the switches and passes and fumbles are everywhere. Friendships are thrown into the air and sometimes they're never caught. But by the end it's all fallen into place, and I love what I see when I look left, right, up, down. It makes me smile when I remember you guys in my room as I checked out - because hell if I would have cleaned that shit out, I'm half blind to things right before me a quarter of the time.
Just one person opening the drawer, another laughing at the change on the ground, yet another picking up the vacuum, and maybe something else sitting motionless like a rock in the corner. That's all it takes for a smile.
And when Cayuga Taxi pulled away, (this is before the driver tried to convert me to Christianity), we hugged and we hugged and we waved and someone cried. All I thought about as I smiled through the back of the cab, waving my hand off, was nothing. Because I felt it.

This entails two main items: 1) a fishing pole, and 2) a kite - with maybe a bit of wind, luck, and pursuit of happiness.<br />Kites are kind of like that part of us that wishes we could let go; but we can't, so we stay on the ground holding the string that prevents the kite from flying away.

Should you never complete this cycle of three properly, well - I guess you're missing out on the Cornellian experience. I probably should have told my prefrosh that.<br />I always think I'm stronger, smarter, and braver than I really am. That way, I push myself to my fullest potential. But Slope Day? Maybe not such a good idea. I ate an apple, and maybe half a bagel - rinsed down with some liquor, some Smirnoff, and lots more vodka. Needless to say, the second half of the day is a time of my life forever lost to me, although my friends have not hesitated to fill me in with a play by play.<br />I'll reduce it to bullet points. Time to break it down. <br /><u><br />What to do when drunk on Slope Day:</u><br /><u>On The Slope:</u><br />-dance with half your hall<br />-fall, a lot<br />-make out with your gay friend... twice<br />-fall<br />-throw up<br />-throw up<br />-wait... oh yeah, throw up<br />-get pointed out by a stranger and carted away on the drunk truck<br /><u>At Gannett</u><br />When they ask you these questions, try to keep your answers as close to the following as possible:<br />Where are you?<br />Slope Day.<br />What day is it?<br />Thursday.<br />What's the date?<br />May 17th!<br />(If they ask you again, make sure you keep your answers consistent - but you can always change location.)<br />Where are you?<br />...Willard Straight!<br />Yes, yes we are. No wait! No we aren't! <br />Yes, the nurses occasionally get fooled. So don't think that you have no power or charisma as a drunk. Charm their orthopedic socks off.<br />-throw up<br />-lie down on one of the cots amidst the rest of the drunken refugees<br />-drink water<br />-throw up<br />-throw up<br />-pour the water on the carpet because you can't drink any more and the nurse is just an evil bitch who has an unlimited supply of refills<br />-ask your friend to chug it<br />-get caught asking<br />-get another refill<br />-throw up<br /><br />I think that just about covers it. <br />When I first got back my head was swimming with all the possibilities - bad ones. I would pass people in the hall and hold my breath, as if they might outright shout ""oh my god, it's you, the drunken ho from Libe Slope!"" Then I realized, so what? Should I regret getting screwed up just a couple weeks after writing my sharply worded reflection to the Resident Hall Director? No, not really. I've worked hard to live without regrets. So I'm okay with missing half the day, not seeing Gym Class Heroes (because I heard they were crappy), not seeing Hot Hot Heat (I heard they are jerks and went to Lynroc to try to pick up college girls - did I mention they're in their 30's?), although there is one thing I'm sorry about:<br />I'm sorry to have inconvenienced my friends. A couple of them really stayed with me, for which I'm grateful. I'm sure I was a little amusing, but who would want to spend their afternoon in Gannett? A friend who would just stay there while I slept, for that I have nothing to say. I felt so bad that I kept asking them to leave, but to no avail. So this I neglect to regret as well. Because, hell, it made my stay a hell of a lot better since they were there. So I will say sorry right now, and thank you forever.<br />Sure, that much vodka was probably a bad idea. I have to take another alcohol class and I'll probably graduate the courses by the time I leave Cornell. But I wouldn't call it a mistake; it's an experience to learn from. <br /><br /><b>No regrets. It's not that I'm pigheaded, or unable to admit I'm wrong. But if I view the situation as an experience, then why see it as a mistake? The word mistake seems like a copout and an excuse in itself. Oops, ""mis-take."" Like you want a do-over? Sorry, man. Life doesn't really give those out in large quantities, or really, ever. Life is permanent, and that's why life is so real. You can't rewind and tape over a section that you want to forget. The word mistake gives people a label, an excuse for what they did. They label it as a mistake, like it somehow relieves them a little of responsibility. Well you know what? You made the decision to do that. Think about it. Accept it. And move on. Don't cut it out and try to throw it in the trash. Or just stare at it without knowing how to deal. Recycle.</b>"

"event","I don't put a lot of faith in most people, so that they don't have to let me down. I don't mean that in a cynical ""Damn how I hate the world"" sense. It's more like ""no pressure-"" with a shrug and a smile. Knowing me is light, and I wouldn't dump my problems on just anyone. 
So I try not to count on others to keep me standing, because if they failed, we'd both be screwed. The little faith I do invest is scattered, and scarce. Usually the people don't even know they have it. It's the little things, things they should have no trouble keeping one-armed, one-legged, and half asleep -I don't have high expectations. Maybe I think I can count on you for a smile every once in a while, or a moment of being able to sit without talking about much at all. But recently I seem to have been let go and let down.
One I basically relieved of all responsibility. Sure, sometimes I make fun of him but from my point of view he well deserves it. And I don't do it to anyone but my closer friends. In him my faith was minimal; it was simple - I didn't even know it existed until he broke it. I was counting on him not to be bitter, or just plain rude. After all, I'm the one with something to be bitter about. But asking about me and that one guy, and then saying ""oh I feel sorry for him?"" This I'm not going to touch.
The next I also thought I had let off the hook. Until he and one of my close friends start talking and the shit comes down the drain. This was a huge disappointment, although I feel a bit off that she was talking to him about this in the first place. Sure, I confronted him immediately. I gave him a chance or two to explain himself. Himself, being big and inarticulate, apparently had nothing to explain. He didn't even admit to all he had said, which is just another pang in the side. But really, it changes nothing - whether he abandoned the war by backing up 50 feet or 100, both are equally horrifying in their cowardice. He said sorry, and on the inside, I said goodbye. He talked about me to someone I was good friends with (and yet having trouble with) as if he knew me, which, he doesn't. Obviously. Someone might say, not for lack of trying, but you know what? I don't give a crap anymore. When we were a possibility, I was there 24 7 and he was just mentally gone. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bitch. I'm nice. I say hello, I ask how was your Sunday. But it makes me sick to my stomach to stay any longer and I haven't been able to hold much down lately.
And the last. This one hit the most because I wasn't prepared. I hadn't cut anything off, and I was caught blindsided. I felt really bad about what happened. When I make an effort to contact you it means something, because anyone can tell you I rarely call and I rarely ever call twice. At the risk of worsening the situation at the time, I restricted myself to a text and a message on his door. And then I knew that was all I could do, because I don't want to have to kidnap the damn boy off the street. If he doesn't find me himself then there's no point is there. I just didn't know the loss was that important to me. 
After not being able to see him for four months, one Saturday may have effectively ruined whatever we never had. People tell me it wasn't my fault, but I refuse to make excuses for myself. So I'm sitting here feeling a little shitty. And the next day he makes it official with a girl he's been off and on with for about forever - something that doesn't bother me, but makes it obvious that he has time on his hands. Time with which he has not contacted me, either from not having thought of me, or from ignoring his thoughts. 
It hurts, a little. It hurts because I pass the guy on the street and I'm ignored. I can't be hard to recognize; how many five foot ten asian girls are there on campus? So I'm writing this in preparation for the worst. So I can protect myself if it should happen. It's insurance, and it's closure to every time my speakers buzz and my cellphone receives anything, when my body jumps and I look to it and it's still not him. Does that sound sad, or pining? It's not that bad. But it hurts a little more every time. I had to put a stop to that. When my eyes get tired from looking at the world, I sleep to deny old tears from gaining freedom. I just don't have the time to sleep right now.
Next time my phone rings I'll know it won't be him. And I'll be fine. I've just stumbled a little bit, and I have to get up."

"event","Sometimes you forget to think. And then something happens and suddenly all you're doing is thinking. 

You can't really tell me I did nothing wrong; I feel guilty; something's wrong. 
I guess I'm an impatient person when it comes to resolving issues. When I realize there's an issue, I have the urge to immediately get it out of the way. 
To me, time seems like an unlikely solution. The more time passes, the further you're going to drift apart. Or time might allow the two of you to pretend nothing happened - but you both know it's still there and nothing will ever be the same. People say, ""Give him/her time-"" who can ""give"" someone time? Really what that means is leave it alone. Let time let it rot. It's all in the hopes that one person might give, and compromise or at least forgive. But if nothing changed from the original situation, I find it unlikely their decision might change in sincerity.
I guess the marking point, his deadline, is this weekend. 
I don't know if it's actually that big of a deal to him; I can only wait and see what happens now."

"event","<b>Disclaimer:</b> all quotes are taken from facebook friends so nothing personal, it was just good evidence and I was bored; all opinions expressed are uncensored and thus I am not held responsible; damn I'm hungry.<br />So today I had a bout of extreme boredom (not the most unusual circumstances, I know). Guess what I did? The embarrassing habit that is facebooking. I go to the site, click on Profile, and immediately start getting annoyed.&nbsp; <br /> I mean, the second line on the page is ""What are you doing right now?"" Okay, that's for me to know and you to find out - NOT through a facebook status. What right does facebook have to ask that? That's personal information. It's not like I'm besties with facebook, or everyone who is my ""friend,"" for that matter. I'm sure I don't know at least ten people under my friends section, not going to lie.<br /> And then I click on ""Friends-"" I mean, why the hell not, I've gotten this far haven't I? Up loads the list of people who recently changed their statuses.<br /> <b>There are the people who use their status to complain about their work</b>: so-and-so ""really does not feel like doing this lab report"" or ""wishes school was over already"" or&nbsp;<span class=""fstatus""> ""is poorly choosing to procrastinate studying for his prelims in order to philosophize about the consequences of parallel universes.""</span> Fine, you need to vent a little. But isn't it a bit sad you're doing it to facebook? Because, ironically, facebook is FACELESS. People are represented in two-dimensional photographs made of pixels. Do you really not have anyone 3D to complain to in person? Or, as is many a case I'm sure, do you really need to supplement your nonstop complaining in person with a textual label that tells the facebooking world (essentially the world) that you're academically frustrated? Frankly, if you're all that sad, do yourself a favor and drop out.&nbsp; <br /> <b>Then there are the ones who go for the pity factor</b> - they're always either ""disappointed...again"" or ""<span class=""fstatus"">wishes she could take a mental health break from life"" or </span>""<span class=""fstatus"">had a really bad day...AND UR ONLY MAKIN IT WORSE!!"" They're begging someone to glance over and feel a spark of compassion, maybe enough to send ""a hug"" or ""a beer"" or even write on their wall asking what's wrong. Well, guess what. </span>We don't pity you. Everyone has their problems, just deal with it. Eat, if that makes you feel better.<br /> <b>There are those who use it for advertising, or mass-communication</b>; they're always saying ""<span>thank you for all the birthday wishes!!!!"" or ""go to www.gunthernet.com"" or ""come to my dance performance at 4:00 pm Saturday night at Barton Hall!"" First of all, if you really cared about the people you were trying to reach, you'd do it in person or individually, at least. Secondly, what's with this crap? Do you believe you're furthering mankind by wasting our time? Fine, maybe I'll give you that one.<br /> </span><b>And don't forget the ones that are just too specific or trying too damn hard to be clever</b> - this person ""<span class=""fstatus"">just looks too cool sometimes"" or ""</span><span class=""fstatus"">is taking the line integral of his mental anguish from here to Rockefeller and back... it isn't conservative..."" or ""</span><span class=""fstatus"">just got back from chillin with Chuck from Cool Kids! The night was AWSOME. Its mad late tho. pce."" Really? Really?? Oh my god. NO WAY. But you know what? I actually don't care. Like, I actually. Don't. I'm sorry I don't give a shit. Well, actually I'm not. You're a douchebag.<br /> <br /> Venting is nice to do, especially on a personal blog. Life is full of contradictions; but I can proudly say I have not touched my ""What are you doing right now?"" for at least two weeks and going strong.</span>"

"event","<div align=""left"">SO I'm sure you are ALL falling off the edges of your seats wondering how the hell rush went, and how the hell I could put myself through something that has DEATH stamped all over it. Gee, thank you!<br /> <br /> <b>If you want to skip to the good stuff because I feel this will be a relatively long entry (although ALL OF IT WILL BE GOOD SHIT) skip to the Guy Rush part. You do not want to miss reading that, trust me.</b><br /> <b><br /> </b> <div align=""center""><b>Girl Rush</b><br /> </div> I get to Cornell and rush to get a new ID AFTER which I return to my room and discover it was sitting in my desk. (Fuck that!) Rush starts the next day, and let me just say it was herds and herds of UGG-wearing (1 UGG 2 UGG red UGGs blue UGGs black UGGs pink UGGs every-imaginable-shade-of-brown UGGs) mindless drones.&nbsp; I feel like most of the people who want to join a sorority so bad are basically looking for guarantees. A guaranteed friend, or maybe a moneyback guarantee if they don't like it.&nbsp; Anyway I'm not all that hungry not to mention desperate to put myself through physical and mental torture for seven days straight. So I quit after two days. <br /> Now don't get me wrong, I would like to express my respect for all those crazies that actually went through it (my friend May ended up doing it, but not getting any bids) and I'm not insulting them in any way. BUT SERIOUSLY. Not my kind of people. I met some nice girls in the sororities, yes. But afterwards I discovered something oh so shocking.<br /> THEY HAVE HORRIBLE MOVIE TASTE! Like, what the fuck. All of them were raving their foaming asses off about Juno. Many told me they laughed the entire way through. So I watch this movie with the expectation of some comic relief. What I get is some dumbass movie about some pregnant girl and everyone in it's screwed up not to mention UNFUNNY. <br /> So after I quit, my friends and I were waiting for a bus and some guys were standing in front of us. Now, before I continue, allow me to explain you something. Rushing for girls is hell on earth. It is all about hour-long appointments from house to house, meeting all the girls in the sororities. You enter the house in groups and they scream at you to greet you. Literally, scream. Then it's all awkward when they help you take your coat and lead you to a seat to have mind-BORING conversation. (Most of the time, anyway.) These appointments with the houses are required. If you miss ANY, you are disqualified from the entire process. Thus, it's GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS. Doubly thus, as herds of sorority girls are walking around campus, they lack a certain amount of testosterone. Whenever guys are sighted, the heads bob and turn and contemplate attack.<br /> We're watching the UGGly drones walk past us and the guys, and each one of them UNFAILINGLY checks out the guys. (Not that I wouldn't have.) It's just even funnier because we are counting their shoes. How many UGGs can you get? I lost count after I counted 10 within 2 seconds. Anyway, we hear the guys in front of us counting, too. My friend NJ turns to me and is like, OMG! They're counting UGGs too!! We start laughing, and then we realize - one of them just skipped from 7 to 10. <br /> PSH THAT'S NOT HOW YOU COUNT. Wait. They're RATING the girls as they walk by. WHAT DOUCHES! HAHAHAHAH!!! <br /> <br /> <div align=""center""><b>Guy Rush</b><br /> <div align=""left"">If you haven't read the previous section, Girl Rush is absolute shit. Notice the lack of an article. I did not write ""THE SHIT."" I wrote just plain ""SHIT."" So I hope you understand it means, bad. GUY rush, however, is entirely much more enjoyable.<br /> A) They do not have to pay a registration fee of 30 dollars. What a ripoff.<br /> B) They are not required to make any stops at all the houses.<br /> C) They go wherever the fuck they want to, whenever the fuck they want to.<br /> D) They get booze and food.<br /> E ) WTF, right??<br /> So my friend NJ and I have a brilliant beyond brilliant beyond ridiculous beyond stupid-yet-hilarious-and-genious idea. We are going to dress up as guys and rush a frat. <br /> <br /> Yeah, you might want to take a second to read that over once more.<br /> <br /> And yes, we did it.<br /> <br /> MMmmmmmhm.<br /> <br /> Ready for the story?<br /> <br /> Here goes!<br /> <br /> The first task is wardrobe. Funny enough, I end up wearing all my own clothes (which perhaps says a little something about the way I dress). NJ borrows a bunch of shit from Kendrick. <br /> Next, the walk and the crotch-scratch. Which... we never really got down. I always ended up doing like a little gyration pop dance thing with my ass whenever I tried. Which, let me tell you, got a few laughs. <br /> Right. Names. Hey, Jason Wu. Nice to meet you. OH SHIT IT RHYMES, hahaha. So the ""Nice to meet you"" was cut. NJ? Jamal Jenkins. Yes. You heard me. Jason and Jamal.<br /> We're practicing how to talk like guys when Pat, our guy RA walks in. After this incident we know he has completely fallen in love with us and thinks we're hilarious. Same with my girl RA. WHO, by the way, just found out I was engineer and was totally shocked. So Pat and Cole end up helping us practice, but really we're all just goofing off and decide we're going to wing it.<br /> That night, we go out to Kappa Sig with Cole. He is our piece of legit-ness. As he's... actually a guy. As we're walking down the streets we're all giddy and proud of ourselves cause we're fooling the people walking past us. We see people coming and we shove each other to act serious and gangsta. Then after they pass we're all giggling and YES HAHAHA WE DID IT. We get to Kappa Sig, and get in no problem - the security guards aren't really paying attention, and when they glance at us we give them the nod.<br /> But once we're in we realize there's basically no one at this party except brothers. DAMN. Talking seems inevitable. Sure enough, two brothers immediately approach us and introduce themselves. Cole introduces himself in a manly manner masterfully. I'm looking the other way to avoid talking, but Cole shoves me and goes, ""Yo J!"" So it's my turn. I do the handshake GREAT and manly. BUT THEN.<br /> My voice comes out ALL WRONG. It's like the girliest I've ever spoken. ""Jason."" <br /> All the same, the guy moves on to NJ, who, after hearing me, is way too eager to get her name out (we're both getting scared shitless) so she cuts him off as she goes, ""Jamal."" He goes, ""What was that?"" She LEANS IN TOWARDS HIS EAR LIKE A GIRL and goes, ""Jamal."" <br /> Then the guy turns back to me, and says, ""Sorry what was your name?"" In a slightly more manly way, I mumble, ""Jason."" <br /> Pause.<br /> ""Do you go by a girl's name, too?""<br /> <u>My face:</u> offended confusion. My feelings: SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!!<br /> <u>NJ's face:</u> SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!! In the most obvious girly way possible. NJ's feelings: SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!! in the most girly way possible.<br /> <u>Cole's face:</u> OFFENDED LIKE A MAN. Cole's reaction: ""WHAT?"" all manly and offended-like. Cole's feelings: SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!!<br /> After this there is a long, awkward, silence. Yeah. Then they go, ""...Nevermind. The beer's behind us."" I'm sure they were EXTREMELY confused.<br /> As they walk away NJ hears one say, ""Is this some kind of joke?""<br /> We stand awkwardly next to the beer. NJ is facing the entire frat with an OH SHIT THEY FOUND US OUT face and going, ""Margaret, Margaret!! They know!!!!"" Yeah. We decide to leave.<br /> As we walk out Cole hears the brother talking to the security guards - ""Some ... weird <b>people</b> just showed up and left.""<br /> Note how the word ""people"" was used. <br /> THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING OF THE WEEK. I hope I brightened your day, too. I can never fail to crack up when I think about this. Plus I'll never live down the girly Jason thing. People were banking on NJ screwing up first! Cole admitted he knew things would go wrong and he just came along to see. (Our whole hall saw us dressed up as guys/practicing, and half our hall's guys said they passed us on the street.)<br /> </div> </div> <br /> </div> <div align=""left""> </div>"

"event","Well first of all, I kind of am loving my freshman writing seminar - admittedly, at first I was completely not into it, and relatively scared of the teacher. But then we had a conference and she was pretty chill; now I love her. (I missed my first appointment but she wasn't that mad, plus she was on valium for mouth surgery.)

We were talking about time and what it is - or what society thinks it is. Or maybe just what society needs it to be. What if time was just sometime our brains implemented to enable us to survive, understand, and organize the world? If everything were happening at the ""same time"" except we need to view things sequentially.

Anyway. 
<b>Life is like traffic.</b> Especially in America, everyone feels the need to have their own space, and stay in their own car. Personal space is important, so you can't drive too close to the person in front of you. Then again, there will always be those tailgaiters- you either think they're funny or they piss you off. 
<b>You may be driving down the same road</b> as someone in life, a friend, a lover, but how long will that last? When will you take a different turn, a detour, or a dead end?
<b>You're choosing to go down the same road as them - or maybe you aren't.</b> If you are, then when will you lose them? Find them again? Will they stop on the side of the road to wait for you?
<b>People crash into each other all the time.</b> Who do they blame it on? How did it happen? Sometimes it's clear and sometimes it isn't. Crashes can be hit-and-runs; crashes can result in staying to help another person. 
<b>Sometimes you drive on autopilot.</b> You drive and drive and drive. You're automatically going to the store, the mall, the school. You forget where you're going and somehow end up there anyway. Society is so busy nowadays people are always looking to what they have to do next; they miss the inbetween, the process, the present. 

<b>punchline: ""and that's the point - the point, is to enjoy the drive. enjoy the ride.""</b>

But then I thought, hey.
<b>Life cannot be fit into a metaphor.</b>
Life is life - what're you going to do about it??"

It's so hilarious because Cornell's a big party school but then prelims come around and the guy who was drunk off his ass last night and trying to breakdance is like head buried in a book. Ah the nerds are emerging from all of us.
I'm at my favorite library place right now- it's called the Cocktail Lounge. Fitting, yes? Wow so half my keyboard stopped working right and was typing numbers just now. Anyway.
I stretched and leaned back in my chair, and accidentally carressed the head of the guy behind me...!!!!! Like, just now. Actually his hair felt pretty good but it was kind of an inconvenient way to feel it up. Seeing as I don't know him at all and was like ""Sorry!!"" in the middle of a silent library. Sweetness!!!

People start filing in, I am thinking about how ungodly hot the classroom is (I mean really now, you'd think they'd be considerate and give you a good cooling environment after you just walked uphill nonstop to get there). 
Some kid sits down next to me and starts running his mouth about squeaky chairs and how he had to get his homework and his chair squeaked.... I tell the cute kid in front that his is squeaky, he tests it, it isn't. That should have been a hint, but I just said it must be the one next to you - which was.
Eight minutes pass and I realize - who are these people?? 
""Hey guys!! Did you all just switch into this section?""
""Ummm. No? Wait, are you new?""
""Ummmm!???"" Perplexed look, I'm sure.
""What section are you?""
""I'm uhh... in room 112.""
""Ooh, this is 104!""
""Ahahahahaaa!! My bad...""
""Oh you still have two minutes no prob""
""Bye guys!!""

I feel like this should have been embarrassing but I really wasn't all that embarrassed.

So after our Freshman Writing Seminar (in which he is extremely skilled at acting completely invisible) Bryan and I go on an adventure! Everyday we cross the Thurston Bridge, which overlooks some of the plentiful gorges here at Cornell. Every day the message changes on the dry shore. The rocks are rearranged into different messages - yesterday was ""Be Nice."" We decide we need to rearrange it and make our mark!
(This was not our first time trying to find the way down to the gorge, it's a helluva far way down, but it was our first time actually finding it.) But we take the wrong fork in the trail and end up going a really roundabout way to get to the rock message. Slight problem: we're on the wrong side of the water. Now, it's shallow enough to wade across - but we find our own dry patch of rock to spell out a message in! Except it's only big enough for ""HI."" Good stuff- 
Our masterpiece done assembly style, we start back up, vowing to take the shorter trail up. Except the stairs just stop. So we end up climbing a loose dirt cliff, hugging trees along the way. Intense stuff - I wouldn't have made it in my flipflops if not for Bryan's help!! So we make it 3/4 of the way up and look right - and there's the actual TRAIL you're supposed to go up. One that doesn't suddenly disintegrate beneath you and send you falling back down to where you were ten minutes ago. Plus there's a random woman (probably a plant science major) coming up the same way!! We sit and stare at her until we realize she's coming straight towards us, taking photos of... botany along the way. ""This could get very awkward, very fast."" ""Should we run??"" ""How???"" 
""Okay,"" Bryan tells me, ""Act casual.""
Easy for HIM to say, HE has a tree to prop his leg against and do the casual stance - I'm digging my heels in the dirt trying not to fall on this crazy woman! Turns out she completely ignores us anyway, and we finish climbing to the top.
I look filthy, my once-black flipflops have chameleonized to brown, my pants are muddy.
Bryan looks like he just got out of class and has no trace of dirt on him. Curses!
Walk back to north campus laughing the whole way.

Today we both saw our masterpiece individually - I laughed hysterically, ""a tear of pride went down [his] cheek when [he] saw it.""

"event","So I have discovered that practicing no self control at a club fair is not the best idea in the world. In fact, I basically signed up for any club that was either
A) manned by a cute hunka loving,
or,
B) giving out free bubble tea at some point.
Also, I find that I am getting emails from things I DIDN'T EVEN SIGN UP FOR. Which is sick, right?? Some sort of underground email-list market??

There was a manga club meeting today. The email said there would also be a drawing tutorial - which, sounded incredibly interesting to moi. So I told a couple of my friends about it and they were like cool maybe we'll check it out. Eight o'clock comes around. (The manga thing was scheduled for 8-10). I'm down by the lake and somehow fall asleep on a stone bench watching the sunset like a hobo. (The hobo-like part was referring to the bench, although I'm sure hobos enjoy sunsets just as much as every other person.)
Ed calls me and asks if I'm going, I say groggily, ""?? UHhhh, I'm by the lake place. Maybe later.""
Then I decide I don't want to sleep and never wake up again (BECAUSE I WAS UP WATCHING THE LUNAR ECLIPSE LAST NIGHT YESSS!) so I headed towards the manga meeting. 

**Lunar Eclipse: I woke up at 5:10, run outside, the moon is 1/3 gone, and there are maybe twenty people in the middle of the courtyard watching it disappear. Good stuff. Ed took pictures, must be tagged in them!!**

Manga meeting.
So you know how I know dorky senior manga captain Eric? Well, I know him. So naturally I couldn't just LEAVE after seeing the situation and how much I DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN IT.
Allow me to describe. On third floor of a dining hall on north campus, there is a secluded conference room. In said secluded conference room sit approx. 10 plus or minus 2 nerdy glasses-wearing scary-looking manga dorks. And one old fat man. In the middle of the table are worn manga books and magazines (but only for a few seconds for these were snatched up). Room is silent. Nerds flip through manga. One nerd sits in corner playing some sort of portable video game with loud tinny background music.
I whip out cellphone and text two friends. 
COME NOW.
SAVE ME.
FAKE EMERGENCY.
I sit there agonized for another twenty minutes flipping hopelessly through FullMetal Alchemist Volume 2, a manga which I have already read.
Suddenly I get a reply:
Where??
YES! A SAVIOR! Ed comes. Apparently he tried the first conference room first and got a shock when it was locked, because he thought I was locked in with them! (Thank god this wasn't the case.) Also apparently he had already come to the beginning of the meeting and ran away because everyone looked scary but neglected to warn me not to go - in fact he had been thinking, oh I should ask her how it went if she goes when he received my text message. 
He passes by room doorway twice. None of nerds look up. I glare at him to do something.
""Margaret!! Sorry, are you guys busy? Emergency, Margaret, come!!""
RUN THE HELL OUTTA THERE, BOOK IT DOWN THE STAIRS, ACCROS THE COURTYARD, Maylian calls.
""Where are you??""
She had just gone up to save me as well, and was told by manga clubbers that her friend had just been fetched away, and was the emergency alright?
PHEW. NEVER AGAIN.

On another note, our floor had a ""dance party"" for this girl because it was her birthday, only I didn't know her at all but went anyway. (Free ice cream, popsicles, oh please I'm so there.) Dancing was sad, two guys did a bad rendition of I'M TOO SEXY FOR MY SHIRT. And did a grind sandwich on birthday girl,
No one was dancing except one white guy who was ""breakdancing"" but really just twitching and rolling pitifully on floor.
Anyway we got some dancing started and it was okay but then the RA from floor 3 below us (dirty bastards) told us off for shaking the floor.

ALSO: 
My stairwell was recently cleaned, THANK GOD, except, DAMN, the smell came back. You guys have no idea how bad this is. I hold my breath now, increasing lung capacity. Go Dickson!!"

"event","So I have this bout of homesickness, which, of course, can be easily distracted and displaced by a random hotguy sighting, hello hot guy in the library, but, then, it comes back because I am on livejournal and looking at your faces. (Most of them anyway.)
I just wanted to say I miss you guys and have realized how completely weird (I mean, unique) you are!! NOTE: I met another Amelia!!
Cornell is really beautiful and although the weather right now is freakishly hot (I feel gross before noon), it is undeniably gorges. Yes, gorges.
Don't worry, I won't be going gorge jumping. I do have SOME sense of self-preservation after all.
I signed up for Taekwondo for my PE class (I think I'll do kickboxing or fencing or archery next semester) and I tried to go to the introductory session yesterday, when we were supposed to get our uniforms. BUT, apparently I looked at the date wrong, BIG SURPRISE, and went a week earlier than I was supposed to. HOWEVER, I was not alone in my stupidity because some kid had come asking about it before me. Ha!
I hope you guys are well, good luck in college, I just wanted to tell you I'm still alive and not murdered by some crazy drunk.
(There were these hungover dorks in my Physics class that were really obnoxious, but I won't go into that.)

Today I was semi-angry because at 10 am there was BOOM BOOM BOOM right outside my window - no exaggeration, RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW - and it was the Cornell marching band!! Huzzah! NOT. They stayed for like an hour, and I had no choice but to get my ass out of bed.

Oh, I'll tell you about classes!
So Math is really full of crazyass intense engineers, who are.... crazyass intense engineers. I skipped the first calc class and went into this one (I'm still debating as to whether that was a mistake or not). 

So this class is full of <font color=red>handpoppers</font>. By handpoppers I mean the question is barely out of the teachers greying chapped lips before half a dozen hands have appeared out of nowhere and are madly waving themselves around. These are no ordinary handpoppers. These handpoppers are beastly cruel, and will turn on their own kind with no thought at all. ""NO!! THE ANSWER IS <I>NEGATIVE</I> TWO!!! (WHAT AN IDIOT!!)""
Dahhhummmmnnn. Chill out, handpoppas."

After all, what would a good joke be without the high-five or ""GIMME SOME SKIN!"" to follow through? What would a good INSULT be, for that matter!!!!? It's the cherry on top to the sundae, (and although I don't particularly like those fake cherries), it completes everything.
I suppose it's just demonstrative of everything mellowed out, everything kept ... down - like the silent movie theaters.
I took it upon myself to teach my cousin, my uncle, and my aunt the different techniques, making sure to emphasize the enthusiasm and different attitudes required (barely suppressed energy to nonchalant pure coolness). They thought it was so novel and new. Yes, yes, I am their savior. I bring the ray of sunshine and fun into their lives. This is true. I cannot deny it.
After showing them a few customed handshake examples, their homework is to come up with the start of their own personalized handshake (with me, of course).
Miss you guys! I don't know why, but I don't have handshakes for all of you, so we must treat this before we all part ways. 
Perhaps a communal handshake! (It should be translatable to 7 participants at a time, as well as just two.) 
Unusual, yes. 
Never been done before? Perhaps. 
So, ladies?"

"event","So today was my cousin's guitar recital, 
we got her flowers.
But turns out they were all rotten on the inside at the bottom and the water was all nasty and smelled like crap, which we found out when I put them on my lap. It spilled all over my shorts and I smelled like walking shit.
So I washed up and we got switched it for a different bouquet, but GUESS WHAT? It was nasty, too. Which we also found out later.
What's pretty on the outside might just smell like crap on the inside! Remember that, kids.

I have discovered that it kind of bothers me when foreign (actually I'm not so familiar with European just Chinese) people sing English songs, and it's obvious they have an accent. This girl was singing and she was alright but she just wouldn't pronounce the H in Heaven - it was just ""eeeaaaaavennn."" Pretty much bothered me.

I was trying to videotape my cousin but the old woman in front of me just kept bobbing back and forth, so I was like weaving and felt kind of athletic dodging her big ole head.
Also the two (other) old ladies behind us kept jabbering their mouths off in Taiwanese relatively loudly during the performance and I could tell my aunt was getting bothered. She even kind of turned her head around but only for a split second - ie not noticeable by the old biddies.
So I turned my head and gave them the smile glare - and satisfactorily they stopped!! It was gratifying to hear silence from behind. It took me a while to go through with it cause I was scared they would go all chinese punishment on me - maybe chinese water torture! - cause all the old chinese women in movies are scary.

Basically it was shocking the flowers had stinky water. I was going to think of something significant about this that related to other parts of life but am not able to apply my brain in such ways at the moment."

"event","So I just felt this was momentous enough or just simply delicious enough to deserve another post. 
I got my hair cut today.
No, that was not the news.
Really it's not just news, you know me, it's mancandy. Boycandy.
So in Taiwan, when you get ""shampooed,"" you REALLY get ""shampooed.""
This guy was INCREDIBLY CUTE!!! It was fate that I got the cute young one and the guy I was with got the old balding one. Way to go, fate!
So first he ties the apron around me, which is alltogether a completely pleasurable experience. Okay, what can I say? I'm DEPRIVED. 
Anyway I'm lying there and he's massaging the hell out of my head, while I get to stare up at him. But you know whaT? After a while I can't even concentrate on his face because HIS HANDS ARE MAGIC. NO JOKE. ORGASMIC SHAMPOOING GOING ON UP IN HERE. Then he does this thing with his fingers massaging the hairline and up and down the back of my neck, and I just about DIE.
In the beginning he asked me if the water was too hot and I couldn't hear him (otherwise engaged), and I kept going ""What?"" Later he was just smiling and asked me if I was from out of Taiwan. Yes, yes.
But back to my point, magic hands. I melted. MELTED.
And the haircut, I don't know. It's okay, maybe. Can't really decide, as usual. 
Next time I'm just going in for a shampoo. Please be unable to find other better work, Mr. Shampoo Boy.

He had longish messy hair, pretty tall, beige crocs. Suddenly... crocs aren't so fugly anymore."

"event","I am now graduated. 
Well, I've been graduated for approximately 6 days, to be a bit more exact, but not so much that I can't look myself in the mirror without thinking ""I can't believe you just calculated that.""
The action itself, graduating, took (again) approximately one hour, and was surprisingly easy. Other than the forever horrifying danger that my right foot might fall asleep, and the recurring nightmare that I might trip in my Payless heels walking across the stage towards or with my diploma, and our apparent inability to sit in our properly assigned seats, graduation came and went: smooth sailing.
The speeches were unmemorable, dry, annoying, and made the experience all the more - graduation.
You may argue with me on critique of speeches, but this is my journal and I'm writing whatever the hell I want.
Now that I am officially disrolled from Greenhills, and perhaps an ""alumni,"" how does it feel? It feels... like I'm going to Cornell.
I've been keeping myself pretty busy, and frankly haven't really had the bored what-the-hell-should-I-do down time to think about it. I even had to semi-force myself to write this entry before its purpose or meaning got too inconsequential, or just out of date. I use the word ""semi-force"" because to force is simply not the right word.
I mean, you can say you force yourself to do something, but does that really make sense? Forcing in itself seems to suggest the forcee is unwilling to do whatever it is they are being forced to do. But human nature does not allow ourselves to force ourselves to do things we don't want to do. It just does not work. Besides, if <i>you</i> are the one forcing yourself, doesn't that mean that <i>you</i> want to be doing whatever it is you're ""forcing"" yourself to do, but just don't want to admit it? Or you think you should be doing it, but you might not ""want"" to in the sense that you ""enjoy"" it? All these words have definitions that teeter and flash in their vagueness and subjectivity to relativity.
But as that surprisingly alright semi-new Fallout Boy song says, ""but I digress.""
Being graduated from high school is like getting up from a seat. A nice, cushy, sofa seat. You see, you sat in it way back in ninth grade, but you couldn't decide whether you liked how it felt or not. You sat in it, moved your butt around, and thought about its comfortableness. You look around and try to decide whether or not you should let shyness and awkwardness overtake you or not. 
Then tenth grade came along and you got caught up in conversation, forgetting about the pending 1-10 comfortableness rating of said sofa chair. You think you have it just about figured out - after all, you <i>have</i> found where the small lever is that makes it recline, and your feet feel pretty good all propped up. 
On went junior year, during which you start to notice that your butt is getting just a tad overheated from sitting in the same place too long. You fill out college applications with a little foresight but only because you have been told (or think you have had) experience where overheated butts become unbearably uncomfortable. Then applications start to wear on you. You spill your drink.
Next comes senior year, where you might lift a leg up on that sofa chair and sit on it for a different position or two. The new height gives you a different outlook, and suddenly you're not so concerned about keeping that sofa chair nice and white. No, your shoe is digging into the once immaculate (yet obviously unlived in) white leather. You are making your mark. A nice, black, brown, dirty, sneaker-shaped mark. Homework? What's that?
Graduation comes and you become aware of the fact that your leg muscles have become mushy from years of disuse. You watch as the people in front of you in silly green tasseled hats and broad-shouldered green gowns march off to shake hands and get diplomas. You hear their names being called. Alphabetically, getting closer and closer to your own. When it comes you realize it's you. That's me. 
And there it is. The standing. You stand and you go and shake the hands of one person you've never seen prior to the ceremony, one you wish you'd never seen prior to the ceremony, and another who you think almost nothing negative of at all.
You receive that piece of paper nicely encased in that leather booklet with gold lettering on front, you nonchalantly hook it in one hand and concentrate on your shoes. You sit back down but you know it's just for a moment. Because in no time at all, a matter of minutes or months really, you'll be up again.
You'll be up and you'll be finding another seat. One made of completely different material, different stuffing, different mold. 
College awaits.
It's giving you bedroom eyes and that seductive little pat on the part of the seat where your butt goes. 
Hey, you. Come hither.
Make it wait a little. Play hard to get. Take you own sweet time walking over. Go to some movies, some parties, some places. Cherish those steps that separate you and your new seat. Because that is summer 2007."

"event","So I come home from my recital and what do you know, our power's out.
I glance at my cellphone. Zero bars, as usual. If negative bars existed, I would be ahead of the game.
What to do?? This may seem a silly question, but consider it further. I find it hard to find things to do when the <i>power is on</i>. Now that it's off, so many things are crossed off the list, all of which are my major pasttimes, no matter how sad it may be: instant messenger, facebook, internet in general, and the all powerful - tv.
Without so many lights and windows to blink at me, or commercials to shake women's asses in my face, (maybe I'm referring to mtv, who knows), I found myself rather... freed. I took advantage of the waning light and drew a picture, even. It's rather nice, if I say so myself.
Then night came. And with it, darkness. 
When I came across my iPod, sitting on my blackened desk, I rejoiced silently. HELL YES! MUSIC! As I popped the shitty white earphones in my ears, I took a walk around the house. Sat on a couch. Walked around. Lied down on my bed. 
Overall, it was am emo experience. Listening to music in the dark provoked many thoughts. About what, I don't remember. It was like an emo dream. Of sorts.
Then I began to get fidgety, for I was at a loss for what to do and hell if I could sleep that early.
Just as I was about to get desperate and host a flashlight-illuminated self-portrait session, beep beep beep! The house came back to life. 
I jumped to my computer and hit the on button. Ahhh, the whirring of machines."

"event","Today I woke up incredibly hungry; and with no motivation whatsoever to eat anything existing in my refrigerator. Solution? Drive to the Chinese Market and buy some damn peanuts.
On my way, I encountered a light turning yellow. Upon a couple seconds of intense deliberation, I decided to slow to a stop. After all, who needs another ticket? Not I.
As I sat there, staring sideways up at the yellow traffic light, I wondered to what extent people might wait for that light to turn green. What if the traffic lighting system went haywire and that particular traffic light simply remained red for hours at a time? How long would it take for said person to simply run the red light? When would they decide that society's rules are guidelines? 

How many of us just sit there, waiting for the light to turn green?

But overthrowing the system altogether doesn't necessarily yield satisfactory results. Running the light and getting a ticket would simply put you back within the system and further hinder any future action. Working within the system, to perhaps, take a right turn and meander your way through the red light, might serve you better. 
But once you understand the workings of the system you need to be able to go beyond just comprehension. Then you must decide what exactly to do with that red light. 
It wavers and bends before our eyes. Mocking? Perhaps. As we blink and widen our eyes the light gets bigger and smaller and bigger again. Hit the target."

"event","The most popular word of today: ""like.""
Admit it. There's no shame. We all use it. We all are like, hooked on like.
So what's with this modern day obsession? Why can't we just be normal and use ""um,"" ""uh,"" or some other nonmeaningful monosyllabic moronic sounding grunt?
Because ""like"" is not in itself meaningless. No, like is a word. And like many other words, it has a meaning. To be like something is to remind us of that something. To have that something's essence. And what is essence? It is subjective. The quintessence is represented in our real world in copies of the original ideas, and therefore, to be like, is all in the perception of that particular person. To be the essence, or not to be.
People are not skilled at talking. Most people need written notecards or planned speeches to talk ""flawlessly."" I define flawless here as without superfluous interjections. We need time to work our brain around what exactly we want to say; and oftentimes we don't even know what that is. Even if we do, we hesitate and simulate before we come right out and say it. Therefore, the essence is revised many times over before it comes out our mouths. So although speech may be the purest form of expression, thought is expression in its spontaneous state. Writing is a representation of speech.
We use like as a buffer, a sort of gasoline that fuels us around the nooks and corners that lead us to what we mean - or maybe just what we say. Who says exactly what they mean, after all?
To say things exactly as we mean them, exactly as we think them, is something rarely done. Therefore whatever comes out our mouths is simply ""like"" whatever quintessence exists, whatever the original pure form was. 
I am like, so damn smart."

"event","<b>Today was the Day of Silence.</b>
Staying silent all day (more or less; well, a little less - I did mess up a couple times ""Thanks,"" ""I think I just exposed most of my photo paper,"" and ""Whoa!"") was kind of like having a permanent glass bubble around me at all times. Being mute created a dichotomy between the bustling world of Greenhills and I; at times my day was almost surreal. Try as I might to get my meaning across the barrier, sometimes it just wasn't good enough. 
I gestured, I jumped, I mouthed, I learned 80% of the Greenhills population I come in contact with is completely and totally lost at interpreting charades. 
The separation was kind of enlightening. When you aren't participating in the world through speech, you give yourself space to further dedicate time to other pasttimes - such as observing society. Being a bystander truly puts things in perspective; and can make it all the harder to join in again, once you understand - or perhaps only think you understand - how you will be received.

On the college note, I madly gestured to Mr. T that I would go meet with him tomorrow (who knows if he actually got what I was trying to convey). I am still completely at a loss. Decisions, decisions. I'm not normally very good at making them in a timely fashion; I like to keep my options open until the very last minute. And this is probably the most important decision of my life yet. 
Usually I try to picture myself in each different decision, and imagine if I would have regrets or not. If I can't even picture myself in the situation, it's obvious it's not the right choice. But now, I see myself at all these colleges. Three different me's: Margaret1, Margaret2, and Margaret3. 

<b>Margaret1</b> has grown fond of coffee and can't live without her daily mango smoothie. She practically lives in the WashU Architecture Studio at Givens and catches sleep whenever she can. Her fingers are always covered in some sort of art gunk, whether it be charcoal, glue, sawdust, or blood from cuts. Although the work is fickle and the bristol board never stays where she wants it, she is always satisfied when the finished masterpiece is revealed. Plus there are cute guys in studio in wee hours of the morning. 
<b>Margaret2</b> has no time for contacts. She wears glasses and every day is a battle between her (weapons: calculator, pencil, and gigantic eraser) versus the next physics set (danger level: 10.4). She keeps telling herself she really needs to learn that thing called time management, and find time to get to the gym after gaining weight from the delicious Cornell food. Plus she yearns for fun, but is sacrificing some of this in order to be the best she can be and meet her challenges. She works like a dog to satisfy all her interests, but they are, as a result, satiated to the max.
<b>Margaret3</b> is close to home but likes to pretend she isn't. She often visits her apartment friend so that her friend can have something new to eat besides burnt pancakes and overcooked omelettes. She holds poker night at her dorm every week or so; her high school friends have become lifetime friends. 

<b>Margaret</b> is having trouble deciding which Margaret she wants to become by September of this year."

As soon as my foot hits the top stair, their psychic xray vision reaches my face and suddenly I am bombarded with demands to TAKE OFF YOUR CONTACTS! I'm not talking stink bombs, either. I'm talking big-time atom bombs that leaves years worth of unstable dangerous radiation in Japan level bombardment. Now I understand that some (dumbass vain) girls in Taiwan were trying to take their contacts off when their eyes were too dry, and ended up scraping off the surface of their eyes. I understand that some of them wore contacts that made their pupils larger in the pursuit of beauty, trading off for oxygen getting to their eye. They lost at least half their eyesight through their lack of foresight. However, I am still indignant when I am practically attacked for someone else's stupidity. It's good to be informed. To know the dangers of the situations. But just because the little black box or big grey paper has a few cautionary things to say doesn't mean that your life thus merits major conflict over eyes that aren't even dry, an alternative spring break that might cause a nail to puncture your skin and give you a disease and make you die, a trip to europe that may end up in you getting on a subway and getting blown to bits. 
I don't want to sound ungrateful here. Which is probably why I am, once again, venting to my livejournal. But urgency can be expressed in other ways, alternative to raising the voice several decibels above humanly possible, pounding blood pressure, and eventual deafness to anything reasonable at all. Urgency also doesn't mean that you forget to say ""Hello, how was your day?"" It doesn't mean that one party stays mad, madd, and madder upstairs, while the other goes downstairs to drop a couple tears on her bed. 
I'd rather just wear glasses.
The overprotectiveness is touching? I know it shows they care. I know they must have seen it somewhere in the news, and worried about it for an unhealthy amount of time (for my parents anyway), then burst the dam to explode the built up words on - me. Because that's what they do. 
My results are inconclusive. This is how they are, this is how I'm not. That is what it is. By the time I finish this entry I will have accepted it and moved on, perhaps grooving to my newly downloaded ""So Fresh and So Clean (Clean);"" they will still be upstairs with my unsigned permission slip, emotions coursing through their bodies. Perhaps another half hour later I will make my slow way up the stairs once more, 
and s(m)ooth(e) things over.

"event","Today was bad. Well. To avoid using the word ""bad,"" let me just say it was ""not good."" Sassurean negation - Randy would be proud, yes?
Since I feel bad venting too much to actual people, I can just spill any stress out to this bright white screen. I have Forensics Districts tomorrow, and I don't feel too confident. I have tons of Chemistry to do, and I don't want to do it. I have photos to take, and I don't have film. I have Chinese to do, and I don't know how to go about doing it. I have a pimple, and I don't care. 
Now for the answers: I'll just practice my gestures to make them more firm for Districts tomorrow. I will do Chemistry. I will borrow my dad's digital camera. I will ask my mom how to do Chinese. I will... pop it.
As for college, everyone around me is building up the anticipation for the big decisions. Sometimes I hope I get in; sometimes I hope I don't so my decision will be easier.
Oh, did I mention I am catching a cold? (God I feel like I'm complaining too much even when no one's suffering these words.) 
I got home and decided to do what I do when I catch a cold in warm weather: wash and wax my car. Somehow it doesn't make me dizzy even when it should. Perhaps it's because I can splash water on my face anytime to get myself back. Anyway, my reasoning is, it makes me feel better - it sweats out the germs. My bedroom's too cold for a disease, anyway. Some sun is good. 
As I was bounding down to my room to retrieve my keys, I jumped down each half flight of stairs. And on the last one, I got too enthusiastic and banged my head on the ceiling beam. Laughing? This is not the first time this has happened. First let me say for the record that I even left a mark on the wood where my head banged it; I also retained a slight bump with minimal bleeding. Which, I just realized, did not prevent me from jumping down the stairs once again two minutes ago. (Although this time, I thankfully did not hit my head.)
The first time was at school, jumping down the stairs to the forum - that time it was against the metal beam, which was... painful. Of course right afterwards I landed as if nothing had happened, and quickly checked the premises as well as I could with the throbbing pain through my head to make sure no one had seen me. Embarrassing.
There must be a ceiling beam magnet embedded in my frontal lobe."

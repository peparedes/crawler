"event","Early to bed, early to rise. It think there is something in this principle. Being the first one awake in the dorm has it's advantages. For example, I now have proof that the amount of time between Crabbe and Goyle's snores increase when they are closer to consciousness. Such information could prove to be useful in a variety of situations. One never knows when they might have to sneak a pumpkin pasty past them in their sleep. Imagine the two awaking to the scent, suddenly chomping around with sleep-encrusted eyes. So very dangerous. In fact, it is starting to sound more like one of Potter's tournament events.  

Millicent is still going on about Tracey following me. I think she is trying to throw me off her trail. However, Millicent happens to have the agility of an elephant and I am not easily deterred. I know you are trying to mess with me Millicent. It is what you do best. Do go use your talents on someone more appropriate. I hear the resident madman has returned, as well his lady. Imagine the fun you could have."

"event","The weekend was rather irritating. I'm not sure what was more annoying, the owls or Millicent's rendition of them. Though I gladly report she did a better job than the owls, she does it more often. Little history was actually learned from the event. I would have thought the people of Hogsmeade would want to pass on such knowledge to future generations especially since the celebration only happens every 13 years. Instead I think I've actually come away from the event with less knowledge of the town than before, having obliviated certain scenes from my memory. 

Though on the upside, the event seemed to have satisfied the younger students enough that they are actually doing their studies as opposed to giving me a migraine."

"event","I am grateful for the extra breathing room about the castle and am enjoying the extra space in the common room. Or as much as can be allowed with Crabbe and Goyle still around. Not to say I do not welcome those who are away, back here. The castle does look dreadfully empty. I believe I have grown accustomed to the rising number of students, or learned to better deal with it, so that it seems strange to see the halls less crowded. Draco is glowing now that Nyssa is away. He talked of having a special tryout for all the Durmstrang girls that might want to play this week. He doubts any will have interest enough to show up. Quidditch, after all, is more important than some things. I was disappointed to see the Gryffindors scrape another victory last weekend. Though it will make it all the more satisfying to see them get crushed later. 

Some have seemed to have taken it upon themselves to fill the more annoying void of the absent younger years. A trip to Hogsmeade sounds more than necessary. Perhaps allowing some of the students still here to become uncaged will curve their tendency to act beneath them."

"event","It seems someone has started harassing the female population on this device. I had to witness it for myself. Yes, I am quite bored, even now that I am here. It appears that whoever is doing the harassing has a weak backbone indeed, which makes for poor entertainment. It was in poor taste to pick on Slytherin girls, as they are most resourceful when it comes to payback. Things could grow interesting, so I suppose I will have to stay to witness the outcome at least. Anything in front of my eyes at the moment is better than what I could see if I were looking around right now. 

Millicent has drawn a scar upon her forehead and has taken to staring at everyone for lengthy periods of time while invading their personal space. Apparently she believes if we all complain about Potter enough Professor Snape will finish him off. She is inches from my face as I type this; most unpleasent. Pansy, be a dear and get her to stop, or give her a makeover. Either will suffice."

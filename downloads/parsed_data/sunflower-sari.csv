Due to events with me not being able to have my privacy anymore to speak my mind without getting negatively back lashed from an ex-boyfriend about what I was posting in my journal (when I should have the right to post what I feel); I made this journal Friends Only.

<center><font size=""5""><b> FRIENDS ONLY</b></font></center>

This journal is my place to escape and write about what's going on in my mind, what I feel or is going on around me.

I talk a lot about personal things going on in my life and there are just some things I don't want everyone to see anymore.

However; I love making new friends. Feel free to add me, but please tell me if you do add me.

Just make sure before you ask to be added we have some interests in common - otherwise you might find my journal very uninteresting.

Leave me a comment if you wish to be added. <br>"

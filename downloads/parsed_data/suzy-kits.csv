"event","Whoa, it's been like...a bazillion years since I've updated. I guess time really does fly, although I don't really think it much matters if you're having fun or not. I can't believe how busy I've been lately. Well, perhaps I've not been overly busy, but damn, when you do something besides work and sleep it sure seems like you are! I've been working a lot of overtime lately. Working at a small business is hard work! Imagine that. I've also started walking 2-3 miles a day. My sister is training for a marathon, so I figured that I'd train right along with her. Let's see how long that lasts. =P I'm super tired now, so I think I'll just step away from the computer. P.S. I miss Sara more than Maxie does. :)

"event","Well, Here I am! I'm finally posting a new journal. Been a little busy with work and stuff lately....well and a little lazy and maybe just a tad bit depressed.....okay hardly busy with work and stuff...quite lazy and very depressed. But all's well that end's well. I'm feeling better now even though today was a close one. My sister/boss was in a weird mood and would snap at me...then be completely normal again. Not good for the self esteem, that. It almost made me feel like I could do nothing right...Almost. I got over that because I was stoked to be going out with Yvette for the first time in, literally, months. She's one of my closest friends and knows just about everything about me. I've been avoiding her for these long months...actually way longer than that because I just couldn't deal with trying to be a friend as well as all the stuff I had going on with work and my family. I'm not good under stress and knew I couldn't be a good friend. Now I'm completely happy to say that I'm completely ready to be a good friend. I'm thrilled. Tonight was great fun. I didn't get to talk to Darnell like I'd like to, but I did talk about him....alot. It was nice to have someone to gossip with and chit chat. And her boyfriend Mark is really good for her. He's a good guy and she deserves someone like that in her life. All in all it was a fun evening. I'm glad I went out with them :) Even if the Chinese restaurant we went to was a little weird. =P"

"event","It's been a few days, so I thought I'd do a short post. Day started out quite well, I was alone at the office until 11:00, so I didn't have to worry about anyone giving me a hard time, or more work to do for that matter. I was even happy that I had gotten to talk to Darnell this morning and I had a jumbo size coffee. We're talking 32oz. Life was good. I managed to get through the day and actually get a lot done. Sometimes the day flies so fast that I feel as if I've accomplished little, but today I know I got a lot done. Stopped by the grocery store and bought a 6 pack of Diet Dr. Pepper and a tube of conditioner and got myself home. I spent the time until my mom got home reading a book because I didn't find anything I wanted at Barnes and Noble. I was sitting there chatting with my mom about bills...and it hit me. I'm never going to go back to school. Suddenly I felt as if the bottom dropped out of my stomach..and my heart. It seems that no matter how much I work, how much I plan and try I just can't get ahead enough to go back to school. If you don't know already, I owe the last college I went to $1,500. I can't get my transcripts released until I pay it back. In hindsight, even if I did miraculously pay back the money and transfer to another school...I can't pay for it. I make too much to qualify for loans and grants..yet not enough to pay for school..It's just not fair. I guess I should stop whining about it and try to do something, but I don't know what. It's so hard...not just to do it, but to remain upbeat and positive. I don't know how many of you have ever done it, but I've been working two jobs for the last two years...to the day today..And working 7 days a week sucks..All I have to say is: I'm really glad I have no alcohol."

I'm glad too because Sara posted and I'm really stoked to see that she's doing well. Down here in lone-star land things are going pretty well. I can't say that much interesting has been happening, hence the lack of journal entries on my part...of course that could also be laziness... Nevar! Well, now that we've gotten that all cleared up....I have absolutely nothing to say. How sad. Oh yeah, I trimmed my hair because I wanted to copy Maxie. Actually it was just annoying me. Mine's not as cute as hers though. Darnell and I have been having a few problems. I guess that comes from two extremely stubborn people trying to impose their will on one another....or maybe I'm just an uber bitch. I think I'll put my money on the latter. But I'm not a gambling woman. Things are better now since we've had a couple heart-to-hearts. I think we have both come to terms with the concept of ""compromise"" heaven forbid. So, yeah, I think that's enough nonsense for now."

Anyway, I've not been up to anything much 'cept work for the past few days. I went to my friend Alek's house last night and he has the cutest hedgehog. It's name is Pryor. We watched Monty Python's Meaning of Life. I had no idea it was so damn funny. And you get to see John Cleese's bum. :) Anyway, I bought these really cute shoes at the mall when I went on my shopping spree, but they hurt my feet! I hate that. I hope I break them in soon. Anyway, I really don't have much to say since it's been a boring few days. I'll try to get depressed or stoned or drunk or something so I have more to write about next time. Until then, peace, love and sex: lots and lots of it."

"event","Yes, yes, I know I've not been around lately. Sorry! I've been just a bit busy, shopping makes me tired! I had a wedding to go to today, so of course, I had to go shopping. It was hell. After every shoe store in the mall and about 2 miles of walking around, I was ready to call it quits. Then my sister and I decided to exchange the dresses we had bought so, we had to go and do it all over again. To top it off, I have a pinched nerve in my back. That hurts like hell. At times it can be hard to even move, let alone walk or sit upright. On Friday, my sister got me an appointment to have a massage. Heaven. Pure and simple. Awesome. Sublime. I could go on forever. Go get a massage ASAP! Anyway, pain and shopping is pretty much all I've been up to lately. Aside from the fighting with the boyfriend. That always sucks, but somehow we manage to get past it and all is good with the world again. I see that Sara and yes, even Maxie have updated their journals so it's my turn. Tonight we all went out to wish Sara goodbye and I'm sad. We had a great time. Good food and good company equal fun time for all, but it was overshadowed by the knowledge that this is the last time it'll happen. Now that I look back on it, we should have done more together outside of work, but individual lives seem to just get in the way. Sara, Good luck and take care. Always remember that I love you and I'm here for you. However, I don't like your quizzes. to follow is just exactly why =P

Hope that worked. If it didn't, it's Power Rangers the Movie. Now it's time to shoot myself. =P It seems though that I'm a lost soul too. Toldja we have kindred spirits.

You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what
that can always mean, because it can be defined
in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were
the spirits of passed away people who are
neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the
earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing
when you expect it least. So hence, if you have
a Lost Soul, then you are probably very
insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box,
you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont
know your place. You seemingly dont have a
place in society or an interest. You are a very
capricious person, and are confused and
frustrated about where you belong. You crave
for the sense and feeling of home-but have not
obtained it yet.

"event","Hey Sara! Thanks for cleaning up, it looks better now than it did before. :D Anyway, after rolling out of bed on time..yes, the end is nigh, I actually tried to do something with my hair. Funny how Sara mentioned hair, mine sucks. I'll trade her any day. For some reason, the straightening iron didn't work...imagine that. Anyway, my hair ended up looking like some greasy punk kid's hair. Let me tell you, for an office job, that's not the look one shoots for. Anyway, besides that, morning was quite good. Had my coffee and muffin and hit the office. My sister's dog was there already and so, I got to clean up dog puke twice. Poor thing, she's getting old, so I can't be too upset by it ^_^. Then I get a call from mom saying that the garage is leaking water. Needless to say that after going back home, moving stuff out of the way of the water, going back to work, getting called by the plumber, going back to the house, the plumber not having the right part and needing to go across town for it, going back to the office, THEN taking my lunch break and going back home to let the plumber in so he could do his 3 minute repair....I just lost my train of though. Oh well, no loss. Then I went shopping! I found the most bitchin' pink belt and matching pink bracelet. I'm so happy. Of course, I didn't find a dress for the wedding that I needed to find...go figure. But I did notice that all the clothes in Banana Republic are made for girls with no titties, and all the clothes in Lane Bryant are made for girls with too much tittie. I fall into neither category, so it's off to Walmart with me! I'm gonna go workout now, Ciao."

"event","Well, here it is, almost 9 hours later and my day hasn't improved. I'm not going to sit here and complain, but damn, sometimes I just wish I could make it all go away. Wouldn't life be grand if family truly gave unconditional love, if we could live happily surrounded by friends and have lots and lots of sex? Seriously though, sometimes I wonder why exactly life has to be so rough. Not just physically, though you do have to admit even from that first day, it's tough. Sliding out of a hole the size of a lemon can't be fun, and that's just the beginning. Emotionally it's hard too. I watch my family all try to deal with their emotions. They have had so many hurts over the years, so many things to rip them apart, and I have to say that none of them are faring well in the mental stability department. Not that any of them are crazy. They just have issues and I'm not too sure if they can resolve them. It's kinda weird. Everyone in my family considers me to have the least issues. It's always amusing to be sitting there being told how I don't have problems and I'm stronger than that, etc. I'd truly like to know how anyone knows. Especially since they rarely bother to try to find out what's going on in my mind. Earlier, I was bitching because my mom refused to leave my room when I told her too. I suppose, upon retrospection, that she was just trying to make an effort to understand and help me. I pushed her away. I know that all this familial unrest is tough on her. Today, she penned four letters, one each to my sibling, saying how sorry she was that she came across as unloving. How she tried to show how much she loved them, but she was scared of being rejected so she pushed them away. Why do people do that? I have to say that I'm guilty of exactly the same thing. When I'm upset, I push people away. But to add insult to injury, I get angry about it. I need to work on that. You catch far more flies with honey than with vinegar, and I'm tired of being a lonely fly. Even when I'm sitting at the computer chatting with four or five people at a time, I feel lonely. Not Alone, but lonely because I know, deep down, that eventually I'll push them all away. Can we say ""masochistic""? I have had some wonderful friends in my lifetime. Yvette for one. She's a very wonderful, giving, kind, generous person. I love her so much. I've pushed her away. I'm too tainted and negative to be a good friend to her. Alek. He's been the best friend I've ever had. I can tell him anything...but I don't. I'd trust him with my life, but I can't trust him with my demons. Mikey. He's never been anything but supportive and loving. Why can't I just bring myself to call him? Those are just a few, but there are many more. I haven't figured out if I'm just cold or if I'm just scared. Probably a little of both. Perhaps it's my coldness or callousness that caused the problem with my sister today. Perhaps it's her problem and not mine. How does one figure it out? Does one really want to? I hope I cheer up soon because it's not so fun to jot down my thoughts when they're gloomy like this. Hope I have something better to say at next post."

"event","Well, here is my first post of the day. Why is it that family thinks it's okay to be cryptic first thing in the morning? Or even more than that, bitchy? My mom comes in and wakes me up because my sister wants me to call her. Fine. That's not a big deal. Then she tells me that she's not going to my sister's place for a belated 4th of July picnic. Yay. She's sick and she doesn't want to go. Fair enough. I call my sister and am talking to her, and she had no idea that my mom wasn't going to go. So, that doesn't go over well. Then I make the mistake in saying, ""why don't you guys just have it?"" Wow, let's sit back and watch the fireworks for that one. She hung up on me. Then she called back and started yelling at me. You know what? I DID want to go, but after that, wild horses couldn't drag me out there. Now, my entire family is pissed off at me, and you know what? I don't give a damn. I'm tired of all this. At this very moment, my mom's in here pissing and moaning about it. I don't know what I should do, I don't know where I should go. I just want to be left alone, and I can't even have that, because my family thinks it's all good just waltz right in my room, and ""go away"" isn't enough to get rid of them. Anyways, with any hope my day will improve. As it stands, I may end up getting in my car and driving until I'm the hell out of Texas."

"event","Yes, yes. I know this will make four times in one evening. Perhaps it's just the novelty of a new toy, or perhaps it just feels good to have a place to record my feelings. I think tonight was a very mood-swingy night. I started off slightly bummed from work, mellowed a bit from talking to Darny and some other friends, became bouncy when I did the quizzes from Sara's page, and now I feel blah. Sometimes I feel like I just can't do a damn thing right. Like it's my fault the lives of my family and friends are so fucked up, or at the very least that I haven't done enough to remedy that. Darny said something tonight that hurt my feelings, but could I be normal about it and just tell him? No, of course not, that makes too much sense. I got angry and snapped back at him. Brilliant, huh? Anyway, I apologized, but I don't think he understood quite how sincere I was. Doesn't matter. I know that I was sincere. I wish that I was a stronger person. I like to think that my friends can come to me for a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen, or just to have some sense knocked into them. But if that's so, why does it hurt so much when one of them does? It's not that I mind it, or it bothers me to listen...I encourage them to. Everyone needs an extra ear sometimes..But I feel their pain. And I want to take it away from them, cry for them. Like I'm doing now as I'm writing this. How lame, I'm sure no one wants to know about my lack of control over my tear-ducts. Anyway, I know that I can't right all the wrongs in this world, nor can I dry all the tears, but I'll keep trying. I'll keep crying... and this is supposed to be making me feel better...or something. I hope it works even though the results aren't too apparent right now. I guess I'm done for the moment, sitting here whining isn't going to help me. Although it IS nice to have a reason to try to focus all my thoughts. So I guess some good has come from this. This is attempt number two to post this, I hope my internet connection doesn't crash this time. =P"

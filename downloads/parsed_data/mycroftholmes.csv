"event","<lj-cut text=""in which I respond to the ranting about ME3"">

I thoroughly enjoyed the Mass Effect series, including ME3. While I wasn't happy with every aspect, it is akin to being frustrated that there's some gunk and a few tears on a $100 bill you just found laying in the gutter.

The ending of ME3 was not what I expected.

Let me pause for a moment to point out ""not what I expected"" is not and should not be a criticism. Those who complain when things aren't what they expect must be terribly dull people.

The ending of ME3 isn't what I'd have written. Who the fuck am I, Robert Heinlein? Joss Wheadon? William Gibson? I'm sure anything I'd have written would have sounded awesome to me, and it'd wind up having a million plot holes and be generally unsatisfactory to The Voice Of The Interwebs.

***SPOILERS**** The ending of ME3 was a very Mass-Effect style situation: three choices, none of them desirable, all with consequences. The Synthesis ending is the heroic choice, sacrificing ones self for peace. I felt a real sense of closure. I held a thin hope that maybe, just maybe there was a way for us to survive, but I'd said goodbye to the characters. All their stories are concluded well. They all have arcs with satisfying conclusions. And the explanation the Star Child gives was an answer. Perhaps not the best writing ever, but it was an answer. ...and they still left things open for debate - was he indoctrinated? I like that. ***Spoilers***

The fan-rage at the ending reminds me a lot of the madness that followed the final episode of the cult Anime series Neon Genesis: Evangelion. It was vague as hell. Rabid fans stormed the production studio's offices. Vague the ending was, but it wrapped up the characters, especially the protagonist, and his melancholy arc finally came to a happy conclusion. The first time I watched it, I was also confused as hell but I felt good. I didn't understand why people were so upset. Of course, the writer/director ultimately gave in to fan pressure (and the prospect of profit) and made a film that was far more explicit about the events of the ending. Except this time, the ending was far more bleak - a sort of final 'fuck you' from the writer to those who refused to accept the ending as he'd written it.


[[[...responding to ""Five reasons why the ME3 detractors are right"" article]]]
I've read that and I disagree with most of it - particularly the concept that your choices are discarded / meaningless. The choices you make in ME1 and ME2 directly affect who lives and dies in ME3, how much support you get from various factions, and the amount of choice you have at the end of the game. While they may not be reflected in the ending cinematic, but they're the basis of two thirds of the entire ME3 storyline for heaven's sake.

I also disagree with the idea that the ending makes no sense. The reapers harvest organic civilizations, preserving their racial memory in the form of living ships. It's still horrifyingly genocidal, but the logic of this superbeing AI is such that ""at least this way civilizations are preserved at the height of their progress before falling into chaos resulting from synthetic rebellion."" It is not the Xibit ""sup dawg, i heard u don't like being killed by synthetics so I'll kill you with synthetics every 50k years"" image. Is it the best writing Bioware's done? Certainly not, but it isn't nonsensical.

The mass relay plothole: in ME1 it's stated that if a mass relay is destroyed, the explosion would destroy the entire solar system it services. You have me there. But we are talking about a major Deus Ex Machina with the crucible / Star Child thing, so it's hardly a leap to think that the intelligence that created the mass relays would be able to destroy them in a way that doesn't blow up solar systems. It also makes sense that anything capable of destroying all reapers would also destroy the Citadel and the Mass Relays considering that they were made by the same race and use the same technology.

The other big plothole mentioned - how did your crew get back on the Normandy? Yeah, that was confusing. A quick cutscene between the Illusive Man's death and the Star Child sequence would have resolved that well.

A lack of thematic continuity? I can't see how someone can argue that unless they did not have the Synthesis option at the end of the game. It's the ultimate conclusion of the ideas of unity and coexistence between synthetics and organics that carries through from ME1. And of course that ending concludes with Joker and EDI walking out of the Normandy like the Adam and Eve of a new world.

Again, I am not suggesting that the ending is great. It's all right. Could have been better. Heck, a simple series of scenes on the different homeworlds that reflected some impact of your choices would have made a big difference in the impact of the ending (even if that sounds disturbingly like the special edition of RoTJ.)

My point is that the objections are over the top. ""I'll never buy another Bioware game!"" ""This will ruin BioWare forever!"" Seriously? This sounds like the ranting of a ten year old girl who didn't get a pony for her birthday. The ME3 ending is NOT to Mass Effect what the prequals were to the OT. People need to calm their shit down.


[[[....more replying, in this case, to an accusation that clearly I did not read the thread of rage prior to replying and thus did not understand why They Were Right.]]]

I read the whole thread before replying.

I don't know what people were expecting with ME3. Bioware would have had to make two completely separate games in order to negate the ""IF Wrex=dead THEN [Krogan_Leader]=Wreav"" situations where there are only minor changes.

ME2 was the same. If you kill Wrex in ME1, there's another Krogan leader in exactly the same role as Wrex when you go to Tuchanka. If you kill Kaiden in ME1, you meet Ashley in ME2, who yells at you for working with Cerberus even though you'd think Cerberus would be right up her racist alley.

What would have been nice, but I knew would not happen, is that if you went straight renegade through ME1 and 2, you'd find yourself in an utterly hopeless situation in ME3. This -sort of- happens because renegade decisions deprive you of a lot of resources, and you'll see humanity being wiped out by the colorful explosion in the ending cutscene, but then you can simply do dozens of survey missions or multiplayer to prevent that.

ME3 -does- suffer from the ""let's make it appeal to a wider audience (i.e. people who haven't played ME1 and 2) But this doesn't bother me as much as it does in movies. Video games are not like movies - they become dated very quickly in the eyes of the overwhelming majority of gamers. No studio is going to put up the capital necessary for a game like ME3 and have the attitude ""you know what, screw people who haven't played the previous games! If they want the experience, they'll just have to start at the beginning."" Not going to happen.

It's a downside of big-budget games, and it's frustrating. I get it. But I don't see anything in ME3 that justifies the whinging and raving I've seen related to it."

I can't remember the last time I saw a film which still has me feeling its tone after driving home, kicking off my shoes, and pouring a glass of milk.

I like milk.

Anyhow, when a person curses like Joe Pesci in a Martin Scorsese film, those curses carry no weight.  When a person who almost never swears does so, you feel it.  This movie doesn't swear much.  The pacing is very smooth, quiet, and deliberate, (much like the protagonist who is a bit of a sociopath) and it takes its time getting to the conflict.  There are hints at where the story might be headed, and at times I wondered if the movie was going to decide on a direction.  What the movie is actually doing is weaving you into the subdued and meticulous way The Driver sees his world.  But like the film, inside The Driver's terse exterior lies terrifying intensity.  

Personally I would have enjoyed more, or lengthier car chases.  But there were tits, so that is nice."

This is not rational, I realize, because I'm talking about physical work that goes on for many hours.  So, I bite my tongue.

But dammit!  When there's a big job to do, I hate stopping for anything until it is done.  I usually don't get hungry if I'm working, and on those occasions I do, eating becomes this very annoying thing that I have to do while I continue working.  If I have to pee, it means I -run- to the bathroom, blast it out, spray water on my hands for half a second and run back.

I did see her briefly when opening the bedroom door to bring in their dresser. She gasped and looked terrified, and the husband quickly stepped in front of me, instructed me to bring it in later, and shut the bedroom door. I heard him speak quietly for a moment, then he came out.  I left the apartment, grabbed more pieces, and returned to find the bedroom door open.  I gave the man an inquiring look and he said that it was fine now. Upon entering the bedroom, I saw the shadow of her feet moving about in the light shining through the bottom of the closet door.

"event","The past few weeks, I have been amusing myself during drives to and from work by switching between the conservative talk radio station and progressive talk radio station.  I'd listen to one until I couldn't bare the madness any further, then switch to the other.  Rinse and repeat.

From this experience, I developed a BINGO game. Every square contains something I actually heard either from a host or caller.  Mostly hosts.

Rules:
Pick a bias and use the corresponding board.  
CHALLENGE MODE!  Play with a friend, each listening to opposing stations and see whose station reaches BINGO first!

"event","A quick bit of background.

BioWare is a video game developer which specializes in story-driven role playing games.  Within these games you interact with other characters, some of whom you can romance.  Choose your words wisely, and you are rewarded with a PG-13 love scene.  Romance options typically included at least two heterosexual choices, and one same sex choice.  The same sex choices typically began with great subtlety so as not to offend the homophobic, but this has since changed.

In Dragon Age 2, BioWare's most recent game, some of the romanceable characters will initiate flirtations with you, regardless of your character's gender.  This offended the delicate sensibilities of one player, who fancied himself a spokesman for ""the straight male gamer.""  He posted a long-winded complaint, attacking BioWare for neglecting and offending the straight male gamer, which should be catered to since they are the biggest demographic.

BioWare responded brilliantly:

"event","I finally watched ""Kinsey"" which has been on my to-watch list since it came out.  I knew going in that it wasn't completely accurate, but heard it was considerably more so than most biopics.  I enjoyed it, though I had to chuckle at one point, as it seemed the writer or director said to himself ""wait a minute... we've got <i>Liam Nieson</i> here!  We need to have a scene where he says 'I could have helped them!  I could have done more!' and weeps!""

But hey, speaking of the holocaust...

<lj-cut text=""Terrorism, Nazism, Kinsyism - one in the same?"">
Ok.  There are legitimate criticisms of Kinsey's research.  Given the era in which it took place and the extremely personal nature of the questions in his sex surveys - questions that would make a many people who grew up in an age when we can see a video of a woman with a strap-on boning a man in clown paint for free on the internet - he was likely to get complete answers only from those who were willing to sit down for the whole thing and not simply say ""get out of here, you creep! I'm done with your questions!""  And those who were more comfortable answering such questions are likely to be more comfortable with sexual experimentation, thus suggesting that there is a higher percentage of ""sexual deviance"" than there actually is.

Oh, I knew the reply from the puritanical crowd had to be more harsh than ""hey your science isn't sufficiently rigorous!"" but had no idea just how utterly mental some of the characters got.

Judith Reisman.  Ever heard of her?  She has served as a consultant to the U.S. Dpts. of Education and Health and Human Services, and once received a $750,000 grant from Regan's Justice Dpt. to study pornography.  America, says her husband as he introduces her to an eager crowd in 2004, has lost the greatest war of the 20th century.  

Surely he can't mean World War II or the Cold War, I mean we won those.  The war on drugs?  The war on poverty?  No, he speaks of a war on morality, perpetrated by homosexuals, adulterers, and least of all Kinsey himself, and characterized by the repeal of antisodomy laws, legalization of abortion, and any societal ill you can imagine. Reisman herself compared the Kinsey Report to the September 11th attacks, resulting in ""50 years of cultural terrorism.""  She spread utterly unsubstantiated rumors that Kinsey hired men to rape infants, and likely participated in it himself.

Of course, her slander is not limited to Kinsey.  Speaking of gays, she describes their ""recruitment techniques"" as more intense than those of the Marine Corps.  (Strange, for I've known, worked with, and been friends with several gays and lesbians, yet have never felt ""recruited.""  Perhaps I'm not sexy enough.) Meanwhile, she asserts that the holocaust and Nazism in general was perpetrated by the German homosexual community, and in present-day America, gay youth groups are being formed under the same principles as the Hitler Youth.

Before I said anything, she said to me ""I had a really great time!"" and suggested getting together next weekend.  She also said she'd have to send me her 'real' email address.

"event","Everywhere I turn around on the internet, it seems folks are blaming the shooting spree targeting Gabrielle Giffords on Sarah Palin and the Tea Party / Republican party in general.

I'm going to try to make sense of it.

<lj-cut text=""Palin&#39;s crosshairs campaign before and after the shooting"">
In a 2010 Republican Party advertising campaign called ""take back the 20"", crosshairs were placed over 20 congressional seats the party lost in the 2008 election.  Sarah Palin was the main face behind this campaign.  

Since the shooting, Palin's PR staff have carried out an abortive campaign of damage control, closing (I hear) her facebook and myspace pages, deleting copies of the ad campaign from republican websites, and so forth.  Some feel this behavior indicates culpability.

In truth, it's typical political ass-covering that one sees from politicians everywhere.  Any time there's the slightest chance that a political opponent might cast a prior action in a negative light, a politician goes into overdrive trying to pretend said action never happened.  We do it with other things too.  For example, Spiderman 2's promo posters featured the World Trade Center with a web between them.  Then 9-11 happened.  The studio pulled all the posters digitially removed the twin towers from the movie. Radio stations stopped playing songs having to do with air travel (at least for a month or two). A metal band from New York called DreamTheater released an album on 9-11-01. The cover featured an apple with the NYC skyline (featuring the twin towers) on fire. The record label frantically shipped stickers with the band logo big enough to cover up the image to all the retailers, asking them to pull the CDs and apply the stickers.  Did they do that because they were worried someone might think DreamTheater and Spider Man 2 were behind 9-11?  No.  They did it because they were afraid of bad press.

As for the use of crosshairs in the republicans' political ads, you can quickly find out how often crosshairs are used by ad agencies to either promote a client's goal or focus attention on an opponent. CNN has a program called ""Crossfire.""  We have a major department store chain named Target whose logo is a bull's eye. Do a google image search for ""Crosshairs"" and see how often it comes up.  Is it classy?  No.  But it doesn't incite people to murder either.
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Jared Lee Loughner&#39;s videos and reading list"">
Enough about Palin for a moment.  Take a look at Jared Lee Loughner, the shooter.  Over the past months, he made several Youtube videos.

Here's one.
<lj-embed id=""61""/>

Here is another
<lj-embed id=""62""/>

And here's the tl;dr version:  ""Hello.  I am schizophrenic and absolutely bat-shit insane.  Some of my ideas are: we need to create a new currency, I am one of the 5% of Americans who dream, the government controls our religion and our minds, and people need to educate themselves in English grammar.""  I find the last bit amusing as he consistently uses ""you're"" for ""your.""

If you watch these videos, I think it's fair to say we can agree this man is absolutely off his rocker.

Also, here is a list of his favorite books off his Youtube page:
Animal Farm, Brave New World, The Wizard Of OZ, Aesop Fables, The Odyssey, Alice Adventures Into Wonderland, Fahrenheit 451, Peter Pan, To Kill A Mockingbird, We The Living, Phantom Toll Booth, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp,Through The Looking Glass, The Communist Manifesto, Siddhartha, The Old Man And The Sea, Gulliver's Travels, Mein Kampf, The Republic, and Meno.  Quite a gamut of political ideology here.  Communism, progressivesm, anti-communism, fascism, anti-semitism and anti-racism alike, not to mention tales of childhood both heartwarming and dark, not the single-minded reading list you would expect from a hard core right-winger.

Given these slices of his life, to suggest that this man was incited to murder representative Giffords and her supporters by a Republican campaign ad is akin to the claims that the Collumbine shooters did what they did because they played violent video games and listened to Marilyn Manson.  

This was a very sick and disturbed man.  He was going to kill someone, and that someone was going to be a person in political power.  If his local representative happened to be a Republican, we would likely hear Republicans trying to find a way to pin the blame on Progressive rhetoric.
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""the state of American political discourse"">
What I find most ironic about the political reaction to this tragedy is that in blaming this murder on ""violent political rhetoric"" one contributes to that same violent political rhetoric. 

Please understand that I loathe the present condition of political discourse in America.  I think it is full of hate, hyperbole, intentional misinterpretations, omissions, and outright lies, and is utterly counter productive.  This did not begin with Palin, nor did it begin with Keith Olberman.  Liberals and Conservative politicians and pundits are equally to blame.  But the ultimate culprit in this is us.  We continue to listen to the loudmouths.  We tune to the most extreme talk shows that support our prejudices.  Men like Keith Olberman and Glenn Beck tell us everything is the other guy's fault, that we are better and smarter than them, that if we listen to them and support them, everything will be better.  And we love them for it.

This doesn't make murderers of men like Loughner any more than it does of you or I.  What it does do, however, is make us sheep."

"event","Numerous ""Secession Balls"" were held in Southern cities this holiday season to commemorate the 150th anniversary of secession and the formation of the Confederate States of America in late 1860 and early 1861.

Proponents of these festivals have claimed, as have many proud Southerners past and present, that the impetus for secession and the Civil War which followed had little or nothing to do with slavery.  This is sometimes followed by a claim that only a tiny percentage of those who fought in the civil war owned slaves.

<lj-cut text=""How many rebel soldiers came from slave owning families?"">
To address the later first, it is one of those technically-true statements made to mislead.  Most soldiers were young, single men who lived with their families and while having no slaves to their name, came from slave owning families.  According to the 1860 census, 32% of white southerners lived in slave owning households, and according to the records of the Army of Northern Virginia, the CSA's largest army, 42% of volunteers in 1860 and 1861 came from slave owning families.  Thus, a far greater percentage of boys from slave-owning families volunteered for service than boys from families without slaves. (Sauces: the 1860 census and Joseph Glathaar's ""General Lee's Army"")
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""The Great Moral Truth upon which the Confederacy was founded."">
As for the former, I have seen many arguments both for and against, most relying on conjecture.  I prefer to go straight to the source.  On March 21st 1861, Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the CSA gave an address which was met with resounding applause. It became known as the ""Cornerstone Address"" as it outlines the cornerstone upon which his new nation was built.

""The prevailing ideas entertained by most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically.

""Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition. This, our new Government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.""

You hear naught but silence.
After several seconds, an annoyed voice says, ""Hel-low"" with an implied ""it's rude to answer and not say anything.""

You see, that person never heard your greeting because he or she is phoning from a call center whose computer made the connection prior to the call center employee ""picking up.""

However, this characterizes approximately half of the telemarketing calls I receive at work.  Surely the above is a common enough occurance that the average telemarketing employee would realize he or she is picking up several seconds after the recipient has picked up the phone, and thus, not be wondering with irritation as to why they have not greeted you.  Moreover, would it not behoove said telemarketer's employer to explain this situation to any new employee?

Unfortunately, what the bill actually does is make it legal to grow and sell pot... if you successfully navigate a highly complex bureaucracy in order to obtain a dispensiry license, of which the state will only issue a small number.  Selling pot without a license will have a far greater criminal consequences after Prop. 19 than selling it now. 

In other words, the whole thing is set up to limit access to a multibillion dollar industry to those with sufficient wealth, legal savvy, and political clout to obtain a dispensiry license.

We are not.

I concede that he does, at time, make valid points.  But so does Michael Moore, and I can't stand him either.  Why? Because neither of them give a damn for honesty, facts, or has respect for their readers / listeners.

The latest from Beck imbues me with a desire to bash my head repeatedly against a wall.

<lj-cut text=""Slavery was cool until government got involved"">
Beck:  ""I would like to propose that the president is exactly right when he said, ""slaves sitting around the campfire didn't know when slavery was going to end, but they knew that it would. And it took a long time to end slavery."" Yes it did. But, it also took a long time to start slavery. And it started small. And it started with seemingly innocent  ideas. And then a little court order here and a court order there, and a little more regulation here and a little more regulation there. And before we knew it, America had slavery. It didn't come over in a ship to begin with as an evil slave trade. The government began to regulate things because the people needed answers, they needed solutions. It started in a courtroom and then it went to the legislatures. That's how slavery began. And it took a long time to enslave an entire race of people, and to convince another race of people that they were somehow or another less than them. But it can be done. I would ask you to decide: Are we freeing slaves? Or are we creating slaves? That's a question that must be answered.""

Okay.

Okay.

As a student of the English language, I understand what he attempted to do here.  

He's trying to use something that is often an effective tool of persuasive writing & speaking: Start by referencing something your opponent recently said/wrote and agree with it (at least partially), then say ""however..."" and use the theme of the comment to move toward your thesis.

Generally, this tactic works just fine. It's disarming, it increases the likelihood that your opposition will listen, and it makes your statement fit smoothly into existing dialogue by providing context.

However, it doesn't work when you're using horrible examples or simply MAKING SHIT UP.

Just in case there's any confusion as to the development of American slavery (Slavery is hardly unique to America, for it existed for thousands of years prior, and in a variety of forms, all of them wicked and cruel, and all of them rationalized by the ruling class).  So here's how it got started in America

Dutch guy:  ""Dude, you know how we control a lot of Africa, and you control a lot of the New World?""
British guy:  ""Indeed.""
Dutch guy:  ""What if we sold you some Africans from our colonies there? You could put 'em to work farming tobacco and sugar in your colonies.""
British guy:  ""You <i>are</i> speaking of slaves yes, my good man?""
Dutch guy: ""Um... duh?""
British guy:  ""Smashing.  Well! We are rather short on coin.  Would you accept payment in trade goods?""
Dutch guy: ""Those Africans are buying up liquor like nobody's business, man, and they're not picky.  Make some cheap and we can resell it to 'em at good profit.""
British guy: ""Mmm.  Rum would be quite uncostly to make with the sugar we can grow in the colonies.  I speculate our colonials in the Americas would pay well for laborers in their tobacco fields as well.  Hmm.... YOU THERE.  Colonials!  Might I interest you in some strapping African laborers?  Plenty of market for increased tobacco crops eh?""
American colonist:  ""Ah yew fine ghentlemen suggestin' slavery?""
British & Dutch guys: ""Yes! what part of this is unclear to you?""
American colonist: ""Yew bring the darkies to us, and we'll bring them the word of Jesus Christ.""
Dutch & British guys:  ""...and make piles of money.""
American colonist: ""Amen.""

As cringe-worthy as many parents are, I firmly believe that government should not interfere with a person's choice to have, or not to have children.  As such, I suppose that means I think this is a fundamental human right.

I hesitate to say this However, as such a statement is often misconstrued to imply that a person is entitled to financial assistance from the government just because she chose to have children.

The government should not reward or punish individuals for their lifestyle choices.  Citizens must be expected to make responsible decisions and manage the consequences of those decisions.  While this is not reality - people make dumb choices all the time! - when government looks after foolish people, it merely encourages foolishness and guarantees that they, and others, will not learn from their mistakes.

Sadly, children born to parents who are financially unable to provide for them had no part in the decision.  They, at least, must be looked after.  It's also important to realize that shit happens.  Events beyond the most responsible parent's control can lead to hard times.  In the past, extended family, private community and charitable organizations, and neighbors helped out in such situations.  This is the most ideal solution as it preserves family unity, dignity, and most importantly, provides the needed assistance quickly and efficiently, without government waste and bureaucracy.   

The only remedy government should provide when children are not being looked after is to place the children with another family, preferably a close relative.  This is a last resort which gives maximum incentive to a concerned parent to find a better, more responsible solution."

It would be some epic orchestral prog metal with Celtic folk influences and a female lead singer and choirs and... it would be awesome.

The cover art would be me wearing a suit, standing in front of my keyboard and looking intense and serious.  The keyboard would conceal my body from my navel to my thighs.  I would wear no pants."

I walk to my car, sit down, and realize I'd forgotten my wallet.  Run back in, grab wallet, return to car, now I'm driving and a squirrel darts out in front of me.  I swerve to avoid him, but hear a <i>thump</i> and look in my mirror to see the poor thing flopping on his side.  I stopped, and the moment I got out of my car, I hear children crying.  Because I happened to hit that squirrel where?  Right in front of a school bus stop.

So I walk over to the little guy who isn't moving any more and look him over.  The absence of blood makes me hopeful that perhaps he was only stunned.  Wary of rabies and such, I resist the urge to pick him up right away and first nudge him with the toe of my shoe.  Still no movement.  I pick up his soft, limp body, warm in my hands, and hold my fingers over his chest and neck.  For a moment, I think I feel his little heart give a single beat, but it doesn't come again.

I begin carrying his body out of the road and into the trees that line it.  At least it was quick, I think, just as an anxious little girl shouts from the bus stop, ""Is he okay?""

Generally, my instinct is to tell the truth, and I begin to answer as such, but fortunately, I only get past the ""N"" in ""No"" when I realize this was probably not the best answer.  Death is a part of life, but it's best for kids to come to terms with it when they have a parent there for comfort. I set him down behind a bush before answering. ""He's just knocked out,"" I lie.  ""Don't go near him.  If you wake him up, he'll probably be frightened and could bite you.""

I've hunted in the past and have no problem shooting an animal and eating it.  But waste like this makes me sad.  He was a cute little guy."

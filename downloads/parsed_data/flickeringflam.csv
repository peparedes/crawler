A bit relieved...
A bit overwhelmed...
Really happy. 
I will find out within a month about both UNE, and COA (University of New England and College of the Atlantic). 
Nice, I say, very nice. 

Maine Maritime's deadline date is apparently July 1...which is absolutely obsurd...because you know, I have to tell guidance by May which school I'm going to. Whatever. It's in Thursday. 

University of Maine starts the application process on January 1. Mine will be in before then, and therefore I get first up on scholarship and shit like that. 

Thanksgiving was...well Thanksgiving. Aunt Kathy gave me two shirts and some hair stuff that I don't think will ever work on my hair. 

And Stoneham won? Yeah, I know. Eleven years and we haven't won against Reading. We did though, 21-7. Creamed them, I bet Reading felt like crap to be beat by us. Then again, we did beat Lexington earlier in the year. 

And so I'm contemplating making my prom dress. Christina is doing it and told me I should too...dunno...maybe....


Xmas is coming up. I'm happy. But it means that on Xmas eve all the cousins will be running around...upstairs...and in my fucking room. NO way. If any of them touch the stuff in my room without me being there, I'll freak. Kelly knows her boundaries, Garrett doesn't. 

Whatever. It's a month away...

Guess what's in eighteen days though? My birthday, hell yeah! The big 18! :) Get me something good, and I'll love you forever. :)"

On a higher note, we won tonight. I guess this means congratulating the boys on winning. 20-19 against Lexington. Anyways...yeah, I have work tomorrow at fucking seven AM. I'm tired, so I'm gone. People asked me to update, and here it is..."

Lisa: flipping out on register trying to get her scan time up. I love it, it's hilarious. At least she didn't put an empty box on her head like she did the last time....*sigh* memories. 

I had a good, long, talk with the father tonight...a little weird that he actually listened, but ya know...surprises are always around the corner. I half want to work tomorrow, the other half is like...naaahhhhh....whatever. There is a shit load of drama going on in the Myspace group...and then Dave was like ""I'm the Shaws bunny."" :) Funnnnnn

So...this huge end of the summer blowout? I don't know who the hell to invite. Well, the obvious people, who know who they are. But should I invite people I'm close to from work? Like...Ashley and Marci are being invited. And most likely Katie, Lisa, and Jeff...I just don't know who the hell else? Harount? Emoney? WHHOOOOO???? Suggestions: Nice. Oh, and any suggestions for activities and shiz for the party would be good. My list is growing, so I need to start getting stuff for it. 

AANNNNNYYYWWWAAAYYYYSSS.....I'm stuck in a rut. I can either finish writing my two stories I have now, or start working on the two new ones I'm going to...start. I have no clue what to do...I also have to finish summer reading, watch those three movies, and uggghhh....Amber, I say we have a movie night and just watch all three movies at once. Give me a call....

So....I'm a Senior...isn't that scary? Aren't you scared to think of me as a Senior? Haha, this entry...is so happy compared to my 'translucentflam' one...ain't it? Most likely because I got out my rage on the computer...love the people who haven't even met me and still know me better than some other people...yah...whatever. I'm out, tired, and feeling like I should go watch a nice long movie...

Just thought I'd let you know. 
Saturday night was wonderful, 
The show went awesome,
And before second act the entire cast was dancing backstage
My will gift=Next in line for the throne....
Gotta love Alycia for making that one up. 
Totally tortured Danny on his will gift *cough cough*
And Marc had ONE pixi stick and totally LOST IT!!! 
I'm too damn tired....I cried because all the seniors are leaving..


I remember when I first met Jen during OOTI
And she's like ""Hi, I'm Jen!"" 
And I'm like ""Hi, I'm Leigh-Anne!"" 
I cry soo much....because I can't let them go...

DAMNIT WHY CAN'T YOU ALL FAIL!!!!!!!????

And Jonathon is going to damn Texas and Becca is going to Ohio (Kenya...of all the places). And I've gotten so close to Buckley this year...and Laura and Jamie, and everyone else. And Cassie!!!!! 

Damn seniors make me cry......and the only good thing is that I'll be able to visit Corie and Jessica a lot....

I'm sick, I threw up last night. I couldn't even fall asleep because I couldn't breathe at all. I finally did, and thought maybe I'd feel better this morning, but I felt worse. Mom let me stay home, and I pretty much stayed in bed until she called, then ate, and took medicine, and then just ate some lunch. At least I can kinda talk now....


It seems everyone is home sick today...blach.....I blame the musical for making me belt out.

Well...well...well...lookies what we have here...an update of sorts!!!! I know you all missed my updates, oh so VERY much, so here's a nice lil one for ya...

Vacation...is...over! Why??? I was TOTALLY out of it today in study (NEVER HAVE MARQUIS MAKE YOU A COFFEE!!!!! NEVER!!!!!!)...well, yeah mostly do to Chris. I'm a mess...then nice ol' chemistry rolled around and mr. cummings shaved...which made him look jus' a bit weird there for a sec...black...teehee...

Oh..and Marc is a total mess. I dont know HOW it happened, or WHY it happened, but today in history he couldn't stop LAUGHING! He was insane, and to make it worse, we're talking about spies and the a-bomb and we're all cracking up laughing when Kris walks in and he's like 'what the fuck just happened?"" which made us laugh even harder. Le sigh..such a messed class.


So. I know you all want to know what I did during vacation..so here is the lil summary...

<b>Friday:</b> Went out w/Ashley (who got hit by a softball at the batting cages) and then to shaws to pick up marci around ten-ish where Ryan V. showed us his new carriage trick...
<b>Sat/Sun:</b> I HAVE NO CLUE!!! I worked, but that's all I remember....
<b>Monday:</b> Erm...I believed I stayed home...still a bit fuzzy to me...hah...sry if I hung out w/you on this day and I totally forgot...remind me...
<b>Tuesday:</b> TOTALLY hung out w/Jessica. Saw Phantom (hah! WHERE THE HELL DID HER STOCKINGS GO??!!!) and then Uno's (MMM...bbq chicken pizza w/mozzeralla sticks..). Then mall (got purty things...and janelle's present!) and then back to her house, then mine to get sleepover materials, then Shaws, then her house where we preceded to watch Legally Blonde II and make sundaes, the first time i had ice cream for over A YEAR!! Insane...
<b>Wednesday:</b> Preceded to drama...after drama??? I dont' remember..I remember hitting a pole during drama..(Deidre: WATCH OUT FOR THE POLE!!!!!!) JK!!!!!!!!
<b>Thursday:</b> Ahhh...drama again, then mall w/Janelle (don't remember what I got..I think...something...books??? perchance janelle remembers)
<b>Friday:</b> Dude...I don't know...I'm so messed
<b>Saturday:</b> Lazy for awhile then work.
<b>Sunday:</b> Mall w/Beth...yippee!!! I got my mom her mother's day gift from Build A Bear. I'll post a pic later...it was quite cheap, actually. about $25, that's it...and it's so damn cute!!
<b>Monday:</b> Skewl...drama...then we went to wayside bazaar after dropping erica off so meggy could get makeup for gym...yes gym...

Because in gym our final is....

ready??

are you sure???

IT'S THRILLER!!!! 
And me, Jmo, Erica, and Caitlyn are all in charge of makeup/costumes..whoopee for being in drama...like woah.....

Interesting quotes:
Carolyn: HE HAS A TAN LINE!!!!
Ryan: Hey, I wanna join in if you're smoking weed!
Me (to jessica): Whoops...(1/2 hr. later) whooops...
^^Highway fun stuff...teeheee^^
Justin: What did the dog say?
Kiley: No, he said it in Portugese.
Jessica: You know, I wondered what happened to her stockings?
Jessica: Raoul is SUCH a wussy.

Beautiful Angel

<b>Emotions twisted into a knot, 
I cannot bear to look around
To see the pain on classmates faces
As they wonder why it happened.
And although we know 
You're happy in heaven.
All we want is to see you
One last time.
But the harsh reality sinks in,
That we won't see your smiling face,
And as the tears sting our eyes
We wonder how others can smile.
And we wonder how life goes on, 
When we have lost someone 
So dear to us.
And as we mourn for our loss,
We know you're smiling down on us,
As the beautiful Angel that you are. </b>

"event","Okay, so I'll update. What's happened? Once again, I realize that I need to pretty much write down what happens, because I forget it. Research paper is going well, that much I can say, I just need to re-type my outline and then four pages are due on friday. MY CAR IS FIXED!! We brought it in yesterday at, like 1, and then he called my mom at work at like ten and said it was ready! It looks brand new too! :) I'm so goober-excited (SO taken from Lily...). He didn't have to get a new front end or anything, and since he had a old taurus in the lot, he just took spare parts from that for my car. It looks loverly! :)

Blah to school. I had chem lab today, and me and suzzy were like ""WHY ARE WE MELTING ICE???"" Very frustrated, but this time we didn't fail, lmao. Usually, Mr. T. Cummings shakes his head whenever he walks past us b/c we're just like that :). Oh, well, we have fun despite the fact that I have 3 hours of chemistry in a row w/cummings...ergh....

Well, work is...okay. I guess...Jons gone for a bit, so I miss him, and stuff. Marci and Ashley will be off on spring break next week, so they won't be there..sheesh...erhg...le sigh. 

Going to Carnival Ball friday afternoon. Sure to be fun, 'specially with the inside joke of mr. cummings about kyle, shall be hilarious!!! CANNOT wait to see Jessica's costume either, should be loverly as always. Usually, I dont' do the whole carnival ball thing, but i decided that this year i might as well. Tomorrow, after school me and amanda are making yummy cupcakes for history and the New Deal. Le sigh. I want to go to sleep but the outline is calling me...along with ""Boondock Saints."" I must give in to my inner Irish feeling...but i can't!!!! (haha, MAJOR insider with Lily...lots of those ?)"

I hate the research paper I used to be like 'hey it'll be good, don't worry about it.' But today, when I checked out frickin SIX books on the Vietnam War from the library, i knew I was screwed. I really don't want to do this outline and I'm putting it off as long as I can. I just don't feel like writing it now. I mean, I know what I'm going to write, I just don't feel like going through the books and crap. It's due Tuesday, so I can set it up on the computer. I've already done the rough, rough outline but i just don't feel like actually writing it out and crap. Oh, well. I guess I should. Maybe I'll watch ""Tigerland"" (mmmmm...Colin Farrell) and get inspired. Whatever, blah...i'm just blah...oh, wait...I don't have Tigerland...ergh

I hate prom There, that's enough, I hate it. It's not going to work out with Dave, so forget it. I just need to not go. Make it better for me. As far as I know, I hate it...honestly hate it. HATE IT!! It's too much stress on top of family problems, work problems, my so called friends problems, dancing problems, and everything else...grrr....

Yeah, so some may have noticed the whole so called friends thing up there...yeah. I hate it when someone keeps saying they are depressed and they're always depressed and crap. Okay, in the beginning I was like 'hey, it's okay, don't be depressed.' But now it's always in their away messages and they're always like 'i hate my life blah blah blah.' Now, before any of you yell at me, Dallim I'm definitely not talking about you, never! The person who I'm talking about knows that I'm talking about them. And it's that same person that goes on my old sn and talks to the people on that sn, pretending to be me....I can't even change my password because I don't remember the old one. I hate it, honestly hate it. Silvio asked why the hell i was swearing at him and crap online...on the old sn....and the sn which happens to be Lily's sn now!! WTF??? Why the hell do you go on someone else's sn and pretend to be them? What, do you get a kick out of it? ARGH!!!!!!!


Now that that's all done with, here's my happy crap....

Tuesday/Wednesday- Went to Woburn theatres w/Jessica and got lost. We went on the backroads and went to far until we came to a small curvy road and I'm like ""are we supposed to be driving this far?"" and she's like ""um...probably not."" Hah, we made it to the theatres by 7:45 so it was all good. We went to see Constantine. I liked it, I think I'd want to see it again, most likely because Keanu Reeves didn't kiss her...yay!!! Then on the way back we went to Shaws to pick up yummies and then on the way back to her house (I was sleeping over) a light on the street went off and I freaked because there's a scene where the street lights go off and it's freaky...wanna know what happened? Go see the movie..hah. When we got to her house, we watched ""ever after"" and ""Stepford Wives."" Amber sat between us (actually jumped between us) whilst watching ""Ever After"" and it was fun and crap. Next day we made pancakes and eggs, yum. Then I had to go. 

Wednesday- Couldn't go to NH so we went to the Natick mall (me, Ashley, Marci and one of Marci's friend's Steph) and then visited Steph's home town of Holliston and drove around trying to find Officer Thompson and to get a look at her bf. I think he saw us when he drove past, it was wicked hilarious. Oh, at the mall me and Ashley shared a BBQ chicken pizza...yum!!! I love that! Tastes so good! I got some fun stuff for St.Pattys day...as usual. Oh, on the way to the mall, we got lost (me and Ashley) and then when we got there, we went out the out...technically we went out of the mall. And then we were trying to find our way back in and drove by the army base in Natick (where I'll most likely be stationed) and almsot got hit by a train...woot fun. 

I need Silvio like woa....even though we only talk online....still....

Some quotes from the past few nights 

Amber: I don't like that color blue. 
Amber (Uh...actually Tweety): Call me Tweety
Steph: I THINK HE SAW US!!!
Steph: Let's try to get pulled over by Officer Thompson!
Jessica (pulls shawl over face in movie): NOOO!!! 
Ashley: AHHH!!! (After we almost got hit by a train)
Ashley: Leigh-Anne, they have guns!! THEY'RE ARMED!!!!

Now, I'm just finishing up my outline for the research paper (FUN!) so it's all good. It's long and crap but whatever, it's going to help me in the end. So....yeah...PRISM tomorrow...woot...."

So...I started the wonderful research paper. Fun, I'm going to do the Vietnam War: Could we have won? Mrs. Hogan was like ""Oh! I can't wait to read it!"" And she acted all excited like she does. Heehee. Oh, well, lots of research to do on that there paper. 

So, we decided on our courses for next year. As it goes I'm taking Physics, English, Pre-Calc, Creative Writing, Fashion, Astronomy, Medical Science, Internation Relations, Film Study and Community Service. It's a mouth full, but if they cut my relations class, I'm gonna take Oceanography or something like that. I was having problems because we need five leveled courses and I don't want to take Italian next year, and most history courses I've taken or are not leveled, but I figured it out. Oh, well. That's how life goes I guess. 

Prom...ha! It's a mess, that's what it is. Jess isn't going, or so she tells me (BUT YOU SHOULD GO!!!!!!!!!!!) and all of you know the *other* problem. 

Yeah, and I finally caved and got a myspace. La Sigh. Oh, well, I guess it's all good. Lot's of old friends on there, that's true enough. But...yeah. I already had a photobucket and such. Much to Jame's prodding. Sigh again. I'm going to watch a movie/or type. I'm just plain old bored."

Stole the first thing from Cat, the second from Kiley....


Post a memory of me.
It can be anything you want,
just so long as it happened.

Then post this in your journal.
See what people remember about you.




[01] Reply with your name and I will write something about you.
[02] I will then tell what song[s] remind me of you.
[03] Next, I will tell you who you remind me of, celebrity/animated or otherwise.
[04] Last, I will try to name a single word that best describes you.
[05] Put this in your journal!"

"event","So, I figured (and so did Tarsha) that by going into work today, I now officially have twenty and a half hours this week for work. Hopefully will break the 150 mark...hopefully.

Snow day again today and possibly tomorrow because it's supposed to snow again and we're supposed to get eight inches. Driving home from work it was snowing a bit too, so hopefully...maybe. If not, whatever. We still only have school til 9:45 tomorrow. 

Um...let's see...I hate the damn snow right now because i can't back into my driveway and can't take the backroads to work. I was stuck in twenty minutes of traffic this morning. Damn people. 

Talked to Jim last night, that was fun...hmm....

Who wants to do something tomorrow whether or not we have school????

"event","Okay, so I had an interesting night last night at the movies. Went to see ""Phantom"" again, cried my eyes out at the end. So, here's what made it interesting. 

Me, Kayla, Stella, Janelle, and Dalim all went to see it together. So, we get there about five minutes before the previews start and we see Kiley and Eric, who were planning to go see ""Lemony Snicket"" but decided they might want to see another one. That's not what made it so interesting though. We get into the theatre and watch previews, meanwhile I was telling Stella, Janelle, Kayla, and Dallim that they were all going to bawl their eyes out watching this movie. Anyway, just when the fire erupts from the chandlier this cop runs in and tells us we have to leave because the fire alarms are going off...ironic huh? Well, that ain't the half of it. So, we leave just as they cut to Raul trying to find Christine. We go outside and wait then they tell us we have to go to the other parking lot and they move us again. Then they open the doors for us. If we went to this one guy with our ticket stubs, then we got a free ticket, blah. Whatever. So, we go back in and we're chatting with the people in front of us. I've already seen this twice and one of the women in front of us had seen it twice too, so we started talking about it. Anyway, they start playing the movie...and they skipped ten minutes of the damn movie. So, the lady goes outside to tell someone but they won't change it. Ah, stupid people. Anyway, I bawled at the end of course. Then, after the movie, I explained to Janelle, Stella, Kayla and Dallim what happened in those ten minutes they cut. So, Stella starts playing this game in which she wins a ring...WITH A MONKEY!!! YAY! Now, I must go find lyrics for PotO because I've got ""Think of me"" stuck in my head and I can't think of some of the words"

"event","Okay, so two nights ago I had a wicked freaky dream..just thought I'd tell you all about it. Oh, and I have a new email address: fromtheheart07@hoobastank.com. I'm still using the Yahoo! one, of course. I've had it for four years! 

Anyway, back to the dream...freaky as I say..and the dracula who happened to be in it was the Dracula from Van Helsing...and that's scary.

This is how it went:
I was in this really dark room, and there was this chair right in the middle of the room. I knew I shouldn't have gone to the chair, but I did and sat down in it. So, I go and sit in it and it gets really really silent, like, almost like I had gone deaf. So, anyways, I'm sitting there and I know something is going to happen, but I don't leave or anything. All of a sudden there's this shadowy light from above me, but I don't look up, I don't know why I don't. I just...don't. Anyways, I'm still just sitting there when all of a sudden Dracula (played by Richard Roxbury in Van Helsing...that Dracula) appeared at the side of my chair and started laughing evilly (can't think of a word to describe it...maliciously??) at me. Then all of a sudden all this lightening goes off and I can see the rotting corpses of Dracula's brides and all of his fledglings are around me, all laughing except for the brides. The brides are literally pinned on the ceiling above me and we're hissing at me. I just screamed and Dracula pinned me against the chair, but I screamed more. So he pulled me up and closed his hand over my mouth until one of his flegdlings came and held me, pinning my arms to my back and holding my mouth closed. Then all the vampires we're quiet and Dracula paced around and started talking about his plans for this world and how he couldn't be killed anymore and that he always came back (strangely enough, ath this point Jessica's last chapter in the fanfic came back to me...about Dracula coming back every ten years or so, weird....maybe that triggered this dream). So, I'm just standing there and he keeps talking until he tells the guy holding me to let me go and he takes me and says he'll make me his 'queen' and then bites me...but before he could finish I was awakened...by my damn dog."

I'm thinking about you all, especially Rupert.  Valentine's Day was magnificent, and I'm glad I got to share it with someone as special to me as you are.  I love you with all my heart.

I've got to get going, but I might be online soon.  Talk to you all later.

Maybe just spending Valentine's Day weekend <i>away</i> from everybody would be wonderful.  I just need to figure out what to do before Valentine's Day comes up and I'm stuck still figuring out what to purchase.  

I got my room all clean and it doesn't smell like cat crap anymore.  I should really think before putting my cat's litter in my bathroom.  I think I should put them downstairs or something. 

We're going to begin on <i>Goblet of Fire</i> really soon.  We've had a whole hell of a lot of kids going up for roles and a whole lot of Bulgarians for the role of Krum.  I'm not sure how many, like almost 200 or so?  I hope he's at least cute or something, or I'd have to worry about Hermione's taste in boys.  I sure hope I don't have to kiss him."

My cat Bubbles scratched up my favourite pink plush pillow, my mum forgot to empty out the cat littler while I was gone so my room stunk, I stepped in a puddle of water and my shoe got all wet as well as my sock and I hate wet socks, I slipped on the front porch and about broke my ankle and my arm hurt so much from lifting so much heavy shit in my room.  

On a good note, I'm feeling much better now, and I want my boyfriend!  I'm going to snag Rupert and go off somewhere this weekend. It's Friday and I have to get away from this house for just a little while.  My Mum's driving me insane and Alex's schoolmates keep calling me Hermione.

"event","I absolutely can't belive Rupert made an icon of us getting slimed!  It was the most gross--fun--thing I've ever done in my entire life!! Rupert sure enjoyed it though, after we were leaving, he kept shaking on me like a wet dog does after you bathe it.  Not that I wasn't slimed enough, he just had to add more.  

I'm not getting this whole American football thingy but during that halftime show, everybody's all freaked out because Justin stripped Janet and to be frank, I'm getting tired of hearing about it everywhere I go.  Just leave it alone!  That's why I hate paparazzi and gossip bull, once something 'extreme' like that happens, they don't know when to stop talking about it.  Like that kiss bewteen Madonna and Britney.  That happened like what...a few months ago and people are still talking about it?  I'm also sick of hearing crap being said about <lj user=""jackson_michael""> as well, every time I turn on the telly, they've found out something new about the whole damn case and on every damn channel they are talking about it.  I'm sorry but I have a very low tolerance about crap like that.  It's just one of my major pet peeves.  

Anyways, I've done some icons for Michael and Anna so far, but I'm not finished yet.  I'll post them as soon as I'm finished finding some good pictures."

Anyways, went shopping today.  With my Dad and Alex.  I'm just about finished with my Christmas shopping, so far I've bought for Rupert, Tom, Dan, Jamie Lynn, Sean, Christian, the rest of our castmates including the adults, Devon, Matthew, Bonnie, *phew* and I still have more to buy for.  I still have to get something for my parents and Alex, and each a present for my two cats, Bubbles and Domino.  I'm thinking rhinestone collars in two different colours, what do you think?  Bubbles would look beautiful in a rhinestone collar, Domino's kinda shaky with his bell collar he's got on now, it's funny, he doesn't know where the noise is coming from and the reason I keep it on him is for pure entertainment ;) hahaha.

It's boring at home with no computer.  Just fishing around for new pictures on this one to make icons with is boring.  It's quiet.  Just a small vacation at home is grand, then it's promoting promoting promoting and spending a year more with Dan, Rupert and Tom.  Rupert loves it.  Spending time with me gets him all smilie and (I would say giggly but he'd hurt me haha) happy.  

So I asked my Mum if it was alright if I could spend a holiday with Sean and Christian.  She said it was alright after New Year's because we're going to the mountians for Christmas and get a cabin.  We're suppost to spend Christmas Eve with Dad to open presents from him.
   

Anyways, that's my update for today, I have to leave for the weekend and go to my Mum's house.  Blahhhh.  Here's my bloody schedule: mon, tue, wed, half of thursday is with mum, the rest of thursday, friday, saturday, and sunday is with Dad, and then we go back to Mum.  It's screwy.  Divorces suck. 

I think I'm going to spend a week of Christmas break with Rupert and return home the day before Christmas Eve then after Christmas it's off to Scotland to see Sean and Christian.  I have to keep some of my schedule open just in case Nick wants to drop by.  I hope he doesn't mind spending time with a thirteen year old :D  I can be quite entertaining.


Okay and I'm rambling.  Have to get going, Dad's going to take us to Mum's house soon, so ta-ta.

[Alright, since aim was being bitchy, I've decided to take a bit of a break from Emma after I leave for the weekend. Just to know that I don't have to worry about her being taken over by someone else.  If a mbp person would tell me that it's okay, I'd sure appreciate it (like johnny rzeznik person cough cough) 

I'm not sure when my computer at home will be fixed...we just may end up buying a newer one, who knows.  

I just really want to know if I don't have to have heartattacks whenever I have to go back home and worry about Emma being taken over.  

*puppy pout* 

if any mbp person would like to email me about this or something, my email is :

I am currently sitting in my trailer watching Bonnie, Devon and Matthew eat candy as quickly as they can. We have to get rid of all of this candy before set closes on Saturday, so they've been having competitions all day. This afternoon Bonnie ate so much she was literally jumping around her trailer. 

 Rupert and I have been amusing ourselves by throwing candy into the air and watching as they scramble for it. They're like little dogs. heh. Dan and Tom have disappeared somewhere, but none of us are crazy to go look for them

I just want to say thanks to everyone for letting me keep my journal and not bugging me too much. I finally decided to give up on my mum and have ordered a new computer. How long it will take to get to set, I have no idea. 

 Speaking of set, things here are going great. I'm a little worried about all these people who are coming in with invitations and then writing up their experiences and posting them on the web. That might sound rude, but come on! The major point about a premiere is that no one really knows what to expect. Can't the fans just trust us and wait until June? Though, come to think of it, the later release date probably has something to do with all of their snooping. Don't get me wrong, I love my fans- but honestly!

Oh yes, I would like to make sure you all know that I had no plans to go to Mexico and have hot wild sex with Dan. I love my Rupert too much. Dan was just thinking wishfully. But, hey, its not my fault I'm better than Tom. ;)

<lj-cut text=""(ooc)""><lj-cut>Hey, all right, here's the plan. No, I'm not the girl who plays Emma, but the girl who plays Bonnie. 'Emma' and I decided that I will take Emma until her computer gets fixed and she can take over full time. 'Emma' will still update from time to time and my main focus will always be Bonnie. So if Emma and Bonnie have a lot of co-existing story lines for a while, thats why. Also, if you have a serious story line with Emma, besides the obvious Rupert/Emma one, can you leave a comment and tell me about it, or your relationship with Emma. If you are looking for a story line with Emma, just email <i>me</i> at faking_bonnie@yahoo.com and I'll talk it over with <i>her</i> and we'll see what we can do!

"event","For a short time I posted some nightmares I had, messed up nightmares that involved someone who tried to mess up my life in the past. 
Maybe I was trying to tell that person I wanted to talk to them about things (just like my mind was telling me that I should go back home to get heal some old wounds), sort things out, make amends, but...I decided to erase that idea (as well as the post), and leave it to another day.

Life has been going well for me so far, I don't think I'm ready to risk it all just to reach out to someone who I could never be sure of their reaction(and at my best bet, I'm sure would rather lash out at me then listen).

It's like wondering whether you should attempt to help a scorpion from falling into a fire, or to avoid risking getting stung or burned, and allow it to fall to it's own demise (and be stricken with guilt afterwards for allowing something to die that you could have prevented).

Thinking about that, I wonder if A.B ever named his scorpion, I never asked...hmm"

"event","Hey Jen, I know I haven't chatted with you in awhile. So I'm leaving YOU a special message here! That's right, and entry dedicated to YOU baby!
(Feel special damnit!)

Anyways, I'm sorry we haven't chit chatted in awhile, but I think I told you where I was going, and where I am I don't have icq or MSN, and I haven't had it in a long time. So I might as well message you here and in your journal.

Things are going alright, I kind of miss Penny Candy nights with my friends, but oh well. Thus the price you pay for living in paradise (actualy, that's hawaii...but I'll go there someday, just you watch!)

I hope things are going alright with you and the boy. And I hope that you aren't getting into too much trouble (now now, don't do anything I wouldn't do...).
Besides, if you did anything naughty, I want to be there to hear about it dangit!

I e-mailed John awhile back, seems he's busy. There's a new chick in his life if he didn't tell you. She's not NEW, they've been on and off awhile now, but things are really heating up. I think my visits will now be limited because she'll be moving in with him. (Can you believe JOHN with a WOMAN in his house? Holy cow, this means he might have TOWELS for crying out loud!) But maybe not, it depends on her feminine issues...seems some women loath other chicks hanging out with their men. I really don't understand why so many women are insecure on that aspect. The more insecure you are the more unstable you make the relationship. Trust the guy and he'll be trustworthy. (Ok, that logic doesn't work if he's a pathalogical liar...but that's another story).

Argh, I'm rambling. 

I read your LJ, and I'm glad you got the Luii. I'm sorry I couldn't get the Luii from Corey for you, I just wasn't heading south any time soon....and well, you know where I went instead. (No one needs to know where this maiden travels, therefor it shall not be stated here).

I think I may have to let go of a few of my animals when I return. Unfortunately I think the Vipers and the Leos will be the first to go....I need to downgrade big time. No no, I'm keeping the ciliatus, no worries there. 

Well, I think this was a long enough sacred post to you. I hope you're having a GREAT life (as most people should).

She was happy....and she was amazed I was in on it too.

I met Hank, which was weird, he picked me up to bring me to the restaurant, and I've never met him before...he's a friend of Lexy's of course.

So needless to say that the ride there was a bit awkward....since I can be shy during first encounters. But I got over it eventualy....

Ah well, just to unveil some things from the night... I've never seen Lexy in anything dressy or revealing before...and she was in this tight short skirted dress with a low low cut v neck. Needless to say she looked amazing... Though I couldn't resist popping a few comments about her clevich, ...come on...she's got a LOT of it.

The other friends I met I talked to, but I can't say I formed too high of an opinion of. Hanks ok, your big tall quiet jock type (nice guy mind you)...I know Karl, he arranged the whole thing, and he's a major sweetie. I know Neil, but he couldn't show up because of work...and I've met Michelle, who just...didn't show up (so...she hasn't made the best impression on me...) The girls who turned up asides Lexy...well...they aren't the type I'd normaly hang out with. They are more the 'broke a nail' type....(you know what I mean Jen...""Like, Valley girl"") But they were nice enough...though I think my sense of humor was a bit too weird for them. But then again, not a lot of people can handle me untill they become accustomed to my mannerisms.

I'm amazed at how Karl went out of his way to arrange this months ago, he's an awesome guy. It's too bad that Lex doesn't feel the same way about him as he does about her though. But then again, I've seen Karls other side too...and I see why she would be turned off by him. (He doesn't have a nasty temper, he will just take things way too personaly).

"event","Alright, so I get to work ..yesterday? And first thing is Kirsti is like ""Oh Renee , so I heard about your little secret""
and I was like ""What the heck are you talking about?""
Anyways, it turns out that Carrie blew something up totally out of proportion.

K the other day, this guy wanted ten crickets, he's a regular, etc. Nice guy in general, but ya know, he's just a regular. Anyways, he mentioned something about cricket sizes, so I made the effort to find ones the sizes he wanted. He was thankfull, and I got a wiff of his gum, I commented that it smelt nice, and how I wish I had some gum cause quite frankly, I just had Quiznos and the after taste makes me feel like I've got onion breath.

Anyways, he says that he still has the gum packet in his car, and he runs out to get it for me and gives me a piece. I was quite suprised, I know it's something small, but most people don't make that kind of effort for people they don't know.

So I thought it was kind of sweet/nice. And I told Carrie when she came in that he was a nice guy, and brightened my day cause everyone else was kind of an arse that day, and just the one person being nice made me feel good. So now I see him as a really nice person.

Now she goes around saying that I have some crush on him, and I was at his beck and call the whole time he was there (for like an hour she said).

First off, he was there 5 minutes if that, and all I did was bag the crickets and get the gum and he was gone. Secondly she wasn't even THERE when he came in, and third, I don't get crushes.

So that proves that she can't keep anything to herself, she tells everyone everything, and she over exagerates.
 Just like she came to me today and told me that Ross was mad and aggitated that I hadn't got his frog yet. Like look, it's not my fault J sold out of them before I got to his house. I'll give him one of mine, and get one off of J later I guess. 

So I called Ross up and asked him about this, and he was like ""What the HELL is she talking about, you know I don't talk to her about anything in depth. Only you, Michael and Jordanna get that priviledge"" (LOL...ross is funny).
And he goes on about he never said such a thing, and she's just going off on something. If anything he said he can't wait to get the frog, and he wished I'd just bring it over.

Not to mention a few other things today...

Oh well, tis life. I got the new Pink CD , had to check it out. I wish there were more songs on it to be honest, but it sounds pretty nice. Though I only got it for two songs that I liked.


Now I'm only here writing this because I went to bed, and overheard other people having Sex. And sorry, but I just didn't want to hear it. People should learn how to be more quiet. I should be able to hear that stuff from my room...

Anyways, Carlee is coming to visit tomorrow...well...later today now technicaly. And I'm real excited, but she's leaving on Monday. And who know's when I'll see her again. J is bugging me because he knows she owes me a few hundred bucks, but I'm thinking I shouldn't mention it, I'm happy enough she's here. But he's telling me I need it for the animals etc...which is true. And who knows if I'll EVER see her again in reality, since she lives FAR away.

Mike told me to tell her that while she's here she HAS to take him out to coffee. He's real curious about what she's been up to.

BTw, I need knobtail geckos...
it has been decided.

And prunning all the plants in the plant tank is a messy job, and a smelly one at that. SPECIALY when the person who was supposed to do plant tank maintenance of the past few weeks hasn't been doing it...so when I get there, the smell of rotted hornwart and rotted snails coming from the water while gravel vacuuming is REALLY overpowering....

oh well, tis life


Hey Jen, what do you think of the spotted raphael catfish to go in my cichlid setup? He likes that pH level, and stays about 4"" (remember, this isn't the striped version) and with his spikes etc...no one would bug him."

My aunt wants me to move to florida during the winter and work for her. (She writes articles for magazines, and used to own one of the top health magazines in the U.S)...

And my friend Cor mentioned me just moving with him and helping him breed reptiles etc. Which would be awesome...

And yet Lex wants me to move in with her next year or the year after. As does Steph in two or three years when she comes this side to go to Uni. What to do...what to do...

Now where Steph wants to move is near J. So if I did move with her, I could still work for J. And in the meantime, I c ould work here till winter, then place my animals for the summer. I know a few people that could keep them no problem. Then I'd work for her for the winter, then come back here in time to move in with lex and relocate the pets.

The only thing is, I would do this if I didn't have my zoo. But I hate leaving friends behind, nor do I want to really leave my animals for any period of time.

I would trust them with J, but he has enough, I don't want to overload his herp community. I could send the Cresteds to Jen for her to take care of, but I know she can only keep a certain amount of animals, and I don't want to inconvenience her. Besides, she's done enough for me already. Whether she thinks she has or not. 

I can't send the leos to cor, he's moving. I don't want to send them to Beth, nor Mur, they have enough leos. 

So who? I wish Carlee still lived here. She would love to live in my home and take care of my animals for a month. She was awesome about feeding them and misting them etc. I miss Carlee...I really really do.

I can't ask Lex to do that, she has a heavy work load already. I couldn't go to my parents and ask that either....they are too busy.

Well, that's all I had to get off my chest. Asides that when I went to visit we saw blue rams.

I just have to double check their water requirements and if they are compatible by any means. 

I also picked up a book on Dwarf Cichlids which was weird, cause I was thinking of making a cichlid tank, then...whoa...this book is the first thing I see.

Then I go back to work and magazine I picked up..about the cichlids I like, cories, and plant info. Like..I'm on some sort of fish finding info streak..."

"event","Alright, I promised some friends I'd go pick up some RETF's off of my Buddy J as soon as I could get down and see him . Turns out he's out of them right now, so I may have to give up mine. But that's okay, that would free up the 25 gallon..

I was just asked if I would lend out my Dumpy Frogs for a show pilot...the guy is coming to get em tomorrow...

Well I dunno...Oh well, I guess I may be meeting Brad tomorrow when he comes to pick up the frogsies. He wants to trade his Scarlet Macaw for my small parrot. But come on, their not of equal value here, that isn't fair for him, besides, a Scarlet macaw could tear me apart if it was pissed off. My little guy can't do that really...well, not THAT quickly.

Though I'd switch for a week, that would be fun.
I understand why he'd want to though, he's got a wife and kid, and a macaw around a child isn't the safest of things. Specialy with their jealousy issues....

oh well..."

"event","Now I've got tank fever, I've already upped to two tanks in my room. (These are FISH tanks for once, yes, I finally got fish again)...and the one in my kitchen. Now I want a cichlid tank, I like the Bolivian Rams, they are pretty nice. Soooo I'm thinking about it. But this means I'll have to boot the red eyed tree frogs out of the 25 gallon I JUST finished setting up for them, and put them in the 55 gallon downstairs. I doubt they would mind. I could use that tank upstairs as well (the 55) and set it up in my room. But that would be a LOT of work, concidering its a tall tank as well...gravel vaccuuming would include submerging myself in the tank itself*LOL*
or I could be smart and get the extended ones....

But then again, I'm not known for being very logical. Plus having to drag that tank and stand to my room would be a pain in the rear, as would the fact that there would be an empty corner in the herp room.

Ahwell, tis life...

"event","Alrighty, I saw Jordanna's play. It was pretty darn funny, I've gotta admit. There was one chick in there that was freaking GORGEOUS, I swear if I was a guy I would have creamed my pants *LOL* sorry, I'm blunt. I must admit I admired her beauty, no she wasn't big chested, she was slender, but her face was the peak of perfection. Don't get me wrong, Jordana is absolutely adorable too, and I'd love to have either of their faces.

But I found out that that girl was a bit of a b-i-t-c-h later on. So , she then appeared quite ugly to me from then on. (I base a lot on personality)....

Well anyways, I got another female betta, she doesn't look like the first. Looks like a pale imbellis, but two stores can't be selling imbellis as female bettas. So maybe...there is a similarity anyway. I figure this new one would be better for Citrouille(male betta) because her pale colourations would bring out the tan in his fins, maybe bring it to a lighter shade in his offspring. 

The first female, I'd rather find a good red male for since she's got a nice red body. Not that most of you would care...

These clothes are too restricting, I gotta get my pj's....

So, I'm stopping this now

"event","Well I'm waiting to go see Jordanna's play again tonight. Ross, Michael and Carrie should be here to pick me up within the hour. (Along with some new fish*lol*)

Ry came in to work today, stayed for quite some time talking to me. He wants me to go to the gym with him on Monday...
And this is just weird...even Manda was like...""Why is he here?""


I got in an argument with Chris the other day. He was getting too involved in my life, he has some big issues with Derek. And I'm like ""Look, Derek was like a year ago alright, I had fun, that's all that matters."" Who asked him his opinion anyway... I'm not exactly proud of it, but he was good for me. Brought me back some aspects of my heritage, and we went out and did some fun (non harmfull things) like taking the quad up into the mountains. Would he rather that I had been hanging out with my drug oriented friends? Come on here...I don't talk about his personal life, he can stay out of mine. 

Ah well, now that that's out of my system.

I'm so annoyed with this car issue. I can't get one till September now, and I was supposed to pick something up in the states before the fall Calgary show. I don't want to disappoint Jen either if I can't make it down there, but I'll try my best, no matter who I have to beat up.

Ry made an offer to drive me, but I don't think he should be trying to get close to me right now, because I know what he's trying to do. And it just won't work...

Besides, I don't think him and Corey would get along one bit. Coreys jokes about marrying me, and Ry's jealousy issues over someone he doesn't even have may turn out to be problematic. 

Darn, have to feed the 'kid' before I go, as well as all critters. Cause I have a feeling this play is going to put me to sleep -snickers-. Crud, I hope Jordanna doesn't ever read that. She slaps me enough as it is...and I'm serious. It hurts!!!

She's lucky I don't smack her back cause I'm afraid I'd break her. J/K. I don't like to hit really...

Anyways, I'm going to read a bit more of my book while I wait for my ride.

Crud, I had a new quote I thought up today I wanted to write down before I forgot, but DANGIT...
Stupid memory..

I bed I'll remember it in the middle of the play too -snicker-

OH!! I saw the CUTEST puppy today...and it LOVED me. It was sitting all politely next to its owner, then locked eyes on me and headed to me. Then I went to it, asked if I could pet it and it was all over me. The owner was so shocked she's like ""He LOVES you!, I can't believe it, you're so good with him""
I wanted to steal the puppy right there! It had the most angelic face I've ever seen!

Then in came a pug and ruined my day.. (SO kidding, I like da pugsie toby, he's a troublesome sweety...no offense if Karl ever reads this).

oh crud, I forgot I was off to do other things
See ya

Lex wants to go white water rafting again, which would be fun. If I can get the time off work, I'm all for it. I love doing out door stuff, I miss it. Finally I have someone to go out and be wild with again...

I met Rocky today, he's so cool. Rocky is a cockatoo, he's so wicked. Jill was showing him to me, it was hilarious. He laughed like this ""Ha ha ha haaa"" and waved to me with a ""hello"". I got to hold him awhile and play with him...it was pretty cool. One crazy but gentle cockatoo, I must admit, I almost wanted to take him home. But I know how demanding a cockatoo is care wise...and I'm not ready for that yet. I've already got the mini zoo...

The tank is running great, I have to pick up some frozen food tomorrow though. And I'm writing this here so I'll remember it later.

J is bugging me about a visit, but I told him next week. I might be able to make it out there...and C still wants me to visit, but I haven't the time to drive all the way to Camas right now.

"event","Just so you know
My store does NOT sell dogs or cats (for that person that claimed it did) because there are far too many that need homes, so we support adoption agencies. But if we did, man would I ever investigate the potential owners. 

And I'm the same with cichlids, they are a smart, yet aggressive fish. If you can't manage their requirements, you can't have them.

I'm picky with anantids's too, and I won't even let some people have goldfish cause they can't manage em

(BTW, Jen, man came in, 3 goldfish, one bowl, one betta......mmm.....1 goldfish died, betta not doing so well..yet he insists he can have another goldfish and things will be fine...after long talk...I think he finally understood why that doesn't work at all.)

I don't care if it's fish, a rodent, bird or reptile (which is ALL we sell at this store, asides stock). I give every person the third degree (I think thats the term) before any sale. I even send them home with books and tell them to see me in a month if it's a higher maintenance pet. And bring them through the care and requirement drills. I am ANAL about pets...
Simply because I've done enough rescues to see what some people do to them.

Why haven't I quit my job? Because I love animals. I may blatantly dislike some customers, simply because of their disregard for life. But I adore the other customers who honestly care about their pets. Those customers bring the biggest smile to my face. And I've made many friends through my job because of my appreciation for those who actually care. 

So in short, I love my job because of the animals, the constant learning process, and the acquaintances I make as I go along, as well the smiles of recognition when someone comes back that I've helped previously. Whether it be that I've made their tank finally work out, and their fish thrive, or I've helped them construct and entire habitat for their exotic pet. 

The only thing that enrages me about my job, is when people don't even BOTHER to make their animal's life happy. Who refuse to accept anything I say, and who call me a bitch because I decided not to sell them an animal because I believe that they are an unsuitable owner.  Quite frankly I like a job that gives me some sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. And if you have an issue with my occasional venting, then don't read my journal, plain and simple.

Hope everyone has a great day

"event","Ok, I talked about her before, and I'll talk about her again.
Same lady
red zebra or bumble bee (an AFRICAN cichlid)
in ten gallon tank
Well, she put an oscar in there with it, course the oscar died.
Anyways, I told her then that she couldn't keep anything else with it unless she got a bigger tank. And even then it had to be an african cichlid, about the same size, and we'd still have to discuss species.

Well, while I wasn't around, she made someone get her another cichlid, and a pleco...ok
now, plecos don't go in ten gallons, they get up to 18 inches long (thats common sense!).
And having a second cichlid in there means death.

Well, the older one chased the new cichlid around until it croaked then turned and killed the pleco.

She came to me, and said that either M or D told her she could keep them in the ten gallon. Now that's BS, I know my co workers, they would never say that that was ok. 

So I confronted her, and told her that no one on our staff would have said that. If they said a pleco was ok, they meant they'd be ok in a larger tank with hiding areas. And I only told her that other africans can go with it if she got a much larger tank...so anyways, I caught her in her lie. So she backed down, and I gave her credit for the fish. Then told her no more fish, because they'll all just die, and that she needed to study cichlids before delving into them. Since cichlids are unlike any other fish you keep, they aren't your basic tropicals, who don't care who you throw in as long as they are docile. These are territorial fish, who have different requirements then any other fish we sell.

Now I love my cichlids, and am very cautious of which people can have them. I know I shouldn't deem myself the person to judge, but who else will?"

First off, they've come in before, they treat us like crap.
This is a short oriental couple (shorter then me!) I've nothing against orientals, I'm just saying they are an oriental couple who barely speak english. 

Man comes in, points ""I want that fish"" (cichlid, an african cichlid, jaguar??? can't remember) and I'm like
""Do you have a cichlid tank sure""
""yes, it doesn't matter, get me fish""
""Um....how big is the tank""
""It doesn't matter""
""WHAT size is the tank""
""big tank, doesn't matter, 20 gallon""
""Um...how many fish""
""What?""
""HOW many FISH do you have in there""
""Get me that fish""
""HOW many fish do you have in the tank""
""Seven""
""Seven CICHLIDS???""
""Yes""
""You realize these get up to 6 inches on average each (of the tank species he was pointing to)""
""They small, get me fish""

That's when Carrie stepped in, she saw THE look from me...she got him the fish. Then she ended up asking him questions, she saw my look, and she refused any further sale.

WHAT an idiot!! Cichlids get huge, he's going to get a big death rate pretty soon...-sigh-

Now I know two distinct ways of keeping cichlids, there is the crowded way so they can't claim territories...and the big open tank way where they can all have their personal space.

Now the crowded way isn't exactly healthy for the fish, and they didn't mean THIS crowded, cripes this is CRAMPED!!!!

The second way is better, as long as you monitor who is doing what. 

But the problem with this couple is, they only think of animals as ornaments. They've shown this attitude towards numerous other pets, and I want to smack them upside the head. They have a blatant disreguard for any life asides their own.

If they come up with a fish return tomorrow, I'll refuse them if they want more fish. 

And I'll tell everyone else to do so as well.

Stupid idiots
IDIOTS I tell you"

Here's just a short one
Man has small ecclipse tank, maybe 3 gallons
has a paradise gourami in there and some other stuff that the gourami already harasses.
And he wants to put a betta fish in there.
First off, Betta and Gourami are from the anantid family, both labyrinth lunged, both are male in this case, and both aggressive species.
So, this means, when you put em together, in small environment
one will kill the other.
Does man understand? Of course not...not untill I explain like 5 times over...

ugh people...

Oh and get this, 
Woman comes in with her family, buys tons of fish, then while Manda is bagging their fish, the woman looks over to see the birds and says
""This makes me so sad, birds should be free, flying in the trees, not in cages"".
I'm thinking ""Hypocritical wench, think about it, fish should be swimming free in water, not your tank. Those birds are all captive bred, unlike some fish species that ARE wild caught. So they have no clue what nature is like, and the birds natural environment is being destroyed . So where the heck do you expect them to live? Hell some species only exist captively now because we've destroyed their natural environment you stupid idiot...""
But I kept that to myself.
Besides, if you keep the animal properly they will be happy, to the point that you'll be told they are utterly spoilt.
(Like mine)

so she can kiss my tuckus.

Not that I don't agree that many animals are better off free, but untill we start making changes and preserving their natural environments. I'm sorry, but they are safer in homes in some cases."

"event","Ross and Michael just stopped by to sign some papers for me. 

They wanted me to go to the pub with them and Andrea, but I didn't feel like it. Skin feels like its burning, so I'd rather not.

Ross keeps insisting to go in my room to see the tank, but until I finish cleaning and designing my room, he's out of luck.
(Ever since I moved, I haven't organized my room, it's quite the tornado scene right now, pretty bare otherwise too.)

They said that at some store they were at, they sold female bettas. So I figure I could get some of those, but then again, do I want more females? Though I'll be setting up another tank in my room again. I question, stick to tens, or get a 20?

I could keep the females in a community tank if I wanted to, so I don't think there would be a problem there. Hopefully, asides that, you can keep bettas in fairly petite tanks, so space wouldn't be too much of an issue. 

There is a stand at work that we used behind the wall, since it's pretty used and stained with meth.blue I figure I could maybe get it pretty cheap if I bartered, and put it in my room. Lex and I could paint it up. I figure some burgundy and forest green is in order. Rather then that stained white and blue.

I don't mind iron rod either, nor does Lexy. So she would like it...

I can't wait till my scanner is up and working again.
It's being such a cow right now..."

"event","So I've noticed how much I miss Lex (she works way too much*lol* as do I) and John. Two people I need a little bit more of in my life....

And I've realized that driving for two hours and a half in a sleeveless shirt makes your shoulder damn red as well as makes the left side of your face feel like its on fire (in sunny summer weather of course).

Lex and I think it's funny. Cause we both want jeeps (though I have a few more choices as well), she wants yellow, and I want blue. She thinks our driveway would look pretty sweet like that. I'm just thinking ""4x4 trips all the way baby!!!!""

I still have to go on my trip to the interior with Johnno and a few other buds. But that means I gotta get someone over here to take care of my lil boy. And no one wants to take care of the noisy one -lol-...well he's got a bit of an attitude. But that's his issue, not mine. Put him to bed, and he shuts right up...after an hour *lol*. J/K

If you don't know who 'my son' is, you shouldn't be reading this journal. Because you obviously don't know me that darn well. (ehem, take me off your friends list too while your at it...hint hint..unless you are on mine of course*lol* then I like you).

Darn this burning flesh feeling... 

Shane is upset with me*lol* he made the mistake of giving me an opening for a sick joke, now he's got a new nickname, but so do I. Equal trade off....

Ah, my baby wants some more blueberries... I think he should go and get em himself. Or call aunty lexy to give them to him, momma's too lazy right now. Working 8 hours, then driving just doesn't make me feel good. 

I'm worried about the betta, but then again I'm paranoid. They tend to get funguses too easily for my taste, and I see something on her mouth, and yet I see nothing. I think she probably just ate some of the algae off one of the bacobas. 
I'll treat her just incase...I call her a her cause she's supposed to be a female betta. But she looks too much like the imbellis species more then a female splendid... *knows only Jen will get what the hell I'm saying*.

But then again, I don't find many photos of female betta splendids. So I should find them to do comparisons.

I wish I had my camera to show you what she looks like (and show off her tank) but I don't have the digi cam (asides making Ryan return the other one. Sorry, but a bf buying me something that expensive made me feel bad, specially when I was having doubts.) 

Oh, I've also have to admit I've become suddenly more interested in fish husbandry. I know my fish fairly well, but now I'm much more enthralled since I've started keeping fish again.

Though I should get back to keeping my other critters...
ah well

Every time I try to move forward, and leave things behind that were holding me back, they seem to always come back and haunt me.

There were certain people I tried to cut out of my life because all they were doing were bringing me down emotionally and making life a living hell, and yet they keep coming back. Heck they even found my LJ. Maybe next time I won't have it under this nickname *lol* mental note, next time I want something remotely private...don't use a nickname I've had for six years. 

-glares at the bird who is being an arse-

Mental note...get a muzzle for the parrot as well.

Other note, I need more sleep.

I can't wait till Lexy comes with the fish...

Nor till I can go visit John, I owe him a few visits actually. I've bailed the last few times. Maybe he'll let me drive the 'wannabe truck' this time...nah, it's standard, I'd kill us all.

Sightings of the unicorn have been reported from all over the world, even in these modern times. Unicorns are pure and incurruptible. In China, unicorns symbolised gentleness, good will, and wisdom. Christianity links the unicorn with Christ. It is said that unicorns would only allow virgin girls to see them, let alone touch them. They were easily lured into fatal ambushes by a virgin with some potchers waiting for the unicorn in nearby bushes. A unicorn's horn was a highly prised possesion, which was reputed to have great healing capabilities. With the touch of its horn, a unicorn could bring back a person who had been dead for several hours. But when disattached from the unicorn's body, the magic was suggnificantly reduced and could only protect against poison. The unicorn had the body of a horse, a unique spirling horn, and a lion's tail. They were pure white in color. Congradulations, you are a rarity amoung mythical beasts. There aren't enough of people like you in the world.<br>

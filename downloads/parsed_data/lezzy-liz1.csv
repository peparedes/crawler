As you can tell,&nbsp;&nbsp;I dont really write in here that much...&nbsp; Just because of my very hectic schedule.. I work full time and plus i dont have a computer at home... So every now and then I go to my parents house to use their's. Like you care.. Right?&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>&nbsp; Not that much is new with me... I work a long shift *ten hours* and now my back and feet hurt like a mother fucker.&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>&nbsp; &nbsp;Just so you know......... I have a *kinda* girlfriend...&nbsp; Her names Erin and she's 20.&nbsp; She is the best thing that has happened to me yet.&nbsp; You would not believe how good she is to me.&nbsp; She is my closest, dearest friend and also shes my roommate. I bet your wondering how that is going. Actually very well.&nbsp; Sure we've had our spats or whatever but thats just because we live together, along with another female.&nbsp; Now talk about a bitch... This chick also brings home ALOT of guys. Sure shes pretty, but i mean really do you have to be a whore?&nbsp; Can't you be pretty and not be a whore.....&nbsp; Dont get me wrong.... I've been thru my whole slutty stage.... I guess everyone does....&nbsp; I have to admit im a tidbit jealous of her.&nbsp; I really shouldnt be, i have it made...&nbsp; But she has this REALLY awesome boyfriend, and she makes ALOT more then i do and shes able to go out and drink whenever she feels like it. But anyways why am i talking about her again???? Sorry.......</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways new topic... Well its a saturday nite and im not out with friends... kinda a drag...&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>&nbsp; My friend kate and i are supposed to go to&nbsp; Mobile for a week... i kinda need it.&nbsp; I sometimes feel like Erin is smothering me. I cant help it... as good as she is... she has one problem. Shes tooooooo FUCKING clingy... and the thing is... she knows it. She says ""I'm sorry im so clingy"" and then she'll move closer to me... Sometimes i think that if she touches me one more time im going to EXPLODE!&nbsp; But i bite my tongue and say nothing... Sometimes when i do tell her that i need my space she gets all sulky and shit.&nbsp; Kinda pisses me off... SO yeah i havent made up my mind about going or not. I really dont have the money too.&nbsp; But i really need to spend time with someone else other then Erin.&nbsp; AH, just to have some space................. Sorry ya'll i just had to get some things off my chest.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>

Its great..&nbsp; We're all getting along great!&nbsp; We're thinking about moving to nashville if i get a job at a zoo.. How kick ass is that?&nbsp; This is the second time Ive moved out and i think it will be the last. I hope so!

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#663366 size=6>W<FONT size=2>hat got me thinking about working in a zoo is... Emma and I were drinking one night and we were talking and she mentioned the idea of working in a zoo... The idea never occured to me before and I couldnt believe that i hadnt thought of it before... But that would be the perfect job for me! I mean PERFECT!&nbsp; I love all sorts of animals and taking care of them and playing with them would be so incredibly awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; The more i think about it the more i want to do&nbsp; it... But what if i couldnt get into the nashville zoo with out some experience? Thats probably how its gonna be. Oh well... im sure ill figure something out.&nbsp; That would be the most ideal job for me...&nbsp; Okay enough about that. </FONT></FONT></STRONG></P>

I dont say anything at work that i dont want getting around... Even when its about a manager... People just have some big mouths.&nbsp; Its so weird because the managers act all cool and stuff.. but then they will go behind your back and tell the other managers what&nbsp;you said about them.&nbsp; So yeah i dont run my mouth to bad at work... lol... But Dana already knows that i despise her and that everyone thinks shes a bitch... i actually think it bothered her to begin with... but now i think she likes keeping her rep as a bitch.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#330099>&nbsp;Right now Im listen to the gentle noises of the washer and dryer. Wanting to go to sleep.. but i still have 2 loads to go.&nbsp; I'm very tempted&nbsp; to put everything together and just go ahead and get all done in one big load... Wait.. that didnt quite sound right.... But anyhow... yeah... :D</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#330099>&nbsp;Today I was off of work because its my birthday and then&nbsp;I was leaving to go to Orlando.. And oh, now that I'm thinking about it.. I DO need to meantion *just for the record* Dana DID admit to missing me while&nbsp;I am gone! I was very surpised! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#330099>&nbsp; It was a great bday...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG><STRONG><FONT color=#330099>My Girlfriend, Erin , took me out to dinner.. We went to Olive Garden.. It was soooo yummy!!! Then we went driving around and looked at big houses.. that was fun.. THen she took me to a friend of ours and they threw me a surprise party! It was like one of those Birthdays out a movie! It was THAT perfect! Erin came in to pick me up with a dozen of red roses! *Joe&nbsp;has&nbsp; given me only one red rose the entire time we have been together! and at the time... He only gave it to me because i think he got jealous at the club... but he never gave a red rose until i was about to break up with him . There where even times that I gave him a rose! But he never got the hint and got me one. SOME boyfriend.. huh?* Ok NO this is not a Joe Bashing Journal Entry, tho it might sound like it. MMMM I kinda like that... I'll write one that is the Joe Bashing Journal Entry.. Dedicated to ALL assholey men!!!! GREAT(!) idea!!! *pats herself on the back*</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#330099>&nbsp;Okay, I have to te'll ya'll this funny story! Saturday night I went to the gay club *Upscale* with Erin... Welllll.... I run into a friend of mine *Jennifer* &nbsp;that I used to work with. WELL..... I had a friend *Christy*&nbsp;with me who also knew her.. * Christy does not like Jennifer.. AT ALL! Not only that but Jennifer told every one we were working with at the time that i wanted to do her.. *I didnt* So I was like ooh lets go introduce my girlfriend to her... So i walk over there and had Erin by the hand and Christy was kinda staying hidden just to see Jennifers reaction. She had her back to us doing a shot.. so after realizing that she probably could hear us screaming her name i tapped her on the back. She finally turned around and met Erin... She was really polite and everything until her girlfriend turned around and saw me... She just walked off with Jennifer following like a puppy on a leash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After i had left.... she asked Christy if i had left.. when she said that I&nbsp;was gone, Jennifer told her that i had been hanging all over her. And i was touching her, grabbing her ass... AND Christy knows better then that because she was with me the whole time I was there.. So she knows damn well that that didnt happen.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#330099>&nbsp;Well its REALLY late and i have to get up REALLY early!</FONT></STRONG></P>

SO sorry!!&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;My friend *Nicky Poo*&nbsp;tells me that I should talk about him and how wonderful he is,.... And considering im Lezzy Liz... it would be hilarious! Anyhoo.. Lets get one thing straight.. Im bi.. not a TRUE lezzy.... I like men too much... but then&nbsp;I LOVE girls! Alot of people will look down at me and tell me that im gross.. well for all the people who are thinking that reading this... KISS MY NICE TANNED ASS! *yes my ass is very nicely tanned*&nbsp; It started when I was 10 or 11&nbsp;when i first realized that I really shouldnt like other girls..... I even fought it for a while.. Until i was 15 when i made out with my best friend at the time and she cried after she got off.. Not bothering to return the favor! We stopped talking about that time... And i later found out that she told her mom what we did... the bad thing is.... she was 17!&nbsp; You wouldnt think she'd be that dumb! but she was.. ohhh well! Life goes on! Right?&nbsp; Since then ive had random sex with different girls.. And lost my virginity when I was 16. Then&nbsp;I</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I liked it both ways! Nothing wrong with that...&nbsp; I personally think that bisexual people&nbsp; have the best of both worlds! But anyways enough about that subject..&nbsp; I want to talk about my new female.. Her names Erin.. She is my best friend who is bi curious.... We're taking it slow... and i hope to God that i dont scare her off too..&nbsp;&nbsp; Incase your wondering... i do have a boyfriend... we've been together for almost two years now... He is the best boyfriend i have ever had... *we're living together* But for some reason.. i cant help thinking that there is more that i want... He started talking about the M word! *gasp!*&nbsp; Sorry im only 19 years old! I dont want to settle down yet.. im JUST now getting into the party thing....&nbsp; I want to HAVE FUN! I feel like i have my whole life ahead of me... I dont want to end up married with three children at the age of 26..... I want to go out and not have to worry about what my children are doing and if they are behaving for the sitter... ANd when Joe *the boyfriend* talks about marriage.... its a total turn off! ANYWAYS!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;IT is now time for a paragraph for Nicky Poo! *ahem*&nbsp; Theres this guy.. ANd his name is Nicky Poo! Well he's the best EVER! you should meet him!&nbsp; He's such a cutie and hes so incrediby SWEET! *except when he calls you a cunt or twat or bitch or whatever male shovenist pig name he can think of!*&nbsp; But hes GREAT!&nbsp; He has this very special talent of making you laugh.. EVEN when you want to choke him after hes called you by one of his sweet nicknames! Hes the best in bed..... hes sooooo good at it that you keep comming back.. begging for more! Never wanting to stop making love to Nicky Poo! *Hows that Nick?* </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;OK im going to make this my last paragraph.... Ive talked about things ive wanted to get off my chest ... except this one last thing.... My job... I work in a petstore.... I have been working there for over a year... My new manager is the biggest bitch ever!! I would have a good job there if three things would change.... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; DANA~ she would be fired.. or demoted from Customer Service Manager... NO ONE likes her... she gets everyone majorly piss offed at her.... People have quit becaue she treats them like they dont have a single brain cell in their heads.... You just dont treat people like that! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.) My income.. or the lack of... Im probably the lowest paid person workin in that crummy place ...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.)&nbsp; My position... I wouldnt want to be a manager... but something else then what i am... i feel like im the end of the food chain.. the bottom of the tottem pole~! My friend Ana *17*&nbsp; has a lead postition and is making WAY more money then what i am! How bad does that suck!?! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>&nbsp; Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.. it is now 3:33 am and im going to bed.. night night! </FONT></P>"

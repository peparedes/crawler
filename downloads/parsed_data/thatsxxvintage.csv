So this is my new LJ. I had another one, but I forgot the password to it. + =)
I kinda ""dropped"" my xanga. It was boring & I don't know.
Today we had a half day, which was fun?

1) Spanish- we took a quiz on AR endings. O A AS AMOS AN! & then we played spanish
scrabble or something of that sort. It was actually kind of fun.

2) Math- umm. we learned something, but I don't really care what it was.

3) Theatre- SCORE! TEST & talking. yayayayayay"

"event","About that guy who paid someone to shoot him in the foot so he wouldn't have to go back to Iraq...I'm surprised stuff like this hasn't happened sooner and a lot more often.  As someone who is related to a soldier who has served 3 tours in Iraq, each lasting approximately a year I volunteer to shoot any soldier anywhere he or she wishes to keep them from going back over there.  The military does not offer proper counceling services when these service men and women return home and a lot of them are very young, fresh off Mommy's tit and don't know how to function much less how to cope with the sites and sounds of war.

If you're going to call someone a hero you should treat them like one...not continue to pay these boys and girls (which many of them are) below the poverty line and ship them off to war and smack them in the ass when they come back.  As much as we'd like to think they are, these kids are not machines void of feelings.  America can't compare to the Middle East as far as soldier preparation...those kids over there learn to shoot a gun at 3, they are taught in the womb to do whatever it takes to defend their country...we had to be drafted and enticed with sign-on bonuses and offers to pay for college.

So I say, God bless you if you have chosen to serve in the military and didn't know what you were getting in to.  I used to think that soldiers shouldn't complain about going to war because that's a hazard of the job but the more I think about it and the more I think about how much of a fucktard Bush is, I can't help but feel sorry for these people who are honorably serving their country being led by the stupidest fucker who has ever walked the earth."

I like to think that I am thankful everyday for my blessings and I have dinner with my family (when we're all together) whenever I can.  I guess I'm grateful for the two days off of work every year and with Black Friday, all the neighbors go out early so it's pretty quiet in the morning. lol

We're getting paroled at 3pm so I'm just counting down to quitting time at this point.  Yesterday I had a checklist of what I wanted to accomplish and EVERYONE under the sun interrupted me.  Today it's quiet and I'm almost done with the whole list.  Of course I won't finish the whole thing cause I don't want to overdo it.  I'll run some errands (post office, bank, supermarket) on my way home and then I'll straighten up the house a bit since I'll be home for 4 days...don't want to sit around in a rat trap"

I have revoked <lj user=jemgirl>'s black card for the day...she said she doesn't like grits.  I'll give it back to her tomorrow but she's on probation.

Carry on.
A Concerned Citizen</i>


<b>EDIT TO ADD:</b> I've had a caucus with the black contingency and there's only one person willing to give her a pass for being from up north so unfortunately, majority ruled and the revocation took effect at 11:05am.  I also met with the white people and it seems they love their grits too so they don't want her either...poor <lj user=jemgirl>.

<B>NEWSFLASH - THIS JUST IN - <lj user=jemgirl>'s dislikation of grits has been downgraded to code yellow and her revocation has been upgraded to a warning...the reason?  We've just found what is ""allegedly"" a black woman who...DOESN'T LIKE FRIED CHICKEN!  Once we confirm the race of said woman we will revoke her black card indefinitely, make her get a jehri curl and send her to live out the rest of her days in Upper Mongolia.</b>

I am not Oprah, although I have been in the same room with her and exchanged a sisterly nod of acknowledgement which I will treasure for the rest of my life...anyway...I can't give you guys anything but I can share all my secret favorite things.  Whenever I find something new I'll try to hook ya'll up!  <applause>

#1...this has been on my radar for over a year now but I'm not sure most people know they exist.  If you're like me you're a complete germ-a-phobe who changes their towels everytime the wind shifts, disinfects the house if people even look in your window (airborne bacteria!) and you have a separate cutting board for cheese, meat, chicken, fish and veggies.  Well, no need for all those bacteria infected cutting boards.  Saran makes disposable cutting boards!
<IMG SRC=http://a1468.g.akamai.net/f/1468/580/1d/pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/77085/300.jpg>

#2...Since we're in the kitchen, T-Fal makes cookware with a Thermo-Spot.  It's a heat indicator to let you know when your pot is hot enough to start cooking in.  They also have ergonomically designed handles with little vents you can open instead of leaving the lid cracked and having spillage all over your stove!
<IMG SRC=http://www.t-falusa.com/tefal//database_images/cookware_100/non_stick_cookware/InitiativesNS_img_main.jpg>

#3...<a href=http://www.pilotguides.com/tv_shows/globe_trekker/>Globe Trekker</a> is a series where they tape some random travelers making their way through a country.  It's shown on PBS and they're awesome!!!  A lot of them go way off the beaten path and you get more than a travel guide, you get a lesson in culture, foods, etc.  

#4...<a href=http://www2.lush.com/cgi-bin/lushdb>LUSH Cosmetics</a> has been on my radar for 7 years but with the opening of the NY store a few years ago all of my bathing fantasies came true.  I absolutely love their bath bombs and the karma soaps are to die for.  When I lived in London I used their face masks cause I was able to refrigerate them right away.  I loved them.

#5...<a href=http://www.surprise.com/>surprise.com</a> offers gift idead for pretty much every occasion you can think of (and some you would never think to buy a gift for.  It has a gazzillion categories like dog walker, runner, has a bad back, wrestling fan, etc...the ideas range from the traditional to completely out of the box.  Next time you're stumped for what to buy that special someone or just that person who invited you to their party and you feel obligated to go even though you secretly despise them, suprise.com can help you out.

<close up of me looking fabulous in some trendy duds> Well, there you have it.  My first ever favorite things list.  Enjoy...List #2 coming sometime in the future...stay tuned. <applause>"

"event","That is my mantra for today...it's so funny how life works...you take 10 steps ahead and fall back 20.  I'm just in a not so happy place today.  I'm sure it'll pass and I'm not quite sure how I got here...I'm not exactly sad, not really mad, not happy, not confused, not annoyed, not pissed...I'm indifferent.  I don't really feel anything today.  What an odd feeling.  It's like waiting for the other shoe to drop...waiting...waiting...waiting...waiting...

So I decided that I don't want to talk to Shawn so I sent her an email and told her she'd have to wait until the weekend or send me an email.  I am NOT trying to ""repair"" a friendship with my anytime minutes or over the phone.  She needs to man up and ask me to meet her somewhere or come to my house.  I don't respect her as it is...it would be in her best interest to go through the proper channels.  Now, don't get me wrong...that in no way means I'm ready to make peace with her...I'm just ready to get down with the cutting off in person.  Who knows, I may crack under pressure.  I don't know what will happen, I guess that depends on what she has to say.  I may go wild ape woman on her and rip her hair out of her scalp or I could just say ""fuck off"" and walk away...hell, I could give her a hug and then just never call her again.  I don't like where this could go.

I remembered my glasses today so I'm actually going to get some work done!  I may also be able to catch up on some of your LJ's.  We have a staff meeting this afternoon and I'm not looking forward to it.  Hopefully it'll be a short one.  I was supposed to be in new hire orientation for 2 days (today and tomorrow) so this was REALLY going to be a short week but it got canceled so I have to wait until next month...<b>I WON'T BE NEW ANYMORE!!!  HELLO!</b> haha

I blow dryed my hair last night and I'm having a good hair day...I wish I could freeze my hair like this.

This guy just moved to the desk behind me and his phone has this obnoxious ravesque ring tone (we can change our ringers on our office phone).  I think his phone rings every 5 minutes...<b>HOW ANNOYING!</b>  Pugmeister is here today...staring at me from over our wall...<b>WHAT?!</b>"

"event","I'm trying to get rid of my dog. Most of you have met her, some of you havent. For those of you that havent shes a 2 year old huskey mix. I think she has random lab thrown in there. All white with a little bit of gray around the eyes. Sweet as fucking anything. Please someone take her and love her. She at least deserves that much.

I leave her alone too much, I think.

As for the issue of yesterdays post I decided to just grow up and move on. And by move on I mean avoid relationships at all costs. Ha. But, really. Theres no point in being bitter or dumb about any of it. I guess I just need to realize that I'm not meant to be with anyone. Ever.

Now. All you mother fuckers need to give me a call sometime soon. I'm missing you. 

Thank you for your time. The end."

You have squinty eyes and terrible acne scars. Your face is just generally ugly, but I love your hair. Thats all.

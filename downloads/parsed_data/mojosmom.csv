"event","I didn't do much for New Year's Eve.  I never do, as I'm too old to enjoy going out and getting drunk just because it's 12/31.  And I'd like to avoid people (particular drivers) who think that's a good idea.  So I stayed home, made a nice mushroom risotto, and watched a couple of Thin Man films on TCM.  And here's an odd coincidence!  The answers to the NYT crossword this morning included ""risotto"" and ""Nora"" (as in Nora Charles).  How weird was that?

The Saturday before Christmas, I did something incredibly stupid.  I needed to put something on a high shelf in my bedroom, and instead of getting the step-stool I stood on a chair - a chair that swivels.  Dumb!  Because it moved, and I fell and hurt my back. Fortunately, I didn't break anything, but I had some very colorful bruises and had to go very, very easy in my workouts, and finding a comfortable sleeping position was not easy.  I'm very grateful for the existence of ibuprofen.  Much better now, but I can't believe I did something so idiotic.

Both my sisters were in town for a week over Christmas, and while I like having them here, it was also nice to get my house all to myself again.  We did the usual rounds of the local bookstores, had dinner with friends a couple of evenings, and went to the Art Institute, and the Cultural Center to see the Architecture Biennial.  I took them over to Robie House on one of the days it's closed for public tours so I could show them around without worrying about running into, or being run into by, a tour.  They both left last Sunday, which turned out to be an excellent plan, as Monday was godawful weather.  Sleet and winds gusting to 60 mph.  Cathy, who flew, probably wouldn't have gotten out at all.  Stacey takes the bus, and I'd have been worried about the roads. 

Things have been pretty quiet since then.  I went to see two films at the Siskel Film Center, <i>Gaudi</i> and <i>Sagrada</i>, with the woman whom I'm going to room with on my trip to Barcelona in late October.  I see I haven't said anything about that plan!  Last February, I went to Pasadena with the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust's TravelWright program.  It was incredibly well-organized, and when I learned they were doing a trip to Barcelona and Bilbao, I knew I wanted to go.  It's pricey, though, so I really wanted to find a roommate so I could avoid the single supplement.  I mentioned it to a woman who was on the trip I did to Italy in 2014, and she was interested, so we're going together.  I decided the expense was fully justified by things like ""private after-hours tour of Sagrada Familia""!  Barcelona has long been at the top of my list of ""must go"" places, so I'm excited! 

While I was at the Siskel, I bought tickets for some other films.  I always find their offerings to be either feast or famine, and January is definitely a feast.  I'm seeing <i>A Ballerina's Tale</i> tomorrow, then <i>Rosenwald</i> and <i>Suffragette</i> on Sunday and Monday.  My friend Jeanne gets back from a trip next week, and we've got a couple of other films on our agenda.

Had a lazy day today.  Everything is closed, so I just did some stuff around the house and heated up some leftover meatball stroganoff for dinner."

I didn't read as many books as I thought I would, and it's way heavier on fiction than non-fiction than I would have liked."

"event","Last week, I was out <i>every single night</i> (except Sunday).  Two operas, a board meeting, an event at the Art Institute, the Symphony, and the annual dinner of the Illinois Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  I also gave a bunch of 4th-graders a tour of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home & Studio, and a couple of days later went to their class to help with a workshop on <a href=""http://www.froebelblocks.com/"" target=""_blank"">Froebel blocks</a>.  Over the last couple of years of tour-giving, I have come to the conclusion that 4th-graders are the best age!  They are curious and excited and not afraid to show it.  Give them a couple of more years and they'll be ""too cool for school"", as they saying goes.  Saturday I braved very nasty weather to go to the IACDL board meeting, which I left a bit early to get to my book club (the last of the year).  We got our reading list for next year, and I have already ordered the books that I don't already own, so I'll be all set.

This week, however, it's pretty quiet.  I have nothing scheduled during the day except my trainer today and Thursday (yes, I'm working out on Thanksgiving), and my Gilda's Club group today.  I didn't have any evening events, until I suddenly discovered today that tomorrow is the annual Latke-Hamentaschen Debate, and I really enjoy those, so I'll go.  It's scheduled to start at 7:30, but I know from experience that I'd better get there <i>very</i> early to get in.  My older sister is coming in for my annual Sunday-after-Thanksgiving Open House (I'm spending my days cleaning and shopping for that), but won't arrive until very late Friday night (technically, Saturday morning!).  I did buy some pumpkin ravioli so we can have a belated vegetarian Thanksgiving.  She leaves very late Monday night, so we'll go to a Music of the Baroque concert that evening - Handel's <i>Judas Maccabeus</i>.

I bought a new iMac about two weeks ago, and am still getting used to some new behaviors, like the mouse taking me to prior web pages if I brush it the wrong way! I was way overdue - my old computer was from 2006.  This one has a larger screen, which is nice, and I can actually use some websites with this version of Safari that I couldn't with the older one (yes, Snow Leopard - I told you it was ancient)."

"event","Yesterday, I was getting ready to head out to a community flea market, when there was a knock on the door.  Our management company had sent our maintenance guy out to deal with the air conditioners (moving or covering them) for the season.  Without bothering to notify us!  So I said, you've got to do it before 11:00, because, although I could skip the flea market, I had to be at my AAUW meeting at noon.

So he finished up just before 11, and I went to the meeting.  Then I went to a staged reading of a play called <i>The Amateurs</i>, part of the Goodman Theatre's ""New Stages"" program, which involves development of new plays.  This was basically a play about a 14th-century players troupe putting on the Chester mystery play ""Noah's Fludde"".  I think it's got a good idea, but there was a huge digression in which the playwright talks about his intentions that should be significantly cut.

Then off meet my friend Jeanne to see a French thriller, <i>Le Pont du Nord</i>, which was interesting, but strange.  The film was made in 1981, but not released in the U.S. until a couple of years ago.  Dinner after at one of our favorite places; I had an excellent steak and mushroom pie.

Today I did stop by the flea market (actually twice - before and after I did my Robie House tours), and came away with four pairs of earrings (earrings are my downfall), a pair of loose linen pants, a blank journal, and a beaded evening bag - for a grand total of $23.

My first tour at RH was a mother-daughter book club; they'd read Blue Balliett's <i>The Wright 3</i>.  They were great, and guest relations had said that, if I liked, I could take them to a couple of outside spaces that aren't regularly on the tour (the children's play lot and the front porch).  So I did.  When I had a short break between my tours, the house manager came to the break room and handed me a stack of papers, saying, ""This came for you.""  It was a bunch of thank-you notes from a class I'd given a tour to in the summer.  Lots of art glass-style drawings, and lovely, lovely notes.  So nice!

Tonight I'm going to see Court Theatre's production of <i>Agamemnon</i> for the second time.  I have a subscription that's on preview nights, so I saw it last week and loved it.  They'd done <i>Iphigenia in Aulis</i> last season, and the same actors portray Clytemnestra and Agamemnon.  A woman I know is on the CT's board, and she invited me to the opening night dinner and performance, and I'm thrilled to have the chance to see it again.

Now I'm going to finish the Sunday papers and try not to get overly depressed by how dreadful people can be."

"event","Most important, my health is good.  I've been working out with a trainer twice a week, which means I actually <i>get</i> to the gym.

I continue to volunteer with the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust.  In fact, I do so much that last year I was one of the top ten volunteers (in terms of hours) and am on track for the same this year.  Being on two non-profit arts boards also keeps me busy.  <a href=""http://teatrovista.org/"">Teatro Vista</a> got a grant that allowed us to hire a Managing/Development Director, who is a real dynamo and brings a lot to the table.  <a href=""http://newberryconsort.org/"">The Newberry Consort</a> has some great projects in hand and we are building the board.

Lots of traveling happening.  Last fall, I went on a food-and-wine tour of Piemonte with a group led by my Italian teacher, and just this past September I went to Venice for the Biennale.  That was wonderful!  Saw some great (and not-so-great) art, went to a couple of early music concerts (any given night there, you have your choice of multiple early music events, so I was in heaven!) as well as an opera at La Fenice.  Back in February, I went an FLW Trust tour to Pasadena, where we visited some Greene & Greene homes, and also did some of FLW's textile block houses in LA.  I went to San Francisco for a couple of days first, to visit my sister, who is teaching at a culinary school there.  I got to sample her students' work!  In late April/early May, both my sisters and I went to New Orleans for the Jazz & Heritage Festival, and in late May/early June, I went to New York for my <i>45th</i> college reunion, and not incidentally to see friends and visit museums.  I'm already planning for next year.  I was so impressed with the Pasadena trip that I decided to go on the Trust's tour next fall to Barcelona & Bilbao.  It's not cheap, but they are so well organized and get so much special access (like a private, after-hours tour of the Sagrada Familia) that it's worth it.

I continue to take my Italian literature class, which I find is more helpful now than I think another language class would be.  (I was very comfortable speaking <i>and</i> understanding on my last two trips there.)  There are a number of places in Chicago that have community classes in a variety of subjects, and I have taken two at the Newberry Library this year.  One had the irresistible title ""Let's Go Shopping!"", which was about the rise of the department store and social change in Paris, through Zola's Octave Mouret novels (<i>Potluck</i> and <i>The Ladies' Paradise</i>).  The instructor was a woman who is an art historian who has an interest in fashion as well.  I've just finished a class called ""The Courtier Sings"", which was Italian Renaissance music.

So I keep well and busy, and will try to be better about keeping anyone who's still around here up-to-date!"

"event","I&#39;ve just been very remiss. &nbsp;And very busy!

I&#39;ve been recruited to join another board, that of the Newberry Consort, a local group that specializes in what is now called &quot;historically informed performance&quot;.  

Volunteering at the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust (they&#39;ve just changed their name from the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust) continues, as I give tours at both Chicago&#39;s Robie House and Oak Park&#39;s Unity Temple, as well as help with training new volunteers. &nbsp;I am finding that one of the things I really enjoy doing is giving tours to school children. &nbsp;They are lots of fun! &nbsp;And I was given a very nice compliment, by being asked to act as a house captain for Robie House during next year&#39;s very special <a href=""http://www.flwright.org/tours/allwright2014"">Wright Plus event</a>. &nbsp;The people I work with are quite lovely. &nbsp;Yesterday, it was so cold that no one bought tickets for one of the tours I was scheduled to give. &nbsp;I had to stick around because there were people for the next tour, so the house manager said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you take advantage of the living room?&quot; &nbsp;So I fixed a cup of tea, took my book, and sat there reading and watching the sunlight play with the art glass windows.

Our branch library, the oldest in the city, was once again part of Open House Chicago, and I organized the volunteers for that.

The last few weeks have, as always this time of year, been full of parties. &nbsp;Between my professional organizations, various non-profits I contribute to/volunteer with, not to mention purely social times with friends, I&#39;ve been eating and drinking to my heart&#39;s content, if not my cholesterol&#39;s.

I am hoping to have two new additions to my household after the new year. &nbsp;Meet Teague (on the right) and his brother, Thai. &nbsp;They are a Siamese-tabby mix, and oh! so adorable.

<img alt="""" border=""0"" height=""500"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5476/11353231595_e999408ff9.jpg"" width=""375"" />

One of the reasons I&#39;m not taking them in until next year (other than the fact that I don&#39;t want to bother them with company until they&#39;ve settled in) is that I am leaving town on Monday and won&#39;t be back until Dec. 24th. &nbsp;Didn&#39;t seem fair to bring them home and then desert them! &nbsp;I am going to Cuba for a week! &nbsp;The trip is with the Jazz Institute of Chicago, and we&#39;ll be in Havana for a week, meeting artists, musicians, and dancers, and, not incidentally, enjoying <i>warm</i> weather."

"event","I have just come from the vet&#39;s, where I had to have Lilith put to sleep. &nbsp;I have seen her slow down tremendously over the last few weeks, and at first put it down to old age (she was about 16) and her arthritis. &nbsp;But then she stopped eating and drinking, and she was too weak to walk far without stopping to rest. &nbsp;Yesterday, I took her in, and the vet said her stomach was very distended, and took x-rays, which showed a lot of fluid, signifying either a tumor or organ failure. &nbsp;They kept her overnight to see if IV fluids and meds helped. &nbsp;They didn&#39;t. &nbsp;And she was hurting. &nbsp;So I to made the decision to let her go, and held her and petted her as she went.

"event","<a href=""http://www.westherr.com/evox/stills_white_0640/8778/8778_st0640_046.jpg"">a new car!</a> (That&#39;s not the actual car, just an image I snitched from a dealer&#39;s site.)

It&#39;s a white Prius C 3, hatchback, with a moonroof.

I&#39;ve been planning to buy a new car for a while now, and actually went to the auto show last February to check a few out. I&#39;d pretty much had narrowed it down to this one or a Fiat 500 Cabrio, but decided the Fiat really wasn&#39;t practical. As much fun as a convertible would have been, I&#39;m not a fan of two-door cars and the back seat was insanely tiny. (Now if I could afford <i>two</i> cars, and had a garage, that would be different story.) Frankly, the possibility of getting a hybrid with a moonroof was a huge point in favor of the Prius; that combination wasn&#39;t even possible when I bought my last car!

Then last week I got the sad news that the hybrid battery on my current car, a Honda Civic Hybrid, was on its last legs, no surprise after 9 years and 163,000 miles. So instead of sinking $4,200 into a new battery, I made a down payment on the Prius. (My older sister and I had talked a while back about her buying my old car when I got a new one, but there is no way she&#39;d want to sink that kind of money in a 9-year-old car, either. So I traded it in. Didn&#39;t get a lot for it, but I wasn&#39;t expecting to.)

But, oh my! When you haven&#39;t bought a car for 9 years, the technological changes can be a shock! Not to mention the stack of reading material they hand you. A huge thick owner&#39;s manual for the car (it&#39;s 556 pages! so you get a &quot;quick reference guide&quot; as well), plus a huge thick owner&#39;s manual just for the audio system (another 200+ pages). A warranty guide and a warranty rights notification. A navigation system guide. I think it&#39;s going to take me quite a while to figure all this out. But I&#39;ll have fun doing it. The sales guy paired my iPhone with the Bluetooth system, and showed me how to answer calls from the steering wheel. Ack! <i>Please</i> don&#39;t let me turn into one of those people I currently bitch about!

When I got home, I figured I&#39;d go to the I-Pass* website to add this car and remove the old one. Now, the dealer had transferred my plates. So the site wouldn&#39;t add the new car because the old one, of course, had the same plate #. And I couldn&#39;t delete the old one first, because you have to have at least one car in the account. Fortunately, the customer service person who answered my call told me to just edit the current information, and stayed on the line while I did that to make sure that worked. I had the feeling I&#39;m not the first person who had called with this issue! They should put that info on the site.

By this time, my insurance agent&#39;s office had closed for the day, so I left a message and will talk to them today about that. And, as I&#39;m headed downtown today to lunch with a woman from my law school&#39;s development office (translation: she wants to hit me up for money), I&#39;ll take the opportunity to stop by City Hall and transfer my city vehicle sticker.

"event","Both sibs arrived late afternoon on Thursday. When I drove to pick up Cathy at the airport, my car&#39;s air conditioning crapped out, so I took the car in for service on Friday, another insanely hot day. Fortunately, Stacey drove in, so we were able to use her car (though she doesn&#39;t have air conditioning!). We hung out at home mostly, but went out to lunch and then browsed a used bookstore (shock!) Despite the fact that they&#39;d both given me books for my birthday, I bought some more.

Friday night, we went to Victory Gardens to see Luis Alfaro&#39;s <i>Mojada</i>, an updated version of <i>Medea</i>, set in the Mexican immigrant community of Pilsen in Chicago. It focuses on the idea of exile. It could use a bit of editing, I think. The second act is much stronger than the first, which has a good deal too much exposition. The acting was generally excellent, though.

Picked up the car on Saturday. Of course, having gotten the air conditioning fixed, the weather cooled. Figures!

The memorial service was good, though the retirement home chaplain was recycling some platitudes. Decent attendance, many old friends of my mom&#39;s, of course. Later, we went to dinner with Eila&#39;s family and some friends, and drank many bottles of wine in her memory. Good food, too!

Stacey had to leave early on Sunday morning to be back home by evening. Cathy &amp; I went to the Art Institute. The Japanese print gallery has an exhibition of Hokusai, which was pretty fabulous, and we checked out the <i>Undressed</i> and <i>Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity</i> exhibits, as well as Kara Walker&#39;s <i>Rise Up Ye MIghty Race!</i>. Then we were tired, so we went back to Hyde Park for lunch and a visit to yet another bookstore before I took Cathy to the airport.

The weather was pretty fabulous today, low to mid-70s, sunny, lake breeze, so I went over to the Wooded Island, walked around a bit, and then sat in the Japanese garden there and read a bit. Then I wandered a bit by the lagoon shore behind the Museum of Science and Industry. Astounding numbers of dragonflies were flitting about the plants, and I managed to find one that stayed still long enough for me to get a photo:

"event","Really. It&#39;s not just that it&#39;s in the 90s. It&#39;s humid and stuffy to boot. I dashed to the library earlier today to return a book and renew my card, and, after realizing how bad it really was outside, I nixed my plans to go to an outdoor concert tonight. I&#39;d have been sitting out with no shade, no breeze, and I know I couldn&#39;t have tolerated it for long. So I stayed home with my A/C.

Last weekend was nicer. I had an errand downtown, and had left lots of time due to bus reroutes. Having done so, we naturally zipped there in no time, and I was quite early. But, as always, I had a book with me, so I sat in the Art Institute&#39;s sculpture garden and read until it was time for my meeting. The meeting was short, so afterwards I went back to the Art Institute to see the exhibit <a href=""http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/undressed-fashion-privacy"">Undressed: The Fashion of Privacy</a>, a nice complement to the &quot;Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity&quot; show. I also stopped by the shop and picked up a few &quot;Special Value&quot; books.

It was a bad day for book shopping (or good, depending on your point of view). I got my hair cut, and then went next door to O&#39;Gara &amp; Wilson&#39;s. Everything 25% off, because they are moving to Chesterton, Indiana, of all godforsaken places. I suppose from Doug&#39;s point of view, it makes sense, because that&#39;s where he lives, but for literally decades it&#39;s been one of my favorite used bookstores, and I will miss it terribly. It will come as no surprise to you that I bought a bunch of books.

This is all on <i>top</i> of what I picked up, free or cheap, at the American Library Association convention here a couple of weeks ago. I had an exhibit hall pass from Tim over at LibraryThing, and took full advantage of it!

The sibs arrive tomorrow for a couple of days. Stacey has warned that she plans to bring lots of veggies, so I will exercise restraint at the farmers market tomorrow morning."

"event","I accidentally typed &quot;Sumer&quot;, which is vaguely appropriate since the folks a few blocks over at the Oriental Institute are spending their summer <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/for-its-latest-beer-a-craft-brewer-chooses-an-unlikely-pairing-archaeology.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=1&amp;"">making beer from an old Sumerian recipe</a>.

I, however, have entered the 21st-century. I&#39;ve bought an iPhone, nudged to it by the fact that my previous provider, U.S. Cellular, sold its local market to Sprint, which means my old phone would stop working in a couple of months.

After handling that transaction, I got to the Pritzker Pavilion for about the last half of the Grant Park Orchestra&#39;s open rehearsal for their &quot;Let&#39;s Dance&quot; program. Great fun! Tap and tango and jitterbug. During their break, I wandered over to a concession stand for a hot dog and lemonade, not my usual fare, but I tend to indulge once or twice over the summer.

Yesterday, I lunched outside at a local restaurant near Robie House, prior to giving a tour there. Perfect weather. In the evening, I fought the &quot;Waste of Chicago&quot; crowds and went to a special event at the Art Institute. The curator of the &quot;<a href=""http://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/impressionism-fashion-and-modernity"">Impressionism, Fashion,and Modernity</a>&quot; show gave a lecture, the exhibit was open, and there was a reception in the Modern Wing with French wines and food. Cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e! Yum! Also a cabaret act. The show, which includes some paintings that have never been lent in the U.S. before, is fabulous.

There&#39;s a memorial service next weekend for a dear friend who died a couple of months ago at the age of 90. Her daughter emailed me to ask if I&#39;d say a few words &quot;if you feel inclined&quot;. You better believe I do! Eila was a real treasure and inspiration in my life. I am honored and delighted to have been asked."

"event","This is just a brief post to let you all know that I got home safely late yesterday afternoon.  The strike caused a delay of about three hours on the Amsterdam-Toulouse leg of the flight over, but that was all.  That was nicely off-set by an unexpected upgrade to business class on the Chicago-Amsterdam leg.  (I did not have the same luck going home, though!)

The trip was amazing, and I've just put close to 1,000 photos onto iPhoto, so I will be spending quite a bit of time editing them and uploading the best to Flickr.

I'll write more over the next few days."

Yesterday, I had a long visit to the dentist.&nbsp; She replaced one of my fillings.&nbsp; Honestly, it was <i>only</i> forty-one years old.&nbsp; I&#39;m going back on Monday to have another replaced, which is even older.&nbsp; We&#39;re not sure by how much, as their records go back only to 1968.

And in <i>thrilling</i> news, I got my hair cut yesterday!&nbsp; My hairdresser was happy to see me, but I was even happier to see her.&nbsp; We both like the Charlize Theron look on me: http://www.twylah.com/HuffPostCeleb/tweets/305850884171128833"

"event","Our ""mild"" winter has disappeared with a vengeance, now that spring is just a few weeks away.  We got about 10"" of snow yesterday (yes, New Englanders, I know that's nothing compared to what you've been dealing with!).  It started in the early morning and just kept snowing into the night.  Both things I had planned for yesterday were cancelled by mutual agreement, as was an event for this morning.  I did go out in the morning before things got really bad, just to pick up some produce, but other than that I stayed inside, warm and dry.

What was cancelled (well, postponed, really) today was some additional training for Robie House tours.  There's a young adult book by Blue Balliett, <a href=""http://www.librarything.com/work/720881"">The Wright 3</a>, which involves mysterious goings on at Robie House, and the Trust does a special tour for kids based on the book.  I'm going to do the training to give that tour as well as the regular one.  I've given a couple of the regular tours already, and I am really enjoying it.  One of the perks of doing this is that there is a <i>lot</i> of additional education available, seminars and lectures, etc.  

We had one bad day last week, too, but not bad enough to stop me from going to the Art Institute for a talk about chocolate and the Mayan culture, accompanied by a couple of kinds of hot chocolate, finger sandwiches and cookies.  Yum!

I tried to accomplish some stuff on Monday, but was stymied.  My hair is growing out, so I decided to treat myself to some shampoo from The Body Shop.  But when I got there, I discovered they're closed for renovations and won't re-open until next month!  Then I went to the bank to transfer some funds for the deposit on housing for my trip to France, and they needed one bit of info I didn't have.  So I couldn't do that, either.  (I have the info now and will go back tomorrow.)  I then went up to Gilda's Club, contending with the alternate transit routes, as the Brown Line train, which I usually take to and from downtown to the club, couldn't cross the river as the bridge is out for repairs.  The CTA, however, had free shuttle buses running so it worked out, though on the way to the bus coming back, I was <i>forced</i> to walk past the Anti-Cruelty Society's windows and admire the kitties up for adoption.

Also for the France trip, I've decided to get some tutoring to brush up my French, which I haven't used to any extent in about 30 years!  Ack!  I start next week.  I have a feeling that I'll be mixing up French and Italian.

Over the last couple of weeks, since my last post, there have been a lot of interesting cultural events.   A big <a href=""http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/picasso-and-chicago"">Picasso show</a> just opened at the Art Institute, and I went to a lecture about that.  Two days later, I was back at the AIOC for a curator's talk with Kara Walker, whose installation, <a href=""http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/kara-walker-rise-ye-mighty-race"">Rise Up Ye Mighty Race!</a>, also just opened.

In between, I went to hear Garry Wills talk about his latest book, <i>Why Priests?</i>, over at Seminary Co-op.

And opera!  I got to go to a dress rehearsal for Lyric's production of <i>Rigoletto</i>, which I'm seeing tomorrow.  (Fabulous soprano, not so fabulous tenor.)  Also went to <i>Die Meistersinger</i> on Sunday, which was all around excellent.  It's Wagner's bicentennial year, so the Symphony did a program of the prelude and Act II of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>.  Chicago Opera Theater just did a production of Philip Glass' <i>The House of Usher</i>, which I liked a lot.  The director gave it a homoerotic slant that served the production well.  In the midst of all this, it was time to renew Lyric and CSO for next year!  Time does fly.

My older sister has gotten involved in a new art gallery in Cleveland, which will have its grand opening the first weekend in April, so I'm thinking of driving out for a few days for that.

It's a rather odd coincidence, but before the Pope announced his retirement, I had been reading a couple of papal-related books.  Two were books on the Borgias, and it's been interesting to see how journalists doing their obligatory potted histories of the papacy have been uncritically repeating all the old unsubstantiated gossip.   I also read the extremely odd <a href=""http://www.librarything.com/work/187346"">Hadrian the Seventh</a>, about a failed priest who is unexpectedly elected Pope, by the extremely odd Frederick William Rolfe (he liked to abbreviate his name as ""Fr. Rolfe"", so that people would think he was a priest, but, according to one book blurb, ""his vices were considered spectacular, even in Venice, where he died."").

The Latke-Hamentashen debate finally happened.  It's usually the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, but there was a brouhaha at Hillel, which had always sponsored the debate in the past.  The Jewish fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, took it over, so it was delayed until mid-February, close to Purim.  That, however, did not help the hamentashen; as always, latkes won the popularity contest!

Y'know, if I updated more often, these posts wouldn't be so long."

"event","My Italian teacher&#39;s cousin, who is the president of Slow Foods-Bretagne, is in town, and this afternoon she gave a short talk about the <a href=""http://www.slowfood.com/"">Slow Food movement</a>, and fed us soup. Three kinds, one from the north of Italy, one from the south, and one from the central part. The northern one was panisse, a pumpkin soup, with potato and apple and leek; the southern one was cucc&igrave;a, of chickpeas, corn and wheatberries, and the last was ginestrata, a Renaissance-era soup of broth with Marsala, egg yolk, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg. It was a good day for it, too, because it was rainy and a bit chilly - perfect soup weather.

Saw <i>Motherf***er with the Hat</i> again, because Teatro Vista did an event for potential donors. Reception beforehand, then the play, then drinks afterwards with some of the cast members, including Jimmy Smits, who seems like a really nice guy.

I also saw <i>Teddy Ferrara</i> at the Goodman, a play by Christopher Shinn loosely based on the Tyler Clementi case at Rutgers. Thankfully, it was very nuanced. A lot of the cast was young and not very experienced, and it showed, and the part of the university president wasn&#39;t terribly credible - he seemed awfully clueless for someone who had been a U.S. Senator and was now running a major university. It was worth seeing, but could use some work.

My practice tour at Robie House was successful, and I am now certified and will give my first public tour later this week. Wish me luck!"

"event","FINALLY!!!!!!!

Our neighborhood has been without a movie theater for more than 10 years. I&#39;d have to traipse up to the near north side to see a first-run film. It was such a pain, I hardly ever did. I&#39;d go to the Siskel Film Center, but that&#39;s for oldies, documentaries, art films, film festivals, etc.

Then they started renovating the old theater. It was supposed to open in December, but, this being Chicago, there were permit holdups. But it finally opened today.

This place is literally a five minute walk from my house. And it&#39;s <i>cheap</i>! $6 for matin&eacute;es, $8 at other times. (And as of my birthday, when I turn 65, it&#39;ll be $6 all the time.)

I think I&#39;ll go see <i>Lincoln</i> next week."

My Italian lit class resumes on Friday morning, so I have about 30 pages of Margaret Mazzantini&#39;s <i>Venuto al mondo</i> to read before then.

I have also signed up to volunteer with the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust, so tonight I start interpreter training at Robie House. This is seven sessions, and there&#39;s mucho reading.

So this morning I found myself in the school supply section of Office Depot buying a notebook. It wasn&#39;t weird to buy a notebook. But it <i>was</i> weird to be buying &quot;school supplies&quot;!


Last night, I went to a reading of Dustin Lance Black&#39;s <i>8</i>, taken almost entirely from the transcripts of the federal district court trial in the case of <i>Perry V. Schwarzenegger</i>, which challenged California&#39;s Proposition 8 that banned same-sex marriage. After the performance, there was a post-show discussion, which included, among others, one of the plaintiffs in that case and one of the sponsors of the same-sex marriage bill that&#39;s pending in the Illinois legislature.

The program asks that we share the link to a recording of the LA premi&egrave;re of <i>8</i>, so <a href=""http://www.afer.org/8la/"">here it is</a>. Forward away!"

"event","Honestly, I am going to try to do better at posting regularly.  If nothing else, it will be easier for me to remember what I want to say!

Gosh, I last posted on <i>Election Day</i>!  

Since then, I've been busy.  

SOME CULTURAL STUFF:

I see I've spent a fair bit of time at the Art Institute.  Their new galleries for Greek, Roman and Byzantine art opened in November, and I went to a couple of events around that.  And they had a fun holiday event for donors, with a talk in the photography study room on photographs of snow scenes, and another talk about art from the collection of winter scenes.  All very appropriate and accompanied by drinks and cookies.

In the olden days, before radio and television and computers, people used to provide their own entertainment, often in the form of musical evenings.  I went to one!  A guy I know who is on the musical staff at Lyric Opera, along with a cellist from their orchestra, did a live radio broadcast on our local classical music station.  They wanted to rehearse first in front of a live audience, so some friends opened their apartment, and invited about a dozen or so people over to listen to Bach, Debussy, Stravinsky - it was all so lovely and old-fashioned!

Also various operas.

SEMINARY CO-OP:

One of my favorite bookstores moved right before Thanksgiving.  Seminary Co-op Books, often called the world's best academic bookstore, was so named because for <i>aeons</i> it's been housed in the basement of the Chicago Theological Seminary.  But CTS has a new building, and an economic research institute has moved into the old place, so the University provided a new facility for the store.  It's just a block away, next to Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House, and it's <i>gorgeous</i>.  A lot of folks were sad about the move; Seminary's quirky spaces were much beloved, despite the drawbacks (like lousy handicapped access, no natural light, and low hanging pipes), and there was concern that the atmosphere would be lost.  But they made the right move in hiring architect Stanley Tigerman, who has been a Co-op member for thirty years.  He has designed a large, light-filled space that still has those beloved nooks and crannies.  One of my favorite things are the bookshelf ""windows"":

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/8202787087/"" title=""Bookshelf Window by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8202787087_2cb8eaa614.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""Bookshelf Window""></a>

Two days before the actual opening, they had a ""book parade"".  The store has always what was known as the Front Table (though it wasn't actually in the front), on which were displayed recent books, generally by University faculty, an honor described by one person as ""The Pinnacle of Academic Achievement"".  So they invited the authors to come and move their books from the old Front Table to the new one.   The parade came complete with bagpiper:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/8203873052/"" title=""Piper by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8203873052_4c3945f49f.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""Piper""></a>

Afterwards, everyone enjoyed cookies and tea/coffee/cider/hot chocolate, as well as a sneak preview of the new space.  

More on the move, the store, and how much people love it at the <a href=""http://www.semcoop-project.org/"">The Seminary Co-op Documentary Project</a>.


FAMILY/FRIENDS:

My maternal great-aunt was married for a time to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Rodriguez"">William E. Rodriguez</a>, the first Hispanic alderman in the City of Chicago (and one of two aldermen elected on the Socialist Party ticket).  He was also, back in 1912, the first Hispanic graduate of the law school that I attended, so the school had a reception in his honor, at which it was announced that a scholarship was being established in his name.  I have been asked to serve on the committee that will establish the criteria by which it will be awarded.    Should be an interesting experience; I've never done anything like that before.

An old friend of mine passed away in October.  She had been living in Maine since her retirement about 10 years ago, but still had ties to the area.  There was a memorial service for her earlier this month at the Friends Meeting in Lake Forest, of which she was a member.  One of her daughters, also a friend, was unable to come in for it, but she and her husband and utterly adorable daughter came through town a couple of days ago and some of us got together with them for lunch.  It was so good to see her, and it looks as though they will move back to the area (well, Wisconsin, anyway), which will be nice.

I hope everyone has had good holidays.  Mine were excellent.  I went to scads of parties.  

Also, both my sisters came out for Christmas, and we indulged in art exhibits, bookstores, and seeing friends, including a dear friend of my parents' generation who is now in hospice care.  

I had said that I did not want to get a Christmas tree, as hauling it up three flights of stairs (and back down) and finding errant needles well into July had gotten old.  But Stacey turned up with a tree!  It's a tabletop tree, only about 2 1/2 feet tall, and it smells <i>marvelous</i>.  

OTHER STUFF:

I have been feeding my addiction to outerwear.  Honestly, I have boring black skirts and trousers, and scads of jackets and coats.  There's a great store in my neighborhood called What The Traveler Saw, that has items both for traveling, and which the owner has found on her travels.  Lately, she has also been taking some items of clothing and jewelry on consignment, and recently brought in a guy who sells vintage clothing.  Well, you know I was doomed!  For a couple of weeks, I was salivating over a coat in the window of the store, so one day I went in and tried it on:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/8330272915/"" title=""Cashmere coat, raccoon trim by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8495/8330272915_0d56b4f6ea.jpg"" width=""294"" height=""500"" alt=""Cashmere coat, raccoon trim""></a>

Then a couple of weeks later, while my sisters were with me (and urging me onward rather than the opposite), I found this on the vintage rack:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/8331324950/"" title=""Donald Brooks' quilted tapestry coat by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8501/8331324950_995bd6ed70.jpg"" width=""304"" height=""500"" alt=""Donald Brooks' quilted tapestry coat""></a>

The label says ""Donald Brooks"", so I looked him up.  <a href=""http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/theater/03brooks.html"">Quite the guy!</a>  I was in the store today, and told the vintage guy what I'd found, which he hadn't known.  I bet he's going to Google all his labels from now on.  (Maybe I shouldn't have told him!)

That's probably more than enough from me right now.  

Besides, it's close to time for <strike>champagne</strike> Prosecco."

"event","I was a good girl and voted today. The judicial ballot was annoyingly long as usual, and I spent inordinate amounts of time on the web reading the various bar association and judicial commission reports trying to figure out who to vote for. The one race I chose not to vote in was for our Congressman. The incumbent is someone whose positions I generally agree with. However, he is suffering from a depressive disorder that has required multiple hospitalizations. While I certainly don&#39;t think that illness of any sort should be an <i>automatic</i> reason to vote against someone, in this case it has interfered with his ability to perform his duties, and I was also very unhappy with the way he and his staff handled the disclosure of his situation to his constituents. He had two opponents, one a Republican whose positions - where he actually disclosed them - are the opposite of mine, and the other an independent candidate who can&#39;t put together a coherent sentence. (He also has a really annoying website and misuses quotation marks <i>constantly</i>.) So I sat that one out.

I plan to spend election night watching the returns in the hotly-contested race in 14th-century Genoa between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. (I&#39;m seeing <i>Simon Boccanegra</i> at Lyric.) Also keeping an eye on traffic as the Prez is in town, and what I hope will be the celebration is to be at the McCormick Place convention center, right on my way home from the opera.

Has it really been <i>two months</i> since I posted last? Apparently so. I will not even attempt to say what all I&#39;ve been doing. But a few brief highlights are in order.

Our local branch library, the oldest in the city, participated in the Open House Chicago program, a weekend during which historically and architecturally significant buildings are open to the public free of charge. I organized the volunteers to staff the branch, and had a lot of fun. Then I went and checked out several other places that were open, places that normally aren&#39;t.

Some friends and I went up to Wisconsin a couple of weekends ago to check out the new Sir Norman Foster-designed building at S.C. Johnson company (famous for their Frank Lloyd Wright administration building). We drove by a couple of other FLW buildings in Racine, went to the Racine Art Museum, and then headed to Kenosha to the Kenosha Public Museum and dinner at a very good, upscale Italian restaurant. We had a great, if tiring, time.

This past Sunday, I went to one of the Chicago Humanities Festival events, &quot;The Making of an American Opera&quot;, about the opera Lyric has commissioned based on Ann Patchett&#39;s book, <i>Bel Canto</i>. The composer and lyricist were discussing their collaboration, how the commission came about, etc. All quite interesting. Later the same day, I saw Beppe Severgnini&#39;s documentary <i>Portland 2 Portland: A Political Train Journey Across America</i>. Afterwards, Severgnini and two of the crew talked about the trip and some of the technical challenges of filming on a train.

I&#39;ve also been to a couple of plays, some concerts, and some art exhibits.

Non-cultural stuff: a new coffeehouse opened across the street from me. I can recommend their carrot cake."

"event","A couple of weeks ago, I went to the Chicago Air and Water Show, a big, noisy deal on the lakefront.  Ordinarily, I'd never go, as it would entail fighting crowds on the beaches.  But I was invited to a private event on the Rooftop Terrace of Navy Pier, with lots of yummy food, and far enough from the main action to carry on a conversation.  It was actually quite fun watching the planes and the boats:

This past weekend was the annual Chicago Jazz Festival.  There was a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald at Millennium Park on Thursday, another concert with Latin jazz and Roy Haynes on Friday, and then the main stuff all weekend.  It threatened rain both Saturday and Sunday, and actually drizzled a bit on Friday, so the crowds were not as large as usually until later Sunday afternoon.  I didn't stay late to the Saturday/Sunday evening concerts, but enjoyed both afternoons immensely, as always.

Other than that, I've been reading a lot.  I seem to be on a 19th-century novel kick, having just finished Wilkie Collins' <i>Hide and Seek</i> and being on my third (!) Trollope.  I may move on to Henry James and Edith Wharton after this."

I dashed down the block to the farmers' market this morning for raspberries, flowers and a muffin, and dashed back home about 10 minutes before the skies opened and it started pouring.  It's stopped now, though.

Last week was busy.  Teatro Vista, along with another theatre company called Collaboraction, did a series of six solo shows in three programs, all performed by the playwrights, so of course I went to all three.  My favorite was KJ Sanchez' Highway 47, about her family's involvement in a land grant dispute in New Mexico.  

It should be no surprise to anyone that I am involved in the Friends of Blackstone Library.  In a perfect merger of my love of libraries and my love of architecture, I am working on an event in October, when our library, the oldest branch library in Chicago, will be part of the Chicago Architecture Foundation's <a href=""http://www.openhousechicago.org/"">Open House Chicago</a>.  Should be fun!

Eight years ago, I wrote <a href=""http://mojosmom.livejournal.com/15704.html"">this review</a> of Regina Taylor's play, <i>Crowns</i>.   Saw it again a couple of weeks ago, and, having been to a couple of pre-play events, I knew she'd revised it.  It's rather like she read my review, and fixed what I didn't like!  She made Yolanda's story much stronger and more integrated into the play (and, along the way, moved Yolanda's home from Brooklyn to Chicago's Englewood neighborhood).  Different cast, but all fabulous.

I had my annual fix of Chicken Teriyaki and <i>taiko</i> drummers at the Ginza Holiday Festival Saturday.  I also bought a gorgeous, and rather unusual, <i>kimono</i>.  It's quite simple, brown and indigo (looks black in the photo but it's not), with figures done by <i>shibori</i> dyeing:

"event","My local college alumnae group had arranged to gather at Millennium Park for dinner, conversation and the concert, which was George Fenton's <i>Frozen Planet</i>, music he wrote for the BBC program.  The film was shown while the music was played and Fenton conducted.  

It was an absolutely <i>gorgeous</i> night, in terms of weather.  Low '70s and a very slight lake breeze.  Slightly more than halfway through the program, an unscheduled intermission occurred, so we could all enjoy the Navy Pier fireworks, visible from the Park despite being several blocks away.

Because they needed to wait for the sun to set because of showing the film, the concert was later than usual (8:30 rather than the normal Wednesday 6:30 start), but that was fine as it gave us more time to gab.  About a dozen people showed up, from recent grads to retirees, so quite a range!   I got there in plenty of time, despite a bus detour and lots of traffic, both due to Taste of Chicago, which opened yesterday.  Our driver was blessed with good reflexes, because some of the drivers in the traffic were engaging in some rather dangerous maneuvers, like turning right in front of the bus!  The extra travel time, however, did give me the opportunity to have a nice chat with a couple from Colorado who were visiting Chicago for the first time.  They were enjoying the architecture, and I gave them some tips on where to go and what to see.  (Wearing my unofficial Chicago tourism bureau hat!)

I got home late, though, almost 11:00, and had a bit of a hard time getting to sleep.  So I slept in a bit this morning, and then got a bunch of stuff at the farmers market.   I decided I want to make more gazpacho, so I picked up bell peppers, cucumbers and cilantro to add to the tomatoes I already have.

So later in the morning, I heard some honking in the alley.  I poked my head out, and saw a garbage truck trying to enter the alley for the pick-up.  However, some jerk had left a rental truck parked in such a way that there was no possible way for the garbage truck to get by.   Nobody could find the person who'd left it there, either.  So the police were called, another garbage truck backed into the alley, eventually the first one backed out, went around and backed in.  It was a mess.  The yellow truck in the picture below now has a ticket on the window. Personally, I think they should have towed his ass:

"event","There was a shortened, ""family-friendly"" version of <i>As You Like It</i> in a local park this afternoon, put on by <a href=""http://spectralia.org/"">Spectralia Theatre Company</a>.  Being outdoors, there was no stage, just a backdrop and ""trees"" and ""tents"" made from cloth and wood.   Nevertheless, you'd think that someone would notice those, as well as the dozens of people sitting in chairs and on blankets, not to mention actors declaiming Shakespeare.  Apparently, however, gabbing on your cellphone renders you oblivious to all that.  At least it did to the full-grown adult male who wandered through the Forest of Arden, phone to ear, for all the world as if he belonged there.  Truth be told, because the actors were in regular clothes, were making entrances and exits through the crowd, and kept on with the job as though he weren't even there, for a minute we thought he <i>was</i> part of the show!   Until he wandered off as slowly and casually as he had come.  It was pretty funny, actually, and after the show I congratulated the actors on their professionalism.

The show itself was quite fun, the cuts not detracting.  There were lots of little kids in the audience as well.  It rather reminded me of the days when <a href=""http://www.courttheatre.org/blog/comments/what_is_court_theatre/"">Court Theatre</a> was outdoor summer theatre at the University of Chicago, and our parents took us to watch Shakespeare in Hutchinson courtyard."

"event","<i>Gorgeous</i> moon yesterday!   I was driving home along the lakefront shortly before 9:00 p.m., as the moon was rising.  It came up out of the lake, huge and full and coppery.  Absolutely stunning.

And today -- the transit of Venus!  An event that will not occur again for 105 years, so I guess I'll probably miss the next one.  ;-)    The Adler Planetarium had set up telescopes for viewing the transit, which was visible here from 5:04 until sunset (about 7:30).  I got there early, and checked out a couple of exhibits inside, and then got in one line to see sunspots and another line to see solar prominences.  By then, it was almost time for the transit, so I got back into line to see that ""live"", and then went back in to watch the live NASA feed and hear one of the Adler people talk about the event.  After browsing in the shop a bit, I went out on the adjacent viewing terrace where there was a surprisingly short line for a telescope, so I checked it out again.  I wandered down to the water and strolled along the breakwater, where I found that someone had abandoned a pair of solar viewing glasses.  They were a very hot commodity, having sold out at the Adler's shop very early on, so I grabbed them and viewed the transit that way, too.  It was an excellent evening."

"event","Yesterday, I went to the local garden fair and picked up some herbs, flowers and compost for my back porch container garden.   I left them on the porch while I went inside, had lunch and rested up a bit.  When I went out to plant everything, I was greeted by a lovely tabby cat coming up the stairs.  She looked just like Lilith.  Because it <i>was</i> Lilith!  I <i>think</i> she had pushed open the screen door (I'd left the main door open to let some air in) and trotted her little self outside.  

Note to self:  <i>Latch</i>, as well as close, the screen door in future.

At this moment, Lilith is sitting on the newspaper that I was trying to read.

Cats:  can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em."

"event","Figured I'd better blog about Glasgow and Dublin before I head off to New Orleans this evening!

Both trans-Atlantic flights were alleged to be ""very full"", but I was able to get a four-across row with no other passengers on each.  This was especially good on the flight over, as I could stretch out a bit (despite armrests that don't go all the way up - why do they do this?) and nap.

<lj-cut text=""Glasgow"">Easy transfer at Dublin for the flight to Glasgow, though, as always, the gates were as far apart as they could be.  I took a shuttle into town, and then walked a short bit to the hotel, the Frasier Suites in the Merchant City.  Quite nice, very friendly and helpful staff, good-sized room with a sitting area and kitchenette (though I never used that except for tea), and a decent breakfast.  That night, I went to dinner at the City Merchant restaurant, which specializes in ""fish from the coastal waters and rivers of Scotland""; I had salmon swimming, not in water, but in butter.  Delicious.  I had planned to skip dessert, but was tempted by the description of <i>cranachan</i>:  whipped cream, whisky, honey, and fresh raspberries, with toasted oatmeal soaked overnight in a little whisky.  It was as good as it sounds.

I slept well, and the next day walked up to Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art, having previously booked for the 11:00 tour.
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/7102166359/"" title=""Art by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/7102166359_bda5836798_n.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""320"" alt=""Art""></a>
The guide, a soon to graduate student, was quite informative.  It was interesting to see the similarities between CRM and Frank Lloyd Wright - the Japanese influence; the flow from low dark spaces to bigger, brighter ones; and, of course, the control of the <i>entire</i> design - building, furniture, decoration, textiles.  After that, I went for lunch to the Willow Tea Rooms on Sauchiehall Street.  Tip:  if you have a reservation, you lunch in the Tea Room Deluxe:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/7102185627/"" title=""Tea Room Deluxe by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7102185627_d7b5b61e37_n.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""240"" alt=""Tea Room Deluxe""></a>

After fortifying my innards, I headed to the Hunterian Art Gallery, most of which is closed for renovation, but I was able to see the reconstruction of CRM's home, filled with his gorgeous furniture.  No photography permitted, sadly.

I crossed the street to the University of Glasgow, debating whether to go to the Hunterian Museum, as the posted closing time was 5:00 and it was already after 4:00.  However, a second sign revealed that that night they were open until 7:00, so I went in, and managed to be there for a tour and also a talk by one of the curators about their Ptolemaic gold coins.  The place is fabulous - Hunter was a mad collector, and of course they've acquired loads of stuff since.  There is a new permanent exhibit of bits, large and small, from the Antonine Wall.

I walked back to the hotel and dined at a nearby Italian restaurant.  Very delicious.

Slept badly, that night, though whether that was due to personal worries, too much tea, delayed jet lag, or a combination thereof, I don't know.   So I got up a bit late.  I planned to go to Helensburgh to see CRM's Hill House, but as they aren't open until early afternoon, I was in no rush.  I walked to the train station via an old churchyard, full of ""merchants of Glasgow"", and hung out a bit at the Gallery of Modern Art.  Formerly the Royal Bank (among other things), it now features a statue of Wellington with a traffic cone on his head:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/6961555126/"" title=""Wellington, with a traffic cone on his head by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7064/6961555126_cf75dfeb20_n.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""320"" alt=""Wellington, with a traffic cone on his head""></a>

I'm in love with Hill House:

I wish photography had been allowed inside; it's absolutely stunning.  The living room has a delightful window seat where I would be happy to spend my days reading and contemplating the view.  And my dining room set would suit the place much better than Mr & Mrs Blackie's, as mine is a CRM design and theirs was not! 

That evening I went to a performance by the Scottish Ballet of a new work, based on Tennessee Williams' play, <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>.  It was <i>brilliant</i>.  They made the back story part of the action, which made the narrative clearer than I think it otherwise would have been, and the dancers acted extremely well.  The performance was at the Theatre Royal, which is a pretty fabulous building, too.  </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Dublin"">
Took a cab to the airport, as always arriving with more than sufficient time.  I finished yet another book on the flight, so had more to release once I arrived.  A bus from the airport to Trinity College and then a cab to the hotel, which was quite comfortable.  I was sharing with another Bookcrosser, and we had dinner at the hotel before heading up to the icebreaker and ""craic"".  Lots of books on the book buffet, but I only selected small, thin ones!  A fun evening, with step dancing!

The convention began in earnest the next day, with two local authors, Peadar O'Guilin and Adrienne Hines.  I honestly hadn't expected much, particular from the former as I'm not into his sort of books, but both were quite interesting, and I think I would enjoy Hines' work.  We were supplied with an excellent lunch, salmon for me again, and in the afternoon there was a presentation about the 2013 convention in Sweden (which I think I'll skip) and the 2014 event was awarded to Melbourne.  I'd love to go to that one if I can manage it, though it won't be worth it unless I can spend a good month in Australia and New Zealand.  Fingers crossed.  For dinner, I chose to go to the ""modern Irish"" restaurant, which had lovely food.

Sunday was the flash mob and release walk/treasure hunts.  There were three of the latter - short, medium and long; I chose the ""medium"", though I took the clue lists for all as they seemed to be quite a good guide to city walks.  ""Medium"" took us past interesting architecture, to Dublin Castle and St Patrick's cathedral, and ended at an OBCZ called Accents, where I had a cup of tea and a slice of butterscotch cake that was absolutely to <i>die</i> for.  (I found out later that I had won the treasure hunt, and was given a pretty little silver pocket mirror shaped like a shopping bag - open the bag and there's the mirror!)  After that, I went back to Dublin Castle
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/6951671836/"" title=""Dublin Castle by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/6951671836_1dc788dcb3_n.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""240"" alt=""Dublin Castle""></a> 
to see the Chester Beatty Library, which is a book lover's dream.  Case after case of books and related objects from all over: illuminated manuscripts, treasury bindings, <i>ebru</i>, Japanese scrolls, jade sutras, on and on!  Then I did the guided tour of the Castle, which I recommend but wish it was a mite longer.    Dinner again at the hotel and then off to the pub quiz.  Our team didn't win, but did pretty well.

Monday, Futurecat and I went off to Trinity College, where people were wandering about in academic robes and listening to the announcement of the scholarship winners:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/7097227747/"" title=""Announcemebt of Scholars by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7199/7097227747_2f71b2d952_n.jpg"" width=""320"" height=""240"" alt=""Announcemebt of Scholars""></a>   
Lucky winners, indeed!  Dispensation from fees, lodgings in college, free dinners and a stipend - no wonder everyone was cheering lustily!  We then took a tour guided by a very charming, amusing and good-looking young historian, and then to the Old Library for a look at the Book of Kells.  We followed that with a visit to the Long Library, an incredibly impressive, galleried and barrel-vaulted place where are displayed many of Trinity's treasures (like books printed by Aldus Manutius and William Caxton) as well as early documents relating to the institution itself.

We split up then, and I headed to the General Post Office to release a copy of <i>Agony at Easter</i>:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mojosmom/6948028144/"" title=""Agony at Easter, at the General Post Office by mojosmom, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7253/6948028144_4527929393_n.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""320"" alt=""Agony at Easter, at the General Post Office""></a>
From there, I walked quite a bit, over to Merrion Square to see the Oscar Wilde Memorial (which is a bit tacky, if you want my opinion), but lovely green space.  The National Gallery is right there, so I went in (as seems to be my luck this trip, most was closed for renovations).  I was particularly blown away by Caravaggio's <i>The Taking of Christ</i> and a lovely little Vermeer.  Walked then through St. Stephen's Green to the Iveagh Gardens, which had been recommended as a beautiful, and less-frequented, garden, and it was delightful.  So serene and quiet!  We did the Literary Pub Crawl that night, which was interesting, if long, and I did not indulge, as I was tired and needed to get up early the next day for the flight home.  </lj-cut>

Was able to pre-clear customs at Dublin Airport, which saved time at O'Hare, and Lilith and I were very happy to see each other again."

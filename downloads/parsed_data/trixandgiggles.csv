"event","OMG...i finally sat with Jordan Hatch on the bus today! lol..it was soo weird though. we were both quiet for ever then i was like: ""so whats your name?"" and he was like: ""Jordan...whats yours?"" ""Macy"" ""are you a sophmore?"" ""ya..what about you?"" ""freshman..*starts laughing..*"" ""oh.""
and ya..that was really all we said.! LMAO! but thats ok. cuz i finally got to sit with him and actually have a reason to stare at him! lol
MAN...he is an EFFING HOTTIE up close! 
But i think next time..im gonna sit with Nick Gould! lol..he looks more talkative! no offence to Jordan. but i think i would actually talk to Nick! lol..im such a LOSER!

OK..then Yesterday..i called my little HOTTIE SETH on the phone! lol. that was even more weirder. we didnt have moments of silence thoguh..we had moments where we just laughed! :) it was weird cuz we havent heard each others voices for about 2 years and we ALWAYS talk on MSN not on the phone. and you can say whatever you want on the computer rather than if your on the phone. LOL! 
OK..well, im gonna go..see ya'll later! *CHOW!*"

"event","WOW...i think i just got in the stage where i cant talk about anything BUT BOYS!!!! lmao! there are just sooo many frickin hotties in our school its INSAINE! anybody who knows me and talks to me knows that all i talk about is boys! lol. but the thing is..i dont like having boyfriends. i just like to flirt with guys and thats it!
There are lots of hotties in my Auto class..but i can never get the courage to go up and talk to them, probbly because they are sophmores and im still a freshman.! so i get really shy! 
I think im actually ready to become a sophmore now. im so sick of being the little freshman on campus. and plus next year..we get to tease all the little freshman.! YHESS!!!
Shiloh..im so excited that you asked Carson. and he is a loser for not answering you! dont worry about him. he is just a guy. guys are always shy and dumb! he probably isnt answering you because he likes you and doesnt want you to know it! LOL!
Man..i really want to ask Nick Gould or Jordan Hatch to MORP! but i dont really know them...so ya, thats not gonna work!
ok..im gonna go! *love you guys* BYE!"

"event","ok...so yesterday i went to the movies with Amanda, *and someone else* and well...it was pretty funny! so here is the story:
we were watching the movie..and then *someone* put his arm around me..and then kinda cuddled with me through the whole movie..and we were really *close* and i felt so weird. and ya! so then at the end of the movie, he was like: Lets make out- or something like that! it was SOOO EFFING HILERIOUS. so then, i looked at *him* and then he just went in my mouth! haha! so we were making out for like 15 minutes! even aftr the movie was over..during the credits.! and Amanda said people were walking by and looking at us! LMAO! thats embrassing!

So after that..i got home and got on AIM..and *he* was on, he he was like: ""so i guess we're going out now right?"" ""will you go out with me?"" and i was like saying EVERYTHING i could so he woulndt want to go out with me. cuz he's cool and everything but i dont like his friends and they dont like me..so i would feel uncomfortable around them!  so then he was like: ""ya so i thought tonight was the night to see how we were together..and it was awesome."" and i was like..""i dont really like the whole boyfriend girlfriend thing..im a major flirt and it wouldnt work out.."" and he was like: ""well..if we go out, you can still flirt with other guys."" ok now thats just WEIRD! so then he said..:""so you just go and make out with hott guys and then leave them? i dont get it!"" and ya..thats really the story...and he was like:""ok..we can go out and if it gets too weird, we will break up.."" and i was like:""ok! 

so now *we* are going out!! LMAO! i am so nervous to go back to school! lol.. oh and by the way everyone...i dont have AIM anymore..again...IT SUX!

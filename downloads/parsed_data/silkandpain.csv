"event","My fetish feels like a drug addiction sometimes. I get the need for a ""fix"". Its usually supplemented with porn, but sometimes, that just doesn't feel enough.

My fetish used to feel like a dark, shameful secret that I was scared to tell anyone. Somewhere along the way, I got brave and just started letting people in on it. I was tired of the power it had over me. Along the way of totally divulging my fetishes to my friends and the world, I was hoping I would encounter enough curious souls who were intrigued by the thought of kicking someone in the nuts. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. The closest I came was when I didn't acknowledge it and came close to tricking people into it. Except I can't really do that, as it makes me feel creepy.

Lately, its gotten worse. I'm downtown working in the bar scene again, and when hot girls in heels (especially red) walk by, my first thoughts aren't how hot she would be in the sac, but how hot she would look kicking me in the sac.

I posted an ad on Craigslist, thought I thought was rather non-creepy, but haven't gotten any responses yet. 

Part of the reason (only part) that I have avoided relationships the last few years is I fear that I wont be able to find the girl that I can tell about this that will be willing to be an active participant. I hate to say its a deal-breaker, but I think it is a deal-breaker. Unless I could find a girl that was understanding about me going somewhere else for my BB fix, (and that would be it).

More to come later...."

Scenario question:
If I were to do a midget ballbusting site, should it be :
1) midget guys getting kicked by regular women
2) midget girls kicking regular guys (on their knees)
3) midgets kicking midgets??

There may be a market there."

Then I found out tons of other people into this....(BB).

Like, Saturday Night Live writers. Yes faithful readers, I kid you not.

Of course, the groin injury is usually a point of comedy. But in SNL they have gone over a few times, and I know the alterior motive of one of the writers (although he may be undiscovered).

Katie Holmes plays a tough as nails cop, who is interrogating Will Ferrell, playing the bad guy. Upon refusal to give the information, Katie reaches down and grabs the hell out of his sac. Then the director yells ""cut"".
Will Ferrell tells the director he can only do this about 2 more times.
Then the camera shows Katie, with the cutest and fiercest look in her eyes, go through about six more takes of the same exact thing.
Will Ferrell is crying, saying he cant do anymore.
Katie turns around, and asks ""Well, how about I just kick him?""

I think my jaw, and the jaw of every BB enthusiast, just hit the ground.
Seriously. That skit played out like a bb-forum board fantasy. I'm calling shenanigans.

Then, Jennifer Garner gives the opening speech one episode. ""Wow, its great being off from Alias for the week. I didnt have to kick anybody in the groin this week. I did kick people in the groin, just not because I had to"".
Which is a lie anyways. I watch Alias, and she never kicks anyone in the nuts. 

And seriously, wrestling. It always used to be the scary looking female wrestlers that did the ballbusting moves. Now its the hottest wrestlers out there. It kind of invokes a ""dude, shes so hot, I'd let her kick me if she wanted"" response from the non enthusiasts.

I used to feel like a weirdo, but now I know there's tons of us out there. Spreading the word. Telling every girl that gets groped in the bar ""you shouldnt take that...go kick him""....and placing hypnotic suggestions everywhere.
Before long I'll be splicing scenes in movies with one frame shots....lol."

"event","""How can you take that?""

Think of it like this. If you're sparring, you dont throw knockout blows at your partner.
In consensual BB, you typically dont ask and hope not to receive, full force kicks.
Those are reserved (or should be) for guys that grope women inappopriately in bars
and when women are being attacked.

It doesnt take much to drop a guy. And being dropped is only a temporary pain, its not that bad.
However, if I get kicked full force with man killer shoes (you know, the kind the girls wear that have that really sharp, tapered toe)--there is nothing fun about that. Steel toes aren't cool either.

Its more like soft and teasing and building up, and that occasional, naughty, just a tad bit too much for you
to handle thrown in.

Thats why its not as bad as many of you guys imagine. What you think of is when a girl gets pissed, 
and hauls off and kicks you like a mule. I'm not operating on that wavelength."

I think I'm about to ""out myself"" and walk out of my ""freak closet"" on my regular journal. And make an open entry.
Why?
a) I have a fetish for telling people my fetishes?? or
b) I cant stand not feeling normal or accepted and that I have to hide certain things about myself. I'd like to know that if some people cant handle it, they wont stick around. I think its validation on a mass scale I'm seeking. 

I have found that the more I reveal to some people, that they have become comfortable in revealing freaky things about themselves that they've never told anyone.

And you know what?
Its fucking scary the first few times, yet its fucking liberating. I swear, its a rush. Not quite like jumping out of an airplane, but hell if your mouth doesnt get dry and your stomach twist a little and your heart beat a little faster.

Its not like people need to be afraid to be around me. Scary, lecherous, violent guys may be scary, there's nothing scary about a guy that'll fall down on the floor in the hopes you'll boot him a good one. Hell, I'm cooler than the stress relief dummies you used to have on your keychains.

Well, I dont ask my friends to participate anyways. I dont want to make anyone uncomfortable. Now, if they're reaaaally curious, I probably won't say no. 

Hell, I hope my openness can help some other people be open about their inner freakiness, and then make themselves feel a little better and self confident. We're not judgmental here.
Well, as long as it doesn't involve sheep or kids or dead people. If it does, you're on your own."

"event","For years, I struggled back and forth with the idea of making a website.

See, I think about this (too much) sometimes.
But here's the deal.
People who truly into their fetishes, want to see them represented. More in numbers means more acceptance.
And you want to have it represented in the best way possible. And of course being totally involved in such
an aspect would be totally cool too.

<lj-cut text=""I'm going to cut this..its a bit long"">

But I dont just think with my penis. I'm pretty business/entrepenuerial (sp?) minded.
I look at the dollar aspect of things. 

I wouldnt spend a large portion of cash, to make a website, just so I can get my rocks off.

Pantyhose fetish sites are quite common, and the better ones make a very decent amount of money.
(See <b><a href=""http://www.pantyhoseaddict.com"">Pantyhoseaddict.com,</a>, <a href=""http://www.lycrapavel.com"">Lycrapavel.com</a>,</b> and for listings of tons of others, <b><a href=""http://www.winnie-cooper.com"">winnie-cooper.com</a>).</b>

The good ones make in excess of several thousand a month. Here's the deal. Fetish isn't quite mainstream. Mainstream sites, because of the gross saturation, have had to dwindle their sites down to smaller membership fees, and use annoying gimmicks such as pop-ups, etc.
Fetish sites don't have to do these. They do some marketing, some advertising, some networking on message boards, but people will find them. And they can charge more per month, typically.

Ballbusting Sites : <b><a href=""http://www.velvetkick.net"">VelvetKick.net</a>, <a href=""http://www.femaledom.com"">Femaledom.com,</a>, <a href=""http://www.calimg.com"">CaliforniaMeanGirls</a>, <a href=""http://www.britishbitches.com"">britishbitches.com,</a>, <a href=""http://ballbustingbibabes.com"">Ballbustingbibabes.com,</a></b>, and many others. Not to mention all the Japanese sites, where <i> tamakeri</i> as its known, is becoming very popular.

These sites are made for partial gratification of the fetishes, no doubt. But some of these sights are also owned by women. 
They wouldn't be made, unless theres a profit to be made. For such a niche fetish, there's five or six heavy sites.
And the fans of the fetish don't usually sign up for just one, they get them all, or they cycle inbetween them.

So a website I was going to make. I talked to a bunch of girls, arranged for some modeling, had a guy at the strip club who was a pretty decent looking guy who had a huge trample fetish volunteer for those shoots, and decided I was going to do a multi-fetish compendium site.
However, quantity would not affect the quality. I looked at what I didnt like about each site, and said to myself, ""I know I can do better than that"".

I had the hardest time figuring out what I was going to pay the models. People who do this, don't really want to divulge much information, as they are aware you're going to become their competition. I started to think that many of the models may come from a stripper background, and since they make loads of money anyways, you need to start at a decent price. I was going to pay $75/hr, but I think I was shooting kind of high. (at the most it would have been topless, no full nudity).

So I had the models all lined up. Then I got my financial aid money in, to the tune of several thousand dollars (dont tell thats how I was going to finance this...)

And then, I had a morality attack. For some reason, it seemed wrong. I couldnt fight the feeling out of my head. It wasn't as if I was exploiting anyone or putting a gun to their heads, but I felt dirty. Then, to top things off, one of my models went and became a ""born-again"" Christian, so I received a whole earful of ""Im so glad I never went through with that"" from her.

Its funny, but it was probably because of a woman. Not a woman that I held a romantic desire for, because although I've been accused of, that not how it is/was. I just met a women who blew my mind, that I had the utmost respect and admiration for, and I focused too heavily on what would she think. I didnt want to be considered a creep or a sleaze by anyone, and especially her, and I think it fueled my morality attack.
I then came upon a restaurant idea later, that I thought would be a sure hit. As I bought books and researched into it, I realized that you cant be the entrepeneur of a fetish site and a successful restaurant in town, and canned the site aspirations.

HOWEVER, 
Two years later, I'm reconsidering it. Multi-fetish website. Hose/stockings/heels/feet (haha C!)/bondage/ballbusting/smoking, and other assorted fetishes. There would be two sites, one that would satisfy the paying fetish-members, and the more artistic, Lithium-Picnic-esque version. I want to get back into my photography, and I have aspirations of being a sought after pinup photographer.

But everything I want to do in life, requires money. And its something I have little of. What better way to get there, than by doing something that I would obviously enjoy, and does have a great earning potential?
Sex sells. Fetish sex really sells. There is a high amount of demand, and not that much supply. As I surround myself with more open minded people, its helping to push that damn white angel off my shoulder, because in all honesty, I don't have to answer to anyone other than myself. Those that know me know I'm not a sleazebag, or that I degrade women. I may be a hideous pervert inside, but many of you agree that you are too, and the majority of the rest are in denial!! ;-)

What is important is the style/brand of pantyhose worn. Wolford, the Mercedes of pantyhose, is so out of the ballpark when you consider $2 hanes or $3 L'eggs.
Sure, they're more expensive. But they make the girls look like a million bucks, and they feel just as awesome too.

Ive known several girls who were into the asphyxiation thing (the please choke me but dont go all the way fetish).
I've met a few into sensory deprivation, and a couple into knives and bloodplay.

The more and more I talk to people, the more some of the other freaky shit sounds hot. Only because I'm this much of a freak, I guess.

I found a picture one day, that struck me as odd. It was painful. It made me wince at first. It made me almost want to cry.
But the more I thought about it, the more morbidly aroused and curious I was. I love vampires. And I love women taking control.

Theres actually are, or were (they keep getting shut down) several communities/groups devoted to cock biting. Here you had two divisions of people. Those that fantasized about permanent damage, and those that just fancied the nibbles and the gentle biting.
I found this community to have more women though, and this one girl always told stories where she bit it off in the end. (she's from Austin too). Her major turn on was she would play the fantasy to be a ""you might lose it situation but it'll be the best head you ever head"", and the fear and uncertainty of the guy is what turns her on. I dont know how she got many willing participants, thats like totally playing Russian Roulette. But hey, I'm not one to judge. 

The images like that I find erotic, but I dont fancy more than a gentle scrape or nibble. Ive seen some crazy pictures though. I'm wondering if I should post them.

"event","I tried to read up on the psychology of fetishes, because I still didnt understand mine. There is no exact science to it, but what I understood was this. Fetishes aren't a disease, you can't be cured of them. 
Its kinda like homosexuality. You either accept it, or you make yourself miserable trying to deny it. I honestly have to say that I became very open minded (from not being previously) about gayness, because of the understandings of my own fetishes.

After awhile, I started getting daring. I would wind up confessing to a female friend in a deep conversation, one by one. It was intensity in itself, because my heart would be pounding, and I would be freaking out, and then, it usually was all for naught. I think I began to develop a fetish for telling other (select) people my fetish. 

As I grew more comfortable with some knowing, I guess I got sloppy too. I had a few male friends that found out, by virtue of using my computer (forgot to wipe histories or forgot to log out of Yahoo). I was quite embarassed, and one roommate didnt mention it much, but would subtly embarass me at work. Hed ask one of the waitresses ""Hey, have I ever told you that I would love for you just to stand on my nuts and kick me a few times?"" in a real joking manner, and then laugh to himself as I turned bright red and walked away. They always considered it a joke, because he always joked about using heroin right before he came too work too, or would go announce that he had just done the most awesome keybump. He never gave me up. The other friend, was into suffocation, bloodplay and knifeplay and really deep BDSM, so he told me that I wasnt near the freak he was...haha.

So as I told more and more people about it, I ordained myself a ""BB Missionary"", out to spread the word that we do exist, that it isnt as bad as men make it out to be (although someone will vehemently disagree), and that we weren't really that freaky).

For the most part, I never asked my female friends to participate (save an intimate occasion or two). I figured even if its harmless to them, to ask your friends to do something that is considered sexual by you may be crossing the comfortable boundaries of the friend line.
However, as time would go on, some of them would get really curious. And start telling me over the phone what they were going to do (so few delivered)
Then some would show up at the club. I would bend down and give the hug and kiss on the cheek, only to find a knee suddenly jammed up at me, and a cute devilish smile. One time (in front of people who didnt notice) a friend showed up, a little tipsy, and leaned forward and started kissing me, then racked me at the same time. That caused me to bite her lip a little, and that was pretty damn erotic. I pretty much never got caught by anyone else, save a bartender, who kept my secret pretty closely. 
Then came Samantha. This girl pushed me and pushed me one day to find out my fetish, because she said she had freak-radar and I set hers off. I wouldn't tell her, but finally after a few days of her being at the club and talking on the phone, I told her. She was bound and determined to make me cry everytime she came in therafter, always getting this really sexy look and biting her lip. I finally had to make her stop because she had no discretion and didnt care who saw, and she was always a drunken mess by the end of the night too. She actually wound up going to be one of the main models on a website I was going to do, but what happened to her is for another story. 

I still wasn't at the place where I could tell the girls I genuinely liked, the ones I was having sex with, about this. It was frustrating, but nobody wants to invest the time in getting a relationship going, only to freak the girl out afterwards. It could have been far worse, in my opinion. 

I still would visit the community and tell my stories. I feel sorry for half that community. Half of them are comfortable with their little freakiness, and they tell girls, and other people know, and they have as much fun out of it that they can. Then there's the other half, who are so convinced that their social lives and everything will fall to shit, if anyone ever knew. They live their lives in constant doubt and frustration, more so than the rest of us. Its scary as hell the first few times, but after that, its a big relief."

"event","It seemed many people discovered the ballbusting communities all at once. All of a sudden, all these guys who thought they were freaks their whole lives, had people, including women, to talk to.
It didnt last long. You know how stupid guys can be. Theres a difference between talking about your fetishes and cybering about them. Hordes upon hordes of men would endlessly mess with the women, or accuse them of being men, that most of the females left the communities.
I honestly feel alot of those people have taken some pretty good kicks in the skull also.

So now, my conundrum is this. 
I'm a little more comfortable with it, but how do I tell women about it? How do I tell other people?
There were a bunch of fears involved. I didnt want to get involved with a girl, only to break it down to her
later, to have her freak and walk out. Or to tell my friends, and face what I felt was certain humiliation.

I decided, there's 2 kinds of women. There are those that are pretty ""vanilla"", who would freak out if you told them something like that, and there's the kinky, sexually adventurous type. I failed to figure there was a 3rd category, the indifferent ones who may give it a try if they really like you, otherwise, you just get a ""hey, whatever floats your boat"" kinda response.

I grabbed a screenname on yahoo, <i> pleasekickmynutsladies</i> (not very discreet, I know), and I probably asked 200 different women the Million Dollar question: <i> ""If your boyfriend or a close friend confessed that he had a fetish for being kicked in the nuts, would you be freaked out? Amused? Curious?"" </i>
I got into some pretty deep conversations out of that one question. Some were freaked out, and I'd say it went 60/40 acceptance/freaked out. I actually wound up making friends with some (still friends to this day). After awhile, I started getting more comfortable.

They opened up a new place on base, that also had internet access. It was like $6 an hour, and you got your own cubicle. I got bored one day of talking in our old Telnet Chat room, and looking up people online, and I typed in ""groin kicking"" into web searches.

I couldn't believe what I found.

It all started in a groin kicking forum on some old ViewAskew page. I read and read for what seemed like hours.
There were lots of guys that also had this same fetish, and even a few women (and a few women that were accused of actually 
being guys). How to's, how to tell your girl about your fetish, people relating their experiences, etc.

Soon that morphed into what was known as ""Scotts Videos"".
Scott was (and still is) the pioneer of the ballbusting movement online.
Pretty soon there were pictures every week of women busting men in seductive poses, and movie clips.
It still exists under what is now known as <a href=""http://www.velvetkick.net"">Velvet Kick</a>, for any of you that are really curious.

I had jumped into a whole new world. I wasn't the only one. All this time I had been deeply ashamed, and thought I needed my head fixed, and now, I wasnt alone. As a matter of fact, there were so many of us, that some people were making money off of it."

"event","What exactly is ballbusting?

Ballbusting is a fetish, where someone derives pleasure from, the nuts being kicked, punched, kneed, squeezed, stomped, or tramped on. Its similar to CBT (cock & ball torture), except in ballbusting its usually a direct extension of the female, as opposed to clothespins, electrodes, etc. While the majority of people that have a ballbusting fetish are male, there are some females I have encountered also, who proclaim to get very turned on every time they hurt a guy.

Within the realm of ballbusting, there's 100 different variations in itself. I'll explain more.

For those that are confused, yes it does hurt. As do nipple clamps/nails raked across your back, etc. For the people with the fetish though, theres an erotic attachment to the pain. In addition, consensual ballbusting is typically not done with the same intensity/ferociousness that a woman who is a) really pissed or b) fending off an attacker will do. Save for a few guys I have seen, men, whether they have this fetish or not, can not withstand a full force kick square to the jewels. It will bring us down to our knees (which is why it still remains one of the best self defense tactics for females to use...I'm willing to give free lessons if desired..heh) However, the nuts are pretty resilient too. I'll show a few pictures at the end of this that'll show you what I'm talking about.

There are different variations of willing ballbustees. There are those who prefer self-defense style. There are those who prefer girls barefoot, those who prefer girls in pantyhose/stockings, those that prefer women in the most evil looking boots or stilettos they possibly can, those that prefer knees, those that prefer grabs, and those that take it any way they can get it. There are even those that desire for a female to do permanent damage, however, that takes the fun out of the fetish if you've got nothing left to play with.

What is it that turns us on about it?
The answer is different for many men. For many, it involves a power exchange. Just like many powerful men like to be dominated in the sack, ballbusting involves a power exchange. Women are typically thought of as the weaker sex, yet men have been programmed with a weak spot that can be taken clear advantage of, in one fell swoop. There is something extremely sexy about a woman that confidently knows this, and will use it to her advantage. Theres the ""fear"" turn on factor that exists in consensual busting. The fact that she could do so much more damage when shes standing on top of you, yet doesn't...the fear factor makes for a bit of a tease. There's the closeness and ""intimacy"" of some of the moves. For an effective knee, a woman usually has to be pretty close. Many times she will use her shoulders to brace and you get to see her expression right before the drop, that sexy smirk of satisfaction she possesses in knowing that she is the one in control.

"event","Pantyhose it seems, have become less and less popular with time. I can remember a time when there was always ads on TV, in the magazines, etc. Now its more acceptable for women to not wear them. 

Womens legs are an object of beauty to me. They dont have to depend on natural genetics like tits, a good pair of legs can be built. Breasts only held minor attraction for me, as they were something that was totally beyond the womans control. 

I lived in Japan for a few years, and that is a pantyhose/stocking country there. Everywhere you go!! I have a major attraction for Asian women, and I may just return to that country someday.

When I was 11-12, I started taking a fancy to girls when they wore them. I was curious one day, so I went home and grabbed a pair of my moms and put it on. They felt so soft and silky going on. I buttoned up my pants and went to walk around a bit, and about 30 seconds later, I had the strangest feeling in the world. It made me dizzy, and euphoric. When I went to the bathroom I was so ashamed. I had just come, for one of my first times ever, in them. I was so amazed that just wearing something could do that to me, and I hijacked that pair and used them for my future learning of self-love. I tried wearing hose for a few months that year, but I grew out of that phase. I love them on women, seeing them on a mans leg (especially as I was starting to grow hair) was not appealing.

Some of my favorite pantyhose pictures beneath the cut. There will be tons more to come, but I picked a few out last night.

"event","Wow. I just had a scary moment. I typed this up, and posted it. 
Three minutes later, I get an AIM from Jeff...
""Uh...Carl, did you mean to post that in your main journal?""

OMFG.

So anyways, I continue.

About the time this ballbusting fetish was starting to materialize, I was also developing a serious pantyhose fetish.
I loved the way they made girls legs look, and the way they made them feel. All the colors were pretty (except those pasty white ones) but I especially loved the tan ones.

So, back when I was in school, the girls dressed up occasionally. Dressing up usually meant nice dresses or skirts, and really nice flats or high heels. And back in those days, girls didnt wear those kinds of shoes without hose--it just wasnt proper :P. (Why did things have to change??)
And I noticed something. NOt all of the girls, but some of the girls just knew they were tougher with these pointy toe contraptions on their feet, and they were more confident about it. They were fully aware of the damage they could do, and they liked to let people know.
Threats of ""being racked"" were somewhat common.

The best of both my worlds. Hose-clad hotties threatening to kick me.
Now, I was never enough of an asshole to piss them off enough to carry through with it (although secretly I wishes one or two of them had) but I did get my share of threats, which was enough to turn me on. Something about the way the word ""rack"" sounds, just sounds hot to me.

Finally, after awhile, the bb thing tapered. Girls grew out of their ""Im gonna kick you in da nuts"" phase, and with no one to talk to about it, (and no internet), it went to the back burner. My few moments were in movies such as Crocodile Dundee, where the hot chick nails the guy in the end of the movie. I already had enough time talking to girls, I didnt want to make it any more difficult by being a ""weirdo""."

"event","It started way back. I'll go further into the origins in another post, but this goes back as far as I can remember. 

For so long, I thought I was alone. I didnt think anyone else could be like me.

Eighth grade, and me and Lindi are wrestling around. Lindi is our cute friend next door in Marble Falls, with a decent body and a great pair of legs. By this time, I already knew I was a leg person, and Lindi had a great pair. And she was feisty.

One day, we were wrestling, and then, her foot shot out. Dead smack in the balls.
It kind of hurt, but as I looked up, she had this smug look of satisfaction.
I rolled around on the ground, playfully saying ""You bitch...that fucking hurt""
Yet somehow, during the discomfort, and the slow feeling of nausea trickling up to my stomach, 
something else felt different.

I was turned on.

This kick marked the entrance into Lindi's ""ball-kicking"" phase. Every excuse she would get, was a kick
aimed at our nuts. We would go swimming down by the lake. Everytime Lindi came up next to me on the dock, she 
would get that smug, sexy look of satisfaction, and ring out a kick (which was somewhat subdued by the water, but the turn on aspect of it was still full force)
Lindi's vocabulary became littered with threats afterwards. I then discovered that even threatening to kick me in the balls
turned me on.

Part of me felt really weird. There was no way this was an acceptable turn on. There was no way I could talk about this with anyone.
Guys were supposed to be turned on by titties and naked pussies, not a girl kicking them in the jewels.
But you know, once something turns you on, its almost like a drug. You've got to get your fix.

So I let Lindi indulge her ball kicking willingness, time after time. Her shots were actually not the greatest of accuracies, very few hit their mark where I went down to my knees. But they were still fun.
One time, after Lindi had kicked me in the water for about the tenth time, I was as turned on as could be. Lindi was making her approach by swimming across from the floaty thing I was hanging onto, and I knew what to expect next.
I pulled my shorts down, and her foot rang in full contact with my raging hard on. It didnt stop her from kicking, but she got that look in her face....that she knew.
At the end of the night, as we're walking up to our houses, she tells me ""Something tells me you actually like this"".

Summer ended shortly after that, and it was awhile before we could get back down there again. By the time we did, it was a few years later. Lindi had graduated from her ball-kicking phase and had a steady boyfriend, so all I had to go off of was memories."

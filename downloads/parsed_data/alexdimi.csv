"event","""The only wisdom we can hope to acquire/Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless."" (Four Quartets, East Coker, II)

At first glance, the repeated philosophical statements about time and humanity in Eliot's Four Quartets seem a little confusing and complicated.  Lines like, ""There would be no dance, and there is only the dance./I can only say, there we have been: but i cannot say where./And i cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.""  Initially, my response was ""Huh?"", but a more careful reading, and the Prof's explanation in lecture, made me understand that all four parts of the poem are really articulating the same idea and it is structured in a very cohesive and comprehensible pattern.  Reading the poem is very enjoyable and the more Eliot's thoughts are elaborated and re-iterated in different ways, the easier it is to absorb the meanings.  Like all of Eliot's poems, there is a plethora of meanings and interesting aspects that can be extracted and analyzed.  What i found most profound is the assertion that i began my blog with regarding humility.  It's really quite simple.  We are living entities and are composed of a mind, body and spirit.  Eliot places us in time.  We co-exist with time.  Time is in a sense 'living' as we live.  As sure as we live and die, time will remain a constant, unchanged element.  Eliot also says that our living, growing older and experiencing life does not make us conscious of life itself.  We learn and believe that we have gained knowledge through our encounters.  Yet in actual fact, ""Time past and time future/Allow but a little consciousness.""  I mean, what do we really know?  i am sure that at the end of my life when i contemplate my time on earth, my realizations will be ones that millions of others have recognized as well.  The knowledge we learn, ""imposes a pattern, and falsifies,/For the pattern is new in every moment/And every moment is a new and shocking/ Valuation of all we have been.""  I think Eliot is trying to say that the reality we accept which incorporates our daily lives and patterns is a life of 'going through the motions'.  We can be shocked and amused in this reality but we are not truly enlightened.  Enlightenment and pure ecstasy is reached outside of time and outside of this constructed realm of historical repetition. Some people experience rare glimpses of the unexplainable that is free of time and a tangible existence.  This world does not have the words or explanations that are adequate in explaining the unknown or another dimension.  ""At the moment which is not action or inaction"" as Eliot puts it, is the moment of ecstasy.  Accepting this as truth corresponds to living life with humility.  We explore this world and yearn to discover.  Though all we will discover is what is already present.  True happiness exists beyond the life cycle of childhood to adulthood and cannot be found in the processes of trial and error.  However, it can be found when we are not looking. It can be felt when the mind, body and spirit usurp our existing notions of happiness that exist within the confines of historical pattern.  
These are just some vague thoughts that i'm trying to personally explain, understand, and which are hopefully relevant to Eliot's ideas.  I really believe that Eliot's revealations are valid and valuable.  Undoubtedly, we will all continue to live and grow somewhere in time.  But, some time or another, we will end where we began."

"event","It is undeniable that T.S. Eliot is a multi-talented and exceptional writer.  His intricately crafted poems and thought-provoking prose illuminate the grand effort, intellect and intensity that he applied to each of his works.  His dedication is admirable and evident.  It also seems to me that he demands a lot from his readers as well.  The intertextuality (ie. Prufrock) and the many references to pieces of literature, authors and critics that he incorporates in his writing are aimed at an educated audience.  Being acquainted with these primary sources undoubtedly assists the audience in appreciating and comprehending the content.  As i've commented on someones blog, the footnotes definitely help in understanding the deeper meaning but someone who already knows as to what Eliot is referencing may have a more well-rounded interpretation.  Nonetheless, i find reading and trying to truly comprehend Eliot's poetry and criticisms very exhausting.  I know that sounds completely negative but i mean 'exhausting' in a good way.  His works call upon the reader to be fully attentive, focused and willing to absorb the intense imagery and meanings that every literary piece contains.  I am aware that all poetry and literature should be read carefully and analytically to uncover it's dimensions.  However, Eliot demands more than the average scrutiny.  It entails letting oneself be open to absorb the pictures he paints with his words to articulate the essence of it's meanings.  In the poem ""Preludes"" for example, Eliot vividly describes a scenario that grasps at all five senses of the reader such as ""The morning comes to consciousness/Of faint stale smells of beer/From the sawdust-trampled street/With all its muddy feet that press/To early coffee-stands.""  Not only do i visualize myself there, ""sitting along the bed's edge"", but i AM there.  Eliot has a powerful talent and i can't help but surrender to his words.  
In the last stanza of ""Preludes"" he writes four great lines that i wish i wrote myself:
""I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.""

It is obvious- Eliot, i am a fan."

"event","During this chaotic month of what seems like endless essays, assignments and exams, i feel overwhelmed and consumed with what i have to do.  My calendar is marked with barely legible key words that serve to remind me of my responsibilities, commitments and obligations. I know what i'm supposed to do and what is planned.  Yet, as i stare at the tangible guide in front of me, i am struggling to resist the compulsive urge to simply rip it up.  Do i dare?

It is quite possible that T.S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" is the cause of my indecision.  Prufrock is uncertain, apprehensive and questions the purpose and meaning of his daily activities.  He is aware of the people, places and things around him and observant of the customary routines that he partakes in daily.  Yet he questions his conformity with the expectations of a modern society. Modernity has constructed a society that is full of superficiality, individualism and consumerism.  It is depicted as a vain civilization where people are concerned with clothing and physical appearance.  In the Fourth stanza he writes, ""To wonder, 'Do i dare?' and, 'Do i dare?'/Time to turn back and descend the stair,/With a bald spot in the middle of my hair-/(They will say: 'How his hair is growing thin!').  Prufrock is uncertain, insecure and is concerned with how others perceive him.  His thoughts are unveiled in a stream of consciousness that reveal his continuous questioning of what he should do.  His inadequacy of making firm decisions and his constant indecision displays a man without a strong sense of self.  He has retreated within himself and grapples to determine his true identity.  ""There will be time, there will be time/ To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;/"".  Thus, Prufrock, unclear of who he really his, confesses to putting up a front; a social facade.  

What i particularly love is the repeatition in the poem such as ""Do i dare/Disturb the universe?/In a minute there is time/For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse"".  Prufrock has the persistent urge to relinquish the facade that he feels compelled to uphold and to just be.  He secretly wants to forfeit conformity in the modern world that discourages difference.  But straying means being susceptible to scrutiny and alienation.  Thus, Prufrock is weak and never acts upon his inner desires.  ""I grow old...i grow old.../I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled."" It's quite sad that modernity has produced values such as vanity, material goods and is obsessed with categorizing people based on how they look and what they have.  Prufrock is not alone.  I think the majority of people frequently feel torn between societal expectations and their inner passions.  It can be a very perplexing and confusing problem that causes individuals to be uncertain of who they are and what life they could and should lead.

So, i have calmed the destructive urge and my calendar is intact.  What this poem helps me to remember is that i must balance who i am, what i want and what i am obligated to do all at once.  Sometimes, it is difficult to sort out.  However, i believe living a life behind a screen is no way to live at all."

"event","When i pondered the meaning of the word 'criticism', i immediately thought of analyzing, judging and dissecting a piece of literature.  However, after reading Matthew Arnold's ""The Function of Criticism at the Present Time (1865)"", my initial definition of 'criticism' has evolved and has been rather significantly enriched.  I now correlate the term criticism with analyzing society as a whole.  

Criticism mobilizes fresh ideas and new interpretations.  As Arnold describes, ""these new ideas reach society, the touch of truth is the touch of life, and there is a stir and growth everywhere; out of this stir and growth come the creative epochs of literature"".  Thus, the function of critcism is to produce thought and change.  Literature is the manifested tool that spreads the intention of criticism, which is positive social and personal transformations.  Right?  (Feel free to criticize my understanding)

Arnold defines criticism as ""a disinterested endeavour to learn and propagate
the best that is known and thought in the world"".  That is, society tends to make grand-scale proclamations that declare what we know as absolute truth and the way we do things as the right/best way.  Criticism is a way to diffuse these flawed notions and perpetuate a better or different way of looking at the world and all the spheres within it.  Arnold puts it nicely by stating that ""Our ideas will, in the end, shape the world all the better for maturing a little"". I hope to discover this when i read his poetry."

"event","Some people drift through life mechanically, never truly appreciating the journey.  Wordsworth was not one of those people. In ""Ode:Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood"", he captures the complexity of humanity and thoroughly explores the relationship between the human consciousness and the natural world. 
   Nature has the power to ignite pleasurable memories of the past.  The innocent, worry-free time of childhood, where the world was an endless realm of possibility, is precious but temporary.  The short, early years of life enable youth to derive exhilarating pleasure and happiness from seemingly insignificant objects or moments.  These simple experiences of purity and blissful joy are priceless. Unfortunately, with maturation comes the obstacles of life that produce pain, hardships, reponsibilities, knowledge and anguish. Entering adulthood means the loss of childhood.  It is also the loss of innocence and the gain of the burden of reality.  
   However, the human mind is fascinating and capable of achieving wondrous and mysterious things.  The aspect that Wordsworth explores is the power of imagination through the vessel of memory.  We are able to exist in the present and a tangible person, place or thing can export us back to a time in the past (in our minds).  To a time in our childhood.  Not only can we recall this time, but our senses react as if we are actually reliving that experience.  Momentarily, the limitless happiness is captured and absorbed.  The difference, however, is that we are consciously aware that these memories and feelings will be lost.  They can not sustain themselves in the present world of adulthood....we know too much!  Consequently, the memory fades and in comes the pain and sadness.  The depressing realization that life has changed and the purity of our early days are over.  The world our smaller selves flourished in, although physically the same, as transformed into something completely different.
   Ok so i've confused you all and rambled on rather vaguely. Lets see if i can redeem myself! Although what i have extracted may sound quite cynical, i actually find this poem very comforting.  It lets me know that i am human.  Wordsworth seems genuinely in touch with his senses and eloquently unveils how difficult it is to deal with change.... to be reminded of the pleasure of childhood and know that you can never get that back.  The speaker is sad, but he is not pessimistic in the least.  The part that gives me comfort and prevents me from dwelling too much on the past is :

""Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower,
We will grieve not, rather find
Strength in what remains behind, 
In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be,
In the soothing thoughts that spring
Out of human suffering,
In the faith that looks through death,
In the years that bring the philosophic mind""
(ll 180-189)

This is life.  Childhood passes and we carry the burden of making mistakes and learning from them.  We move forward, through the highs and lows, searching for new ways to experience the world and create happiness.  Granted, we can never again feel the wide-eyed enthusiasum and pure innocence of being a child, but we CAN remember what it was like.  And on our darkest days, when life seems too much to bear, we can delve into our subconcious and temporarily grasp the joy that a starry night or beautiful mountain can stimulate within our senses, consuming our hearts and minds."

"event","""All for Love"" is a fitting title for Dryden's rendition of the story of Antony and Cleopatra.  The theme of love is embedded throughout the play and all the characters' actions are motivated by the prevention or promotion of the fatal love between the two main characters.  The passion and chemistry between them is evident and is felt by all those involved. This love also creates unavoidable tension that heightens the suspense throughout the play.
    The love story is not original and is very predictable.  The plot is reflective of dramatic, modern-day soap operas as well as many Shakespearean tragedies.  Despite it's traditional storyline and customary characters, the play is enticing and emotionally stimulating.  It is hard not to feel sympathetic for Antony, the broken man who is easily influenced and perpetually destined to be unhappy.  Right from the beginning, we know he is a fallen leader whose lack of military success and unachievable love leaves him to be half the man he used to be.  Then there is Cleopatra, the mistress whose quite despised by Octavia and Ventidius.  Yet, although she is the loathed, other woman, we can't help but secretly root for her, since the love she feels for Antony is undoubtedly sincere.  The exaggerated emotions and feelings presented, is what makes this play entertaining and amusing.  
    The most exhilarating part, is the confrontation between Cleopatra and Octavia in Act three.  I feel the jealousy, hatred and extreme tension emanate of the pages as i visualize the two opposite-looking women, glaring into each other's fierce eyes.  They cut off eachother's sentences, take cheap shots and make snappy, jagged remarks back and forth, which creates such lively melodrama. The love triangle situation is very relatable and transcends generations.  For example, Cleopatra's comment to Octavia, ""...for had you known but half these charms, you had not lost his heart"" (Act 3, ll 438-439) 
doesn't even need translation into contemporary English vernacular. This clever comeback and many that follow keep me intrigued throughout the act.    
  I find it astounding that centuries after this play was written, audiences can discover a familiarity and truth about the human condition. It emphasizes the mind/heart dichotomy, or in other words, the logical/irrationally binary.  Basically, human nature is to follow our emotions and that is how conflict arises.  For example, Antony makes a logical decision to stay with his wife and cut off the relationship with Cleopatra.  But does that stick?  Of course not.  Love, passion, emotion always gets in the way of rationality.  It is humankind's burden to continually decipher which path to follow and what internal part to listen to.  That's not to imply that the heart and mind can't agree.  However when they don't, drama is born!"

"event","After staring at a blank screen for over fifteen minutes, torn as to what aspect of John Dryden's ""An Essay of Dramatic Poesy"" to address, i beleive i have decided. Rather than write a shabby summary or scribble a list of general comments, i want to focus on the thoughts of Neander because he makes some points that i conceed with.  Neander favours English drama, as well as the moderns over the ancients.  He beleives that French poesy is not sufficient in reflecting the authentic beauty of human nature, ""those beauties of the French poesy are such as will raise perfection higher where it is, but are not sufficient to give it where it is not: they are indeed the beauties of a statue, but not of a man"".  This point is reflected in his view of French drama as well.  He goes on to say that French plays contain ""dearth of plot, and narrowness of imagination"" which seem to limit the dimensions of drama.  English drama encompasses more complex storylines, characters and issues which create depth of meaning and richness.  
Shakespeare is also the favourite of Neander in comaprison to Ben Johnson. Although he respects both playwrights for their contributions to the theatre, Neander says that Shakespeare ""had the largest and most comprehensive soul"".  I find this descritption of Shakespeare to be quite accurate.  I have always truly enjoyed his plays because they are not merely a story with superficial charaters, involved in an enticing stream of events.  Rather, they are multi-layed manifestations of the human conditon, containing extreme examples of human emotion and capacity.  Thought-provoking issues, such as the meaning of love, morality and all that life entails, are also included in all of his works. Neander recognises the complicated approach that Shakespeare incorporates in his poesy and plays.
The persectives of Neander seem to shake up or destabalilize the value associated with the admired French/Clasical drama of the time.  I find the whole discourse in Dryden's ""An Essay of Dramatic Poesy"" very interesting and rich!"

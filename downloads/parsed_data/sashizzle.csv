"event","its been a long time, i figured have an update and let everyone know about the most terrifying experience of my life...

so the other night emily and i had to help out at project graduation which was fun, but getting there was the worst and most scary thing i have ever experienced in my whole life.

it was pouring rain
the first time i ever drove on the highway with out an adult
it was really dark and around 9:30
our headlights had blown out so we had to use our high beam as headlights
and we were lost for a solid hour in the ghetto part of new haven which i had never been to before.
we called the JCC 23492734 times for directions and finally they just stopped answering our calls.
there was a lot of screaming and yelling, and pulling over to check the directions, as we continued to get lost.
so thennnn, i went to pull over to the side of the road and a guy didnt see my blinker,
and we were hit. it was horrible. i was shaking and panicing and already really stressed from being lost and having no lights and it being dark and raining and in the middle of new haven, an so it was bad.
we were both fine and so was the other driver. it was really his fault, and the car wasnt too badly damaged, just a dent. he hit us like in the back passenger door and the tire. thank god everyone was fine though, it could have been a lot worse.

but with everything settled we made it to project graduation which was nice.
all the seniors looked like they had a blast. i made braceletes and wrote letters for the time capsule. i cant wait till my project graduation next year. holllerr
its so hard to believe im a senior now. i cant wait, i hope next year is a good one.


we are going to the program at tufts tomorrow, should be a good time. haha
alright its late, and after a stupid drama-filled night im going to bed.





P.S. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CLASS OF 2005!!!!!! 
i'll miss you guys



P.S.S. I love all my real friends, who im actually good enough for. and all my friends who care about me."

My brian works in over drive to process, and sometimes it just seems to hard to handle. But I guess its all apart of growing up.

I think that my insecurities, really make me a bad friend.
Sometimes I really need attention, and reassurance that I have friends, and that I'm loved, and that I'm a good person. It makes me selfish and annoying, and then I do things I'll regret, like fight with people whom i love.

because i am semi-addicted to myspace now.
butt i shall be loyal to this livejournal that i have had since last may.

anyway,hmm ok so over the past couple days i fell into my bi-polar slump. this has been an on going thing since um, 8th grade i think, maybe earlier. but i will feel really great, or fine, or like just happy for a while, a week or so, maybe 2 or 3. but then i will slide into this slump, where i just get depressed, and like for no reason. i get anti-social, and like reserved, and i dont know. but i can constantly feel myself transitioning from these opposite moods over periods of time. maybe is manic depression? i dont know...ughhghghghdfdilktudfngs,d

and it doesnt help that i havent really been talking to anyone in school. nad for like the first time i got really nervous talking infront of my class, and i have no idea why i was scared, because i usually never am. and it was weird, and uncomfortable.

"event","i think i realized something about love, and myself, and the people in my life, last night,i tryed to express this with someone, it came out like all wrong, but all right in a way, the thing that i was trying to say, i couldnt, because at the same time, i wanted someone to know, but i didnt. and you guys are probably wondering what im talking about, but first off i have to say, that im really bad at expressing myself in words, and i think its because i cheat on all vocab tests. anyways..

im almost 17. im a junior in high school. life is flying by. i feel so old, but at the same time i feel so young. to young to be having and going through these emotions, of like love, and saddness, and then i realize, im not to young.

I finally figured it out, im in love, or once was in love - with j (i dont feel like writing names even though its a private entry, just incase, i dont want to embaress myself even more.) so i think i know why im in love with him, and i remember once telling myself never to lose this feeling, and so i tried to hang on to it as long as i could, and its not that it went away, but its different now, our relationship is different now, as we grow older we're still best friends, but you know, its different, we have our own lives apart. its only been about a year or 2 that our friendship grew, and i know that whenever we talk, im reminded of why i think i love him, but im only 16, so how do i know what love is? or what it feels like? or if it even exsists. and everytime we talk, im brought back into that state of mind, that i love.  so maybe thats what love is?


i think love is, a feeling,its so undescribable, but there is one thing that should be said. a part of love is wanting to be wanted,(thats part of the fun with the chase, and then when u have it things are different, you know?) and when you find a person, who wants you, and you want back, theres chemistry. when you find a person, who you can truly truly be yourself around, regaurdless of the flaws, or how annoying you are, or whatever it is, a person who makes you feel so comfortable, who makes you feel like your worth something, that your trustyworthy, or pretty, and just everything great. a person who confides in you, and you confide in them... i dont even know how else to put it, cuz love is pretty undescribable. but there is a difference between love and lust. the reason i feel like im in love, is because its with my best friend. he may not be the hottest, or the nicest, but he is him and and i am me, and we click.

the thing is im scared that i dont love him anymore, i mean i know i will always love him, regaurdless if its romantic or not, just cuz of him and everything. but im a little scared that i have moved on, and its hard to let go. i dont want to let go. it feels like i would be letting go of everything, not just romantic feelings, and i cant do that, not yet. because i love the way i feel about him, and he makes me feel, even when he is being an asshole. its more like, im not ready to let go of the past yet, because our past has been great. and at the time time this seems so selfish, but its ok every now and again to be selfish. its not that i only love him for how he makes me feel, its so much more then thattt.

and then i thought.. is it possible to be in love with 2 people? and then i realized im not in love with two people (im probably not in love with one person) but i found myself wanting to be wanted by this other friend whom i love dearly and for as long as i have known him we have always been close with each other (5 years mann). and after i sat and talked with him, because we have nice conversations, i think i realized , as much as i want to be, im not the girl for him, and he will find that ""someone perfect"" and all i should be is a good friend, all the way through, no matter what. but during that process it was weird, i found myself compelled to like guide him, to be protective of him, i dont knowwwwww,its like i wanted him all to myself, but i then thought what am i thinking? it is very possible to be great friends with someone, with out having a romantic interest, and i know that he really isnt the guy for me, but i do know that we are good friends, and thats never going to change, regaurdless if we ever hook up, or if we ever have hooked up. i will always love him... as a friend.

its weird, cuz i've always kept this a secret to myself, and to like emily, so now im talking about it, and there is so much to say...

which leaves me in a mess, i dont know what i want, well i do, but it feels as if its unattainable, and im just sick of feeling profound and trying to figure all this out, when i know its not going to happen, and it almost seems like an act. i love someone, and i want them to realize it, but still we are so young, i dont want to ruin it, <b>so i can wait</b>. but i am tired of feeling lonely, and in the meantime, untill im like 28, i just want to have fun, and find someone i care about, and have a good time with. like tiff said, someone to hold lol, and someone to laugh with, and all that good stuff. but would it be fair, since i feel like ive already reserved my heart? yes. because high school is all about having good times, having fun, and i need to stop with all the profoudness, because this entry is really long, and i havent even covered everything that i intended on doing. but thats ok. and its ok even if no one reads this, because at least i got it off my chest.

so the grand finale...
i think im ready, for whatever, especially for a good time, lol. it doesnt have to be all serious, but it someone else wanted it to, it could be. i just want to meet new people, have fun, and in a way, stop dwelling on the past, and find someone here... and i think i may have ;-) lol. so ""whatever tomarrow brings i'll be there, with open arms and open eyes""

Thanks for listening
sorry if you dont understand my gibberish.
im going to read the dictionary now
so i can improve my vocab."

Yesterday was early dismissal.
Today was a snow day.
ammazzzinnggg
I watched two movies
Eternal Sunshine of a spotless mind
and Being John Malkovich.
Both good, both weird.
Im feeling kind of philosophical.
Im going to have to have a good talk with jake
again.
Well, so yea..
Im confused on certain things
like boys
what else is new.
Ah i need a new life
and a new layout, 
so if your good with layouts could u help me?



you know what I was just thinking?
its kind of funny that i write in this lj, and i post pictures online, because no one ever looks at them, or reads them. its seems kind of pointless now. so why do i keep doing it? i dont even have anything interesting to write about, except i really like this guy, and i cant tell how he feels about me because i get mixed signals, and i dont know what to do about it anymore, cuz im tired of always being the third wheel, and lonley, or more so in need of someone to just kiss. i think that after watching all this OC i like desperately need someone to kiss because thats all they do every other minute. but its still like hard for me, cuz im trying to gain back the confidence that i had lost, and its taking for ever, and its embarressing, and frustrating, cuz im sick of being that quiet and shy person, who i dont like. and even though im trying to change myself im so stuck in a way on what other people think, which is hard to get over. i just want to be with someone who i can be myself around, as stupid and crazy and annoying as i may be. and i want to be with someone who wants me back, i really do. i just would like it alot if every now and again i could feel some compassion from another person, and that people could show me that they really do care about me.

The thing is, and i was trying to explain it to artie, that like, i go through these mood swings, that last like weeks long. where like i will be fine, and honesetly happy, because i know there is nothing to be sad about, and i will just be relaxed and not very inquisitive towards all my problems, and then ill go to the complete extreme opposite where im all depressed, and unhappy, and it really shows, and it kind of scares me because its been going on for a long time and i just dont know what else to say. but im just like sick of playing these games, and im ready to just be a happy teenager, and stop making things seem so bad, when i have the power to change the way they are. im ready for a change, and to work on it, cuz im the only one who can change things, i just kind of wish that i wasnt in it alone you know? its not even that i want a boyfriend, which would be nice, but i just want someone there, who i could kiss whenever i want, and just hang out with, and laugh and have fun, and be myselfffffff
to that someone... WHERE ARE YOU?"

Blood drive tomarrow, and then its FINALLY over... at least for now. Powderpuff tonight and tomarrow then the game on Wed. and I wont have to worry about that anymore, and then I can just finish stupid driving school. And tomarrow we are launching our cannons, yea we are going to fail. And I cant handle it, because it was such crap. 


Im just soo exhausted, and I think its a combination between all this work and these freaking, really dramatic mood swings that I feel I have been experiences these past two weeks.

"event","tonight... we missed the team dinner cuz i neevverr get any service... so i went out to chilji's and i stuck to my diet (boneless buffalo chicken salad, muy bueno)... it was a verryyy random group of people, it was me, emily, paloma, christine, faye, alysha, steve, dan hines and duncan markovich...

then we went to out house where we played guesstures. it was the 'Cunning Linguists' versus the ""Master-debaters"" it was fun. i <3 guesstures. and then jeffery came over and it was nice cuz i havent seen him in a month and i missed him, and then my neibor jeff came over aka enrique, followed by dan rank, and kelsey niteau and ashley switzer... it was soo ranndom but still fun.

and here are the amazing quotes of the night:


""This <i>is</i> a random get together... like the breakfast club"" - Steve



""I saw that movie and there was no breakfast."" - Alysha



""Come on Rank, lets get it up"" - Ashley



""Yes you can do it, you have to"" - Steve



""I'll CROUCH!!"" - Steve



""I was surrounded by big black men when i got my license picture taken""- Steve (very randomly said)



""Guesstures, it is anything like 'Mouse-trap' - wait I don't know how to play 'Mouse-trap'""- Rank



""I'm not a big football player - I'm not immune to pain"" - Duncan



""Why do you have to feel me up though?"" - Dan Rank to Steve



""I'm talking her through them, OKAY?"" - Alysha



""But then I feel like I being to easy"" - Faye



""Me and Rank ran the mile together and talked about McDonalds the whole time"" - Paloma




""-What did you get the first time you took the SATS?
     -940...
 -Oh good that makes me feel better
     -I was tweleve""                      - Kelsy and Enrique




""MATAZAH! - no it was plate"" - Sasha and Paloma



""Immm aaa jeeeddiii kknniiighhhtt"" - Steve



""Steve is pretty quotey"" - Emily



""AHhh someone is calling me... for once in my life"" - Sasha




""You might get ambushed by some soccer players - or you might get hit by a volvo"" - Rank referring to Paloma's senior ex in the woods in Guilford




""He owns 2,000 acres, you can buy a lot of prostitutes for that, he doesnt need you"" Jeff to Paloma




and that pretty much sums it up...
FINALS GAME TOMARROW!!!!

"event","So on a happy note, i weighed myself today, to make sure i hadnt gone back up again, and instead i had loss a little more which i believe is 4 pounds since sunday... which makes me exxtrrrrreeemmmmeeelllyyyy happy. and the thing of it is, i have less of an appetite, and i dont just eat when im bored or upset, cuz if that was the case i would have deffinately gain 4 pounds as oppose to lose it. and like i had a bite of mashed potatoes and it didnt even taste good, so i am making a lot of progress... wHo0t wHo0t! and i didnt really think i could do it, and i have been and its been so little time already, and im just happy about that... but not in an obsessive way lol...



yea but on the other hand, my family is really really pissing me off... i dont even know where to begin with my mother, but i cant stand her,... she is a selfish, and mean, and rude, and inconsiderate, and just a real bitch, and she is soooo mean to us, and i cant stand to be around her. she couldnt give  2 shits about us and she has no idea about my life or anything. she had no idea about the blood drive, i doubt she came to one full field hockey game all season, she missed emilys parade the one thing emily asked her to go to, and she is allllwwwwaaayyys complaining about the activities we have to do, cuz god forbid she has to get her lazy ass up for a 5 minute ride to the high school. not to mention she will NEVER let us practice driving.. um well if u dont want to drive us to our activities, i have to be able to PASS the test in order to drive myself! ugr=dfhsjkdlrs i really cant even begin to describe how much she bothers me, and its because she only cares about her self, and its the truth, and i can not wait for college only 7 marking periods away.. and it wouldnt be so bad if we could just get along and not every word out of her mouth is nasty and rude and a complaint... and like it makes me feel really bad, cuz i want a family that can sit down for dinner every night and not argue, and a mom who wouldnt find it such a burden that her daughter has tried to get involved in the new community that she was thrown into...

like any time i would try to tell her how i was feeling, she would just be, at least ur not as bad off as ur brother, he wants to move back, hes depressed, he doesnt have many friends, blah blah blah, how the fuck would she know any of that about me.. its not like she ever asks.. and i would have to say that my brother has adjusted here way better than any of us, and he actually has a life.

ahjskdhalksh fuck whatever, no more venting about my mother because i dont care, i cant stand her and thats that. she wouldnt even take me to powderpuff practice tonight cuz she had to go meet my aunt at the eel pot (the local bar) for a third night in a row... ahhh fuck herr


so besides coming home and finding out that i lost some weight today was definately a down day, and right now i need something to cheer me up.. but not food"

"event","... so to laura and whoever that anonymous person was who commented in my journal, it was really sweet and thank you. it was a little reasuring i guess you could say, cuz yea i admitt i had been feeling down, idk its just something thats always like in the back of my head, and it was nice to see that someone actually took time out to read and then respond to my entry. by the way.. who was that anonymous person? lol, i think i may have an idea as to who.. but whatever... 


so im bored again, but this time im not eating when im bored, im actually very full write now, i had a nice salad for dinner that my mom got me... it was soo exciting today, i came home and decided to weigh myself and i lost three pounds, and it was just really nice, and i was like shocked... props to kath, lol

right now im listening to the Beach Song that miss samantha feigman who is the bestest ever and i love her for always sent me, because its so like rare to the world that i couldnt find it, and it really is one of the best songs everrrr.. i love it


so besides the fact that the day went by really slow, it was a good day, during spanish we had a sub, which is always nice, and me and dani sat there making bracelets and belts out of masking tape, which ghetto phrases like ""fo shizzle"" on them, it was fun. i finally made it out to driving school, set my test date and all that... and then i had to work on maselli's stupid canon, since my partners seem to be incapable of work, i took a break from that to update this and then i noticed those comments on the last entry, and i have to say it again, they really made me smile

i know that sometimes in my head i make things worse for myself, and i am hard on myself, but it just seems like its hard not to be, i may be worth it, but sometimes i really dont feel like it, i mean some things arent everything, but its dissapointing when for one example, you work really hard all season to become better at something and it seems like it really didnt make a difference... whateverr


ahhh states this weekend, im excited. but then when its over the seasons really over and thats sad, cuz it feels like it went by to fast, and this years is going by to fast and christmas is already only in 37 days, and molly turned 16 today (happy birthday mol, i love you!) haha. yeaa


i just want the weekend to get here, cuz i need sometime to just relax and take a breather, im like stressing myself out over everything.. especially this blood drive ahhh

well basically i dont have much venting about my feelings today, most likely tomarrow i will, this was just one of those im-going-to-update-you-on-whats-going-on-in-my-life type entries, where its kind of pointless.

so yea, im gonna go attempt some work considering its almost 11 and i havent gotten started, and ill probably be back with more shit to complain about later.. but if not..

very exciting, awesome job girls!!! i <3 you

today was nice, got out at 11:30 to go to the game at trinity, it was exciting but cold, we beat avon 3-1, and now we advance to the final round for the state tournament on Saturday... we are already won our division, so if we win states we really are the champions. Its been a fun season. i loveee those girlss. Kath has been helping me with my diet, shes like my trainer, and so far i think its been working cuz ive been sticking to it, but its only been a couple days. but ill let you know when i reached my goal, it may be sometime next year. lol, who knows

its gonna be soo weird next year when everyones gone.. im going to miss the seniors a lot, but only the ones i like.


i'm bored and i dont really have anything new to vent about except that in the begining of today, i was having a bad day, and was in a bad mood. and idk, i was like crying in english but it was random, and i dont really know why, i guess it was just i kept thinking about things that made me upset, and like it was weird i couldnt stop thinking about it. but whatever im fine.

things are a little weird, idk, i cant really explain it, i just havent been myself much. i feel like sheltered and closed off, and like i am preventing myself from having friends here, and its hard cuz i still feel like the new girl, and i might be, but we are juniors now and i have been there since half of freshman year. it just seems like the people in my grade who i try to be friends with dont really like me, and i really have no clue why, and its just hard, cuz i just want to have fun, and stop feeling like alone and like i have no more self-esteem or self confidence, you know?

pefect quote from tonights One Tree Hill to kind of describe it.
""its not the place you go, its being able to feel like yourself when you first get there"" hmmmm

yeaaaaa, i like keep swinging back and forth, like my moods, i will be perfectly happy and chill one day, and then the next i will be like sad and depressed. its weird, but i cant help it. blahhhhhh


and the more i write this entry, the more i think its gay, and other people are going to think that its stupid, or that i just want attention, or that im being ridiculous but thats the thing, i have to stop caring what people think... if you think this journal this is stupid, or that what im writing is stupid, then dont read it.

"event","""im looking through you, where did you go, I thought I knew you, what did i know, you dont look different, but you have changed, im looking through you, your not the same"" 

^ we will get to that in a minute

The ""I AM SAM"" soundtrack is amazing. Its like all Beatles songs made over by cool singers like The Wallflowers, Amiee Man, Rufus Wainwright (who I saw in concert this summer) and a bunch of others. Its very nice, and calming. I just keep playing it over and over. This one song, reminds me of all of my friends. Im looking through you. Because everyone just seems so different. Yea this is going to be one of those gay journal entries, where I talk about nothing, cuz I dont know how to express what I am feeling in words really.
I feel like that this summer was one of those milestone summers, where I had a lot of revelations. Now that I'm home and school is about to start. I have been thinking a lot about who I am, and the people around me. I cant believe that Im gonna be a junior. My brother a freshman, and some of my best friends seniors. Time is going by really to fast. 

At the moment I feel like Im in a weird place. I feel like I have kind of lost my best friends. for whatever reason. And its weird, because I know I havent.. completely. I dont talk to half the people in Glen Cove, and now out of the blue I am starting to re-establish some relationships, which is really nice, but I know that things will never be like they once were. And as far as friends in connecticut go, there are a few. I wish there were more though, especially cuz Steph, and Danny, and Christine are all going to be seniors, and they are like my only friends here. I talk to other people, but I dont think that my grade really likes me. Idk why.. ""I try to hard"" i guess. I try not to let things get to me but they do. I still have 2 more years here, and I want them to be good. And now here is the thing. My absolute best friends.. the ones from Eagle Hill, most of them I have known for 5 years, and we have all stayed in touch and so close..... Im trying not to let things get to me, but they are.

ahh and Im sure that no one really knowns what I am talking about, or whom I am referring too, except for maybe Emily. And I wish I could just say it, but I cant.

I think that maybe I am like making problems up in my head or something. It all feels different, but you tell me that it isnt.... IT ISSSSSSSS annd I dont want it to be, it cant be, it really cant.

9th grade, as I have said so many times before was the hardest year of my life, I was lost in my own world, and since I was so far away  from all my friends, they had no idea, and I was locked inside myself I didnt let people here get to know the real me, which is probably why they all hate me. I hate how I use to be so outgoing and crazy, and now I dont even have a personality anymore. It  all carried over into 10 grade. I was like by myself, and was all alone. And it was still hard, cuz I didnt really let people know.. instead I would suck it up, and be there for other people, because that was important to me. Ive locked it all up for so long, now its like lost inside of me, and I go through these phases where I will be truly happy and fine, and all is well and great, and I think I will be ok.. but then there are times when I just feel so blank, or unhappy, and I want to just die, cuz I dont see the point in living, and nothing will help, not drugs or stuff, its just like a black hole and I hate it. Right now I feel like I am transitioning between both phases. Before I was all excited to go back to school, and to start field hockey, but now I could care less about any of that. But I can see that Im like this, and I know I am fine... I just need a hug.. Ill be fine...

I just need this to vent to, i dont care who reads this, its not for attention, cuz I am sick of those assumptions, i just need to vent"

"event","Im at my dads right now, we are leaving for Port Jeff, in about an hour... yay more traveling! ha. This summer has been really nice. It has had its ups and downs, but idk. it was nice. I realized a lot of things. Something like ""life lessons"" idk. I am in a weird mood right now. thinking alot. You know when sometimes you just want to give up on something, cuz it takes so much time and energy, but yet you are completely devoted, and you are afraid that if you give up, it will really be the end? and you dont want it to be the end, and it sucks that, that is the way the situation is, because things change and people change, and you are never satisfied, and you try so hard, and its not enough? this is like the case senario for so many things, school, sports, even friends and relationships.. presssurree.. blaahh, idk if i am making any sense. Its just, i dont know what to do. And its driving me crazy. why cant things be the way they use to be? back when we were 13, or even back to january. School is about to start, new chances to be that new person right? I thought this was going to be a rejuvinating summer. Idk about that anymore...i wish... blah."

"event","We just got back from Montauk, and now Im at my dads in Glen Cove. I had a really good time, it was very relaxing. A couple nights we got stoned on the beach, and partied with Bianca and Missy. there was a lot of sibling bonding which was really cool. (I cant believe that my brother is going to be in the high school this year. I'm excited) So Montauk was chill and relaxing. We had a bon fire and my dad played music, it was fun. We went horse back riding on the beach which was amazing. It was a nice trip. And tomarrow i am going to my grandparents house, and then to Alisons <333

I feel like we got to know everyone, all the little kids, the teens and seniors and then the staff. It was jsut so amazing.. I cant even begin to describe. I really want to go back as a counselor next year.

Field Hockey camp was really good, it ended on sunday. Saturday night my dad had a party, it was cool. Alyssa and Alison and Sam came, which made me really happy cuz I missed them so much, and I was really glad that I could see them and spend time with them and talk and just catch up on everything. (Lyss, thanks for all your help, with you know what lol)It was just really nice, especially because of camp I wasnt able to really see anyone, and I was happy. Then that night we slept in a tent in the backyard. Don't ask me why. But it was fun. I woke up really early the next day though for our final tournament games, and that sucked, but I was able to play well which was a relief. 

Then on Monday Emily and I went to Christine's with Steph, Faye, and Alysha. We played guestures. For some reason they all like really weird games, but it was fun, I enjoyed it. Then we went to dinner at Chili's and Dani A came. That was cool. Except I think the Chili's food might have made me sick.

Yesterday, was sooo amazing! We woke up at 7:55 and went to the city with Margret and Steph. Emily and my alarm clock was an hour off, so we thought they came and left and went with out us, but then steph waked in the door, right as I was getting out of bed, so that was a relief, although I didnt have much time to get ready. But then we picked up Margret and took the train. Margret was so funny, she kept talking in a southern accent and it was so funny. It was good too, especially since she use to live in Georgia, and Florida. When we got to the city and all those smells, I threw up a couple of times, and I had no energy which reeeaaaallllyyyy sucked. But we tried to make the best of it. I couldnt keep any food down, and I had such a hard time walking. But we stopped at a drug store and bought some nausea meds, and within 15 minutes I was feeling much better. So we went to Time Square and played in the giant Toys R Us. We went to barbies house, and candy land, and just took a bunch of pictures and had a lot of fun. After we left we saw the naked cowboy, which was great, he serenaded us and took pictures. Then we did some other stuff, shopped a little, went to the empire state building, because Steph had never been to NYC before, and it just wouldnt be the same if she didnt see that building, although it was too cloudy to go up top. Around 3:30 we went meet up with my dad for dinner, and it was good. We went to Earl's grill, they were very friendly and had good food. After which we went to the Guster/Rufus Wainwright/Ben Folds concert at the central park summerstage. Guster was absolutely incredible. They sounded so awsome, and everyone was dancing and singing along. And their drummer, also refered to as 'bongo man' was insane. And who ever was playing the harmonica was wonderful. It was just so awsome. Everyone was so happy, it was just like a happy atmosphere, which was really refreshing, and something I really needed, especially cuz I was feeling so sickly earlier in the day.
As I listen to one of their cds right now, it kind of reminds me of the beatles. lol. Anyways, Rufus Wainwright was good. He was funny, cuz he is openly gay, and was making all these jokes, and he sang 'Somewhere over the rainbow' which was great. He has a good voice, although at times it was hard to understand what he was saying. Ben Folds is just so incredible on the piano, and he was really funnmy too, and it was just really fun. I had such a good time.

Which leaves me to now, I probably wont be writing after Saturday, cuz that is when I leave for Eagle Hill for 3 weeks. But I will try to update once in a while when I'm there. I havent yet begun to pack, so I guess I should go do that. I'm also about to load the pictures from yesterday onto the website, so everyone check that out in like 15 minutes or something.
The rest of this week is just going to be madness. But fun too."

Yeaaa


Yesterday was amazing <3 we hung out with Sam, Alison, and Bianca. First Emily and I washed my dads car for 14 dollars. Then we went out to lunch. After which we ventured to Sam's, bounced on the trampoline, did some interpretive dance, then wen to Bianca's to see the puppies. They are so cute. After which we were down to 3 because Bianca had a softball game. Then we went to Alisons for an hour and saw her bunny. Then we dropped Sam off for her concert, and we went back to my dads. We went for a walk and found a boat!! Which we plan to restore and name 'SEAweed' hahah. We are going to paint it navy blue, with yellow stars all over it. Its going to be the coolest boat ever!! Then we had a bbq and did some more interpretive dance outside in the backyard, (i was thinking of you steph, and our dream for the apollo, then bianca came over, we had some fun with a ""party-in-a-bag"" and then had more food. After which Emily and Alison and Bianca, had a sleepover with out me because I had Field Hockey camp today. After we dropped them off we found out we didnt have to be at camp untill 1:30 so I could have slept over, but instead my dad bribed me with icecream and a movie. It was nice. 

Today I had the first day of camp and it was soooo hot. And I am quite rusty, so I am glad I'm going cuz it is deffinately going to help a lot.  Tomarrow and Saturday the camp is for 12 hours, I am going to die of a heat stoke, and exhaustion. Especially cuz I still havent been able to sleep at all lately. Although I think tonight I will be able to, cuz I worked out all day. I met some cool kids, it was fun.

When I got home I called my mom and we had a talk. Sometimes it sucks communicating with parents. I feel like she doesnt get it, and its just tough, because we are all off in our own little worlds, and I wish things were just a lot better between all my family members, but I don't know what to say, because they are not, and everytime I try to suggest a way to change it, it doesnt matter, everyone gets defensive and it just really sucksss. aahhhas;h adu;hyeta blah, Im a little frustrated right now, and kinda scared that its too late, and our family has fallen apart."

"event","Last night Em and I took the train into the city where we met our dad. Have you ever been in a public place, and there are really really rude and disrespectful people? Well that was me and emily, we were so loud and obnoxious it was so much fun. lol, just kidding, but there were these 2 guys there talking really loudly, saying curses and being really rude. for example ""yea, id f*ck her brains out on a plane"" and talking about emily and I. We decided to get up and sit in another car. So anyways after we met up with my dad, we had dinner at the vegatarian cafe called 'Zen Pallet' it was really good. Then we went to a Dark Star Orchestra concert. They are a really well known, grateful dead cover band. It was cool. Everyone was danceing and stuff. WE had this vip or backstage pass, whatever it was, because my dad had gone on tour with them as a fill in for the ""Bob Weir"" charachter. It was cool. We got to meet the band and they were all really nice. And the music, was actually really good. I enjoyed it. After which we had bagels and came home. Today I think we are gettting together with Alison and Bianca, and I am really excited!!! Peacee ouuttt"

"event","i have one academic class on campus this year. so my day mostly consists of trying to sneak off campus or sitting in the quad. im starting to really enjoy photo, i can get away with anything, but trying to take beautiful pictures while at school is hard, elmo is so ugly and dull. art is way easy, just like last year. i still havent figured out how to sign in for my online english class, so now im thinking it might have been a bad idea to join. oh well. i barely have any homework this year, which is really nice. im just so bored. i cant wait for thanksgiving break so i can go somewhere and experience new things, atleast just for a week, and im thinking maybe solo?"

"event","why does my car suddenly break while im driving home on the 22 freeway
and of course im in garden grove alone and its 3 o'clock in the ####### morning and all i want to do is go home and sleep.
thank god for my brother being able to keep me calm enough to not break down and cry.
so i pull off the freeway and into some sketchy ass parking lot get out of my car with my BRAND NEW WHITE PANTS on and get on my knees and look under the car and then i realize theres part of my car dragging on the ground.
of course this doesnt happen to me earlier while im with all my friends, but im all alone.
i couldnt decide whether to rip it off, try and tape it back on or what.
after sitting in my car freaking out about the creepy men driving slowly staring at me sit in my car i get enough guts to get out again and kick under my car enough times until im finally satisfied.
i sped all the way home praying that i wouldnt get pulled over and practicing what i would say to the officer if i did.

i hate you mustache and 
i hate myself for ruining my only hours old white pants"

I know I have two full years left, but I'm ready to be finished now.

Swing me upon it's hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat

I am fine with staying home on Friday nights.
I like being home alone.
I'd like to think I understand why we all pretend everything is OK when in reality it's not, but I don't.
I don't understand why you lie to yourself and why you lie to everyone else, but mostly yourself. You dress yourself up as someone they expect you to be. You want to think that you live some hard life where you have to pretend. Everyone has secrets, but you hold the record for having the most.
I believe you let someone know the real you, and you didn't like that. You could not lie, but you would never take that back, because you loved them. You still do love them, but they don't love you. The more they learned the less they liked, they know the real you and thats why you love them and that's why they hate you more than they hate themselves."

Last night I was finishing up writing my page to him for his memory book, and I just started crying, I tried to go to sleep last night, but I just layed there thinking about him and all the wonderful times we spent together and I cried. I eventually cried myself to sleep around 4AM and then woke up around 5AM to go to his goodbye breakfast. As soon as I got in Jamie's car and watched Rian drive the other way I was completely saddened. 
I think this might be really hard for me. I've never lost someone close to me, not even a real pet. I've only had one friend move away, and she only lives 20 minutes away and I see her often and talk to her everyday.
Disneyland won't be the same, there won't be anymore cigarette breaks and I'll even miss that. Getting 4AM phone calls from you asking me why I'm asleep will be missed. I'll miss you picking me up and going to the most random places we can think of, but always having so much fun.
I love Rian and miss him already."

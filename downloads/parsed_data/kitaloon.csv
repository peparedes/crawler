&quot;Nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend, and dared to die, not only in his defense, but after he was dead... These are my reasons for affirming that Love is the eldest and noblest and mightiest of the gods, and the chiefest author and giver of virtue in life, and of happiness after death.&quot; 
- Plato

&quot;I pray that love may never come to me
with murderous intent,
in rhythms measureless and wild.&quot;
-Euripides

&quot;And the coolness of your smile is
stirringofbirds between my arms;but
i should rather than anything
have(almost when hugeness will shut
quietly)almost,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your kiss&quot;
-e.e. cummings

&quot;Agnosco veteris vestigia flamea.&quot;
-Virgil

&quot;Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it.&quot;
-Song of Solomon

&quot;I do not love you except because I love you;
I go from loving to not loving you,
From waiting to not waiting for you
My heart moves from cold to fire.
...
Maybe January light will consume
My heart with its cruel
Ray, stealing my key to true calm.&quot;
-Pablo Neruda

&quot; Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love.&quot;

"event","So what I've been up to for the past week or so, between marathon napping sessions and unpacking avoidance and scouring the internet for good Kirk/Spock, is working on the new podfic of <a href=""http://www.lomara.org/sbp/"">The Shoebox Project</a> that&nbsp;<lj user=""musicianatheart""/>&nbsp;  has been running over at<lj comm=""cult_sbp""/>&nbsp;and in chat. I&nbsp;had the honor and pleasure of reading Chapter Twelve, one of my absolute favorites, as well as all of James' notes and letters in chapters Five, Seventeen (pending), and Twenty-FIve A, and the narration for Twenty-Five B (also pending argh).<br /><br />If you've never read the Shoebox Project, then this probably holds little interest for you, but! If you have ever wondered what I sound like when attempting helplessly to do voices, or if you have any desire to hear me sing a line from &quot;I&nbsp;Touch Myself&quot; (the only time, I&nbsp;assure you, I&nbsp;shall *ever* sing on the internet), or if you simply want the convenience of what I&nbsp;personally consider to be the single best fanfiction I&nbsp;ever have and ever shall read right on your very own iPod, then I&nbsp;highly recommend you wander on over to the <a href=""http://sbp-aloud.dreamwidth.org/585.html"">master links list</a> on Dreamwidth, which will continue to be updated as I and my collaborators get off our asses and actually complete stuff, and start downloading! Alternately, you can&nbsp; follow the <a href=""http://sbp-aloud.dreamwidth.org/"">sbp_aloud comm</a> over on Dreamwidth if you have an account. All the parts with <a href=""http://thewingedword.dreamwidth.org/"">thewingedword</a> listed next to them were narrated, at least in part, by myself (and yes, that's my DW&nbsp;account, and I&nbsp;do plan on using it and it does have my whole journal imported into it and all that jazz).<br /><br />Alternately, if you're just interested in hearing me make a fool of myself, I'll be uploading all my completed bits as streaming files on my <a href=""http://thewingedword.posterous.com/"">posterous</a>; however, without the responding letters and notes and such, you'll be losing a lot of the experience, except for Chapter Twelve, which is more-or-less intact. Above all, seriously, <a href=""http://www.lomara.org/sbp/"">read the story</a>! It's good, it's bloody brilliant, and I&nbsp;swear you won't regret it. Besides, that way I won't have to feel guilty for spoiling the ending with my chapters, eh?<br /><br />"

This morning we woke up at 7:00 because our R.A. got some guy from the Rugby team to come make us breakfast! I had a pancake, and the most incredibly delicious frozen-blueberry-mango-and-raspberry-with-orange-juice smoothie. Took my Honors test, which was... not fun; we had to identify and explain the significance of six quotes and write an essay, in 50 minutes. But then I was done with that and it was the WEEKEND.

  We spent tonight decorating our dorm lounge! It is now THE MOST AWESOME, absolutely without a doubt. We have not one but TWO Epic Banners, little 3W's all over the wall (our wing is 3 West), pretty fabric and Christmas lights over the windows and the windows themselves covered in WINDOW MARKER DOODLES. I'm going to have to take pictures; I seeded the banner with Shakespeare quotes, and threw in a cute fish, and there's a sea monster named Nausicaa on the window for whom I take total responsibility.

Afterwards, there was delicious pizza from Giordanno's and now we're all chilling in the beauteous lounge watching the presidential debate. Tomorrow I'm going to have granola and yogurt for breakfast, then go on a photo walkabout around the neighborhood with Molly and Laura, and finally have a movie night with popcorn and Stardust and/or Chocolat. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

This, you guys. THIS&nbsp;is what I&nbsp;was hoping college would be like; not being depressed in my room, but fun things and friends and awesomeness. And markers, you cannot forget the markers. And glitter paint! I&nbsp;smeared glitter all over my cheeks and chased Molly around the room saying &quot;Do I ~*~dazzle~*~ you?&quot;&nbsp;in my best Seductive Vampire voice, it was good times.


P.S. I&nbsp;got an A on my first Honors paper. A paper that you pretty much weren't SUPPOSED to get an A on, and with a discussion leader who was quite possibly the hardest grader of all of them. He wrote &quot;a pleasure to read!&quot; on my paper. I&nbsp;AM&nbsp;IN&nbsp;HONORS&nbsp;STUDENT&nbsp;HEAVEN."

"event","Prompt [underlining mine to emphasize important parts]: Both Odysseus and the four patriarchs in Genesis all engage in deception and trickery. Choose one of the patriarchs and <u>compare him with Odysseus</u> on how they work their deceptions and trickery and <u>what the significance is</u> in each case.<br /><br /><br />Secondary Prompt [inspiration only, I'm not actually answering this one]: In the face of evil we see in our world, and of the human suffering which is more common than we might like it to be, how can we believe in divine justice? Compare and contrast the justice-if you think it is justice-of the Greek gods and goddesses with the justice of the Lord in Genesis.<br /><br /><br />My Thesis [the general idea, not the actual thesis sentence]: Odysseus and Jacob both use physical disguises for the ultimate purpose of fulfilling their god-assigned destinies. However, Odysseus is regaining his rightful birthright, while Jacob is stealing that of his elder brother. <br />This reflects the differing ideas behind justice in the two cultures. In Homeric Greece, &ldquo;justice&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;custom&rdquo;, and it is appropriate that Odysseus therefore be restored to his customary place. In the Bible, justice is entirely at the whim of the Lord, who is free to overturn the natural order of things, giving his favor to the secondborn instead of the firstborn, as the Greek gods are not.<br /><br /><br />DISCUSS. It's been kind of a long time since I&nbsp;wrote a paper; is this intelligent, relevant, does it answer the questions raised by the prompt, is it contestable? Am I&nbsp;overcommitting myself, addressing the second prompt too much and distracting myself and the reader from the essential prompt? Any kind of comment whatsoever appreciated."

The people in front were the REALLY dedicated ones, obviously, all black-bar makeup and shit written all over themselves (I saw a guy with CATHOLIC on his neck.

It's a <em>beautiful</em> old theater, all gilding and carving and statuary, and whenever I was bored between sets I could just stare at the detailing all around. Even on the ceiling; there are <em>chandeliers</em>, for fuck's sake.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/fillmoredetroit.jpg"" /><br /><br />Like I said, beautiful. And I had General Admission, which translated to the teeny tiny pit, smaller than&nbsp;some club shows I've been to, that the orchestra would set up in during that sort of show. Having only been in line an hour, we ended up maybe ten-twelve rows back; we would have been closer if we'd gone for house right, but I had a not-so-secret wish to be on the Frank and Mikey side of the stage (and it paid off, oh yes).&nbsp;I ended up just behind a guy with blue hair, a lip piercing, platform boots, and a Dark Knight t-shirt. Unsurprisingly, we struck it off pretty well, and he turned out to be a genuinely nice person who helped a complete stranger out of the pit when she looked close to fainting. Through the Brownian Motion theory of moshpits I ended up running into him (yes, sometimes literally) a few more times, which was rather nice.<br /><br /><br />Drive By! I probably wouldn't have really noticed them starting if two girls to my rear left hadn't made the werewolf-switch from fangirls to ravening beasts; one of them lunged at my back and, um, ground up against it repeatedly. It was kind of awkward, particularly since she wasn't hot <em>at all</em>, and appeared to be maybe fourteen. The rest of their set was alright, but nothing special; the music was neutral, the lead singer not particularly charismatic, and they namedropped My Chem for cheers enough times that it was a little pathetic. So it goes.<br /><br /><br />Billy Talent, however, was an entirely different animal. They reminded me a bit of a cross between early My Chem and Mindless Self Indulgence; a little metal, a little hardcore, and a lot of high-pitched vocals and moshing. I actually got battered a bit at first because the center of the pit was suddenly full of these huge, burly men eager to mosh and elbow my short friends in the neck. So we eeled our way off to the left, choosing a strategic location close to the Future Frank Microphone, and had a marginally better time; it was still distractingly rough, and I'm pretty sure that's where most of my bruises come from, but the music was good.&nbsp;<br /><br />I also ran into Blue-Haired Kid a.k.a. J again when I moved left. Was he also Frank-minded and sneaky like us? I have no idea! But I MAY YET FIND OUT. Details later in this post!<br /><br /></div><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""the main event, including the Maybe Tattoo and how Gerard's hips caused me pain""><br />My Cheeeeeeem. They took their sweet fucking time getting onstage, though. We ended up screaming for every lighting test, sound check, and rising/falling curtain just to release the adrenaline (and oh, there was adrenaline. As soon as the first song kicked in I was feeling NO pain). Their entrance reminded me quite a bit of what Linkin Park did for Projekt Rev; billowy curtain which turned transparent under the dramatic flashes of light. Part of me was like GERARD, YOU TEASE, but most of me thought it was pretty awesome.<br /><br />They kicked off with Sleep, which is just- it's a killer live song, guys, absolutely fantastic. You can feel all the emotion in the lyrics and in&nbsp;the music, it's like a wave of raw power. And even though I'd expected a horrible surge, the crowd was... not docile, but practically polite.

I can, however, give some rather priceless highlights.<br /><br />- The Ghost of You was introduced as ""A hand-wavy song! Or a lighter-lighting song, or cellphone-waving song, I don't know,"" at which everyone dutifully pulled out something light-up, and then as ""and we almost drowned during the music video,"" at which half of the crowd started screaming like banshees. Myself included, because seriously, The Ghost of You! Ugh, so amazing.<br /><br />- Cemetery Drive. My personal favorite song, and one that I had no expectation of hearing at this show, so when it started playing I honest-to-god swooned for a minute before going completely nuts. I have this thing for that song that would take an entire post to explain, so suffice to say that it meant the world to me, and I will never ever forget hearing it live like that, so very close.&nbsp;<br /><br />- Headfirst for Halos! I'm not going to lie, I would have loved to hear Honey (or, for that matter, Vampires), but hearing anything from Bullets was nothing short of an honor. Also, Frank rocked out and threw himself around like a crazy motherfucker, I think he was having a flashback to his old days of dreads and hardcore screaming.<br /><br />- Teenagers, and Gerard declared that they were bringing out ""some friends"" to play along. Another band? No, it was a tech guy with a harmonica, and a bandana wrapped around his head hippie-style. I have no clue, but he was pretty enthusiastic, and I would love to hear the story behind that one.<br /><br />- I'm Not Okay is the ultimate summer jam! Somehow, I feel like I've heard that line before. It has to be hard to think up ways to hype your best-known song, I imagine.<br /><br /><br />There were some non-music-related Good Times thrown in there, as well.

His hair was actually unbelievably fluffy and clean when he first got out, it was pretty shocking while it lasted (not long). For each of the band members, there was a moment when it clicked that I was looking at a <em>real person</em> twenty feet away and not, like, a singing dancing action figure or someone on a screen; for Gerard, it was the wedding ring and his belt buckle.

That's a Drive By hoodie he was wearing, it was available at the merch booth; when he took it off I could see an adorable Godzilla t-shirt, the two neck tattoos (the Moment of Realization), and <em>possibly</em>&nbsp;a finished sleeve on his right arm. It really looked like it, and I was pretty close, but no-one else can confirm or deny and I'm not 100% confident. There appeared to be a face near the outside of his elbow, and possibly some words. Or birds, even. What you can't see in this picture is that he was wearing cutoff jeans that were <em>too short for Frank</em> and exposed his ankles and tiny white socks. N'aww. *grins*<br /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/mcr17.jpg"" /><br />SO. During I'm Not Okay Gerard did this... shimmy wiggle belly-dancer sort of thing with his hips and I was momentarily distracted from everything else ON THE PLANET, including breathing. The man has better hips than any woman I've ever met, god. Unfortunately, in a pit, distraction equals taking an elbow hard to the ribs. I SUFFER FOR MY LOVE, etc.<br /><br /><br />And the bee hats! Okay, so there were these people- I saw them in line- wearing things like yellow felt helmets with black bee-stripes, eyes, and curly antennae, and they said ""You give us a great buzz!"" on the back in green marker. Basically they were adorable, and someone threw one up to Gerard, prompting him to go all flaily and admit that he'd <em>totally wanted one</em> when he saw them in line even though he never wanted anything people threw to him! Except for drawings (draaaawrings). ""It just gets too hot for boas nowadays, you know? You should totally wear it, though, it looks cute.""&nbsp;<br /><br />Frank leaned in to tell Gerard that he also wouldn't mind if anyone tossed up a MacBook Pro. Nice try, honey. Frank was also playing little solo interludes between each song that were pretty sweet, I think.<br /><br /><br />Oh! At one point Gerard and Mikey were backstage during an interlude, leaning in really close to each other and talking. And if that's not&nbsp;daring enough for you, during another song Gerard gave Mikey this sort of shoulder grab and neck caress combo while making his This Is Inappropriate, Pay Attention face. It doesn't compare to the chest-licking of days past, but it made me happy. Mmm.<br /><br /><br />So they finished up with a piano-and-Gerard version of Cancer, then came back for the encore with Desert Song (Ray acoustic, Frank on the floor, Mikey backstage guzzling orange Gatorade and chatting with a sound guy, which I had a perfect view of), followed by Give 'Em Hell, Kid, and ended for real with Helena; ""If you've heard one song of ours, it's probably this one,"" and Gerard sounded kind of proud when he said it.&nbsp;By that point I had worked my way from eighth-row in front of Frank to fourth row in front of Mikey; perfect view, insanely close. It was full-on, arms waving and fists pumping and the crowd living up every last second. Memorable, absolutely.<br /><br /></div><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""post-show shenanigans and merch; again, probably not of interest to you, although there was A Boy""><br />Ran into Blue-Haired Kid a.k.a. J again. Made further inept attempts at flirting, somewhat hindered by the fact that I KNEW I was sweaty and disgusting, although he was obviously in the same state. I couldn't have done too badly, though, because he did ask for my number (and those of my friends, to be fair). I didn't give it to him, but I did give him my AIM screenname, and if he messages me? I'll just give him the damned cell number. Life is too short. I also turned around, ran back, and gave him a hug, so, yeah. It was probably just a friendship thing, but go me! anyways.<br /><br />Bought the MIKEY FUCKIN WAY shirt. I didn't really have a choice, since I've developed a possibly unhealthy fixation on the thing after seeing it on its namesake. I can never wear it to school, but oh, it is love.<br /><br /></div><br /><br />In order of album, the complete setlist was&nbsp;Headfirst for Halos, Helena, Give 'Em Hell, Kid, You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison, I'm Not Okay (I Promise), The Ghost of You, [possibly Thank You For The Venom, although I don't remember it], Hang 'Em High, Cemetery Drive, Dead!, This Is How I Disappear, Welcome To The Black Parade, I Don't Love You, House Of Wolves, Cancer, Mama, Sleep, Teenagers, and Famous Last Words, as well as Heaven Help Us, My Way Home Is Through You, and Desert Song. Kick<em>ass</em>, seriously, I don't know how you could beat that.<br /><br />And thus concludes the Epic Recap of Doom. End time: 7:49 p.m. Thank god."

"event","Okay, this is kind of a random question, but if <strong>you or anyone you knew</strong> in college was in <strong>honors housing or some sort of living-learning community thing</strong>, did you/they enjoy it? By ""living-learning community"" I mean the sort of arrangement where people with similar majors, similar interests, or in some sort of program together live on the same floor/wing of a dorm. <br /><br />The college I'm going to (Loyola!!! \o/) has about 15,000 students, and I'm eligible for their honors housing; I like the idea of a more personal group where I can make friends, since I'll be in an out-of-state college without anyone I know, but I'm worried about closing myself in too much and not meeting different sorts of people. Particularly in an honors college, where the other people are likely to tend towards driven and mildly antisocial (like myself).

"event","So I may or may not have mentioned, but I spent last Friday through Monday in Toronto, staying in Red's godfather's tiny downtown apartment with her and some adults. There were fabulous times and gourmet food and the consumption of questionable beverages. More importantly, we didn't fight or argue or get bitchy or depressed or anything other than divinely happy the whole time, which is <em>amazing</em>. What with all the things that have been going on with me lately, it's rather reassuring to know that I can basically live with my best friend for three days straight and be perfectly comfortable and happy- or, indeed, that I am capable of such amiability with any person.<br /><br /><br />On not unrelated lines, I think I might be better? Romantically, I mean, or at least emotionally. I still don't have a boyfriend, a girlfriend, or any obvious chance of getting either, and I still feel the lack and the loss, but the immediate issues I was dealing with seem to be resolved. There may still be awkwardness and anger and frustration, and I might not shed the lingering effects of hormones for some time, but I honestly do feel better. It's hard to believe, since there were times when I was melodramatically willing to swear that I would feel that way <em>forever</em>, but who knew; forever is, after all, finite.<br /><br /><br />Yesterday I celebrated my return by going CD shopping and&nbsp;picked up&nbsp;<em>The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me</em> and <em>Like Vines</em>, both albums I've been searching for for some time. However, I'm randomly missing four songs from <em>Deja Entendu</em>, so if anyone could share <strong>""Tautou""</strong>, <strong>""Jaws Theme Swimming""</strong>, <strong>""Me Vs. Maradona Vs. Elvis""</strong>, and/or <strong>""Good To Know That If I Need Attention All I Have To Do Is Die""</strong>, I would be enormously appreciative.<br /><br /><br />Wish me luck getting My Chem presale tickets tomorrow, but in another random tangent, I am so over myself. Enough about me, I want to hear about <em>you</em>. Please, if you have even the vaguest desire, comment with something that's happened to you recently- good, bad, or simply interesting."

"event","&nbsp;So, all today I had to deal with the Valentines Day thing; couples being romantic in the halls, everyone bearing flowers and candy, friends' nauseatingly adorable boyfriends. Obviously, I haven't been in the best mood recently, so I was taking full advantage of my god-given right to be bitter and moody. But, BUT, exactly three things made today bearable and even kind of awesome.<br /><br /><br />1) My clothes- the outfit I always wear on days when I need an instant ego boost. Red shirt and black vest, denim miniskirt and black tights, black leather lace-up high-heeled boots. I look tall and thin and amazing, and people visibly stare at my legs all day long, which is always fun. I can at least reassure myself that <em>probably</em> it is not a lack of attractiveness which has lead to my perpetually single state.<br /><br />2) This kid in my art class whom I don't even talk to that much got everyone at the table little valentines and candy. It was random, completely unromantic, and somehow it totally made my day. It's pretty cool just to have someone think that you are worth making happy.<br /><br />3) What completely made my LIFE, however, is that SOMEONE GOT ME ROSES OMG. They are virtual, and there are a dozen of them, and they are the BEST THING EVER.&nbsp;Ugh, they are&nbsp;so pretty, I keep just going to my profile page and staring at them.&nbsp;I don't know who sent them, though, because they're anonymous, which is mysterious in a cool way. But also sad, because I really want to know who gave them to me so I can hug that person enthusiastically and then kiss them wherever they would prefer to be kissed. If you want to stay anonymous, that's okay; you have my forever-ever gratitude and love anyways.<br /><br /><br />I had a vaguely emo LJ post planned, but the flowers completely derailed it, as did a tiny box of incredibly delicious truffles and chocolate-covered cherries&nbsp;from my mother. Am now firmly and comfortably ensconced in a good mood. You know what? I love some people and some people love me. That's a pretty amazing thing to be able to say about my life"

The former is pathetic; the latter involves a lot of punk rock, dressing aggressively well, and generally Getting Over Myself.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I have a great deal to say about the Nine In the Afternoon vid, much of it involving Panic's absurd attractiveness. Brendon is acting like a hyper five-year-old, Ryan sleeps in his hat, Spencer has <em>that beard</em>, and the entire band is wearing clingy long johns and fake moustaches; despite that, I would totally hit 3/4ths of that (Jon is just not my type, sry).&nbsp;Spencer Smith's arms and back continue to be ridiculously hot; Ryan Ross somehow&nbsp;rocks the college girl sleepy-and-no-makeup look. Ugh, you guys, I don't even know.<br /><br />The rest of what I think is about how <em>happy</em> this vid is. All of Fever's music videos had this undertone of bitterness or mocking to them; the Pornomime one, in particular, was downright depressing. In this video, it feels like Panic is just being themselves and making a video that they love, not trying to make a point or have a moral. I know that a large part of being a good celebrity involves looking like you're ""being yourself"" all the time, but I'd like to think that there's honesty in this band and this video.<br /><br />Maybe the tradeoff of all this happiness is a video that verges on the ridiculous and parodic, but I think it's really worth it, for three things alone. One, the Scene of Happy Meadow Clapping at the end, particularly the smile that Spencer and Ryan shared (possibly due to a good editing job, but I DON'T CARE). Two, the Brendon and Ryan hug at the very end, which is making me want to hug my best friend right now. Three, RYAN CLIMBING A LADDER IN HIS LITTLE SOCK FEET AND HIS HAT. SRSLY, YOU GUYS! SRSLY.<br /><br />That is all."

"event","7&nbsp;THINGS ABOUT ME, YO 


1. I kind of obsess over my feet. They're size 11-ish and very narrow, so I always&nbsp;try to&nbsp;wear high heels or specific kinds of ballet flats to make them look smaller.&nbsp;When I sit, I either tuck my feet under me to hide them or point them straight to make my legs look longer. 

2. Relatedly, when I'm alone in a room, I pretend that someone is always watching me so that I remember to have good posture and hold myself well and look attractive at all times. 

3. Before high school, my best friends were all disposable; they lasted 10 months, the length of a school year, and then every single year I'd get a new one. I never thought I was lonely, but I was kind of an ornery independant little brat. 

4. I use an electric razor because I'm weirdly afraid of cutting myself with a normal one. They're really sharp; I have visions of slicing long strips of skin off my leg like someone carving a turkey. 

5. The&nbsp;first CD I ever owned was by Shania Twain. I'm pretty sure I bought it for the song ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman!"" I cannot believe that I am committing this fact to record. After that, I didn't buy another CD for maybe eight years, which is hardly surprising. 

6. I'm horrible at playing The Sims. I use cheat codes to turn off aging, free will, and all the physical requirements, and then spend all my time making my Sims fall in love. I'm pretty much a hopeless romantic. 

7. I've been in love, or felt like it, three times; once when I was 14, once when I was 16, and right now."

The tour's been pretty heavily reviewed, anyways, but picspams never get old.<br /><br />Gabe was pretty cool too.

"event","&nbsp;In order to obtain an ID from the state, I needed my original birth certificate, passport, social security card, school ID, and two <em>other</em> proofs of residence such as bills or pay stubs. The hell, seriously, there should not be that much paperwork nor that many trips involved.&nbsp;On the upside, I think I managed to take a moderately-attractive picture despite the blinding flash and stark backdrop; only time will tell. I also under-reported my weight (only by four pounds!), which may well be the sign that I am truly an adult.<br /><br />I also registered to vote, which was comparatively ridiculously easy. I felt like the act should have some weight to it, some sort of emotional impact, but I just felt numb and a little cold. Such is the grim influence of government buildings.<br /><br /><br />Life continues same. I pine, like a bad romance novel heroine, but keep my mouth shut like a good friend, because no-one but me needs to deal with the details of my tortured teenaged soul. It's enough to know that sometimes I am fine and sometimes I am not, and that this situation will likely remain the same for some time, since there is nothing to be done. I truly apologize for inflicting my angst on everyone, but there's honestly no alternative.<br /><br /><br />I really, really want to go see Cobra Starship tomorrow, and it's actually going to happen! Great music, teensy tiny bar venue, and I get to stare at Vicky T all I want. \o/<br /><br /><br />I'm alone in my house right now. It's making me a little paranoid and a lot lonely.

I scared the hell out of all my friends by giving them huge sparkling smiles, randomly remarking ""Isn't today <em>fantastic</em>?"", and humming Gwen Stefani's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tEROk-Y27Q"">The Sweet Escape</a> under my breath. (The song itself is a little inane, but it's the only thing that comes close to matching how intoxicatingly good I feel.)<br /><br />I really want to dance, actually.

I am, however, an atrocious dance partner because I <em>always</em> try to lead. <br /><br /><br />On a slightly related note, I absolutely <em>love</em> that when I'm bored I have vast quantities of mentally-stored high-quality porn of actual literary merit to think about. I don't know what other people without fandoms resort to, but I vaguely pity them.<br /><br /><br />Even less relatedly, I saw Juno.

Johnny Depp can sing well (confirming my belief that he is god), Helena Bonham Carter is a genius at Acting Crazy, Anthony has an exquisite high tenor and is pretty like a girl, and they made <em>By the Sea</em> into an&nbsp;absolute masterpiece of comedic contrast that you just couldn't acheive on the stage.&nbsp;<br /><br />I cannot think of a reason why ANYONE in the world shouldn't go see this movie, unless you're queasy around blood in which case DON'T. JUST DON'T. Other than that,&nbsp;the music is&nbsp;amazing, the acting is perfect, it's funny and terrifying and romantic and morbid and utterly,&nbsp;painfully touching.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/sweeney_trailer088.jpg"" /><br />Also, Sweeney wants you to. Would you say no to that face?<br /><br /><br />By the way, if any Sweeney Todd fans on my flist have shareable copies of the second Ballad of Sweeney Todd (the 46 second one) and/or Pretty Woman from the Revival album, I would deeply appreciate it if you would pass them along.</p>"

"event","CONCERT WOO! Short story: small venues are awesome, pits are awesome, my bruises are totally fascinating. I MET PEOPLE UP CLOSE HEY. Cobra Starship rocked, Sherwood was pretty good, The Rocket Summer was not my cup of tea, Armor For Sleep had a hot bassist, and The Academy Is was worth all of it. Even Bryce Avery's unattractive singing faces. <br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Cobra Starship""><br />Through mutual accord we squeezed our way up in front of VickyT's microphone, which was easily distinguishable by being about six inches shorter than the rest. She was wearing a short grey dress that seemed constantly about to slip off her shoulders but sadly never did, and a purple belt that I've seen her wear in pictures, which was a touch surreal. Ryland was wearing a velvet jacket and white pants, which will be important LATER. <br /><br />Cobra did a very short set, opening with ""The City Is At War"" and moving on to ""Hey Mister DJ,"" ""Guilty Pleasure,"" and ""Church of Hot Addiction"" in no particular order. We were maybe five rows from barrier at the start, three rows by the end, and the crowd was INSANE. So much jumping and lunging and smashing. Everyone knew how to throw up their fangs, everyone had heard the new CD, everyone was enthusiastic as hell, and Gabe thought that was the best thing ever. It was pretty cute. <br /><br />They closed with ""Snakes On A Plane,"" which is only to be expected. William Beckett came out in a fedora and jacket, looking very sharp, and Sisky came on to do the rap, which was amazing. Probably my favorite set of the night, since I was still fresh and energized and excited. </div><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Sherwood, The Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep""><br />After that set we ditched the pit and got shirts- the grey-and-neon ones that remind me of The Great Gatsby. Hung out on the balcony for Sherwood, whose main attraction was their manic keyboardist/tambourinist; he would play with one hand while doing mad improvised dances, or play with both hands and be absolutely brilliant. I kind of love him and his dorky glasses. <br /><br /><br />The Rocket Summer was a bit boring, and the aforementioned singing faces were something of a turn-off. However, it was during their set that I ran into three people from bands (whom I will mention later), so I owe them something for that. <br /><br /><br />Armor for Sleep- all of their songs sounded the same? Not bad, just the same. Their bassist, however, was so hot that I seriously fantasized about fucking him through the floor. I think I'm developing a bassist fetish, which probably isn't a bad thing.&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""The Academy Is...""><br />The Academy Is opened with ""Same Blood"", and did a killer job. The whole set was slightly marred by the drums being turned up WAY too high, so that I could barely make out vocals, but it was still amazing. Let's see if I can remember the rest of the set list... The Phrase That Pays, Black Mamba, Classifieds, Checkmarks, Down And Out, Almost Here, LAX to O'Hare, Big Mess, Sleeping With Giants, Everything We Had, Bulls In Brooklyn, Neighbors, Seed, and 40 Steps. In not at all that order, obviously. <br /><br />William Beckett, up close, is simply stunningly gorgeous. From any distance, his height and thinness make him capable of speaking body language in bold, which he takes absolute advantage of. Things that would be absurd or laughable if anyone else did them are oddly eloquent, coming from him. His smile basically lit the room, his eyes are almost painfully sincere; he is invariably graceful, whether tossing a mic stand into the air or tapping a tambourine on the curve of his hip. William belongs on the stage like a painting belongs in a frame, and it's nothing short of an honor to see him there. <br /><br />His fangirls, however, are bitches. Drunken pushy sharp-elbowed scantily-clad bitches, and I took great joy in retaliating against their attempts to take my place near the stage. No more need be said. <br /><br /><br />40 Steps was, audio-wise, the best song of the night, since it was only guitar and vocals and I could therefore hear everything clearly. It also gave me an insight into and fondness for that song which I hadn't possessed before, which is pretty cool. Also, quite a few people randomly left then, so I ended up only a few rows from Beckett's very heartfelt and attractive emoting. <br /><br /><br />There were a few guest appearances; Gabe showed up during ""Classifieds,"" looking very dapper in William's hat from earlier and a nice coat, and also gave William a rose. They played gay chicken with microphones, which amused me greatly. The lead singer for Armor For Sleep came on later wearing the same hat, which is nothing short of fanfic material. <br /><br />And, in a guest appearance of The Gay, Beckett spent large portions of the show hanging all over Michael Guy Chislett, who reciprocated by going down on his knees dramatically to Beckett during a guitar solo. I am not going to lie, it was hot like burning. <br /><br /></div><p><br />So TAI closed with Almost Here, which was unexpectedly touching. William Beckett quite suddenly went down into the crowd, and everyone <em>lunged all at once</em>. I somehow got swept up in the crowd, jostled and squeezed up to the front, and for a good five seconds I was maybe six inches from his beautiful face. He had his hands stretched out, trying to touch everyone within reach, and he was unspeakably sincere and ridiculously good-looking. <br /><br />Then some CRAZY BITCH clawed at my arms and dragged me away, but it was still awesome. <br /><br />Other people whom I met: The bassist and crazy keyboardist for Sherwood, when they came to get their instrument cases, which for some idiot reason were stacked against a wall hemmed in by the crowd. Had a nice casual chat with the bassist, since I completely failed to recognize him; if I had, I'd have been too shy to say a word. <br /><br />More excitingly: RYLAND. Not so much a meeting as he slipped past us in the crowd. His hand touched my shoulder and my hand brushed his jacket- velvet, remember?- and then I stared after him for a second until my brain matched up ""freakishly tall"" and ""velvet jacket"" and I said OH SHIT out loud. Ryland is hot. And really fucking tall. <br /><br />Guess who else is tall? GABE SAPORTA. He was hanging out in the merch room when we left; we didn't have time to stop and get anything signed, but we waved and he nodded back (arms being occupied with fangirls). For the record, I've always found Gabe pretty creepy in pictures, but he's very handsome and classy-looking in person and well-dressed. Not creepy at all, surprisingly.<br /><br /><br />Concerts are amazing. Pits are amazing. I finally understand why Gerard Way was trying to get people to jump and wave their arms at Projekt Rev, and why the venue we happened to be in meant that he was doomed to fail. WANT MOAR. That is all.</p>"

"event","Part of the stress I've been dealing with just went away, but there's still a large portion left. Relatedly, does anyone know anything about headaches that hit you like a bullet, blinding pain for maybe ten or fifteen seconds, and then fade to a mild dull ache? I've been having them all week and it's terrible.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Here, I'm sick of thinking about stressful things. Have three videos that made my day better by factors of infinity!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""51"" />Mindless Self Indulgence- Shut Me Up. Featuring ""Reefer Madness"" clips, Jimmy Urine's impressive falsetto, and a lovely backbend from LynZ around 2:40. When I saw it live, Jimmy referred to this as ""the song that will make so much money that all of us, all of you, can get married and never have to give blowjobs for money again!""&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""52"" />Cobra Starship- Smile For The Paparazzi (clip). My reaction to this wavers between ""Ooh, cool song,"" ""Ooh, Vicky T,"" and ""OH MY GOD, GABE, HANDS ON THE WHEEL AND EYES ON THE ROAD.""&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""53"" />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Cobra Starship- Guilty Pleasure. This video appears to have been made for $20, including the cost of snacks, and I love it more than the Thnks Fr Th Mmrs video with&nbsp;its enormous budget. Every single person in the band&nbsp;is having so much fun that they can barely keep a straight face; even Gabe is so close to laughing that his eyes aren't dead like usual. It makes me so fucking excited to be seeing them, and in less than a month! I plan to memorize that dance and do it during&nbsp;the chorus when they play that song, because my dorkdom knows no bounds. Directed by Vicky T, as if I didn't have enough of a crush on her.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I have lots more videos of MSI, and particularly LynZ, but I'm saving them for the LynZ Primer. Which will hopefully be AWESOME, or at least informative, since its main purpose is to get people to write some fic with LynZ as something other than ""Gerard's shotgun wife to be ignored or used for angst purposes."" I'm limited by the fact that there's practically zero information about her pre-MSI days&nbsp;available, but I'm trying to compile as much as I can. She is an amazing person and really ought to be written into fanfiction in ways that would make her blush and hide her face behind her pigtails. Which she does, it's <em>adorable</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Anyone who makes me a LynZ icon will get my deep thanks, undying gratitude, and a snippet of picture or video from my ""wtf i am making a primer"" folder e-mailed to them if they give me an address to send it to. I'm not looking for crazy photoshop skill; my favorite place is <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/minimal_icons/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""16"" alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/minimal_icons/""><b>minimal_icons</b></a></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;, I hate icons with a billion textures. I just need something- preferably, something hot.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />ETA: Now actually featuring three videos! God, I hate embedding."

Wingdings<br /><em><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/mignolagraphics-wrath.png"" /><br /></em>This is my newest icon. Sometimes you just need to express your wrath to the world, and you might as well do it in comic-book style. I've always wanted to be able to curse in symbols (which remind me of the wingdings font)&nbsp;and speech bubbles; it seems more fun, somehow.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""and the rest""><br />2. Defiant<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/city_wall-defiant.jpg"" /><br />I was going for a sort of warm-neutrals with bright accents color theme for this icon set, which this icon epitomizes. I also love the very stubborn-sexy chin angle, and the fact that he has ""SPAIN"" written on his neck for no known reason. Is LynZ Spanish? It's one of my favorite pictures of Gerard, because he's well-dressed and clean and sober and he looks so damn satisfied with his life.<br /><br /><br />3. Halloween<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/popehippo-halloween.png"" /><br />Enough said, really. My favorite holiday of my favorite season, I have to show my joy. I love this shade of orange, the bright-white contrast of the fangs and the pop-art feel of it. As you can tell, I tend to choose my icons for aesthetic reasons as much as personal meaning. I also use more care than is really warranted; my friends could tell you that I apply that same perfectionism and excessive care for detail to what I'm wearing, from clothing to jewelry.<br /><br /><br />4. White Stripes<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/super-kc-whitestripes.png"" /><br />This is an icon of the White Stripes, but it doesn't really look like it, which I enjoy. Slightly wistful, slightly cheerful, like a goodbye that's long but still temporary. Nothing deeply meaningful, just pretty and pleasing. Also the White Stripes are awesome.<br /><br /><br />5. Ghosts<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/popehippo-ghosts.png"" /><br />Another fall/halloween icon. I just fell in love with the art and the cropping on this one, and it falls in perfectly with my color scheme.&nbsp;Ghosts are my favorite thing I don't really believe in (no matter how much I jump at small noises after an episode of Supernatural), and these ones are so cute! Paper-bag ghosts.<br /><br /><br />6. Threadless<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/tardis80threadless-dipper-1.jpg"" /><br />This one came from a Threadless design, obviously. I think it's sweet and funny and artistically interesting. Starry skies are my favorite. If I'm commenting/posting and it's night in my time zone, I will probably use this icon, because no-one ever said I was too deep.<br /><br /><br />7. Death<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/Death-1.jpg"" /><br />If I had this chick's attitude towards life and its problems, I would be much better off. I love this scene in the comics, with the pigeons, it's adorable.</div><br /><br />So, feel free to comment and spread the fun. Also, searching through Buzznet has made me want to do a ""How LynZ Is Enough Like A Certain Rhythm Guitarist To Make Psychologists Sit Up And Take Notice"" picspam, because SERIOUSLY.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I want to make a ""Yay It's Fall!"" playlist. It would be a lot of acoustic-y ballads and some piano songs, because those do best with a background of crunching leaves and cold winds."

Post this along with your answers in your own journal so that others can play along.</em> <br /><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://seanarenay.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://seanarenay.livejournal.com/""><b>seanarenay</b></a></div>&nbsp;asked me about seven things: <br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""including celadon, foil wrappers, and physics is my girlfriend"">1. celadon <br /><br />Celadon is one of my favorite shades of green, which is my favorite color-wheel color. It takes its name from this exquisitely beautiful Chinese pottery that learned about when I was having my passionate love affair with Chinese culture. I love both the color and the art, and it represents a lot of what I love about ancient cultures. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y254/Kit_Archivist/lung-chuan-celadon-image.jpg"" /> <br /><br />2. foil wrappers <br /><br />My cat loves to play with tiny balled-up foil wrappers. It's gotten to the point where, if I so much as crinkle a wrapped piece of chocolate, he's immediately waiting at my feet for his toy. It's absolutely adorable and I love his kittenish ways. <br /><br />3. genetic engineering <br /><br />I've read books on this, and written multiple essays, and it's something fascinating that always stimulates my interest. How far could we go with this? Preventing congenital and hereditary diseases, strengthening resistance to common illnesses and injuries- or further. Enhancing intelligence, strength, health, and appearance. Lengthening lifespan. Further yet, adapting humans for the incredible lifespans, mental stability, fitness, and unique traits required to travel and live on other worlds. People who are capable of surviving in the dryest desert, the most ice-bound tundra, half-amphibious mermaid-people. <br /><br />I realize that we'll probably invest more effort into solutions rather than preventions, and eventually into terraforming rather than self-adaptation, but it almost seems more fair to do it the other way around. Haven't we caused enough trouble changing external things to fit our needs? <br /><br />4. paint under my nails <br /><br />Probably my favorite part of the painting class I took. A lot like having lead- or ink-smudged fingers, sore muscles from exercise, a hoarse throat from concert-screaming, or even guitar calluses. Something I can show off, and take perverse pride in, and something that makes me feel maybe a little like a legitimate artist even though I am one hundred percent not. <br /><br />5. physics is my girlfriend <br /><br />Physics is totally my girlfriend. Sometimes she's really easy, and easy to get along with, and I love her for it. Sometimes she's a complete bitch and shuts me out and I can't understand a thing she's saying, but no matter how frustrated I get, I love the challenge. And I say dweeby coupley things like ""Just knowing Physics gives me this warm glow of happiness and satisfaction."" <br /><br />6. sharing initials <br /><br />One of my random passtimes is trying to match the initials of people I know with quasi-famous people. I, for example, have the same initials as Edgar Allen Poe. It takes a brave and/or crazy person to be my friend, truefacts. <br /><br />7. stargate (I've never seen any Stargates! Um, I don't really know what it is.) <br /><br />Stargate is/was a TV show! Stargate: SG1, specifically, since they made a Stargate: Atlantis spinoff recently. Stargate was my very first fandom, back when I was all wee and cute, and I still know people from those ancient days. The show recently came to an end after something like ten seasons, which is just insane. I will always be fond of it. <br /><br /></div><br />Taken from <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://arsenicjade.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://arsenicjade.livejournal.com/""><b>arsenicjade</b></a></div>&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Reply to this post, and I will write one thing I love about you.

Do not tag the person who tagged you or say that you tag ""whoever wants to do it.""&nbsp;<br /><br /></em>AHAHA RULE C, PEOPLE.<br /><br />1. I walk balanced on the balls of my feet; my heels generally do not touch the ground, not even when I'm just standing. I've been told it makes me a) graceful, b) naturally good at dancing, and c) in possession of incredibly strong calf muscles, although all of those are pretty unverifiable.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's not even a conscious thing, it's just the way I walk, and walking heel-toe like normal people is ridiculously cumbersome and uncomfortable to me. I mainly mention it because it's often the first thing a person will say to me; ""Do you know you walk funny?""<br /><br />2. When I'm bored, I type on random flat surfaces. I particularly like to type the word ""question"" over and over, because it uses almost all of my fingers, and goes in a left-right-left-left-left-right-right-right pattern, which appeals to my mild OCD. Since I've picked up the guitar, I also practice chords using my&nbsp;right arm for a guitar.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;The first music I seriously listened to was musicals, and I still have a subdued passion for <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>, and particularly for <em>Sweeney Todd</em>. Because Sondheim is a genius, and musicals about cannibalism will never be less than amazing.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;I am the worst person in the world at accepting compliments about my appearance. If you've ever given me such a compliment and wondered about my weird, awkward, overly-modest reply, the truth is that I was pulling on my hair with one hand and saying ""NO NO SERIOUSLY NO."" It's just a... thing, I guess.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;Every single night I wash my face with soap, toner, and moisturizer. It's one of those three-step Clinique things, and I am completely obsessive about it, because it keeps my skin perfectly clear; it's rare that I even have a single blemish. It's also a weirdly soothing ritual that makes me feel all clean and zen when I go to bed.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;I have never in my life had a boyfriend. Or a girlfriend. Not even the kind of person you just hold hands with, or go on one date with, or to one dance. Or kiss, just once. I am relentlessly single and I have no idea why. Fate, perhaps.<br /><br />7.

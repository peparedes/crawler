"event","No work today, but work tomorrow.  I did homework for about five hours today. Just womens studies and literature, but it was quite a bit of reading and writing for both.  I got into another class.  The basic premis of this class is the socioeconomic and political climate for contemporary Africa.  I hope this class is as interesting as it could be.  I'm holding onto blind faith for that. 



Tonight I went out for coffee, which was nice.  I had a heart to heart with an old friend and realized that I am so grateful for everyone who has been my friend at some point, even if we're not friends now, in my life.  Every person has meant something unique to me.  

Anyways, we talked about where we wanted to be in ten years.  Then we talked about where we used to see ourselves being at when we were in high school, ten years from being 16,17,or 18.  It is so different for me, I could not believe the lofty expectations I once had.  

This gave me a new perspective though.  After discussing where we think we are going to be in ten years versus where we thought we were going to be, I started asking myself some questions.  Why did my dreams take such a dive?  I mean, I still have the same dreams, but not the same expectations.  Why can't I see myself acheiving something great anymore?  Have I lost faith in myself, or have I lost faith in the world around me?  Is it because I used to think I was capable of something, or is it because I think I still can be capable, it's just that there are way too many other obstacles in being successful?    

When I was younger, I never thought I'd be in the place I am now.  I am in debt, working a job I get paid an hourly wage for, working irregular hours(I used to be on salary when I was 18) nowhere near finishing college as I should be, and I also feel far less intelligent.  I used to have passion, I used to have motivation. Now, I feel like I pissed it all away for nothing.  I have lost my ability to write well, my ability to make lasting friendships and realationships, and most recently my ability to have a decent conversation.  I got caught up in a lifestyle that was self-destructive and pitiful.  I lost friends, boyfriends, brain cells, self-esteem and gained weight, bills, and an overwhelming sense of guilt. 

I have failed myself.

Now, a few years older, and just starting to wise up, I am trying to re-discover what exactly it is that makes me beautiful, capable and just short of amazing.  I still have a lot of self-examination to go, but I can honestly say this.  I finally have the stregth to admit that I have messed up, but that I am capable of re-building what was lost.  I finally don't need alcohol to make me or break me, I don't need friends who let drama run over their lives. (And consequently mine.) I can finally pick out those I can trust, and yes I'm begining to trust myself to be able to do at least some things, correctly. 

Hopefully I can be somewhere in the middle of the ""lofty expectation"" of a teenage mind and the depressing reality of true adulthood. Hopefully I can find the middle ground and be content with what happens. However, it is something I will have to work for no doubt.  I have to keep focused and motivated.  I have to mold the ashes of what was lost into something more beautiful and more resiliant than ever. 

I have to succeed. 

I finally feel like I can start to breathe again.  I feel like my nose has come above the surface and I can finally take that giant breath that saves your burning lungs.  However, I do know my head is still in the water.  It can still be pushed down at any moment.  For now, I am treading the water, staying afloat.  I'm working on the stregnth that will enable me to pull myself out of this mess.  


So where do you see yourself in ten years?  Is it any different than you planned while you were young?  Even though most of you haven't messed up your lives like I have, I still dare you to take a look.  If you have everything figured out and you're happy, than who cares whether it's still the same dream or not.  The fact that you have something to hold sets you apart from most."

"event","I'm done feeling hopeless now.  
I think it was just a bit of situational depression getting the best of me once again. 

The only thing I'm having trouble with is coming up with my reaction essay for my Women's Studies (ugh) class.  For those of you who know me well enough.. I hate feminism.. hate it, hate it, hate it.  This class, even though I expected a slight leap, is totally forcing me into diving into the theros (yeah yeah, sp.) of femi-nazi-ism, and it's only the first assignment.  

Yeah, I know, women were oppressed before WWI.  Women got some factory jobs out of the war, women lead peace protests, women won the right to distribute birth control information and yeah, of course, we still hated people of different nationalities, so therefore we hated those women 2 fold. 

So did I learn anything?  In short, just names and dates.  Not ideas.  Not impressed.  This class is going to drive me nuts; I'm sure of it. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I start work on Wednesday, so that's cool.  No more boredom in that regard, and of course, it will be nice to have some money to work with again.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's really it.  Just sewing, reading, learning (stuff that actually interests me), doing mindless homework, video games, corresponding, networking, setting up apprenticeship, financing, planning, excercizing, brushing up, choosing, making, doing. 

Finally."

3. 7 Seconds - Don't know what I want to call this one, as I made it myself.  I'm thinking ""7 Seconds until I break your face!"" Yeah, that has a nice ring to it. 

As of this moment, I still have homework to finish, (it's not due until Tuesday) but I'm really full and very sleepy. I think I might try to take a nap.  
Work is going really well, Spring Break got off to a bad start, but all in all, ended out just fine.  

This week, working until Thursday.  Wednesday night is The finale of Project Runway, and I'm so excited.  I hope Santino wins, as he's my favortie.  But it'd be cool if Daniel won as well, I suppose, I just don't like this collection that he made. 

Thursday I have plans with Judd, but we'll see if that ends up working out or not.  I hope so, as I'll be sitting here bored off my ass otherwise, watching movies that I've already seen.  

Friday:  Not sure what I want to be up to, and I actually have quite a few options, after I get my shit taken care of during the day.

Saturday: ? If you want to hang out, give me a call, because I don't have to work... Renee, that means you! Grab Jed and get your ass to Ypsi for some Tiffany hugs and good coffee, fuck, we can go shopping if you want!!!!!!

I have to combat with my father about loans, primarily which ones.  I also have to deal with the fact that if I don't have money by December 1st, goodbye Eastern until Spring, maybe even next fall if things keep looking the way that they are. 

I also have to cram in a bunch of makeup work, including writing a 10 page paper on an inventor to substitute for my final in Understanding Tech. because I have missed just a bit more of that class than I had wished.  I have to make up a paper, and possibly a quiz, unless the prof decides he'll wave it.  Hasn't decided yet. I also have to watch To Kill A Mockingbird because I missed it in film class.  I caught it on TV last night about one a.m., but I was writing a paper then too, and unable to provide my full attention.  In addition, when I tried to at least watch the last hour of it, I fell asleep... so yeah.  I have to rent this now. 

On top of that, I still have regular work to be doing. I have a final online that opens on the 12th until the 15th and then a regular test online from the 15th the 19th, both of which I have to read for, and take more detailed notes on.  I also have a paper due on the 15th, and a group project to present on the 12th.  That's ALL in just one class.  I have to complete extra credit for government, study for finals in 3 other classes and pray to the academic gods I not only do well, but don't die at the end of the semester. 

I also have to work. Every night at Old Navy pretty much.  I had monday off, and I get Friday off, and that's it.  However, Friday, I have to sit in the Financial Aid office for an estimated 3 hours in order to iron my situation enough, to potentially come back here next sememster.  After that, it's library time for the afore mentioned research paper and I'll round it off with some coffee from the basement cafe and a little bit of filling in the holes of my reading for my Latino studies class.  AND IT'S BRAD AND I'S THREE MONTH!!! You would think that that would be a happy day, but by the looks of it, I'll be lucky if I don't fall asleep and end up face planting in my dinner.  

So yeah, I just needed to vent, and to let you guys know, even though some of you are just as busy, but the others that aren't know why I'm not answering my phone. 

Oh yeah, and despite the fact that I have free incoming calls, I owe Nextel 80 dollars somehow, after paying off 65 dollars, and I don't know why.. so this means Friday I'll be going to downtown Ann Arbor to have my bill explained to me as well.  

And I thought Christmas was supposed to be the best time of the year......... 

P.S. That's another thing that I have to do, I forgot... I still have 4 members of my family to buy for, and Brad and some others...

"event","So I'm feeling kind of self-defeated today. 
I don't know, lately I've been in an extremely off mood, and It's not getting any better. 
I'm starting to doubt myself and the things that (I thought) made me as a person. 
I never feel like I'm doing well enough at anything in life. 
I have pretty good grades, better than the average college populus.
I feel useless. 
I've been studying for hours now, trying to make up for the useless feeling.. and the worthless one. 
And it's not because anyone told me I am these things... I just feel it. 

(To those of you who knew me all that time ago, the words of another are resurfacing in my mind)

I'm starting to doubt myself as a friend as well. 
I don't think I contribute very much, I just seem to take and take and take... (maybe you were right..)
I try to make up for things, but with limited finances... 
There I go again making excuses as to why I'm not a better person. 

Don't get me wrong.. I have things in my life to be thankful for, that's the point of this. I don't think that I should have them right now. I don't do enough, give enough, nor AM I enough. I've been sleepless the last few nights because I worry all the time away. Grades, money, parents, school, GRADES, friends, hmmmmmmm. 

So I'm kinda having one of those days where you just want to strangle stupid people. Just because lack of sleep makes you silly and mean, kind of like drinking Jack Daniels all night. Kind of like I wanted to strangle this girl who had said that ""Condoleeza Rice is sooo smart"". HA. Kind of like how Easter is going to suck without you. 

Making my book is theraputic, but it also reminds me of everything I could have and should have done; and failed to. 

I'm drowning now.... 
xo.

Sorry, I just had to write it out... I have to resolve this feeling somehow, and after much deliberation, I decided to use this medium.   Oh and sidenote: The ""you's"" in this aren't all directed at the same person. But I think a couple people besides myself could figure out who is who."

"event","Today is St. Patrick's day. 
Fun Fun, except for the cops everywhere.... hahah. 

So lately I've been rather amused by my religious studies class as we are currently learning about Christianity. For any of you who really know me, have probably heard me bitch a few times about this particular religion, but I really didn't mean any offense by it. People are gonna believe what they want to believe, I just want to understand why they put their beliefs in this particular area. 

This is what I mean when I say that Christianity is confusing. 

The stories of Matthew and Luke are the only two stories in the bible that address the birth of Jesus. That's fine, but the fact that these two stories are completely different just furthers my belief that this religion is the most confusing. These books are back to back in the bible.  Here are the stories:

Matthew:  Matthew says that Jesus was born in the days of Herod The Great, the king of Judea. Herod died in 4 BCE, Matthew maintains that Jesus was born in 6 BCE. He goes on to say that Mary and David's home was in Bethlehem, they didn't travel there, and that Maji came to visit. (Maji are wise men from the Zoroastrian faith, they typically were astrologers) These Maji brought Jesus, David and Mary the three gifts associated with the three wise men. The Maji had come because they had consulted the stars and found that a great king was to be born in the west.  Not knowing exactly where to find this great king, the Maji stopped and asked King Herod if he knew where to find him (for surely he kept tabs on his people) and King Herod consulted his wise men and through deliberation (brought on by a historical account) they decided that it must be in Bethlehem. Herod told the wise men to find this baby and come back and tell him where he was, so he could be part of the ""joyous occasion"". However, Herod wanted his sons to rule, and was planning on killing this baby. The wise men once again consulted the stars once they found baby Jesus and saw that King Herod meant no good, so they took a different route home. This provoked King Herod to go on an Infanticide, where he kills all of the babies in his kingdom aged 2 or younger, hoping to eradicate Jesus. However, David had decided to go to Egypt and thus the baby was safe.  An interesting side note is that Matthew is the ONLY book in the bible that talks about Infanticide, and no where in history does it talk of infanticide at this specific time. The Romans were particularly good at keeping tabs on the kingdom of Judea at that time, and while infanticides are recorded all throughout Roman history, there is no record of this one. 

Luke:  Luke says that Jesus was born in the days of Quirinius' reign as governer of Syria. His office began in 6 CE which is 10 years after King Herod's death. (It is presumed that Luke meant Jesus to be born the year Quirinius took office.) Luke states that David and Mary did NOT live in Bethlehem but instead traveled there when the Romans took a census and asked all men to return to their place of birth with their families. This is where we run into a problem historically. The Romans kept very neat records of cesus' all throughout their history, and never once do they mention asking men to return home. And the point of Roman census' was to determine where people were (so that they could control a possible uprising if they saw one coming)and not to mention, there was a lot of the Roman population that were originally born outside of their kingdom.  Anyhow, so Mary gives birth in Bethlehem (WHICH IS THE ONLY MATCHING POINT IN THESE TWO STORIES) and not Maji, but Shepards come to visit the baby. No gifts were mentioned. And that's where Luke ends. For if Jesus wasn't born in the reign of King Herod, there was no infanticide. 

The only thing other point that we can derive from these stories which is not only matching, (Bethlehem as the place of birth being the ONLY one) but also historically accurate is that Jesus was born during the reign of Augustus who ruled from 27 BCE to 14 CE. 

So where do we get our year one? How did we decide when Jesus was born? It took Augustus asking a religious monk when Jesus was born. Dionysius Exguus decided that he was going to take the difference and split it in half. Matthew said 6 BCE. Luke said 6 CE. So he cut it in half, but the Romans did not know of the number zero yet. So they deemed it year one. So Jesus, thanks to Dionysius, was born in 1 CE. under the rule of Augustus. Jesus was 2000 years old in 2001.

So to me, this is a pretty good example of why I don't get Christianity. And honestly, while I'm not belittling anyone who does have faith in it, and more than likely understands it more than I do, I do not understand how it has amassed 2 BILLION followers worldwide. It is the largest world religion. While Judaism runs parallel WITH CROSSOVER in the Christian faith, and only has 14 MILLION followers world wide. I just studied Judaism in depth before this religion. Granted 6 Million were eradicated during the holocaust, but I'm really suprised at this. 

Oh yeah, there's one more story about the birth of Jesus. It is contained in a book that is not in the bible, but rather a book that should have been, but lies in the Vatican Library.  It states that Jesus was born in the Jordanian Desert. But that's the book of James. 

So yeah, while I do not claim any religion, and I'm not religious, I think I drive people nuts with my severe interest in all religion. But I'm psychologically and historically interested in such. Why do people place faith in any religion, and what in it makes some people crazy.  On top of that, where and when did all of this happen????? 

Sorry guys... 
xo. 

Oh yeah, Happy Fucking St. Patrick's Day.  (A Catholic holiday, Americanized by green beer and green clothing.) Wear green clothing if your catholic, and orange if your protestant. I hope Jim and Meredith still want to hang out. And Veronica too!"

This week has been a tough one. Three midterms later, and I started and finished an entire novel in one short day.  I went to the library for the third time this whole year.  I'm terrified of it.  It is actually really strange, because I am seriously afraid of it.  It is an irrational fear, not founded in anything, but swarms of people and the fact that it is so big and I can never find anything serve to elevate my uncomfortable state. It was a terrifying three hours in which my head was buried in my book. 
Moving on... 
I miss you so much.  I'm so sorry, I fell asleep with the ""Talk"" button pushed on my phone, so that's why you probably couldn't get through again.  I woke up after I was sure that you'd passed out as well. But I left you a message.  I hope you are dreaming well, and I'm wishing you a wonderful day at work tomorrow. I can't wait until Saturday.  And yeah, I no longer care to visit my family, I told you it was a transiet feeling.  However, I have to suck it up and take it like a tough girl.  It won't be that bad........ 

I woke up with a sick feeling in my stomach and a sadness in my mind. 
So now it's the tears of both Thursday and those of Jeff Magnum. 
Hmmm.... this is hopeless.

Kalamazoo and four bands. 27 year old prick who thinks he's punk and his insane girlfriend who wanted to tie me up and take advantage of me in front of you. And with you. (I'm sorry too.) Matt and his clown mask getting into a fight and leaving, after 'fixing' my hair, and telling me that I looked like Jim. (I hope I don't look like a boy, no offense to you at all Jim, I just don't want to look like a 22 year old guy) Chicken didn't get to Jetta as far as I saw. I was too busy watching over Erin and Alkaline Trio later, it was all Tiger Army. ""meet my girlfriend"" (that was adorable by the way) outside for mountain dew and falling down the icy hill, yeah I have all the bruises. Amanda falls down the basement stairs and Erin wished for blood. Ha ha, Chicken kissed you and that long-haired boy was so upset. Cutting through a living room full of white zombie, your bandana traded for a button you never wanted, satanist accusations and pagan stars in pen smeared across my skin. You had the HIM tears, and it was all my fault. 2 girls in the bathroom only to come get me. You walked down those stairs like your ankles were broken and Derrick pulled me into the attic to confess as to being an asshole to some girl I doubt I met. Bathtubs and the darkness of the basement. I always found you somewhere. Your head hurt this morning in part to Dan, slamming it into the kitchen wall, right? You can guess as to what the latter of the reason was. I am suprised you were standing at 2 in the morning. Because after all, the punk asshole ""i just nailed a red car outside"" called both of us Anorexic. Even in the face of some various band memebers and those very pretty girls. Stepping over bodies this morning and empties. They made a lot of money in bottles and I made a lot of new friends. I can understand why you were sick this morning carried over through the night. 

Thank you so much. 
Come see me more this week, if you can, because I'll miss you if you don't.

Friday: Coffee, nap, food, HIM, coffee, Meredith and Jim's, Bar, Jim drives us home, sleep. 
Saturday: Sleeping.. sleeping...Owasso, Harpos, DANZIG!, stomach aches, I-94 West all the way home, They, sleeping, 
Sunday: Sleeping and then you left and I was sad. 

I loved having you here with me. I only hope you had a good time. I feel guilty for not feeling well some of the time, and the fact that this weekend was on your tab..... I owe you a lot. 

But I'm so happy that you came and once again... I'm counting down the days until Friday....

Here's the list so far:

1. The girl who used to live on the first floor in my building... (she was so nuts it was amusing to talk to her)

2. Anyone who rides the bus from Ann Arbor to Ypsi at night..... oh man... that's almost scary insane. 

3. My astronomy proffessor.  I say that very lovingly, because she's soooo nice. And I've learned a lot. 

4. Blonde girls with cell phones... (ok, not all of them, but a vast majority)

5. Cab drivers in Ypsi. 

6. Anyone in Best Hall. (no, I don't live there)

7. Any frat guy who hits on me.  That goes for very ghetto guys also.... ha. 

8. Everybody's favorite person at The Ugly Mug... kirk.

I love living in this city.  It reminds me of Flint in so many ways... just smaller.  And people are insane... and I love every second of this... it makes me feel like a much better person.. not to be too mean. 

Oh please leave me another person who you feel is the most insane that you know... this could be fun. 

Oh, and did you know that one of Jupiter's moons may have life on it?  It's supposed to resemble our deep-ocean creatures we know nothing of.  I hope I'm still alive when they find out... that would rock."

Thank you Jim for stealing me from the harsh reality of Ypsilanti... (rejection, boredom, drama, depression, etc... etc.)
I've never been out that way before and I had so much fun it was unbelievable. 

Until Jim left me there.  Ha Ha. Just kidding, I had even more fun when he left. Because if Jim hadn't left me, I never would not have had the night to thank. (for the person it brought me..)

Thank you once again for driving me all the way home today.  It is so unbelievably kind of you, I can't say thank you enough.  I'm just sorry that I got you slandered with off comments last night.. and the water balloons sucked. At least I never fell down the hill. (hmm, which would've been worse, falling down the hill or having to go downstairs?) But it was worth it. And I was afraid you wouldn't like me this morning... 

I hope you enjoyed the Ugly Mug and I'm looking forward to talking to you again tomorrow.

I look like mommy's little heroin addict. 

And the sad part is that all I could think about, while the needle was in my arm, involved dialated pupils and the spreading sickness of a pre-amputated arm. 

Thanks for the screening on wed. night.... (kids in 404 Hill)
You fucked me up for 20 minutes... 

However, it was worth it... I made my contribution to the tsunami relief effort. 
And I got massivly hit on by a frat guy when I had a needle in my arm. Ha Ha. 

He gave me his number (assumed I wanted it) on the back of a blood drive sticker.
And he drew me a picture... some people try to hard.

Frat kid: ""I drew you a picture in case you were nervous about giving blood...french is so hot... I got drunk after giving blood the other day, it's awesome.... you should call me later or sometime at least.""

Veronica:  ""I don't think there's anything wrong with you.""

Erin:  ""It's low self-esteem, if you were more confident...""

Jake: ""You don't respect yourself.  You need to release yourself, as well as others, from blame for situations that just happen in life.  You also need to treat yourself sometimes.  You don't ever do that.""

Zak:  ""Ditto, (to Jake) You say sorry too much, you're untrusting (only because I said Zak was too nice to tell me the truth) and you're evil... you're from Hartland.  Do you realize how morbid this is?""

Jarred:  ""The low self-esteem comments are astute; perhaps some work on confidence will increase appeal."" 

Jim:  ""You think everyone hates you, I'm not kidding.  Seriously, you need to trust people a little more.  I agree with the low self-esteem, and I say 'who cares' what people think of you.  Be you and don't change for anyone."" 

Brooke:  ""You think everyone is beautiful! That's beautiful! See it! See it! Buck up buckaroo."" 

Meredith:  ""You need some confidence love! NO ONE hates you at all so STOP asking, you should hang out more, maybe that would cheer you up!  You need to realize what an awesome friend you are and what an awesome person you are in general.  You're too kind, I mean you let me come at your hair with BLEACH! Smile, hun. You are great. 

Robin:  Merrydeath is right... so HAH!

I'm sorry I couldn't wait to address my feelings.  It's cool that you don't like me, and you like her instead, I was just asking if there is any particular reason why.  I just want to know if there is some awful part of myself I need to change for the sake of finding ""happiness"" in this world.  I'm not trying to change it for you, but for others.  I just wanted help. 

However, that didn't give me the right to punch you twice. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? 

I wasn't lying when you almost got me to tears last night.  And you almost did it again this morning.  I was sitting on the edge of the bed thinking about what I said to you last night.. and my failure to comprehend your words.  You've shown me nothing but absolute kindness.  You've shared your bed, your clothes, food, etc.  You never had too, you just did.  And I can't believe how I treated you last night.  I also realized that maybe you don't want to get involved because you have a habit of severing your ex's from your life altogether.  Maybe I just don't want to be severed.  Friendship can last so much longer.  

Please don't run away...

Why doesn't anyone love me?

My seven year old sister came to stay the weekend with me starting yesterday.  Being mom for a weekend isn't so bad.  Last night we ventured to The Ugly Mug, (thank god for Melissa) got Chinese food, (she wants lucky bamboo now) went to visit Dom, (who wasn't there) went up to Robin and Errl's and then Arnie's.  We went to the mini-mart, then off to my place to watch movies and play Game Cube for most of the night.  The last part was particularly fun because we had an eight year old and a four year old to play with as well.  She popped the balloon in hot potato and beat everyone in the room at Mario Kart.  We all fell asleep to Finding Nemo.  (Hahahaha Errl)

She likes Errl and Robin and Arnie the best so far.  Out of all of the people we ran into and even my roomate and her family, she likes those three the best.  She says Robin is SO nice and she's pretty.  She says Errl's nice too, and it's cool that he listens to her favorite song.  My sister doesn't do well with normal people, but if you throw in any kid from a subculture and she'll smile for a few minutes at least.  We walked into Arnie's room and she pulls on my hand and says ""He has a mohawk!!!""  She was so excited.  I think she talked to him the most but probably only cuz he kept playing with her.  

She's so awesome though.  Between her ""friend with the eye"" story, her stories about school and her awesome sense in music and people, I forgot how much I love my little sister.  I mean what other seven year old walks around singing ""Brain Eaters"" to make her feel more comfortable?  (Stomping her feet and fisting the air to the ""Oi, Oi, Oi!"") Or singing ""Walk"" Come on Pantera fans.  She wore my Boysetsfire shirt for pyjama's last night.  

""Why can't we have some guts? Oi! Oi! Oi! """

I love hanging out with the kids I have been recently, but on an emotional level.. I'm fucked.

Observations:

 1. Around five years, your best friends dissapear... it's ok I guess, it's not like our high school reunions would've  been the same year anyhow. 
 2. Every one starts to lose their sanity in Februrary. 
 3. The people in your life who beg for attention deserve none.
 4. Vacancy is a learned coping mechanism. 
 5. Detatchment is unhealthy when you strip down to the motives. 
 6. Being an asshole kid is just about the only way to survive college. 
 7. I AM THAT ASSHOLE/DETATCHED/VACANT/HOLLOW PERSON I NEVER WANTED TO BECOME.

It's so strange... I need to be around people otherwise I am bored, but I am suffering.... there's too much going on.  From elaborate schemes to clinically insane friends, to saving friends from the shadows of their minds, to making new friends, and old ones who all of a sudden hate you, to making plans with 5,000 different people for the same day, to not having any money, between studying and hanging out... tests and laundry, family, Alkaline Trio all the way to Avenged Sevenfold.... exhaustion and not having time to eat, (resulting in more exhaustion) shaking and starving for more than just the physical satisfaction.... unpaid bills, loans, dissapointment and nodding off wherever...... worrying incessently about some people all of the time... cleaning more than just house... 

I feel as if I am the living dead.... all I'm good for is helping friends, and lately, i've failed at that.  I miss Dominik, it's only been a day since we last hung out.  

The worst part about all of this... I haven't been alone in days and I'm not sure that's the answer right now.

My world has now shifted to compensate for your existence, and you no longer have a right to reside here, with me.  I am Medusa's hair, Persephone's gaze, devoid of any feeling other than detatchment.  My headaches winding itself around you.  A violence shudders through me when i remember your feeling.  I bite my lip and watch the blood flow when i have to mention you.  I'm suprised it has any warmth at all.  My veins have to turned to ice. 

My words like bullets, the memories like wounds... 

and now I must dress the situation, for it is proving to be terminal............."

 when she took her throne. 
Vacant and hollow.

"event","Frat kids........... it's their motto. (The title)  You know, if I were them, I wouldn't be so proud of that. 

(I read it on the side of their sign in their house... after I got suckered into going)

I need advice, so EVERYONE, please leave me some. 

Have you ever started to like a person that you have a feeling you shouldn't?
Not for ego or sterotype reasons, 
but because they are a lot nicer, and more fragile than you can ever remember being.
And because you were told not to. 
And you're scared because this is the first ""crush"" you've had in 2 years...
And you're  afraid because you have to give pieces of yourself......away.
And you don't think they like you.
Especially not anymore. 
But you hope that they do still. 

I feel like I'm in Middle School again.. scared and nervous, and unsure about the whole thing.
I feel like I'm in High School again... wanting to and able to hang out as much as he can.. able to go anywhere and do anything.
I feel like I'm myself in college again... ready to give this entire matter up... realizing that I hated being hurt.. realizing that this might not be the best idea...... but at least he isn't my best friend.  Lord knows I fucked with that awhile ago. 

I feel like a dumb girl.   And I hate it. 

  A scream to guide me through my life."

"event","hi everyone i have temporarily moved to a new place due to unforeseen circumstances that livejournal blocked my comp from accessing to livejournal and you know how idiot i am at com stuff so i may take long to figure out so i've moved for more rambling at another site and if u happen to read this den yar it's fine u may ask me for the new URL but don luff bcos u think it's punny bcos it's suppose to make u remember and remember me and haha yar it's pretty lame and now i'm posting this from my bro's comp since he left to school to do some funny check up with his darling fren adrian who got into the same school and course with him whom he had known for ages and i know him also and i think i did a pretty good job in irritating ppl with this absolutely like not gg to end sentence that i think i'm satisfied already so i will just stop in another few more words although i still wanna irritate ppl more but i think i will just do a good deed and... YES ALRIGHT i will stop here.

"event","Spent my whole weekend catching up with friends. Overnight stay in T13 @ VJC with Daniel and Jacob, Victorians' day, Paedophiling @ town, Pork's 21st birthday party.. 

I feel totally rejuvenated. 

Ready to start all over my boring mugging life again.&nbsp; 

Found a potential study kaki - Wenhui! He mugs in HSSML after his lessons. That's great!

Read between the lines: I haven't done any studying this weekend. haha. time to start the engine!"

"event","tis a tiring day today. 

wake up den fwah. it's Vday. arts ppl so funky. today the occassion calls for funkiest dressing lors. dowan to look too poks in arts so had a hard time in front of the mirror. but also had to run around looking for the props i did for presentation and threw everything into my bag and rushed to school. 

meeting for 3201 w kheng guan, yaodong and yijia at 10am.&nbsp;for once i'm earlier than all the guys man. kheng guan came first so i asked him how long it takes to reach KR fr central forum. and weirdness!! he asked if i'm meeting wj. and he told me wj and him were frens since VS and din know he moved into KR till recently. hmm. ok la he said ten mins.. so i tried to reach biz forum in 8 min. din see wj at the biz forum so went to the side gate. but we totally missed each other la!! what i meant was.. we took different ways and we din see each other.. gave him the present den i went off for proj meeting already. 

yijia and yaodong is so trying to matchmake kheng guan and i. doinks. o.O 

lunch w yijia. he really super nice guy to talk anything under the sun. he and his mac manager dream. its really cool to have simple dreams and fulfilling them mans. 

3216 tutorial proj meeting.. got everything sorted out.. and went for 3216 lecture. almost sleep mans. cos i was really super duper tired and i dunno why. prolly recovering fr the headache ytd. 

3216 tutorial was fun and interesting.. had a good time presenting our case plus the assessment and the intervention.. its interesting to see the other teams presenting their cases in their own ways too. rather the tutorials than the readings. think i benefitted more fr there. 

by the time school ended is already 6pm. tutorial was for the full 2 hours mans. shag si le. 

- 

hope to swim tmr morning, and after that go sch for presentation rehearsal, presentation, dinner with biscuit and meeting at VJ/VS.. den supper with the girls!!! (: (: (: my favourite girls. i miss u all so much. gg to give u all kisses and hugs so DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM ME!! 

- 

after walking to and fro my room last night.. thinking whether to give or not to give the gift. after contemplating for such a long time.. i decided to just drop u an msn msg to see how u will react. i was kinda taken aback by the receptivity and.. of course i was glad. jacob thought i went mad though. 

the message intended is as simple as the gift."

"event","woke up feeling my whole body sore from the swimming yesterday. free day mar. so go and swim with my bro. 30 times to and fro the swimming pool (refrained from the word ""lap"" which could mean 1 x to and fro. in case u all think i shen) in 1 hour. damn tired. some loser tan marks ): hope they will go away.<br /><br />3201 lecture today was kinda like.. last sem's 3101 lecture. topic is so dry that it can just put me to slp. 2003 tut aft tt. sia la. dunno how to use the excel. paiseh den cant do the questions ended up writing some crap answer which was suppose to be numerically and quantitatively answered.. i wrote on the transparency ""depends on the ethics and beliefs of the manager"". when is suppose to discuss things like shadow price and sensitivity analysis from the data.. -_-||| but.. i mean seriously! when&nbsp;i read the tutorial question den i was like wah lao so unethical. wanna cheat your customer with only 1 disk drive in the CPU and nvm.. still wanna use alternate board!! bu hui ba. ok this is from the unorthodox, unbiz point of view. cmon la. do biz also must have abit ethics. ok that isnt wat this whole mod is driving at. i must get the hang of MICROSOFT EXCEL SOLVER! grr. n pang qi say that melvyn will test us during mid term. ): finally made some sense out of the shadow price and the objective value. (: n i gathered: never to do tutorials on saturday night.&nbsp;<br /><br />u will&nbsp;do this&nbsp;<br /><strong>4(25) + 5(10) = 60!!!<br /></strong><br />to&nbsp;wj: wah lao tell u something!! that china female tutor&nbsp;who taught&nbsp;our tutorial class today. she nv shave armpit sia!! omg!&nbsp;haha!! i miss melvyn already ):<br /><br />every tuesday after 3201 lecture will be budding social workers lunch gathering. and we'll talk about social work related things. it sort of felt&nbsp;different inside&nbsp;me. i dunno why.&nbsp;anw, we were also talking about.. attachment. the thing that i've been asking&nbsp;all my seniors about. cham liao&nbsp;man. dunno if i can go for so many trips and even go OAC / RACE. they told me things like working on saturdays and sundays or work till late on weekdays. and late is like midnight..&nbsp;say it will end on 1st wk of july. they thought they felt burn out during that 3 mth stint. i'm worried about all my plans for the holidays. ): ): ):&nbsp;oh and not forgetting a report to write after the attachment.<br /><br />i thought i wanna go / do:<br />1) OAC trip<br />2) Angsi / Horseback<br />3) Ophir<br />4) Kayaking Exped<br />5)&nbsp;OAC<br />6) Diving (not sure if will be affected)<br />7) RACE (not sure if will be affected)<br />8) Stong (okay this won't be affected unless i gotta hand in my report then)<br /><br />i saw zhuzhu like 2 times today!! after knowing her i realise i bump into her very often in arts. okay la we are all under the social work department but.. seriously~ imagine if we weren't formally introduced to each other.<br /><br />4 - 6pm 3201 tutorial.. and guess who i saw walked into the class. the person whom i had ""hated"" to work with last sem. the forever MIA person. i don think i saw her at tutorial 2 weeks ago. hmm. anyway. we all carried on with the presentation of our vision, missions, values, goals and objectives (doesn't it all sound familiar) for the agency / programmes that we wanted to do this sem.&nbsp;<br /><br />we are intending to ""set up"" an agency that deals with drug offenders and their families. we are focused with the before care services that we think seem to be lacking in the current services provided by the various agencies. we aim to deal with families with arrested offenders (not yet incarcerated) through providing timely information, counselling services and referrals. it helps when 2 of your team mates actually&nbsp;were attached to the prisons and 1 person who's on the prisons scholarship (:<br /><br />i think our presentation awed the class. especially with kheng guan's super deep and powerful voice&nbsp;- i think that voice commands alot of attention and respect. having to work with him since yr 1 sem 2.. this will be the 3rd sem working with him on projects.. he's the right man for a presentation man. not forgetting yaodong's creative design of the&nbsp;logo. he has the creative juices to put things together. when he explained to the class re the logo, wah lao.&nbsp;NEARLY a standing ovation..&nbsp;seriously. compared to the other groups, i think my group has the most realistic, pragmatic approach. just thru our presentation i could feel the project coming alive already. n fanny's presentation is just so neat and nice. (:&nbsp;this is the first time i'm working with so many guys in a social work class. they prove to be very very ho chio and fun to work with. especially yijia. he super HO CHIO LA! he&nbsp;meng gong weh and i feel like chioing out lOud liaos. yijia is so doinks after all the groups presented. acting like he's so emotional and said (tapping on kheng guan's shoulder and hands on his heart) ""i'm so grateful that you all accepted me into your group.."" -_-|||<br /><br />and i was right. that MIA person went to join another group for their project. wish them all the best and best of luck working with her. kheng guan and i were so cant be bothered to say hi to her.<br /><br />ordinary odd week Tuesdays."

"event","wah lao.. toot tired today after work. ): it wasn't so bad when it was full house.. today not even near full house.. so.. what did i do today at work?

1) move the milk (full cream, skimmed) and coffee creamers from the fridge inside the kitchen to outside the back area fridge and fill it up with milk. that's tons of milk cos the fridge outside is big and EMPTY. and i had to squat down to shift the jugs of creamers that were already prepared...wah my poor thigh muscles (fats).. den still gotta arrange the glass jugs of juices..

2) i song song volunteered myself to go down to the store to pick up the carton of tealight candles. the box reads 10kg!! omg. shit man shld have said i dunno where is the storeroom den i won't have to go into the dungeon like place after walking thru a maze.. 10kg through a damn long corridor with alot of turns and i took the stairs up to the restaurant.. after that squat down again to put the candles into the last drawer of the cabinet..

3) on ""floor"". means to serve the guests. already dead tired from all the ""physical"" stuff.. not to mention i didn't had my dinner cos&nbsp;i was late rushing from amk. was supposed to meet the dive instructor but he dua jason and i!!! den i was already on my way. wah lao first time i reach on time someone dua me. see la. where got motivation to be early/on time again. ):

was at the stations that will be filled with guests first.. (cos the stations close earlier than the rest).. lucky got Jamos.. he die die also won let me carry the oval tray.. which is good. hahaa!! so i just clear and clear and clear all the plates to the oval tray den he will&nbsp;carry everything&nbsp;on the oval tray and send it back&nbsp;to the stewards for washing..&nbsp;and refilled the water and clear more plates.. serve tea serve coffee.. i just realise the fridge in the kitchen.. the handle is a bottle opener!! ZAI. haha new discovery!

4) 9.30!! time to clear the fingerbowls, maia glass, candle holders, olive oil and balsamic vinegar from the table.. cos the station is about to close.. (:

5) den i was suppose to clear more tables at the front station.. wah lao. 5 star hotel.. 1 star guests.. they eat like.. i dunno wat la. damn messy! my hands keep tio the food. wah laos. den the table is damn dirty. i keep clearing the tables.. and i clear the oval tray from the front station to the kitchen. woah. long way in mans. ok la. 2 oval trays for the night is enuff. damn shag liao after that.

6) i love it when Duty Captain ask me to ""put coffee cups and saucer""!! cos is like the easiest? and can do fast also.. heee.... 30 saucers on one arm at one go (arms short so cant carry anymore).. and 30 coffee cups on one silver tray.. (: (: i think there's 100++ seats&nbsp;for the&nbsp;2 stations..

7) den suddenly all the guests started to leave together. wah laos. den Jamos and the manager Vincent chop chop clear the tables while i clean and set back the placemats. lugged like 20+ placemats and a cloth for cleaning.. for round tables, the edge of the placemat must reach the golden line at the edge of the table; square tables.. the placemat on the left must overlap at the top RH corner.. den still must arrange the orchid, pepper, salt and sugar bowl. 5 star hotel and 1 star guests. they like to mess up the pepper, salt and sugar bowl i dunno why.. and have to place them correctly.. zzz not to mention all the stains on the table. i wiped until damn damn tired my left arm.

dunno why. but i carry tray on right hand and use my left hand to serve ppl de. dad says i'm borned a leftie. maybe. i cant carry the tray on the left hand. i think will just drop. is damn awkward.

8) after that.. YK ask me to top up cutleries at the 4 stations!! omg. i hate arranging fork and knives and spoons and making sure every station has almost equal no. of cutleries. drawer 1: spoons, small fork, small knives. drawer 2: spoons, big fork, big knives. drawer 3!!: butter knife, steak knife, oyster forks, chopstick rest, chopsticks, porcelain spoons and some other chapalangs.&nbsp;4 stations!!! wah lao still have to remember which station don't have what cutlery den top up appropriately..

9) den still got guests at other stations.. when they clear the oval tray into the kitchen i have to start cleaning them and topping them up into the various stations.. and where the stations have guests.. i cant push that trolley out to top up.. i have to slowly.. use the silver tray and carry all the cutleries to top up. the front stations are so bare that i have to go like how many times to fill them up.. ):

lucky uncle clean cutleries faster than me. else i can no need go home le wor.

10) there's this bugger group of guests.. they left like 1145!! we end our shift at midnight lor. wth!! den is like when they left.. 2 person clear the watever plates and stuff from the table and i clear the napkins. den after that.. 5 persons set back the tables. HAHAHA. speed man. else all cant go home.

-

totally and damn shag. this is not a typical night man. typical night is fold napkins until 8pm haha!! like stand on a spot and fold fold fold. LOL. too bad i'm not that new anymore. they will make me go ""on floor"". there's 2 more new staff today.. so they folded the napkins.

-
all these for a gross pay of $7.20 per hour. okay la. watever. i'm tired. time to go to bed."

ytd invited jb to give a workshop about first aid. after the workshop went home w weiye on the train. fwah. just as i got outta the train, there's this drunkard. he just WHAM ! walk into a pillar! den he fell backwards and bang his head against the panel of the door. the door was bloody hell closing la! i cannot imagine if he fell in btw the doors.. omg. that guy looked highly concussed. the auntie helped him up while i ran as fast as my legs cld carry me up to the control station to get the station control person for help. 

damn that fatty guy. he was taking his time to go down to look at the person! he even took a lift. and all he brought was this freaking walkie talkie. as if that would help the guy at all. 

pissed off w the person at the control station. grr. at least bring a first aid kit? i told them that a guy fell and bang his head!! and i tot i sounded extremely urgent. i really wanted to blast at them when i was like HELLO! into the stupid hole at the control station and no one even cared about me!! seriously. imagine if i tell them that i found&nbsp;a bomb. 

went down to take a look at the guy first. he went to st james power station.. and he said he had a black out. oO and dunno what he was doing. lucky for this another guy he was looking after him while i ran up to get the fatty. guess that guy needed a rest. not sure how that guy went home after that cos we left the guy with the fatty. -_- hope that fatty knows how to look after him! ok it's kinda wrong for me to leave the drunkard with a guy that i can't trust to look after him.. my bad. personal interest before others. ):&nbsp;

prolly warming his seat in the plane now. listening to the air stewardess on Emirates and kue shio-ing with all the arabs to Dubai for transit. haha. the nasty feeling creeps back when Shu Neng Shen Qiao and Yuan Lai is played on iTunes. the thing about songs for me is that.. i cannot remember titles and singers very well. i suck at linking song-title-singer. but song-memories when that song is played is strongly co related.

sigh. dropped 1 tear. like like.. okay. buck up emotionally girl."

""hey, how about we fix this windsurf guy up?""<br /><br />so we were fixing the windsurf guy up.. he cut the pieces out from the frame while i used my nailcutter to&nbsp;file the edges so that&nbsp;the part where u cut the pieces out from the frame&nbsp;doesn't jut out ugly-ly. for those who doesn't know what stikfas is.. simply google ""Stikfas"". It's a local brand toy.. so yeah i'm showing some support here.. got the box while visiting the Stikfas office cos i was doing my project last sem. and it's been there ever since.. wanted to fix it up after exams.. but didn't get the time..<br /><br />there's this irritating bugger piece that refused to fit itself into the joint!! my couz and i used up all our might. until he had to leave&nbsp;for home.&nbsp;leaving me, in perspiration and still quite determined on fitting that piece in. i was so desperate for a solution.. that i tried using my lotion (like vaseline) to smooth the thing so that it can fit in.. and i smsed vinvin if he got method to fit it in. realise he's in Taipei now.<br /><br />vinvin u like travelling loads!! enjoy your time at taipei!! (: (: (:<br /><br />and his suggestion: use my strength lor.<br /><br />and i tried.. and.. i FINALLY got it fitted into the joint. fwahhhh. thumb pain sia.<br /><br />fix the rest of the parts up.. pasted the stickers also.. looks not bad! (: did 1 of the figure that i could do with the number of pieces.. there's another figure that i could do but i'd prolly have to rest my thumb and fix it up another day.. hahaha. loser thumb.<br /><br />quite fun to move the joints of the figurine about..<br /><br />another screwed up part was the windsurf. i don't know how to explain it here.. there's supposed to be handles on both sides of the windsurf thingy.. but no matter how i tried initially.. it's still all on one side only.. until&nbsp;i squeeze squeeze the windsurf thingy into the handle.. resulted in abit peng-kok-ness.. -_-<br /><br />but okay la. the end product still looks not bad for a first timer doing Stikfas (i suppose) !! hoho. it's really fun fixing the figure up. then i tried to take a few photos of it.. the triumphant look of the figure that i fixed up. then i realised. dammit the figure is suppose to surf on water and i can't take it on land!! okay la that's lame. the figure can't stand up cos there's a piece at the bottom that's doesn't allow it to stand properly.<br /><br />some pictures of it.. i tried to take it on my bro's bed cos his comforter is blue that's something like the background.. windsurfing in water.. hahaha.. sorry there's zebras on the comforter.. abit anti climax.. haha<br /><br /><img height=""240"" alt=""windsurf 1"" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/00029x8g/s320x240"" /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/0002a1s6/""><img height=""240"" alt=""windsurf2"" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/0002a1s6/s320x240"" /></a><img height=""240"" alt=""windsurf3"" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/0002bztz/s320x240"" /><img height=""240"" alt=""windsurf4"" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/0002cp0r/s320x240"" /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/0002dyha/""><img height=""240"" alt=""windsurf5"" width=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/aud_2011/pic/0002dyha/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />looks cool right!! haha.. now i don't know what to do with it. thought of giving it to someone who windsurfs and is&nbsp;leaving soon for manchester. but then.. it's such an ugly piece of stuff and moreover it wasn't done by me totally.. my couz helped me cut the pieces..<br /><br />shall leave it on my table for admiration.. my first Stikfas character!!<br /><br />-<br /><br />now to pack up the remaining pieces.. clear my bed.. and continue reading.. hahaha<br /><br />-<br /><br />working on mon, tues and sun night. need to return my parents the money i loaned for diving.. and start saving for this year's birthday pressies.. it&nbsp;is going to be a high expenditure year.. where all my peers turn 21.<br /><br />tata!<br /><br />-<br /><br />darnn. i realise my maid's back in Indo. i need to learn how to bun my hair up MYSELF!!! oh shit oh shit.</p>"

"event","<p>it must have been.<br /><br />i went to school on a saturday (like.. like.. c'mon la!) it's a bright and sunny saturday.. i could have done so much more by not being in school. but i went back to school anyway.<br /><br />went to meet genevie and xinyu to talk about the log stuff today at suntec starbucks at noon. waited for 3pm so that xinyu and i can walk over to BK at millenia walk for OAC pub cell meeting (i'm no longer the OAC pub head but xinyu is.. cheers!). purpose: to pass bird my CL1101E textbook so that she can pass it to Nanda and Nanda can give her the money for the book where she will pass it back to me again. HAHA. stayed for the pub cell meeting. saw all the softcopies of the works of OAC06 pub stuff.. definitely brought back alot of memories as an ex pub head. twas a good experience for me. due to foresee&nbsp;heavy commitments from attachment in this long semester break.. i volunteered to be the log sub comm for OAC07 to render my manual labour and of course station master for RACE5~ (:<br /><br />after the meeting.. i went to school!! haha. by the time i reach school was already 5pm or so. i stayed at Central Library, searching books over Linc, dropping that slip of RBR paper into the RBR slot.. and smiling at the librarian for getting the books for me and photocopying the readings. it's dammit heavy la!! i photocopied until the machine just gave up on me and said ""load paper"". and i shifted to the next copier to continue my zapping. i spent like.. 10 bucks on merely 2 weeks of readings for 3 modules. and.. i only printed what i felt like reading. which is very little compared to what's given in the reading list.<br /><br />i must comment about the books that i copied. they are burning a hole in my pocket!!! why can't the books not be B5 size such that i cant squeeze 2 pages into 1 side? end up i blew the pages up by 120% so that i can read better, since i can't squeeze the pages into 1 side.&nbsp;some pages the words are freaking small that no matter how i tried to enlarge the page.. it still seems to be for ants to read. why can't the books weigh lighter so that flipping the pages is not so tiring!! why can't the hard cover books not be so hard cover that i can't press the spine of the book down properly so that there's no black shade in the centre of the page.. why can't the softback books be not so softback that the book just seem tooo flimsy to flip?! why can't the machine detect no words portions and not zap it (or create a black space)&nbsp;so that i don't have to put a piece of white paper at the bottom of the book that keeps moving each time i take the book out to flip??!<br /><br />exited the library at 8.20pm.. decided to walk to biz to catch a bus..walk walk walk. i got freaked out like a couple of times on my way to the HMK bus stop okay. if u are a self freaked out case like me. DO NOT. I REPEAT. DO NOT walk from arts to biz at night.&nbsp;<br /><br />was walking along the LT14 place there.. saw a couple and i think they are&nbsp;MUGGING together.. okay.. that's sweet but it's a saturday?!! (like.. like.. c'mon la!) then the ulu walk thru the old, quiet, noiseless passage way&nbsp;in the ex law school. if we walked there before.. i'm sure&nbsp;we all know that the corners are damn sharp turns.. and the passage way is like DEAD. i was half a time thinking if someone will just appear out of the sharp turn.. wah kao. it was like freaking me out la! i can't help but walk a bigger circumference so that i can see what's beyond the sharp turn at law school.<br /><br />den the journey past LT16 and 17.. kao. is like NOBODY.. no freaking soul in sight. den there's this stairs down towards the HSSML. bloody hell! no one switch on the lights and it's freaking dark la! half the time i was thinking.. ""will someone pop out from the side with a chloroform hankie and try to ambush me..?"" or ""will there be a rapist at the toilet and he will suddenly pop out...?"" and the other half of the time i was like ""SAVE ME!!!!!!!!!!"" and ""DAMMIT LEGS! CAN YOU WALK FASTER?!?!?!?!""<br /><br />i thought everything was fine when i saw street lamps and people under HSSML doing some stuff. then the&nbsp;road OUT to the bus stop. there's this flickering street lamp. time to change the bulb, i thought. but when a car drove past the street lamp, it miraculously stopped flickering!! sugoi right. FREAK LAHH!!!<br /><br />i think i do get very bimbotic and bitchy when i feel highly emotionally charged.<br /><br />-<br /><br />tis a bitchy day for me. shall go and organise the readings and read them.<br /><br />-<br /><br />do not ask me why nothing worked out. it didn't and i don't want to think about it. and do not call me ruddy because of that!! got me thinking again like on my way to school. argh.</p>"

WHAT THE HECK LA! term time hectic, exam period hectic. okay. i will survive. i am so not yet motivated to start reading. zzz.<br /><br />-<br /><br />about the lecturers<br /><strong>Dr Ng for 3201</strong> - still quite a good impression of her so far.. but foresee the lesson to be quite dry.. after all it's agency planning and development. sounds very much like my research mod last sem. seems quite strict.<br /><strong>Dr Nair for 3216 </strong>- 1 very happening woman. full of charisma and vibrancy. foresee a very eventful module with Nair.. not forgetting the tons of work that she has set already.. ""experiential driven module"", like what she said. and she also said ""those who took my 3211 module last sem.. i promise i will not kill you with the amount of work that&nbsp;i give you this sem.. (laughs)""<br /><strong>Dr Vasoo for 2103</strong> - mention Dr Vasoo to the rest of the people in SW, they will tell you ""it's a challenge to stay awake in his lectures"" but ""he's a very friendly lecturer"".&nbsp;i think he's super fluent in chinese, teochew, hokkien, cantonese, malay, tamil, and of course english.. whatever common languages used&nbsp;in Singapore, he can speak them very well! his voice is deep and low.. and rather monotonous.. words on the slides are small and font is Times New Roman.. no wonder so many people will be lulled to sleep in his lectures. i thought he really tried his best to raise some pitches.. but its still quite low. he can be quite blur too.. like uploading alot of stuff in the workbin but&nbsp;did not publish the workbin for the students to have access.<br /><strong>Dr Sim for 2003</strong> - i think he's trying hard to be.. entertaining.. i don't know. i find myself at loss to react to his words today. and he's an engineer grad..decision science pHD..&nbsp;and he bragged about his algorithms and programmes!! omg!<br /><strong>Dr Chung for 1001</strong> - i thought he's kinda entertaining. and i think he reused his slides like 100,000 times already.. cos Dias told me what to expect for his lecture today and it turns out to be quite true. haha. i had to indicate in his survey which photo i preferred - him in suit or w/o suit. thought that his mod will be kinda really work driven kind.<br /><br />-<br /><br />tutorial balloting time!<br /><br />-<br /><br />looking forward to a very very exciting semester ahead.."

"event","<p>blows away some dust collected here.. haha<br /><br />was away to a chalet from 4th till this morning.. idea was to have a meeting and enjoyy! yes my half yearly retreat. i'm abit lazy to blog about the whole thing so i will just summarise it in a few&nbsp;paragraphs.<br /><br />terry's meeting ended pretty early (for once). covered some reviews and previews.. i heaved a sigh of relief after trying my best to come up with the&nbsp;stuff i needed to do for&nbsp;the whole night before the meeting (after eating tauhuay) and settled the post activities administration (diving and ophir). was pretty efficient thru the night of preparations. heaved a sigh of relief because things looks less bleak to me now, and i'm more confident to know where the club is moving&nbsp;off from here (after preparations and retreat). alot is dependent on the comm now. else it will be NATO. the direction is there. let's think of ways to remove that barrier, that initial inertia to get work done. <u>get&nbsp;organised and get work done</u>.&nbsp;sem 2 can only get busy. but it's my personal desire to want the club to grow from here onwards.<br /><br />peer appraisal was kinda fun. i like reading wat i read. it can only be good for myself to improve. and i even got personalised appraisal from birdy on the ride to her home on bus 12. hahaha.<br /><br />we had too much time to rot.<br /><br />1st night - dias was sick that he went to hosp for a drip.&nbsp;terry and jason&nbsp;went to CGH to bring his stuff for him and after that&nbsp;the rest of the&nbsp;guys hopped onto darren's car and all the guys went to 85 to eat. while they were away, i was busy learning canto from ah san and co. ruddy birdy only know 1 line ""gam yat, dai ka ho hoi sum ah! (today, all of us are happy)"" den audrey ang went ""gam yat, dai ka.. gam bui! (today, everyone cheers)"" basically we went mad. the guys came back with a packet of COCONUT BUN, initially. we thought they damn bo sim. until darren held the bak chor mee and the carrot cake! weee! great supper. after that all the girls went mad and started piling up on the bed. den we slpt. cldn't slp. cos ppl were snoring beside me. and the both of them could really make up a ""snoring orchestra"".<br /><br />2nd afternoon and night - after the meeting ended, all had lunch, then some of us played pool.. den we went to kick some soccer and played captain ball. it was dinner at sakae den Terry and I couldn't take it anymore.. too tired. so we went to rest, while the rest wanted to go the Red House. but they came back la dunno why also. den it was hella noisy i couldn't slp. den i helped jason play abit of asshole daidee (wasn't the prostitute, beggar nor the asshole wee!) while he went to look for jan.. hmm. den i slpt till 10 plus am when i woke up to realise it was bidding round 2C!! my 2 biz mods. haha<br /><br />sorry seniors we din hold a bbq.. so your monies from cartel meeting is still with me. we'll try to hold it during the 2nd retreat!<br /><br />-<br /><br />bidding was madness. i really just gave up and threw in my points and left 4 points in my G account. now.. i got all my mods yeah no prob.. but.. its madness. i dunno how many points i'm left with for the next sem. argh. but watever it is now. i'm just going to do my best this sem first.<br /><br />-<br /><br />went to cor's bday party today. i'd say, great food and finally meeting up with my class girls. at first i felt abit weird uh. cos they were talking about.. their bangkok trip. and after missing so many class outings. but after abit of warming up i was fine already.<br /><br />HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CORINNE, JIN WEN (whose birthday party i had to give a miss due to cor's bday party) and YU PERNG (my adjam buddy)! (:<br /><br />too bad i can't make it to Joanne's birthday party on 27th. Hippo's birthday party is a must go. (:<br /><br />-<br /><br />Diving tmr at Pulau Hantu. Hope i don't get lost in the waters and hope i don't get fcuking rashes.<br /><br />-<br /><br />School reopens officially on 8th Jan 07. School officially begins on 9th Jan 07 for me and ends on 26th Apr 07. Study hard Audrey.<br /><br />-<br /><br />I'm interested in Vertical Marathon on 25th Feb.

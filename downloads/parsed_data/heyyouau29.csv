today stunk, as lynnette's did too, she told me so.

i had a very weird dream involving a lot of ppl...i told some ppl, and its a pathetic dream, ask me if u wanna know.

also ask about the hockey story with my dad, it waz pretty much a rated NC-17 game...long story.

monday will be good, band long hour...

i hav to work tonite!  and i couldnt go to the movies, or someone's house to watch a movie, and it all makes me really sad...waa, sob, tear, cry

Independent study waz so quiet today...it waz just me and rakel, even MR. Davey's classes weren't there!  But lynnette visited, and still, it waz quiet.

I lead a very odd, strange, messed up life.  wat r my goals?  Wat do i need?  Wat do i want?  Wat will make me happy?  and Wat's the right thing to do, so i feel good about myself?  do u ever ask ur self those?  cause i do it all the time, but now especially.  I feel so confuzed, and mislead that its not funny.

kk well i g2g be bored and listen to music in the scorekeepers booth...o!  if u ever wanna come to a game and keep me company...thats absolutely fine, just ask me wen my next game is!  And u'd probably hav a ride there.  The ride home is a deffinite, because we need to go home too, and there's no rush.  I usually get out at about midnight.  And there's usually half an hour break b4 and after the double games.  So we just occupy ourselves.  meghan and dave and jordan and andy and chris and jon know all about the games, becuase i've taken them.  they're fun!  just call up ur local travel agent at 17813448424, or 17818569624, whichever one is cooler.  i love u all.  unless i dont...

o!  almost forgot the last thing...zeeland quote.  i saw other ppl's lj's quoting him, so today i quoted him.  he said...

""It would be no different, except the answer would vbe different, there.  i feel accomplished...and confuzed, but thats about somethin else.

You are a sock.



You are a cozy, fuzzy, warm-hearted person. A lot of your friends describe you as a hopeless romantic. You fall for the opposite sex very easily. But be careful, because usually you don't know what you are getting into, and because you are very sensitive, you can get hurt... especially in early relationships. Also, don't exclude the cold-hearted from your ""want-list"", because they just might be looking for a kind person to warm up their heart.... or a sock to warm up their feet.

Life is a long and winding road.
It has unexpected
turns
hills
bumps
and other things.
Sometimes you have to make choices.
Which path?
Will you take the downhill or uphill?
left or right?
will you go back or go forward?
Sometimes you have to pay tolls.
Many times you see other cars fall into sinkholes.
but you have to make the choice of helping them, or going around it.

Sometimes you get turned down for something you really want.
You lose something thats very important to you.
That special thing you want leaves for the total opposite thing.
You lose that love that you hoped for.

You see someone struggling and you try to help.
But they don't want your help.
You come to understand that you can't help everyone

You can never change who somebody is, never.

But all in all you learn to accept it.
It's a fact of life.
And we move on.

Enjoy life to the fullest, and treasure every moment.
Every time you want what you can't have, you move on.

I love you all.  And this is my life."

"event","If u werent on the last one, see if ur on this one!

1)I love u so much!  pretty much as a friend, but i like u here and there.  U probably wouldn't consider me like that especially after we went out, and pretty much barely gave ourselves a chance.  I think that we just weren't comfortable then.  But over this year so far, we're amazing friends, and we can't let go of such a great relationship!

2)I've had some funny times with u!  Even tho u dont talk a lot, u say hello by kicking or pushing me, and i consider it ur signature hello.  We've had some very strange phone and text message convos, but we know that that's all for laughs!  Ur a good friend,  i wish could be better friends.

3)U are a fun fun fun person to be around.  I've only been around ur house a few times, and wish that we could hang out more.  That handshake is hilarious!  It's great!  Love ya!

4)You help me wen i'm down, and we share the same wavelength, ""because we're good like that""! lol I love u, ur a great person to be around and always are positive even wen ur down.  Thats y we need to stick together forever, and never give up.

5)U probably wont even read this.  But i dont know how good of a friend u r to me, but i still consider u one.  I wish u would accept me more, and u could understand me, ubt i guess we just rn't best friends and thats fine.  

6)Ur an amazing singer!  I love u with all my heart, and even tho u may be strange and loud sometimes, i love ya neway.  We've known eachother since 6th grade and i knew u would be a great friend of mine one day.

7)Tho u may be very short, ur not alone.  U r one of the most optimistic people i hav ever met.  And thats a really good thing!  I respect u for ur talent, and how ur liked by everyone.  I love the way u talk some times.  Ur osome.  

8)ok, i wanna wish u congratulations on everything.  U seem like u hav found someone who may not be everyone elses choice, but a person, who can love and respect u in an unforgetable way.  Ur very lucky to be like this right now.  I am happy for u and hope u stick together for the rest of eternity.

9)My god!  ur so tall!  But that has nothing at all to do with me saying that ur osome.  And u can be extremely ditsy a lot, and that's wat makes u individual.  Ur so funny, and im really gonna miss u wen i graduate

10)U dont go to my school, ur actually far far far away from here.  Ever since we were little we would get along famously.  Im glad our moms were so close back then, and im glad and happy to be so fortuanate to have a great friend like u."

"event","ok, im gunna do that 15 friends thingy....but i dont hav 15 friends on my livejournal friends list, so i'll just do ppl i know that r friends..............................

1)you are very very very talented and i respect you for that.  I say i hate u, but i really dont.  U r a great person and i just look up to u so much in so many ways, but not litterally...ur not that much taller than me.  I also want u to know that i ave potential to like u but i hold back, so nothing will ever happen.  Believe me, it's for the best.

2)you are a very good friend to me.  even tho u may act a little strange sometimes, or all the times...i still really want u to know ur a great friend, and a great person.  never forget...

3)you are my bestestestestest friend since we were like 6 months old.  you're so talented, and ur gunna be great and very successful wen ur older.  tho we may have all these little fights, u know that it's all part of being so close.  groing up with u all these years is a blessing.  i thank u for that.  

4)i met u last year through jazz band and through a good friend.  Tho u went thru hard times with him, and other ppl, and all this stress going on now, u need to know i back u up 100%.  I wish u the best of luck as u move on in life and i want u to be the most happy person in the world.  Despite that u may hate me, i still love u.  maybe not like a girlfriend, but more as a great friend.

5)we realized that we weren't meant for eachother wen we went out, but once we broke up, we were never closer.  Though u may have a tough family life, u should remember ur family lies within ur relatives, and all ur friends.  Ur such a great person, and u hav so much going for u in life.  Treasure that forever.

6)you are just something else!  ur very very funny.  Everytime i physically hurt u (which is like everyday) is always an accident.  I never would want to inflict pain upon u.  That's y its so funny.  U hav a very nice boyfriend.  Tho he's not a big dancer, he seems like a great person.  Never take him for granted.  Enjoy all that time with him and enjoy ur life.

7)you are very confusing.  and i mean wicked waicked confusing.  I dont know wat u want at all.  U drive me crazy.  Partly cause i really like u.  Also because wat u do to me.  I dont hate u, so dont take it that way.  I really just wanna sit and talk with u and get everything settled.  Im also very afraid that ur ruining ur life, and i want to help look out for u cause i care about u.  And i dont wanna see u hurt for the millionth time.  BTW, nice job at the concert on friday!

8)you!  you gross me out sometimes, but ur a great friend!  very very loyal.  i hope that u will find a girl one day, since u never had a girlfriend.  People just make fun of u because their insecure about themselves.  Like me.  Im sorry for all the times i did that.  I know u could pummell me, and i respect u for putting up with me all these years.  really, i love u man!

9)you are a very funny kid.  we were shorto buddies since like 1st grade, and weve stuck together thru all of the up times and all the down times.  Now since u moved, we're closer than ever, litterally.  As long as u promise to wear lots of deodorant and shower, i'll hang out with u more.  I promise.

10)Ok, i hate u so bad.  U are a little piece of shit.  Sometimes u can be nice, but we're only nice to eachother because we intimidate eachother.  Though ur wicked taller than me and u could kick my ass, u need to repect me more, cause next year, if things go as planned, im gunna be ur section leader, and ur gunna hav to put up with it.  And stop messing up all of my friends!  u have to learn some respect towards others.  Girls and boys.  come on!

11)U helped me all last year, but u were a horrible leader and a horrible influence.  Im sorry but wen i tried to look up to u, it didnt work.  U are so childish in ur ways.  Uve messed up a lot of girls and a lot of lives, and a lot of skin.  Ur bruises kill!  I do wish that ur life turns around for the better.

12)Ur a very nice person.  people talk trash about u a lot, but i dont know really wat to think of u.  Despite all the crap, u still are my friend, and i really repect u.  Ur a very nice person, and u really convinced me to go to the semi, and i thank u for that.  I need to give u more money than that.  I owe u one!

13)U say uve liked me for 3 years, that's a very long time!  I have to say i like u on and off.  That really pisses me off, because ur pretty much a perfect girl for me.  But sometimes u really scare and intimidate me, i guess thats the turnoff but i know ur very smart and will be very successful wen ur older.

14)i dont know wat to say about u.  It all started last year.  By the end i couldn't hold it in nemore, so it got out and everyone found out i liked u.  Over the summer i couldnt stop thinking about u, and then wen i saw u for the first time again during band camp, i waz too shy to talk to u.  All this because ur the only girl i could ever look at and say that i waz in love.  I'd think about u and it distracted me from watever i waz doing.  I used to think u were the most beautiful girl in the world.  But after all the crap we poked at eachother and the thing that went on during the marching season, i hav to say that i hate u with a passion.  Its a strange passion tho.  I still barely talk to u cause i still like u.  Not nearly as much, but i like u, and i just get all tensed up around u.  Id rather it all be gone away.

15)Ok, ur not really a kid friend of mine.  Mainly cause ur not a kid.  Though u may be very strange sometimes, i look up to u in so many ways.  Uve taught me to be strong, and to believe in wat i do.  Last year waz really the first year i got to know u, and now i can say that ur very starnge, and i really really respect u.  I know u think i'm very odd, and thats probably because wen im around u i act like a soldier.  U intimidate me but in a very influential way, and i respect that."

Latin long hour dragged on forever.  Im gunna retake that chem quiz Zeeland gave our failing class.  The class average waz in the 30's!  Wow.  So i had lots of fun last weekend!

A lot of stuff happened that night, everyone that went probably knows.  Know everything is strange and different.  A good different, but kinda odd.  Well, we will see wat happens!  Life takes very unexpected turns.  This waz one that i didnt see... lisa already knows...and lets say sumone may be very happy, but maybe not happy enough...i don't know.  I'll see wat happens.  Im wicked tired by the way, and i really need a back massage.  Everyone who reads this has to post comments!!!!!!!!! I wanna hear.  This is the first one!"

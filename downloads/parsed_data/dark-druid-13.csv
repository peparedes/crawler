"event","So this past week sucked on quite a few levels but was good on one or two.  My grandmother passed away on friday, before i had a chance to see her one last time, got to spend easter with family that i havent seen in a long time.  Monday was the wake, Tuesday was the funeral at which i was a pall bearer (not fun).  but i got to meet this really cool and cute girl Casey, and I got to see my cousin meagan ( my lil rebel princess) and her brothers matt and paul, and Paul's girlfriend brittany.

"event","I know, it's been forever since I last posted, but here's what's up:

First of all, the Kenny Concert was awesome.  We ended up in the upper section, with a birds eye view of the stage, but we still had a great time.  

Since then, I got a job at Burger King on the closing shift which is pretty cool, considering I can get a discount on my food.  

I started my third year at FSC, so good so far, thinking about switching my major from psychology to philosophy or communications media.

The icing on the cake, though, was Locobazooka.  Why, you ask?  Not just because the Dropkick Murphy's co-headlined with Disturbed, but because I got on stage with the Dropkick Murphy's.

Til next time, (I promise, it won't be another 3 months!)"

You may whine at times, but you've developed a thick hard shell (like that of a crab).
You are strong willed and persistent - until you get what you want.
You never shy away from a fight, even when things get dangerous.
Mentally sharp, you are starting to master the elements of mind manipulation.

So anyways, the show was in tewksbury and there were 2 other bands there, Reaxis and Exhale.  Reaxis was OK but Exhale rather sucked.  By the time Dogfight came on it was 11 o'clock, I was right up front, not even 2 feet from the guys.  Plus I got to meet the lead singer Mike and the drummer Danny!! I'm still a little sore from all the head rocking.  The website is http://www.dogfightband.com, check it out!

A lil bit of advice to all my pals that will be going to college soon (Kaila, Matt, Bridgie, Maggie, Britney, etc), Avoid Eight o clock classes at all costs, they suck!!!  I'll survive tho.  Once I get used to waking up at 6 in the morning.  AHHHHHH!!! It's High School all over again!"

Well, I survived the flight home from Alabama, and I am now enrolled in classes at FSC for this semester.

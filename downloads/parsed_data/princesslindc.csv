short and sweet update.
finals are good. not too hard. i love my dance finals.
it is about -2 degrees here and there has been snow all over the place for over a month. when you go outside, it sort of hurts to breath cuz it is so cold. i have never been in this cold of weather.
sometimes i wonder why i am going to this school cuz it is so darn cold. good thing i am coming home for winter.
i am thinking about applying to byu-hawaii for the summer... we'll see.
that is crazy that in a couple weeks i am done with my freshman year of college.
i will miss the new friends but i am excited to see the old. it'll be weird not to see the people i have lived with/hungout with/ dated since june for 4 months.

i am excited to see my brace-faced,weighs less than me mother and my shaved head father. they are going through mid life crisis really bad since i've been gone.

things are crazy right now until the 18th (that's when i come home).

the end.
hope to see all ya crazy folks soon."

"event","i quit cheer. i went to practice today (which was soooo lame)..practiced, got my uniform fitted, and when they told us to go run.... that was my que to quit. so i walked over to the locker rooms and left. hah. take that.

but i must say... I am in love with my dance classes.

funny story... so i got an email from brad yesterday and he told me he fell off his bike and got 7 stitches in his chin. haha. sort of sad i guess. less than a year till he comes home. coolio. and cameron... he just hit his 6 month mark. slooooow.

i love my mother. she orders, pays, and has my groceries delivered to my apartment.

the roommates and i had a discussion tonight and set some rules. half of my apartment are virgin lips. only at a mormon school. not that the V.L. thing had to do with setting rules.

i love tiger milk bars. delish!

i have learned that guys are so much easier to be friends with. guy friends are better than girl friends. for the most part.

                       Jazz
                       Tap

16 credits in total (that's not counting the dance classes... they don't really count)
soooo i've got a lot ahead of me. :)
i might be dropping one of those communication classes before the semester starts because i would really like to have a social life too. :)

i can't remember the last time i went to bed before 3 am. oh gosh.
i'm coming home on the 19th. :)"

things are great. classes are getting harder which really stinks. it's so crammed over summer. but i make sure to save time to have fun. i'm getting no sleep but i don't really care. i love my roommates. i have 3 from different places in idaho and then i have one from las vegas and one from louisiana. they are all so sweet. and we through stupid parties for every single thing possible. next week is the laguna beach season 2 party. can't forget that one.
my cooking is getting better. top ramen is no longer a food staple. pasta is. i love pasta. the apartments are nice and we just decorated our living room and kitchen. it's sooo nice having your own room. i love it. girls are messy. 
""24"" the t.v. series is addicting.

many good looking boys here. i miss home, family, friends, and beach.... but i really like it here. i really really do. i'll be home august 19th through the 30th or something like that.
peace out."

had musical rehearsal today...first time with the band!thank heaven i didn't have to sing today because i have no voice. singing w/the band gave us a little clue of how much more we have to work on and it's coming up really soon! first weekend of march soooo come and see it!!

3 more weeks for cameron till he goes off to the MTC (missionary training center). sad to see him leave but i'm so excited for him!

it was so nice talking to brad on christmas and i realized that he has not changed. it is still the same brad. i was worried he was gonna be all weird but he's not. so the whole family got to talk to him and it was wonderful. 

i love spending time with family....

"event","the weeks get so long before winter break. and i'm really not in the mood right now to rummage through the garage to find some ""snow day"" gear. And thats just lame that there is no ""roll out of bed"" day. thats my fav.
Sooo asb bon fire was fun (for those who weren't on something).:) and we ended up throwing everything into the fire like last year. fun stuff.

work was early on saturday morning but it goes by so much faster when u work earlier.nest week my shift starts at 6am in the morning! i missed mcdonald's breakfast menu by like 3 minutes so i was pretty bummed about that. then last night cameron and i went to starbucks and then walked around starlight circle. and we played ""horse"" (but we turned it into ""slut"") and i won. cameron is a big fat slut. :)

 i have a solo this tuesday but no voice. its not coming back...:("

"event","well i  love the rain if i'm not wet. if i'm not wet then i don't like it. well i take that back. cameron and i walked in the rain on saturday night with our apple cider and it was fun sooooo i don't know. and i  don't like it if it rains on our bonfire.

on that note...Kevin and i are going shopping for bonfire stuff. any ASBers have any suggestions? (we are not buying any watermelons this year because they will probably end up in the fire along with all the other food/sodas/pizzas. and i really don't wanna see watermelons flying above my head again. it was fun though) :)

I can't wait till wed. if my mother okay's it.

 Yesterday when i went to my car (after passing out greenery) there was a note on it.hah. so junior high but funny. it said something like "" i loved you since freshman year....blah blah blah, love, Justin."" i'm thinking who the heck is justin and there was a # on it too. so the group of little freshman boys were telling me to call it  and so i did. and.... it was one of the freshman boy's cell phone....ha ha. little freshman boys, so funny. :) what a funny little trick.

why can't i do my homework at home? it ends up being ""period before work"".

And i still am sad that my mother brought me KFC for lunch yesterday and someone in the asb room didn't tell it was there and then ate it.i didn't even know she brought it till i got home.grrrrrr... don't get between me and my food nor me and my lunches brought by my mother. booooo on you."

so on saturday, a group of friends and cameron and i went to the Christmas on the Prado. so much fun. and cameron got to visit the Phillippine house. we also got to eat lupas (sp? phillipino food) there which are soooo good. so far from talking to other people who have gone there for their missions, cameron has found out that there are monkeys there ( he should bring one home with him :) ), there are really really big rats, they sometimes where flip flops, he wont being wearing a full suit because it is so hot and humid, Tagalog (the language he will speak) is super hard,  and while he's there he will be eating dog. my goodness. so exciting!(not the dog part but everything else)

christmas is coming soon and i'm surprising cameron! i would write what i'm doing for him but every once in a while he reads this thing so i won't.
  
i'm working everyday this week except tuesday which is nice because i need christmas money bad.

Everyone in my house is getting the 24-hour flu. so sad . i somehow manage to never get it(goodthing). Other than the jamba juice incident, i haven't thrown up since like 7th grade or so(another good thing). nor had the flu. faked it, yes. had it, no.

asb bonfire this friday yes?"

If you don't have a livejournal account and would like not only to continue reading but also to become my official, livejournal-sanctioned Friend, you can create your own journal here: https://www.livejournal.com/create.bml. It's free and you never have to write in it.

So, yeah, if you're not already, ""comment to be added"" and all that business.</lj-cut>"

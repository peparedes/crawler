"event","I don't write much anymore.  Josh and John keep me busy and it seems like there is always something that needs to get done like doing the dishes or ironing clothes.  If I haven't spoken to you in awhile, things are going well for us.  I'm not too good at keeping in contact with people.

I'm 29 now and not really bothered by how close the number is to 30.  Honestly, I think it's because I have a wonderful son that brings me so much joy everyday.  We're excited about the little one that is due in September.  It's hard for us to imagine loving another child as much as we love John.  They will be about 16 months apart and hopefully they will be close and enjoy playing with each other.  We recently decided to deliver the baby at a birthing center.  I love my doctor that delivered John and have much confidence in her.  However, I would like to avoid all of the annoyances from staying at the hospital after delivery.  Also, I am confortable with the birthing center because my doctor is one of the two doctors they call if there are any complications that the midwives can not handle.  This past year when we changed insurance companies and plans, we did not anticipate having a child so soon, so we opted for a health plan that did not cover maternity care.  Birthing centers are much more afordable.  It's also nice because I want to deliver naturally without medication like last time once again.  I wish labor was not so painful and tiring.

Currently, we are waiting to close on a house.  I'm anxious to move and ready to ""nest"".  The closing date is either the 25th or 29th.  I am fearful the date may be pushed a few weeks farther because of the survey.  The lender was supposed to provide the survey and requested it from us.  They generally take about 3 weeks.  Josh and I have experience in Commercial Real Estate having to order them, so we know that it has to be done early.  I am annoyed since I was hoping to have his grandparents and a few little kids over for John's 1st birthday during the first week of May.  I sent the invitations out and may have to call everyone and move the party to a park.  I guess it was a little ambitious thinking I could have everything ready by then."

"event","This weekend entailed a bachelorette party and bridal shower.  I admit I am not savvy with wedding etiquette even after going to several bridal showers and having my own shower.  I tend to get a little confused when it comes to the bridal shower gift.  Some gift givers bring a little gift for the bride, while others bring their wedding gift.  In my previous experience, the latter occurred with more frequency.  With this in mind, I gathered it was convenient and acceptable to bring the bride's wedding gift to the shower.  She opened all except one of her gifts.  She exclaimed it was the guest giver's main gift, and it was best to open it later with the groom.  I found myself in a predicament.  In my opinion, I spent a good amount of money on the gift I gave to her that day.  The thought of having to spend another $50 on another gift troubles me.  This is one of three weddings we were invited to for this month.  It would not bother me so much if I were part of the wedding party.  Initially, I was asked to be a bridesmaid.  However, I was demoted to guest soon after.  I should not complain.  This is a happy event.  I will resort to the etiquette book.  Anyhow, I need to refresh myself on table cutlery.  The other day while we were eating at the French Room, I was a slightly bewildered by the fish fork.  Also, I began to question whether or not the silverware was set for just the 5 dishes or also for the chef's complimentary dish at the beginning.  I have also forgotten how to properly hold wine glasses.  

We visited Reunion Tower for part of the bachelorette party.  I felt like a tourist once again.  There is something refreshing about being somewhere new and unfamiliar.  My sensory organs twice as well as normal and have the memory of an elephant.  At this moment, I can mentally put myself in La Jolla in the early evening during early October.  I hear waves crashing and feel the humidity on my skin along with the temperate breeze.  I also remember the light moisture from the fog.  I should stop day dreaming.  

Oktoberfest was fun.  The Paulaner's Oktoberfest beer was pretty good.  I missed out on the beer tasting.  I am always up for taste comparisons on food and beverages.  I recently tried the Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale and thought it was good too.  Pumpkin beer reminds me of the time I visited Seattle.  Nick should move back from Washington.  I feel like drinking coffee right now... an Americano would be nice at this moment.  I should buy an espresso maker someday.  I would need to get the timing down.  I could figure out how to do a ristretto.  I should ask Jen M."

We attended PCPC in the morning.  We were running late so we missed service.  Following church, we went to Sara H. and Brian T.'s wedding at White Rock Lake.  I have always loved property with a waterfront view.  The ceremony was sweet.

Yi-Chien, Natasha, Nina, Josh, John, and I took a tour of the Meyerson.  Surprisingly, the tour was more entertaining than I had originally imagined, and I assumed the tour would be good.  I have been to the Meyerson so many times, but never saw the building in such detail.  I somehow missed the amazing architectural details.  We also looked at the Thanksgiving Square chapel, which too had great architectural design.  The colorful stained glass spiraling upward was gorgeous.  After taking our tours, we met up with my parents for Pho.  Proceeding dinner, Josh and I watched ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".  I always enjoy the movie.  However, the quick camera motions always give me a headache and make me nauseous.  I should have known better before I got to the theater.  We were surprised that the theater we visited only charged us $10 for two tickets.  Their matinee price for adults is $3 and in the evening the rate is $5.  The place has stadium seating and decent sound.  This find was just as good as the $1 movie rentals at the machines in Tom Thumb.

Josh turned 28 years old.  We went to his parents' house for dinner.  We also visited his grandma at the nursing home.  She is always so happy to see us and especially John."

Alicia came over and met John for the first time.  Oddly, only a few people have met him.  John was intrigued and entertained by Alicia's beautiful bassoon playing.  I still haven't played violin for him yet.  He likes it when we play piano and guitar for him.  Sometimes Josh sings and plays kid songs for him.  Saturday evening, we had dinner with Alicia and Yi-Chien at a Thai restaurant in close proximity called Chan Thai.  The food was mediocre for the price, in my opinion.

We attended church at PCPC.  James had a baseball birthday party by his house, so we made sure to join in on the fun.  I had my first veggie burger.  The vegan cakes were pretty tasty.

We spent the day with Vanessa.  We had lunch at Royal Thai and went shopping at North Park mall.  Then, we made dinner at home and forced Vanessa to watch several episodes of ""So You Think You Can Dance"" with us.  I think the tomato and peppers soup was a hit.  Vanessa looked hot!  Too bad she broke off our engagement, and I'm married now.

Nina got her driver's license.  Mom, Nat, Nina, John, and I had lunch at Kings.  I shopped at Target for the hundredth time this week.

Natasha got her driver's license.  We hung out at Border's books and tried a restaurant called Lover's Eggroll.  I thought the food was less than mediocre.  I did like that I could watch Wheel of Fortune while eating food.  While watch ""So You Think...,"" one contestant danced to Rocket Summer, and I was pleasantly surprised.

"event","First off, I'm sick and hating it.  I caught what Josh has or had.  He is fortunate that he had his wisdom teeth pulled out on Monday, because the dentist gave him antibiotics to prevent infection.  I think the medication is also helping him get over his cold.  Being pregnant and all, I can't really take any medication, so I'm forced to kick it on my own.  I really hope i get over it in the next few days, before I have to go through labor.

We intended on purchasing a house two months ago and have attempted a few ways of getting financing for the house.  Things would have gone smoothly if banking laws hadn't changed in March.  Today, we told the seller that the deal is dead.  We will continue living in the apartments and hopefully in a few months, find a house that is has more character and space.  A baby really doesn't need that much room during the first few months, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.  

There is so much stuff to sort through and sell.  We are downsizing again.  We have too much stuff and are learning how to use space efficiently.  Craig's list is my friend.

We have visitors staying with us for about a week at one of the most hectic times of my life.  I feel overwhelmed.  i am due on the 10th, which is in 8 days.  The doctor says I need to walk 45 min. to an hour a day.  I haven't done that because i'm sick.  I changed doctors last week and regret not doing it sooner.  i wish i was better coached for natural childbirth.  i am dreading the pain.

i am tired of being helpless and unable to do many things.  i may not be able to attend nina's graduation."

last week, we played at the cavern with Mi & L'au and The Small Stars.  The people from both bands were really nice.  I really liked Mi & L'au and was happy we played with them.  in february, we played at the Wreck room with professional juice and numbers twist.  i'm sad just thinking that brian is gone and won't be back.  i'm going to miss him.  on the 25th, we're playing some kinky friedman voting event and then somewhere else in fort worth.  

josh is finally writing again, which makes me jump up for joy.  he has so much talent.  tony w. wrote some of his own songs that i'm looking forward to hearing.  i'm looking forward to this collaboration.  too bad brian isn't around to play with them like planned.  i'm not sure what part i play in it, but i know it will be fun.

i'm happy about j's enthusiasm to write music.  i'm trying to be encouraging and am always really happy to see how everything materializes.  i'm looking forward to that project also.

today, i visited with lisa n.  i like where she and john are living.  i was so excited to see her name on a law journal publication.  i really hope to see her again this week.  i miss her as a roommate.  i'm not complaining about my current roommate.  he's awesome.

i am sick of studying and reading.  i hate tests.  i want to burn all of my books.  i also am sick of having to work.  i want a vacation from everything."

"event","i decided it's time to make an entry.

there never seems to be enough time in the day to get everything done.  i'm hoping to get less hours at work, since it's the least important to me.  i just need it to help pay a few bills.  Right now, I'm taking about 15 hours of classes.  It's good for me, except extremely time consuming.

Friday night, we're playing at the Wreck Room in Fort Worth with Brian's band ...  i just went blank and am falling asleep.  i guess that happens when you wake up at 4:45 am.  i guess this is all for now."

"event","i went to the doctor this morning and got new pills.  now i'm on cefzil (cefprozil).  hopefully, it will work better than the ketek and amoxicillin.  for someone that tries to avoid medicines, i have taken so many different kinds of drugs since november.  i actually like zicam and nasonex.  i might buy some more.  i do hate the d in claritin, but it seems to be the only thing that works.

i feel like an emotional basket case.  i don't want to talk to anyone and want to hide behind my big, dark sunglasses.  i find myself listening to elliot smith, descendents, and jawbreaker and feeling very meloncholy.  the only thing i really want to do is sit outside in the sun and write a song.  it's so beautiful outside it makes me want to cry.  i don't want to go to work and lack a passion to do anything but read, write, or play music.  i now understand why i always find myself quitting jobs and not wanting to talk to anyone at all of my places of employment.  

as every year, i have a rough draft version of my new year's resolution list.  
- join the 24 hour fitness down the street this week and attend it at least 3 times a week.  you gotta love the elliptical machine.  in turn, i hopefully will lose 10 pounds of fat and gain a little muscle.  i also will feel less tired and feel good physically. 
- master the art of cooking curries
- improve my fiddlin' skillz (various styles)
- create a personal musical style and be more creative
- learn how to actually tap dance from an instructor
- learn how to improvise with ease
- keep a tidy house
- keep organized with shopping lists and eliminating clutter
- be more active in my church
- serve others and help those in need more
- buy a house
- overall be more productive and efficient with my time
- spend more time with family and friends
- be happy"

"event","i'm sick once again and not having fun.  i have neon green snot and an obnoxious cough.  

i guess i'm just in a crumby mood.  i haven't sent christmas cards to my family, i'm too tired and sick to be productive, and i can't find enough time in the day to get everything done.  

whine, whine, whine.  oh and what stinks the most is that i can't taste food right now.  i can't tell if food has salt in it, and i can't taste the root beer and ice cream in my float.  i really feel for those people that can never taste their food because they can't smell.

i need to talk to vanessa.  i'm sick though and don't know when i'm sleepying or not.  

i hope natasha and nina like our christmas tree."

"event","...still sick.  Today, I sat in front of the boob tube and wasted the day in hopes that my body would fight off whatever I have.  It's really hard to intentionally be unproductive.  

Wednesdays are always fun because I enjoy playing music with Curtis, Jay, and James.  TJ is fun too, but he's been too busy with work lately.  I feel fortunate I get to collaborate with people that are extremely talented and love playing music.  Their musical creativity inspires me and challenges me - both reasons why I have such a great time.  I am now looking for tap shoes to use in one of the songs.  Also, I am working on writing a ragtime piano part.  Lots of fun!"

"event","<b>I am sick.</b>
It started last week and became a problem after I yelled at middle school kids.  I don't remember the kids being so talkative and disrespectful when I was that age.  My current reasoning is they are in regular classes and from a different socio-economic upbringing.  I don't understand why many of them don't care to learn and apply themselves.  Whatever the case, I lost my voice Thursday.

I have felt miserable the past few days.  Saturday, I went to the Meyerson with Alicia and had a coughing attack during the first Schubert piece.  I felt like I was going to die.  I stepped out and didn't return.  I was fearful of causing a disturbance; I sat near the front in the orchestra section.  

I have tried several remedies for my killer coughing and congestion from Claritin D to Robitussin to Peppermint Schnaps.  The shot of Peppermint Schnaps worked the best.  I wish I had more now because I think I feel another attack coming on.  I visit the toilet often because my chest congestion makes me gag.  I feel like medicating myself with anything and everything tomorrow.  Screw sideeffects!  Actually, I might visit Whole Foods tomorrow to find an herbal remedy.

I visited the Cavern this evening and find it to be one of my new favorite spots.  With Spune Productions organizing the music lineup, good bands are now playing and for cheap.  If only they carried the yummy Root beer like at Haileys.

I decided to start working at Starbucks this week.  It allows me to take classes in the Spring and seems like a fun place to work.  I also like that it's down the street and less than 10 minutes away.  I start training next week.

I'm really upset about Paul Granada passing away last week.  He was only 24 years old and such a nice guy.  I never would have suspected he would take his life.  I remember a few years ago when he taught me how to drive a standard.  He was the only person I knew that had the patience for me.  I regret not making it to the funeral and not keeping in touch with him.  Actually, I haven't talked to anyone from that life.  My life was different back then, and I thought it was easier not looking back.  I'm probably wrong.  I spoke with Maggie a few days ago and felt guilty for not talking to her for a few years.  She has four kids now.  Boy how time flys.  

Lately, I've had dreams and thoughts about people from the past.  It's easy to go away for awhile but hard to let go.

cough, cough, gotta go."

"event","We're supposed to watch a movie in the living room, but I'm waiting for Josh to finish his Pac Man game.  It's been over 30 minutes.

Today, we celebrated my dad's birthday in GP.  I am so stuffed and can't believe I ate so much.  I feel icky.  However, we had a nice time and hopefully Dad liked the shirt we bought him.  He liked the colors.  I think this is the first french cuff shirt that he has owned.  Josh told him that it's in fashion now.  Mom said, ""When did he ever pay attention to fashion"".  

There were people all over the street again filming a commercial a few houses down.  I asked the cop working the corner of the street about it, and she said it was for Nutrasystems.  The house owners must make enough to pay the mortgage with renting their house out for commercials.

Yesterday, I played tennis with Nick.  Well, we hit the ball back and forth.  My muscles are achy head to toe.  I could barely get up this morning.  I hope to ""play tennis"" again in the near future.  I need to work on my skillz.

In the evening, I played with Curtis and few other guys at the Cavern.  We opened for Octopus Project and Saxon Shore, both really great bands.  Saxon Shore reminded me of Mogwai and Album Leaf.  The Octopus Project made we want to dance.  I was happy that Nick, McKenzie, her brother, Keith, Ryan, and Lauren came out to see me.  I know they weren't just there to see me, but I was glad to see them.  It was also nice seeing Dylan, since I have not seen him in so long.  I do not know what's going on these days with everyone."

Today, we are driving up to Oklahoma City to celebrate Grandpa Hal's 80th birthday.  This weekend is also Josh and my one year wedding anniversary.  We will be celebrating Grandpa's birthday that day.  I'm actually waiting to be picked up and think it will be awhile because of rush hour traffic.  I hope they get here soon because there is a candy jar at my desk, and I don't think it's wise to eat any more candy bars.

I am sad because I can't fit into most of my clothes.  I really need to get back to exercising and cut back on the root beer floats.

I look forward to going to Austin next weekend and seeing Natasha.  ACL should be a blast."

yesterday, brian p. dropped by for a little while at the house and we went shopping at urban outfitters.  josh always gets upset that the women's sale is always better than the men's.  i got a skirt that i'm wearing right now.  later on in the evening, nick g. and de'mel from high school came over for dinner.  we had taco salad and lots of fun conversation.  de'mel has accomplished a lot in life since I last saw him... very interesting."

Sunday, I went to church in Canton.  At home, I watched the Style network and slept.  I am still trying to get over jetlag.  Once I feel normal, I'll give people a call to hang out.  Right now, I'm trying to get back into the swing of things.  It's much harder than I thought it would be.

Tomorrow, I help Natasha move to Austin for school.  She will be missed by many people including me.

De'Mel moved back into the area and contacted me to meet for dinner.  He can finally meet Josh.  I'm really crappy at keeping in touch with people."

We also watched the movie Shaft and watched some breakdancers.  Surprisingly, I ran into Heather H., my old roommate from college.  We will go out for Thai food sometime.  Also, I heard Jon M. is engaged and was at the DMA today too.

Wednesday around midnight, we got back from HK.  Long flights are painful.  I miss my grandma and grandpa.  I keep having dreams about her and dim sum.  I also miss being around my dad a lot.  I keep thinking about everyone getting older and then I get sad.

The trip was lots of fun.  We did so much stuff, I'm sure I will forget to say something about everything.  Let's see... we went to Macau, went to ""Long Island"", went to a canto-pop concert, saw the movie ""Seven Swords"", ate lots of food, went to Ocean Park, went to Victoria Peak, ... I have to use the wash room now, so I will stop here.

I bought a Chinese instrument called the erhu.  Plan on learning it soon."

I have lost track of what's going on outside of my little bubble.  I even found myself asking Mike if he'd gossip with me.  My belief is if someone participates in gossip often, it must mean they believe other people's lives are more interesting than their own.  Currently, that is the case because I have found much contentment in trying new recipes and watching new movies from blockbuster.com.  Today, Josh surprised me again with an unexpected guest.  Mike from Baboon came over for a drink and the house was messy.  I always get uncomfortable about people coming over when it's messy.  A few weeks ago, he surprised me with Josh from Lift to Experience and the house was a mess that time too.  I never knew there were so many Christians in the music scene.  I also never knew Todd from the Toadies dad was a Baptist preacher.  I've never been one to pick up on lyrics well.  I'm getting bored with this rambling.

I got my passport yesterday.  It's actually the same one I sent to have replaced.  They updated it by stamping some new information onto the back page of the passport.  The picture is really old and doesn't really resemble me.  I don't get to change it until 2008.  Hopefully, I'll have good skin then.  I actually have a fear of wrinkles right now.  That is why I regularly moisturize my face and try to get 8 - 10 hours of sleep a day.  Also, I try to avoid too much sun exposure.  Botox is not an option.  I think those people are loony for having toxins injected into their body.  Sick!

I think I might be obsessed with losing weight - my 5 - 8 lbs.  I compulsively hop on my digital scale several times a day anticipating the day I reach my target weight.  It's all really silly.  I actually was happy to help some friends move the other day because I knew I would exhert a lot of energy and in the meantime lose .5 - 1 lb. from it.  I'm actually pretty disappointed I can't fit into my pants from last year.  This sucks."

"event","I finished the paperwork to temp for two temp agencies.  I haven't gotten any work from it yet.  I was supposed to meet with a guy to help him with his real estate and art shows, but decided not to worry about it because he seemed a little flaky.  Also, I didn't feel good about it.

I took pictures of stuff to sell on Ebay and Craig's list, but I am having difficulty finding the cord that connects the digital camera to the computer.  Getting rid of some of the bulky items and receiving some money from it would be really nice now.

I need to figure out what to do for Father's day.  I have no clue.

Josh is a wonderful husband."

"event","Yesterday, I biked about 10 miles at White Rock Lake with Josh and Alicia.  It was fun, but it was difficult keeping up on the hybrid.  The weather was nice in the evening, but it also brought with it the bugs that kept running into my face.  I got a mosquito bite on my neck that is so itchy right now.  

Today, I cleaned the house - dusted, vacuumed, swept, mopped, and etc.  fun...

Some time in the past few years, I grew a dislike of the telephone.  Maybe it was from over using it in my younger days.  Now, I truly hate it.  I have difficulty answering it even when it's people that I like.  (This excludes Vanessa who is far away and that I don't get to see and my sisters.)  I guess I don't mind it when I know the conversation will be at most 5 minutes.  I like using the phone to quickly make plans and take care of business.  I would rather see people in person to talk.  I am supposed to call a few people to tell them about information tonight, and I am dreading it.  I don't really know why, but I get a strange fear inside.  I have become way much more introverted lately.  The past few times I've gone to parties, I've gotten a little bit of social anxiety.  People make me uncomfortable.  Now, I talk less, and listen more.  I think it's out of habit.  

It's hard to find part-time or temp work for now till June 30th and from July 6th-July 18.  

I'm sad I'm missing Jenny and Duane's wedding because I'll be out of the country.  I was really looking forward to the celebration."

I got a haircut today and am really happy with the end results.  This time around, I went to Avalon at Snider Plaza - a place I hadn't visited since my sophmore year at SMU, and I had my old cell phone.  I gave my stylist a challenge involving an asymmetrical cut he had never done before.  I'm so glad I currently don't work in the corporate world.  I enjoy experimenting with my hair.  Alicia says I look like an F.O.B.  She's so goofy.

I went to orchestra practice today and had a good time.  I made it point to practice beforehand, which made a big difference.  I'm glad Alicia and I get to spend time together playing music.  It's good for me to play in an orchestral group.  I didn't realize how much I missed it.

Troy, Alicia, Josh, and I went to Teppo today.  Their sushi is pretty good.  It was fun hanging out.  I hope we do it more often.

<b>NICK</b> - I told Alicia that you play tennis and that you're pretty good, so she now wants to play tennis with you.  I found you another tennis player.  If only they payed a finder's fee for things like that."

"event","yesterday, we celebrated memorial day at flag pole hill.  the dallas symphony orchestra gave a free performance consisting of stuff from sousa, copeland, bernstein, and etc.  you get the picture.  the city provided an amazing fireworks performance at the finale, which surpassed any other light show I have seen in the area.  it's a nice precursor to independence day.  i'll be out of town in maui.  hopefully, there will be celebrations while we are there.  

exercise: today - ran, monday - played tennis
i look forward to saturday when i get to go rollerskating or rollerblading at natasha's birthday party.  

recipes: i'm trying new recipes as usual.  vegetable beef with barley soup and coq du vin

movie: i saw the criterion collection version of fannie and alexander.  it's an interesting biography."

"event","Today, Alicia asked me why I don't update my livejournal anymore.  I decided I would try a little harder not to be so lazy with it.

Yesterday, I watched Star Wars Episode III and was disappointed with the theater because it wasn't THX.  The sound was pretty bad.  I am tempted to watch IV, V, and VI now.  Mom, I'm going to borrow yours.  :)  Natasha and Nina, I don't think she reads our livejournals.

Today, I went to try out a community orchestra with Alicia.  I knew two people in the orchestra.  One shared a stand with me a few times in Youth Orchestra (Becca) and Mr. Galvan was Natasha's orchestra teacher for a year.  He made a few comments about how good Nina plays violin.  He was a little surprised she was in second chair.  He said,""We all know Nina is the best violinist at South.""  I'll stop braggin about my sister now.  I think I will continue playing with the orchestra because they are performing some neat pieces, and it's conveniently located near downtown D.  We're working on a Berlioz piece, Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, Schubert's Ouverture zur Zauberharfe, and Bach's Ouverture in D Minor.  I played 1 or 2 of them before a long time ago.  I had to sight read today, which I hadn't done in a long time.  I enjoyed it.  I asked for 2nd violin because I'm lazy and want to start out with easier music.  I need to get back into groove or playing in an orchestra.  Well, we'll see how things go.

We made spinach manicotti for dinner.  yum.  i made beef with flat noodles for lunch.  there is room for improvement.  i still like to use Ming Tsai's cookbooks.  I haven't been let down yet.

Currently, I am reading, ""The Great Conversation"" and a book about Maui.  

<b>Natasha</b> - Tomorrow evening, we are going to the Nasher and possibly the DMA.  It was such a coincidence I ran into Michelle M. at the DMA last week.  We will be meeting Alicia and her date.  We haven't firmed up a time yet, but let me know if you, Julie, Natalie, Evita, or any of your other friends are going to attend too.  We can meet up."

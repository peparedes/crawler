Visit me at tumblr!
It is easy and fun and simple and easy, did I&nbsp;mention EASY?!

The only reason&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't post to LJ is because it takes me years to post one picture or do something stupid like that. Sooo, come follow me on tumblr if you have an account, if you don't have an account (YOU&nbsp;SHOULD&nbsp;GET&nbsp;ONE) you can see my lastest posts update on twitter (raan_crow is my username). Or there is the rss feed.... I'm not really sure how that works.

I'll definitely still be on lj because of my lovely friends. But I&nbsp;just will post very very rarely (haha very unusual).

(anyway, I totally recommend you all get a tumblr, it takes seriously 2 seconds to sign up with email, password, and username and you are in! and you can post regular text, pictures, music, videos, chat convos, etc. the only downside is that there is no comment area for posts, you have to add it using another website which isn't hard either. SO&nbsp;GO&nbsp;CREATE&nbsp;A&nbsp;TUMBLR&nbsp;83 )

"event","I've been on a roll~~ Just in the past three days I&nbsp;decided to make a story that I&nbsp;could easily turn into a comic. So that means, not a super long, plot intensive one, just with my seven-ish main characters and their day to day adventures/stories/troubles!

Soon after, they move into the same apartment and TONS of awesome stuff, and not so awesome stuff happens. But the punk Nana has a band and I LOVE their songs!! :3 <br /><br />*points to icon/avatar* Thats Shin &lt;3 He is awesome x)<br /><br />---<br /><br />Ugh. School pretty much stinks.

"event","o1. Eeeh. I suck at writing journals. *dies* I mean, IRL I've tried so many times to keep up a diary, or journal. It always fails. I guess I thought making an online journal would work. It IS easier, I am just too lazy *dies* The only journals I've been able to continue have been my art notebook things &lt;33 <br /><br />o2. ECLIPSE *dies* <b>NO SPOILERS HERE</b> but... Ohmigosh that book was LOVE! If you haven't read the <u>Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer</u> yet, YOU MUST! Its like obligatory for everyone... well maybe not boys &gt;.&gt; Unless you want to become gay from loving Edward too much o.o There isn't anything wrong with that! xD&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not going to say anything about Eclipse here because some people haven't been able to read it yet. But if you want to talk about it you can email me (wolfie1818@yahoo.com) or comment and be sure to put a SPOILER warning!<br /><br />o3. <b>Zombie- Loan</b>. An awesome anime strawberrychan got me into. It only has 6 subbed episodes out but you should totally watch it! I can't wait for the next episode!! Anyway, its about this one girl you can see rings around people's necks that no one else can see. And they pretty much mean that person is going to die. Two boys at her school have them but haven't died yet, and soon she finds out they are zombies and they have to pay of a 'zombie-loan' to become human again by killing off other zombies :D SHITO/CHIKA = &lt;3 And totally my OTP x)<br /><br />o4. FLCL! Another anime, this one is the most <i>random</i> anime I have ever watched... its crazy. I love it xD It only has SIX episodes in the entire series. The whole show is like a metaphor to growing up and stuff you encounter... haha its awesome. And the ending song is the <u><b>best</b></u>.... ever. But try it out!<br /><br />o5. SCHOOL *dies* It starts up on the 20th. I am SOOO not ready, and Junior year is supposed to be the hardest. My procrastination skill won't help either xD<br /><br />ANYWAY. I'll have to post some recent pictures I've drawn and I need to update more often *diesagain*<br /><br />&lt;3 Emelia"

Eww, and I saw a centipede in my bathroom today *dies* My dad killed it thankfully. xD Man... I dunno what it is about me but I somehow seem to be 'attracting' bugs! Even though I freakin despise them!

Oh and has anyone read His Dark Materials series? I reading the second book now, The Subtle Knife. They are really good books :D
I also recently finished the Abhorsen series, my favorite book was Lireal. She has an awesome Dog &lt;33 x)

"event","EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWW!!!! *spaz*<br /><br />You are probably wondering what the heck I'm talking about... lets start from the begining.<br /><br />I get home today from my Youth Orchestra and I walk over to the front stairs, my house has two staircases and I usually put my shoes in the front after coming throught the garage. So as I get close (like 6 ft) I see this GIGANTIC FREAKING BUG crawling all around the tile floor by the stairs and I spaz out and run around the living room until my dad goes to see and soon squish the bug. I watch from the landing above the stairs afters going up the back staircase. So my dad gets a paper towel and squishes the bug and is like, ""What the--?!"" And out pop HUNDREDS of little baby spiders!! My dad gets the windex and sprays the floor all over and wipes up the babies. I hope he got them all because as you can tell I have a DEATHLY fear of arachnids. *dies*<br /><b><br />Lesson for today...</b><br /><br />- Watch out when you see a humongous spider, because when you squish it&nbsp; might just be in the process of giving birth to hundreds, no THOUSANDS of little baby spiders.<br /><br />&lt;3 Emelia"

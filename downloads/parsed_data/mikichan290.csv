i can still feel the eye doctor poking around at my eye lol
- air test
- light test
- reading capabilities
- better, or worse?
- him putting the contacts on FOR ME.. a bit odd having someone up in ur face and putting stuff in your own eye..

Anyways.. next appointments in march i think.. thats when they teach me how to put the lenses on and how to take 'em out.. it will be interesting..
in the meantime i dont get the lenses till then and im still wearing glasses. Speaking of, im going back in about a week or two for replacements or something cuz the color peeled and they were pretty expensive to do that and its been less than a year.. so yea i basically get warrenty and replacement. The only downside is that they aren't the same color.. they're silver.. hmm.. i'll see how thats gonna turn out =] 

P.S.- lunch was fun sakura.. although i still feel like im gonna burst at the sides lol.. SO MUCH FOOD!! too bad we couldn't grab tea, owell.. i hope the weekend will give us the time to ""frolick"" haha =p

P.S.S: lol..  i've been using the = smilies  lately? but not the wicked old =) with parenthesis.. i don't think i'll resolve back to those days.. 1999.. wow.. doesn't seem that long ago, but its been 7 years! anyways back to my smilies lol.. =] with brackets lol yea.. and of course these ^-^"

hmmm... what should i write about first?! 
1) woah i actually made honor roll!
2) I JUST FOUND OUT IM GETTING DISSMISSED TOMORROW! at 1 or something for an eye appointment.. contacts! its sad i havent missed a day of skool yet or even gotten dismissed.. 
3) today was international club, sayaka, liya and angel presented about japan and china... they did awesome =p me and momo were afraid to walk in at first because of all the random ppl (which btw were never there the previous meetings.. i think they just came for free food.. grrness on those ppl) <-- i have no idea what i just wrote. o yea and some mean old lady yelled at me cuz i put 2, TWO pieces of candy in my pocket!? meanwhile the girl b4 took a handful ( her exact words being ""aw i love this stuff!"".. the lady was all like ""thats enough, you just shoved a whole bunch in your pocket"" i was all like ""but i only took two pieces!!"" .. dumb ppl *mumble.. mumble..* O and how could i forget, sayaka said ""yea, it sucks"" while presenting to the club, infront of like 4 teachers ahh, i love her hahah
4) SRY sakura... she asked me if i wanted to come out for lucnch w/ her today with sat i think.. maybe next time.. i couldn't cuz of international club (T-T WE NEED TO HANG OUT MORE!! .. *cafe hopping!!* mwuahahah.. 
5) no that im typing with my fingers, lol, i remembered.. I SLICED MY FINGER in art with the linoleum (dno how to spell) cutter.. i hate linoleum prints.. i had to do one last year.. i dont think im too good at it.. o well i'll try to make it come out as best as possible, plus, i think tomorrow i might be done cutting it, then i move on to prints!! 

6) Isn't it ironic i still have to do laundry on my day off?

7) i think i finally figured out how to insert a pic!! lets see if i can... (probably not haha, just getting my hopes up):

"event","Soo... today was the Puffy AmiYumi concert in Davis sq. It was planned to start at 7:00 pm, so me, sakura, & momo went around 6:00.  When we got there we went to the stand where they were selling merch (tshirts, tourbooks, wristbands, cds, fans, etc...) I bought a fan and a wristband... Okay.. next, we went to our seats, unfortunately they were not the best... (stuck in the balcony in the back right =.=) Anyways.. at 7:00pm some random opening act came out.. never heard of them nor want to hear anymore of them-- lets just say they were-- eehh-- no comment. they werent even japanese u.u ... they finally finished after like a 1/2 hour, then it took another 1/2 hour to set things up and move the other bands stuff outta the way. The most random ppl showed up for it =.= urr i dont even wanna try explaining them butthe majority were random kids with 'otaku' shirts on... ANYWAYS... around 8:00, Ami and Yumi finally came out ^o^.. i wanted their outfit sooo bad... they played a few songs, which btw where hard to see due to the bad seats and the large ppl obstructing the view >.< ... When they went to talk, they had everything written out on flash cards.. it was pretty funny.. they eventually gave up on the english and started speaking in japanese, asking all the japanese members in the audiance to translate for them... due to my poor japanese skills, i only picked up like 2 words of what they were saying >.< *hits self for not studying harder*... they went on for most of the concert, i wanted to take pictures soo bad but the ppl that worked at the theatre wouldnt get away from us, and since you werent supposed to take any pictures, i only left w/ 3, one of them hopefully including ami and yumi. Their next break was funny, they started to say how they found out about how things like clam chowder and dunkin donuts were native to boston, so they asked the crowd if there were any other places... so, which i have no idea why (stupid ppl >.=) tons of ppl in the audiance yell ""crispy cream' and ""starbucks""... after that discussion, they began speaking in japanese which would be interupped by a ""by the way..."" ...""have you visited puffyamiyumi.com"" and ""have you seen the hi hi puffy amiyumi show?"", which was also funny cuz they said they had never really seen it because they play the show in the US, south america,Europe, and some of asia... but NOT in JAPAN!! xD 
After, they went on with the show for a few more songs, ending it with either teen titans or their theme song.. i forget... but after a couple minutes break, the croud started to stomp their feet and all yell ""PUFFY!!"" Sooo... they came back on the stage for their encore... in which they told the crowd how they recently got to meet green day and how they were fans of them. they asked the crowd if they liked green day as most of the crowd goes ""yea"" me and my freinds were like ""uhh.. NO.. eww"" >.<  and then they played a green day cover song (i forget which song) and finally ended the show with one last song and a bow with their band ^-^
Overall, it was a pretty good show and im glad i got to see them, (especially since they announced it was their last show in boston)although i wish it was Dir en grey or something, but puffy's cool too, ne?"

But today was the day i got my necklace from ebay ^o^.. i just opened it since i had to wait till sakura got out of work and i ordered it off of her uncles paypal..it shipped all the way from singapore.. Its a pretty cool necklace it is a ""replica"" of toshiyas, anybody who knows/ likes toshiya would know the necklace im talking about since he always wears it. It also came w/ a keychain thing (arent i good at explaining things??) its like a card w/ toshiyas pic on it ^-^. The necklace has like a silver chain, but the links are like balls, and the pendant part is a white oval with a little bit of silver around it. The necklace i got was pretty similar i guess, im happy w/ my first ebay purchase ^-^... id put an example pic but i dno how to put pics in entrys.. yet. 

O ya the other day i put up an icon.. i hope it looks okay.. (but of course it does since its toshiya)ill probably b changing it alot since i  have so many pics.. hard decision to choose just 1... although i feel like my icon is missing stuff...  other ppl have like flashy words or changing pics.. o well ill keep mine simple since i have no idea how to do that (unless i steal it from someone/ some site) haha... .. ."

It was so weird cuz we never expected them to be like all into jrock/ jpop... it was awesome cuz i got a dir en grey single ^o^. the lady that worked there was like ""the owners in Japan right now getting cds and stuff"" and we were all like ""we are coming back to get those cds""... i still cant believe she didnt know miyavi was in a movie .. i even knew that.. lol... then after some randomness we went to tokyo kid where sakura got so mad.. bwahaha.. the guy that works there was like ""ya we got a miyavi dvd the other day (which she had on hold, but they forgot or something) and some girl walked in as i was putting on the shelf and bought it"" not only that.. heheh .. he thought Miyavi was a woman XD.. it made sakura soooooo maddd.

"event","Okay, so. School is over, exams suck. Enough on that. The title pretty much summarizes this entry.

My parents were out of town for the past week pretty much, first in Boston and then visiting my brother for his convocation in San Diego. (He has his Masters!! Wow!)

So this meant unlimited awesomeness, which basically equated to every second I wasn't studying, hanging out, watching movies, eating ridiculous amounts of microwaved popcorn, making delicious dinners and occasionally getting lazy and going to the grand opening of the Callingwood 'newly renovated' Safeway and making a meal out of sampling all the free food. With Karene and Christie. Sleepovers. Then Christie left, and Karene stayed. Then Karene left and Christie stayed. She's been to her house once since Thursday. I love it.

So last night after my bio exam, we made a great dinner and (of course) microwaved popcorn. Then we went to my basement and set up her gamecube and played video games for an hour. Then I wanted to keep playing, and she went upstairs and made cookies. I joined her shortly. And we ate. And watched the thunderstorm and went for a walk. And then played more gamecube.

Seriously, who needs a boyfriend when your best friend is pretty much everything you need? (including the masculine elements like videogame savvyness and the like? She actually took a gender identity test, which said she was 85% masculine. ""Are you kidding? I would drive around until my death before pulling over for directions."")

So basically, (I just realized I've already started 2 othe paragraphs with 'so'. Le sigh.) I am going to miss her more than my family when I go to live in the Czech next year. Which will be amazing and excellent and inspirational and a great experience and all that, but still. Must make the most of time now.

Jules' grad is Thursday. >.< At the time it seemed an okay idea to  be his date, but he is making a bit too big of a deal about it which is making me a bit worried. I just want to go, stay, dance a bit, and go home. That's not going to happen. I also want him to have as good a time as I had at my grad, and I know it will be my fault if I wreck it for him because of my lack of enthusiasm. I'll do my best to make it a good time. 

My birthday is Friday. Hm. Interesting. I am completely unsuspecting of any plans my friends might have. Really. I am not at all interested in the facebook event 'Loie's Surprise Birthday'. Uh-huh."

"event","So it was fun. One of those things that is really hyped up but you know it is so you don't make too high of expectations, and when it's over it doesn't seem like that big of a deal. But I'm a graduate now, so I guess that is cool.

Devon came as my date, and my parents took pictures (that didn't turn out that well unfortunately) and we went to pick up Christie and took more pictures there. Then we drove to the Shaw, waited 30 minutes to turn right to go into the parking lot, got frustrated and afraid that I would miss the procession, but didn't have to be as when I got there I was forced to ditch said date and best friend and go wait in the procession line doing nothing for 40 minutes. 

The dinner was okay, they catered to allergies (which at our table were plentiful), the dancing was quite fun (especially the slow dances, which take no skill whatsoever and involve not very much of anything except being close to a (in my case) very attractive boy). So that was cool. He had to leave at 11:15 about, so Christie and I drove off to Adam's for the afterparty and got there at about 12:30. It was low key, with only about 8 of us (Adam, his girlfriend Kat, Christie, Emily, Diamond, Sarah, Mary and I) and there was much good food. Adam lit the fire pit and we sat around and jumped on the trampoline and went inside and had champagne (in me, Emily and Christie's case, non-alcoholic champagne, which was totally cleaned out before the real champagne hehe). Eventually around 3 I was too tired, so I drove Christie and I home. 

In the morning (approximately 5 hours later) I forced myself out of bed to go prepare for my students' piano recital which went extremely well. I am feeling very sad lately, I think this is a result of a few things... namely that Steve left today and Zohreh leaves on Wednesday, and that she is extremely and chronically ill... and also that I don't know what to do with myself now that grad isover. I never thought past it. Also I am a bit disappointed in myself, but that's a bit of a different story.

Overall, a good weekend."

My sister and her husband are coming to my grad, which is really awesome, except that apparently my sister in law really wanted to come but I don't have enough tickets. 

I want to stop being stressed out. Not likely to happen until IB exams are over (which I haven't started studying for and start on Thursday)... and until I get my hands on the new Mika CD, which banishes any sad feelings within 30 seconds. 

I need to find a time to see Devon before my grad. And Jules before his... why I am not sure, but he's insistent.

Practicing piano has pretty much disappeared from my life. No time, no energy.

Nothing is finalized for next year, which is also freaking me out. I'm applying for the university in any case... we'll see what happens.

I think I'll end the complaints here."

I had an awesome day at school on Friday. It was mainly great because I got something that has been stressing me out off my shoulders, and it resulted in getting to know someone better. We had a good conversation for about 2 hours. Who does homework at school or goes to class? Not us!

So... then I got sick. Anyway. That singer Mika, who sings 'Love Today' and 'Lollipops' writes really really catchy songs... in falsetto. It's pretty sweet. 

I started writing again, and I realized how much I missed it. I wrote it on Thursday, which wasn't a good day, so I wrote a poem about that day and the day before, and then when the next day was over, I added that day in. I don't know. I have a lot of writing about the people in my life. I never name them, and by the end they probably wouldn't even recognize themselves. I once wrote this poem about a problem I was having with a friend and posted it on my blog and she messaged me a few days later saying she really liked it and wanted to forward it to all her friends. Life works in strange ways.

I love this song... What a Good Boy by the Barenaked Ladies... the lyrics say a lot to me:

I wake up scared 
I wake up strange 
I wake up wondering if anything in my life 
Is ever gonna change 
I wake up scared 
I wake up strange 
And everything around me stays the same"

"event","...and have been since yesterday. Not really sure why. I think it's because like I suspected would happen, since my last entry things have gone somewhat downhill. I painted my nails bright pink and the fumes are getting to my head so maybe I can cheer up before the night is over...

Basically I'm annoyed at school. And 2 people that don't merit my annoyance. But anyway.

Friday was a bad, bad day, which got better on the bus ride home- some people know what I'm talking about. Got dressed and pretty and Alyssa came to pick up Diamond, Emily and I for the dinner and dance... which was fun. My brother and his wife came, which was cool but they left early because the music was too 'slow' for them. I tried to flag down a few token males for Amy to dance with since she's too shy to ask, but they were all busy playing in the band, like almost all our guy friends, which was irritating and left us to be preyed on by the two creepy 25 year old drunk guys. 

Went home, slept, was awoken early, on the road to Fort Mac to go see my aunt in Little Shop of Horrors. Was very very awesome, met aunt's biology teacher ex boyfriend who was very cool and very cute. (am I allowed to say that? he was all excited because he got a 'chili pepper' rating on ratemyprofessors.ca which means students think he's hot.) Had pie, lasagna, fun stuff. Car ride= not so awesome, especially on the trip back in which my parents felt the need to criticize my driving every 2 minutes for the remaining 2.5 hours to Edmonton. Came home, bad mood. 

Tried to study math. Hence, bad mood continues. 

Don't want to study anymore. Maybe I'll take a bath."

"event","This is usually the time of year when I go ""holy crap, it's already February??"" when really... there's still 4 1/2 months left of school... which I guess in retrospect isn't that much considering it's my last year here. Which again reminds me of the fact that I don't know what to do next year, where to go, how to get there and where the money's coming from.

Also I'm at this point where even though I'm procrastinating and stressed out and barely have a minute during the week to stop and drink tea and read the paper (but I do anyway because it's important to my sanity), I'm still feeling pretty good. I'm in this state where I'm not really dissatisfied with any relationships. In fact the relationships that have gone downhill don't bother me because I have better ones with other people, and best of all, I'm flattered a lot lately because of attention and possibility, and nice stuff. It's kind of selfish but it's good to feel valued and liked by some people, and it's even better when it feels like there's no possibility of getting hurt. That's why this year is better than the last I'm sure.

Anyway, shower, conics, English IB oral prep, party, home, Desperate Housewives.


Oh, and a postcard secret from this Sunday that made me smile:

On a weird note, I'm all liking artists I haven't listened to in ages, like Justin Timberlake (which I've written about) and Boy George and Bryan Adams and don't even get me started on my George Michael obsession... I'm always getting made fun of for that.

Meanwhile... my history paper is driving me crazy... I can't seem to make my question specific enough and I can't write my investigation or do my research until I narrow down my question. Same with my lit investigation.

This has been a difficult past couple days as the most popular teacher at my school has been charged with sex crimes related to a student and the whole school is really upset...

Okay, so here are some pros of today in order to cheer me up:

-Aaron fixed my internet! Woohoo!
-Aaron's here!
-Only 5 more days of school!
-I have a ton of really useful books for my investigation!
-I got a cool new wallet, scarf, and perfume!
-My Opa and Grandma Gerry gave me 100$ for christmas!

"event","So, update time.

I am getting used to the workload of this year, and am finding that I don't only have to keep on top of things- I have to anticipate almost everything because combined with all my other activities I'm left with only Sunday as my committment-free day. Things seem to be going well, although my marks aren't as high as they should be, but it's okay because I'm getting used to all my new teachers. I think I only have 1 teacher that I've had in the past.

ARGH my entry just deleted up to there, so just a quick summary before I go make supper.

-I've started piano lessons again which is great although I don't have enough time or energy as I'd like despite my improved time management skills. I'm starting tomorrow accompanying (sp?) a children's choir which gives me money, yay!

-I'm practicing trombone at least twice a week which is an improvement from last year where I practiced about twice a year- once for the Christmas concert, one for the end of the year.

-I'm doing pilates almost every day at 6:30 AM.

-I get to see AARON, ZOHREH AND STEVEN TOMORROW!!! Yay.

-I'm sooo sick of the people I have to be around at school, not all of them, but many of them. 

And I must go make dinner. Ciao!"

"event","My tummy hurts... I don't know why.

School is hard and a lot of work. I'm trying to get stuff done in advance and in general that's working, except that I get stressed out earlier- which I suppose is better than later. Damn... I just checked and I only got 72% on my social test... and I studied really hard for it... grr... I thought it was really easy when everyone else found it hard so I knew this would happen. Oh well, I'll get over it. It's only one test. 

I have too much stuff going on... either that or poor time management skills... probably both... I feel really pressured by my mom to be doing everything at once and it's starting to mess with me. It's also kind of weird living with someone else in the house that's not my sibling... it's fun but it's also an adjustment.

I'm worried about getting into university. Bah. School is stressful.

"event","So I was going through my grade 11 agenda which was where  I wrote down memorable quotes, and these are some of the funniest things that were recorded:

Student: Wouldn't you add it?
Math teacher: Well, I'm screwing it- um. Squaring it.

""Today, April 26, is the day my social teacher told me she was on opium.""

""You think the Bible is boring, but it's full of smut."" -Religion teacher

Student: You have like, eight.
Religion teacher: *twitch* I know. They're gone.
Student: Where?
Religion teacher: *twitch* *twitch* *twitch* NEVER YOU MIND.

The marks are still there,

"event","HMM, so I'm pretty happy about a few things, but first, something is in order:

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO <lj user=""lekk"">!!! Your birthday is tomorrow, but it's unlikely I'll be able to update tomorrow, so yay, sorry I can't attend. :(

So, the reasons I'm happy are as follows:

-I did pilates today for like, the first time in 3 weeks. Go me. But that's not really a huge reason, I'm just starting to realize how much exercise makes my mood improve. Maybe I should start getting up super early and doing it before school every morning. Yeah right, like that's going to happen.

-I officially have 5 piano students this year. This is a major improvement from last year, where I had one regular one. She was extremely difficult, and I felt like she should either quit or pay me double. Oh well. This also means $$$, more work, but I'm really enjoying preparing for it, and learning a lot in the process. (I'm gonna be so prepared for job interviews in the future, teehee)

-My schedule for next year is what I want it to be... I'm also adapting a better attitude about classes and people I don't like, and finding new meaning and significance in the phrase, ""hate the sin, not the sinner"".

-I went to the Fringe with Jen a few days ago, and ran into my stalker of 2 years ago!! You wouldn't think this would make me happy, but... it's a long story. *blush*

-Closure. Finally.

I think that's it. Ciao!!"

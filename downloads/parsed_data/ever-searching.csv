Some people have naturally weak immunities and inclinations to different illnesses/diseases.

No one knows what is wrong yet - and frankly its no one's (ESP. you) business... but I have to say, in honor of the beauty of his soul:

SOMETIMES people almost die from liver failure and the like and it has nothing to do with alcohol or outside substances or anything of the like.


He may be small but he's has to overcome physical and mental challenges that the likes of many people could not survive.


And he has...

So yes, I'm sorry but some may display a public hatred and desire to rid themselves of things/people/situations (which aren't even *truly* there in the first place - not in the scheme of things outside one's head actually)... 


But when I get multiple emails from someone blaming me for an illness of someone they don't know while said person is calling me a hateful meddling hidden-agenda type person...


You have to wonder how much heart that person actually has.



I would never blame something that could possible kill someone on another person - unless of course it came from your hand.


Insensitive fucks.



Maybe some should blame themselves then whenever someone you like to control falls ill.  THAT is more likely... but I'd never dare email anyoe over and over and say crazy wacked out evil shit claiming that an illness or a death is any person's fault.


So yes, I end with a big FUCK YOU and your ASSumptions... and I pity those that would dare say you have a heart... 


A heart would never strike a woman by blaming her for the health issues of another which has been flooding her mind and her heart and her essence since it was told to her.


No one has any clue of anything.


I am ever_searching... and at times I'm foolish and naive... and blind.

But no one could look here and understand me - anything that's been released here is for me to use as a tool of better understanding in my ever searching journey of self and life... and my ever searching of the humanity of all people and better acceptance of things that I cannot easily understand (for I do not assume to know all... nor will I ever - esp. when it comes to other people).


Your judgments no longer sting.  But I do damn you for your words on a loved one, his illness, and my weakness in that area.

"event","Thank you to those of you who have kept my older co-worker in your thoughts in prayers.

I am happy to just receive and share the news that Howard Turner has just come out of surgery and is doing well.

He had the cancerous kidney removed (which also included the removal of a rib) and his spleen.  They looked again at the spot on the liver but said they are not worried about it (I'm sure they didn't say *that* but this is from Mr. Howard's wife)...

He is stable and doing well.  We are all very relieved.  Glenda (my work mom) will be up in his area for her son's soccer tournament this weekend and wil get to visit him.

Which is good because she is a lot like my real mom - very emotional and in touch with loved ones.

<lj-cut text=""Well.. onto my reason for my subject title...."">

We heard about Howard 10-15 minutes ago... but I look up (Glenda sits where I can see her) and she's in major tears.  Being that we are friends too, I get up and go hug her from behind her seat... worried that she just got some bad news about Howard or something.

But they are happy tears caused by a gift given from another lady here that some people misjudge as a ""hard ass"".  Bare in mind that this ""hard ass"" has tons of animals from fish and geckos to gods (she loves the reptiles though)... Her and I had an immediate connection when I brought pictures of my children here.  We swap stories and photos and I have gotten to see a side of her that some others do not see.

So when she gets in her ""moods"", me and some others really do know that its just that.

Anyway, Lynn (which is her name) often wears this really pretty Mignon Faget (a pricey jeweler in New Orleans) necklace to work and Glenda often teases her about stealing it and stuff because she loves it.

Lynn is blunt - the kind of person who may offend you if you don't know how to realize that she is playing.  She always says ""you need to get that husband of yours to go out and get you one since you like it so much"".  I guess she knew that Glenda would either never ask or that her husbnad just wouldn't.


Well, holding Glenda - I see an email on her screen...  Lynn apparently won at the casino recently... and decided to use her extra winnings for her friend... She bought a present for a friend and told Glenda to look in her drawer.

And there it was... a necklace just like the one Glenda loves.


</lj-cut>


And it could've been anything.  But wow... My day has been the good day I set out to have from witnessing first hand the ultimate gift -

I am just me... and I try to understand that person to the best of my abilities for me... not for you or you or you or you.

Just like I write in here for me - not for you... though I often welcome your thoughts, feelings, or whatever what I may be pondering may bring up for you... because I enjoy seeing the parts that make the whole of real people.


I don't believe I ever claim to be anything.  I don't *try* to be anything.

I am not ashamed of my shortcomings and I am not overly impressed with what I may have as personal strengths - they are strengths for me and no one else - though it is wonderful should those strength positively affect another person.


Maybe I am wrong here.  But I don't try to dress any certain way (I basically wear the same thing ever week) or even fix my hair (ponytails galore!) or try to be anything that anyone wants me to be.

If I'm hungry, I eat... I enjoy life as its presented to me as much as I can.


I explore life and myself and those around me.


Maybe I'm wrong... but fake... Fake to me is the kind of person that has to repeatedly tell you who they are in simple terms ""honest"" ""easy going"" ""fun"" etc etc... why?

Who knows... my thought is that in repeating, they are hoping to convince themselves.

Your love, liftin' me higher

So keep it up, quench my desire

Keeps on liftin' (your love keeps liftin' me)

Keeps on (liftin' me, liftin' me)
Liftin' me (liftin' me) higher and higher (higher)

Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and he soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again

That's why your love (your love keeps liftin' me)
Keeps on liftin' (your love keeps liftin' me)
Higher (liftin' me, liftin' me), higher, and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps liftin' me)
Keeps on (liftin' me, liftin' me)
Liftin' me (liftin' me) higher and higher (higher)
Awww

I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes, that one in a million girls
And I wish my lovin' arms around ya
Honey, I can stand up and face the world

Let me tell ya your love (your love keeps liftin' me)
Keeps on liftin' (your love keeps liftin' me)
Higher (liftin' me, liftin' me), higher, and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps liftin' me)
Keeps on (liftin' me, liftin' me)
Liftin' me (liftin' me) higher and higher (higher)

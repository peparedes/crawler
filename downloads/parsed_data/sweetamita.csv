Again if I say the word FREE its all self explanitory from there..I left class early..I think there might have been 10 out of the 35 people in class that day..hmm I wonder where they all went...Dave Matthews is HOT even though he is balding..I had a lil hiatus from Dave for a bit but going to the concert was definately a refresher..Dave will remain classic and I stay true to his older joints so I was happy he played #41..In a nutshell the concert was very chill and entertaining, I felt a little old being that I saw a few 10 and 12 year olds toking a bowl and that most of the population were white upperclass abercrombie highschoolers..It was like Shenendehowa x100! Yickes! It was dope though. Dave Matthews, I scream for you, and that means a lot.
~Hey, my friend
It seems your eyes are troubled
Care to share your time with me
Would you say you're feeling low and so
A good idea would be to get it off of your mind
See, you and me
Have a better time than most can dream
Have it better than the best
And so can pull on through
Whatever tears at us
Whatever holds us down
And if nothing can be done
We'll make the Best of What's Around
Turns out not where but who you're with
That really matters
And hurts not much when you're around~"

"event","So now I decide to update my journal... Sam lets me know that he put me on his list of ""friends"" but I never write anything sorry man, well, here goes my spurts of exposing my daily life online..
Yesterday was pretty dope I must say, everything fell into place pretty nicely, and I thank god for it.  I had so much fun.  I attended Limited Too's Passion for Fashion Show, very cute.  Since I have been working within the children's clothing circuit,  I found out about this free O-Town Concert Limited Too was sponsoring in the City.  There was no specified time to when the concert was going to start they just said that the fashion show would be going on from 12-2pm and the concert would follow afterwards.  I told most of my friends about it, but of course I got the ""O-Town?? Who's that?"" or ""I dunno about O-Town..""  So you say it's gay, whatever.  They're the hottest boy band I've seen.  Plus it was free. The best things in life are for free.  My plan was to get up real early to beat the teeny bopper crowd, but I didn't end up getting up till 11.  I commend my Edawg for tagging along with me even though he got the ""you're a fag,"" for going from the rest of the guys.  
So it's pouring out, no better day to stay inside and watch a concert.  We drive there thinking were so late and I was about to chop Edawgs head off cuz I was getting so antsy that we weren't finding parking.  We actually find parking pretty close, but only by the 2 hour parking with the meter.  I suggested Sam's notorious idea of wrapping a quarter in tissue and shoving it into the meter, but, nah, I got some change.   So we get to the Roseland Ballroom and the security staff asks, ""you here for the show?"" and we nod our heads and walk right in.  One jerky prick of a security guard asked if we had our passes but there was one nicer guy who just let us in and gave us wristbands.  That was really cool.  So we get inside and the show didnt start yet, were surrounded by madd little girls and their parents.  They were giving out free stuff from Limited Too like pillows and gift certificates, I almost caught one but some little girl really trampled over me to get it, so I let her have it.  Everyone had to stand and watch, but we still were pretty close to the stage so I was happy.  O-Town came on not long after and boy, they were cute as hell.  I have to say they are one of the more talented boy groups out there, since Ashley can play the piano and guitar as does Jacob.  I like that.  On their first song, most of them did their runs of coming to the edge of the stage and touching peoples hands. Ashley is the one with the blond hair, he came close and was singing towards us then walked away real quick, I was just in awe of his presence.  As he was walking to the other side of the stage, Edawg says in my ear, ""yo that dude with the blond hair was checking you out!"" I laughed and said, yah right.  He says to me next time he comes close, wave to him.  So every time one of them came near to me, I'd be jumping up and down, yep i'm corny, but again, they're hot and can play instruments and sing and dance.  Overall the performance was pretty tight, I love O-Town.  That concert made my summer."

"event","What's popping all my beautiful niggas and biatches! Exuse my ghettoness, but just keeping it real and representing where I'm now from...Today is a good day I am taking the time to thank the good, sweet and gentle God(Meet the Parents-- day, by day,by day--poem! poem!) for I am officially done with my Fashion Merchadising Degree and movin on to new and better things! YEs i got my grades and i passed the stats class that i was sweating all semester. YAY! So now I am moving to Jersey City, goodbye Manhattan--for now, for now..and commuting to the city for school and work at Versace.  I am enjoying work there so far and hopefully that will lead me to even bigger smorgasboard!-- of opportunities to come.  
I want to say Congrats again to Kuya David Rebanal, the graduate of Hunter College with his Masters in Public Health--what an accomplishment! (And your baby is the bomb) The Hunter graduation yesterday was one of the quickest I've ever attended, if you looked away for a second you might have missed him walk! I had fun with my best friend Rae last nite, its never ceases to amaze me how we never see eachother, but when we do, seems like we never miss a beat.  We still had fun watching our fave movies together(Center Stage! ""I thought there was enough music for a triple... She heard you! You don't have to talk to her like that!!"")
I have to admit though. transition from finishing up school, moving out of dorm life and into the real world sucks, cuz I miss my old FIT homeys a lot. But I guess times change and places change and people change...
Day, by day, by day by day..."

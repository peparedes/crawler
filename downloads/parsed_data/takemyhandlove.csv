Life is both beautiful and horrific and equally at the same time I propose. I don't know if I can do it. But yet 21 years in the making and God is still giving me air to breath so maybe its not time to quit just yet. Do you ever feel like you can't do it? Don't worry I'm not looking for a way out but sometimes I say I'll just throw this fragile heart of mine away and walk around aimlessly without caring. So its not hard.

Thats a cop out. I dont want to be a cop out. In the grand scheme of things, I dont want to be that girl who quit.


(Ps. I miss a million people and I dont know what happened and why, but can we just forget or something and love eachother again. I want you in my life and I want to have the privelage of calling you my friend..and I'm sorry if it was something that I did - most likely. Please take me back. Oh and if you're questioning if this is about you than it is :) and you should call me and forgive me or something: 347-556-2214.)"

But alas - apparently the beach isn't big enough because it always seems that someone has to be all up in your grill. Oh well. My face got sunburned. :) I love it! The ride home with the windows down and the cooler air and the sun was...romantic. I love Pensacola only for this!

As if there was something so much greater I'm supposed to be doing with the minutes in my day...as if there is this thing that I'm supposed to be apart of and every moment I'm not is a waste.I'm sure it's love. I'm sure it's love! I'm SURE IT'S LOVE! Loving every single human being I come in contact with 3 billion times more than I do right now. I'm sure it's being like Jesus.

I think the depth of the pain we feel should be an indicator of the bare minimum of the depth of the love we should give...so that way the pain doesn't overcome us but instead make us that much more effective and beautiful and kind and graceful and strong.



ALL the LOVE we could ever want is found in the face of God. I know that in my head and I hope my heart can find that to be real and enough again. I hope that get's me through.

AND I MISS MY DREAMS
and i miss my joy or the ability to be happy about living! and waking up in the morning! 
and i miss my family. 
and i like my job. 
and i hate being alone at night when work is over because&nbsp; 
the loneliness could be compared to dieing. (no stretch of truth)

"event","&nbsp;I have a few moments here at my house before I must go again, and so I thought I'd write.<br /><br />Not a bad day for a Tuesday (thus far). I learned something neat on Sunday....The average life time is 70 years and if you&nbsp;convert that into days, than that would mean roughly 27,000 days we're given here. NOW...if you're one of those people that ""live"" just for the weekend...(like you're just surviving the week so that you can really embrace your life on&nbsp;Saturday and Sunday) &nbsp;than you really only live 7,000 of those 27, 000 days! IS THAT NOT THE MOST SOBERING THING TO HEAR? I think we're ALL guilty of just hoping Monday - Friday will breeze on by quickly so we can have the weekends to do the things we really want to.&nbsp; I don't want to be guilty any more though. Because <strong>living like that is really wasting my life</strong>.God has a significant purpose for me to wake each morning. I really do believe that.&nbsp; I want to find Him more everyday.<br /><br /><br />I'm curious as to where next year will find me. It's amazing how much changes in just a few months right?<br /><br />I think there's no telling.<br /><br />-nadia<br /><br /><br /><br />[ Jesus, I want to change. Not for me or anyone else. But because I know that you deserve so much more from my life.&nbsp; I wish you would just come pay us each a face to face visit once in while. How neat would it be to sit on the swings with you and talk and look at the stars you created and just be amazed. And see who could jump the farthest or swing the highest? I know you could because you are God but maybe you would let me win sometimes.&nbsp; I don't think it's silly to&nbsp; picture us together on a swing because YOU are THAT personal and intimate with us...<br /><br />Oh how&nbsp; your Love is the most brilliantly radiant light we could ever see!!!! ]"

"event","<p>&nbsp;Well... <br /><br />Honestly, I don't know where to begin. My body is STILL sore from playing an intense game of soccer the other night after church. Could soccer be my long -lost love, you ask? It just might. It's super fun and you don't realize how much exercise you are getting because you are focused on just getting that ball. I can definitley say I appreciate the sport. Maybe some folks will being playing on Monday nights again, and if so, you can bet on seeing me there.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a more serious note&nbsp; = can I just that I don't believe there are words (in ANY present language) that could be used to adequately&nbsp; describe how MUCH Father has restored my life in just the past few days? Seriously, I get overwhelmed just thinking about it. I think I could live alone the rest of my life, and even neglect all of my ambitions or dreams&nbsp;and just wake up with the perspective of getting to know God more so that He could be glorified MOST in me,and I would&nbsp;be the most satisfied I could ever be with just that. I am desiring nothing else.&nbsp;The Maker of the BILLIONS of stars and the universes and all of creation =&nbsp;is enough for me. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ps. I've been thinking lately ....&nbsp; what is the benefit of not believing at all? People say that there is no God and they're free to live this life to the fullest because there's no one to answer to in the end. Well to that, I say... life is maybe just a 100 years long and in case you havent paid attention, its not so prestigious or grand here on this earth. If I were to believe that this is all there is, let me say I would never enjoy one single moment because ITS NOT enough to live here alone and never know unconditional love or hope.&nbsp;<br />On the flip side?&nbsp;<br /><br />How could it be wrong to believe in something so much greater than yourself? If anything, you may begin to realize that the universe doesnt revolve around you, you may begin&nbsp;to sleep peacefully knowing that you're never to old or independent to be neglected by your REAL FATHER, you may begin to live more meaningful days when you regard others before yourself and learn how to LOVE like He does, you may-for the first time- feel you heart come ALIVE as waves of never-ending unconditional perfect love wash over you again and again when you see the cross,&nbsp;you may begin to possess qualities you never knew you could without a little help - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and self control. You may actually know true satisfaction and completeness when you realize who you are, where you came from and why you're here. If you ask me, that's what it means to live a full life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","I heard a message from the book of Revelation (chapter 5) and it changed my life. Literally. It's as if more of the scales that were over my eyes fell down and shattered on the ground as my God fed me more glorious truth. He is changing me with His word and I believe my heart is closer than it's ever been. Upon hearing truth from a passage I've read numerous times before, and being so touched deeply with gratitude - I realized something about&nbsp;this life with&nbsp;God. I realized that I&nbsp;don't think I'll ever get over it! (We aren't&nbsp;meant to! )&nbsp;I have been following Him for 7 years now, and I know I'll never get past what God has done, is doing and what we'll see of Him in the future! It's the most amazing story of deep love and grace...and justice through Jesus!&nbsp; I <strong>get to</strong> worship because of this.<br /><br />Its the&nbsp;greatest&nbsp;sense of completeness and joy, I didn't think I could ever be this...FULL.&nbsp;<br />I hope (that if you havent yet) you will turn your eyes and gaze upon the beauty of Jesus Christ and come to know Him. There is nothing else."

"event","Today was good. My heart towards work was better than the norm lately. And for that I'm grateful. My co-worker lended me one of the CDS he had in his car, and I promise I listened to one song on repeat the whole day. Do you have to ask the artist? It was Dave of course. The song ""Seek Up"". I've heard it a million times before today. But something about it today was similar to a sobering splash of cold water on a face that just woke up. I think his lyrics are just beautiful and profound and truthful at times. Necessary. Thank you Dave.
I also went to get my dress altered after work. My friend's wedding is in just 2 weeks, so we're all running last minute!( Sometimes traditions are used up too often.) I went to a creepy place to get it altered, somewhere down on the rough side of Fairfield because there's an Asian lady who guarantees a good job in a TIMELY matter. Anyway, during the drive I saw a lady on the side of the road who owned the physical characterists of what some might call a prostitute. She looked distraught. I wish I could have done something sincere for her.&nbsp;

I wonder when my whole life is poured out and there's nothing left, what I'll have to show for it.
I want to be about the things that matter even after I'm gone.
I want to know and have and give: love."

"event","<p><br />I learned a lesson today. Lately my disappointment could be triggered by my tendency to expect TOO much in PEOPLE. There's nothing wrong or more true about the idea that people can't cut it for me in this life. It's not fair to expect another human being to fill any needs that are in my heart because they DO NOT have the capacity to do it. It's literally impossible. The only one who could do that of course is God. And so I remembered that my problem lately OBVIOUSLY is NOT God, NOR people, but myself and my own perspective and expecations.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />It's like I am looking in the refrigerator for something to wear and in the closet for something to eat. I'm hungry and naked and now I know why!</p>"

Every day the world seems colder to me. I now know that my heart is lacking just PEACE in general, and I need just a little bit desperately. How can there be days when you absolutely hate everything that your life consists of? Like you've been tolerating so much for so long that one day you realize the bag on your back is just too heavy for you to continue to carry. If&nbsp;the Lord helps me with my momentary obstacles and if he helps me get past them, how is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that on days of weakness and weariness I find that I never fully let them go in the first place? That over time I've accumulated so much ...this WHOLE time I've carried them with me.&nbsp;Have my feet not left the boundaries of square 1? I'm discouraged beyond expression. I hate that I now associate growing up with loneliness and I find them always hand in hand.&nbsp;<br />I&nbsp;don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />GAHH ...Sometimes everything is&nbsp;so meaningless (ecclesiastes)&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm sure that a hug would be like winning the lottery right now<br />I'm sure that a clear night where I could see the stars would be like him bringing me back to life<br />I'm sure that a laugh would ease the pain<br />I'm sure that a night with you would heal every insecurity my heart could ever make</p>"

Everything is trying to get us to turn our eyes from the ONLY giver of HOPE, and to be sad/anxioius/worried/depressed/hopeless about our lives and the&nbsp;circumstances we find ourselves in.
""I will lift my eyes to the MAKER of the mountains I can't climb.""
""I lift my eyes unto the hills, where does my help come from? My hope comes from the Lord.""

I went and visited my mom the past 4 days. It was good to see my little sisters. 
Family is really everything in life. Who else loves you through every step? 


I find comfort in knowing that God really knows every tear I cry. 
Samantha is leaving soon and I am not trying to think about it. 


Think: 
the depth of the love you give is a good indicator at the measure of pain you'll feel when you lose the person you love. 
Is this how I think???

I know one day you won't be here, but God if I don't love you with everything and if I don't make it my personal goal to live for you to KNOW it, the regret later will be the worst pain ever."

"event","I want to go so bad. Soon. Lord take me soon. I want to serve you. Here is my life, this is me.
I think I am miserable because this is the waiting part. I think I am miserable because I know that He has something else planned for me and maybe this isnt it. I have to remember that He is in control. I have to remember that this is a learning lesson.
I am not sure why I do the things I do. I am lonely but everytime someone gets close to I push them away.&nbsp;
I think I've realized something today...
school is overrated and possibly not intended for me to finish.
Call me a cop out but I dont see how me wanting to move to Africa and just love on little orphans requires a 4 year degree. I dont like how people look down at people who didnt go to/finish college.
But then again maybe school is what I need to do.
I dont know.
I'm just thinking out the possiblities.


I'm so glad I have Jesus in my life. I am a failure and he heals me&nbsp;everyday."

"event","I know that I am by no means a trophy wife. I'm okay with it, I don't look at women who are and wish I looked like them. 

I pretty much enjoy the fact that I don't look like most people, but am attractive. I have men come up to me, do double takes when they look at me, try to talk to me while I'm driving in my car, every day, regardless of how I look. Even with my hair up and no makeup, possibly with glasses on, men try to talk to me. 

That has to count for something.

I don't like basing my mood on how men in my life are reacting to me. I don't want that to be the case, but it seems like it is. 

I know that if certain men were to call me right now and speak to me with a certain amount of affection, say nice things to me, that my douldrums mood would soar. 

I know the mistakes I've made in my relationships with people in general, especially men. I know mistakes that I still make and am learning from.

For the first time, I'm getting to know someone in an adult-like relationship, and I'm doing everything right- by not doing anything.

That's not to say that I just sit on my ass and wait for him to make advances on me, not by any means.

But I'm not playing games. 

I don't have to think about him all the time, wait for him to call, say only a little of what I mean or hint around my feelings for him. It's pretty up front and it has felt nice, up to this point. 

I am catching myself over-analyzing and getting upset about stupid things like his mood or the faces he makes around me. If he's not sugary sweet and all bear hug-y, I catch myself thinking something's wrong. 

We aren't dating, I don't know if I would call what we're doing even ""seeing"" each other. 

We're starting out as good friends who have expressed a mutual attraction to each other. We get along really well and can talk for hours and hours, which is a good thing. 

It may not even blossom into a romantic relationship, possibly just a very close friendship.

I'm afraid to ruin the latter by pursuing the former and having it crash and burn.

He's 6 and a half years older than me, but it's not as though he's this set adult dating a college girl. He's still floating around, pursuing what he wants to do. Not a loser by any means- he's kept the same steady job for years and it totally stable. He's not immature, either. In fact, I think that sometimes the age difference bothers him, just because of what some people might have to say about it. 20 and 27 seems like a big difference now, but it wouldn't be if I was out of college and a semi-settled adult as well. \

I have to write this out because it's been locked in my head for days.

I don't even feel like going out right now, but I have to make an appearance and I really want to see this band."

"event","i recently cleaned out my old room at my parents' house. in boxes and under books and in drawers, there were traces of old lover everywhere. guitar picks, hats, pictures, letters, printed out conversations and emails. 

i found a particular conversation from shortly after we ""broke up"" for lack of a better term. 

i am so sorry.

i really was a psycho. here i have been, for the past like 2 years, thinking you were this total asshole who broke my heart. that you were wrong for thinking i was overemotional and underconfident. well, you were right. i was. unfortunately, there is no fixing that image of me in your mind. if only i had the chance to show you how much i've grown and learned and changed. 

jesus christ. 

i am humiliated. 

all you tried to do was let me down easy. 

i feel like i took out all of my stephen rage on you. all of my meghan hurt. everything that wasn't going the way i thought i wanted to, i took out on you. 

while i don't regret things, i do wish i had handled things differently. here you were, this 21 year old man who had just been at war, who had been out of high school for years, getting involved with an 18 year old with no gumption or tact whatsoever.

i wish i could fix you. 

i wish i could fix us. 

this is a letter you will never get."

"event","this is why i don't talk to you anymore. or maybe why i never did. or why we don't talk. because i seem crazy. and you take me the wrong way. that's okay. you take me the way i was when you met me, confused, hysterical, and hypersensitive. i've reached this very nice plateau in my life where i accept things as they are and don't get upset or hurt. things are what they are and that's fantastic. i fight for what i want, and i can get it. maybe you're just no longer something i want. i'm sorry if you care, but everything has its ending. and things work out for the best for at least someone. i just hope that you are happy in your endeavors and that you never miss me, because it's plain that i'm not meant to be around you. we can't work if we only work alone. repression, repression, repression is our game and we've mastered it quite well. this is my release, take it and run. think i'm crazy, thing this is out of nowhere, but really, you're the one who hasn't been around. you've been nowhere, at least, nowhere around me. you're better off, because i proved too much to handle a long time ago. i'm glad i've found myself, and again, i'm even more glad that i can't say i didn't love you enough or try."

"event","I am happy.

I spent the night with Stephen last night, and nothing happened. We just slept in the same bed.

It was so nice. We hung out, listened to music. We talked about Tabitha. and Meagan. and Jessica.

I get it.

He is really crazy about Tab. She's nuts about him, and he loves that. And she's uncomplicated. It's so easy for him to just be with her, and be happy. 

And I am so happy for them. I love that they're that happy. 

This is strange. But it's genuine, so I have no reason to question it.

I'm not in love with him anymore. I love him to pieces, he is my best friend in the whole world.

But that's it.

And I'm glad."

"event","I feel like an idiot.

I was never in love. I was never loved. 

He has destroyed me. He really has. Not just him, my relationship with him. I've wasted the past two years of my life. I'm not sitting here regretting and wishing I'd done things differently. No, I just wish that as a person, I was more well-rounded, self-respecting, and confident. 

Why did I choose him to open up to, him to be my everything? 

Now I know that to allow things to get to that point, there needs to be somewhat equal reciprocation. Outwardly. For so long I've let him tell me what I want to hear, and I'm seriously doubting he meant those things. 

Maybe I'm wrong about all this. When the going gets this rough, I tend to let things go to the extreme. I want to start over. I want to leave everything I know, other than family, and just go. Just be new, and start over, and not mention my past relationships whatsoever.

Everything is beautiful, and everything hurts. Pain is beauty. Pain is exquisite. La douleur exquise.  

There is nothing that I want. I want everything and nothing. I don't want to be, and I want to be someone, something, somewhere, else. 

I am exaggerating and overreacting, and I can't stop it. These feelings must run their course and get out of my system.

I feel like I've regressed. I feel like for awhile, I have been able to go without him, to not worry about him, to not worry about whether he's worried about me. He let me in just a little, again, and I told myself not to expect anything, not to want anything, not to feel anything.

All I gathered from that night is regression and the thought that maybe I still matter. He acted concerned about me, wanted to know what's up with my life, wanted to know how I was doing. I wish I had told him how I feel, and I'm also glad I didn't. 

WHY DID YOU KISS ME, WHY DID YOU START THINGS WITH ME WHEN I WAS 14, YOU KNOW I WAS TOO YOUNG AND YOU KNEW I WOULD LOVE YOU, YOU KNEW IT YOU KNEW IT AND I LOVED YOU BACK AND YOU LOVED ME BUT I'VE BECOME SOMETHING, SOMEONE, THAT WE BOTH HATE AND I HATE YOU AND YOU HATE YOU AND YOU KNOW IT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE AWFUL AND YOU MAKE AWFUL DECISIONS AND SURROUND YOURSELF WITH AWFUL PEOPLE BECAUSE IT MAKES YOUR LIFE SEEM BETTER, MORE ACCEPTABLE. FUNNY HOW THE FEW PEOPLE WHO REALLY KNOW YOU AND LOVE YOU AND CARE ABOUT YOU FOR YOU, FOR STEPHEN CHRISTOPHER CAREY, NOT STEVE CAREY, NOT ""ROCKSTAR I'M SO COOL STEVE FUCKIN' CAREY"" YOU PUSH US OUT AND OUT AND OUT AND OUT ME TORY JESSICA YOUR MOM OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT. WHEN IS IT ENOUGH FOR YOU WHY IS IT ALWAYS TOO MUCH. I NEVER KNEW YOU COULD LOVE SOMEONE TOO MUCH UNTIL I MET YOU. WHY DID YOU LET ME, WHY DID YOU DO IT, WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP IT.

Why didn't I stop it. 

I'm so stupid and I care too much. 

I don't want to care about anything, or anyone.

I can't talk, I can't fuck anymore, I can't be myself. 

I just don't want to do anything anymore.

I'm sick of me."

"event","Things are always so hard, come fall. 

It's my second year of college, and I'm afraid it's starting out somewhat like the last.

True, I am a little older, somewhat smarter, and I've learned a whole lot...but I feel like old relationships are going in the same direction.

Stephen and I are on the outs. Things have been worse, and infinitely better, of course...but neither of those things(especially the former) console me. It's so much harder when you let someone affect you this strongly, to have problems. It puts such a huge damper on everything. Most people, if I'm mad at them or vice versa, yeah, it bothers me, but I can deal. I can move along, I don't get in this horribly defeated disposition. 

I <i>know</i> things will get better, because we've been through much worse...but he's not even attempting reconciliation. I actually called him today, and he didn't answer. He's not at work, either...just ignoring me. 

What do you do when the person you tell everything to, who knows your insides better than you do, is the one person you can't get through to? 

We haven't spoken since Friday. We haven't REALLY spoken for longer. 

Seeing someone every day isn't the same thing as spending time with them. That's just saying hi and smalltalk. 

I don't ask for anything, and I don't require loads of time or anything. Once in awhile is plenty, so long as that's good quality construction time. 

At the show last night, we didn't even look at each other. Didn't even <i>look</i>. We were total strangers in an uncrowded room. 

This is debilitating."

"event","As of late, my depression seems to have kicked in. There is something about the end of summer/beginning of fall that really fucks my shit up. I was diagnosed with clinical depression at thirteen. I was such an idiot. I used to do stupid things like pretend I was a pyromaniac and cut myself and carve my boyfriend's initials into my skin with needles. I attempted suicide at thirteen, the only thing that stopped me was my dad getting hoe early from work that day.

I never took a single pill or went to therapy for it. I've just usually blocked it out.

Well, now I'm nineteen, and it's gotten worse. I think it's quite possible that I have Bipolar disorder. I have been considering getting on medication for it, and I think the next time I go to the doctor I'm going to tell him I want to.

I had the best week with Stephen, and we're a lot closer. Sometimes when I'm with him and we're around other people, I feel alone. I don't feel want for him, I feel want for...I don't know.

Tory and I have been spending such large amounts of time together, and it's great. I've never really known someone who can share my ridiculous idiosyncracies like she does, and we don't get tired of each other. She brings out the best in me, and that is what a true friend does.

Lately, Kevin has been acting like his old self. Especially when we hang out with just Tory. It sort of breaks my heart and makes me really happy at the same time. It breaks my heart because that's the Kevin I fell in love with, that's the Kevin I've spent the past year fighting for...not the Kevin I've spent the past 10 or so months fighting with. I miss the feelings that I had when we were ""together,"" the way he made me feel, who I was when I was with him. The way he granted me independece from Stephen, and it was genuine. He didn't replace Stephen, just made it feel okay for me to move on. It kills me to know that he felt like he always played second best to Stephen...that's apparently a large part of the reason he broke things off with me. It makes me really happy to see him act like his old self because those are happy memories I have of him and of us. However, because of this...relapse, I guess you could say, I've been getting flashbacks of little things. Like how we'd be riding in his truck and he'd have me pick out a CD. Or our stupid little inside jokes that established intimacy in public. Or what it felt like when he kissed me, or things he would say to me. Specific things he said to me in that period of time. 

It's painful to miss someone who is still physically around you all the time, but is someone else."

and conversations we front in public view.

Behind fluorescent lights you sing
of ingenuity and
you have written songs of facades
and those who are conniving--

is your art your autobiography?

when we are horizontal in the dark,
between flannel and fleece,
your fingers and lips say you love me;

Your breath on my forehead is home,
and we swear we've Never been happier.

This cliff will not allow a hanger, where
we land is euphoria, and yet
you continue to crave
mediocrity, because it's easier
to succumb to potential energy
than to stare at the sun for the rest of your life.

I am everywhere in your life.

The clothes you wear, the things you have,
my hair is in your shower drain,
and you pillowcase smells like my skin,

No one's hands will ever feel right on my jaw,
or make the blood course through me faster
than you.

You are, byfar, the best disease i have ever had."

I don't think I would know how to react to being first, to being the most important thing to you. I suppose one day I want me and our family to be the most important thing to you, but as of right now, I neither expect nor want that of you.

I just want to sometimes, not even always, be a factor. Be important to you, and in your decision-making.

I know you try. I know it's not easy for you, to have obligations and appearances and contacts to keep.

I don't ask to you make sacrifices or give you ultimatums.

I don't want to have to ask you to do things for me. I don't like things being done for me, I love doing everything for you and I know you're incredibly grateful- you've told me more than enough times. 

This is not about reciprocation or feeling like you owe me anything.

I guess I just set myself up for disappointment."

"event","kevin,

i know i take things too seriously a lot of times. however, i am not always being sensitive. i think you need to realize the difference between being affected and being dramatic. all of the time, i wish we could go back to how we were: fun, still nice to each other but incredibly honest. in that period, we laughed together and formed little jokes, we cried together, i confided things in you that a lot of my best friends don't even know, and i let you in. i let you in. i let you in. 
we were every type of good relationship together, in that time. we had the strong base of friendship, of common interests and viewpoints- and the honesty to disagree with one another. we saw each other's flaws and still remained close.
and then everything changed. i supposed i wanted more, even though i was willing to settle for less, and you got freaked out and realized how heavy things would get.
you breaking it off(sexually/romantically) did not prevent things from getting heavy.
i'll come out and say it: you broke my heart. you broke my fucking heart. everyone that i've ever had serious feelings for, it took time to develop that. i had to get to know them first, to <i>form</i> a connection. we had sparks the first time we spoke to each other.
what happened? 
probably the most hurtful thing about it, was the lack of honesty. the unanswered questions of ""why?"" and ""what happened?"" 
i accepted your reasoning of you not being ready, of not knowing what you wanted. i accepted it, and respected your wishes. 
i think it was the worst when you said ""i don't want to get too deeply involved with you."" 
you said this AFTER we spent huge amounts of time together, AFTER i confided so much in you, and you in me, AFTER we'd made love several times...and the worst part is, i didn't even really consider a romantic relationship with you until you turned it into just that. you made the first move, and every move after that.
did you use me? are you embarrassed of me? are you afraid of me? are you afraid of love? of yourself?
i don't know the answers to any of these questions. for some reason, i have conflicting feelings on all of them.
it's my grave and i have to lie in it.
i guess you've never felt it. what it feels like to feel completely changed by another person's entrace in your life, the kind of effect that stays with you. 
with you, i felt like i didn't need anything else. i didn't need other men, i didn't need any of my old games or comforts. you were enough, enough, enough.
it hurts to be pouring these things out. it hurts to admit them, it hurts to know they go on unread and unwanted. 
this is the honesty i cannot share with you.
you are so important in my life that i sacrifice my personal feelings to keep you near. to not scare you away, but in doing this, i think you percieve it as me pushing you away. 
i put up a front, and i admit it. i won't lie to you; my heart dropped when i found out you were with kristi. that she was your <i>girlfriend</i>. not even just the fact alone, but also because you even compared us when you told me about her when you first started casually seeing her, and said that i was a ""much more worthwhile individual."" what does that <i>mean</i>? 
someone close to me, when they found out that you had a girlfriend, was shocked. they said ""he has a girlfriend??"" and i said yes, and they said ""he doesn't love her."" and i asked what they meant, and they said ""i see how he watches you, acts around you, talks to you. the girlfriend is a cover, a distraction, something simpler than you.""
you could be incredulous at that opinion, say that person doesn't know you, and that their opinion is meaningless. but like me, your face and eyes give you away. do i believe that person's opinion? sometimes. sometimes, going over the facts, going over things that were said, i believe it. sometimes not. 
later, after meeting her and hearing about her, that same person remarked that the reason you dated her so hastefully was because she was the total opposite of me, right down to appearance. i am a woman who cares immensely, and she is a woman who doesn't. when did indifference become a valued quality? when i am dark and plump, she is pale and bony. where my interests are in the arts and fashion and deep beauty, she likes bad music and video games and ugly, harsh things. where i would love you, she could leave you.
if that is the case, if you are afraid of me and getting too close to me, here are my thoughts: why do you have to have a plan for everything. i think you need to let go, you have so much courage in other areas, why not this one. why deprive yourself of something that could be so good for you, even if only momentarily? how do you think you gain the knowledge of experience in life? by <i>experiencing</i>. you can't protect yourself from everything, sometimes you have to trust, even if you know it's a risk. i don't have to tell you about risk, you've experienced it in so many areas. why not this one? you have to get over past heartaches and mistakes, you DID learn from them, and move along. you're 21. you have so much ahead of you, yet you've already experienced so much. 
i really don't know how to feel, maybe that's why i act certain ways.
it's not that i'm a hypersensitive person, or that i analyze everything to death. everything you make me think and feel, everything you say and do to me affects me so much stronger than average people, because you're inside me. i let you in, and trust you with so much. you see the ugliest parts of me, the weakest, and i feel like you take light of that. you said you didn't want to deal with anything heavy, well, you were too late. 
i think you feel like you can't even joke around and have fun with me anymore. that is not the case at all. you overcompensate on the occasions when you're trying to be sensitive to me, and so we fight anyway. 
we fight because emotions run high.
i feel like i'm always trying to impress you, to please you in some way. when did i stop being just plain me? 
i suppose when my heart got broken. why can't i be hurt, and angry, and sad? just because i don't tell you doesn't mean that i can't feel them. after all, look what happens when i open up to you. you freeze up, or you blow it off because you think i'm feeling too much.
the worst thing to tell a woman when she's upset that she's being overly dramatic, that she's too sensitive. yes, it's important to help people work on their flaws, but don't do it all at once.
sometimes a girl just needs to cry. just let it all out, and be held and not questioned.
i would think you know by now that i don't need prompting to discuss things that i want to. i do it, in my own time.
i can't tell you how many times, when we were fighting or you were pestering me to tell you what was wrong, how i wanted to scream at you, ""i still have feelings for you. i still think we could be together, and happy. that's what's wrong with me, getting a taste of what could be and having it yanked away because you're too much of a pussy to let it happen!""
that wouldn't be fair.
i think most of what's wrong with us, is just that.
things that wouldn't be wrong, if we had worked out. if you had let us work out."

unrivaled grace: show it, i mean.
unrivaled grace: i mean, you probably have built up anger and resentment towards me
Marley Ramen: i was upset with you for awhile, but i understand.  you're doing your own thing.  i suppose we  grew apart?  i don't know.
unrivaled grace: i don't want to be grown apart.
unrivaled grace: i'm not doing my own thing
Marley Ramen: but, when it's become an inconvenience for me to be your friend, i just had to quit caring
unrivaled grace: i'm doing what everyone else wants me to do and i hate it
unrivaled grace: you're NOT an inconvenience
unrivaled grace: at all.
unrivaled grace: i want to be close again.
Marley Ramen: i'd love that
unrivaled grace: i want you to be the first person i call
unrivaled grace: when something happens, i want the first thought to be, i wish meghan was here to see that
unrivaled grace: or better yet
unrivaled grace: i hope you will be there
Marley Ramen: it's funny you say that.
unrivaled grace: to see things.

unrivaled grace: and i thought to myself
unrivaled grace: sure, i hang out with awesome people. and they care about me and thinks highly of me.
unrivaled grace: but i don't feel loved the way i did by you
unrivaled grace: i was thinking
unrivaled grace: christen
unrivaled grace: what the FUCK are you doing
unrivaled grace: you're throwing the best friend you've ever had away
unrivaled grace: and it's not right
Marley Ramen: stop it
Marley Ramen: you're making me cry
unrivaled grace: i'm sorry
unrivaled grace: but i'm crying too
unrivaled grace: and i have to say all this
unrivaled grace: because i feel so torn up that you ever thought you weren't important to me, or that i didn't love you as much or at all anymore
unrivaled grace: i hate that i make you feel forgotton
unrivaled grace: forgotten?
unrivaled grace: see i can't even spell right
unrivaled grace: (heh.)

unrivaled grace: i feel like you feel deceived
unrivaled grace: like, someone would see a picture of me
unrivaled grace: and say ""oh who is that""
unrivaled grace: first of all
unrivaled grace: it's shitty for someone in your life to not know who i am
unrivaled grace: and secondly
Marley Ramen: hhahahah
unrivaled grace: for you to be able to say oh, that's christen.,..we used to be best friends
unrivaled grace: but then she turned into an asshole
Marley Ramen: i don't say things like that
unrivaled grace: maybe not
unrivaled grace: but you feel them
unrivaled grace: and i know you do
unrivaled grace: i still refer to you as my best friend
unrivaled grace: and then i'm like
unrivaled grace: yeah i'm not hers though
unrivaled grace: i suck
unrivaled grace: i hate myself.
unrivaled grace: what the fuck happened to me
Marley Ramen: i don't know what happened, i mean..
Marley Ramen: things got out of control for me
unrivaled grace: and i couldn't deal with it the right way
unrivaled grace: and threw myself into other things
unrivaled grace: i swear, meghan
unrivaled grace: i don't even know who the fuck i am anymore

unrivaled grace: and i'm an asshole
unrivaled grace: and i'm fixing it
Marley Ramen: i understand all of that, i don't have anyone to talk to anymore.  lee, he's just not there in that kind of way
unrivaled grace: ahhhhhhhh
Marley Ramen: so things just build up and i almost feel like i don't even know what i'm doing, or why i'm doing the things i do.
unrivaled grace: mm hmm
Marley Ramen: just all of these things in life, and things are just fucking complicated

Marley Ramen: it really means a lot for you to say this to me.
unrivaled grace: too bad old blue is gone.
unrivaled grace: well, it's a lot for me to say. and i mean it more than anything.
Marley Ramen: i dont think this is something that's hard to fix
Marley Ramen: it shouldn't be for us anyway
Marley Ramen: i know this sounds retardedly corny, but life is different without you in it
Marley Ramen: in a bad way
unrivaled grace: life is nothing without you in it.
unrivaled grace: and i mean that.
unrivaled grace: things feel stale
unrivaled grace: and incomplete

Sometimes, well, a lot of the time, I wonder what is going to happen between Stephen and I in the future. I think I can handle us not being together- but that's going to take a LOT of changing on my part. See, the problem is: no one has ever been able to compare with Stephen, and I fear that no one ever will. He's not some wonderful man, hell, I can count on both hands opportunities I've passed up with men who would treat me infinitely better- but there's just something about him.

It's his smell, mainly. And the way it feels when he touches me. The way he feels. His eyes. His hair, his neck. His feet. Every part of him, I know so well, and cherish so deeply- sometimes I think I'm going to burst. It's not entirely physical: the physical and emotional feed to and from each other."

But I feel more sure of myself after I watch Sex and the City. Well, most of the time.

See, maybe it's so addictive because a) the fashion, and b) i can draw extremely pertinent parallels to my personal relationships, from Carrie's relationships with Big and Aidan.

Stephen is my Big. He's there long enough for me to just grasp, and the next second he's slipping through my fingers- and his own through someone else's. He's vain, conceited, and important. But that arrogance is perhaps what draws me in- as it does Carrie. As many problems as they have, they always seem to run to each other when it feels like they have nothing left. Big knows her better than any man has, and has let her down more and worse than any man ever has. Maybe that's why they're (we're?) so close. When you go through everything with someone, it's hard not to include them in everything in the future.

And of course, who would be my personal Aidan but Kevin. Aidan is everything that Big wasn't: considerate, publicly affectionate, strong in his beliefs, better looking, more of a ""man's man."" He's a carpenter, for Christ's sake. He's so great in these so many ways- but the thing about their relationship was, Carrie had to change a lot of things about herself. He encouraged (well, pretty much demanded, in his own passive=aggressive way) her to be less indulgent, more philanthropic. Their relationship forces her to stop smoking, to calm down, to act different. He even tries to make her cut off her relationship with Big entirely, but she refuses and it becomes a huge wall between them.

I'm just so lost."

He gave me this awed look and said ""I love you."" I asked him why he said that, as in, what was the occasion. He said, ""I've just never known someone who knows themself so well. It's amazing.""

What about these fronts we put up for people? 

Jason knows me better than most people. I don't know if it's that, or something else, that makes me act the specific way I do with him. Is it comfort in my personality? Is it comfort in him? Is it because of how I want him to feel about me, think of me?

I can never answer my own questions about myself.

Does that mean I don't <i>really</i> know who I am?

Another front: Kevin. We spent time together for the first time in weeks. I mean time together as in, just the two of us, not doing anything but talking. There is a lack of front I put up there, because that man can read me like a book. I said to him tonight, ""I think I shouldn't tell you all the things I do, and just write them down instead."" When he asked me why, I said, ""Well, because I tell you every little detail. That's not interesting."" That's not stuff he wants or cares to know. The last thing I want to be is boring. I'm already annoying, there's no changing that.

Anyway, I guess I was kind of let down because almost he entire night felt forced, it felt like we were making small talk. Jobs, friends, Christmas, whatever. Small talk. Shit I would say to relatives, for the most part.

He, among everyone else, doesn't know how to deal with my emotional side. By emotional, I mean negative <i>and</i> profound. I point out something I find amazing and beautiful, he says ""Okay."" I'm not insulted because I know that's just how he reacts. It's not a big deal, just an observation.

I don't want to be depressed. I don't know if I think I'm depressed. 

Sometimes, a girl just needs to cry about nothing and everything. And not justify it, and not try to make sense of it. Sometimes it needs to be in front of people, sometimes alone. Whatever. I try to be discreet. I can't count the number of times I did that today and tonight. I think Kevin would understand that, had he noticed my tears."

But there are a couple of pictures that someone, either Kevin or Lindsay took, that I'm in, and they caught me at moments I wasn't posing- an I'm not smiling. I don't look pretty, or happy. I look terrible. Tired and sad and angry and like they caught me doing something wrong.

Is this reflective of my being as a whole?

Is my bounciness, my crazy personality, an act? Am I posing for pictures that aren't being taken?

What's even scarier than that being the truth, is that I'm not even sure if I can refute that.

Maybe that's what Kevin is always talking about.

When someone isn't paying attention to me, when I'm not aware of being watched, do I start thinking about bad things? Things that depress me, or anger me? 

I've always been able to say I'm an overall happy individual.

Can I still tell the truth?"

"event","I said I would finish my explanation of Kevin and I's problems, so I will before I address my next contemplation.

Kevin and I's problem is that we're always fighting to stay conscious of each other's state of wellness. I told him earlier, ""You're always checking my face to see how I react to you and the things around me, and if I'm not smiling you combard me with questions."" I suppose I do the same thing to him. We give each other too much attention, and we feel the need to talk about everything. 

I mean, we have a serious talk and/or fight DAILY. 

He asked me, ""What's our problem?""

We try way too hard to please each other. Or protect each other. Or take care of each other. '

And we do it in different ways, and/or at different times, ergo, we get annoyed with each other and fight.

That's why we clash. 

Last night, once we got a lot of things off our chests and whatnot, we relaxed and didn't fight about anything.

I blame a lot of this on me. I try to be a certain way around him, act a certain way. And I just need to relax. Chill out, take things as they come.

What happened to us?

When we first met and started hanging out separately from our mutual group of friends, we had a little romance fling going. I don't think we were under the ""sex haze"" or in the phase were you don't know each other and are totally nice to each other. We spent an extraordinary amount of time together, did everything together. We became extremely close, extremely fast, and when we stepped back to breathe and look at things, he freaked out and I wanted more. I loved how things were going, I had never met anyone like him or anyone who sparked things inside me like he does. And he decided he didn't want to get ""too heavily involved"" with me. To this day, I'm still not entirely sure why or what he meant by that. But I wanted to tell him ""I think it's a little too late for that."" I didn't. 

Once again, my passion, compassion, and desire to please someone else got the best of me, and scared someone away. I don't think I'm more emotional than the average person, I just express every emotion right then when I feel it. I may not say it, but if you can see my face you know how I'm feeling.

And so, Kevin and I were not Kevin and I. We became ""just friends"" which was basically, me still wanting him and him pretending not to notice. And one day, I finally just got over it. I told him that fact much later than I actually did. 

I can't do that to myself. He just didn't want me. I don't know why, he doesn't either, or so he told me. I think I'm just too much for him. At least, at his condition I am. 

I'm somewhat jealous of those girls who just ""don't care."" 

Stephen, my longest and closest best male friend- is currently dating Meaghan(whom I love), and she is so chill. Never lets anything get to her, doesn't get mad when they have plans and he calls her at the last minute because yet again ""something came up."" That's what he loves about her, she doesn't nag him, she doesn't tell him what to do or what she wants him to do, she doesn't ask anything of him. And it pays off, because it gives him the drive to do things and figure out ways to please her. 

Kevin is dating Kristi(who is pretty cool as well), and she's apparently another one of those girls. It was a big ouch when he told me that too. I took it personally. Well, it was the wrong conversation to tell me that in, too. This was before they were officially dating, or at least, before I knew about it. We had been planning on going to my friend Kelly's birthday party for about two weeks, and the night before, he drove me home from the Art Bar, and as he was walking me to my door, I reminded him of the party the next night. He asked me if he could bring her, and I was so surprised that I kind of just stumbled out with, ""Um..sure..I guess...If you want to. I mean, I don't know if she'll like it.."" and he asked me why, and I said ""Well, they're the dancers. They're all kinda fluffy and ridiculous girls."" He said ""Well, I don't think it would bother her. She doesn't care about much."" and he looked me in the eye and said ""That's what's so cool about her.""

I took that as a personal insult. Maybe I shouldn't have, maybe he meant nothing by it. But what if he did? He's told me before that I let things get to me too easily, that I can't let things go, etcetera. But she is the girl he started seeing immediately after he broke things off with me, and even told me that I am a ""much more worthwhile individual overall.""

I was indignant. The nerve! How DARE he ask to bring a date to MY friend's birthday party when he's supposed to be accompanying ME? The scenario would have been us walking in, me seeing all my friends from high school and whatnot, and introducing them like ""Hey, these are my friends Kevin and Kristi."" and they would have shook hands or whatever, and then the two of them would have just talked to each other the whole time while I hung out with my friends. 

The day of the party, I was planning on telling him he didn't have to come. I didn't want him there if that's what he wanted to do, was hang out with her. I invited him because I wanted him to meet my friends, to see a little more into my life and social interaction with people I love. So why make him do that if he doesn't want to? What a waste of heartache.

Anyway, he didn't bring her because it was a guestlist only party. I still wasn't sure about bringing him with me, I didn't want to drag him along and have him be pissy all night because he was waiting to leave. 

We ended up having a lot of fun, of course. I got ridiculously trashed, couldn't walk independently, and ended up getting emotional to the point of crying. It wasn't really even about anything, I was just drunk. It happens. 

Of course, ever-aware Kevin wanted to know what the hell was bothering me, and when I tried(unsuccessfully) to explain that I was just drunk and wasn't really thinking about anything, he got mad because he thought I was being elusive- which made me cry harder. We fought terribly all the way home and up to my front door. I dragged myself inside and tried to sleep, got the spins terribly, ended up vomiting while in the shower, and then in the sink after I tried to go back to bed, and passing out.

The next morning I woke up and found he had sent me a text message right after he left, around three a.m., that just said ""<3"" (it's a heart). I felt so terrible about how ridiculous I was, I vaguely remembered saying rude things to him like to go away and leave me alone because he isn't Stephen, things of that nature.

So I got up, got dressed, and decided I was going to do something nice for him. I decided to surprise him by picking him up and taking him to La Nopalera for lunch, on me. So I left my house, and on the way to his, called to make sure he was awake. 

When I called, he said he actually needed to get home and help his mother paint. 

Which meant he stayed the night out.

Which meant he stayed at Kristi's. 

Bad feelings. Not jealousy, not resentment, not really even sadness. Just bad, like I had tried to pet a dog and it bit the fuck out of me. 

I think I decided then and there to give him his space, to not call him unless I needed to, and not to ask him to hang out. I realized then that I had lost my ""surrogate boyfriend,"" because although we were nothing but friends, he was always the person I brought with me, who I went out with, who came to family dinner or parties or functions, the person whom was sort of my automatic date. We went to those places together, in the same car. Traveling companion.

I can survive it. Not a big deal. I have other friends. He's just another one of them.

I have a lot of question for him, that I'll eventually be able to bring up. 

I want to ask him why we're friends. Why, if we have so many problems and issues with our relationship, does he stick around?  Things of that nature.

Anyway, this is it for now."

"event","Tonight I had my best friend say to me, ""You're a beautiful girl. And you'd be gorgeous if you lost weight.""

I almost threw up on him. All these feelings and thoughts rushed through me, such as ""How fucking <i>dare</i> he?!"" and ""I know, asshole."" and things of that nature. Also, memories of former boyfriends, love interests, friends, saying it. 

Trust me, I fully know they're all well-meaning people and they're just trying to help. 

But am I wrong for feeling hurt, angered, upset at that idea? Well, maybe not at the idea, perhaps at the gall for them to say that to me and honestly believe I'll be grateful, slap my forehead and say ""Oh my god! I never thought of that! Diet starts tomorrow! Thank you for pointing that out!"" and smile and be on my merry way to thinness and full attractiveness?

Definitely not.

I looked at him, said ""Thanks"" sarcastically, and then he pressed on and asked me how much I weigh.

I stood up and said I was going home, hugged the few friends left dancing goodbye, and proceeded to walk to my car. As I was walking the street, I looked back and saw him walk out the door. I walked faster. I was almost to my car and about to get in when he ran up behind me as fast as he could, threw himself against the door, and refused to move. He made me talk to him, and I kept insisting on not doing so.

I was belligerent. He was bitingly sarcastic and reasonable. I finally managed to open the door and wedge myself in it, however, he was blocking me from closing the door. After a minute of arguing, I finally agreed to let him sit in the passenger's seat and talk to me.

So he did. And we did. 

And it's better. I explained to him why I couldn't talk to him about such a thing, why I didn't feel comfortable, and that he should respect my wishes. He apologized for hurting me, I apologized for flipping out because I know he's just concerned about my well-being. And we just got into really great conversation.

""That old chestnut.""

One of his favorite expressions, certainly applicable to the conversation that followed.

He asked me why it is that we fight so much, why we clash so greatly so much.

I think we agreed that we have a lot of misconceived notions about each other's reaction and thoughts on each other. Him moreso than I.

And we send each other mixed signals. 

Yet, there is something that holds us together, keeps us working at it. 

More on this later."

"event","I thought about childhood today. 

I miss the days where the only man whom I wanted to dance with, whose hand I wanted to hold, whom I would hug and be excited to see, was my father, grandfather, or uncle. These are all close family members who will always love me for who I am, no matter what's wrong with me.

In an interview with Gwyneth Paltrow, she told a story about when she was eleven and her father took her to Paris for a weekend. She said they had a beautiful time going to museums and walking around, going to nice restaraunts, seeing the sights and just spending time together. She said at the end of the trip, he said to her, ""Do you know why you and I had our weekend here, and Mommy and your brother had their time together?"" And she said ""Why?"" and he said, ""Because I wanted you to see Paris for the first time with a man who will always love you, no matter what.""

A beautiful sentiment.

I have had a similar experience with my dad. When I was 16, he gave me a diamond ring for Christmas. I said ""Daddy, this looks like an engagement ring. Why did you give it to me?"" He thought for a second and he said, ""Well, I wanted to be the first man to put a diamond on your finger.""

I cried because it was so beautiful and a moment in which I felt so incredibly loved.

I am so lucky to have the people who love me in my life."

"event","""Summer time and the wind is blowing outside in lower Pennsylvania. 
And I don't know what I'm doing in this city, 
The sun is always in my eyes, 
It crashes through the windows, And I'm sleeping on the couch""

THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL!  

""I've never been so ALIVE!""

I now find myself working at least 10 hours a day and working hard to get my deadlines finished before they are due, but that mission is almost next to impossible.  It is Saturday and I am definitely at work.  But you know what, I luv it.  The constant challenge and the independence.  

FREEDOM!

When I finally finish work or even before it starts each morning, I do one of my most beloved passions in the world...DRIVING!  Now that the sun is out and shining brightly with warm breezes, ""GOSH!"" I luv it.  Especially since I have a sunroof in my car.  I play my music and just sit back enjoying this simple pleasure, though it may become costly with the price of gas going up in the US.  Oh well enjoy it while it last.  

So this leads me to tell all of you who own a car or know someone who does. Go driving on a sunny day.  Where?  Who cares, just go and listen to ur favorite tunes.  SMILE!  FORGET! 

WE ALL DESERVE HAPPINESS!"

"event","MAN!!! These past two weeks have been flying by.  Oh and the weather has been great for last week.  Tanning and sunshine is all I am thinking about.  Plus girls!  Cannot forget them :)

Not much to say on my daily life though, just work and more work.  I met with a Congressman this past weekend on domestic relations.  Nothing grand to mention because it was simply a promotional calling for him.  

My new job has been fun.  I work a lot, but I enjoy it.  Almost every minute of every day.  

No philosophical thoughts at the moment.  So if u were hoping for something interesting, I am sorry :(  

Enjoy the weather(if u have the same weather that I am enjoying)"

"event","My Easter went quite well.  Starting Friday evening, I left with my cousins, whom are the same age as me, to our mountain houses.  With us we took 4 dirt bikes and a 4-wheeler.  Saturday brought us an unexpected surprise.  Almost 2 inches of snow fell on our side of the mountain and a thick fog(one of those that u see in scary movies) covered the land.  Now a sensible person would say that this is too dangerous to ride and call it quits.  HA HA HA!!!!  NOT ME, MISTER SUPERMAN! 
 On a 4-wheeler, riding at top speeds I sank my ride in some of the deepest mud I have ever seen.   WOOHOO!!! I was freezing, but I was luving life.  The fog with the snow covered trees gave me a feeling that I had crossed into some magical realm where Dwarves worked under the mountain and elves lived in the trees.  Let us not forget the unicorns and dragons that could cross ur path any second.  As I was day dreaming another tsunami of mud water came crashing down on me as I ran thru another pool.  
 Towards the end of the day, after drinking some beer (yeah real hick right) and warming myself back up, my cousins and decided to go to the haunted coal mine. Yeah really, there is a coal mine in this one mountain that has a lake next to it.  Now to create the effect for u, some 60 to 100 or so years ago, this region of Pennsylvania was a huge coal mining area.  This one mine in particular was filled with hussle and bussle of miners who worked for a local mining company.  Then with no warning, the mining stopped and the miners just disappeared.  No one knows where they went or how they just disappeared.  To this day, one can travel to the mine, which is quite a distance from civilization and find all the equipment and the mine still sitting there.  STRANGE HUH?!!
 Ok, to finish my Easter weekend, I went back home near Philly on Sunday morning and had dinner with my mother's side of the family.  That was all."

"event","Hello there Everyone!!! 
 I bet many of you thought that I had died or something close to that.  Well I have not died yet, but I will someday.  As for right now I am career transitioning again.  The last time many of us corresponded, I was looking for a career.  Right now that is not the situation.  I am leaving my job as a Software/Systems/Test Engineer and Project Manager in Atlantic City and moving back home.  One does not know how much family and friends are worth, till they are gone.  So I am taking a HUGE pay cut and going to work for a small civil engineering company in West Chester, PA, USA.  
 
 Well enough about me, I have been trying to catch up on everyone's journal entries for the past month or so, but I cannot absorb all the information.  Therefore, if you would be so kind as to leave a little info about ur current situation.  I miss hearing from everyone.  
 
 Lastly I would like to apologize to everyone who I left behind when I started working.  I still am intrigued by everyone's life and wish that I could have kept up with all of you. 
 
 Ok now I am going to finish up my last two days of work and smile about life.  I just wish this rain would stop.  This past winter must have set records across all of North America for rain fall/mixed with some snow.  The whole continent deserves a beautiful spring and summer."

I am still in shock, because I never called them nor provided them with any information.&nbsp; In truth, I was actually moving in a different direction.&nbsp; Well we shall see what aspires from this.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Last week I went to an interview down in DC and it was not cool.&nbsp; I arrived to the area a hour early, but for some reason the road, which the company was located near, could not be found.&nbsp; First, I go searching and get lost.&nbsp; Second, a car decided to switch lanes in front of traffic coming the opposite direction. This created an huge accident, which I did not care about at all, because I was extremely frustrated that for the past 45 minutes I had been searching for this stupid road.&nbsp; So I next decide to wave down a cop and have myself pulled over.&nbsp; She had no idea where this road was and when we go to look it up, all we find&nbsp;was NOTHING!&nbsp; I decided to turn around and 20 minutes in the opposite direction I come across the darn road.&nbsp; As you can probably guess, it did not end there.&nbsp; Of course I go the wrong direction and find myself talking to people at a local community office.&nbsp; Thankfully they were bored out of their minds with their jobs, so they were more than willing to help me search for the place.&nbsp; So Chris finally shows up to the interview a whole hour late.&nbsp; The interviewer did not care, however, because it turned out that his job was boring and the job that I was being interviewed for was boring as well.&nbsp; Now one may think that this would end this horrible ordeal, but this was not so AGAIN.&nbsp; On my way home, I decided to take a nap at a rest stop, because I had worked till 2 that morning and only got a small nap in before heading to DC, which is 3 hours away.&nbsp; Well I am awakened by a bright flash light and a state trooper behind the light.&nbsp; So I took a quick look around and find the entire lot and rest stop empty, except me of course.&nbsp; It turns out that a serious gas leek was occurring and the place was evacuated a hour before.&nbsp; But no one decided to take a quick look at the only car in the lot.&nbsp; Nice of them to let me start my car up that uses a spark to begin the whole thermodynamic process.&nbsp; Woohoo...BOOM!&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I came over here last night, because I could not stand staying at home.&nbsp; I had to get out of the house.&nbsp; As soon as I arrived, we went out and bought some 40's and then had a few cigars.&nbsp; --</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>I LUV CIGARS, THOUGH THEY ARE CONSIDERED EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS TO MY HEALTH--&nbsp; </FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>After finishing off the 40's, my cousin, John's girlfriend called us an told us about a party at her friend's house.&nbsp; So we decided to join in the fun since there was free beer.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Arriving to the house, it appeared as if no one was there.&nbsp; So the first image coming to my mind was of about 8 people drinking inside and watching TV.&nbsp; Complete losers, who have never known the opposite sex except for maybe the band bus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was starting to worry, but as soon as I opened the door, a different image became clear to me.&nbsp; This girl named Megan was doing a kegg stand with about 10 people standing around her counting.&nbsp; Booze everywhere and there was music.&nbsp; I had to ask myself, why was it so dark outside and little noise to announce the party.&nbsp; It turns out that Megan, who is partial owner of the house, is in police training and cannot afford to be involved in any civil misdemeanors.&nbsp; This made me feel a little more comfortable about the situation.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Well I started drinking immediately and one must remember that I had already drank a 40 and a half back at my cousin's house.&nbsp; Oh another point that I must mention.&nbsp; This entire drinking expedition begun, because I did not have a graduation party.&nbsp; So my cousins wished to give me a belated one.&nbsp; I did not argue with this fact.&nbsp; Back to the story.&nbsp; So I drank and drank and the girls at this place, whom I have never met, were really trying to take me upstairs.&nbsp; I was like WO!&nbsp; At no point did I wish to become involve with any of these females, since I knew nothing about them and they were a little...um...how should I put this...</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>NOT MY TYPE.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>This Megan girl kept at it though, the entire night.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>Until I decided to get out of there.&nbsp; Then she was like, let me tell u 3 things.&nbsp; (1) I really like u cuz ur a West Pointer (2) I think ur really, really cute (3) repeats number 2.&nbsp; She was really drunk and I was not interested.&nbsp; But the buzz that I got from the entire night, definitely made it worth the while.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma color=#999999><STRONG>I have a problem world.&nbsp; I find it difficult for me to be attracted to someone who is over weight.&nbsp; I do not wish to be like this, but it is how I am.&nbsp; Let me tell u my story.&nbsp; </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma color=#999999>As many of u know I was adopted when I was 8, but what many of u do not know is my life before my adoption.&nbsp; There are many stories to tell, but there is one in particular that pertains to my current flaw.&nbsp; At the age of 4, I moved in with a family where only the mother and daughter lived, with&nbsp;two boys.&nbsp; One of the boys&nbsp;was&nbsp;named Angel who was 18 years old.&nbsp; Angel was mentally retarded.&nbsp; The other boy I do not remember his name, but he was younger than me and was African American.&nbsp; I came into this family with my younger cousin of about a month difference, who I believed to be my brother.&nbsp; Because I was the oldest, I took on the leadership role and grew up immediately.&nbsp; I am not ashamed for this factor, because I believe that this is one reason why I am able to attend the United States Military Academy.&nbsp; But this is not my problem, my problem has to do with my dislike towards overweigth individuals.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma color=#999999>Now both the mother and daughter were extremely overweight and they had a great dislike towards Angel and my foster brother(the african american).&nbsp; I did not fully understand their discontent towards them at 4, but I hated it all the same.&nbsp; This is just the icing on the cake however.&nbsp; As time went on, we kids would make mistakes.&nbsp; But instead of punishing us accordingly, both the mother and daughter would hit us.&nbsp; Now I could not stand this and I luved my brothers.&nbsp; So after some time, I would start lying for my brothers and take the beatings.&nbsp; Yet this continuing enslavement by these two women, only developed and increased my dislike towards those who are overweight.&nbsp; I HATE THEM FOR THIS!&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma color=#999999>This is not an excuse for my ignorance, because this illness of mine hurts others.&nbsp; There is a slight positive to this entire situation and that is my awareness.&nbsp; Over the years, I have been working hard to curve this judgment.&nbsp; I have learned that once I get to know someone, I can look past most of the physical features.&nbsp; However, this does not appear to carry over into my luv life.&nbsp; I cannot find it in my heart yet, to care for someone who is not to my specifications.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Tahoma color=#999999>So here is a glimpse into my non-superman qualities.&nbsp; This might also give many of u an understanding of why I find working out such a luv in my life.&nbsp; I am sorry to all of you who believed in me and have been disappointed by my ignorance.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","Sorry, I have been away since Thursday.  So let me tell all of you my story.  

Thursday: I woke-up and pack in the dark at 5 in the morning.  Then drove down to Washington D.C.  I had this job convention called SACC(Service Academy Career Conference).  89 big name companies were there looking for only academy graduates.  That Thursday was only the initiation phase.  They simply reminded us of what we needed and how to present ourselves to the employers for interviews.  That night I went to bed and called it quits.  

Friday:  A new day and a great opportunity to shine. Arriving at the conference at 0830, I started immediately with making a scene.  Nothing big this time, just talking real loud and finding out as much information about each employer as I could.  Then I began my choosing of companies.  Beginning with the Secret Service, I received a cool pen and a message to finish my stupid resume that I have been working on for a month now.  Its freakin 33 pages long and requires in-depth analysis of my personal life, which I understand, but hate. Next came some stupid graduate school.  One that meant nothing to me so I can continue on with the companies.  I met with many DOD companies, such as Lockheed Martin, Sparta and many others.  None of them did I receive any second interviews with, which slightly confused me, but I can understand, since I was in a room full of individuals similar to myself.  There was a strange occurrence though.  The CIA, whom I have been applying with for a few months, came up to me and mentioned a position.  The strange thing was that the position was the identical position that I have been applying to for 2 months.  The agent mentioned that that would change.  Another agency was the State Department.  They appear to need someone with a civil engineering background, an international law background, and the ability to speak another language.  To their surprise(after I handed them my resume), I fit the profile perfectly.  So they mentioned that they would contact me within two weeks.  A job that I did land a second interview with, was Legg Mason.  Legg Mason is a Financial group who deals with large company finance.  They are huge in the private sector.  I was like WOW!!!  Well here's the job.  The employer needs someone with a law background to be a legal consultant for their company.  Not only did I fit the picture, but he liked how I was so interpersonal.  I was like YES YES YES!!!!!!!!  So I have an interview setup on Wednesday, but I first have to escape this place.  There were a few other companies, but they were of little interest to me.  Then came my drive back North in a thunderstorm.  I went home to Philly that night.  

Saturday: I woke-up and threw on another suit.  This time it was for a Holy Communion.  My 7 yr. old cousin received his sacrament.  I was so proud of him.  All the kids were in their little outfits and my cousins were so cute.  I wish I had some pictures to put on this page, b/c I know all of you would agree.  Well after that I went North.  That night was fun.  I shall leave that to everyone's imagination. 

Sunday: I came back to this freakin place.  West Point sucks."

"event","I always complain about my school, but what school can give you this type of power.  Some IT cadets were working on a protype program that does something with something.  Whatever, what intrigued me was when one of the cadets informed an instructor that the map given to them was incomplete.  Then the cadet requested a satelite photo to be taken of an entire county so that they could use a more accurate source for the program.  Satelite photograph??? Can your school request satellite photographs whenever they want it.  
Today I gave my presentation on a design for a parking garage.  My visuals were great.  I spent all week working on them and designing a garage from scratch, however, I failed to prep my actually presenting.  This became apparent when I gave it.  Man I lost my spot twice and used the word ""basically"" once.  There were two ""ums"" and gosh knows whatelse I did wrong.  
The good news for today is that I'm pretty much done, except for a portion of my coloquium presentation that I have to give tomorrow.  I do not care though.  All I want to do is sleep and graduate.  So soon!!!!!!"

"event","What day is today?  Man Saturday.  Gosh where does all the time go.  Yesterday I was at a conference in NYC for business law.  The topic of conversation was directed at the Coalition and their efforts to bring democracy to Iraq.  The commander of the Jordanian military was there, an Israeli General, the Commandant for the Australian military Academy, a Colonel from Japan, a South Korean General(Maj. Gen. Moon), Mr. Uras from Turkish Mission to the UN, Rear Admiral Dymock from Britain, Mr. Castle who is the chief legal advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, bunch of CEO's and a lot of journalist.  It was quite interesting to discuss foreign policy and international law with these individuals.  The best part of the whole deal was the free Starbucks coffee, free Krispy Kreme Donuts and Bagels, and the $100 lunch which of course was free.  -WOOHOO--
Last night I went out with some of my friends and ate dinner at this restraunt near West Point.  It was wonderful and I had a great time with my friends.  I had not enjoyed myself that much in so long.  Plenty of white wine and beer.  

Oh, the night prior to last night, I ate dinner with former Mayor Giuliani.  He showed up late, which was a wrong move on his part.  They had lots of free wine and man.  All of us cadets were so drunk and did they have to sit me with the assistant dean.  I definitely told him what I thought on certain courses.  --OOPS, PROBABLY NOT A SMART MOVE ON MY PART--  

I need a break though.  All week I have been babysitting this Uzbek cadet and I need a break from both him and school.  One positive thing from the conference besides the free food was one of the CEOs became interested in me.  He provided me with his contact information and it looks good for me.  I might be working for the United Arab Emirate corporation.  Lots of money to be made in this area and lots of travel as well.  However, most of the travel will be in the Middle East and I do not speak Arabic.  Well I better learn and soon.  

This is good enough for now.  I shall leave everyone to comment on my LJ, then go to another."

"event","Yesterday I took my Uzbekistan cadet to the PX and ran into the Canadian team staying here for the Sandhurst Competition.  So the first question was who is from TO and only one said that she was, but the others did like the idea that I had some concept of what TO stood for.  They all spoke the weak language of french, but I will not hold that against them.  Once we go talking, it occurred to me that I brought not one, but 3 Uzbek cadets and so I had to go on a hunt to find the other 2.  Well while I was hunting for the other 2, the one that was with me decided to leave.  Luckily for me the Canadians were watching and told me that he left.  I hate not speaking Russian.

1) If you could be one famous individual, who would that be from any time frame and do not worry about the sex?
ans: Napolean...I would luv to see his mass armies march over Europe.  Besides the military aspect, he brought liberal ideas to France and revived the arts and the need to preserve history.  Thanks to him, many of the current Egyptian artifacts that we have today were found by his armies.  Plus, he never quit, which was both good and bad for him.

2) If you could be any comic book hero or villian, who would you be and y?
ans: Of course Superman...man of steal, carried out good deeds, could fly, had unbelievable strength and one additional plus~X-ray vision :p!

3) If I gave you $1 million, what would you do with it?
ans: invest all of it after I bought myself an aston martin and put about $200,000 into a checking account for insurance purposes and to buy suits with.  Oh yeah, MONEY!!!

Well it is the end of the week and I still have lots of work to do.  --WHATEVER-- Punisher and Kill Bill, Volume 2 comes out in the movies.  I plan on seeing both.  Ok the Royal Navy Rugby game vs. Army Rugby is now.

After breakfast formation, I seriously just wanted to burn everything and take another trip anywhere but here. --WEST POINT SUCKS--  For example, I get back from breakfast and found my name on a list for missing a single item from my latrine locker.  Now if I had attended a regular college then maybe this would not be a problem.  Hold on thinking too much.  I might be shot for having socialistic ideas or something.  --U KNOW A DINNER WITH A HOT CHIC WOULD BE COOL RIGHT NOW--  Back on thought, really when did it become a crime to use something and forget to place it back in your own locker.  --WHATEVER--
  My friend from Cali is sad today.  She misses home.  Well I guess it is possible to miss San Fransico.  Never been there.  Speaking of San Fran, another one of my female friends is being hit on by a lesbian cop.  Now she is too nice of a person to inform this individual that she is not gay, but at the same time this cop is driving her crazy.  --MY FRIENDS HOT BY THE WAY...6FT BLONDE, W/ BLUE EYES--  So she came up with this plan, which consists of the two of us going out on a date with the cop.  She hopes that this date will throw the hint that she is not gay and not interested.  Ok I guess this is enough babbling for now.  Civil Engineering time  --I'M SUCH A GEEK SOMTIMES--"

"event","Wow...what a time out.  Life in Cali was great.  89 degree weather and freakin no rain.  But life must go on, back here at West Point its fu@% freezin.  No more fun in the sun and hot chics every time I turn around.  Instead lots of dudes with complexes that far exceed my understanding--want to be free again.  
  This homework stuff...not happening.  Whats up with this place? I think they've stuck bayonets up their asses and forget to remove them.  At least they have John Mayer here and so some cadets can forget about the harsh realities that life SUCKS(USCC on spell check).  
  I just want to talk to some attractive asiain chics right now...ok world, back to life...go do something good and save the world."

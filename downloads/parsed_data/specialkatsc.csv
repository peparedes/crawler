A lot has happened.

I went out with my mom Fri and Sat: Friday was AWEFUL Saturday was AWESOME. I met this great guy Jakub on Saturday and won him over by speaking Polish... he's from Poland. And handsome. And lives in Southy. He's in finance. I also spoke some German with his friend. He hasn't called back but it doesn't really matter- it just was a great boost for me... and all that stuff...

My first 4 days I cried at least 3 times a day... and couldn't even think about unpacking. I still havn't unpacked but I have *thought* about it...

Monday I called Verizon about my VERY outstanding bill... unresolved. I called Travelocity about the missed flight that I wanted a credit for since it wasn't my fault... successful (read: sort of)... my turn out helpful fall semester 

I talked to Matt... it was sort of a mess... and that was totally my fault- I just can't deal with shit if I'm not face to face with it. I can't fucking stand this e-mail disaster of ambiguity and everything that goes/has gone with it (read: oversimplified)... which leads me to: I think I'm going to CO... to visit. I tried to put up a fight but I really do want to go. I hope it works out... 

I went on a job hunt- which resulted in the JOB INTERVIEW I HAVE TOMORROW for Customer Service (in Russian) at the Call Center for Volt Services Group in Boston

I MET WITH SERGEY TODAY and it scared the holy hell out of me- in a good way. He sort of woke me up a little... I've really been worried about getting back, getting a job (read: life), ect... and about next year... do I want to write a thesis, should I really struggle to apply for the self designed minor (mid.-east studies), ect, ect... 

BUT... *he* wanted to know what my ""grand plan"" was: after Smith. I was a little embarrassed... I feel like a total flake... before I went to Russia I was the most put together, academically driven, whatever- and now I had to look at him and just laugh ""I don't know."" 

""Oh, well"" he replies and suggests to get some swanky internship in Russia after Smith for a year (name/program/everything drops of all the things I should look into) and then apply to Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, just the best he says otherwise it's not worth it... and of course that I should say the hell with Arabic and learn a Turic language because Arabic is useless to my ""portfolio"" whereas Azerbijani or Kazak... (elipses to save you from the rest of our head spinning lunch) also though... that I maybe shouldn't write a thesis... hmm.

ugh. So I'm still a little freaking out. And I don't know- I don't have a direction- unless you consider wanting to be in Russia a direction. 

But I'm better... and it will keep getting better. It's going to be ok. And that's ok."

"event","Walking the streets of Bremen
with my best friend
recounting the horrifying tale
of an October night at the skinhead bar
I looked around for passersby and
muttered the words, ""Hail Hitler""
This freedom comfortably revoked...

but in April I sat in my apartment
as the fascists went marching
though the streets of Vladimir
and carousing in the mall.
I would have laughed at the 
iorny if it didn't make me so sick...

The difference between freedom
for everyone and freedom for all
can only be felt by those truly without.

I'm now offically one of those people. It's discusting that Hitler's birthday is vehemently celebrated in a country possibly [read: definaly] hit hardest by his evil... I wrote that on Sat night when due to fascist activity and where in this city I live I literally couldn't leave my apartment after dusk. Today I was told by our residence director that all of the students on our program are now be watched by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs because they are deporting one of us for writing a reaserch paper on immigration in Russia. They will secretly be on our train to Sochi in two weeks... they are watching. And they want to deport us all. And if they don't succeed I guess it's not a problem because they can just leave us for the fascists. 

I have no rights. None. And there is sweet fuck all anyone can or would do about it. 

There is sooooo much more to be said about what on this topic has happened to us in the last month but I really just can't begin to deal with it right now. I just really want to tell someone to fuck off."

somehow preserve it's realness
(as if this way it could go on forever)

but now its near the end and 
I'm ready
to talk

I'm ready to stop hiding. Ready to exist again. And I guess that's good becuase I don't have a fucking choice. 
I have 5 weeks. 
And then I have to return to a life that has moved on 9 months without me and find my place. I'm not ready to leave but I don't know if that was ever going to happen so I guess its better this way. 

roomdraw is done, classes have been picked, and a job is being searched for... I'm ready to be productive in the American sense of the word although I am SCARED AS HELL of what America will be like after a year here. 

generally: I am ready to face loosing my life here and I am ready to try to pick up the scraps of what is still left waiting for me *but* I don't think that I can pretend on a case by case basis I am ready for this: ready to face my parents divorce, loose Scott, face Matt, move back to Middleboro, Pay all the bills I don't have money for and pay back all the money I borrowed...

possitivity and productivity... zzzzzeeeeeeeen... ???"

"event","You see, I hate the internet cafe.

One because it's NOT a cafe
and Two becuase I never get done what I want to get done here.

Things I wanted to write about:
Making friends in Germany and my visit with Lily!!!
Comming back: Moscow and Vladimir
Hanging out with Daniel
Metting with Marina
Dertermination to have a non-depressed semester
New independance at home
Decision NOT to write the term paper

I think we can say that I love Lily and that statement is entirely indicative of how my visit with her was: amazing. 
I got back to Russia and made it more than 24 hours and the entire metro system and the train to Vladimir and everything to and in the hotel and everything else without fucking a single thing up. I speak Russian- and not too poorly. I got back to Vladimir at 6pm and 90 seconds after unlocking the door and stepping into the apartment- we lost electricity. Yeah. Welcome back. (we got it back in about 3 hrs- not bad Russia- 3 hrs)
I got WAY drunker with Daniel than I wanted. And did not get my guitar back. Which I do want.
I spoke decent Russian for 2 and a half hours straight (we're talking not even a bathroom break) with Marina. I'd say that's a pretty good threshold for having been gone for 3 weeks.
I have created several check-lists and action plans to ensure a productive, happy, *quick*moving* semester including a list of one good or funny thing that happens everyday, ect. 1,2,3 channel Lily and will myself out of the depression of the Russian winter.
Nina's sister is unfortunatly still alive so she is gone A LOT and so: I have done my dishes twice, reheated food for myself, cleaned my underwear (by hand), and watched two movies on a tv channel we don't actually get by fucking with the tv. Yay me. (movies: Bring It On and The Replacements)
After several conversations with Lily and one with Jess I finally decided... and don't regret... not to write the term paper... yes, I am a hard core academic. But the long and the short of it is that my life here is not the same as my life at Smith... or in America. So I don't have to do it. So I won't. 

Now, I hope when I try to get my e-mail it will work since I posted because it wasn't working and I really need it to work. Really."

"event","I feel like I should say something about Germany... I feel like I should say somethings about the trip it took to get here... I feel like there are some things I want to keep to my self- put them in a air tight container and only open it to peer in when I get to Russia and travel becomes life again. 

Trip: 
My flight from Boston to NY- JFK was delayed and I had to get on another flight- and leave my luggage in hopes that it was going to be where I was when this all ended. I left Boston feeling sooo rediculous- I sobbed. It was stupid but I literally couldn't help it- I tried to stop it. Everyone was pretty supportive of the crying though so I think it was ok.
I got to JFK and that flight (to London HR) was also delayed... 3 and a half hours!!! Which means that I spent almost 7 hours in JFK before I finally got on the plane and left. First 3 hell- last 3 bliss. I stood at check in for 2 hours with seemingly every person of indian decent (the flight was with air india) in the greater NYC area, and at one point the airport's fire alarm went off and everyone was like, ""I've been here for over an hour- I don't car if the building burns around me- I'm not moving."" People were fighting over seats- in Hindi HAHAA. At one point I looked around me and I felt like a tsunami refugee. Seriously rediculous. But after all of that I met Dominican boy. 
I then crossed London to the next airport and slept there for 4 hours until my next flight- shockingly, also delayed. HAHAHAHAHA. 
Through all the planes and security I successfully help on to my bottle of cough syrup which I sort of couldn't believe.... security smerity. I win. 

Germany:
Only been here a day so I don't really have anything great to say about it yet- but I'll let you know.

Well, that's all I can really get to right now because I need to bathe. But I'll certainly have some things to say about Germany, hanging out with Lily's Brit friends... and Lily of course, duh. Yay vacation!!! And seeing Jess soon!!! Double yay!"

I just keep reminding myself: I'm still on vacation... for three weeks!... and I'm not *immediatly* going back to Russia... and I DO want to go back [read: eventually...] 

I'm just never ready in this damn country... I'm always procrastinating and late... somehow always shocked when the deadline punches me in the face with a friendly reminder of your time is very nearly up... I think somehow procrastinating will push the deadline further away and yet of course I *know* this is not true. Ugh. 

However, I was able to reply to someone this evening on the phone: ""I love you too."" And that someone wasn't my mom. 

Also, I feel like my life is astetically pleasing... I don't know how this is... I just feel that way.

I wish I could see the ocean one more time before I am on a plane... but alas, that will not happen to me tomorrow.

Somehow I also feel like it's important to tell you all that I found a Hootie and the Blowfish cd this evening and decided I could not leave without ripping it to my computer. So I did."

sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else

(ps- someone please know that's a Dave reference)

There are a lot of things I want to say and a lot of them I'm not sure make any sense outside of my head.  This break has perhaps been [almost] as shaping (wrong word but best in the English language I could think of) as my entire last semester: equally as awaited, painful, difficult, and finally rewarding and affirming.  

I suppose where I want to start is at the end- the result- what makes all the labor worth while; and maybe after I will feel like talking about what it took to get here.  

I finally feel ok with what I'm doing. ""Ok"" a term I use to steer away from a corny phrase like, ""at peace.""  It's a little like indifference only I acctually DO give a shit about it all- A LOT.  I finally feel like an adult- a real one- not just someone who takes reponcibiltiy because no one else will, or goes to college and pays bills, or is old enough to drink- like I've really got it together- got a life.  Two things I always had but in the way I do now.  Maybe it's just a feeling- maybe I can't explain it.  And I sort of feel like I have had it this way for a while and just didn't see it- but I also feel like that can't be true becuase I think it has a lot to do with things about me that have changed since I left. Maybe I've just been ready for it and waiting for it to be possible. 

Again, all speculatory.  

I took a chance on love- something I DON'T do.  Unfortunatly, it was agreed that it can't work out.  I'm not going to say I was entirely graceful about it- but no one expects that.  What I can say is I am so happy that we are still the friends we were before this vacation. (God damn it, I wish you all knew Russian because there are better words than happy that I want to use...) And what's more- it was honest- all of it- honest, sincere, wonderful.  And in retrospect I would not take one thing back.  Before this break I would have wished to God that I wasn't doing what I am doing- that the situation was different so that things could work out- that I was in a different place in my life- but I don't feel that way.  We all just doing what we're supposed to do.  Things are just the way they're supposed to be.  

Jay asked me to call him.  I did not.  I will not.  And for perhaps the first time- I have no desire to- I have no interest in talking to him.  Even in moments of, well, I suppose for lack of better term weakness, situations or times when I would have fallen back on an easy (read: bad) habbit like that- I DIDN'T. 

I went into Papa Ginos and realized I didn't want to tell them about all the AWESOME shit I'm doing becuase I don't need to flaunt it in their faces becuase I don't give a shit what they think about me.  I don't have anything to prove to them.  And to me, my life is just my life- I mean, this is all just what I do- it's normal.  There sort of just isn't anything to say about personal normality.  

I'm tired and also not willing to lie and say I will finish this later becuase I'm sure I probably will not.  So, goodnight. :*"

First I didn't know what the hell was going on ie: what day or time it was, what country I was in, what language I needed to speak (which wasn't helped either by the hospitol christmas party I went to DIRECTLY after leaving the airport where I spoke sort of ok Russian with two of my mom's work friends or by the fact that everyone wants to hear me speak Russian even though they seriously haven't a damn clue what I'm saying) 

Then I FREAKED out because I realized I was in America and how different that is from where I've been for the last four months. Yay for reverse culture shock. They worned us about it but I didn't actually think I would freak out like that. 

AND NOW, and by now I mean yesterday, I freaked out because I was homesick- for Russia. Mostly just for Nina because I worry about her but really I miss RUSSIA and all the people I know there- American and Russian. I also feel pretty bad that I havn't called Nina yet and I was sort of supposed to call her as soon as I could, like, maybe, Thur. And now it is Wed. 

I also have a little head cold thingy which is making me sad- and by that I mean making me go through a box of tissues in a day and a half. Boo to that. However, I am not blowing my nose in newspaper (that's how we roll in Russia) therefore I am not THAT sad. 

Overall America is the shit. I'm eating real cheese and peanutbutter and drinking milk and watching tv I enjoy and understand 100% and speaking in English and not getting fustrated and showering with real soap and a real shower... I've seen Jen and Gary and Tina and everyone and my family and today I will see Matt and Sara and Bri say they are comming to visit me this weekend.

I'm seriously not fantasic at dealing with death... much less in this situation. 

Moving on. 

Yeah, well... terrible weekend just waiting for a week and a half to go by so I can go home BUT NOW I am doing things like going to the baynnya... actually relaxing, the movies... promises also to be shocking depressing, taking tests... many, and doing a lot of ""lasts"" until I get back for next semester like, last phone call with mom, last hours of kindergarden, last meeting with tutor, last excursion... and it's nice. Nice to wraping things up, to feel like I might be missed a little and I might miss a little before I return, to feel acomplishment without the bitterness of the final goodbye, I don't know... maybe I'm just happy becuase I finally feel like Christmas is on it's way and soon I will be able to enjoy all that has to offer."

"event","Well, let's start with yesterday becuase it was a far supirior day:

on Oct. 30th:
I was warm- all day
spoke good- unprovoked- Russian on several occasons
was told by one of my teachers that I looked so good I must have fallen in love
took pictures of beautiful snow
didn't get fustrated
was told by my tutor she was sure before I left Russia I would marry a Russian and have 5 kids
made an executive phone call with Zena Sergeyevna (Jason's hozyaika, about today)
was creepily harrassed/admired by our drunk neighbor in our apartment
was told that I have an authentic Russian soul

...and all manner of other interesting things...

today however:
I got up at the ass crack of dawn
took three busses which eventually led me out of Vladimir
walked a mile in below 0 degrees
finally got to the *sketchtastic* clinic
was attacked by a nurse in a far less than sanitary situation where she drew my blood
by stabing me as hard as she could in the finger with what appeared to be a sewing needle
and squeezing an entire vile of blood from the wound
waited for all the other full year students to have it done
4 hours later returned to school
had mid-term evaluations with my grammar and speech teachers
had a bit of class
had a mid-term evaluation with my RD

I cannot describe this ""clinic"". They put our viles of blood with our paperwork in old vegetable cans, the reason I know they were vegetable cans is that the lables were still on them- each person's vile in its own can. The building is far past decrepid and is surrounded by a mixture of ghost city and siberian ghetto, which you have to wak through to get there. On the way we also past some rather large dogs who were rummaging through the dumpsters and garbage all over the street. Inside the clinc we stood in a line with the sickest looking people I've ever seen in my life. One woman was actually bleeding from her arm and was holding a rag to it. They looked like they were dying- because they were for the most part. But then we convinced them to ""express"" our tests at which point we had to stand outside for a few hours- below 0 -and go in one by one.

It was terrifiying. And now, if I didn't have HIV, I've surely got it now. Thanks Russia.

Up side, getting good grades so far and apparently have made fantastic progress. ...And they really enjoy my homework. Etc."

"event","I have a lot of other things I'm supposed to be doing but I feel like we all need to take a moment to read about St. Petersburg:
I suppose we can start with things aquired:

*haricut- Ruski bangs... the ""sideways bangs"" sort of like those emo things that go across your forhead and sort of tuck behind your ear. they're pretty hot. not gonna lie.

balalika- small triangular guitar with only three strings. now all I have to do is learn how to play it. 

several *rediculously illegal* pirated, 50ruble, DVDs. ot-fuking-leechna (oh, yeah... you probably don't get that... umm... tran: a-fucking-mazing) so, you pay =2dollars for 9-14 films on one double sided disc of greatness... I got one of Soviet comedies, one Oleg Menshikov, and several hilarious others.

Ruski pop- including but absolutely not limited to TaTu. also pretty pirited. One CD is Sergey Lazarev who was on trans= dancing on ice, this fucking awesome show I watch every Sun night where a famous olympic skater is pared with a famous non-skater and they get judged on their routines. Anyway, great Ruski trashy hilarious pop

night life:

one night we went to this dancing bar called Money Honey... which was pretty great. It was live bands, music was like, Elvis Presly and stuff like that, great atmosphere AND: the only gentlman in Russia... he asked me to dance to a slow song, we danced and at the end he kissed each of my hands and asked to walk me back to my table... later he came up to our table and in front of everyone said how much he enjoyed my company, ect. and kissed my hand again tanked me and said goodbye. I was sooo red... the boy from our group sitting next to me Matt asked me if I was flattered and said that that ""NEVER"" happens in Russia and that I must have been really special.

next time I went out not so great: I was asked by some of our guys and the cook from our hostel to go out and play some pool... after quite a bit of convincing I went. Explaination needed: the cook is an immigrant from Uzbekistan, and every morning I went in for breakfast he would like hold my hands which were on the counter, or pinch my cheaks or whatever... well, you know that's all small stuff you can sort of just overlook. but after a few bottles of vodka with all his Uzbek friends who we all met-his intentions became very clear. By the end of the night I was stuck in what I affectionatly call the ""Russian grip"" in the entrance hall of the hostel unable to get away. I was pushing very hard on his chest and you'd think that was a clear sign that I don't want to kiss you but, there I was. I did speak some amazing Russian though. All things considered all I really had to deal with was some trashy neck kissing and boob grabing at the bar and then the hallway thing for half an hour until I lost my patients and yelled at him. He couldn't understand why I did tht. He asked me why I was being an evil girl and said I was acting like Godzilla. I guess that's the price you pay for not being allowed to pay ofr anything at the bar. Which I tried to do and was absolutely refused. Like I siad tho, I spoke some amazing Russian.

I did a lot of cultured things in St. Pete also:

Ballet- OMG soooo goooood. and all the girls got all dressed up. I wore a really hot black dress... the one I got hand-me-down from Alex... all the boys in my group at intermission when we went out to smoke were like ""oh my god, you look so hot"" ""seriously, it's distracting"" ect.ect. and the ballet was amazing. A-mazing. 

I also took a personal excusion to the Freud Museum of Dreams. It was pretty Freudian to say the least.

Met with prof. Mikeshin: ps if anyone who actually knows who that is is reading this he says hello. that was really wonderful. He is going to write me an offically invitiation for next semester for me to go for a week and like tour the universities there... sit in on classses and stuff. He also wants me to write something- like compiling all of my impressions and all of my thoughts about Russia, and living here, and comparissons between Am. and like about history and stuff. I really would like to but I don't really know how I could make it like accademically sound so I could like get credit for it or something...

Anyway, tht be all for now."

"event","I had a bad week. I HORRIBLY TERRIBLY RECHID week.

It started in Yaroslavl when I got sick- of the stomach persuasion- and was rooming with one of my teachers in the hotel=

FIRST RUSSIAN HOME REMEDY=

DRINK 2.5L OF HOT WATER AND BOTH FORCIBLY AND UNCONTROLABLY VOMIT. RINCE. REPEAT. *ALL IN RUSSIAN* That's right. My Russian teacher explained to me in Russian how to properly gag myself and then watched me pucke my guts out. Twice. That's pretty exhausting work, let me tell you. Best workout I've had in this counrty.

This week I also:

Was told by my RD (with the rest of the students) that we are waisting our time and money. And that from now on the language pledge is not only fully in effect but that there will be serious consiquences for non-compliance. And then I talked to him after our YOU-GUYS-SUCK meeting (about how fucking hard I *am* actually trying... to no avail)... and cried in front of him. Good move Kendra, really stellar.

Lost my house key (this is actually a *much* bigger problem than it is in the states)

And many other assorted mishaps. And the inability to get internet for a week, or call the US.

Which concluded today with my *complete* inability to understand ANYTHING that was happening in grammar class at which point, I cried. In class. Oh, I hate myself for that move. I didn't make a scene or anything I just had had enough. Fucking enough. (((btw my RD just called my cell phone... mmmm.... *love* me that language pledge))) Anyway, everything worked out ok when I talked to my teacher after class. I told her about this week and not understanding the material and she was really encouraging. WOW. Some FUCKING ENCOURAGEMENT *IN*RUSSIA*! Who knew?!

BUT THEN:

After class I was lent a diskman so I could listen to my Foo Fighters (double disk- In Your Honor- if you're curious) which won't work on my computer without internet... and then I came here (internet cafe) and read my e-mails. And there was one from Matt. And one from Jay. Let me type it again to be sure you get this: And one from Jay. I can't tell you how I feel about this but I *can* tell you that it's pretty fucking wierd that I finally get this listen to this cd and I get an e-mail from him same day. And also that there was one from Matt and then him one the same day. ""These damn coincidences are making me sick to my stomach"" (quote from V for Vendeta) I also got a card from Barry in the mail. And I am due to open one of Aunt Kathy's cards tomorrow. 

This is all just what I need. A reminder that there are people on this planet- albeit on the other side- who want me to do well and care about me and believe I can and will do well. A little reminder of where I came from and why I'm here. 

And now I feel ready to kick this language's ass!!! No. Not just this language. Vladimir, I'm ready to kick this city's ass."

This week has been wonderful. I finally feel like a real person again, I go to school, I went to a rock concert (a bigger version of th ehard core shows I went to in high school), aerobics (mostly because it's funny and one of the host mom's goes), I talked to a Russian boy while I waited for this computer and we understood eachother... I'm meeting people who actually live here and I'm starting to explore the city. I understand what is going on in class and at home finally. I get to travel free of charge pretty much every weekend and take crap loads of pictures. I got over the home sickness, real sickness (which I bought antibiotics for in the apteka without a perscription), and culture shock. Sometimes I forget that my life plays in Russian now and when someone talks I don't know why it's not english that I hear and then I wonder why I understand anyway... although a lot of the time I still don't understand. but now that mostly it just makes me laugh and not get fustrated. I'm glad to hear everything is good at home... as much as I love everything here I can't wait for christmas to see you all. and the cats... didn't consider how much I would miss a nice clean animal. :) Talk to you soon!

this was to my grandmother so it' a little subdued but the important thing is my life in Russia officially kicks ass."

Last night while doing the 4 hours of homework that I didn't understand I had a little freak out: homesickness and culture shock have offically set in.

I want some fucking scolloped potatoes. I want to be able to SIT on a fucking toilet seat to pee. I want a shower. With hot water. To wash my hair properly. And wash more on my body than my face, armpits, and bits and pieces. I want to be warm. When I sleep. Or when I'm awake. I'll take either. I want to watch some fucking tv. I want my family. I want my friends. No amount of Smith feminism or badassness is going to make me feel like I can do this. Because I don't. I want for one fucking second to feel less than at least a little sick. I want a vaccum cleaner to vaccum the dusty, smelly, probably a little moldy carpet on my floor. Or the one on my wall. Either would be nice. I want to be able to buy a fucking cell phone without a Russian and all of my documents. I want to eat when I want and not when someone says they're ready for me to eat. I wanto be able to boil my own water for coco which I cannot do because if the stove is not lit properly there is risk of explosion. This is a device us Americans like to call the dragon. I want there to be a word in the dictionary for fustrated so I can tell my host babushka that I can't handle talking to her sometimes. Or irritated. Either word would do. And as I saw in my dictionary last night apparently neither exist. When I put something down in my room I want it to stay there. I am sick of looking for shit I put away that has convieniently been put away somewhere else sense I left for school. When I get home I don't want to change immediatly into my pajamas. I don't want to wear slippers everysecond either. I want to walk down my street alone. I want to use my computer for internet. I want a happy medium between listening so hard my ears fall off to understand everything and sitting alone in silence. I want to cross the street without having to take my life into my hands. I want there to not be literally moldy food sitting next to my plate on the table. I want to pee in a toilet that is not also used for dumping all the things you don't want to put in the only garbage bucket in the house. And I would like if people flushed it. Ever.

Ok, seriously, I'm done. Done complaining. Today I cried at the end of my last class to my teacher... she was actually great about it. So then I left had a smoke and got over it all. 

In 24hours everything will be amazingly better: I will have a motherfucking cell phone, I will be packing for a long weekend in Moscow, I will not have school until Mon. That will be the life. I can handle this. Come on Russia- bring. it. on.

Also, I feel like people in America should know that last Thur. I was kicked out of the first club in Russia I ever went to. With this other American Andrew... and then this other American Andrew was also kicked out. Lets just say vodka is cheap. We went to the club on Sat. and I stayed the whole night. Yeah. Maybe I'll actually post about that sometime. It was all pretty fucking fantastic."

I feel aweful. I knew I was probably going to be a mess my last week but this is a messy mess and it may only get worse.

I keep crying and I'm not scared or sad so I can't really pin point what that is and I just don't feel good, like headaches and a whole fucking lot of laziness... like the kind that makes you feel worse every second so that you can't pull yourself out of it. I feel like even though I'm trying, and have generally been successful, to be nice to everyone I feel like I'm incapable of feeling anything good about anything... like I'm only being nice because I have to and I really just want to tell everyone off. Ugh.

Angst. Stupid, rediculous angst.

Jay texted me: ...I just wanted to let you know one last time what you meant to me. Weather you know it or not, you have taught me so much about life and the time we spent together was some of the best times of my life. Our relationship has been a rocky one, but I will treasure it always, something I will always treasure in my heart until the dady I die, you truely were like a piece of a star that fell from heaven... Thank you.

Also, my aunt has cancer. Apparently it's *really* NOT too bad but she has to have a historectomy. Cool. That's some fucking terrific news.

My mom is still drinking but she's trying to make everything right so I've just been letting her do it and I feel guilty for not stoping her but I just can't stand to have things all fucked up. Not now. It really makes me sad: how hard she's trying to make it all ok. Everything is just falling apart and I wish that she didn't have to fake it or just do what she's doing... And apparently Chris is a fucked up again and I believe it. and that sucks.

Everyone (Jeremy and my nana just fucking everyone) is just up set about this week and me leaving and it just sucks. And all I want to do is lay in bad alone and cry.

And also, another one of my retarded wisdom teeth is trying to retard itself out of my gums. So I'm teething at age 20 and will most likely continue to teeth in Russia... hahaha a which point I will also get my period... maybe comparativly this week won't be that bad. Ugh."

"event","Kendra, the piece you wrote surprised and impressed me.  It is eloquent, thoughtful, insightful, and moving.  Now I wish I'd asked you to write something sooner because it shows you in ways that I wouldn't know otherwise.  Thank you for your participation in our Mondays.  Best wishes as you go off to Moscow and beyond.  You can call on us if there's any way we can help (especially in St. Petersburg).  We will be contacting people at Smith next month.  HS

I wanted to start with that. Which is one of the reasons that today was so great. One of the reasons that I am so filled with full. Full and happy. Full with happy. The above copy and pasted e-mail was my Monday boss' responce to the personal statement I wrote for him on our last Monday (which was this last Monday, duh.).

Other reasons for incredibly wonderful day include, work: going to work today at 12:30 and getting away with it; helping Igor, one of the immigrants who comes to the center, write out all of his checks to pay his bills explaining how to do everything and talking (in Russian, duh.) with him with no problem and being understood easily for two hours; watching a really good Russian movie with my favorite actor Oleg Menshikov in it; etc.

after work: getting to mom's work just barely in time and on the way up the hill to the entrance running into Felix her *wonderful* work friend who gave me a DVD with Soviet cartoons on it and giving him the copy of ""Piter FM"" that I got *highly* pirated from my internship with a note that he read a bit of and assured me it was completely understandable. Our conversation was just wonderful- everything about it. His demenor was just... it was just what it was- . It breaks my heart that he is married to such a wonderful woman (who also works there) because it is just so perfect and I would seriously fall in love with this man if he wasn't so utterly off the market. He is just to kind I guess when you get right down to it. And he has this cute accent as he is from Latvia (but speaks Russian natively courtesy of the USSR).

I got home and bought some new pants as I officialy only had 4 pairs of pants to my name that didn't have a *huge* rip in the ass. Huge. Then, I recieved an e-mail saying simply: ""Love you"". I think that last one speaks for itself. Really. I replied: ""love you back"". I miss the refreshing feeling of saying things and meaning every word. I have done it only twice in probably the past week. Every word. Both occasions before you: the personal statement and this e-mail. 

It took a whole three months but I finaly feel like I have made an impact in/with my work. I feel like I'm finaly getting what has been comming to me (having worked so much harder than the other interns... and even my bosses on so many occasions, etc.) I also recieved a letter today at the center from the Children of Chernobly Project whom I interpreted for those three times. No one else at the center got a letter (again not even my boss). They sent me a letter to thank me for everything that I had done for them and wanted me to know what an impact it made. The last sentence said that I was making the world a better place one child at a time and while that's *discustingly* corny I think it might be true.

Dear August 8th, thank you for being so delicious. Yours, Kendra"

The only thing that *is* upsetting is that I actaully feel like I'm going to DIE. And by that I mean death is the only thing I can think would cause this range of horrible symptoms. I keep getting these terrible waves of something is going to come out of both ends rather violently or else I'm going to faint or maybe all three, I'm getting migranes, I feel like I can't breath and my heart is racing, I feel weak/woozy, I'm not sleeping well and I have no appitite even when my stomach is screaming I'm really fucking empty. Oh, and I have my period. Overall, it's like death. I think I'm going to see someone about this because it's been 3 days of intense symptoms and 5 overall that I've not been feeling right.

Jeremy and I went to Six Flags yesterday (in spite of said illness) and on the MassPike, at 85 miles an hour, I blew the front passenger side tire. COOL. I was in the middle lane with an 18 wheeler in the lane I really needed to get into which really added to the fun of speeding along with 3 tires. Luckily Jeremy has AAA so at least there was that. And once we finaly fucking got there it was really fun. We got a bunch of hilarious pictures with the Roadrunner, Willie Cyote, Matvin the Martian, and Scooby Do. And it was really cheap thanks to AAA for the second time in one day. If my car gets any more pathetic it will be completely undriveable.

I'm not speaking to my mom, I guess. If it were up to me I don't even think I would be staying here... but it sort of isn't. She kicked me out like a shitload of times for pretty much just hiccuping in her direction, so I left... for good, and then went back to try and solve the problem the adult way, but of course she didn't want any part of that so she kicked me out again, so I wrote her a letter telling her exactly what I thought of her- again in a pretty mature way- and Chris pretty much told me it was time to come back and she has since not spoken to me or even been in the same room as me... which means that I would probably just be happier somewhere else, but as I say: not really up to me. 

Main points of said letter include: I'm sick of forceing you to care about my life/me especialy since you are so explicit about your huge disinterest, I can't stand to watch you drink your life away and blame it on everyone else, Jeremy and I are exceptional people and you treat us like delinquents, you never take responciblilty or face reprcussions to your actions, etc, etc. To which she while I was gone drank the vodka that I still had left over from my trip last January that I was storing in the freezer. Good job proving me wrong. I'm just sort of so sick of this shit that I'm not really phased by it or up set about it- it's stupid that this is so common place that I don't care. 

In any case, I only have 4 days left of this stupid job!!! And there are 4 of the most slack filled days ever. There are only me and one other girl left and we already decided that on Tue we will come in at 12 have a nice long lunch and chit-chat since our boss informed us she will not be in until 2:30-3... Wed we watch a film and will probably leave soon after that, Mon we will just be hanging around the Tang Center and saying goodbye to Harris and Svetlana, Thur we just hang around the Center and say goodbye to everyone there and one of those days I will go to Eduard's in Malden slack off some more and say goodbye there- or perhaps, if I call him, I can convince him to come to the center one of those days and say goodbye to me since I won't *really* have time to work with him with all the travel time having to go to the center first and all..."

I really am sick of my job and all the people involved in it... no one EVER shows up on time- not even my BOSS- and it's all just a big fucking waist of my time THAT IS COSTING ME MONEY. That's right: I have to pay to get to work so I can sit here and post on my fucking livejournal while I wait for my stupid boss and collegues to show up so that we can do *nothing* until I pay to go home.

Ok, I'm done complaining about that.

I am however, wearing a dress. A dress. It's nice and cute and white. 

I am thinking about trying to figure out my travel plans for break at least a little... but it's SO far from now it's sort of impossible... but it will be difficult to figure it out in Russia when it gets closer to the time because communication with the outside world- which my travel plans sort of invlove since I will be mainly visiting people- will be slim to none. Plus, in order to get out of Russia for my 6 week break I need to apply for a seperate visa and I don't know how involoved that visa will be, or how long it will take to get it, or really anything except that I have to have one. Anyway, I think I at least know all the stops I will make: Finland, St. Petersburg, USA, London, Germany, Lithuania, and maybe some wierd place or other en route... 

I think it's just a matter of the order of things and all the other people involved. And I am under the impression that people think they might want to come and visit me which complicates things because I think it's pretty [lesser word meaning frowned upon] for that to happen during the semester. I also feel like I would rather host people somewhere like St. Petersburg and not so much in Vladimir... but as I've never been I guess I don't actually have any idea what I'm talking about.

I've also been feeling sort of under the weather. I don't like this ""average cold"" thing happening in the summer, it doesn't make sense... you get colds in the winter not when it's 100 degrees out. But all in all, meh. Maybe I'll read some Harry Potter while I continue to wait... for nothing."

"event","I am experiencing a lot of emotional trauma that I can't really describe. It's something to do with moving to Russia. And by that I mean it's ALL to do with moving to Russia and it's confusing and really multi-facited (I *know* I couldn't have spelled that right). And everytime I try to write about it I decide I can't.

So here is a VERY simplified list of what's going on inside:

I havn't been REALISTIC about this until recently so all the time I've spent thinking about this has been a HUGE fucking waist of essentially every other minute since sophomore year in high school. And as a result of both 1. how much time I've spent thinking about it and 2. how I've been thinking about it (unrealisticly if you missed that) everyone around me pretty much thinks this trip is just like a weeks vacation in Warsaw: meaning essentially no big fucking deal. WHICH IS UNTRUE. 

I'm scared (pretty self expainatory). And I'm angry (because such a *wonderful* experience is totaly TAINTED by having to do it *completely* alone). And I'm excited (pretty self explainatory). And it's TOO hard to feel like all of that about the same thing at the same time. 

Why can't I just do the easy thing and go to Smith for my junior year and hang out with my friends and all the professors I already know and everything that goes with that?!?!?! (and that was in NO WAY meant to be offensive... I realize now that could be taken in a mean way)

And the thing is, is that all of my anxieties have HUGE and legitimate arguements against why I should be freaking out. I mean really, I won't die from this. And I will make new friends- and by new I mean more- and EVERYTHING will be fine. My host family won't starve me. I will understand what is going on. I will ajust. But NONE of this can quell my aprehension. 

I don't like that I had to say goodbye to some of the best people I know fucking 3 months before I moved away for another fucking 10 (without counting the consecutive 3 months when I move back that I STILL won't see them). I don't like that I can't even make a phone call to my family when I just can't take anymore and need to hear someone and understand what the fuck they're saying without having to wrench my brains out. 

I feel like I'm ALWAYS forgetting something now. I feel like I'm going to forget shit going to Russia... important shit, unimportant shit, everything. I feel like I'm going to forget to say goodbye to people before I go. Everyday I wake up and think of 5 more things 'I need to remember to get to'. Then I think of 5 more and the first 5 are gone until they pop into my head some other day.

Ok so that wasn't exactly the bulleted list I thought I would produce but whatever. I needed to just get that out. So there it is: the tip of the iceburg."

Saturday night we ended up going to this party... a friend of a friend type of invitation. It started out pretty chill and cool. Theeennnnn I jumped into the pool in my underwear. Well, I didn't really jump... I was (without much convincing) talked into going in with a boy from Ireland. Pretty god damn cute- huge amounts of Irish charm- and the accent- pretty much to die for. I was wearing jeans and a tank top so I couldn't go in like that. He wanted to throw me in clothed but he politly waited until I had striped down to my undies and then put me over his shoulder and jumped in. 

We proceeded to goof around in the pool dunking each other and such inevitably making out and spending the rest of the night rolling around in the grass and the like together until we left at 3. Sara took the other boys from Ireland to Wal-Mart because they didn't know what the hell it was or what the fuss was about (personally I don't either...) and she kindly left me and Gary- yeah, that's his name... wierd huh- anyway she lefy us at the house the party was at and came to get me after. 

I love my friendship with Sara: it's just chill. No one is getting bent out of shape over dumb shit... I know quite a few people who would have been pissed if they took someone to a party and they ended up macking it with someone and that's dumb... but one the other hand I think Sara found herself a pretty good time too. ;)

A-fucking-mazing. He was so sweet- and refreshing. And the greatest part is that none of it was tainted by rash/regretable actions- although I would have *loved* to sleep with him, or stay the night at least and see Sara in the morning it just wasn't possible (no condom, can't stay at a party you're friend takes you to where *she* hardly knows anyone, etc). I guess it was just incredible to *want* to have sex with someone again. Yay, I'm not a hag! Normal men are attracted to me! I can get involved with someone my own age! 

We exchanged numbers and he's in New Rochell still for a bit... so I guess we'll see... He was so wonderful. He didn't want me to leave and he kept pleading with me to stay saying things like ""my chest needs someone"" after I had been laying with him on a couch with my head on his chest. It was just so cute- and genuinly nice, spontanious, and innocent.

Anyway, my lovely collegues have arrived so PEACE!"

First there was a huge and long drawn out thunderstorm that wouldn't let me sleep... and then I was attacked by a zealous mosquito who left more than a dozen dime sized welts on me... and then my brother came home and talked on his cell phone (in the other room but *completely* audiable) for hours. All in the middle of the night. 

Today shows promise but in a vague way. At least I can be sure that lunch will be a good time. Mmmmm... delicious Russian meat perogi(ish) things from the Chinese restaurant next door...

This office is hot as hell. It's offical. It's been confirmed that the *exact* temperature of this room is equal to that of hell."

I thought of a few other people when I came across these but I think that *everyone* can take something from them.

I am SO OVERWHELMED that really simple daily tasks have become impossible to handle. I have sooo much work to do before this internship ends and still so much shit to do before I can go away and I just can't do it. 

This is all just made so much worse by the atmosphere of my current surroundings- which needless to say is not only a very unproductive and non proactive atmosphere but is also loaded with suspicion and anger and probably also guilt.

Also, everything makes me want to cry. I feel like I already want to cry about leaving and it's not happening yet. I want to cry about being so happy about doing this and about being so sad that I have to do it alone. EVERYTHING makes me want to cry. All the time.

On the cute side of things: We got a kitten. Who remains still unnamed. But is soo cute and tiny and black and white and meows a lot. And who this morning peed on my bed. Well, can't be cute all the time, right? He really likes to attack things that don't move. Examples of this include: the couch cushions, pillows, unworn shoes, and pants when you're unsuspectingly sitting and watching TV. He also eats a lot. A lot. 

I also have taken a stand: I hung out with Jay on Thursday night and while I ended up sleeping there (because it was so late) we didn't even kiss. On Friday night I hung out with Matt (the one who came to Smith that aweful weekend) and although I slept there (because it was so far away) again, nothing happened. Yay me. 

Well, I only have 43 days left, so I should try to DO SOMETHING. Now."

A boy that I coincidentally was just thinking about within this past week. Since I am lazy I will let a previous IM conversation tell the story:

me: hmm... well, he was an '02 but I was friends with him really only freshman year... but we really got along
friend: cool cool
me: and I saw him today and it was pretty sweet
me: he was like 'it is you, I thought I saw you eariler'
friend: lol
friend: awesome
me: and then he made a joke about studying 'a-broad' that I didn't get at first and I felt stupid...
me: and then he walked me to my train
friend: sounds romantic
me: hahaha, it was kind of
me: but I was a dumbass and didn't ask him for his number or anything
friend: lol
me: perhaps tomorrow I will stop kicking myself in the ass enough to laugh about it... :(
friend: lol

This is clearly a very sonopsized version of what happened (we actually talked for 5-10 minutes including the walk to the train door... at which point there was the part that I was very akward...) but I literally got on the train, sat down, and giggled uncontrolably- at times out right cracking up- for a significant portion of the ride... I wasn't laughing at any particular thing, I was just laughing. Needless to say, there were people looking at me like I was crazy. 

I would say that puts 15 minutes of my day today at blissful. And I don't know why... it was *that* good I mean. 

I also found... or really just re-discovered this past week, this cd that another boy in high school made for me... and I truely love this cd. It was really one of the most sincere things... it's just... this is the track list: (fyi: band, song)

The title of the first of my vacation e-mails from said boss was 'The 4th of July is not a holiday in Russia'  Thank you Harris, I'm well aware of that. Apparently he really DID expect us all to work on our vacations because yesterday I recieved another (about the 10th) vacation e-mail letting us know that he would like progress reports at 10am tomorrow when we meet.

This will be difficult to prepare as I have no progress in the last 10 days to report. I think I am actually going to make this worse and ignor the problem until I start my commute tomorrow morning. Heck, I can do a weeks worth of work on an hour train ride, right? Riiiight.

In other news: I have turned into the asshole in the Jay situation as I have taken a lot of very good advice from people and decided to GET OUT OF THE HOUSE but now he's pissed because I just havn't had time to get into it with him... and by that I mean I havn't talked to him AT ALL in 10 days and he wants to know what the fuck is going on. Perhaps I should just call him and tell him that I am the asshole he's bassicaly accusing me of being.

The last text I recieved said 'If you don't want to talk to me again why don't you just tell me? Is this payback or something? This is exactly why I did not want to get involved with you again. I just want a reason.'

Well, needless to say, I was a little blown away by this. I really didn't do any of this on purpose. Thing is, is that there is no way to be rational or logical and explain anything to him because he only hears what he wants... so I don't really know what to do asside from just do nothing... but really I'm just not mean enough- I at least owe him a reason- but what the fuck would I say 'I'm too good for you' 'the only reason I started talking to you again was because I was pissed off at my crazy family and I was being selfish'.

Other than that, not much going on.

My mom left last night and has yet to return per suspicion that Chris is getting high again. This is clearly a reason to run away and leave Jeremy and I here... not that I wanted to leave with her but the point is this was not the right course of action. Once again she doesn't have regard or compassion for anyone else in the situation but herself.

How can I complain when, for once, or for first (?), she took Jake with her, which, in hindsight, gives her the ability to not return for as long as she presumably wants... (It occurs to me now that there is a weird sense of abandonment that accompanies this situation- but in a strange way)

I don't know what to do or think about this entire ""episode"" and it complicates things that I don't know what to do in a seemingly ""normal"" circumstance with them (my parents) because of hurt feelings on account of them treating me like SHIT. So there it is.

Jeremy on the other hand is being nothing short of the largest asshole on this side of anything, and as I am the only one left here, I am the one to get all his I'm-clearly-up-set-about-something-entirely-different-than-what-I'm-screaming-at-you-about (being the large elephant in room) and we have upped the anty (sp?) from the frequent you're a fucking bitch etc, etc, to a cunt on several of these occasions. As well as outright sneak-attacking me in arguments I had no idea were actually happening. Thank you very much.

Of course all of this had to start within the first two days of my 10 day vacation. Of course. I seriously refuse to be the glue in these situations anymore. I quit. And if it all falls apart well, then it will finaly just look the way it always has been.

If there is any chance that anyone feels in anyway compelled to stop me from wanting to kill myself (what I want to say is killing myself- but I feel like that's just too emo) this week, and you are able to chat or perhaps are even close enough to chill, please, for the love of God, help me.

I also feel like this will/is having some sort of emotional/mental reprocussions but I am going to try and ignor that and not process it because clearly the ENTIRE thing is pretty much a bad idea. Especially since he's CRAZY. I really need to remember shit like that before I go and do things without any real reason... At least I won't have a phone in Russia... which will certainly cut down on the residual stalking...

On the up side his kids are great. Inspite of the fact that they are 4, 5 and 6 and we were all stuck in the apartment all day because of the rain. Terrance even asked me on Sun. if I were staying over on Mon. night too and Alex said he asked because he wanted me too.

What I *do* know is that Wed. and Thur. were by far the two strangest days I've had in a LONG time. Like flat out weird shit goin' down.

Anyway what I *really* want to talk about within those two days is all the INTERPRETING and CHILDREN and RUSSIANNESS and PURPOSEFULLNESS and RUSSIAN and CHILDREN... and EXAUSTION.

There is a non-profit called the ""Children of Chernobly Project USA"" that brought 150 children from Russia, Ukraine, and Belorus to the US for a month for fun and great health care. They stay with volunteer host families. These volunteer's don't speak Russian. At all. So they need people like me to volunteer to help them talk to the children. 

I translated Wed night after work right after the children got off the plane in Boston and met their host families. I also found one volunteer family who lives in Middleboro- like 5 seconds from me. So Thur on my way home from work they called me all in a panic and needed me to come to their house to help as soon as I got home from work. And next week I will help some other children at the dentist. (Yay teeth. Since I really like that word in Russian.)

The children are great. Really. And so are the volunteers. And so is the whole program really. 

So this is what I can't really ever explain. How wonderful: they are and it is to help and to be doing something that matters and to be doing that within something that I already love so much and to feel like I really am on the right track and everything that comes along with all of that."

Things I am unhappy about:
-being home
-**missing Smith**
-the 5 immunizations I just had shot in my arms... *oowwww*
-having to spend $250 on luggage... although that is *really* fucking cheep
-the randomest sunburn on Memorial Day... in that I got one at all... *oowwww*
-paying for gas I'm not using (see below)
-shitloads of housework... and most of the mess not being mine
-momentary bordom
-still needing an extra job because I'm broke... 2,000 really isn't enough Smith... just so you know... really... you should get on that... haha, riiiight.
-receptionists who don't know jack about... well... *anything* really
-insurance companies
-the shockingly huge lack of sex or prospects for it in the near furtue

Things I am indifferent towards:
=going to Russia
=being home
=missing Smith
=my grades
=the weather... good old NE, ""wait 5 minutes""
=getting an HIV test
=hahaha the four day hunt for the strange vacinations
=seeing a crap load of people who I knew in high school and partaking in small talk
=having to expose in said small talk all the stuff I've been/I am doing and the mixed reactions that produces
=sharing my car with Chris... I feel like I should be more pissed about this but that's not going to get me anywhere
=eating meat... although sometimes my stomach is a lot less indifferent about it and a lot more unhappy
=needing to go to the public library anytime in need the internet
=being single.... actually I don't really know what pile I want this one in... 
=not knowing what statis quo means anymore

Overall I think both my last = bullet and predominant indifference takes the cake... 

By next Friday however, I think I will have taken care of everything or nearly finished taking care of everything I needed to cross off the list before I go, which means I can sit back and enjoy things... not that I haven't been doing that, but calling my insurance company isn't exacly my idea of a great time... oh, the wrath... the wrath...

It seems unfair that people should spend their lives creating these wonderful friendships- or really any kind of interpersonal relationship- and it will always end with some kind of goodbye.

It starts out about two people and then it ends with one, each on their own, selfishly savoring the memories they have left.  

It also occurs to me that long awaited hellos are no less heart renching.  Today, my parents will arrive to take me home.  Both of them.

I sincerely appretiate your willingness to help me succeed.

This is where I am right now. I don't care. And I have a hunch that this is going to present some problems.

I cannot drink the water unless I have boiled it... as well as a slew of other AWESOME stuff.

I also am pretty sure my visa will not allow me to leave the country once I have entered... this includes the 6 WEEK break inbetween semesters -AND AND AND- The program will be needing my passport from June 26th until the day I leave the US so I cannot travel this summer either. Cool.

However, there are people in this world who somehow do not understand this concept. They also, clearly, don't know anything about me inspite of the fact that they seemingly kind of should. 

Don't get me wrong, ResLife are very nice people. But at a time like this I don't need to be sushed, or offered solutions, or pressed for an end to my rant and calmed down. I just need to freak out. I already have a course of action. I'm not a helpless idiot.

When I tried to explain this I feel like I was completely ignored. Or perhaps it is just because this is what they are trained to do. It's all they know how to do. Perhaps the concept of just leaving someone alone and leting them flip out is not an option to them. 

Either way I was not able to simply work it out myself because my fit concluded with, ""Are you angry with me? I'm here to help you and I don't want to be the cause of your stress..."" etc

I told her I would stop by later but I just needed to write the fucking paper and didn't have time for ""this"" right now. 

Which leads me to another point: women are a pain in the ass. Yes, I'm mad at you and no, I don't want to resolve it right now, so deal with it.

Anyway, I'm going to write the paper now, I just needed to get that off my chest."

"event","I got a call this afternoon from ITS letting me know that the woman who was calling me *accidentally* DELETED MY ENTIRE ACCOUNT.

I believe I can leave that with, 'nuff said.

But, I went to check it about 10 minutes ago, which would be about FIVE OR FIVE AND A HALF HOURS AFTER she assured me she was putting it all back together and: surprise surprise I CAN'T GET MY FUCKING E-MAIL.

I WILL actually kill this woman. I'm not kidding. Seriously. MAME HER. With my BARE HANDS.

The paper is now due in two hours and 15 minutes. That is not much time. And I have decided in the last few hours that I have a lot to say... Which is good, but it takes time to say a lot of stuff, and I seem to be running out of it.

So, away I go! (without e-mail)"

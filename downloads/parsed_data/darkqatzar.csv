im doing this survey thingie for work and im mad because survey are supposed to be easy but this most definitely is not. grr.
and its spirit week and i find i dont care. is that weird? im not sure. guess im not spirited. spirit man made me want to barf by the way. that kid makes me so mad sometimes. i mean, its was one of those ""youve got to be kidding me"" moments. lame-o. tomorrow is green day (totally just got that today) but i dont own any lime green. and im not buying something to wear for only one day. honestly. i dont do bright colors. sorry. except my pen. it is lime green and i love it. i love you pen.
i also love how everyone went to bed beofre me. its only 10:20 people. weirdness. i take that back. my sister, whose bed time is 9:30 is now up again. why. i dont know. but if she comes in here im sending her to bed since she talking to my birds and not doing anything relatively important."

i dont want school to start because i know im going to lose touch with the awesome friends i made from northern. and thatll suck. they start next week. :(

and i hate essays. especially when my printer is out of ink so i cant print out the notes im going to use so i can organize my findings. damn human beings, making a mess of the environment.

and i am annoyed at the complexity of the carbon cycle. i mean, goddamn. come on! every diagram i found decided it like to use numbers instead of words so i have no idea whats going on, especially when its not in a circular motion, like the water cycle (which i love).

im so nervous about this year. im so nervous in general. or maybe more anxious. oh i dunno. ugh.

im quite peeved right now if yu cant tell. however, i had a relatively easy, stress-free, quite boring day. hoorah! i just kind of ate a put stuff in a van and took it out and talked to daren and made fun of audrey (whore is her new name) all day. well spent.(or whoredog, that works too). ahh good times.

i spent about two hours just laxin' in the pool with bailey, then i went out and got the book for english. while i was there i looked at q magazine (which id never heard of ) and discovered that according to them i have good taste in music. for new releases of the summer, they ranked muse as 3, razorlight as 2, and kasabian as 13. and for summer essentials, secret machines, muse, arctic monkeys and gnr were all in the top 20. am i good or what. then i got a slurpee. and when i parked my car in the driveway i popped my cd out so the radio can on and the frst thing i hear is

""im not a hooker!""

which pretty much just completely made my day.
and now im chilaxing again while my (new) ipod charges.

i loved it, even though the power went out at work and i was serving people in the dark via candlelight and two brides had to move their ceremonies inside and the priest for one was a major dickface and wouldnt marry them in from of the guests because he was running late and my manager caught be during down time at least twice even though i was actually working hard both nights. 
other than that i LOVED all this rain. 
even driving in it, not so much, but still love. 
not to mention i had to drive in it about ten minutes after i had had another tooth yanked from my mouth by snake lady who i loathe with a burning passion.

rain rocks!

and so i had a really good day, even though i was sweaty and disgusting for most of it. and i didnt get to go out an eat, but oh well. thats next week!

i painted a masterpiece *cough* last night. did the whole thing in about 5 hours. it need some touch ups, but otherwise is spectacular if i say so myself. ...not to toot my own horn or anything....

i finally finished downloading itunes because im going to bestbuy to get my ipod soon. i love best buy. i went there only a few weeks ago. i pretty much go every week. im really sad. but i love my music. without it id be a withered, lifeless body with no soul.

i hate teeth. i hate them hate them hate them hate them hate them. teeth and dentists and orhtodontists and braces and brackets and extractions and wires and all that bullshit can go to hell. im so damn sick of my damn face.

on a lighter note. my pool is open! im gonna go swimming once it gets clean. because its pretty dirty right now. and then ill get tan and then ill be set. horrah! and maybe the sun will bleach my hair naturally  and my sunglasses and hoorah! i feel like summer is finally starting.

i saw the omen yesterday. pretty dcreepy, but not all that frightening. im sure the old one would have been about the same because the effects didnt seem all that hard to produce.

my own room is making me sick. the stagnant air from the basement is finally getting to me. not to mention the insane amount of cat hair. and on top of that dad tells me he never got the basement checked for any types of radiation so he says there could possibly be radon down there. thats really dangerous. i could seriously die in my sleep. i havent stopped coughing or sneezing for the past three days. 
id prefer not to die in my sleep at 16. 
the bump behind my ear is back again. it was there last night then disappeared today and now that im feeling worse again its back. i dont like it. it freaks me out. and i scrtahced behind my ear last night not knowing it was there and hit it and it felt like myear was bleeding it hurt so bad. so im terrified of this bump too.

just let it be know that i am disappointed. and that if i had known that getting the lead in the fall would affect my getting a good role in the spring, i wouldnt have accepted.

i know i have another year, but i really wanted this. i mean my senior friends arent going tlo be around next year and i wanted an great year of singin and dancing and whotnot on stage, up in front with them. but no. i wanted it so bad. im just so disappointed. ahh!

so i lied. im not done. so sue me.

i dont think this play is going to be evry enjoyable. i think its going to be full of tension and resentment. this is not the type of setting you want a high school play to be set it. it dont think its gong to go over well.

1. im a moron for not readin superhero cmics when i was little. i mean, come on. why was i so stupid? theyre so awesome. i totally want to be an x-man.

2. madonna has been stuck in my head since i first saw her video. other songs have come in but she usually just ends up taking over again. i cant to the ""check out my sexy ass"" walk either. dag. maybe if i have a sexy ass to begin with. maybe when im famous...and rich...and corrupting the entertainment world...oh the days that will come...~sigh~

im in the kind of mood right now where i feel like i could take on the world. and win. that may be because i just watched batman begins after eating good chinese and mint chocolate chip ice cream. because it matters okay? and i wish i was a ninja, even though ive been one for halloween like 71 times. i wish i could do all that martial artsy stuff and  kick butt. maybe later, when ive got some actual time, ill attempt it. i cant wait until i kick my first baddie ass. when that day comes, itll be a good day. i might just go get a slurpee afterwards.

i almost got run over in the parking lot in front of kitchen number 1. maybe if he wasnt goig to fast in a freaking parking lot!. crazy drivers. i think drivers are stupid. i dont like them much. i mean, im not a reckless driver, im justa stoopid one. but i think we all are. i mean, some of us just break the mold, you know, but i guess thats life. maybe if there was more patience, more relaxed. but no, people are impatient, people are rude, people are busy. chillout. smell some flowers. listen to a good song. watch the stars and the moon. (a clear night when the moon is so bright that i cansee things like it was almost day is one of my favorite things ever) dont run people over in freaking parking lots. sheesh!

lets just leave it at that. and the fact that i left with a head ache.

however, officer speed held the traffic for all the students leaving the student parking lot. so we all left before the buses. i felt so seniorly and important. quite wonderful.

the game was so fun. hanging out with lee and sammy was great. i rarely get to talk to lee so fun stuff occured of course. juggling hand warmers (or warm handers). and we met emily there with peter and she reminded me of how i dont have any art projects to do right now and i was excited. 

and i have an essay to write. hrc.

good points.
1. got my homecoming ticket. picking it up tomorrow.
2. snapped at agnew. he deserved it.
3. agnew tripped trying to tell kat to get rid of her gum.
4. the essay isnt due until tuesday. i have a chance to raise my grade with the homework i was absent for and she isnt counting our seminar grade.
5. greg said act 1 was good. agnew told me i was funny, even after i had snapped at him.

bad points.
1. im still sick
2. i still cannot swallow a fucking pill.
3. i cannot possibly do my 5th painting by friday, unless tomorrow just decided not to happen.
4. my face looks probably the worst its looked all year and nothing is helping.
5. im way stressed out.

i had to help my cousin withn her math. i dont want to be mean, but holy crap its like talking to a hoarse wall. nothing stick to her. 8th grade. poor thing didnt know what 75 divided by 3 was. coulnt do positive and negative. poor poor thing.

i finally finished my homework. hard to do precalc when your tutoring 8th grade math.

and i just figured out that they covered rem. ugh. but they do it well. go bush.

on other news, or notes, or whatever, i went to the all by myslef for the first time today. it was exceptionally boring. trying to find costumes stuff to be a pirate is very hard and i gave up. so im just going to wear my black cloak and hope for the best. i bought some black and white makeup so maybe ill just go crazy with that to help.

rock star wig!

and i bought chick fil a and sat in the parking lot of kmart and ate it while listening to bush. probably the best part of the entire day.

we had a music war in art. devon put on muse (heavenly music playing in background as i say the word) and then some kid came over and put on techno. ugh. so we put muse back on. but then he put on the techno again. it was techno for a while before we took his cd out and made him get rid of it. then, fullerton put on mars volta against mue, so they were playing at the same time. holy crap that was so odd and annoying. eventually, it stopped, thank goodness. and muse played on. i painted the stool legs light green after i painted my canvas into a light green abyss. very fun.
then i decided that devon (through many different suggestions and comments) should major in french dancing and that i would major in italian painting. and since we are married, we will communicate though french dancing and italian paiting and not understand each other, like it is now, though were both speaking english. then she told me not to go to college if i was going to major in italian painting, that i should just stay and take more classes with mr bell. that was pretty funny.

i do like my shirt, probably because it says K.I.L.L. on the back and the kasabian symbol thingie on the front. very fun. i got some weird looks at the orthodontist. funfun. i listened to oasis all the way up and my burned green day cd actually worked in my car for once on the way back. i was pretty much ecstatic on the way home until the tightened wire and coil thingies kicked in. then i was disgruntled.
it was cold this morning when i drove to school. my car woudnt start. its such a crappy ole thing. it had a hard time starting after school too. darn thing.

JET WAS AMAZING! they are completely unreal live. they just blew me away. they played al the good songs and then some, even lastc hance, which was my favorite other than are you gonna be my girl. he kept pausing to tyr to gett he crowd to sing it, but they were pretty unresponsive. lame. i lovejet. the only played seven song, how sad, so they need to headline a tour and i need to see them again. OASIS WAS THE GREATEST. i cant even describe their magnificence. they just completely blew me away. i was stunned. they started with turn up the sun, which is kind of a weak opener, but then they played lyla, morning glory, something else, and a bunch of great stuff. they ended with rock n roll star, but beofre that theyplayed wonderwall and champagne supernova. oh so good. but my favorite was live forever. that performance was so extraordinary. i was so dumbfounded by it. and they did an encore, which encded with dont turn back in anger and a cover of my generation. ohmy it was awesome. ahh i wanted it to last forever. i gt a shirt for each band, even though kasabian didnt play i still love them, and a poster, so there goes 81 dollars. approximately 1 paycheck, but it was so freaking worth it all the way. im wearing the oasis shirt right now. its navy blue. i ahvent worn navy in a long time. but omfg i loved it. liam galagher would randomly oss i a few cuss words like fuck into the songs . it was great. on time i saw him mouth motherfucker to on the the audience on the jumbotron. it loved it. and he put his tambourine on his head and just stood there with it on for the longest time. it was great. then he put it on noel's head. ah i loved it. 

next to me on the lawn were two girls and one of the girls' father. the girls aset down the blanket and ten the fatwer came over. he goes ""i have no problem with thhis but there is the pole there."" the girl goes, well, we can just stand up."" shes probably my favorite person in the whole world right now. i wanted her autograph so bad.

thre was so much pot everywhere and alcohol it was so amazing. i prefer stoners to msher anyday. my dad told me that. i laughed really hard. i tihk i do too, except for the large red dancing guy . he was jumping and spinning all over the hill. he was scary. i didnt weant him to run into me because he was about a foot taller than i am. eeee!

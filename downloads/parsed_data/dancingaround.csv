on the strip
lookin' in the mirror and
i'm checkin' out my lipstick
girlfriends up in the back
we're out for all night
feelin' so crazy cool
vibe so right
don't know what
we're ready for
valet baby
here's the keys
we're about to
step inside
skip on the drinks
head to the floor
makin' my way
my body's takin' over
and i want some more
i'll be anticipating
this is our song
they're playing

But its not like I won't build em up again
So here's your last change for redemption
So take it while it lasts because it will end
And my tears are turning into time I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye



I cant live without you
Can't breathe without you I dream about you honestly
Tell me that its over
Because the world is spinning and I'm still living
It wont be right if were not in it together
Tell me that it's over

And I'll be the first to go
Don't want to be the last to know



I won't be the one to chase you
But at the same time you're the heart that I call home
I'm always stuck with these emotions
And the more I try to feel the less I'm whole
My tears are turning into time
I've wasted trying to find a reason for goodbye"

When I am hungry, He feeds me
When I face trials, He is with me
When I face persecution, He shields me
When I face problems, He comforts me
When I face loss, He provides for me
When I face Death, He carries me Home

He is everything for everybody everywhere,
every time, and every way.
He is God, He is faithful.
I am His, and He is mine!"

the games we played are finally over
the moments we spent slowly dift away
all because u steped away
the tears they came slow but fast
i wish i could make this moment pass
you were near but yet so far
talking to you while driving in your car
if i could say the words i mean to say
would i still think about you everyday
.... ITS NOT DONE ......."

We got a 62.15 at our last competition, about a 15 point jump. 
That's extraordinary right. 
And I have this little operation hook-up thing going on.
And guess what?
As of now, it's working. yes, I have a plan that may actually work.
I kicked my Pre-calc test's ass. Or at least I think I did. I feel as though I did.
I have a Chinese e-pal. That's pretty frickin' sweet.
I'm going to NY in March.

Homecoming Friday. I suppose I'm excited. Kind of. Okay, no. Not really... Not at all.
Competition Saturday. I'm hoping we kick butt, but that never really happens the first competition of the season. But I'm feeling confident about it. It's not as hard as it used to be. Go out, have fun. Enjoy that 7-8 minutes. Sweat it out.
Not so much fun to sweat it out at 7am and then going through school all day like that.. That's downright gross. And everyone knows it. So if you see sweaty faces at like, 9am, you know it's a band kid. Or someone who has problems with stairs. You can never be sure. 

And then there's tomorrow:
7am.
School.
Float Building.
Carnations.
Memorization check.
And I get home sometime around 8:30.
Then I do my homework.
And I will be done with my day approximately 11.
I think I'm going to go insane.
And I'm not even in AP Bio. HA! Poor children that are..

"event","So lately I'm determined to drive my ass off to get my license by the end of the month.
Is it going to happen? Probably not. Sorry to every one who claims me their chauffeur bitch. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Chittychittychoochoo.
 So I feel guilty about being rather happy while all my friends are struggling with their stuff. I try to help. But I am so damn happy lately. I have everything. Honestly. I do. I have the best boyfriend, ever. I love him to death. I have the best friends ever who support me for everything. My family is, okay. Haha. And to me, that's having it all. That is all I need. No drama, just fun.
 I still have to finish crap for my Honor's summer homework. Ouch. That should be fun, right. I didn't even read the ending of the book, I looked it up. Anyway. I hate that book. 
 Oh and, post band camp is no go. I hate it. All I feel like doing is goof off with everyone. And I do. Then we get yelled at. It's great, right. I remember everything. I'm just waiting for everyone else to. Mostly the basses. Anyway. I should start reading manga again so I have something to do with this spare time besides write things that no one even reads. I basically just drive myself crazy.
 OhOh. And I plan to have an open closet take all. That means, everyone can come over and raid my closet because it is so damn full of clothes. Well. I might stop everyone in the process and be like 'MY CLOTHES.' But it's worth a shot. Most of my friends/lovers have one of my shirts anyway.. Most have two, actually. At least two.
 And what's with everyone talking smack about everyone? Okay, if you're going to talk about OTHER people behind their backs, you're bound to get smacked by karma and get talked about yourself. It's called logic and the human processes of bitchiness and retaliation. So don't whine when people talk crap about you, take it in stride. Or at least that's what I try to do (usually doesn't work). Guess I should take my own advice. I usually don't. I just give it. I suppose that makes me a hypocrite, right? Oh well. Think what you want.

 Its not my decision to decide what decisions you make in high school, but don't you think its rather dumb to be drinking, smoking, and humping your life away before you're even legal? No? Okay, maybe its just me, damn me and my motivation to get somewhere in life. Obviously you have none. Not a concern about the future. Do you care about college? No wait, you're probably going to SC4 to become a pharmacist (No offense to pharmacists out there.) or a nurse (none to the nurses either). I would rather die than have you be in charge of my life if I end up in the hospital. Honestly, I prefer you to be bagging my groceries, or wait, they now have machines that can do that. So it looks like youre fucked and working at BK or McDicks. Ouch. Thats no good for the complexion is it? 
 I bet your mother would love to see those pictures of you on myspace with a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other. Haha, I hope you get busted. Look, if you're going to do it, don't publicize it. Thats just plain stupid. It doesn't take a genius to look at your profile.

And I'm just looking. and I see their friends, which most of their titles say something like BLANK HEARTS BLANK!!!!!!!! and I realized that also drove me crazy.
    Wow, okay. We get it, for once in your pathetic life, you have a boyfriend, but do you REALLY need to broacast it in such a manner that it makes you look like a desperate douche? Okay, so maybe you are a desperate douche, but does that really make it okay? Not in my book, but who cares about my book? Question, question, question. So anyway. I click on their profile, just to see, and their err, what's that thing called? The quote next to the picture, is also filled with 'I LOVEEVEJKLFJSDLKJ' Yeah, okay, wow. I cringe. Sorry, I don't know, maybe I have issues, but I have a boyfriend, and I haven't even thought of doing that. I find it ridiculous, and it's not because I lack emotion or whatever. I frickin' love this kid, he knows it, I know it, so why broadcast it on <i>Myspace?</i> But then again, I suppose I just broadcasted it on LJ, oopsey. 
    What other problems do I have with people's Myspace names? I can handle the scene kids who have things like Carl Catastrophic, but I can't handle Carl [HAS HAD IT WITH UR BULSHIT!!!!]. These are the people who change their name everyday, and let you know what the hell is going on with their ever changing relationship everyday of the week. One day, [I LUV U!!!!!] the next day, they're broken up, and it goes on and on, making it even MORE annoying. It makes me want to message them and say ""Why don't you just break it off? Obviously you fight every other day or when the weather is bad, so honestly, I'm sick of seeing your myspace name change.""
 I know the easy solution would be to delete them all, but I'm too damn lazy. Instead I'll just bitch about it. It's what I do."

"event","Now I have this mucus-y hacking cough.
Woooo. I guess that means that it's almost over, but it sounds like a smoker's cough. And if it doesn't, it hurts like a bitch.
Well, that's okay. As long as I don't get sick again.
And I've almost successfully peeled off another layer of nail polish, which I put on last night. Goddammit. I can't leave anything alone. I guess it's not like it's anything important.
  So at the nursing home there used to be two cages with two pairs of birds, and they would sing and they seemed all happy with their mates and everything. Then the one's mate died. So they put him in the cage with the other pair, making him third wheel. I dunno, I felt for the little bird, you know? Then the other bird's mate died. So now there are two mismatched birds living together, but somehow, to someone like me, they seem so alone. They don't sing anymore. They look so sad. I dunno, I'm crazy. I can't imagine.

Then. I'm in Walmart. And I seriously wonder how many times the word ""fuck"" crosses people's minds as they grocery shop in such a crowd.
Just put it in front of all these statements:
I lost my kid. I can't find what my kid wanted. What did he say? That bitch took my cart. There goes my purse. No oranges? That bitch cut me off. Why is this so expensive? I've been caught shoplifting. I forgot my list at home. I can't read this. I can't get past these heifers. Why are old ladies so slow? What is that kid doing? I have to be here in x amount of minutes. I can't find it. That bitch cut me off AGAIN. This coupon expired yesterday? Since when did they up the price? What the hell is all over this box? Someone's already opened this box. Where'd my money go?

I could come up with more.
Anyway, I'm done."

Didn't I say something last night about studying?
Yeah, forget that.
Damn it all to hell.
I'm so sick of school.


Oh, I could float here forever.
Not really. Right here is shit.
Rats! Rats! Rats!

Haha. Well, anyway.
I'm drinking my last Diet Cranberry Sierra Mist.
Which marks the end of the holidays, officially.
And I'm completely sad.
Well, I'll choose some parting words. They are:

There's too much effort in what you don't want.


EVERYTHING IS FINE."

"event","Hmm. I hate Sundays, a lot. I'm supposed to be at the nursing home, but my mother decided it'd be awesome to leave me home because I'm ""sick."" So here I am, hacking up phlegm, eating an orange. I know, the vitamin C is a little late, but I try. My new rule is that if I eat something unhealthy, I have to eat something healthy with it. woo.. Yeah, that'll last about 2 days. 
So my life is changing drastically in the past, oh, week or so. It's scaring the shit out of me. So honestly, I'm afraid of drastic decisions, because I'm not in control. How pathetic is that? Oooh, well. I guess I just need time to think, or something along that line. But there's nothing to think about. The thinking's done, and I'm left stalling. For no reason. I know what I want. But there's always something holding me back.

Everything's a stress and what's more, well it's all somebody's fault.

Get over it, get over it.

Makes you sick, makes you ill,
makes you cheat, slipping change from the till.
Had it up to the gills... makes you cry while
the milk still spills. Ain't it just a bitch? What a pain...
Well it's all a crying shame. What
left to do but complain? Better find someone to blame.

(Hey!) Get, get, get, get, get over it! 
Get over it, get over it.

Got a job, got a life, got a four-door and a faithless wife.
Got those nice copper pipes, got an ex, got a room for the night.
Aren't you such a catch?
What a prize! Got a body like a battle

Still looking for that kid.
The one that changes his mind every 5 seconds.
The one that lets me steal his shit.
The one that wants to beat my ex's ass (I'd let him, seriously. I would.The last one was a douche.)
The one who'll sing with me. And dance to anything.
Without being embarrassed. Honestly, what a waste of time.
The one who'll send me message that have tard for the subject.
So when I send it back, it says RE:tard.
The one who'll wake me up because he can't sleep.
The one who'll kick me right back in the shins.
The one that isn't an effin' druggie.
The one who'll just be like 'I know, it's a pisser.' after I complain for 20 minutes.
He'll watch my stupid movies if I watch his.
He knows not to call me Kell.
Must like/tolerate Deftones.
And I dunno.


Yeah, too bad he just doesn't exist, righ'?

Lord knows it would be the first time.""</i>

This song really describes what I feel most of the time.

Doesn't everyone have a song that could make them sad no matter what mood they're in? I have about 5. But I'd say my top sad song would be ""Death by Plane"" by Team Sleep. My interpretation is of someone leaving the one they love..for good. Death, as in the title. Like.. I picture it, being, um, someone's spirit watching their loved one mourn over they're body, as they rise, and they're remorseful and don't want to leave, but it's time.

Then again, I have shit ass interpretations. 

Happy Song? Hmm. I'd have to say ""The Prayer"" by The Bloc Party. It's a groovy song, really. 'Bout dancin' and throwing it down, basically. Especially the ""Does it offend you, yeah?"" mix. I dunno, too bad I'm too white to dance.

Rofl. Speaking of that. Last night I got asked if I could drop it like it's hot. Odd. I said I was too white.

Most sexual song I own? Eh. ""Rein Raus"" by Rammstein. It's about. Horses. Riders. Um. YEEAAAHh. It's in German, though, so it's easily disguised. Rein, Raus means In, Out. So yeah, you get the picture, right?

I have too many angry songs to count. Not that I'm always pissed, but I'm sure the songs contribute. ""Lotion"" by Deftones is pretty raucous. But I own some songs by As I lay Dying. Too bad I don't listen to 'em. Who knows.

Do I own any hip-hop? Yeah. Honestly. I got some. a little. Mostly Beasties, which doesn't really count. But I like Atmosphere, not a lot people have heard of them. I have some Eminem, too. He's pretty cool. Ahah.

Then there's MSI. What to do with them? Industrial Jungle Pussy Punk. That's their own genre. And what can I say? I'm a Mindless Freak. I love these guys. 


OKAYOKAY I'M DONE."

"event","Jerry Springer. What a riot.
It's like watching the same show every morning.
A transvestite who cut their legs off today.
Now that is American entertainment.

What would Jack Thompson do?

Probably try to sue the TV station broadcasting it, claiming it was teaching children to be transvestites and to cut their legs off.

AH, what a douche.

So I get done reading ""Eclipse"" the third installment of Stephanie Meyer's ""Twilight"" trilogy. Damn, those books make me so sad, and I love them to death, really. Perfect balance of vampires and romance. ...Yeah, I'm a nerd, I get it. But, the drama in that book, tsk. Poor Jake. But I was pretty dang upset yesterday, over a book. Odd.

 In fact, I feel sad now just thinking about it. I'm a closet lovesick, I guess. I'm a sucker for the love stories. Especially the love triangles. 


ANNNNNYYYWAAAYYYY.

It kinda ruined the game, which made me smile =] I mean, do I really wanna sit in the stands playing LETS GO BLUE 50 times over? Nah, I don't think anyone does.
Not that it matters. I mean, practice tonight anyway.

I dunno. I feel pretty umm, abandoned anyway.
Or like I live on the other side of the planet
Orrrr something.

So the Olsen twins are moving on up from Walmart to The Row. A better line? I'd hope so. And 80-year-olds having sex. And Hello Kitty vibrators. Trend hunter is pretty awesome, all the best news of course.

I've been up for 2 hours and I'm delirious and tired.

Huh.


If you slow down Draw Japan, Faris sounds even cooler =]
Most people wouldn't agree with me, 
But that's because I have an odd sense of what is music.
I like noise, static, disgust inflected into the voice, slouched sounds, apathy, shrieks, moan, and spazzy guitar.

You know what I miss? Daft Punk.
Those guys are awesome. For some reason the song ""One More Time"" makes me sad. It's a good song, but it's not really..sad, per say. Ah, what the heck, I just have issues."

Here I am, watching the same show i watched yesterday.
Band camp starts Monday. Just kill me already. UGGHH>
At least it's only 3 hours a day, or else I'd really start to bitch.

IDKIDKIDKIDKIDKIDKIDKIDK.

I've been doing crosswords and watching the Hills all day
So basically I managed to lower my IQ today.
And slept on the couch
And watched the clouds, my neighbors must think I'm retarded.

One time I saw this cloud.
It looked like a guys head, side profile, right?
And as the wind tore it apart, it looked like his head was exploding.
It was the coolest cloud I've ever seen.

Anyway, enough with the crackpot stories.

I whine. A lot.
About everything. When I can't talk about anything else, I whine.
MWAHAHAH.
You know what the coolest song of the moment is?
YES. You guessed right: It's Drawing Japan.
Faris Rotter is amazing. Honestly.
Not as amazing as Chino Moreno, don't get me wrong.
That man can sing, moan, scream, shriek, whatever you please. 
And it sounds fucking gorgeous.
If I ever saw Deftones live, I'd probably have to bring an extra set of pants because I'd piss myself.
It's orgasmic, if that's the type of person I was.
Then. If I ever got to meet them, I'd bring two sets of pants
Because I'd piss myself all over again.
Then drool and not be able to communicate.
AH. OBSESSIVE.
Anyway.

Ew my wart just ripped off =/

Honestly it's not like anyone reads this.
I could be all
HEY I'M PREGNANT and no one would know.
NO I'M NOT.

"event","So anyway.
Was at the nursing home today and goddamn,
It makes me think
If that's my future, kill me before it happens
I don't wanna sit around eating bland and tender meat
and smell like death just waiting for it to come.
I don't think anyone does, unless you're so drugged that you don't even know what room you're in or who's talking to you, just so you can stay alive.
But then again, what would be the POINT of that life?
Unless the family keeps telling themselves in vain that you're alive, and you must be happy, when in reality you probably can't even function to talk or move your hand. The comfort that you're alive is enough to keep them from letting you go to rest.
Well, enough about death and suffering.

Ummm. 
When I go outside I can feel the sun burning my skin. It's no fun D=
So I've been sitting in my little camper staring out the window. I have a great life, eh? Yeah, I know. I don't even feel like I've showered today because I feel so gross =o But, yes, I did, okay?
My rabbit managed to somehow kick me in the armpit and leave some lovely, bloody scratches. Not to mention the little ones all the way down my arm.
 
And apparently I'm getting left alone on my birthday.
Wtf? Thanks, glad you care, family. My mom has to go to a meeting thing and she's all 'Oh, I'll drop you at the mall if you want.' Thanks. And then my dad's like 'Oooh, we're pouring cement on your birthday.' Hell no. I'm not taking part in that. So I guess if anyone wants to meet me at the mall on Thursday, what the hell?
I think I might just venture off in a bit..

"event","<center>I never realised how much I rely on attention.
I need it.
Or I crash.
When someone compliments me, it's like turbulance.
Coming from some people it throws me off.
Other's makes me get high. 

So that means I AM self concious.
I DO care what people think.
I WANT to be cared for, complimented, noticed.
Call me human.

I'm working on something. Can't get it really good yet though;
It's like...

He loves the way she leaves a trail of black ice
She loves the way he slips and falls after her.
He loves they way she pulls her lashes, the black on her fingers.
She loves the way he pays attention.
He loves her crimson sharpened nails.
She loves the spider's web of veins running up his arms.

Yeah. Weird. But I've been trying to add on for about 4 days now.
I kinda like it.
Who knows where it'll lead.
I haven't written anything in such a long time,
So it's kinda cool that I finally got something
No matter if it's crap or not.

Lately my head's been filled with monsters and demons.
Things that kids are scared of.
That crawl underneath your bed.
No real reason; I just kinda create em in my head.
But I can't draw it out.
I can never draw it out because my hands don't have the ability to match the picture in my head.

I NEED to write.
That's why I'm here.
It doesn't matter if anyone cares.
Or reads it.
It's for my benefit.

I'm so fxcking stuck on him.
I managed about 6 months.
Now we're pretty good friends.
He says he loves me.
I say I love him back.
But we all know how that goes..
They never <i>really</i> mean it.
They mean it in a ""brother/sister"" ""friend""
Kinda way.
And like I dare to tell him otherwise."

"event","<center>Do you know the feeling of tears being held in too long?
It's like, at the back of your throat, and it tightens.
And tightens more.
And more.
It aches.
Then you cry.
For about 5 different reasons
Because it's been held in for so god damn long.
And it ruins your face.
It's ugly; 
Clenched teeth
Squinty eyes
Forhead creased.

When all you want is someone to cry on.
While everyone says ""fuck you.""
It'd be nice to know that someone out there cares.
But you'll never know.
Because you do it when you're alone.

And you wanna punch someone.
Or the closest mirror.
Or just disappear for a while.
Or at least get your way once.

You just wanna land one right on someones face.
That's what I'd like to do.

And get blood drawn.
I swear to go. Give me a new pancreas.

My dad looks like a jelly bean with legs.
Just an observation.

I'm going to cry during the blood test.
Just out of habit.
I just start crying.
I'm not really scared or anything, I mean,
I used to have to get it done every 4 months when I was little.
but I got a barbie afterwards.
Now it's like ""Scooby doo or Spongebob bandaid?""
Spongebob, thanks much.

UGH.

Wednesday is too far away.
10PM Wednesday I get my next fix of PR.
Thank God.
I dunno why.
I'm hooked.

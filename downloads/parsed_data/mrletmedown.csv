Because it's not important. And it doesn't matter. Because no one is worth a heartbreak. Fucking remember that. Not a damn person alive is worth your heartbreak. They don't deserve it. She isn't getting it. Not this time. I don't care, ask me if I give a fuck. No. I type fucking fast when I'm angry. In the words of Atreyu.. Live, love, burn, die."

"event","Problem is, I don't have a title. If one were to make a movie about my life, what would it be? Would anyone watch it? Would the person who made it even watch it? I hate everything I do. I hate how my fucking mind works against me. Whatever I try to do always blows up in my face. Whatever I try to express is projected incorrectly. I'm not a good son, a good boyfriend, a good student, a good anything. The part that fucking sucks about it is that I try. And I never try to do any real harm.. I just try to be helpful.. And those of you who know me (like anyone who knows me would really be reading this) you know I do.. I'm just not good at any of it, as much as I want to be, it doesn't look like I'll ever be more than the grounded stump of subconcious stubborness I am today. But I wasn't always like this. There was a time where people thought I always said the right thing. Where I could actually make some people feel better when they were down. WHAT FUCKING GOOD AM I NOW? I don't do fucking anything. ANYTHING. I just want her to be happy, that would just honestly mean the world to me. You people have no idea how great I feel when she's happy, when I hear her laugh and I know she just has a huge smile on her face. I certainly don't put it there anymore.. If you have any advice.. I'd truly love it.. That's all for now..."

This is truly my all-time favorite song.. If anyone has any trouble getting it, I'd be happy to send it to them. My AIM is everAURA and my msn is everAURA@HOTMAIL.COM . Anyways.. Without further adue.. Bad Astronaut.

Wait, planet earthquake 
Planet heartbreak, give me this day 
Dates pass through a maze 
Are you okay? Are you awake? 
Pride, yours flies to high 
Yours is to great, yours is to die 
I, I'm taking no side 
I'm going under, for once alive 
Wait, falling airplanes 

Today, my worries fade away 
In suspended dream state 
Somehow I knew 
Erase, everything stops now 

And now I crash with them 
I am a bank deposit 
I'm held accomplice to man's will 
The faith transcending reason, 
The passenger descending 
And in an instant time stands still 
Fade, planet heartbreak 
Stop thinking..
Hello?

------------------------
Anyways.. I guess I really can't complain. But here's how things are going. Ahh fuck it, we both know you don't really care.. And we both know that no one is really going to read this.. I'd actually be really suprised if anyone even got this far into this message.. Well I guess as long as I'm typing... I might as well make it worth my time. I hate myself today. I really do. I remember a long time ago.. I used to be this really sweet loving guy who everyone really liked. But I've changed, into some selfish monster that clearly resembles my father. I really want to change.. I really want to be that extremely sweet charming guy.. I know there's only one real way to do it, through God. But I don't seem to have the desire to seek God out anymore.. I guess we all lose our desires once in a while.. I just have to find it again I guess. Anyways... Lauren... I hate being her boyfriend.. Because I've become so selfish and demanding, I can never be sensitive to her anymore. And the worse part is that I truly don't mean to do it, I really love her.. I really don't want to lose her.. But I know she deserves so much better.. I think the right thing to do would be to break up with her and let her find someone worthy of her, you know? But I'm too selfish for that as well. That girl means everything and more to me. I go nuts without her.. I just feel that if I don't make some serious change soon, I'm going to have to let her free. Because I know she loves me, but she really doesn't need the bullshit I bring her.. I really do feel suicidal some days.. I know what I have to do though.. To be happy.. It's just all a matter of doing it now..."

"event","Hey everyone.. Things are going pretty okay.. We just finished remodeling my room which is pretty cool. I got to pick my own colors and stuff.. So it looks pretty awesome.. I'm in a pretty good mood.. I miss Lauren though.. Okay so she has this away msg.. That doesn't sound at all like it's to me.. And she's like call me tomorrow and stuff.. And it's just kinda weird.. I dunno of anyone she'd have to leave an away msg to call her for.. Should I be.. Worried or something? Should I even mention it? I don't think I will.. Always gets me in to trouble.. The last thing I want to do is argue with her.. I always make the stupidest mistakes.. And it's just not worth it. Even if it is like some other guy.. I don't even wanna know.. Or think about it..

ANYWAYS I'M GOING TO A SHOW ON SUNDAY! The last Glasberg show.. Now all I have to do is find my Glasberg shirt.. And I'll be GOOD TO GO! It's going to be wild.. I have a bad feeling about my friends new boyfriend. I hear nothing but bad stuff about him.. I dunno.. All I can do is hope for the best.

Anyways (again)... I got pulled in to the counselors office today.. And I guess like alot of the teachers and the principle think I'm like the smartest kid in school or whatever.. Which makes me distressed, because if I'M the smartest.. I really feel sorry for the school.. But I guess it did boost my self esteem a little.. Which is good.. I don't have much self esteem. To sum up the conversation, they said I'm very gifted and talented, But there's no way I'm going to graduate this year, and it's my senior year.. So I pretty much only have one good alternative.. The CHSPE. Which I was planning to take anyways. The school says they wanna help me as much as possible to pass it.. So we'll see how that goes..

Anyways (again.. Sorry)... My friend Matt has finally found God, after a long time of just doing drugs and nothing good for himself.. I've never seen him happier or more alive.. We're actually starting a christian band together, so we'll see how that goes. He's very gifted.. In art.. Be it poetry, writing, singing, playing instruments, drawing.. He's amazing. And I'm a two-bit singer/no-talent guitarist.. Hopefully he has enough skill for the both of us..

Okay, so I'm done talking for now.. If you got this far... Thanks for reading what I had to say.. Sometimes I feel like.. I dunno.. Everything I do is in vain..

I really mean it... Thanks..."

""Everything is going to be okay""

Does that ever work? Do those words ever make you feel better? Maybe they stop working.. Maybe sometimes you just need something more.. It's not like I like being miserable.. Unhappy.. Just so hard always comming in last place. Knowing that the person in first doesn't really deserve it. Then again, I'm probably in last place for a reason, right? 

Just knew what it was, so I could change it. You'd think it's all self esteem.. But it can't be, because in the race, I give it everything I have, telling myself I'm going to win.. Then again, what do I know? I'm in last place right?

Something has to change.. I am tired of losing. I am tired of feeling out of place in my own house. I don't want to be the underdog anymore. Or maybe, I SHOULD just get used to it.. Used to being pushed aside. As if I don't exist. Maybe I don't.

So where's dad during all this? I dunno, he doesn't answer my calls. BTW by dad I mean God. Lauren doesn't understand me.. I try explaining things to her. I know this is very cliche teenager, but nobody understands.

I don't know what to think anymore.. I'll write when I make more sense.. Thanks for listening to me.. Non existant companion.."

"event","Okay.. I have no one to talk to.. So I'm going to vent through this live journal. I am now going to be as open and forward as I can be. I don't even know if anyone will read this, be that as it may, I know I'm going to regret it greatly when someone does.. But this is how I feel at the moment. I'm tired of this vacation... My aunt is one who plays 'favorites', and I'm not the favorite. To most people, that wouldn't matter... But.. Josh (my brother) has always been favorited over me. I try not to care.. But it's like.. I just want some attention.. Good attention.. Lauren and I just argued.. I dunno what to do.. So much going on.. I want to go home.. I want to see my friends.. I'm an asshole. I'm selfish... I don't know why people even like me. Most people wise up and hate me after a few months of knowing me, the ones that don't, I treat like shit.. I'm so tired.. Emotionally.. I just want to go home.. I just.. Want to be wanted.. And more than that... Understood.."

"event","It just occurred to me that I'm not even sure if anyone's ever read this fucking thing.. And I'm too lazy to check..  A whole bunch of bad things happened.. I won't bore you with details.. But.. lemme lay out the basics.. 

I moved to NY for my mom.. She needed me, so I was going to be there for her until she settled in. Lauren called me at lunch at work on a friday afternoon and told me we had to talk.. So I got online and we talked.. She left me.. And suddenly I felt like I couldn't do it anymore.. The entire time, Lauren had been my backbone, all my support to do what had to be done.. But on that day.. Everything ended.. I collapsed. I messed up about $200.00 worth of merchandise that day.. When I got home, my mom wanted to talk to me, so we talked.. And she let me go home..... 

I had left her... I had failed everyone.... I had failed myself.... And once again to mark the end point in another chapter in my life.... I was alone.... One could only imagine what went through my head... But then I truly found the grace of God.. And just when I'd hit the bottom of my hole.. He gave me a ladder and I climbed out. So I came back to California.. Lauren was my friend.. But we all know how THAT goes.. Uncomfort.. Rules.. Etc..

But things got better, everything started progressing.. No longer did I have so much weight on my young shoulders... Weight that with all I've already been through, I couldn't hold.. And it only got better.. My mom moved back to CA, and is now living with my rich aunt, she set her up with a house and a career, she's good to go. 

Then.. Two nights ago.. It happened.. Things were going great with Lauren.. Real great.. I dunno if it's something she felt.. Or something I did/said... Or a combination of many things.. But she said ""I'm glad we're back together"".. And I was once again the happiest guy alive.. Now.. I have my Lauren back.. I have no worries/stresses/burdens.. Not major ones anyways.. I can breathe again.. I can live again..

Now I'm getting ready for a 2.5/week trip to Italy.. And Paris.. I know.. Great, huh? Well I think so too.. Only thing is, my brother is comming with me. The motherfucker lives to criticize, patronize, and put me down for every fucking thing I do.. So that's not good.. I'll try not to let it ruin my good time though..

Anyways.. Things are going good with my entire family.. I hope they'll stay that way.."

"event","Well.. My parents are getting divorced.. More bullshit.. My dad doesn't care.. Blah blah blah.. Anyways.. I'm moving to NY. For 11 months... Until I'm 18.. Then I dunno what. My friends and I want to get an apartment somewhere when I get back.. How I'm going to miss them.. They mean so much to me.. And I'm gonna leave them for a year.. For what you ask? My mom. I feel obligated.. I am obligated. I can't do anything.. I'm totally stuck. But if I wasn't going to NY, I wouldn't go home.. How could I? With a father who never gave me any kind of attention.. BTW.. My father is the worst person in the world.. Literally. He's a con-artist. When you meet him, you'll think he's a righteous christian man with morals.. But underneath that he's a kiniving woman beater who loves alchohol and hookers.. Then he tries to sit there and preach to me about God.. Heh.. Anyways, Lauren's being real supportive about everything I'm going through.. I couldn't ask for more.. I love her so much... I don't think it's right at all for me to make her wait so long.. I was going to go see her during vacation.. But as you can see those plans have been foiled. I tried though.. Really hard.. My friends say they're going to make shirts that say ""Freddy Will Be Missed"", lol, that'd be sweet (in the non-teenager definition of sweet). Anyways.. I'm in pretty good spirits.. For my moms sake.. But I really don't want to leave everyone and everything behind. All I have to my name is a few articles of clothing and my pictures of Lauren, and I think like $1.47. Pretty pathetic, but that's me, and that's the story of my life.. Heh. Anyways.. That's all I have to say right now.. I don't think I'll be writing in here much because I wont have a computer to do it from in NY.. I'm going to live in a tiny apartment with a whole bunch of people.. So I'm going to get a job as soon as possible to change things..

Anyways that's it..

Later everyone.........

Anyways, yesterday was a really good day.. I went out with my friends.. BZ's house.. She dyed my hair.. It was supposed to be soft black, but it's pretty fuckin' dark. We did some other stuff.. Play a few games.. Listen to music.. That's pretty much it.. Everything's going pretty good right now, I can't complain.

"event","I'm angry at myself.. I want to call Lauren and apologise for being such an asshole.. I never understand her at the time we're arguing.. But once we get off the phone.. I think about it.. And I feel like an idiot. I was a total asshole to her and I really wish I wasn't. She's an amazing person.. Beautiful.. Inside and out.. Lauren is my girlfriend btw.. Long distance thing.. >_<! Anyways.. Now I'm not going to see her for a week and it's all my fault.. Should I call her? Should I email her? IM her? I dunno.. Maybe she deserves some time away from me.. I think I suffocate her.. But she's all I got.. And when she's gone, I have nothing.. I already miss her.. But I have to be strong! For her! I think I'll email her and tell her that everything's okay and that I want her to have fun and stuff. Just so when she's out, she's not with a heavy heart doing everything.. I really love her.. But I think she's going to break up with me soon.. I wouldn't blame her.. I'm such a fucking ASSHOLE. I hate myself to death (almost literally, but we'll see) I really need to treat her better. She deserves so much better, and if I don't, I know I'm going to lose her.. I really don't want that. But like I said, I wouldn't blame her. I wouldn't be with me either. She loves me.. Atleast I hope she does.. Anyways.. This is me in my ""God dammit, I FUCKED UP AGAIN!"" mood.. I just really really wish she'd make a little time for me.. =\

Anyways.. I'll write a little later, just to let you know what's going on..

Later..

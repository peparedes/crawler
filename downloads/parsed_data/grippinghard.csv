I still havent gotten over the thought of the person who so called told me to be professional in every situation -- to be so unprofessional. My hatred for her has risen from hell to heaven. I hate her. i hate her to the depth of my soul. its not just that. MY girlfriend is going home to davao. I mean!!! fuck making her go back to davao wont make her straight. but thank you ! thank you for messing up our lives.. our future."

It's 10 in the morning. I'm in the library. Waiting for Joe to text me so I could go study at her place. I went drinking last night. THere's this promo at some bar here. We had margarita. I was with the masters students in Biology. By 9 pm I had to go over at Joe's place to wer off the alcohol. I can't go home drunk. My parents doesnt usually notice plus margarita doesnt smell. But I just felt it safe to do so anyway. 

Alfred took me to Joe's bhous and then I slept for a few minutes with her hugging me. SHe teased me. She likes it when I'm drunk I think. I hope I'll get to go out tonight. So many invitations I dont know who to go with. I cant go with joe. . . she'll be with her org then. *sigh* But I' hoping to spend time with jan, eik and joan.... 

I saw joan on my way here. She's been busy with her being nursing. So is Chutz.. I missed them. Sobra. 
I cant wait till founders day. THen I'll be able to get wasted and have SOO MUCH FUN. 

I wont be spending time with Joe on founders day though. her parents will be there. But with so many activitites. I still cant wait!!!

My hair is growing longer. :)

Joe gave me this cute lacey spagheti strap for our monthsary. I'm wearing it now. She doenst usually want me wearing straps when I'm out because she's scared of me going home  alone with this. But since we'll be going home together ok lang. 

I just came from the elem. I'll be having an IPR thing with the pysch students --- they'll be handling an activity for y-buds. I use to be a y-bud girl. :) Proud to be one. I had alot of good memories.:)

I havent eaten yet. Me and Joe's getting fat. We eat alot. We spend so much for food and coffee. 

I'm so different from who I was a few months ago. I'm even fun to be with when I'm drunk now. And I can gooble a few bottles of rh before getting really tipsy. Fun fun fun... Ilove it. 

I feel more productive tooo.

Janet... 
doesnt exist. 

I was reading some of my entries from my previous blog and the whole topic was her. I just cant believe... :) nev mind. 

I'm confuse still as to who to go out with tonight . doesnt really matter just want to ..."

"event","I think I had too much coffee today. I had a cup for breakfast and then when I was on my way to school to meet up with JOEBEhb I met eika. Joe's classes doesnt end till 10am and twas still 9. Eika invited me for coffee at memento. So I did, havent hanged out with her for quite some time. AND THEN Joe met up with us after her class. Ate peanuts and talked and laughed and was soooo tempted to get some bottles of beer. (of which I am addicted to i think ---ive been having daily cravings... and ive been drinking everyday almost for the past few weeks. Not with joe with some bio friends). 

And then after meeting up with eika me and joe dropped by at her house to take a shower because it was sooooo hottttt.... too hot. igang hot. oily hot. (get the picture???).

then we went to chantily because it was cool there. her class starts at one pm. I didnt have class the whole day. I'll have my midterms tomorrow the whole day and my teacher gave me the whole day off to study. *phew* and then we had coffee. I must have  more than 4 cups of coffee. More than I usually have in a day. I feel so extatic. Oh my gooodddddd.... I feel like jumping up and down and dancing my ass off. Gawddd... 

I'm having a sweel day though. I slept really early yesterday. How early? as in 6 pm early and woke up around 8. It was one perky happy morning. AND MONTHSARY NAMIN NI JOTHAN!!! hahaha... 

Joe wants to see a picture of my ex. I've no idea... we laughed the whole time we were in chantilly and it was so fun fun fun fun. she had bolognese. No we had bolognese for lunch. Then we talked about our schedule for this weekend. No class monday. I'm worried about sleeping over at her place the whole weekend. My parents would probably kill me!!!!

I'm joining ... hopefull PanHell next sem. Its my dad and joth's org. I'm a bit nervour about the initiation. The paddle and pschy war and all. I noticed all the panhell guys have really strong personality. 

School's been great. 

And oh yeah.. Tita juvy invited us for lunch last weekend. It was sooo fun. First girlfriend i had dinner with my family. hehehe.. it was cool. tita juvy was really nice to both of us. And my dad knows joe na. And he seemed ok with it... just be careful because hes a good friend of her family... being brads and sis and all. Because joe's parents are also panhel. Its pretty cool. we have almost the same background. I hope we could save enough money for davao. Eika and jan and joan are all set .... my friends might help me ... im not ready for the trip didnt have any plan to go... untilll ... hahahahah

Its lunch naman diay. Have to eat. ~end"

We go to the beach, river... bars on weekends. So i guess its alright. I love it. Will post pictures when i get the chance.

Now. I'm just happy I got away from the kunot belly and fatso. :) I'm stuck with perfect  figure and perfect tan.. excellent swimmer. ate babes. thanks for the advice. it went perfectly well. 

I'm hungry. I have to wait for an hour till her class is over. Then we eat at her apartment. sleep for a few mins then run off again to our classes. The good thing is that i dont have a curfew here and i can sleep over anytime. and the place is my uncles so i dont have to sign up everytime i have to go there. perfect.

Thinking about it I'd rather be excited about the next things I'll be going throught alone. I realize that theres absolutely nothing wrong witht that. 

Ahm.. I'm going to be hanging out with jason ... No commitments. 
Leaving my old place by tomorrow too. Just didnt like staying in that place. too many memories. Not that I'm bitter just not ready. JUreiga thought it was a good idea. I am paying the same amount just in a different place. I'll send you guys my new number soon. 

Will hang out with Mai too. she promised to keep me company. I think i just promised to sleep over. I dontknow. I'm not sure what I really said exactly awhile ago.

Jureiga was right about me not thinking of all the possibilities. In a way im excited. Excited about work.

I told jc about someone too. He said it was ok just make sure kaya ko na walang commitments. *laughs* as if kaya ko magcommit right now. 

Now lets go to what I think...

I cant wait to go back to work. 
To meet a lot of couple new people. 
:)
excited. very.
I cant wait to work my ass off all night. 
have fun. sing songs that i naturally like. dress up the way i want too.. soon. for now. and thenwho knows what this life will take me.  honestly i dont think i want my journal back. that was what i felt. s and i dont think i want to remember what that felt like. I feel a big weight off my shoulders. becoz i dont have to worry about anything. just what i have to eat for the next couple of days but then thats what i worried about even bfore this happened.

then...
who knows. so much possibilities. :)

Some of my friends still cant get over it. I wish I could say it all here in detail but I was drugged when it happened. I dont know.. I wish I could pull the pieces together somehow. At least not to make me feel that a few hours of my life was stolen from me. But then maybe its a good thing not to know. God knows I mights not be able to handle it.  I dont know...

ANyways I'm so glad I don't have to go through my grandmother's self pitying moments.Maybe the reason why I'm so into self pitying myself is I spend too much time with her when I was back home. (i PROMISED SOMEONE I'LL CHANGE ANYWAY SO DONT WORRY ABOUT IT). I really am. That I don't miss about her. I remember she use to come over to our house because she and my grandfather wants to get anulled. Pathetic, right? Imagine your old grandparents after 40 years of marriage.. plan to get anulled. Argh. And the next thing you know she tells us she can't live without him. Sounds familiar I KNOW. Well maybe I could have gotten that from her genes too? OR NOT. Maybe that's how it is when your living with an alcoholic.. is it? Anyway my grandfather's alcoholic. He has this attache case that he carries around at work (before he retired of course) and before when I was little he use to let me carry it for him. Inside would be a bottle of Tanduay and a small shotter... along with all the files that he had to work on. ? well anyways nobody in the office ever complained. After all he is the boss. POWER. Fucking pathetic. I love him anyway. Miss him even though he's an asshole.

Either my minds just faster than my hand that I tend to miss out words when I write or I'm just a pathetic literarily challenge person. Hahahaha.. (if such word ever exist anyway). 

Yesterday was Andrea's birthday. Sorry Andrea I totally forgot. I realized that it was your birthday around 2am na. Better late than never right? I wonder if you'll ever wonder off to my LJ.  
I dont know why but I'm just not comfortable giving out my blog address. Hahaha.. Its for strangers to read I think. 

I'm editing my i.ph blog. while waiting for it to upload I figure I'd try to write something here. So whats there to spit about...

There's me missing Batsy. I'm sorry for throwing you against the floor when me and Laura fought. I really am. I still feel guilty up to now. Sorry. That wont happen again. I promise. Sorry baby. I Miss you. Sorry if I cant take you in at home yet. I'll find a way to do so anyway.  I have to clean my room tomorrow. Fuck. And also I have to wash my clothes. Fuck ang dami."

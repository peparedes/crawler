Look what I can do!  I can walk, I can run, I can<br>read! I like to do stuff, and there's a whole<br>big world out there to do it in.  Just so long<br>as I can take my blankie and my Mommy and my<br>three best friends with me, of course.

"event","I made this cake in school last week.  Alia brought it with her for a night on the town with friends.  She reported back to me that her friends said it was ""very adult"".  Adult must mean very boozy, as it was soaked in apricot liqueur.  She also made the gay biker bartender's evening by giving him the rest of the left over cake.  I am proud of this cake and the photo - looks like a picture in a magazine, don't you think?"

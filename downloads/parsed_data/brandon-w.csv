"event","This weekend at our store was our 1 day sale that lasts for 2 days (don't ask). After working a good deal already this week, they had me come in Friday from 745-445. Normally, I work afternoon/evening hours so this was a change. I barely got any sleep the night before, but I made it to work. Afterward, Marissa picked me up and she wanted to eat before she went to babysit. Having enough energy to do so, I said lets go. When I got back home, I went straight to bed for 3 hours. I woke up about 9 and had a snack, then knew I had to get up at 530am the next morning for a 7-5 (10 hours) shift so I took a sleeping pill and dozed off around 11. I get to work and from 7-8am, there's absolutely nothing to do so it makes you tired being in a semi-dark store to start off the day. Around 10am, my face starts to burn and irritate easily. It was hurting and now the store was starting to get busy. I shaved 2 days ago so it was odd to start now. I went over to where they have mens products and found a razor burn relief formula for $25 which was the very good shit and put that on. Instant relief! After that, I didn't get to have lunch until I was 7 hours into my shift! By this time, I was hot and tired and very moody because I was ringing customers nonstop and you add everything I wrote above. It doesn't make a happy day. At 215, an hour after I thought I was going to eat, Marissa and Jessica met me outside Panera. Instead of staying in the mall which I kinda wanted to do since it was miserable outside and I myself was also, we walked over to Chili's. We were seated promptly and I automatically said 'smoking' to the waiter because I myself smoke. With no objections heard, we sat over in smoking. After our orders had been taken, I light up, which was to start the most dramatic scene i've had to deal with in recent history. After everything I had to put up with those past 2 days, I needed to have a cigarette after waiting 7 hours to have one. If you're a smoker, you'd understand this completely. I knew that Jessica didn't care for smoke and didn't want to smell like it. I scoot over to the other side of the booth. The winds in the restaurant were seriously not on my side. It was going into Marissa's face and some was getting at Jessica. She was getting upset at it and, having little patience, I was being difficult and said I needed to have this cigarette and I wanted to get it done before lunch came. I truthfully don't remember all that I said which is odd, but I made her so upset that even when I finally did put the cigarette out, the damage had been done and she asked to have her food cancelled and left the restaurant. I blocked out the feelings I was having and just ate in silence. Marissa stayed because her food was being cooked and probably didn't want to be a pain to the server and cancel her food also. Then, she lectered me about what just happened and then brought up other things I have done that had made her and others upset in the past. I just couldn't handle anything at that time so I rudely just said forget it it'll never happen again and we ate in silence once again. After 5-10 minutes of eating, she asked for the checks and boxes. We packed up the stuff and left. I was definately not myself today and I hope they saw that and I do ask for forgiveness in how rude and selfish I was today. It was a bad day already and to ask me to put out what helps me out when i'm stressed or had a long day I just wasn't going to do easily. I made my 2 best friends mad and upset at me and it hurts to know that. If its true that best friends stay together through thick and thin, in good times and bad, and that their love is unconditional, I hope you do find it in your heart to forgive me for what I did. Without you, i'm nothing and with you, i'm everything."

We had our first rally on campus when the democrats decided to have a democrat US Senate debate. We were outside the debate having fun eatin pizza, holding signs, and letting people pass by that Yes, there are republicans at SRU. There will be many more events with much much bigger turnouts. I'm estimating our next rally in the fall will be at least 100people. This rally wasn't bad for such a short notice. I do expect better though. I do have pictures posted on ricksantorum.com and here's the link

I got to meet Rick's campaign advisor and the main man in charge of the website. I'm now in touch with so many high up people its great. With me being president, there will be major changes. I'm drafting a much better constituion, a huge campus canvas that no matter where u go on our canvas days, you'll see us spreading the word about our group. I'll have weekly advisor meetings, biweekly group meetins, projects to help our community, and our own rallys and debates so both sides are shown. It'll be a lot of work, but i'm dedicated to the cause. And I will NOT have another term of Slick Eddy. GO LYNN SWANN!!!!"

I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start preaching
Let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my T.V.
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Yes, some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?"

Who the hell in their right minds would do this to a church? That nativity has been put there across my street every year since I was born. I'd always just go over and visit it in the snow and it was a great thing they had. I just don't know where this world is going anymore. People don't have any morals or any realization that there are consequences to all their actions and God knows everything. Even though I'll probably never find out who did that, I know that they'll be judged by God himself and he'll do what he feels is right. It just pisses me off.

Holiday display in New Kensington destroyed

By Wynne Everett
VALLEY NEWS DISPATCH
Tuesday, November 29, 2005

Bernard Sipe shook his head and wiped tears from his eyes Monday afternoon, unable to describe the scene that greeted him when he arrived at work shortly before 8 a.m.

At his feet, on the lawn of First United Methodist Church, lay the broken remains of the church's nativity scene.

""When I saw that, I was fixed to kill the person who did it,"" Sipe said, choking back tears.

After discovering the vandalism, Sipe, who is the church custodian, found church trustee Rich Rosenberger at the nearby New Kensington YMCA. Together, they surveyed the damage.

Six human figurines, including Joseph, Mary, three wise men and an angel, along with manger animal figures, were smashed. Church members had set up the nativity Saturday and dedicated it after church services Sunday.

The only figurine that was spared was the baby Jesus, which was safe inside the church. Church members don't place him in the manger until Christmas Eve, Sipe said.

""They busted up St. Joseph, they busted all of them,"" Rosenberger said. ""They busted all the heads off. It was pretty nasty. We're done for Christmas. We can't decorate now.""

Church officials reported the vandalism to New Kensington police, who didn't return calls for comment on the incident Monday.

Sipe said he wouldn't clean up the nativity debris right away.

""I'm just going to leave it lay for awhile so people can see what they've have done,"" Sipe said.

The Rev. Bramwell Kjellgren said the church had hoped the nativity would inspire people passing by in another way.

""We wanted so much for people who go by to understand Christmas is not just about stuff,"" Kjellgren said. ""It's about the message of Jesus Christ.""

Church members had discussed buying new nativity figurines last year, but the $4,000 replacement cost was more than the church's modest budget could afford. Instead, a church member took the figurines home and gave them a fresh coat of paint. Another member built a new manger to hold them.

""Now we've got the manger, but nothing to go in it,"" Rosenberger said.

Kjellgren said the vandalism will sadden his congregation.

""Our church has felt this nativity was a special thing,"" Kjellgren said. ""I think it's going to break a lot of people's hearts in the community.""

Still, the pastor believes the true spirit of Christmas can't be diminished by the vandalism. He also called for church members to act forgivingly.

""I, as a pastor, don't want to condemn anyone,"" Kjellgren said. ""Jesus Christ is the reason for the season. He came for everyone, even those who don't love him."""

Tragedy hits couple
  			
By Stephanie Ritenbaugh
VALLEY NEWS DISPATCH
Saturday, November 26, 2005

It appeared the newlyweds lost everything when their home along Olive Avenue caught fire Friday morning -- even their wedding rings.

But as firefighters were sifting through what remained of the ranch-style home, they found a small, damaged black box containing Heather Smalley's engagement ring and her husband Scott's wedding band.

""It's dirty, but it made it,"" said Heather Smalley, as relatives and firefighters helped sort through photo albums, pictures and other items left undamaged or salvageable.

No one was home when the fire broke out late Friday morning at the corner of Olive Avenue and Saxonburg Boulevard.


The house was engulfed when fire companies were called around 10:40 a.m., according to Ed Gorney, chief of Harrison Hills Fire Co.

The fire isn't suspicious, Gorney said. A preliminary investigation indicates the cause of the blaze is ""undetermined, accidental,"" officials said.

The couple, married Nov. 12, was living there for only about a month-and-a-half with their two children.

Heather Smalley's 8-year-old daughter, Kiersten Sholl, was in Pittsburgh with her grandparents to see the Radio City Rockettes perform when the fire broke out.

Heather, who is three months pregnant, has another son, Brenden Knohley, 3.

""He doesn't really understand what's happened,"" Heather Smalley said.

Smalley was out shopping with her son and father and returned to see smoke coming from the house.

""We think it was the furnace because the fire came from the furnace area,"" she said. ""Thank God we weren't home because we probably would have been in the game room watching TV near where it started.""

Firefighters had the additional challenge of bitter weather as they tried to subdue the blaze.

The temperature was about 24 degrees late Friday morning, but wind chill made it feel like it was about 14 degrees. Water from fire hoses began freezing on the roads and around the fire scene, making the footing tricky for the volunteers.

""We have to watch out for ice,"" Gorney said.

The Smalley's said they were grateful for the support they were getting from neighbors.

""They've been getting clothes together,"" Heather Smalley said. ""They've been unbelievable. We want to rebuild right here. This is an awesome neighborhood.""

One neighbor offered a gas stove.

For now, the family plans to stay with relatives.

Also responding to the fire were Citizens Hose and Hilltop Hose in Harrison, Pioneer Hose from Brackenridge, Eureka Hose in Tarentum, Freeport Volunteer Fire Co., and the Salvation Army Tarentum Corps.

If you or someone you know would like to donate to help them out in their time of need, please let me know. Thanks."

"event","where do i begin...

well, let me begin with the halloween party that happened a good while ago. It was great. I was a priest. The main part was when i had to climb off the balcony and run into what was like swampland because someone heard someone say police so the ppl on the balcony, including myself, headed for the marshland.. It turned out after that it was a dumb security guard that just came in and said for us to quiet down and that was it. I came back fron walkin in muddy  water close to my knees and my shoes completely filled with water. It was fun though.. hehe. Much more happened, but I don't feel like spellin out everything. You just had to be there.

I don't really remember the 1st week of november so there's nothing to say. Last week was alitle crazy for me. My damned tooth started to hurt bad again so the dentist called in pain meds again for it, but they again didn't touch the pain. Tuesday night, I was tired of the pain and was messin with the tooth when it chipped a good bit on the side. A couple hours after, my entire left side of my face was swollen to a point where it was hard to speak! I called my mother and she found a dentist that would finally pull the damn tooth that i've been waiting to have pulled for about 2 months. My dad picked me up wed and I got it pulled on thursday. The new dentist said she didn't know why they waited so long to do anything with the tooth. Well, finally it's gone so I won't have to deal with that anymore. 

Saturday afternoon, my sister Heather got married to Scott Smally and she's very happy. I went to it and the after party and my dad kept bringing me over pitchers of miller light cause it was an open bar so I drank a good bit :) It helped me keep my mind off of the hole in my mouth that was healing. It was a good time. 

Now, this week is busy. Monday I studied for 2 exams today and took them. They seemed easy so i'm happy. I have 1 tomorrow to study for which I will do when i'm done typin this out. I also finally scheduled classes for the spring today. Here's what it's gonna be...

MWF Intro amer music 10-1050 
MWF United Nations& int. law 11-1150 300 level and a republican teaches it thank Heavens!
TR French 930-1045 
TR General Bio 11-1215
TR Princ. Econ-Macro 2-315

3 there are the last of my enrichment coarses then it'll be all 300-400 level next fall. Also found out that to get into a law school in PA, i should at least have a 3.5 and get a 154 or higher on my LSATS so I gotta keep my grades up! Next fall, i'll start understanding what my friend todd, a senior, feels when he's constantly studying for stuff it takes up most of his life! Oh well, thats why i picked a major that comes easy to me. Anyways, I gotta get going so I can get enough studying and sleep for tomorrow's exam.. after this one, no more exams till finals week :)

on another note, i'm very upset that Link won a second term as mayor.. But, you gotta admit, republicans never did well in new ken elections and Fularz only lost by 370 votes! He's got it next time!"

"event","Well,

Today, I spend the whole day with Marissa. We went almost everywhere we love to be.. franklin, tionesta, marienville, sigel, cooks forest, enp natrona, then back in new ken around I think 11. It gave us time just to relax from our sometimes hectic lives and enjoy the world around us. We talked about many things and had a lot of fun :)  
Last night was also fun.. to a point. All i'm gonna say is I get very upset and worry a lot when friends that I care about don't take my advice when I give it. It's happened a few times. Now, on here, I don't name names because it's just not right. I write journal entries because it's therapeutic and it helps me rest better at night. The parties involved know what happened. To me, there's fault on both people. Maybe i'm not the one to be talking because I haven't led the life of a saint. No one has. We've all made mistakes. The difference here is it was so easy to prevent, yet no one tried to. One person involved I am disgusted with.. he probably doesn't read my journal, or just doesn't have time to, but if he did, he'd know it's him. How can you go through life doing what you do without consequence? Is this a game for you?  Sooner or later, everyone pays the price for the wrong they've done. The only thing you can do here is repent for what you've done and hope for the best. I'm going to end this journal with a quote which everyone knows from pulp fiction. 
'The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee. '


Disappointed is how I felt for part of the day.. not when I was with marissa :) I had a great time! Thanks hun!"

It's already October! Why the hell aren't the trees changin yet? Turns out they will peak this Saturday and that's when my girl Missa is gonna come visit and we're gonna go admire them :)  At least that was some good news to come outta this week. Everything would be fine except for my molar that is hurting like hell. I get to have a fun day oct. 11 goin to the dentist to get it pulled.. I actually can't wait. I called up the doc and he was nice enough to give me Vicodin for the pain, which, believe it or not, doesn't seem to help much. It's been an almost constant pain since Sunday. I did get orajel which seems to work, but it wears off during the night tonight and I keep getting up putting more on. That's why i'm up typing at 2 am with a 8 am class tomorrow. I took another vic about 2 hours before I was supposed to, but I need to get sleep so I can go to class. Recently, I've just been sleepin in not goin much. I go when there are exams and I do quite well on them, but I just gotta go. There's no excuse. Then when I want to miss class because of the pain i'm in, I haven't went so I can't just not go tomorrow either. On top of that, I got a reps meeting at 5 and elections will be taking place. Hopefully, no one will want to challenge me cause i'll be out of it being on vic and I wont know what i'm sayin hehe. But enough about my pain. I worked over the weekend at Kaufmanns cause most of my friends around here work on the weekend so I said might as well make money. It was fun, but VERY BUSY in shoes. I was walkin all day with no stoppin, except on my lunch. It was fun though to see everyone I work with.. they were all happy to see me. well, I gotta rap this up.. hopfully I can sleep. i'll write again soon.. maybe after the pain is gone!"

"event","The Republican Party - GOP History

Abolishing slavery. Free speech. Women's suffrage. These are all stances the Republican Party, in opposition to the Democratic Party, adopted early on.

The Republican Party was born in the early 1850's by anti-slavery activists and individuals who believed that government should grant western lands to settlers free of charge. The first informal meeting of the party took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, a small town northwest of Milwaukee. The first official Republican meeting took place on July 6th, 1854 in Jackson, Michigan. The name ""Republican"" was chosen because it alluded to equality and reminded individuals of Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party. At the Jackson convention, the new party adopted a platform and nominated candidates for office in Michigan.

In 1856, the Republicans became a national party when John C. Fremont was nominated for President under the slogan: ""Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Fremont."" Even though they were considered a ""third party"" because the Democrats and Whigs represented the two-party system at the time, Fremont received 33% of the vote. Four years later, Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican to win the White House.

The Civil War erupted in 1861 and lasted four grueling years. During the war, against the advice of his cabinet, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves. The Republicans of the day worked to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, the Fourteenth, which guaranteed equal protection under the laws, and the Fifteenth, which helped secure voting rights for African-Americans.

The Republican Party also played a leading role in securing women the right to vote. In 1896, Republicans were the first major party to favor women's suffrage. When the 19th Amendment finally was added to the Constitution, 26 of 36 state legislatures that had voted to ratify it were under Republican control. The first woman elected to Congress was a Republican, Jeanette Rankin from Montana in 1917.

Presidents during most of the late nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century were Republicans. The White House was in Republican hands under Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush. Under the last two, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, the United States became the world's only superpower, winning the Cold War from the old Soviet Union and releasing millions from Communist oppression.

Behind all the elected officials and the candidates of any political party are thousands of hard-working staff and volunteers who raise money, lick the envelopes, and make the phone calls that every winning campaign must have. The national structure of our party starts with the Republican National Committee. Each state has its own Republican State Committee with a Chairman and staff. The Republican structure goes right down to the neighborhoods, where a Republican precinct captain every Election Day organizes Republican workers to get out the vote.

Most states ask voters when they register to express party preference. Voters don't have to do so, but registration lists let the parties know exactly which voters they want to be sure vote on Election Day. Just because voters register as a Republican, they don't need to vote that way - many voters split their tickets, voting for candidates in both parties. But the national party is made up of all registered Republicans in all 50 states. They are the heart and soul of the party. Republicans have a long and rich history with basic principles: Individuals, not government, can make the best decisions; all people are entitled to equal rights; and decisions are best made close to home.

The symbol of the Republican Party is the elephant. During the mid term elections way back in 1874, Democrats tried to scare voters into thinking President Grant would seek to run for an unprecedented third term. Thomas Nast, a cartoonist for Harper's Weekly, depicted a Democratic jackass trying to scare a Republican elephant - and both symbols stuck. For a long time Republicans have been known as the ""G.O.P."" And party faithfuls thought it meant the ""Grand Old Party."" But apparently the original meaning (in 1875) was ""gallant old party."" And when automobiles were invented it also came to mean, ""get out and push."" That's still a pretty good slogan for Republicans who depend every campaign year on the hard work of hundreds of thousands of volunteers to get out and vote and push people to support the causes of the Republican Party."

"event","*I backdated this entry because I wanted opinions on a paper so I wanted that to come first when ppl visit the journal*


I'm always non-plussed whenever Liberals use the term ""separation of church and state"" because it basically does not exist anywhere in our Constitution, as indicated by this great article titled ""The Myth of the Separation of Church and State"":

    Anytime religion is mentioned within the confines of government today people cry, ""Separation of Church and State"". Many people think this statement appears in the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution and therefore must be strictly enforced. However, the words: ""separation"", ""church"", and ""state"" do not even appear in the first amendment. The first amendment reads, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."" The statement about a wall of separation between church and state was made in a letter on January 1, 1802, by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association of Connecticut. The congregation heard a widespread rumor that the Congregationalists, another denomination, were to become the national religion. This was very alarming to people who knew about religious persecution in England by the state established church. Jefferson made it clear in his letter to the Danbury Congregation that the separation was to be that government would not establish a national religion or dictate to men how to worship God. Jefferson's letter from which the phrase ""separation of church and state"" was taken affirmed first amendment rights. Jefferson wrote:

    I contemplate with solemn reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" thus building a wall of separation between Church and State. (1)

    The reason Jefferson choose the expression ""separation of church and state"" was because he was addressing a Baptist congregation; a denomination of which he was not a member. Jefferson wanted to remove all fears that the state would make dictates to the church. He was establishing common ground with the Baptists by borrowing the words of Roger Williams, one of the Baptist's own prominent preachers. Williams had said:

    When they have opened a gap in the hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the Church and the wilderness of the world, God hath ever broke down the wall itself, removed the candlestick, and made his garden a wilderness, as at this day. And that there fore if He will eer please to restore His garden and paradise again, it must of necessity be walled in peculiarly unto Himself from the world...(2)

    The ""wall"" was understood as one-directional; its purpose was to protect the church from the state. The world was not to corrupt the church, yet the church was free to teach the people Biblical values."

You may have seen the commercial, but if not, i'll tell ya about it.

It starts out with an old woman sitting at her diningroom table. She's sitting there all lonely and sad and touching the silverware of the empty place setting. She's doin this for about maybe 5 seconds all quiet...
A voice comes on 'It's ok.. Just tell your grandma you blew off dinner with her so you could go get high.'
It was a drug-prevention commercial. Our hard-earned tax dollars at work.. i'm sure the ad will really get people to think about that... HAHAHAHAHA!

Anyways, I thought i'd share that. I thought it was funny anyways.."

"event","Well, just got back home from kings with my buddies ben and sutton. The summer is quickly winding down and by next friday, my address is slippery rock till next may. The summer was fun. I got to hang out almost daily with my girl Marissa then got to see my other great girl Jess when she got back from her, what seemed forever, trip to argentina. So many great things went on the whole summer that its too much to write so i'm not going to since it's around 2am! Thanks to everyone for a good time! Next summer will be even better cause being close to, but not yet 21, does put restraints on you since many of my friends are a grade higher than myself. I can't wait till I get to go bar hoppin hehehe!!! Now, I'm lookin forward to an awesome fall at college. I'll be takin a lot of classes in my major, which is the greatest, and i'll be havin parties and/or goin to them at least once a week cause you need a break from all that work! I got a lot to do with my republican club since we have the biggest freshmen class in history comin so I gotta get the word out that we're here and here we shall stay! Here's whats funny.. when the state committee came to help us open our group, the book they showed me had the slippery rock club listed under lack of good leader. I said our president is a senior now and he founded the club, but they insisted that I become the leader because they said I had 'potential for greatness' hehehe. So, i'll be workin as hard as I can to make that club an even bigger success and when Mark graduates in may, I guess i'll take his position, as long as the voters want it that way. Anyways, lots to think about.. I will miss my job though since I won't be working there until christmas break. Everyone there is so nice and respects me and they make me feel part of something great. It's a wonderful feeling. I'm so happy that I waited until the job fair and had the guts to do an 'on the spot' interview. If I wouldn't have done that, who knows what i'd be doing.. not much with no money! Anyways, to all who'll be up at sru, can't wait to see ya! Everyone else, enjoy the fall and be careful and I'll see ya xmas break and we can party it up new years '05!!!!"

"event","Alittle after 10, I went outside for a smoke, enjoying the day and night that my parents went to ohio to visit my bro so i got the house to myself. Soon, after sittin there, I saw 2 people bolting down my street covering their heads with their shirts. A mintute after that, It felt like a scene in GTA. A police helicopter came outta nowhere flying very low near my house circling the area with a spotlight. I'm like 'great what's goin on now?!?' I didn't hear any shots oddly enough, but seeing the paper and the news today, there was a shooting on the corner of Catalpa and Constitution and 2 men were shot. It turned out there were two guns fired; a .40 calibur and a 9MM. 15 casings were found at the scene. 
New Ken is finally feeling more and more how it was and still is in Arnold. Since 'weed and seed', which covers near the projects, more and more gangs and shit are moving up near my neighborhood because not as many police are in my area. In the 'weed and seed' zone, state and local police patrol the area with 'blanket' warrants, which means they can stop any 'suspicious' car in the area and search and question the people in it. It sounds like a decent plan to help rid the area of crime. Here's the downfall; All people have to do is conduct their 'business' outta that area such as near my house and the nicer areas of new ken that aren't in that zone. Police have less 'power' because they are out of that zone. To sum it all up, they're moving their operations somewhere else because they can get away with more things. As it turns out, no one came forward about the shooting because everyone is afraid it'll get back to them because, like the in xfiles, you can't trust anyone. The word will get out some way or another. I finally now feel vulnerable when I walk the streets at night (which isn't often, but I do walk to friends' houses near my area to hang out). I had my father bring me home because it was dark tonight when I left ENP in new ken because I don't want to be out alone. I'll feel better when I turn 21. Reason being is that i'm goin to exercise my 2nd amendment rights and purchase a handgun for protection with a concealed weapon permit so I can have it on me. It may sound harsh, but you prolly don't live in as dangerous a town as mine. It would be a defense of last resourt. But, if somethin goes down and i'm outside and they're shootin, I'll have it in case, God forbid, somethin happens to me. That's why our founding fathers made that amendment so we could protect ourselves and our property against anyone who would try to take it from us. Anyways, I gotta clean my room, but I felt like typin what happened. It's not every day somethin happens near my home, although it may start to happen more and more until something is done about it."

"event","Today was my day off and I rested as much as I could for the days ahead. If you've seen the tv today, you've prolly heard that annoying 'im so excited' song. It was our ad. We our having our august sale and everything is on sale. It'll be hectic but i'll survive.
In other news, I was #2 in sales for Sunday. Not to bad if I may say so myself. Monday was a spectacular day for me. I made over 1,500 in sales and opened a whopping 4 Accounts! I've opened 6 in a week, which is great, but never 4 in one day! I was happy. Got around $12 handed to me on the spot so I didn't do to bad that day. Tomorrow and Thurs are the 115-1015 days in Childrens which I seem to like. If I can make sales like that and open that many accounts, by all means, keep me there! After this week, I only have 2 weeks left of work then off to sru. Also, the mystery shoppers started this week so I gotta be extra kind and loving to my customers, although that's all i've been doing so it won't be a bad transition. What's odd is that this one girl I worked with Sun told me she is very shy and can't approach customers that well and I wondered to myself, why in the hell would you want this job when customer service is the main thing?!? She didn't have her gold star yet and I can prolly see why. Hopefully, she does better so when april comes around, she'll be considered for a raise... Well, I'm goin now. I'll go work the rest of this week and if anything exciting happens, i'll update."

"event","Sorry I haven't updated in awhile.. I usually work till late then pass out on the couch downstairs, wake up around 10 and eat dinner, then type for a little online then off to bed. This week, I worked sun-thurs which is the first time i worked 5 days consecutive since the store has opened. 
I'm beginning to realize how fast time has gone. I mean it's already Aug 5! 3 more weeks of work and i'm back at college! Today, I got my check and spent the day with Jessica shopping for things. i bought an 80 pc. kitchen set at target and bought some nice shirts at kaufmanns in the waterfront since we were there. With my discount, i got $15 off my purchase of $54 which isn't bad at all! So, when i get my bed-in-a-bag set for my bed, i'll take $15 off of that and it'll come to around $10 for the entire set with all the dicounts :) I love it :)  Anyways, Marissa is off in Michigan this week so she hasn't been around. I was glad though Jess came home around the perfect time! It's fun goin with her. For dinner, we ate at Fridays which was fun also. I also have the day off tomorrow so my plan is to get as much sleep as my body wants, clean up my room, then go for a walk or somethin since i haven't been able to get any exercise in. My feet usually ache from standing 7 hours straight so going for a walk just doesn't sound fun. It should be fun tomorrow. I gotta get into shape! But anyways, I have really nothing much else to say, except for I can't wait to get back to college!!!"

"event","I worked Monday and had a bad day.. It wasn't work or anything, but my ciatic was hurting really bad, my teeth wouldnt stop hurting, my feet were killing me, and I took vicodin for it and it wasn't working. I was just glad to finally get home. 

It was nice having today off. I got an apt. with my doc and he gave me muscle relaxants and 600mg ibuprofin to take since i'm off the vicodin now. It's exactly what the health center did for it. He said get some rest and relax.. That's exactly what I did... took the meds and got tired and slept from 2-7. That's after i slept from 2am-12pm last night. I feel about 90% better and i'm ready for work tomorrow. I work from 1245-945 which is a decent shift.. I think its the one that goes the fastest. I didn't see marissa at all today.. depressing.. i guess she decided to go out and when she goes out, it falls on my day off.. odd. It's not planned that way, it just seems to happen that way. oh well, it was good just relaxin today and not goin anywhere. My mom was even out for the day so that made the day great. Tomorrow will be alittle lonely after work though cause marissa has a test to take the following day so she cant go out. Wait a minute here... 2 days without marissa!?! I'll go through withdrawl! hehe. I guess i'm free tomorrow night so if anyone has any ideas, let me know.. dont work till 1245 the next day so i can be out late :) Anways, i'm goin now. c ya."

I was #1 salesperson 3x this week. Tied for 2nd 1x and dunno about today cause i'm off tomorrow and it gets listed in our newsletter. I sold over $10,000 in products this week alone :) They love me there. I love me there :) Sorry but when you're somewhere 40 hours or more a week, it becomes the main topic of your life. 

Anyways, about today. Got my check. Dad cashed it for me so I got the money yay. As always, I pick a nice place to go to dinner with Marissa and this week was the Olive Garden. It was like I died and went to heaven. Everything we had to eat was sooo yummy I loved it. The check was $42 but it was well worth it! I bought some pants at pennys.. sorry K, but you dont have a big and tall and I still need that section for pants bitch! I went down a size in pants, so soon I wont need to go there anymore :)  My feet have been hurting so I bought dr. sholls memory foam insoles for my shoes.. They have to be the most comfortable things I've ever used. Like everyone told me, It was like walkin on a cloud (and I know what that feels like firsthand!). I can't wait to use it for work. The only thing I was pissed about today was that they took out that fuck you tax (a.k.a. occupational 'privilege' tax) of $52. Since my checks aren't too much, that took a bite out of my net pay. I hate fuckin taxes! That's why i'm republican hehe. Anyways, i'm gonna chill and enjoy my night since i'm off tomorrow. Enough typing. c ya."

"event","Hey everyone. Today was a nice day off. The shocker of the day is when I got up around 1, I asked my mom if she'd like to go to lunch. She accepted and we went to Tommy Chen's on 5th. Great chinese food let me tell ya! For lunch, we got a lot of food and the price was good.. around $13. Go there if you have a chance. You'll know i'm right! After that, I hung around home and worked on the net figuring out different things and buying my cingular gophone :) My new Cell # is 724-216-3981. I didn't receive the phone yet, so DON'T call it! It comes in the mail Wed and I'll get minutes on it that day so Wed evening is a good time to call :) and it's unlimited mobile to mobile which is nice since most people use cell phones these days. Around 7, I went with Marissa and picked up a few things here and there and after droppin stuff off at her house, we went to pick up Ben and Danielle so they could join us for ENP. It was fun and I think everyone enjoyed themselves. I picked on Danielle (none of it serious :-P ) about not having her gold star yet hehehe. We played hangman and used most quotes from Anchorman. One of the many I used was the title for this entry :-P Great times! Tomorrow is charity day and Danielle and I work and it's gonna be crazy! I'll be done around 945, if the registers get closed early enough. Anyways, that's all I got for now. I'll let you know how work was and if I survived or not. C ya."

I went to see the fireworks in Pitt with Marissa, Tina, Ben, and myself. We had a really great time. Ben and I especially liked the 'somewhere over the rainbow' display they had.. hehehe. After that, I was invited to come up to marissas house with tina after, but I was tired and had work the next morning so I declined. It was a great night though.. well, any night when Ben's around is a great night.. hehe :)  Tues through Fri, nothing much happened. I worked till late, took naps, and went to ENP almost every night like usual. Saturday was fun. I had the day off so Marissa and I went to the beehive, then went to see James Taylor in concert at pitt post gazette. That was awesome, like usual, except that he didn't play shower the people. Damn Him To Hell!!! But it was good none the less. 
Wow, got through the week quicker than I thought I would!
Today, It was a 'soft opening' at Kaufmanns which isnt advertised so if people are in the area and happen to stop by, we were open.  It was a decent day. I was all pimped out in my suit and was helping customers. When the first few came, I got very nervous, wondering if I could handle it. Well, I did as best as I could. The first hour was alittle strange and it took awhile for me to get out from the counter and greet customers. When I did greet them, it got much easier and the day then flew by. In my area of textiles and housewares, I had the most net sales! I didn't get to open any new accounts though because everyone that I rung up had a card already. That's good in a way because if they receive a comment card, and they liked my service, I could end up getting my next star which would be awesome! I know on Tuesday, our charity event, I should open up at least 5 accounts since there will be over 13k people there! To get technical, you should average about 1 charge every 30 hours worked. The great part is the employee gets $3 an account, even if the account isn't approved! So everyone, go up to textiles and find me and attempt to open an account with me please :)  You get 15% off (10% at any other Kaufmanns!) and I get $3 and the company is happy with me so in the end, everyone wins. Isn't that nice! I'll stop there cause I feel like i'm making a sales pitch and the people that have been around me are kind of sick of hearing about Kaufmanns by now! hehe. Anyways, that's about it. Just to add, I just got John Grisham's new book 'The Broker'. I just read the first 5 chapters and its a page turner!!! Also, I'm looking forward to seein some friends I havent seen in awhile tomorrow sometime. Should be fun :) Anyways, gotta go enjoy my night since I don't gotta get up early yay! C ya!"

"event","I felt great about today. I woke up around 11.. Didn't get my check so I was very pissed about that. I'm walkin in on Tues and demanding direct deposit Now or i'm just not going to work there anymore! But enough about that.. I went with Marissa around 2 and traveled to the book store with her to get some money. Later on in the day, I went to her house for a great cookout. The food was excellent! After that, we stopped over the NK block party and talked to a few people then Marissa wanted to volunteer at the St. Mary booth so she dropped me off at home.. Before that, we went to kmart and got some fireworks for later that night. When she was done around 9, we headed up to msp to see the fireworks. We picked the perfect spot and the fireworks weren't too bad this year. After that, we went up to her house and had leftovers and coffee.. that was pretty much the day.. got back around 120.

Now, on to the title of my entry... I saw this odd away message one of my friends had on IM and so I im'd him to ask what that was about. From the start, I knew it was shane and he was saying belittling comments to me thinking it was funny, but it really wasn't. I guess they, with little things to do, must've thought 'hey lets look up ppl from new ken that are gay on a profile site and make fun of them'. I guess since their life is so much better and acceptable that they can belittle others and mock them. Toward the end, they were like 'chill man its just me' and all that shit... Oh, that makes it all better doesn't it. Hmm.. let me make fun of my friends then say 'i was only joking fag' and see what reaction i'd get. It wouldn't be a positive one i don't think. I guess some people just don't grow up... I guess if you actually interact with ppl that aren't like you and you live with them in a dorm or something, you become a more accepting, more rounded person in the end. Some people don't get to experience that and I feel sad for them. I just can't see some of them being successful in their field when you can't respect others for who they are. I know in the past, I was the same way. Marissa and my other close friends would tell you that.. I was just like them.. making fun of ppl we thought were gay and that and in the end, what did we get outta that?? Nothing. exactly nothing. And i'll tell ya what.. if ppl expect to be successful when they actually stay on a campus with different people, they better learn to respect others. That's the way it is. I'll never forget this one girl from minority affairs that came in our fyrst class and said 'I hate the word tolerance. It's respect. You may not like who I am, but you will respect me. If you can't respect people that are different, you'll never make it anywhere.' Well, i'm done talkin about this. It just made me upset and I type when i'm upset and it makes it better. I do feel better. Now I can go on with my night."

It turns out since the new ken post office sucks, the check Didn't come! Marissa was there. She would tell you I was pretty pissed off! Luckily my dad was there and he got his check and loaned me money till hopefully tomorrow to pay him back. Anyways, we made it to hard rock and it was great. Afterwards, we drove around alittle since we had time to kill before goin out with Tina. We went to the Kaufmanns in Pittsburgh cause I wanted to see how their dress code was so i'd have some idea. It was alittle after 7 and guess when the store closed!?! ya at 7! Anyways, we had to go pass ross park mall so she brought me up there to see their store. Let me tell you this much; their store is shitty. Nothing is kept neat. No one welcomed me when I walked in the store ""requirement is 10-12 seconds when you enter"" and the lighting sucked, it was warm, and all in all, just plain shitty. Maybe they don't have enough associates or something, but something needs to be done to that shithole! I told Marissa I think I need to wash my hands after being in that store! Anyways, after that, we stopped at a fireworks store and I got some stuff then we went to get Tina. We hung out at you guessed it.. ENP, but not the usual, but the one on Mcknight Rd. It was decent. After that, we dropped Tina off at home and called it a night. Now, i'm extremely tired and I can't sleep in the way I planned since I gotta check the mail in the morning for my damn check! If its here, I gotta walk down to the bank before 1 and cash it, but I don't mind that. I just want the damn thing to come! I worked hard for that money! 
But, anyways, i'm off work sat, sun, and mon but I got things planned. But, give me a call anyways if you wanna hang out or somethin... I can always fit my friends in! Anyways, thank you for shopping at Kaufmanns Valued Customer. Please do come again! It was a pleasure having you! By the way, that's a nice eye you have there! It really stands out!"

I went to work today and we had our usual rally before we started, and they told us at the end we have some people to recognize for their achievement and them earning the Gold star. Out of about at least 50 people, about 6 of them received their star.. I was one of them :) :)  They announced my name and I was so proud of myself. I pinned it on my nametag and felt happy the rest of the day! It feels cool to be one of the first people to get them. The managers were the ones with cards to evaluate how you interact with other coworkers and how well you do your job. I must've done well to get it this early in the game. The workers from other stores that were there for a couple days said Wow it took me over a month to get mine so you're doin well! But anyways, I just wanted to mention that cause it's big to me. Tomorrow will be an easy day. I don't gotta go to work till 9 and from 9-1 is register training, then my hour lunch, then work till 6. I can't wait till Friday to get my paycheck! I'm bringin Marissa to either Olive Garden or Hard Rock.. not sure yet, but I think Hard Rock is in the lead since i've never been there before. It should be fun.

I worked the 12-9 shift and it was all overtime which was nice :)  I worked with my supervisor Mark till about 530 then he left. He said he really likes the job i've been doing and let me in charge of the whole 2nd floor myself! That was fun. I did the few errands that he wanted me to do and I was done about 2 hours before clockout time, so I walked around and straightened things up a bit. I then ran into my HR woman Christine and she said people have really liked how I've been working. I said I know Mark does a lot. She then said it's not just him saying that, it's all the managers :) That brightened up my day! The managers were given papers that they would report how each worker does and how they interact with other workers. The reason being is we have a 'star system' which rates our levels of performance. Not to get into much detail, there is a gold, burgundy, ruby, and diamond star. You work your way up through it. When and if you reach a diamond, you get a paid day off from work and you get an expense paid diamond banquet in St. Louis for all diamond star members in the US. But anyways, she said they are very impressed with me and thats a great thing! I work as hard as I can, keep a fun attitude, and go with the flow and people like that. I've made so many worthwhile friends and its such a great experience. I'm glad I ended up getting a job there. You'd think being on your feet continuously working for 8 hours would make you alittle grouchy, but I leave with energy and a smile on my face because everyone is so kind. I mean being able to joke around with your boss only knowing him for about 4 days is a pretty good sign! Since they like me a lot, i'll prolly get more overtime hours if I want them, which they seldomly give.  
I think now i'm just gonna chill and relax with my beer and sleep in tomorrow :) i hope everyone is having a great summer and I hope to see ya soon. Take care!"

Marissa came and got me, and about 4 till 8, we went up the ramp to the mall and parked in front of Kaufmann's. It was exciting just to be one of the first to see it because the public isn't allowed until opening. I got inside the store. It's amazing! It's a beautiful store. After lookin around, we received a tour of the store. After seeing that, we went to the entrance of the store in the mall. Although we couldn't walk through the mall, I must say the view is spectacular. It is so huge in there! You can't see the other end of the mall when you're lookin from Kaufmanns. They still have a good amount of work to do before opening, but they assured everyone it will be done on time. My job today consisted of opening hundreds upon hundreds of boxes and getting the stockroom organized. They have some nice stuff there I gotta say. While I was stocking the stockroom, I met a kid named Phil. He's really cool and we hit it off from the start. For our 1 hour lunch break, we both went down to Sheetz and got somethin to eat since there is nothing at the mall yet, besides a really nice employee's lounge with pop and vending machines.   The people that will be working with me I gotta say are a great group of people. We joked around. We laughed. We made the work day go by fast. I joked around with my supervisor Pat who is a very nice lady. I guess working at Kaufmanns for 10 years sucking up to people and being overly nice has an effect on a person! I also ran into Christine, my human relations officer who does scheduling, and she gave me all the hours I wanted! The total hours for this week will be around 48 hours pd. time. Yes, 8 hours overtime! Yahoo! I get 9.75 an hour for those babies! Anyways, most of the 2nd floor is looking pretty nice. A couple more days and we'll be moving downstairs and starting on that. I can't wait until it's completed and i'm all dressed up casually walking down isles helpin people and such. I just think that if i'm having this much fun doing the most work you can do in a Kaufmanns, wait until it's all done and i'll be walkin around in my dress clothes and sports coat like I own the place! hehehe. The fun is just getting started!"

"event","I happened to be watching 'cbs news' don't ask me why! They told a cold statement that the military once again missed it's recruitment goal for the month and there stands the question Could there be a draft? Sadly, as the military is being strained with fighting wars on 2 fronts, both justified, will they need to reinstate it? I looked into the matter further and found this yahoo news entry that was posted June 12 and here's the link http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20050612/pl_afp/usiraqrecruitment_050612220625
*one correction I saw that was flawed.. the Death Toll for US troops is 1701, not over 1900*
Although our government has assured us that they wouldn't reinstate it, is that practical? My opinion is that it would be political suicide for anyone to ever do it, but should we just brush it off and say never? Now, just to get this stated, I Don't want posts saying if the wars were ethical and all that shit because it doesn't matter now. We are there and we have to get the job done. There is no question about that. This issue isn't political anymore about who's right or not. It's about what do we need to get the job done.. You gotta remember.. it's our generation over there fighting and if they need us to help, we shouldn't let them down. I mentioned the question at Eat N park in Natrona (i'm almost there every night around 930 so stop by sometime!) and our friend Andy said i'll move to Canada if they do.. I was very upset with him about that. I was thinking to myself.. let your friends and that go there and you'll just run away?? How could someone that enjoys our freedoms run away when those freedoms need to be protected??? You can't be patriotic and wave the flag and then abandon it when it needs you the most. If you can do that, then you shouldn't live here. I'd gladly go and fight if my President asked me to no questions asked. I'd remember what my grandfather John Kolich did during WWII. He lied about his age to be able to fight. Now, a flag flies proudly over his grave letting everyone know that he fought for our freedom. It makes me proud. Anyways, I keep rambling on, maybe it's because I had a little too much coffee tonight or somethin and typing helps me calm down for bed. Why I wrote this post was just to get your feelings on what's going on.. Do you think we could very well have a draft? Would you go or would you try to get out of it? Your thoughts please... Nothing slanderous or i'll delete it. Doesn't matter who would've won the election.. this isn't about that. It's about the war. Thanks."

"event","hmm.. Well, i'll explain the fun I had the other night. Tina, Marissa, and myself hung out with our great friend Char because she will be leaving soon for Georgia :( All i'll say is that we ate a lot of food and went to sleep early.. hehehe.. Great times..
Today, I watched the best of will ferrell vol.1 (which we finally found because it wasn't at any tape store besides Hollywood vid) and it was hillarious :)  ""I wish you weren't a liar"" and ""We could've sworn we heard Zeus laughing in the night sky"" and ""If the moon were made of barbeque ribs, would you eat it then? Hell, I'd have seconds!"" are in my head. Fun times again :) I miss you Jess :( It's not that much fun without you here :( You better plan to hang out with me all August!!

Well, the subject of 'choices' was because I have a choice... Now, I know what Jess and Marissa feel so they don't need to comment.. It's no to them, but other peoples' opinions are welcome. My mom was pondering with her doctor about getting gastric-bypass surgery because of her being overweight. She said to me that since I qualify for it, she'd pay the balance for me because 'i deserve it'. I mean, I'm def not bad like many people I know, but I still qualify for it. Heart disease runs rampant in my family.. I mean my dad just had an operation cause his arteries were clogged... Diabetes is also in the family and so on and so forth. To me, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get it done. I know someone has a bad story about someone who knows someone who had it done and all this crap, but i've personally met people that have had it done and they are a completely different person after it. It changes your life. 
Now, since Marissa has been opposed to me even thinkning about it, I told her i'd make a last ditch effort and i'd get a membership at the Y and work out and eat right and see how it goes. If I lose a decent amount of weight and I feel great and so forth, and my blood pressure isn't top-normal and my blood sugar drops from top-normal, then I won't consider the surgery because I won't need it. It's difficult for me because i've tried different diets and the weight just doesn't stay off. I'm kinda gettin sick of it. But, for Marissa and myself, i'll try again at it. The question I ask you is if it doesn't work, should I get the surgery? Now, don't just say you should be happy with who you are and all that cause I am happy with how I am, but I don't want to pay for it later since I am high risk for the problems I listed above and I want to get a change so I won't be in that top risk group anymore. I ask for your comments. I know the risks of getting it done, I mean every choice in life has risk involved, but I know the risks of not getting it done and the benefits of getting it done. I've done a lot of research because it is a big step. Let me know your feelings. 

*also, if you haven't noticed, I'm having this Elton John craze since I got his greatest hits CD. It makes me happy :) c ya. hehe"

I was tired during the day and had little to no energy. I just planned on dropping off applications at the fair that I had filled out. Then, I remembered that I didn't stop at the Kaufmanns booth the other day because I didn't feel I was prepared to go into an interview in case they'd give one. I didn't know if they would, but I went over. They said to fill out the application and come back and we'll talk with you. I turned it in. A tall man in a suit said let's go over here and talk. I must've did a decent interview because after it, he shook my hand and said would you like to work with us? I said that would be great and he said welcome to Kaufmanns you have a job. I left that place with such energy and smiled the rest of the day. I'm still excited about having a job and at a nice place :) I can't wait to start.

"event","On Saturday morning, May 28, 2005, I awoke to find my best friend Beauty (my lovebird) had passed away.
I had her since Nov. of 2001 and she was the best pet I've ever had. Today, Marissa and I buried her next to the tree in my back yard and then placed a rose from my rosebush on her grave. I buried her in my cedar box that I got when I bought a box of cigars. It was a nice box and I wanted to use it for her. 
It hurts to be in my room and for it to be quiet and her birdcage empty. I remember the times when I'd go camping for the weekend or was gone for the day and she was quiet until I walked in the door. She knew I was home and rang her bell and chirped. Most nights, i'd let her out of her cage and she'd fly over to my bed and keep warm under my covers, and if I forgot to let her out for that, she'd chirp really loud to remind me! I also remember the times when she was resting next to me on my shoulder and if anyone would come near me, she'd try to bite them as if to say don't mess with him. hehe. She would never let anyone touch her but me. If someone tried, she'd ruffle her feathers and try to bite them :)  I also remember that certain songs I'd play, she'd get into a real happy mood and dance in her cage and ring her bell on her pirch. I really miss her and she'll never be forgotten. All pets people have are all unique in some way. Not one pet is ever the same as the one that came before them. So, although I will save up to buy a new lovebird ($70), it'll never replace Beauty. I'm just glad I was there for her the last years of her life. Now, she'll rest in peace."

"event","well, I've had some great times these past couple days. A picnic one day, a road trip the next. Good times!
Although, my mom has been home a lot recently and all she seems to do is bitch bitch bitch. She argued with my dad and I today and then left. I had 2 anxiety attacks so far today and they're not fun. I'd describe them as having a fast heart beat, heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Not something that that I like to have. I haven't had one in awhile, but they seemed to just pop up. Being in this house doesn't help much. Although Marissa does her best to get me out, i'm still here a lot and there's not much I can do. It really sucks. I just wish she'd move out and do my dad and I a favor. I'll tell you what though.. if she keeps up her bitching and drinking, I'll have to '302' her myself and send her back to the ward where she belongs. All she does is spend my dad's money and then argues and argues all the time. She needs help. Obviously, she didn't get enough at the hospital. Also, with my dad being in a fragile state right now, he doesn't need it either. I don't know why he just doesn't leave her. It would be so easy. Why keep yourself in a bad situation when you don't have to?!? Is it money? What she's done to him she wouldn't get one cent. He could even take her truck if he wanted to since he bought it with part of his 401k money. For his health and my sanity, something's got to happen here. I just wanna scream out get the F out of our lives! Find someone who will take your shit because we can't anymore! Even her boyfriend on the side left her hahahaha. People may say why you talking about this in public. Well, you get what you give. I'm tired of being nice to her."

"event","During the month of may, it was the best and worst of times. The best, of coarse were when finals were over and I got to go home and see my bestest friend, besides Jess :P, Marissa. I also got to meet a great friend of hers Joe. A lot of other fun things have happened, but then there's the bad times.
Of coarse, like i've said in previous entries, my mom was in the hospital and that was a low point, all be it a small one, in my life. Then, just as you think things are getting back on track, another thing happens. One of my friends went to the hospital yesterday. He reached a low point in his life, but couldn't deal with the pain and tried to end it. He's ok now. I just wonder why he didn't call me to ask for my help. I would've been there. But, regardless of that, I'm here for him now. I went to visit him and brought him a bunch of things to make his stay alittle more bearable. I just hope that he learns that he doesn't have to go through life's sad times alone. I'm there for him. That goes for everyone else. I've been down in the dumps and back again. I know what it's like. My friends were there for me and they helped me get through it. Never keep sad things locked up inside. They won't go away. You need to talk about them and get them out of you. Isn't that what friends are for? I'm here.. I'll always be here."

"event","Well, finals are done. Another year has passed. I must say it has been an adventure to say the least. I met tons of people at the beginning with the elections. I almost shook hands with the pres cause I was so close :) I was a leader in a group with over 180 members. Awesome experience.
 Winter break came and I had to say goodbye for awhile to one of the greatest friends i've ever had, Jessica, as she took a long semester off to Argentina and I still won't see her till July :(  Then when I got back from break, not knowing at the time, was the greatest news I was gonna hear. I was movin out. Like I said in my previous entry. You gotta learn from the situation, then move on. That's exactly what i'm doing. I'll have my own place in the fall and I can do whatever I damn well please. I'll have my kinds of friends over and I'll do what I and my friends consider to be fun. I'm really looking forward to it. I must say I will miss one person from the apt and that would be Eric. He's a great person and has a bright looking future and I know he will be someone greater than he already is. I think we were the closest out the room mates. He's livin somewhere else too next semester, but I hope we keep in touch. He's one of those kinds of people you never want to forget.
 Another great person I met this past year was my buddy Todd that lived upstairs. I met him through Lisa and after that, everything was great. Through Todd, I hung out with other good people like jim and cody. I also met mark and jamie through him also. Great people. The last get together before we all left, I got to meet other good people like wes and Lisa's *friend adam. We have a great group of people formed I can tell and we told each other we'd see one another over the summer and definately in the fall. We'll have many good times together. 
Now it was the worst of times I say? How is that? Well, It had to deal with the situation at home. This past year, a family member has been sick and has tried to take their life 2 times. I tried my best to block it out of my mind and keep with my work so I didn't fall behind, but anybody whos anybody knows that I'm a worrier. It did bother me a lot. I wondered what I could do, if anything, to help. Luckily, I'm back home now and I can try to help things about as best I can so that their life will get better hopefully. Another issue was the sister issue which I already said enough about so i'll leave it as it is. But, that's pretty much it of the bad times. Nothing bad, thank God, with school!
I have many more things to talk about, but I don't like typing 5 pg. entries like some people I know hehe.
All in all, this was a good year. I did well in my classes and I met a lot of great people. Next year looks to be even greater than this one was. Of coarse, elections come by again and I get to play VP and help out which will be fun, but other than that, I'll finally be 21 so I can hang out at clubs and that with my older, more mature friends that I seem to have more things in common with than others I know. I'll be active in other clubs and i'll have a decent work load with classes so I'll be a busy guy :)  This summer, I plan to spend a good deal of it working, camping, random trips,  hangin out with friends, working out, and whatever else comes my way. I look forward to every bit of it. Well, this is where I end my entry. The people that read it are probably happy.. I am too believe me I'm about ready to pass out. hehe Take care all!"

"event","I went home for the weekend and made it here last night. What's very upsetting to me coming back is that I confirmed a rumor about my sister Tonya. She was sleeping with this man somewhere for a couple weeks and she got pregnant. Well, I wasn't aware of this and no one wanted me to know for fear that I would lash out like I will. She got an abortion and murdered an unborn child. It hurts just typing this that this child who did nothing to anyone and deserved a chance at life like anyone else was murdered. There's no other word to describe what took place. It was Murder allowed by our government, only because those fucks in the supreme court said its allowed. I've now excommunicated her from my life. I never want to be in the same room as someone that killed an innocent child because she wanted to fool around and did not want to deal with the consequences of her actions. God will judge her wihout mercy for what she has done. I do vow this though: I will use every last breath I have to make a change in this cruel world that we live in. I'll fight till I can not fight anymore to get this cruel ruling reversed so that defenseless children will have protection under the law so that the children have a right to live. This is one of the main reasons I am a republican. Women do not have the right to murder children. It is wrong. You just never realize how horrible abortion is until someone u know closely has it done and it breaks your heart to know that a child that would've looked up to you as their uncle never had a chance at living. Life is precious. I guess we'll never fully realize how precious it really is.

"event","Don't you hate it when someone close to you asks for your opinion, you give them it, then they do the exact opposite and they get hurt? Well, it makes me mad. I don't understand how someone could hope things will be better and keep trying and trying, regardless of how many times it has failed. One big step to maturity is being able to move on with your life. I'll be doing that when I move from my apartment and live somewhere else. I'll be moving on. You can't hold on to the past and try to make it work. The friends you had before may not be the friends you remember before. They too are moving on. Year after year, we become different people. We learn from our mistakes and it makes us a better person. I've made mistakes just like everyone has. The key is to learn from it and move on. I've known people that are so determined to make something work that really, in reality, has no chance of ever working. This brings me to the point that sometimes it doesn't hurt to listen to a friend's point of view on the subject. They are an outsider. Sometimes we grow blind of things because we don't want to face the cold hard reality. People that I meet that don't know how old I am think i'm older because of my personality and how I react to things. I've grown up so much faster mentally because of my experiences when I was young. I had to be the adult in my household and try to make things work. Having a mature attitude is why people always say i'm a great listener and great friend that they can always turn to for advice. Maybe because its raining and theres nothing to do is the reason why i'm rambling on about things, but I thought i'd talk about an issue that seems to effect a few people that I know. I hate to see when a friend is hurt. I don't want them to feel that way. Anyways, I better get going. Good luck on finals everyone and i shall see you over summer."

"event","Today was interesting. Unlike Tuesday, I got up for my classes today. I went to my 930 and guess what.. cancelled. Yay! Now i'm stuck in the library for an hour doing nothing because all of my work is done. It sucks. I'm now waiting for the slow clock to reach 11 so I can go to that class and that'll be it for me. 
I don't know what i'll be doing today.. I know Reese's friends are comin over to drink and that, but other than that, it's a usual day up here. I am looking forward to Friday. I'm planning to see the ring 2 with marissa and do other various things. Hopefully my buddy Sproull will stop up on Saturday. I know he'll like it here. Well, I must be going.. I need an 'after dinner mint' hehe. C ya."

Well, it's around 2 in the morning so I gotta get going. Everything is going a lot better than last entry. When I wrote it, I didnt take my meds for two days and was feeling out of it.

"event","Hey all. I got to spend my wonderful spring break back in new ken at my house. It's just as how I remembered it, boring and run down. Friends were unreachable, guess they're doin their thing like in high school. Noisy cars and fire whistles and trains sounding their horns at 3am. Ya, it's just like before. 
You know how being away from a city and friends from high school you think to yourself that it'll be great seeing your old friends again and seeing how the city is. Then you actually spend a week there and it seems like it was the worst week you've had in awhile? Maybe thats just me. I gotta honestly say that I love slippery rock the most. People you can depend on, friends that hang out and have a good time, and, the main thing, bettering yourself for the future ahead. I feel like i'm at a dead end when i'm here. Fake friends (not all.) and fake hopes. You'd have to be insane to want to stay in a town like this. Just walking around the block brings back memories that I'd hoped were forgotten. 
I can honestly say that I didn't make the most out of my life when I was living here. I didn't try enough in high school. I was never that social. I just stayed away from everyone and hoped for better days. Now, it's biting me in the ass. 
I went to Duquesne for the weekend to see Marissa and bumped into Sproull. He seemed so amazed on how much i've changed and it's been for the best. People that I made friends there with said that they haven't had that much fun in a long while. It made me happy. I only wished that the people that I went to high school with could see this side of me. But now, I sit alone typing in a journal while other people that I know visit their friends and spend time together. I can't say everyone did that. I was called up by ben and I went with him and zach to kings twice and hung out. That was nice. 
I just don't like being here anymore. I dread being here in the summer. If Marissa wasn't around, i'd prolly stay up at my apartment. There'd be no one there, but then again, no one's here for me either. At least i'd have a peaceful setting and I'd guess i'd even get a job at the university and work there. I dunno what I wanna do. All I know is this gloomy place has got to liven up. If not, all hope is lost."

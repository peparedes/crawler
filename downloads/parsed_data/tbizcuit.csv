"event","One, God bless our soldiers overseas. I will say this now and I will never change my stance on this subject. No more Vietnam syndrome this time people. Fuckin A! These men and women are over there fighting so we can enjoy our little selves over here. We have freedom folks. This is something some people have never, EVER known. Even if you disagree with the reasons, they are risking their lives so that we can happily stand in line at Starbucks. (some people are just mindless drones anyways) It makes me sick to read everyday how many lives are being lost. From both countries. Minus the terrorists of course. I cannot really ever condone the loss of life of any human being, as I cannot see us as being fit to judge who shall live and who shall receive justice. These extremist assholes however have no regard for the sanctity of life and we should all be better off without them roaming our planet. Amen US GI's. Two, Thanksgiving sucks out here. It is a major family function for the Ferraro's and one I shall not enjoy for the third year straight. I know what you're thinking...so don't come home during Christmas, come home now. One small problem...I'm in the middle of the quarter or I would. I will have my three week break then, and it just makes sense. So I don't really have any family out here, save for an aunt who refuses to recognize my existence, and a cousin (her offspring) who appears to share the same (lack of) sentimentality. See they live in Tucson, which is a whole hour and a half away. Yet they have not once come up here to visit me, or contacted me via telephone to invite me down. During the first year I was here, my uncle would have the decency to do that. He is pretty awesome actually and someone I admire and respect. However he has since taken a job at Lockheed-Martin in Fort Worth, Texas. We have much in common too, I do miss our chats. Anyway, it would be nice to at least get a hello from her, or her, once every now and again to show that the old adage is true. All you've got is your family. Hmm...sometimes. Well family and friends that do care...I love you tons and miss you lots. Please enjoy your time together this coming Thursday. Aunty Cathy you are always in my prayers. Mom, please settle things with Rita. It is killing you inside even though you are the most beautiful person I've ever known and are not at fault. Arrivederci."

"event","Well I haven't posted in fuckin ages and I find myself reading others...soooo maybe I should check in. I thought I would use this medium more often but what are you gonna do? I feel compelled to write in a particularly candid fashion during this entry. Sitting home this weekend, after making a few phone calls and returning a few made to me,then not hearing back from folks, I discovered that I have in two years made little if any true friends out here in Arizona. Maybe it is just my nature but I am inherently inclined to be good-natured and trusting of most I meet. I am not however naive. I guess I am just a little too sentimental, but what ever happened to people giving a shit about others. I've just about had it with the ""I'll call you yeahhhh definitely!"" and then I don't hear from people for like two weeks. I'm fuckin busy too. I just have enough courtesy and respect to deliver on my word. Let's not even get me started into female behavior which is especially nerve-wracking. I don't remember things being so difficult to understand or effective communication so futile. Of course the mentioning of names is irrelevant and I'm not taking ALLLLL females into consideration, just the ones that I seem to engage in apparently sparse acquaintance with. I consider myself a very upbeat, fun, gregarious person and I think that I give that vibe off, and unless there is a cross-continental, cultural contradiction going on, I thought that people out here would embrace my good qualities. Doesn't appear so. In some instances yes, but they seem to be short-lived or have too little impact to make a lasting impression. I guess I am on my soapbox today, so for those of you that don't know my paradoxical little quote, here it is ""I'm never in a bad mood unless I'm in a bad mood."" So for what reason do I build so few valuable relationships out here, romanic, friend or otherwise? Is it me? I tend to think not. I'm not fuckin perfect I acknowledge and can be a little sensitive at times but I am a genuinely good friend to have on your side. I have no idea what the future holds for me as far as my geographic happenstance, but I cannot see myself staying in an area where it seems people are only faintly interested in real, admirable qualities. For anyone that reads this and it makes them think about their current behavior, good, that's what it was intended for. My aunt Cathy is terminally ill with ovarian cancer and is seeking a last resort treatmant in the Bahamas. Please keep her in your thoughts if you could. She is the most delightful person and does not deserve such pain. Mom, Dad, Vron, Ed, Jared, Justin and all my family, I miss you terribly and love you all. Amy, it is absolutely ridiculous that you and I aren't talking. I pray that we resolve whatever issues we have before time passes and it becomes an impossibility. Irene, I hope your operation goes well and you are creating beautiful art again soon. Buona notte."

"event","I am home.
This rocks so much ass!
Merry Christmas to all!
It is cold. (Yay.....weird I know)
I like posting like this.
NYC here I come! 
Boston here I come!
I really hope it snows tomorrow instead of crappy-ass freezing rain, sleet whatever it's called shit.
I love my family to death!
My dog is 10.
Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is a remarkable film, but 45 mins too long.
I am going to go check my grades online, I hope they are good.
(Insert cheezy smile)
Goodnight all. Peace and happiness."

"event","Just a quick post. I haven't entered one in ages. I miss NY again. It will never cease. I must endure one more year of Arizona and I will back in my side of the pond. I don't know what it is, but I just really do not relate with most of the folks out here. They just have a different way about them. Don't get me wrong, I have met some fantastic people out here.....Brandon and Maya, I love you guys! Mondo, Matt, Aaron, Sarah, and my little dear Ashley. What makes me miss home so much? I have people here who care about me too!! Do I miss Amy? I cannot tell, the distance makes it hard to know. Would things be different if I lived there in NY still? She doesn't think that, but I was rather ambiguous for nearly two years, so she is a little weary. I don't know. I miss Dave, dude you are the funniest mo-fo ever..STILL! I miss Papa-Kid....I hope you are happy now dude. I miss Marc and Jamie and New Paltz...why am I such a sentimental fuck??!!!! DO these people really miss me? I sure fuckin hope so , because I so genuinely care. I miss Frank and hangin out on Saturdays, gettin KSW and the hot-ass peppa Carribean food! Shut up bitch!!!! I miss Gina, I haven't said that aloud (or typed it I know, so can it!!) in over two years. I truly hope she is happily married.
I miss my nephews SOOOOOO much. Justin is almost one...this blows. Mom and Dad, my pillars of strength. Veronica, you are the best sister EVER! I love you more than you know. Austin, Franz, the CC crew, I wish you the most success. December 21st will not come quick enough. Till then..."

"event","I have SOOOOO much HW to do in the next three weeks I believe if you could get a visual of what the inside of my head feels like, it would look like that Garbage Pail Kid - Adam Bomb. I just don't know where to start sometimes. It's pure, fucking folly. What an insane week. Sprint sucks ass. They shut my phone off last night and I had no advance warning. I called today to re-establish my frickin connection and inquired as to why I never get the god-damn bill. Ohhh let me check sirrr...... Well I see here that you have a bill hold on your account from like four months ago. Wonder why they never told me that the last 106 times I've asked them this. AARgghhh!!! So it's back on and whooptie-fuckin do! I have amad laundyr and shit to do, I'm just trying to actually prioritize for once. I suppose mayhaps I should head out for some detergent. More to come on this nightmare week...tune the hell in folks!"

"event","When....When I ask you did I begin enjoying sushi. I used to be that guy that went err...umm...I don't know. Get drunk one night at Crazy Fish and now I love the fuckin stuff. Annnd...we all know what you drink when you eat sushi, Sake Bombers! Oh lord truly good god's brew. But seriously folks, my financial philosophy is beginning to resemble the 80's Reagan administration...make less...spend more. Eating out is an addiction...SHIT!What to do, poor college student my ass! HAHA. Well I start this new cell phone-standing-in-a kiosk-at-the-fuckin-mall-feel-like-I'm-18-again job Tuesday. My friend Jason who recommended me for the position to his boss tells me he's doing well so I have high hopes. They seem to be of the pushy salesman caliber so I am still concerned I will fit in. I've left jobs like that before. Anyway there seems to be potential so I'm excited. Then I can make more..so I can go out again..so I can make more...so I can go out again...Arrgghhhh!"

"event","Holy shit. Upon leaving work the other day I realized that my VeeDub was low on fu-elll. So I did what anyone (and fucking everyone it appeared) would do and pulled into a Dan's Family Gas Station. There I was greeted with a smile by a man holding flyers. I proceeded to get out of my car when he stopped me, kinda freaked me out a little at first, and told me they had no gas! Aaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrghhh! Dude I'm gonna run outta fuckin gas! This sucks! Soorry he said and directed me with some crazy arm waving type thing toward another station. What he did give me...ooohh lucky me was a 2$ off coupon for a car wash. I think it expired today. So the deal is, you can't make it there anyway cuz you can't friggin buy gas. How lovely. It would really blow if this thing persists. I almost lost my temper at work today. I've been thinking about it ever since and I guess it's bothering me. A lady at work ordered salmon picatta for dinner. She ate about 99.44% of it, but it became clear that she wasn't about to pass this last morsel up. I brought a to-go box over to her ASAP.(they're white styrofoam boxes that fit an ENTIRE portion) When I get there and prepare to pack up her vittle, she shouts at me...""Don't you think I can get a bigger box..!"" There was like two peas and a 1/2 inch sliver of fish left. I thought she was insane before , but now I was just pissed. It was like she was implying that my spatial skills were non-existent. Lady it's a fuckin crumb!!!! Now don't get me wrong, I see people at work waste food all the time and it boils my blood but this was ridiculous. Anyhoo, I bit my tongue and brought her a HUUUGE god damn box that could've fit our entire salad bar. She put her food in it, appearing much happier that she wasted plastic. I laughed. she heard. oh well. Had an awesome time last night with Mon, Ali and Friends. Mon told the story of the Circus Strong Man. My god I think I've never laughed so unbelievably hard. File it under..""had to be there"" Mon, you rule and your apartment rocks. Bitch! haha Good night folks. 3D animation class is beckoning me. Ciao."

"event","I have a lot on my mind right now. I am really missing NY right now. I'm actually reading all my friend's LJ's to see what they're up to. This 3 hour difference fucking sucks! Happy Birthday to my boys Kione and Mike who both share Saturday as their special day. Miss ya guys! It rained tonight...it rained, it rained , oh how it rained. It hasn't rained in like a god damn year! This state is insane. It is so damn hot during the afternoon that a mere tappity tap-tap tapperoo on the steering wheel and your hand becomes bonded to it like some epoxy. WTF?! Anyway the lightning was really amazing and honestly AZ has some phenomenal sunsets people. Still up in the air about my future residence however. I guess I'll have to see where my career leads me. As I was saying to the Mon the other day, (with which he agreed with me on) there are only 2 states in the US of A. New York and California. I've never been to CA and I'm really looking forward to it. The film industry will probably lead me there so I hope to enjoy it. My World Lit teacher let us out like wayyyy early today, so much that even I (who would normally not complain) was like WTF?!! Soo...here I am in front of this huge square..typing...still.. I'm supposed to go out tonight and listen to some good House but I'm starting to lose the urge. My roommate Zack is bringing some crazy chick so I'm going to feel like a (for you Trixieo) douchebag. I'll not stay long though and see some cool peeps so it will be all good. That's it for now. Ciao.."

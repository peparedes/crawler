My plans to start a biz in CA are on the rocks, due in part to the economy, and in part to the reality of 'regulations', and the related expenses.  Not dead yet. But on the rocks.

Last weekend the third batch of wedding mead did NOT get bottled. After a few hours in the warmer temps, it decided to keep on bubbling.
Decisions decisions.. do I squelch the fermentation with chemicals or let 'er bubble for a week in these high temps... I decided to let 'er bubble.
Doubt it will be done by the end of the week. 

It's been going for 5+ months. Should be done. 
Going to bottle this weekend anyway. Without chemicals. *keeping my fingers crossed*

Well Pennsic prep has not really begun yet. Guess I should drag out the checklist and start pulling out the basic gear. In the next couple of weeks I am going to be just a LITTLE nutz. Looks like the Sin Pit finally got ""back"" to E5. My first time. Should be interesting.

Should be able to finish the forging on the rail spike knife and do some annealing prior to the grinding. Planning to use <a href=""http://www.atar.com/old/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=24&MMN_position=33:21"">Master Atar's formula</a> for hardening/tempering such a beast. Man, I can't wait to throw it on an SCA field.<br /><br />Gearing up for another visit out west. This time will be checking out: http://www.harbin.org/<br />"

"event","Ok, well now that most of the ice has melted outside, I'm ready to gear up for some major blacksmithing.
Collecting more goodies and hoping to have a get together within a few weeks for those who want to play.

Maybe by then I'll have a start on those bellows.

Also, collecting goodies for all-grain brew party. Wondering what it would be like to mingle the office crew with the SCA brewers at my place."

I have dragged myself out of my writer's block by no small amount of effort and I finally have something to show for it!  It is in its early stages, and I need a beta reader or volunteer reader to bounce it off of before I continue.  It's a little different stylistically from what I had done in <i>Vanilla</i> or <i>Vertigo</i> and I want to get a good base reading before I finish a doomed project.

Come on, you know you want to get an inside view on this--it's gonna be good!

cheers

"event","A few days ago, I posted a request for plot bunnies on the <lj user=""jou_loves_kaiba""> conference, hoping for some spark to get me back into writing.  I got four replies.  Out of the four, there were only two that I really liked, so I picked those and added one of my own that's been percolating for a little while.

So here's my challenge to myself: to have these three fics done, betaed, edited, and posted by January 1st.

And here's the challenge to my readers (all two of you ^_^): pick one of these three plot bunnies and give it your own go, and then send it to me so I can post it here as well *transparent desire for this to become a fic journal*.

Good luck!

1. From <lj user=""kasumi_blue"">:

Hmmm... I guess this could be humor OR fluff. But I was thinking a Christmas fic where Kaiba's not much into the Christmas spirit until Jou helps him a bit? You can take the helps part any way you want, but I don't think this one needs to be above PG-13. And one more thing... Kaiba getting visited by three Christmas ghosts? XD Three Christmas magicians?


2.  From <lj user=""sarasusa"">:

Teenage!Mokuba has shown a surprising aptitude for programming and development; he accepts an enticing offer from the Mikage Seminar at elite Ohtori Academy. Shortly after he transfers there, though, his communications with his brother either turn odd or just trail off altogether. Kaiba goes to investigate. Whom should he bump into en route, however, but Jounouchi...(you come up with the reason why! Shizuka's enrolling? Jounouchi's taken up fencing?

3.  My own:

HIstory has a way of repeating itself, but what if it didn't?  What if there was always one common element that would take Kaiba Seto two lifetimes or more to connect?  At the end of it all, who does he stay with?  Beginning with Ancient Egypt, go through Kaiba's various relationships until he ends up (or not) with Jou.

<i>You can dance 
Ev'ry dance with the guy 
Who gives you the eye 
Let him hold you tight
You can smile 
Ev'ry smile for the man who held your hand 
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's taking you home 
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmmm


Oh, I know (oh, I know)
That the music's fine 
Like sparkling wine 
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing 
But while we're apart 
Don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home 
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me, mmmm</i>"

"event","<i>Two Step</i> is finally, finally underway.  I have it mostly plotted out--next step is an outline and then I can start writing it for real.  So, if anyone wants to beta a Joukai sequel, then let me know.

What I've been doing in preparation for writing what is essentially my biggest fic challenge yet has been to go over and through all of <i>Rescue</i>, and, actually, that's the reason for my update here.  I've edited the first six chapters so far, and I've made rather large changes to chapters 3 and 6--in 3, I've added dialogue at the business meeting as well as in Seto's outside phone calls, in order to create a more realistic business crisis.  With these changes, I think the story is much clearer as to both <i>why</i> Diamente tried to hack KaibaCorp's accounts, <i>how</i> they did it, and just why Kaiba's reaction may or may not be overly harsh.  These are all extremely important to the plot of <i>Two Step</i>, but the chapter needed to be edited anyway.  The writing is also clearer.

In chapter 6, I've cut the entire original kiss scene and the way it was led up to--I hadn't meant to, I was just adding some dialogue and trying to clarify Joey's POV and it turned into this power struggle between a confused, still sick Kaiba and a Joey who refuses to be goaded by old insults.  Perhaps I'm trying to make Joey grow up too much, but I think it's still in character for him--but then, I've always been inclined to give his intelligence and maturity more of the benefit of the doubt than a lot of others in this particular 'ship.  And I'd like to think that if he ever got the upper hand, he wouldn't abuse it.

These new chapters will be up on ff.net once I've totally finished editing, along with the first chapter of <i>Two Step</i>, which I'll add to the end of <i>Rescue</i> to let people know there's a sequel out, finally.

It's taken me long enough, right?  I mean, it's only been, what a year since I wrote <i>Rescue</i>?  *grins*"

"event","Happy Birthday Seto!  Sorry I've no present for you this year, I'm being cheap.

Lorrie, you're going to want to skip this entire entry, since it is almost entirely about things you have no interest in.

Also, in the interest of not boring people who couldn't care less, as well as not taking up space, I will now invoke the marvel of the fake lj-cut.  Musings on shipping underneath the cut.


<lj-cut text=""Fake cut for your convenience"">

That said, I've gotten very bored with sitting around being sick here, so I've been killing time reading a bunch of fics and I'm very amused at the pairings I prefer.  Firstly, I'm amused that I almost always go for the slash pairings--I suppose that's ingrained reaction from when the best writers wrote slash, so in order to get a good story, you would have to deal with the whole homoerogenous thing, but that's really no excuse.  

And then, having more time on my hands, I found myself comparing my two favorites, Joukai and Roy/Ed--similiar, but different in a few important ways.  So I decided to put them down to kill some time since I'm not actually sleepy yet and, on the off-chance I start writing FMA fics, well, I'll have wanted to put it <i>somewhere</i>, yes?

So.  Both involve fiery, hot-tempered, sometimes immature, often heroic, pretty-enough-to-be-girls blonde boys, and both involve smug, self-satisfied dark-haired blue-eyed men who are obsessed with power and the mistakes in their past.   Right.  Now, I think I'm drawn to Roy/Ed (or at least, <i>well-written</i> Roy/Ed) because it has a lot of the qualities I wish Joukai would have, such as an actual respect for each others abilities; the ability to tease and not take it as a life-or-death insult; while there is angst, it is not of the teenage ""I must win the game because my sister/brother/other half is looking to me for guidance"" variety--in short, it is more grown-up, and I appreciate that.  

Don't get me wrong, Jou and Kaiba were my first yaoi loves and I've no doubt they'll stick with me till the bitter end (or I get too old and embarrassed to write fanfics anymore), but there's something very tempting about Roy and Ed--more like I would imagine Jou and Kaiba to be five or ten years from now.  I like the age dynamic between them; like Joukai, I like the continual battle for dominance; I like the OBVIOUS sexual tension in the series (sometimes being a Joukai shipper makes me want to cry...there's just so little <i>canon</i> proof, y'see); and it doesn't hurt that both Roy and Ed are damned sexy.  And Roy is <i>normal</i>.  He isn't psycho, or mentally unbalanced, or obsessed with much more than becoming Fuhrer, which is actually for the good of the country.  I heart Seto, but he drives me a little nuts, unless I'm writing angst.  Then he's a walk in the park, but something like <i>Vanilla</i>, for example, was ridiculously hard to write without him going insanely OOC.  I think I kept him fairly well in character, but that was mainly through an insane amount of revision and editing.

And then there are the plot possibilities.  It doesn't have to be romantic!Roy/Ed, as many writers have pointed out, FatherFigure!Roy works almost as well.  Plus, think of all the missions you could send Ed on!  And the Ed rants!  They'd be more interesting to write than getting-old-quickly dog comments.

Of course, in defence of Joukai, they have a certain passion that I'm not sure too many other couples can achieve.  I think it's amusing how I go for the couples that fight and have more use for insults than for petnames--like Vash/Wolfwood, Jou/Kaiba, Roy/Ed, Vash/Meryl, Juri/Ruka, Utena/Touga, etc.  Not surprisingly, it is actually a <i>very</i> good indication of what my own love life is like.

But the point I'm trying to get at is that these pairings are just more interesting.  I like a fluffy dark!Yugi/Yugi fic as much as anymore, but give me a well-written Jou arguing with Seto and nothing makes me happier.

Anyway, rant done.  I actually had something intelligent I was going to write earlier, when I first started thinking about this a few days ago, but I can't for the life of me remember.  Probably because I was delirious with fever at that point.  Anyway.  Off to find some more fics...

</lj-cut>

Note to self:  No writing a new fandom until <i>Two Step</i> is at least halfway finished.  In other words, never.  Sad.  I need inspiration."

Not that I'm complaining that all I want to do is sit around and write fics and read fics, but I'm in <i>Ireland</i>, for Chrissakes.  I feel like I'm wasting my time.

Well, I'll go traveling this weekend, definitely.

And, yes, I need a beta.  All my old ones seem to have, um, disappeared (I'm not mean to betas!  I swear!  We just lost touch).

Of course, the only good thing that's coming of this insomnia is the plot to the sequel to <i>Rescue</i>, which, oddly enough, has most of a plot but still lacks a decent title.  Hmm.

<i>Two Step</i> (working title):  Sequel to <i>Vertigo</i> (<i>Rescue</i> at ff.net).  In the aftermath of vertigo.  Kaiba Corp hosts a competition, Jou wonders about Kaiba, some one is out for revenge.

<i>Birthday Presents</i>: A two-parter.  The first half is told in flashback, the second as it happens.  My hypothesis on what could have happened between Legendary Heroes and Battle City.

<i>Club 1</i>:  Jou and Seto at a nightclub.  Plot bunny that I had to cage.

<i>Somnabulist</i>:  <i>Club 1</i> from a YY/Y point of view.  Yugi at the club and what happens after.

<i>Blue Skies</i>:  A Trigun/Cowboy Bebop crossover.  Because I can.  ^_^

Also, some all-dialogue pieces and one really grueling Harry Potter project.  More on those as they come."

"event","So, I've finally, <i>finally</i>  finished <i>Vanilla</i>.  Five chapters came from this one-shot idea that I started way back in November, and it seems to be pretty popular, which is nice.

More news:  ff.net is being a bitch, as per usual, so while I put the final verion up there, I've also opened a mediaminer.org account.  Go <a href=""http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_st.php/68572/"">here</a> to read <i>Vanilla</i> as the one-shot it's meant to be.  Also, although I HAVE finished the story, there is an epilogue in the works, just to polish it off and give it a bit more of an ending.

Finally:  I'm taking a bit of a break from Joukai.  No, not a huge one, seeing as that's what I spend most of my time writing, but I have a couple other projects in the works, namely a Harry Potter fic and a Cowboy Bebop/Trigun crossover, both of which are turning out to be fairly complex and will take up most of my time and efforts.

For those of you who are wondering, the sequel to <i>Rescue/Vertigo</i> is also in the works.  I hope to have it mostly finished by the end of September."

Who knows, I may even be able to update once a week.  Or something.

Also, I have two people so far interested in illustrating <i>Vanilla</i>...Darkmus and this girl from Indonesia who doesn't speak English very well but has a really sweet Kaijou that fits perfectly with the storyline...we'll see.  I think I'll give both of them the option to illustrate a certain scene, and see what comes of it.

If there are any others interested, let me know (she says to the non-existent readers of this journal)."

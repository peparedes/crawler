"event","HELLO!!!!!!
wow it's been a while. i don't even remember the last time i wrote. i know..thats sad. But hey, im writing now so it's ok. Well..i dont know what to say now. ok so now im going to Poinciana High. and no..i still haven't gotten my shoes yet. i better get my shoes! mtv is gonna hear it from everyone if they dont get their shoes. I'm looking for a job. i only applied for burger king so far. but ill get there. CVS and Walgreens is next . Mickey D's too (theyre hiring). i'm very excited im graduating. im a little nervous at the same time. it's going to be a very awkward time. Both families will be there. my dad and step mom and my mom and my step dad. which will be awkward at least for me. I always said to my self there's only going to be 2 times in my life this will be awkward. Graduation and the day i get married. it's hard . who's gonna walk me down the aisle? my dad? or step dad ? my father , well he's my father. But i've lived with my step dad since i was itty bitty. i love them both so much. who's gonna be my brides maids mom's side or dad's? JUST THINK! the receptioon! everyone will be separated. you see what i go through? lol i haven't even had my first boyfriend yet. (as much as people want to say things richard doesnt count) 

Anyways speaking of guys... yea nevermind there's no guys lol. there's guys that i think are cute but that's a different day. but anyways im going to see amittyville this weekend hopefully. i saw Sin City we snuck into it cuz i had no ID (i know stupid stupid me) but it was a good movie.i liked it. 
wow i wrote alot i guess ill write some other time. i almost wrote a book. lol
ok PEACE!  remember HUGS NOT DRUGS! lol( that's a shirt that i saw which im getting very pronto) ok forreal bye . (music its what im listening to, that's why i wrote it)"

"event","today was alright , at least i got out of the house. Shanta came over for alittle bit and we decided to do something. so then we thought about renting a movie and going to someones house and also getting pizza. so i called Chris to let him know and he said he would call mel and julie cuz jen was working. then he wanted to invite johan so he wouldnt be the only guy...again. hehe. so he called 3 way but his mom said he wasnt home. so we were like alright . Chris came with mel and julie and we were gonna go to shantas and last minute vanessa calls tosay she was able to go . so she said she would meet us at hollywood movie thing. so we left and we were looking for a movie .. we were there for about an hour before we finally decided that there were no good movies. poor vanessa was waiting in shantas house for who knows how long. so we get pizza and we go to shantas house . it was cool we just hung out until about 930 and we went home. that was pretty much it.
O yea and my sisters foot was run over by shanta..hehe
its funny. nothing really happened she just cried alittle . shes a tough cookie i knew she would be alright. but the end of the night she was jumping all over the place playing that one game DDR. 

no ones online and im sooo hyper. this is your fault shanta. lol"

"event","i dunno when the last time i wrote in this thing. this weekend my mom wasnt home she went to some retreat thing. Friday was church and well nothing really happened.Vanessa actually went to youthgroup and she went to eat with us after wards too. but she got in trouble for comin home so late. (actually compared to other times friday we got home early)yea i feel like something else happened ..but maybe not. alright so saturday after being home for a while we went to Sonias house to eat. which was cool. and from there we were suppose to meet up with shanta and go to see a movie or something. but plans changed when Vanessa wasnt allowed to go. so then chris told me they were going to Blanchard park the guys were gonna play soccer and we were gonna have a cake for Tio Nelson. we only had an hour and a half before they closed the gate. after that we went to Leti's house. and we stayed there for a while.and when we actually were about to leave to eat some ice cream my stepdad said it was too late  to do anything. so i couldnt go but chis and jen went. i hear the next day that they stayed up till 3 or 4 in the mornin . they were playing Monopoly with alex and ronald.so that sucks that i missed out. then sunday went to church and went to eat at Cici's .. after that i shouldve gone with the guys to go bowling even tho i wouldnt have bowled. i actually thought maybe theyll go to my aunts house and from there well go to Boardwalk. but that didnt happen. i went to Tia Paulina's house and it wasnt too bad . alex,mel,julie,ronald,ana and me played Uno for alittle bit. it was funny. then we just watched tv. after that we went home and my mom also came home that night."

"event","today ..was great...
i think by the time we actually reached the school we had maybe 5 minutes.. probably ..just guessin. i went to my locker and was heading for my 1st per...and the bell rings.
i walk in  3 seconds after the late bell rings. and i sit down . 2 or 3 other people were also late ..and then the teacher told all of us to get a pass..but ..they were giving out detentions today..greeat. so i got a detention for 2morrow. but anyways.. i dunno wats up with me 2day ..im alittle out of it. 
ok so my dad got his biopsy thing done on monday ..i think..and got his results yesterday ..or tuesday, turns out that the little bumps on my dads neck is cancer. its wierd tho he didnt really talk to anyone of us about it. its like he doesnt want to upset us or anything, but the day that mari and ruben came over he just said it ..to mari..saying to tell her dad to pray. 
still..its kind of weird he doesnt wanna talk about it with us. im alittle scared ..we dont know how dangerous or not it is. hopefully its nothing ..and maybe surgery will get it removed. still its gonna be alot of money cuz my dad has no insurance so yea..
so i dunno how the hell im gonna pay that freaking cell bill i can believe i went $80 over. im not too convinced it was me, we'll see tho."

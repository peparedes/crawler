"event","hmm for some reason someone has inspired me to actually start writing in here again.. go figure.. hmm past week has been pretty adventuress. wednesday me kittie aaron and bridgette went to disney trippin.. it was fun but crazy as well i had no sence of direction.. and i love all the things acid shows me.. but i hate that it lasts forever and sometimes is just blah. thursday night i left work an hour early and went and got glowsticks and headed to Universal and waited for Haley, KC, Jeff and Matt. They were a little late. at first i thought they already went in the park :[ and I didn't have my phone because i left it on the monorail at disney (they're sending it in the mail now. I had fun but of course got kind of sad when the beans wore off. sto0pid memoriez >;l and today i left work at 11 because i needed to go get my social security card which took like 3 hours. I ended up going home and eating lunch and chilling on the computer for like an hour.. I got back and they were on 156 and i was 148. The security guard was nice enough to let me in line when he actually made a few others grab a new number. Guess it was my lucky day. I originally got there at like 11:35 or so and didn't leave till about 3 :\ I then left torwards Disney to come to find out they had already mailed my phone yesterday. So it was a waste of gas and time. Come home to find out that my 400 gig harddrive I ordered was apparently delivered to someone at this address. My brother didn't get it and he states that my crackhead cousin was around here when it was taken. Had an argument with my grandmother because she protects him no matter what happends. I do believe he took it and I will find out Monday if the person the UPS guy handed it to is bald or not.. If So I'm not going to lie for him like my grandmother asked my mom to when her pills were stolen and he was caught with them. I just don't understand people. Tomorrow I don't really got plans after work so I guess I'm just going with the flow. Month and 2 days til the new apartment. I'm quite excited :D Recently I've been agitated by little things. I don't know why. Works going well. anyways.. tis night time. good night"

"event","so yeah I had Sunday off, most of the day I cleaned then headed over to Terry's house to play prey, and worms 4, Jenn jumped in worms for a few games. Twas fun. Then we headed to Taco Bell where Terry decided he wanted to be slick and put my straw into a full pack of Fire sauce while I was up at the counter, my mouth was burning :[. After that I we went back to Terry's and from there I went home. Yesterday I went and saw Miami Vice, the whole movie sucked up until the end where there was a big gun fight. I definately won't see it again thats for sure. On the way home  I stopped at Walgreens to say hi to everyone :D Hmm now I'm off to work shortly and for some reason I'm still way tired... but I'm sure I'll make it through the day.."

I headed torwards Terry's because he got off work at 6:30, ate there then headed to citywalk with Terry, Jenn and lil chris and i played ddr and such. We then headed over to the wyndham resort to go to AFO's little rave/dance. It started off gay because they were playing horrible music then like 20 minutes into they started playing good techno. Circles were forming and people were getting there chance to rave, I ended up going in the circle like 4 times, brought all my glow stuff including the glowballs. There was so many glowsticks in there it was crazy. Jenn ended up going in the circle once and actually was the shit ;D. We left around 1:30 and headed home. Was quite a night to say the least, today we might go back to AFO or maybe to the beach :] who knows..."

"event","Hmm Today was my first day at Brighthouse and it was actually quite enjoyable. My trainer is nice and the day went by quick. I've definately realized this is the place for me, they'll pay for any class i take as long as i pass it and its a computer course, and its super easy to move up in the company. Brighthouse has a shitload of awesome benefits and am so glad to be working there. Halfway through our class we got moved to a different building down the street until Friday because there was a group of 30 installers needing to be trained and our class was only like 12 or 13 people. Theres alot to learn but we have 5 and a half weeks to learn it all. For the next month and half my schedule will be Monday-Friday 8:30-5:30 and after that I'll be working 1-10, we get an hour lunch, plus I'll get paid 40 cents more since my shift runs after 5pm. I'm loving everything about it and its a good company to work for. After work I left to meet up with Terry and Jenn and went to a few stores then ate at Burger King and came home and cleaned and such, now its night time and such so I'm getting ready for bed. Hopefully tomorrow goes as well as today has. pz"

"event","Hmm so last night Terry, Jenn, Chris, and big Chris came over, we got pizza and shit and had a lil lan party (nerd life).. played till like 3 or so and everyone but lil Chris left. Went to bed around 5 and woke up around 11am. I cleaned my room while lil Chris was still sleeping, did some laundry ya know the usual Sunday shit. When he woke up we ran up to krystals came back and chilled for a little while waiting till 8 to go see Clerks 2. The movie was the shit, I laughed harder then I've laughed in awhile it was definately funny and quite suprising. After that Terry and I played some DDR then headed to Taco Bell. I saw an old friend crossing the street and yelled at him, apparently he had just been in a car accident with a friend and was walking to the hospital to see her because she broke her leg so I gave him a ride real quick. After that I met with Terry and Jenn at Taco Bell and Terry won us a shit load of food with that lil game that you drop coins in the water and try to land on the little platform, he won 2 soft tacos and a burrito. We bullshitted for a little while then I heard a kitten meow, I saw it in the bushes it was so cute it was grey and white I tried going torwards it, I wanted to keep it but that lil fucker was fast and disappeared into the darkness, I was gunna name him chillito if it was a boy and chillita if it was a girl.. since I was at Taco Bell and all. After that I had to give Chris a ride home and I just got home. I start my new job tomorrow and its supposed to be a breeze for the first few weeks, I have a month and a half of training. So I think I'ma go to bed. Night :D"

"event","Hmm So I decided I'd like to go back to keeping a collection of whats going on in my life. Alot has gone on since the last post but I'm only going to mention whats gone on from a few months ago.. Fell in love with the girl of my dreams,  alsneglected to get drugs out of my life, and lost her. I focused to much on being a boyfriend and lost the bond we originally had and has been the worst thing that has ever happend to me. Shes now moving away to Kentucky and I hope the guy shes with treats her like gold because its what she's worth. I've just recently got a job at brighthouse and have a plan to get an apartment with my friends Jenn and Terry, who have always been here for me but i kinda ventured away when i got into the drug scene. Drugs definately have made me have bad judgement and have been quite an illusion of ""fun and good times"". I'm done with them for hopefully forever and I hope I can get my life back to where I want it. I hope to stay in contact with my exgirlfriend Haley and hope we can eventually have the friendship we use to have. I kinda feel like this is all a fresh start to me but I hate I've already lost my bestfriend. For the time being I'm just going to get job shit straight, get an apartment, get my learn on at school and hopefully move up in the company. I'm probably going to be seeing alot less of my ""old friends"" since I don't really want to be around people who are ""getting fucked up"" as I use to do every weekend. I'm almost off probation so things are probably gunna start looking up. About a week ago I went to the gathering of the juggalos with Haley and had a good time and had this revelation as every part of my life in the past months begin to make since and I wish I would have paid attention to the things life teaches you like I use to be good at doing before I got into drugs. I had fun for the 2 years of partying but kinda don't regret it because I actually learned alot from drug use. I'll now be working with my bestfriend from high school which will be the shit. I've got alot of goals I want to reach that I think will actually be realistic to me now and just not dreams. For the past few months I've been in Lakeland spending whatever time I could with Haley, and the rest of my time going to work. I hope from here on out I continue to make good judgement and things slowly start to work out and get better. Me and my mother are slowly starting to get the relationship back that we use to have, and soon want to try to better my relationship with my father. I got another cat, his name is Papi, but not by choice.. I didn't wunt muh kitty to go through an identity crisis or some shit so I kept the name. He's all white and loves attention, he tries tripping you when you walk down the hall and is good at it. My other kitty is still very loving and I luh her to death, she gets me through tough times :D. I met a bunch of wonderful people in Lakeland and hope to see some of them again as well. As for the living situation currently, they're always fighting going on between my mother and my grandma, and most of it is because my cousin is leaching from my grandma and my grandma is taking up for him and hes honestly a horrible person and a peice of shit, but he'll get whats coming to him. there was a big gap from my last post but I'm going to try to stay current with my journal because I always love looking back at old shit and seeing what happends. Tomorrow I think I'm going to sleep in then read some of the Brighthouse book Terry gave me and maybe go play some DDR, then finally take Lil Chris home. I start at 8:30 Monday and I'm hoping I'm prepared and everything goes well. I'm glad I've gotten alot of the negativeness out of my life and hope to keep it that way. I've learned so much from Haley and am thankful for her, and one of her main mottos is ""fuck the bullshit"". It's a good way of keepin control of yer life and not letting other people influence it. I'm all about bettering my character and becoming a better person."

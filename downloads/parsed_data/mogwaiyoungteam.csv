lazed about and watched the football in my bed over some live stream. still feeling a bit under the weather coz of this cold. had a bath, and moped about.

ruth's in vegas on holliday at the moment :( i miss her 

i am a pure gay. i sat in on my own and watched chocolat.

heading over to the maw's tomorrow to borrow her car. i'll have it for 2 weeks, YAY!

my head seems a lot better these days, which is good. i'm not going back to the doctor about it :)
he's rubbish anyway and threatened to put me on anti-depressants. BAD!

the knee seems to be getting a lot better, so i'm planning on starting running again, and hopefully i'll be back playing football again soon.

4 gigs in the coming 4 weeks, so i'm looking forward to that.

tomoro is a day for tidying and doing a wash. domestic bliss!

should probably go to sleep.

<b>What is STFU Glasgow?</b>
STFU Glasgow is a 3 day music festival now running for its second year, which is part of the larger stfu network that has arranged festivals and gigs in towns and cities across Europe. The aim of Stfu is to showcase up and coming electronic musicians, djs and visual artists. The event brings together people from all over the globe who make many different styles of music in many different ways.

It kick's off tonight, and i'm hoping to make it over to see some acts i've heard a lot of good things about. and it's FREE, which is always a bonus.
the link at the top takes you to the homepage which has maps and running times, and also info on the acts playing the weekend.


personally i can't wait for my set on sunday night, as it looks like it could be a really good weekend.

"event","<b>1. Do the drugs make you happy or are they a cover up for low-ness?</b>
Oooft. that's a rather heavy question to kick of with. Well i suppose it's a bit of both. I do feel quite down a lot at the moment and going out and getting mad wae it helps. but at the same time, even if i feel really good, i really enjoy getting mad wae it. And the fact that there's usually hunnners of my mates out with me, and we're out having a great laugh. i went out lots and lots during the 2 week detox and i did have a lot of fun, but i knew it would be just a wee bit better if i wasn't detoxing.

<b>2. When have you been the happiest?</b>
i don't know when i've been the happiest of late, but i know the most contented i've been in the last wee while is when i just wandered away from a party or something and sat on my own watching the world go by. i quite like sitting in my wee bubble watching the world pass me by. just understanding that on the grander scale of things we mean absolutely nothing, and accepting it. i don't like thinking about things a lot though. i tend to get confused by things.

<b>3. Do you enjoy being single?</b>
nah. my head's totally fucked up at the moment. and even if it wasn't, i do have the pulling power of a coma victim. FACT. but it's something i grew used to after 19 years of it. heh.

<b>4. Do you like boys?</b>
No. Contrary to popular beleif i am not a homosexual, i am not a drug dealer, and i do not have special needs.

<b>5. If I asked you to close your eyes and hold out your hand, would you do it willingly?</b>
Yeah."

"event","saturday - Death disco + 3 litres of asda red bull + 1 can red bull = sore heart. manhattan project were good. but headliner justus konche was utter shite. he played slow disco and house and couldn't mix at all. it was a really bizarre DD all round. although it was a great laugh being out with my mates.

sunday - ended up killing off the detox and heading to POPTIMO. met john, lucy, holly, frew, slevin who were still going from saturday night. had muchos fun. went to holly's mate jessica's wee brother's flat. tenious link indeed. met some really sound new folk. got more fucked up. drank hunners of vodka. it quickly became monday.

monday - went on an underground adventure to see a dog owner. went back to the flat and partied more. went to the brunswick cellar's for a drink and then i was going to get the train home. holly's mate couldn't make Hot Chip so i got a free ticket. headed to the arches where i got uber searched. they found no nonsense on me ^-^ and in i eventually got. holly's mate jessica, who'd not taken anything all day, had her bag emptied, and they found a half in a filter tip pack. and then there were 3. the sound and the crowd for hot chip were shite. you couldn't drink whilst watching the band either. and me, john and holly must have been the only 3 folk dancing in the whole place. went to macsorley's after for a quick drink. everything hit me at once and for 5 mins i felt completely monged. then jumped on the last train with holly and walked home.

today/tuesday - slept. woke up, pottered for an hour, then returned to bed. accies won 3-1 so we're joint top, and celtic won 3-0 too. i burned my rice and when i was running down to the kitchen to see what was burning i took a chunk out the base of my heel. just about to have a bath.

i start work tomorrow doing PR for XFM, at the AFI gig at the barras. really looking forward to it.
need to go for a wander down hamilton with some CVs. Need job.

generally i'm quite confused by things as a rule. and at the moment i'm trying my best to understand what's going on in my head. sometimes one thing will push me in one direction, then the next minute the same thing will pull me the other way. it's extremely frustrating for me, and everyone around me.

meh.

I LOVE TECHNO on saturday.

what happened this weekend?

got home today to find a letter from XFM and i have a new job! whooray!

fuck sake, i did the ryan smith drug rant this morning. argh.

Cheers erin.

the whole weekend merged into one big blur of munt for me.

things i can actually remember:

edingburgh being a pure shite place.
a bit massive lorry being IN the street round from the venue.
pissing out the kobai bus as rab speeds along the m8.
a pots and pans rapture cowbell collective that got the polis phoned.
8am booze run.
another destruction of charlotte's flat.
another pair of boxers ruined. (and me showing everyone)
randomly busting into tears in the living room for no reason.
having to sit in the bath whilst someone took a shit.
kirsten's fucking topper of a punch.
there were HUNNERS of gayers. two of them were fighting all the way from camphill to that crazy anne's flat. it was fucking hilarious.
said crazy burd nearly getting killed by a truck.
missing the train 3 times.
finding pills constantly about my person.
much talk of feltching, babpiping and general buggery.
getting back to my house today and taking my sock off and discovering ANOTHER white tablet of happiness.

the walk of shame was actually not too bad today. i think it was because it was a sunday for once and hamilton was dead.

i think i'll no doubt be awake for the next few hours doing fuck all.

ho hum.


No poptimo tonight unfortunately, as i am a poof and can't handle a 4 day bender this weekend.

cheers everybody, especially nicola for sitting talking to me for ages when i did my now weekly ""andy goes completely sideways for an hour or so""!"

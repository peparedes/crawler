"event","death:
its on of those things that you cant really grasp the concept,  but when you expearence it personaly it only makes it worst

some people say that crying is a sign of weakness, i think that that is true on some level.  but mostly i think that crying for the wrong reaysons is a sign of weakness.

a great man (or as he would prefer boy) once said the ""to live would be a great adventure"" but i think that no one person can realy understand what death is all about untill they die but then once dead they cant really tell the rest of us still here what it is like, well at least not easily.  By the way if you havent yet figured out who sait that it was the boy who lives at ""the 2nd star to the right and stright on till morning.""  (p.s. it was peter pan) goodness learn to watch disney movies. They can solve any problem that you might have. (try it)"

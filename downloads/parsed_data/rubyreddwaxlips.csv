I have to interview people to take my job.  Its weird.  I don't know what to say or what to ask.  And to make matter worse...I'm hungover.  I got no warning either.  I found out this morning that I'd be interviewing people this afternoon.  (in my barely brushed hair, no makeup, jeans, t-shirt, and smelly flipflops)
*******************************
As a side note to all the fun people I hungout with last night: 
I probably embarrassed myself.  
Sorry for making you all watch Debbie Does Dallas.  
The fireworks were beautiful....even though I have a burn on my right thumb...which really hinders my spacebarring.
Thanks for the food and fireworks daybises. (I can't wait to see the fireworks pics)
*******************************
Suki got to come home from the hospital yesterday.  The vet thought that her problems were all related to her hairballs and gave her a prescription for Laxatone.  But when I left work this morning, Suki had not eaten....which means she's went 24 hours without food.  And she's only used the litter box once.  Suggestions will be appreciated...

So thus ends my totally bullshit post."

1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suki's sick.....She's got hairballs coming out of both ends....and she can barely walk right now...I don't know how to fix her.
2. &nbsp; I was unalbe to consolidate my student loans by the June 30 deadline because Mohela's fax number was busy ALL DAY.&nbsp; I should really stop procrasinating...but I'll start tomorrow.
3. &nbsp; I got my new Spin in the mail.&nbsp; Beyonce was on the cover (blah).&nbsp; And most importantly....CHUCK KLOSTERMAN HAS WRITTEN NOTHING FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS!!!&nbsp; Chuck was the only thing good about Spin....I should cancel my subscription.
4. &nbsp; I left my laptop and cell charger at home in Ripley....which resulting in me completing a four hour drive today.
5. &nbsp; I'm almost out of wine and its Sunday.
6. &nbsp; I'm no longer allowed to spend all day at work online.&nbsp; Instead, I'll be staring at four brick walls and listening to the conservatives talk about black people.&nbsp; Goodbye endless hours of internet goodness.
7. &nbsp; I got a nail in my tire....and thus replaced all four....$250!
8. &nbsp; My blood pressure is still not where my doctor thinks it should be....therefore....I'll be talking even MORE expensive drugs.
9. &nbsp; My brother broke up with the only girl he's dated in 10 years that I actually LIKED.&nbsp; It made me cry.
10. Okay....maybe I only had 9 bad things happened.&nbsp; So here's my filler:&nbsp; George Bush is still president."

Nor can he look too far in the future. Mario...at any point within the game....is in the NOW....he's exactly where he should be (unless he's falling down a hole and you hear the inevitable....dodododoodooo)<br /><br />Mario's purpose is to save the princess. He defeats the enemy and finds out that his journey has just began. There are more Koopas to defeat. But he doesn't quit....he's a persistent little plumber.<br /><br />So how does Mario draw his strength? In a world consisting of mostly brick and mortar.....Mario draws his strength from nature....the mushroom, the flower, the star....to make him stronger....to keep him ALIVE.<br /><br />And you can take short cuts....but if you take the long road....you get more experience...more coins....more life....<br /><br />Anyway....I was just vaguely attempted to make sense of it all....<br />Surivatem and I are gonna write a whole book on Geeks and Philosophy.</div>"

"event","Well I'm losing my flight-nity tomorrow.  With any luck, my dreams of meeting Tom Robbins on a plane will come true.  Or maybe, they'll be snakes....and Samuel L. Jackson...who knows.

So what am I gonna miss during my week in Tampa? (In no particular order)

1.  WBFF - All Ben Folds; All the Time! The Saint takes a backseat when I have highspeed access and winamp.

2.  Infinite email threads with rebelbrad - Did you know gmail will only allow 150 replies in a thread before it creates an new email.

3.  Tuesday lunch with Shaporky - Subway might go out of business.  We must reclaim our portion of the Bulldog Den before the ""Avoiding Men"" infest the place with their shifty-eyed-we-only-see-their-backs germs.

Okay, there's probably more...but I'll not list them...because I'm sure the sand, sun, and ocean will lull any negative emotions.
I'll post pictures when I get back to Mississippi. 

BTW, The Polyphonic Spree will release their new album, Fragile Army, on July 3.  Maybe the summer release of their album will spark a summer tour that brings them very close to me.  Yah!!!"

Welcome to 1984!<br />You can read the ordinance <a href=""http://www.cityofstarkville.org/government/documents/Smoking%20Ordinance%202006.pdf"">here</a>.<br />So here's my issues with this ordinance.&nbsp; <br /><br />First of all, I've never understood why the government has to step in to decide whether or not someone harms themselves.&nbsp; <br />If I want to die a slow painful death from lung cancer...then dammit, its my right.<br />If I wanna die in a car accident because I wasn't wearing my seatbelt...then dammit, its my right.<br />If I wanna suffer brain damage because I didn't wear my motorcycle helmet....then dammit, its my right.<br /><br />Second hand smoke, I can understand.&nbsp; But haven't we already made proper allowances.&nbsp; We already have designated areas for those who like to puff the tobacco.&nbsp; If a business/restaurant wants, then THEY can make their institution non-smoking.&nbsp; But of course, most restaurants will not do that because:<br />Drinkers tend to pay for very expensive alcohol. (You know 5 dollar shots 4 dollar beers.)<br />Drinkers tend to tip more.<br />And Drinkers like to smoke!!&nbsp; (Even non-smokers will smoke while drinking.)<br /><br />As a side note, I've never sat in the non-smoking area of a restaurant and smelled smoke.<br /><br />Section 4 of the ordinance (page 4) says:<br />It shall be unlawful for any person to smoke in certain outdoor areas:<br />Immediately preceding or blocking the entrance and/or exit of an area where smoking is prohibited.<br /><br />So who determines where ""immediately"" is?&nbsp; Will the public institutions be required to block off an area around their entrances and exits so that smokers can be aware of their ""safe zones""?&nbsp; What if Mr. Police Mann is having a bad day...he sees you smoking several yards from the front door of Applebee's and bam--$50 fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will control those who control those who control........<br /><br />I just really never thought that this would pass in Mississippi, especially a college town.&nbsp; And most of the ordinance is not that big of deal.&nbsp; I never saw anyone smoking in ""retail stores"" or ""daycares"" anyway.&nbsp; But it really bugs me that the government can boss around the businesses.&nbsp; Why not offer tax breaks to businesses that institute a no smoking policy?....allow the business owner to make their own decisions.&nbsp; It is...after all...their business. <br /><br /><br />"

"event","The last couple of days the weather has been terrible. It started Tuesday night you could here the sleet coming down. It had rained alot as well the whole day. So all this was frozen by morning. We had no cable when I woke up so I had to miss Passions :( All we did was watch CSI all day. Now I am caught up on all the seasons. I was supposed to have the day off and I wasnt worried about having to clean my car. Catherine called me in at 315pm wanting to be there at 345pm. There was no way I was going to get there on time. I think I showed up at 430pm. I spent 10 minutes getting my passenger door open. It was the only one that would unlock. Then after I got the door open I couldnt get it to shut grrr. I called my dad he said to let the car warm and it should shut. It eventually closed :) I got the front window defrosted and the passenger one, but I couldnt get the rest. I made my dad come pick me up and take me to work. I got work and it wasnt even busy. I stayed till 7pm called my dad and made him get back out to pick me up :) There still was no cable when I got home so we just watched movies.
Getting Sick
GRRRRR Im getting sick blech. I hate being sick and I usually never do get sick. My nosy all stuffy and my throat hurts. I hate it all. Its my stepdads fault hes the one spreading all the germs. I have this headache and all I can hear is the stupid raido and its playing some bluegrass crap. Then hes in there trying to play along with the flipping ukelele. I could scream. For lack of anything else going Im out."

"event","On Sunday I tripped and fell at the car wash :( my entire right foot is all messed up. I could barely walk on it. I was supposed to work 11am - 8pm. Well they found a checker to work my first half the 11-3pm. Well I called to tell them that I didnt that I could make the shift at all. My foot was just killing me and its still swollen. Its not just my outside ankle that is swollen. The inside is and the middle part of my foot is as well. Well they said that I would have to go in and work the 6-7pm so that Catherine could get her lunch break. So I called to tell my dad that and he said that I should call Human Resources. I never call in at all. I know that I have for funerals which you would have never got me to go into work. Other then that I go to work sick all the time. Its just a bunch of crap the one time I need to call in I cant. Everyone else can call but me. Now how fair is that? Damn that store! GRRRRRRR! So I went to work that one hour and it was the longest hour of my life. I wore a brace and it made it bearable. I had a shoe on as well and that just killed me so I ended up taking if off. I didnt care....I hated telling everyone the story over and over. Its like I needed a flyer just to give to people when they asked. Matthew
I have been trying to call that boy all night and he phone has been busy. He has stupid dial up, but he wasnt logged on yahoo....usually hes just downloading music and its easier for him if he doesnt run anything else. Its hard to belive that we have been talking for almost a month :)"

"event","Matthew, that boy is really crazy. Wednesday night I talked to him on the phone and he said that he wanted to send me flowers at work and I told him not to waste his money. Hes like I got everything that I need and I want do something special for someone else. So I beg and pleaded him with him not to, but he wasnt listening to me. So I worked Thursday at 645am - 11am well he calls about 9am and says I should be getting something shortly Im like you didnt. I didnt belive him tell he told me who was working in the Floral Department so Im freaking out. So I talk to him while I am on break about 20 minutes and I go back up there and Im talking to Marla. Well she leaves to use the restroom when I get my flowers. They are so gorgeous I really love them I even took pictures of them. So I was happy for the rest of the day  I get on the computer and I was talking to him and hes like did you recive the flowers and Im like yes they are gorgeous and to bad that they ended up in the trash  (yes i know that i am evil) well he had to get ready for work before I could really tell him that I didnt. So he gets on later that evening and says tell me about the truth about the flowers. Hes said that it bugged him all day thinking that they were in the trash so I said that they were in my room (which they really are). He felt alot better about that. I ended up calling him and we talked for a few hours before going to bed. I asked him how much the flowers were and he wouldnt tell me. So I said either way I am finding out because he used his credit card to pay for them and we keep reciepts for everything like that in customer service (which dept. i work in) and Id be able to find out. He still wouldnt tell me by the end of the night. Then he asked me what I wanted and I said something like not wanting to work except when I wanted to once or twice a week and not have to worry about money. He said that he wasnt rich but I wouldnt have to work  hes just a doll. Maybe I dont realize how good of a thing that I have with him. 

I'm not supposed to love you, I'm not supposed to care, I'm not supposed to live my life wishin you were there, I'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you do, but I'm sorry I cant help myself, I fell in love with you."

"event","I just wish I knew who I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with. I know that God knows who it is, but couldnt he point me in the right direction? I'm in a situation that Im not sure what I want to do. If you have been reading my diary for a while now here and tod you would know that I like a guy named Forrest and I have now for ages and I still dont have to courage to say anything. Well lately I have been talking to Matthew hes 34 (11 years older then me) single and lives in Flordia. We have talked on the phone the last two nights its been really nice. Weve talked about everything that you can think of. The first night we talked we were on the phone for almost 10 hours. Last night he said that he wants to meet soon and I dont think that I am ready for that just yet. Theres still alot about me that he doenst know and vice versa. But how can I be honest with him when I have feelings for Forrest and Kirk. It just makes things more difficult. I see Forrest at least once a week because of the store, church, and I talk to him on Msn as well. Hes just wow he just does something wear I get weak in the knees. Then theres Kirk who is in Illinois and I miss him terrible I wish that he would get back from his trip I still have at least another week if not sooner before he gets back. I get the butterflies just talking to him. Another amazing guy. Finally Matthew really doesnt have any of those effects on me. So I feel like that I am just leading him on, but right now I think that I want friendship. I think that he looking for more and I wouldnt be fair to him with me feeling for these guys the way that I do. I just wish that love wasnt so complicated.

It's been pretty boring. I woke up around 130pm and decided to get up for the day. So I went upstairs watched Passions while cleaning. After I was done with that I decided to do my two loads of laundry. I came back home and now Im here. Not much for an exciting day.
Kirk
He has been an awesome friend latley. Now he's going to be gone for ten days I belive. He told me twelve at one time now its ten so I dont know for sure when is going to back. I miss him already hes my late night talker. I stay up 4am at least talking to home. Its always entertaining.
Last Night
It was a good time. Me and Erica went to Wichita to get her books for school. Then we went to Sports World where we were meeting my mom stepdad, Brittney, Cierra, and Erika there at 730pm. They had dinner at Kobes and we had been there a week ago its just to much of a good thing you know? so we didnt go. We were there an hour early so we played all the games that they had there. We earned 930 tickets yay! lol good times Im telling you. We got these inflatable bats and were hitting Brittney and Cierra with them :) lol. I suck at miniature golf I got 5th out of 7 at least I wasnt last. But I was the only one with a hole in one so i rock. So that was my exciting evening."

<P>Life's not been to exciting. Work has been really crazy we have just been super swamped The ad this week isn't even that great. I'd understand if we were having some great sale, but were not and theres not even a holiday coming up. The manager has been a real jerk lately I guess on Tuesday (I had the day off) Anita aka asst. manager ended up leaving the store crying. She was supposed to work all day and she was only there for a few hour's. I hope that she doesn't leave the store she has made thing's alot more bearable (sp?) since she's been there. I don't know how we ever made it without there being an assistant manager for so long. He run's off all the good help just, because we talk to the asst. manager's as friend's instead of the enemy like he is. I think that alot of it is jealousy. </P>
<P>I went to see Harry Potter for a third time in less then two week's. I took Brittney to see it today and I sit there thinking more and more the part's they left out and it just make's me mad lol. That just goes to show that I should have only seen it once and left it at that. I rather read the book's then see the movie's anyday. The movie's aren't doing justice for the book's lol. I definately ready for book six she need's get movin' on it. I don't have forever to wait on it.</P>

<LI>Friday June 4- I woke up around 930am Amy was calling for my morning wake up call. I woke up and got a round. Amy picked me up and we went running around for a bit. About 1130am&nbsp; we went to pick up Chrisitna and we left to head Wichita to go to the movies. We went to see Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban. I was kind of disappointed. Don't get me wrong I really did like it and I enjoyed the movie, but I felt that there were importants parts that they left out from the book. I guess if I hadn't read the book's I might feel differently about the whole thing. After the movie we came back to Wellington and I had to go pick up Erica and head right back up to Wichita again. We were going to the movie's with Jennifer and Jarad and we went to see Harry Potter POA so yeah, I was special and got to see it twice in one day. The second time I analyzed the whole thing lol I paid more attention the second time around since I had already seen it once. After the movie we came home and I started reading and I was out for the count and it was all before midnight. </LI>
<LI>Saturday June 5- Nothing to exciting happened. I went to Wichita with my mom stepdad and sister (brittney). We went to this video store that sells new and used movies and I ended up buying Drumline and Old School. Then we headed for the mall where I bought Legolas buttons from Hot Topic, Britt some lipgloss, and a new purse from JcPennys. I really didnt have a whole lot of money but its all good. </LI>
<LI>Sunday June 6- Today was a really really lazy day. I woke up and was getting ready for church and my mom was talking to me. She and Lanny (stepdad) went to breakfast at the Kinghts of Columbus (they have the best breakfast the church does it all you pay $5 and its all you can eat) well they seen Forrest (he was volunteering and I've had a crush on him for a while now) and my mom was telling Lanny that was my man and she was going to hook us up together. Lannys all like yeah that would be good and he liked him.&nbsp;Then we were&nbsp;at church he was there and some of his family was two rows back where we were from and we were leaving and&nbsp;I was talking to Jarod one of his brothers about work I could hear my mom and Brittney talking. They were saying how Forrest was my man and everything. I swear my family has alreday walking down the aisle and I cant even ask him out. Heres part of a conversation that I had with Mandi tonight. </LI>

<LI>I have so much to tell its crazy. So I hope that you have a few minutes to spare :) </LI>
<LI>Monday- I got a call at 730am and it was from my dad he left me a message to call him back and that he loved me and I needed to hurry. When I heard that I instantly knew my heart just sank. I called him back and he said that my grandpa had just passed away around 7am. He wanted to know if I wanted to go over there and see him before they came and picked him up. I told him that I would then I decided against it. I couldnt bring myself to do it. I know that I would have been surrounded by family, but I couldnt face them. So around 4pm I went over to my dad house to go see him b/c my mom came home and wanted to know why I wasnt with my dad. So I went over there I knew when I did that he would start crying and thats what exactly he did. So I talked to him for a bit and said that everyone is going over to my Aunt Tildas (my grandpa lived with her)&nbsp;for dinner. So we all went over there and everyone was there it was great to see everyone. It was really loud so me Erica and Jennifer (sisters) went into my grandpa bedroom and watched tv. Well here a few minutes my dad came in and we started talking about my grandpa. Me and Erica were telling him about one time we were over there and grandma had made us dinner. So she gave all of us beans and tortillas well Joe (brother) he was tearing his tortilla and dropping them in the beans and he was making a nosie everytime he dropped one in and I can hear my granpda yelling him that he needed to stop playing with his food and just eat it. It still makes me laugh. </LI>
<LI>Tuesday- Me and Erica went to Wal-Mart to buy the Return of&nbsp; The King :) after we were done at Wal-Mart we went to the funeral home because everyone was going to be there. You know he looked like he always did with his overalls on and pens in his pocket. He looked like he was taking a nap and that he would be waking up any minute. I was doing really good until my Aunt Tilda went up there she started bawling and saying how she wanted to take care of him longer and everything. You couldnt help but cry. After the funeral home visit me and Erica went with Jennifer up to her buisness that she helps runs with her husband. They were behind on work because of this happening and then the other girl that works there shes oput of town. So me and Erica went to help her. It wasnt to bad we finished and order for her that was due at the end of the week and took us about two hours after we got ourselves into a routine. We came back home and went over to my Aunt Tildas for dinner. Someone brought over a pot roast and everything was just delicious. </LI>
<LI>Wednesday- I went to Wichita to get my nails done I had broken one and they needed to be filled. It helped me take my mind off things with everything going on. When I got back to Wellington I wanted to see my dad and he wasnt home so I headed for the funeral home. It was just him Becky and Tilda a lil bit later my Uncle Bubba showed up with his wife Pam. We just sat there and talked about everything. We said our goodbye before we left the funeral home. The rosary went really well. My dad went up there and spoke and us kids started crying. He was saying how in the last couple of days he has really gotten to know his three youngest kids (me joe and erica) and how we were telling him things that he didnt know about his dad. We were over there everyday before and after school. He shared the story that we told him about Joe dropping pieces of the tortillas in the the beans. Everyone was just laughing so that was good. After the rosary we went to Tildas and had another dinner. We just had left overs there was so much food there and she lives by herself in that house so she really doesnt need a whole lot.</LI>
<LI>Thursday- I went over to the funeral home with the family around 9am so we could view the body and say our last goodbyes one last time. A few people got up and told some stories they were good ones they made us laugh and cry. All the paul bearers rode in my grandpas old car it was so funny the six of them squeezed into that car. We were saying how they should have been playing low rider lol. We got to the church and had the funeral and when leaving the church they draped the casket with the American flag (he had served in world war two) and we left the church. We headed over to the cemetary and there was the color gaurd full dressed in uniform they looked really good. Father finished the rest of the church part of the grave site service and let the Military do theirs. They shot off the guns three times and then one of them played taps and two of them came up and got the flag off the casket and got in line to fold it. Its just really different I had never seen anything like that. It was just amazing and Im sure that my grandpa would have been proud. After the cemetary we went over to the Parrish Hall and had the dinner that the church provides. We left there and we all went home for the afternoon. Around 5pm we went over to Tildas and had a bbq. I have this cousin that is 5 and his name is Tyler hes so cute and funny. We were outside and he was crying b/c his mom had left to go home and he was staying the night at grandmas (tilda) well he wanted to go on the front porch but he needed someone to go with him so me and Erica went with him he was cracking us up. He seen the first star of the night we told him he needed to make a wish and not tell anyone. Hed go over to the side of the car and make his wish outloud. We couldnt really hear what it was saying but it was cute. I think he make a 100 wishes on that on star lol. Well he found a star for me to make a wish on and he said that he would move over so I could say mine outloud as well lol. Then I told him we had to go inside so I could use the restroom and when I was done we would go back out. Well Bailey came and got a pop and Tyler is well like mom isnt here so Im going to have another one lol. Hes limited on him pop intake it was just too cute the way he said it. We went outside to catch lightening bugs well him and Bailey finally caught one he was so excited he had him arms up in the air jumping up and down it was great :) he just made me laugh so much and I think that I really needed it. </LI>

<P>In Time Of Loss
Lonely is the home without you,
Life to us is not the same;
All the world would be like heaven,
If we could have you back again. 

A light is from our household is gone
A voice we loved is still,
A place is vacant in our home,
That never can be filled.

May the God of Love and Mercy,
Care out loved one who is gone,
And bless with the consolation,
those left to carry on.

The happy house we once enjoyed,
;How sweet their memory still,
But death has left a vacant place,
This world can never fill. 

How dearly we loved you,
And prayed you might live,
But Jesus just beckoned,
And we had to give. 

God gave us strength to bear it,
And courage to fight the blow,
What has it meant to lose you,
God alone will ever know."

<LI>Friday was my great grandmothers rosary. There was alot of people there so many people shared memories about her. I think thats what gets you the most you can be doing really good and then people start talking about her and it hits you all at once. Tonight <B>reality</B> really sank in. Ill never get a hug or a kiss from her. I wont see her in the grocery store with my Aunt Helen anymore. No more mexican food which was just awesome and everyone loved it. There are just so many things that everyone is going to miss. She never judged you, if you made a mistake she would tell you and her love for you never went astray. She didnt hold the mistakes against you. She loved us all the same. Shes going to be missed greatly by everyone. </LI>
<LI>Saturday was the funeral. We started off by going to meet the family at the funeral home so we could follow the hurst to the church. While in the funeral home everyone was saying their last goodbyes before they closed the casket. One of my cousins went up to the front and read something that one of her daughters had written about her. It was beautiful everyone really started crying. We went to church and&nbsp;after we left there we went to the cememtary. Everything just seems so final when you go out there. I always get this sick feeling to my stomah :| I dont even like thinking about it. My dad was there and he came by and gave me a hug and I asked how Grandpa Vincent (my dads..dad)&nbsp;was doing and it doesnt look to good. When we finished there my mom took me and Erica to a different part of the cemetary to show us where Grandpa Alberts (moms dad)&nbsp;parents were buried, he had a brother there, and his girl Estella (she died on christmas day from pnemonia and was only six months old). I think when I get more money Ill go put flowers on the graves there are none there and there is no reason that I cant. When we left the cemetary we went the the Parish Hall when some of the women from the church makes a dinner for the family. There was rice, pork chilli, fideo, beans, tortillas, green beans, ham, bread, and more. We were there for a few hours. We went home and changed and went over to my grandma Barbaras house. She was making us laugh she is a funny women. She was taking out pictures of the kids when they were younger it was cute. My Aunt Sandra was there and she was telling us that our Grandpa Albert isnt doing to well. He cant move his legs at all anymore he barely has any movement in his arms. Slowly his organs will start to shut down and hes gained a ton of weight because of his diabetes and water gain. </LI>
<LI>I just want to know when will all this pain and suffering go away. My uncle is in Iraq and do you know how terrible it will be for him to come and grandma and his father have passed away. If Albert does pass away I belive that they will let him come home for the funeral. Things just arent looking good. </LI>

I went to work at 10am and I was there till 1pm. I met Erica over at my dads house and we went to see my grandpa that isnt doing so well. Well I got back to work at 3pm and everything was going pretty good. I get a phone call its almost 4pm and its my cousin Sarah she calls to tell me that our grandma is gone. I didnt want to belive one word that she was saying the family was hoping that she would have made it till she got to see her boys or at least hear them one last time. They were on their way here from that airport they didnt get here till after 7pm. I happened to be checking on the register at the time when I got the phone call so I told the girl in customer service that I had to go that my grandmother has just passed away and of course I was crying and there was customers there as well :\ but I know that I couldnt have&nbsp;worked.I could hear the girl talking to the manager and he didnt want me to go. He wanted me to stay there Im telling you that this man has&nbsp;no feelings at all. How could you make someone work when something so emotional is going on? I just have to keep reminding myself that she is in a better place now and with my grandpa and her parents. Im sure they were just all waiting to give her one heck of a greeting. Shes lived such a long and fulfiling life shes has a ton of great grand kids over 50 at least and then she even has great great grandkids. The funeral is going to be Saturday morning and the Rosary is going to be Friday night. <!-- ZoneLabs Popup Blocking Insertion -->

<LI>Tod- That stupid site is down again. How am I supposed to fix my diary description? I made this really cute layout. I like it alot Im proud of myself lol. You all need to check it out my diary name at the moment .diane kruger. but that will change as soon as tod os up and running again, but Im not sure when that will because they are finally upgrading.&nbsp; </LI>
<LI>Work- This I was only scheduled 28.25 hours well I have been picking some up throughout the week. Im planning to go to Chicago this summer and I really need the money. So far I have picked up eight hours so that means Im up to 36. I was going to see if Amy will let me stay for her on Saturday night till 11pm. Im working 12-9 I know that will be a long day but like I said Im not being picky about the hours. Well just have to see how Saturday goes before I even offer sometimes me and Amy dont get along. I just get frustrated with her just not a good multitasker. She knows everyone so shes always talking or taking off and you not know where she is going. So you end up doing the majority of the work grrrr. One of these day I might have the courage and say something to her. Shes just scatter brain and unorganized that just drives me insane. Since Im one of those people that have to be organized all the time. Anywho the other day a girl called in and Catherine asked if I wanted the hours and I said sure. Id have to come back I was working 12-4 and the hours were 7-1030pm. Shes well let tell Dennis (store manager) and see what he says. You know the jerk wouldnt even let me work the hours. Just because I make 9.50per hour and he get on the little teenagers to do it for less. </LI>
<LI>Ramblings- Mothers Day I didnt realize how fast that it was approaching. Last week I only worked 32 hours so my pay check isnt going to be very big at all. Rents due as well which is $150, I need gas for my car, and Lannys Birthday is this next Wednesday. I might have to break down and take money out of the bank I only have 270 or 260 in there and that was supposed to go towards Chicago I need to have 300-400 before June 18th. Whats going to happen is if I take out money Im going to have put in a ton more in. I get paid every Friday so first thing is Im going to take money out for the bills and gas and the rest is going to go in there. Through work they take $25 out every pay check so I just wont touch that and I should have at least $200 in there. I need to have 400-500 to go. I just wont buy groceries and if I want to eat Ill go the either of the parental units house lol. Thats means no more shopping trips. The only thing Im allowing myself to spend money on is to go see Troy, Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban, and to buy Return of the King. Sounds good right?</LI>

<LI>Okay for starters I really didnt need a new journal. I just didnt like the name I had and I couldnt see anywhere you could change your name. </LI>
<LI>Work- Its been kind of crazy lately. This week I only had twenty eight schedules hours. Well Im going on a trip this summer so I need the money. So far I have picked up eight hours which brings me to thirty six. Well&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl called in today her seven to ten thirty shift and Catherine asked me if I wanted the hours because she knew that I wanted them. I told her that I would and she said that she had to get it approved by Dennis (manager) first. Well I told her to let me know what was going on. Well he wants to ask someone else before he lets me have them. What a tight ass just because I make nine dollars and fifty cents an hour. I guess he thinks I dont need the money because after all Im working there. What a jerk! </LI>
<LI>Christina- she is a girl I work with. We have gotten so close lately we are now walking buddies. We go every chance that we get to go walking our two miles around the track and we talk. Its hard to belive that I didnt like her when she first started out at the store. But its great that we are getting along so well. That means I have someone else to talk with at the store that I can stand :) </LI>
<LI>Sam- My brother is having to go through a huge custody battle with his kids. Which I think that its a bunch of crap he has had them the past seven years and nothing has went wrong. Sure the times were tough but he made them throught. He has had our family helping him all the way. He makes one mistake by pushing their mother and no its some huge ordeal. The only reason he pushed her was that she was hitting the baby (well shes 5) thats close enough. Now the kids are with her and he doesnt know when he is going to get to see them again. The mother is in total control of the whole situation. Grrr! It just irritates me and get this he still has his other daughter living with him. Why are they going to take the other kids and not her (she has a different mother but if he was that bad of a dad shouldnt they make her go with her mother). If he sees the kids she has to appprove and they have to be supervised visits. Shes telling them that&nbsp;he is a emotional and physical abuser. The only thing that he has done to those kids is yell at them and thats normal parenting and thats only if they do someting wrong. He has court again on May 24th by then he wont have seen the kids for over a month. This is just tearing him up he is so lost without his son. Im sure that he misses all the kids but the boy is only one out of four kids so hes his right hand man. </LI>
<LI>May- wow this is a good month Return of the King and Troy come out yay! </LI>
<LI>Goodbye</LI></UL>"

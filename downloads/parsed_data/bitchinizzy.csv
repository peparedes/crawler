"event","I figure now's as good a time as any for an update.  Whenever I make an effort to write something, the first thing that enters my mind is, ""which should I write about first...?  Real life or ffxi?""  The sad thing is, in general ffxi gives me more to think about than my life does.  Well.. most of the time.

Last weekend turned out slightly differently than expected.  Thursday night my brother convinced me that it would be a good idea to go with him and his friends (most of which are also my friends) to Boston.  ""Why Boston?"" you ask.  I'd tell you if I knew.  It was a destination.  ""And what would you do at this destination?""  To Drink.  For three days and two nights we drank.  Bar to bar to bar until we finally stumbled back to our hotel completely exhausted.  I have to say that although I wasn't entirely enthusiastic about the whole occasion, I had a lot of fun.  Silas is lucky he didn't mention that the weekend would cost me $300 before we left.  That kind of bill almost sucks the fun out of the weekend.

The thing is, I'm trying to save up a decent amount of money for my road trip this August.  I'm thinking the trip will end up costing me a minimum of $1500-2000.  So I want to have at least $3000 in the bank before we go.  I've drifted between $500 and $1500 for a while.  But as always, something comes up and I end up depleting my surplus.  I've got three months left until we leave at this point.  If I can manage to save about $700 a month I'll be set.  Yikes.. that's almost a whole paycheck.  I doubt I can pull that off... maybe if I do nothing but work and play ffxi. ^^

My trip home has been delayed from last weekend to this weekend.  I'll either drive down on Friday night or mid-Saturday.  This is basically a take-three shot at watching some anime with Mike.  Oh, and I'm going to have to spend some time at my Dad's place, and probably take my sister out somewhere because I can't take her to Great Adventure for her birthday.

Ok, ok... ffxi time.

PD has been having some relative success in Dynamis.  We're getting very good at clearing everything but the Boss repops in the cities.  In Xarcabard we're very close to reaching the last time extension which means that much more chance of getting AF there.

Limbus has been the same as always, we're getting close to another Ultima.  We had a few pathetic losses due to lack of attendance and poor leadership.  I hate to say it, but I've gotten what I want from Limbus so I'm not too concerned.

We did a few Kirins recently for pretty pathetic drops.  We ended the night with Gremlin kicked out of PD due to bad leadership.  Short version of the story is:  Gremlin joined PD after being promised an Osode by his friend and PD leader Mrz.  About six months later, PD finally kills a few Kirins and the Osode drops.  Gremlin has said nothing about it til now.  He asks if this one will be his as promised and he's told, ""there's a few people who are going to get if before you.""  Seeing as he was already unhappy with other leadership decisions, this was the last straw and he said he was going to leave the ls, but wanted the chance to say goodbye.  Mrz promptly kicks Gremlin from the ls.  ... Way to be an asshole.  Princesspupu and Malakai, both very good members and friends of Gremlin, leave with him.

My Assault static was progressing quickly, but after Gremlin was kicked we just stopped.  Since then any ffxi time not spent at PD events has been spent leveling War.  I'm trying to catch up to a few friends at level 55, so that we can static all the way to 75.  Leveling War has been fun, but I just haven't had much time to play outside of PD events.  I hit level 45 last night and I'll try to hit 50 or so by Friday.  I won't be playing at all this weekend which sucks because I feel obligated to catch up seeing as there's people waiting for me to reach 55.

This static might turn out to be a really good thing.  We plan on exping, doing ENMs and Assault.  Right now it looks like me, Kyahadu, Danadane, Vegita and Syren.  I'm sure I'm forgetting someone.  Everyone is good at their job and is on Vent for easy communication.

Uhg.. this entire entry has felt so forced.  Words on a page, that's it.  Bah, I don't care.  Time to take my lunch."

"event","PD seems to be stuck in a groove.  We get good members, teach them the basics of endgame, then they leave taking all the equipment we invested in them with them.  Then we invite new members and start all over again.  And then there's the dedicated members that stick around through thick and thin like me.  I've been done with Sky for over a year, done with the City Dynamis's for almost as long... yet I'm still doing them every week.  The amount we've grown over the past year is dismal.  Granted we still exist, but why are we still small fries?

The biggest problem is that our leadership isn't active enough to keep us organized properly.  We keep doing the same thing over and over.  And we never really get better at it.  We keep losing our good members and replacing them with newbies.  Due to this routine, sometimes we actually perform worse than we used to.

What's keeping me in PD?  Well, we are doing Dynamis in the Glacier and Xarcabard from which I need my Thf AFv2.  Because of my attendance, I'm first in line when they drop.  It'll be a while til I get anything from Limbus again, seeing as I've been given the Homam body and feet.  However, I feel obligated to stay after recieving such enviable items.  Other than that, what does PD have left to give me?  Neptunal: Legs and Pixie Earring would be nice, but we don't camp HNMs.

I don't even know why I'm complaining.  PD had done a lot for me and I've generally been happy.  It's just that sometimes I wish that I was in a ls that could do everything and did it well.  I'm talking Jorm, Tiamat, KB, Nidhogg, Aspi, etc.  I'm sure ls's like that have their downsides that I'd find a way to complain about (probably more than I think), but I'd still like a chance to do the things I haven't done in endgame.  Then sometimes I wish I didn't have a hnmls at all.  Just level up new jobs, and have fun doing Assault and BCNMs from time to time."

"event","Well, I imagined this happening for a long time, and to my amazment it did.  However, my enjoyment was a little bittersweet.  A little backstory...

As I've mentioned before, Mrz took my pearlsack away.  When he did this, he started off the conversation with, ""I've got some good news and some bad news.""  The bad news was that he was taking my pearlsack away for unexplained reasons.  The good news was; ""The Homam Corazza is 100% yours when/if it drops.""  For me, that was a big ""IF"" and I was feeling very crappy about losing my pearlsack so I didn't really think the ""good"" part was all that great.

Even before the whole pearlsack thing, PD got Xolotl to drop the THIRD Perseus Harpe on the server, which went to a fellow PD Thf, Kyahadu.  When he outlotted me, of course I was incredibly jealous, but as far as he was concerned I was a gracious loser.  I didn't get really quiet and pout about it.  I didn't say something like, ""Well, I'm quitting soon anyway.""  I said, ""Congratulations man, I'm really happy for you.""  I literally cheered about it just as much as he did.

A few months later and we're finally doing a 2nd Proto-Omega.  The fight goes by very smoothly with most of the deaths only in the melee party.  The chest pops with over 15 min left and I wait in suspense as Mrz waits a second to open it.  And to my utter amazement, I see; ""You find a Omega's Heart in the Treasure Chest.""  I was literally speechless.  I always figured my reaction would involve more jumping for joy.  But I just sat there rereading that line to make sure I wasn't dreaming.  I finally forced out a, ""Oh... my... God...""

I was waiting for Kya to say something, he was talkative enough before/during the fight.  He knew it was going to be mine if it dropped, so I was expecting him to be a little more vocal about it (like I was when he got his Perseus Harpe).  Nothing.  Silence.  *pout*

So I'm trying to be really happy and excited about something I get that is very much deserved, and he says nothing until a very belated, unfeeling, ""congrats.""  I mean, how could he rationalize getting Perseus's Harpe AND Homam Corazza anyway?  How would that be fair?

Anyway, to my elation, Mrz finally told me to lot my Omega's Heart.  We immediately ran to Mhuara to turn it in and moments later I was sporting my new Homam Corazza.  This is the coolest looking armor in the game... looks so bad-fucking-ass.  +15acc and ""Enhances Triple Attack"" are both very noticable.  Nothing else in the game comes close.  I did a few Assaults with it, and plan to exp with it tonight.  (I went afk near the AH to show off last night... you just have to show something like this off.)"

"event","I drove home to visit friends and family last weekend.  Well, the weekend before last I mean.  It was the first long trip with my new car which I've been very happy with so far.  I almost hit 400 miles on my last tank of gas.  Yes, that makes me very happy.

I spent some time with the family, which can be overwhelming.  Sometimes I wonder how I lived with my family for eighteen years.  Coming home certainly makes me feel loved though.  I get so much attention between my little brothers wanting me to play video games with them (they're better than me), Naphtali wanting to show me the anime she likes (she watches more than me), Garland asking me to take her to a concert (I gave in) and Dad wanting to talk with me.  I didn't see much of Grace and Gabrielle.  I only saw them on Sunday night as I was leaving to drive home.  Everyone else was asleep, but they were in the old van parked outside smoking.  Cigarettes or Weed?  Both?  Not entirely sure, but they sure did have a lot of junk food.

Somehow, almost everyone I knew from high school happened to be in town the same weekend.  John, Tim, Matt and Bobby were all at Tim's place, so I dropped by for a while.  John managed to surprise me yet again with a mohawk and a full beard.  After hanging out for a bit, they went out to smoke so I took my leave.  I wish I could drive down every weekend, becuase I never have enough time to spend time with everyone I want to.  

My original plan was to watch Naruto and Family Guy all weekend with Mike, but that didn't exactly work out.  More specifically, it didn't happen at all.  Not that I'm complaining though.  We can waste a weekend on anime anytime, but watching old Kung Fu and Horror movies over at Jared's was a much better use of our time.  We also went to the mall where I picked up the last eight Kenshin mangas (what happens after the anime) and a book that Jared highly recommended (I have no doubts it'll be good because Jared has great taste in literature).  We also managed to pick up a board game for $6 which turned out to be pretty good.


This week starts spring break at Rutgers.  You'd think that would mean parties, girls and drunkeness for me, but I'll probably just put in a lot more hours at work...  Fun.

Josh called me Friday night suggesting that I go on a hike with him on Saturday.  This being the first time I heard from him in over a month, on the spur of the moment, I agreed to come.  Then comes Sat morning...  Phone rings and in my morning drunkeness and unhappiness of being woken up before my desired twelve hours of sleep, I simply turned my ringer off.  I woke up at 3pm and realized that Josh had called me more than ten times.  I feel too damn guilty to even call him back now.  I still haven't worked up the courage to check my messages... I hate letting people down.  Yet I do it a lot somehow, go figure.


Things have been moving slowly in ffxi.  I'm still an officer.  By ""still"" I mean that the first month has felt like a hazing period during which there were several times I regretted accepting a pearlsack.  I stopped butting heads with Seek and Nalia after I realized that the role I was being asked to play wasn't quite what I'd hoped.  Now I've reached a neutral point, making sure to defer to Seek and Nalia for any important decisions.  I don't know if my role will change, Mrz says it will but I have my doubts.  I'm quite sure Mrz promoted me without Seek and Nalia's consent and they weren't comfortable with another officer that wasn't content to sit back and watch.  So until Seek and Nalia tell me that there's room for me to move up, I'm convinced I won't be going anywhere.

Dynamis has gone relatively well so far.  We've attempted Beaucedine Glacier twice and made the same mistake on the last boss both times.  I have no doubt we'll succeed next time.  My only complaint is a lack of Thiefs.  Of course there's me, but I'm usually the only one.  We need more Thiefs for more Treasure Hunter for more drops.  I wouldn't mind having more people in general too.  We've gotten a lot of people a lot of equipment, but it can be better.

We finished another round of Sky, which means we won't be going back for a while.  Just after I reach Sky on my second character with Mike.  We've continued progressing in Limbus.  Just two more coins til I can pay back Mrz the 25 I owe him and start collecting my own again.  We're halfway to another Ultima attempt which I'm looking forward to.  Umm, I don't know if I mentioned this since it's been a while since I updated, but we killed Omega and he dropped two organs for Homam Gambieras(feet).  Kya and I both got one, and these boots are oh so sexy...  +3% Haste, +6 Acc, +6 Ranged Acc, +32 hp.

On a side note, I've leveled my fishing skill to 20.  Just ten more levels and I can do the Inside the Belly quest for a Mercurial Kris."

"event","I finally managed to get my ass outside last weekend.  Silas, his friend Ivan, and I drove to Blue Mountain on Sunday.  The slopes here were much longer and more challenging, so I had a lot of fun.  I stayed mainly on the Blue and Green slopes.  I was tempted to try a Black, but by the time I felt up for it I was too tired to trust myself on a difficult slope.  I did cut across to the end of a Double Black several times though.  It was just the end of the slope where there was simply one wide, straight and very steep drop to get to the bottom.  I wouldn't be surprised if I hit speeds of 40+ mph cruising down that hill.  It certainly felt as if one false move would mean broken bones...  Good fun.  Now if I could only get myself out running again.  What has it been?... three weeks?

This weekend I'm going to finally drive home for the weekend.  Hopefully."

Quite possibly the most exciting battle I've ever been part of in FFXI.  We were defeated last time we tried Ultima, and we were back with vengeance on our lips.  Not exactly a ""clean"" fight, but we got the job done, with time to spare.

The first 80% was relatively painless.  A tank was killed here and there, but nothing crippling.  After that he goes crazy and starts using a very annoying ability where he targets one person and counts down from 30.  When he reaches 0, that person explodes, taking out anyone else that happens to be near him.  At 20% hp he uses this ability every minute or so, so you have at least one guaranteed death very often.  A lot of us were fighting weakened at the end.

The resolution on the video is a little low, but you can get the gist of the battle.  At one point in the middle of the video, you see me close a cool looking Light Skillchain with Shark Bite.  It looks so badass the way it sincs up with the music, but if I remember correctly, that Shark Bite landed for something pitiful like 43 damage.

Right at the end, all but four of us are dead, and Ultima is at 1% and is using that damn countdown ability.  Mrz is screaming at the living people to run away, but Coolmints(Smn) runs toward him with Fenrir out.  Ultima's countdown reaches 3 when Fenrir finally lashes out and defeats him.  It was pretty intense at the end...

The drops were the head and hand armor for mages(can't remember the name of it).  The head has +5 magic accuracy and +2% haste, so it's best for Rdm.  We gave it to Nalia.  The hands have -1 to avatar perpetuation, so they're best for Smn.  We gave them to JM.

Omega is next!!!  Homam Corraza perhaps?"

$1490  Wow, much better than I thought.  Of course this doesn't include gas and food money.


Will, Natalie and Kyle came up to New Brunswick to visit last weekend.  By the time I came over, they had already started playing D&D.  I remember the original plan being a weekend of role playing, but in the end, I think we played for twenty minutes (as least when I was there).  Other than that, there was a lot of drinking.  At some point I walked to Silas' place with Josh to pick up my vcr.  The rest of the night we watched our old high school movies and continued to drink.

The night ended a little early, so I helped Kyle find Rt. 18 and walked home.


So much has changed for me in FFXI.  Over the past week I've slowly been integrated in as an officer.  All of a sudden, you look at the linkshell from an entirely different perspective.  I have to pay close attention to every member where I used to be happily oblivious of all the inner workings of the LS.  Here's an example.

Kakurenbu(Pld), Bikkle(Blm), Porusan(Mnk), Kezy(Rdm), Toushi(Thf) and Jommy(Whm) are all in PD.  They've all been in our linkshell since last summer/fall.  But they're all part of their own little group.  The only two member that I (and the other PD officers) care about are Kaku and Poru.  Kaku has been a good main tank for us for a long time.  Poru is just a very likable person who tries hard to do his best.  Well, PD has decked out these members over the past couple months, and up until recently they put PD events ahead of their own smaller events so that they could get the gear they wanted.  But recently, they've decided that they didn't need to come to all of our events anymore and on top of that, Kaku and Bikkle have been extremely mean/rude to our newer members.  Mrz was nice and gave them special permission to do their own stuff during some of our events.  But now they don't even show up for our few important events.  And when they do show up, they're uncooperative and rude.
Now as a linkshell, we've put a lot of items into these members.  But now they seem to be more trouble than they're worth.  We can't kick one without losing all of them.  Replacing them usually means new members that will need all the same gear all over again.

This is the most extreme case, but it's the sort of thing I normally wouldn't even know about until something happened.

I'm still loving being in charge of Dynamis.  I have lots of ideas, and the LS is learning very quickly.  If we can maintain an average of 30-40 people every run, I can see us easily reaching Xarcabard.
We ended up trying for a Windurst win last run, but ended up running low on time and making mistakes.  We'll do a Windy farming run this Wed and make up our Bastok win this weekend."

"event","Car obtained!
I picked up my 2002 Honda Civic LX Coup last weekend.  The feeling I get whenever I get in my car now is almost surreal.  Yeah, it's not like it's a brand new car, or anything really special.  But I've never owned anything decent, and it's a good feeling to get into a nice car and know that it's mine.
A couple annoyances though...  One brake light doesn't work, a minor fix.  The driver's side door's lock seems to be a little stuck.  I can force it down, but I'll want to get that fixed.  I also don't have keyless entry.  All minor details in the grand scheme of things, but still annoying.
Everything else is great.  The exterior/interior are in great condition.  It only has 38k on it, which is very good considering it's 3-4 years old now.  And best of all, I bought the car at over $4,000 under the retail value.  I'm going to have to get into the habit of actually taking care of my car now.

So much to do...
Pick up my new title and registration.  (I have a 30 day grace period, but I'd rather not push it.)
Oil change and fix the brack light.
Get my car inspected.  (Previous sticker was from Deleware.)
Have a picture taken of my car for my insurance.
Drive my parents van back to my Grandma's with Silas' help.  (It's taking up driveway space.)
Laundry.  (way... way overdue)

Big FFXI news!
As planned, I talked to Mrz about leading Dynamis.  It didn't take much convincing at all.  All it took was a suggestion on my part and he immediately agreed.  Seeker and Nalia have been doing everything Dynamis related for a while, but I've taken over almost everything.  There's still a few things I'd like to work out though.
We won Dynamis-Jeuno on Sunday, although it was a little messy at the end.  Drops were crap, only one Bard AFv2 dropped the whole run.  Still, it was a win which was the purpose of the run.  I've planned a Dynamis-Bastok run for Wednesday.

Bigger FFXI news!
After Limbus on Sunday night, Mrz asked me to meet him in the Tavnazian Safehold.  Could he...?  I put on my teleport ring, 30 secs later I'm there.  Could this be it...?  I take a screenshot as he runs up to me.  This is it, I know it...  Z tells me he has something he wants to let me borrow.  doh...  He trades me 25 Ancient Beastcoins which gives me the 75 I need for my Brutal Earring, yay!  ""Oh, there's something else.  Now that you're leading dynamis, how would you like a pearlsack(Officer status).""  WOOOOOOOOT!!!

I may have to put some hours in on the weekends to keep up with my bills.  Now that I have a car, my monthly living expenses double.

Rent: $375

My feet have healed after the beating they recieved last week.  I haven't run since Sunday, so it's almost time for a nice 4-6mile run.  I'd like to get into the habit of running 2-3 times a week.  I bought a new pair of shoes and I've been wearing them in since last weekend.  With any luck they'll be little easier on my feet.


In FFXI news:

I've leveled Ninja to 45, and I'm enjoying it.  Ninja tanking is... interesting.  Paladins are all about getting hit, but taking little damage.  Ninjas are all about evading everything entirely.  You do this by using two Utsusemi(shadow) spells.  These are Utsusemi: Ichi and Utsusemi: Ni.  Uts: Ichi creates three shadows that will absorbe a non-evaded attack directed at you.  It takes about 5 seconds to cast and has a short recast time.  Uts: Ni creates four shadows, and takes about 2 seconds to cast and has a long recast time.  Uts: Ni will overwrite Uts: Ichi, but not visa versa.  So here's how it works.

You start the fight with Uts: Ni, all recast timers are at 0.

You use Provoke and use enfeebling spells(Hojo(slow), Jubaku(paralyze), and Kuriyama(blind)) along with some elemental debuff spells(i.e. Huton: Ni does wind damage and lowers resistance to Ice)

When three of your four shadows are gone, you start casting Uts: Ichi.  This is because Uts: Ichi takes too long to cast to get your shadows back up between attacks.  So you start casting it when you still have one shadow left.  You time it so that the enemy will attack you when you're 30-50% of the way through casting Uts: Ichi.  From this point there are two possibilities:
1.  The enemy takes your fourth shadow and you allow Uts: Ichi to finish casting, giving you three shadows.
2.  The enemy misses you and you're still left with 1 shadow.  Uts: Ichi will not overwrite that last Uts: Ni shadow, so before your Uts: Ichi casting reaches 75%, you have to force-dispel that last shadow manually.  If you time it right, you remove the last Uts: Ni shadow a moment before Uts: Ichi finishes casting, giving you three shadows.

You continue the fight in this nature, possibly contributing in a Skillchain(and Magic Bursting with a elemental spell), until the mob is dead.

It takes a lot of concentration to be a Ninja tank, but when fighting some mobs, there's just nothing you can do.  Yesterday we starting killing Spiders because there weren't enough Beetles to pull.  Spiders have a devastating move called Sickle Slash.  Normally it can be absorbed by a shadow, but sometimes you just get unlucky.  One of the times I died, I had two shadows up and almost full hp.  The spiders double attacked and took both shadows, and before I could recast them, it used Sickle Slash and one-shot me.  Every fight with a spider was a gamble, but I think I did pretty well all things considered.  I'll continue leveling Ninja when I have free time, but it'll probably take a long time.

Phoenix Down is done with Sky Gods for the next few months.  The two main things that we'll be doing in the coming weeks that I'm interested in are Limbus and Dynamis.  We're two chips away from having another set for Ultima and we also got one Omega chip.  I've decided to save my ancient beastcoins for a Brutal Earring instead of upgrading my AF gloves first.  I'm already up to 42 coins, so I'm already very close to the 75 I need.  I might go straight for my Boxer's Mantle after that.

Dynamis is going to take a lot of effort.  It kinda sucks that I have already put so much effort into dynamis, and obtained the three city AFv2.  So I'm back at the learning stage again with everyone in PD and I'll have nothing to gain through it.  It'll be a while until we actually get past the city Dynamis's, but I hope we do get past them to do Beaudacine and Xarabard, which I can benefit from.

I've been thinking about asking Mrz for leadership of our Dynamis runs.  I have the most Dynamis experience in PD, and I'll be in control as the puller.  Jommy and JM are the supposed ""leaders"" of dynamis, but they've put very little effort into organizing everything.  I feel the entire ls could benefit from my leadership in Dynamis, and it'd give me something to look forward to.  Becoming PD's dynamis leader would probably mean recieving Officer status.  Yeah... I think I'll ask Mrz about it today."

"event","Josh called me on Sunday and suggested we go for a run on Monday.  I've been meaning to get back into shape for a while, but I don't have enough initiative to do it on my own.  So I finally ended up running an easy ""4 mile run.""  Somehow, we ended up running 8 miles...  I haven't run for months, and I end up starting with a 8 mile run.  I must say, I'm not as sore as I expected I'd be, but I desperately need new running shoes.  The ones that I have (which are upwards of three years old) are not easy on my feet.  So I ended up with large blisters along the arches of my feet.  Eh, as the saying goes, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""  I'll be running again today, hopefully something lighter.

After recovering from our run, I headed over to Josh's place to drink.  Yeah... drinking on a Monday night.  I didn't plan on drinking a lot, but I ended up drinking a shot of cheap vodka every time Hank Hill mentioned propane.  So I ended up being very drunk by the end of the night.  I left at 1am or so and stumbled home.  I collapsed on my bed and fell asleep immediately fully dressed.  Luckily I had thought ahead and set my alarm for 7:15am before I got home.  I was still a little drunk when I woke up, but that wore off quickly.


Not much has happened the past few days in FFXI for me.  I missed the last two Sky events.  I'm making an effort to level Ninja.  I bought all my gear last week, and as of yesterday I'm level 40.  I'll probably get a few Merits with Thf to put them into Evasion at some point this week."

"event","Mom tried to convince me to move to Arizona with Gloria.  My sister has been having trouble with her new husband, Craig.  I always had my doubts about him, but it turns out he's not the person that he's been portraying himself as.  Gloria didn't want to go back to Arizona alone, and Mom decided I'd be the best person to accompany her to help her through this ordeal.  She has always wanted me to move out of New Jersey to ""start over"" and pursue a teaching career.  She has the image of me as a teacher stuck in her head since I took it upon myself to tutor my younger siblings (and did a good job of it).  However, I know I will continue to pursue a degree in computer technology.  Anyway, Mom thinks she know best, and she thinks I should go with Gloria.  I said no.

I wish I could say I said it reluctantly, but I'm not about to drop everything and leave.  I have a great job for while I'm in school.  All my friends and most of my family are here in NJ.  Being so far away from everything I know would probably just depress me again.  I may humor them with a visit, but I doubt it would ever go further than that.


I hope to own my car by this weekend.  The person selling the car I'm interested in comes back from vacation soon and I'll finally be able to take a look at it.  It's a 2002 Honda Civic.  Yeah, not a particularly fast or powerful car, but it's dependable and gas efficient which is what I need most.  It also only has 38k miles on it and is priced at almost $4,000 under the normal retail price.  I'll be looking at the car and getting it checked by a mechanic before I buy it of course, but I hope everything works out.

I have my parents old van until I get my car though.  It's so nice to be able to drive to work again.  Taking the train definitely sucked (except for the time it gave me to read).


Nothing new really FFXI-wise.  I haven't been on much the past few days.  We won another Limbus a few days ago, which means three more til our second Ultima fight.  Sky is rolling along, and we'll probably kill 10 Kirins before all is said and done."

My new year's celebration this year sucked compared to last year's.  I woke up at 11:45, ran over to Silas' apartment, counted down from ten, ran home and went back to sleep.  Last year I spent New Year's Eve with Sandra, Josh and Lauren.  Granted our trip to Tuckerton ended in semi-disaster, we managed to get back to New Brunswick before 12am and get drunk.  We counted down, I kissed Sandra, we drank more, then I spent the night with her.  God I was nervous, but GOD! did she have a nice body.  Compare last year to this year and... well... this year sucks.

Why was I sleeping on New Year's Eve?  I only had three hours of sleep the night before and I had been skiing all day.  My first experience skiing:

Falling down sucks.
It is very difficult to get up (It seems I'm lacking the only muscle used in the process of getting up).
It's good to know how to turn before you find yourself going 30mph down a hill.
It's good to know how to stop before you find yourself going 30mph down a hill.
Running into someone at 30mph can be a very painful experience for both parties.
Once you learn how to turn and stop, skiing is fun as hell!

I had some trouble staying up at first, but after my first time down the hill I had pretty much figured everything out.  Stopping the first two times at the bottom of the hill involved bailing out (basically falling down).  Learning how to turn and stop was learned out of necessity.  My second time down the hill I found myself going much faster than planned, and the process of turning came almost naturally when I realized that my options where, turn now or crash into a tree.  It was quite exhilerating.  Stopping proved a little more difficult, but I eventually got the hang of it.  On my last trip down, I was trying to make the most of it so I was going very fast.  Halfway down the hill, a middle-aged man decided to spontaneously move into my way.  It was a truly terrific crash in which we both lost our skis and found outselves sliding to a painful halt 20 feet away from our initial impact.  We slowly collected ourselves muttering appologies and continued on our way giving each other plenty of room this time.  All in all, it was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to doing it again soon.


PD is buckling down and finishing Sky once and for all.  For the next three weeks, we'll be doing Sky almost every day to get everyone in our linkshell everything they need so we can focus on other things.  This means I need to get my Rdm a few more levels and open up Sky so I can get my gear before it's too late.  Of course we may go back to sky eventually, but that may not be for a long time.

Other than Sky, we will continue to do Limbus every three days.  We're 1/3 of the way to another Ultima attempt.  I've collected 32 Ancient Beastcoins at this point.  I need one more item to upgrade my AF hands to AF+1, which would cost 20 coins.  Or I can simply save up to 75 for the Brutal Earring which is a truly better item.  I can always get the AF+1 later.  I have no doubt we'll beat Ultima and Omega our second time around.

I've decided Ninja will be Selene's second job.  The main reasons being; I want a job that can wear God gear (like Kirin's Osode), leveling Ninja will help cap my parrying skill, Ninja looks like a fun/challenging job to play, a lot of my gear for Thf will overlap my Ninja gear, and Ninja is a very useful job to have for a endgame ls (there are simply times when Thf is not needed).  I was thinking about Monk while seeing as it's just a badass endgame job, but it simply doesn't have many purposes and it needs a lot of expensive gear.  Seeing as Mike hasn't been playing much, I need another job to level.

I've got about 4.5mil to my name right now.  I recently dropped 7mil on an Evasion earring, which will be a nice piece of gear for Ninja when I level it.  I'm thinking of buying a Ellusive earring for about 4mil for the sake of perfecting my evasion gear.  Then I'll buy whatever else is necessary for leveling Ninja and start concentrating on getting endgame Rdm gear.

Z and I camped three NMs last night.  First Manes of course, which unluckily killed us and depopped.  A little disheartened, we decided to try a Raptor NM named Lindwurm.  After an hour or so he popped.  It looked really badass and put up a impressive fight.  It attacked so damn fast, Z was more of a healer than a nuker while I did my best to tank it.  We finally killed it and it dropped one skin (500k).  It was more worth it for the fun than the money.  After that we decided to try to farm the pop item for a Lizard NM named Tarasque.  Again, after an hour or so, we got the pop item.  We were really worried about how difficult the NM would be, but it was an incredibly easy, almost disappointing, fight.  It dropped one skin (1.5mil).  So even with the defeat from Manes and the crappy drops, we had a lot of fun and made a 1mil each.  KSs were dropping like crazy too.  I completed the night with 9 Kindred Seals and 7 Beastmen Seals.

Z also mentioned that he wants to put together a group of 6 people to do Tatami Shield and Uggalepih Pendant runs.  It would be purely for profit, and if it comes together, there will be a lot of profit.  It's also nice to know that Z groups me with the leaders of PD seeing as 4 of the 6 members in this group are officers."

"event","Another Christmas has come and gone.  Not that it means much to me.  It never has.  My family has always had a light celebration of Christmas, partially due to monetary contraints, partially due to religious concerns (which seem to wear away as my parents get older).  The Christmas tree is the only decoration and presents are few(if any) and always something practical.  The only person who I can always expect a present from is Grandma, although once I reached a certain age she resorted to a card with $50.  I don't mind a frugal Christmas, family means a lot more to me than gifts.

I did see a lot of family.  We gathered on Christmas Eve (as we always do) at my Grandma's for dinner and presents from/to Grandma.  Grandma busied herself making sure everyone had more than enough food (as usual).  I ate quickly to make room for those who didn't get a chance to sit down at the table yet and found a niche with a glass of wine.  The wine was bitter, so I sipped sparingly as everyone settled down to open presents.  Zack and Naphtali put on a great show of excitement over their presents which was very enjoyable for everyone.  I got my $50 (of course) and Boxers (too small).  The night winded down and eventually we headed home.

We got home late, so I didn't do much else but read and go to sleep.  This was one of the few time that everyone in the family spent the night at our house in Little Egg Harbor.  We were hardpressed to find everyone a place to sleep.  I shared the bottom bunk with Josiah, while Silas got the top bunk (as always).  I read several chapters of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before going to sleep.  It's a much more childish book than I remember, but I think the movie was very well done.

I woke up at around 9am, ate breakfast with the family, then opened presents.  Once again, Zack put on a impressive show of excitement.  One of his gifts was a Tai Kwon Do (sp?) uniform for the classes Mom had signed him and Josiah up for.  This is a perfect gift for them I think.  Zack immediately donned his new uniform and struck several poses for the camera.  Zack will love learning a martial art and I think he'll be very good at it (his groin shots are already deadly).  I got bed sheets and some sort of special pillow (practical huh?).  I spent the day eating leftovers, playing DDR, reading, and watching movies with the family.  All very relaxing.  Silas and I drove home Sunday night.


FFXI, let's see...

Prices are outrageous.  Any expensive item that has a decent demand has doubled or trippled in price.  I'm not sure what is causing the inflation all of a sudden.  I understand the basics of supply and demand so I'll try to break this down a little.  Supply hasn't changed at all, the number of sales are the same as always.  So the only other thing that can cause the prices to rise like this is a rise in demand.  Why is there more demand?  My only guess is that somehow many people are all of a sudden obtaining large amounts of money.  So people who originally were too poor to contribute to the demand on an item are suddenly contributing to the increase in price.  How did they get this money?  IGE (a company that sells game money (gil) for real money (dollars)) is having a holiday sale.  You can purchase 1 million gil for around 5 dollars.

IGE employees Chinese gamers who will play FFXI for the sole purpose of monopolizing resources and earning gil.  They are nothing like normal gamers that will get their drop and move on.  IGE employees plague all rpgs.  They make it much harder for a honest gamer to have fun playing a game.  And the worst part is, players spend their real money to keep this company in business.

IGE pays Chinese employee $1 a day to farm gil in FFXI.
Player pays $5/1 Million gil to IGE.
Player buys item that has been monopolized and price-inflated from IGE for x gil.

Therefore people buy this gil for real money, then give the gil right back to them!  It makes me sick.  Hopefully prices will drop after the Holiday season.

I've been leveling Rdm a lot lately.  I'm up to 67, but I'm putting off leveling anymore to give Mike a chance to catch up.  Although he hasn't been playing at all lately, so I'm considering just leaving him behind.  Now that my Thief has just about everything gil can buy, I'm looking forward to getting some nice things for my Rdm.  But levels come first.

PD has now attempted Proto-Omega and Proto-Ultima each once.  Both attempts were close calls, but failures.  The recent one, Omega, was a battle limited to 30 minutes.  Advice from forums suggested a few strategies that were very wrong and caused the first 10 minutes to be very hectic.  After almost wiping, the battle was limited to two steps forward, one step back til we ran out of time.  We had him down to 6%.  I'm sure we'll kill him next time.  But that won't be for 7 weeks or so.  Still, Limbus is fun and has other rewards.  We'll be attempting Ultima again in 3-4 weeks, which I think we'll win this time.  Last time we took him down to the equivalent of 8%.

So PD still has alot to look forward to.  We're continuing to be successful in Sky, although attendance it pretty bad.  We're taking down pop item HNMs to get some members some nice gear.  Sea has been put on hold it seems.  Limbus runs are still rolling along with good success.  And we've taken a decent number of ground HNMs.  We're planning on killing some dragons soon, which means a Dragon Harness for me hopefully.

On top of all this, gil has continued to roll in for me.  Mana Barrels have been a great source of income.  A few Habetrots and several stacks on Gold Beastcoins have helped as well.  Sozu Terberry hasn't dropped for me for the past five kills.  Which is a shame because the Light Spirit is now worth 1.5mil+.  On top of this, Z and I have been killing Manes on a regular basis.  All in all, other than the prices, everything is going well."

"event","I took the trian to Philly last weekend.  A long overdue trip that manifested itself the moment I found out Rich was home and visiting Philly as well.  I had a good time of course.  There was plenty of interesting people to meet.  It was kind of odd though.  They were all so different, yet somehow so alike.  Maybe it was just the atmosphere that seems to wear off on the residents of South Philly.  It's hard to describe.  Anyway, we had plenty of alchohol among other things...  Which is good in and of itself, but what felt most important to me was seeing my friends.

I got home late on Sunday night and went to sleep almost immediately seeing as the effects of the weekend had not quite worn off yet.  I woke up earlier than usual to catch the train to work.  Why didn't I drive to work?  It seems I've left something out...

My car died.  It was just another normal drive home from work and there I was thinking, ""My car is driving much better today, maybe this piece of junk will last another year or so.""  But as I slowed down on a hill approaching a red light, the engine just stopped.  There was nothing I could do to get it started again, so three hours later it was finally being towed and I was walking home very cold and wet.  Of course I was hoping it would be a quick fix, like a distributor.  But as it turns out, it needs a new timing belt and starter, which would cost upwards of $500.  My car would be lucky to be worth half that.  So until I get a loan and buy a new car, I'm stuck taking the train.

Anyway, Eric was kind enough to pick me up at the train station at about 10am.  So I finally get to work at 10:15 and as I walk in, this guy named Tom Hutchinson says something to me.

This fucking guy.  He's about 45 years old, looks like a hick, is extremely unkempt, and has probably never been laid in his life.  He talks about everyone behind their backs but smiles to their face.  Everyone knows what he says though, but are too afraid to say anything, so they just smile back through their teeth.  From what I hear, he happens do know someone much higher up in the company, so he can't exactly be fired.  I've always ignored him, he never really bothered me, or had a reason to.  People told me he called my ""Clark Cunt,"" but I could honestly care less, he never talked to me and visa versa.

I can't exactly remember what he said, but he referred to me as ""Ishmael"" and referred to Eric as my mother for being nice enough to pick me up at the train stop.  Apparantly he was also worried about Eric making up the FIVE minutes it took to pick me up.  I don't know why, I'm not usually confrontational, but I didn't let his comment slide.  Here's the ensuing conversation as best I can remember:

""What did you call me?""
""Uhhhhh.... Ishmael.  huhuhuh""
""What the hell!?  Are you kidding me?""
"".....""
""Are you trying to make fun of me?""
""Uhhh, you're name isn't Ishmael?""
""No, my name is Israel, you know this.  Come on, say it with me, Is-ra-el.""
silence
""Say it with me... IS-RA-EL!""
silence
""So Eric is my mother eh?  Do you have a problem with him picking me up?""
""Well... it's taking time out of his day...""
""FIVE minutes!  Do you really care about five minutes?""
""Still, he has to make up that time.""  (keep in mind this guy is by no means Eric's boss)
""He'll just take five minutes out of his break then.""
""He doesn't get a break.""
""His lunch break!""
""Uhhhh, I guess.""
I walk away leaving him there mumbling to himself.

This is the first conversation I ever had with this guy.  Trying to make fun of me like he even knows me.  I hoped I had put him in his place, but his type continues right on, just not to your face.  Today I find out that he's printed out the definition of ""Ishmael.""  I have no idea what his intentions were, but this shit is really pissing me off.  I could care less if it was someone I knew just being jovial about it, but I don't know this guy, but I do know he thinks he's funny in a malicious way.

Tom does this to everyone who works here, and they all tolerate it.  They're actually in fear that if they do confront him or his boss, they might end up getting fired.  Just because he knows someone higher up.  After confronting him the other day, everyone seems to look at me in a different light, seeing as before that I was just a quite little intern.  Eric said I looked like I was about to hit him.  It feels like everyone else here respects me more because I did exactly what they want to do.  I guess I have less to lose than them.

I wish I could say I accomplished something by confronting him, but he's just the same as before, even worse with this new shit he's trying to pull.  When I saw that he had printed out the definition of ""Ishmael,"" I didn't hesitate to get up to confront him again about it, but Eric managed to stop me insisting that I'd endanger my job in doing so.  Eric managed to convince me it's not worth it, but I'm not going to let this slide for much longer.  I don't know where this is going to lead, but perhaps I'll find out exactly why everyone is so afraid of him."

The Ways.  Constructed for the Ogre by the male Aes Sedai while they found sanctuary in the Ogre Steddings just after the Age of Legends.  The Ways are entered through Waygates found just outside every Stedding throughout the known world.  Inside the ways, you travel from platform to platform which are connected by ramps that curve in every direction having nothing perceptible to hold them up.  On each platform is a guidepost which directions written in a language only Ogres can understand.  The Ways contort time and space, allowing one to travel far distances in a very short time.  However, the male part of the One Power, Saiden, that was tainted by the Dark One's death stroke, is the same power that was used to construct the Ways.  The same tainted Saiden that eventually drove every male Aes Sedia mad.  So the once bright and pleasant Ways slowly decayed to their present form.  They are now dark, so dark that even light brought into the Ways is absorbed by the darkness in a very unnatural way.  The platforms, ramps, and even the guideposts are all in a terrible state of decay, making it difficult, or even impossible to find your way.

And worst of all is the Machin Shin.  The Black Wind.  Borne of the Ways.  The manifestation of the taint that has corrupted the Ways.  It eats souls, a fate worse than death.  The only warning is their accursed song.  A song that screams into your ears and penetrates your entire being with hopelessness and fear.  The only way to escape is through a Waygate.  And even if you do escape, having heard Machin Shin's song can leave the greatest man a quivering madman."

I try not to let my meaningless life affect me, but sometimes I just feel depressed.  There are weekends where I'll wake up after a decent night of sleep and just lay there thinking about would I could/should do that day.  Only I don't feel like doing anything.  I just don't care about family or friends or... anything really.  I just go back to sleep.  I don't care.

These days are entirely wasted.  I don't exist during this time.  I do nothing, and I like it.  I usually feel better for it.

"event","I missed work the other day.  Silas got hurt and had to go to the emergency room.  He was playing raquetball without goggles on and was hit directly in the eye by a particularly well hit serve return.  When I found him in the ER, his eye was all puffed up and black and blue.  He was very unhappy, a little unresponsive, and in a lot of pain.  It turns out that the concussive damage had cause his eye to bleed in the cornea.  He was waiting for an on-call optomitrist to come to treat him.  His friend that gave him the injury was there looking almost as unhappy as Silas.  I talked to the nurse in charge of him and let him talk to Mom on the phone so that she would feel a little better.  I talked to Silas for a bit longer, but ended up going home after he insisted that I should still go to work.  Silas ended up calling me later that night telling me that the optomitrist never showed up and that I'd have to call out of work to take him to the doctor in the morning.

Silas looked like he was feeling better in the morning, although his eye still looked pretty bad.  The car ride threw him for a loop though.  By the time we got to the doctor's office he was in a lot of pain and feeling very sick.  I think that the pressure inside his eye threw off his equilibrium and made him very sensitive to light, sound, and movement.  I felt really bad for him for taking twenty minutes to fill out the required forms.  Finally get got in to see the doctor who gave him a pill to reduce the pressure and made him stay for further observation.  (It's a good thing I remembered to bring a book.)  It turns out his eye wasn't as bad as the ER originally thought, but he was dangerously close to damaging his vision in his left eye.  There was a little bleeding inside the eye, but it had stopped.  He was told to take it easy for the next few days because any exhertion could cause his eye to bleed again and lead to complications.  Overall, we found out that the damage was much less serious than originally anticipated which was a huge relief.  I'll be leaving work early today to take him to the doctor again.


FFXI continues to be eventful.  We beat Tenemos Central 3rd Floor on our second try the other day.  It really came down to the wire when we had the last boss down to 20% when we saw our 5 minute warning.  Everyone hit their 2hr abilities to take him down quickly for the win!  We're plannning on taking down Ultima this weekend depending on attendance.  Then we'll begin our trek through Appoloyn(sp) towards Omega, and hopefully some Homam gear for me.

I stepped up my farming the past few days to make the last few million for my Dusk gloves.  I actually have 6.55 million right now, and 300k on the way.  Dusk gear continues to increase in price though.  I was hoping to get them for 6.5mil, but I think I'll be lucky to get them for 6.7mil.  At least my Mana Barrels are selling quickly again.  I was beginning to think of them as a undependable source of income.  I guess I just overstepped some sort of economical boundary by pushing the price to 300k.  I dropped them to 200k and they're selling instantly again.  I'll let the price sit around 200k for a while and then slowly push the price up again.

Other than that... I beat the first X Hunter BC with Kya, which brings us a step closer to getting X's Knife.  We also camped Serket but didn't get the claim, a group of rmts got it...  We ended up watching an impressive display of mpk attempts by the other group of rmts that was there, which was worth a few screenshots.

Seeker and Nalia stepped down as officers of PhoenixDown last week.  I guess they were just tired of dealing with greedy people that cared more about getting ""their"" drop than the functionality of PD as a whole.  Mrzifear seemed depressed about it when I talked to him.  He almost made it seem like PD was broken without them.  I really don't want PD to break, so I tried to convince him that this just gives other aspiring members a chance to step up.  I subtlely mentioned that I would like the opportunity to become an officer myself and threw a few other names up in the air that I think would make good officers.  Still, I think it'd be best if Seeker and Nalia change their minds.  We'll see what happens..."

The biggest news is that PD is doing Dynamis again!  I was very discouraged after Disquonamis disbanded after I had been with them for almost three months with nothing to show for it.  I'm much happier doing Dynamis with my linkshell though, that way each drop we get actually means something to me.  We did our first run yesterday, which went much better than I expected.  We started with Dynamis-Jeuno which just happens to be one where I still need a AFv2 drop.

I was the puller of course.  I did a very good job as always, and was complimented several times.  Jeuno is the easiest dynamis, and we had a lot of people who had no experience with dynamis at all, but we still did really well.  Aside from a few deaths here and there, the run was flawless up until the NM that spawns the Jeuno Boss.  Unfortunately, people didn't know about respawns which lead to links, which lead to a wipe.  We recovered, but ended up wiping a second time on a pull that resulted in a lot more mobs than we expected.  At this point we only had 10 minutes left and considered the run a loss.

Still we learned a lot, and got the following drops.

Wyrm Finger Gauntlets x 2 (one went to Ranoik and the other free lot... meh)
Assassin's Poulains!!!  <<< Mine!
100 Byne bill

I'm so psyched that I've gotten my third AFv2, and finally a useful one!  It will probably be a while til I get any more, but the only one that really matters comes from Dynamis-Xarabard, which is too far to ever worry about.  The funny thing about the Poulains is that I had thought that if they dropped I would be ablet to lot uncontested.  So when I lotted for them, I didn't even to bother to look at my roll(957).  It turns out I was really lucky I rolled so high because someone else ended up lotting too(923).  whew...

Let's see... what else?

We won a second Tenemos-Central, which means we only need one more chip before we fight Ultima.  We though we had lost the Limbus run when we were having trouble killing a Carbuncle with two Light Spirit pets.  It turns out it was normal to have trouble with it because it was the Boss, we just didn't know it.  So when we finally killed it, to our surprise a chest popped and we were zoned out.  The situation went from a depressing loss to a unexpected victory!

Other than that, I've done quite a lot of farming lately.  I was finally able to buy my Dusk Trousers for 6.3mil the other day(a 200k discount) and my bankroll is already back up to 2mil.  My next purchase will be Dusk Gloves(6.4mil), then 2x Ellusive Earrings(2mil each), then 2x Merman's Earrings(500k each), then maybe Spectacles(~5mil), we'll see.  It looks like it won't be long til I reattain my former glory, only with a Thief's knife this time.

We've got another Limbus run and my first Jailer planned for tonight.  It seems like there's always something to look forward to.


Real life... do I have one?

I drove home again last weekend.  I had previously promised Josiah, Zack and Naphtali that I'd bring them to Great Adventure.  I found out later that it had closed, so instead I just gave them a whole day.  What we did the entire day was their call.  We had a lot of fun.  I like being the fun older brother, I like making people happy.  I spent a lot of money, but it was worth it.  Here's the play by play:

IHOP for breakfast ($35)
Froggers - Roller Skating & Arcade ($40)
Bowling ($40)
Mall ($100 for gifts, $20 for lunch)
Movie ($35)

Wow, $270...  It was still worth it.  I still owe Garland for her birthday, she'll get her turn next time I drive down.


My car started to make more noise than usual last weekend.  I was really worried it was something serious and I'd have to get a loan or something to buy a car.  The noise didn't seem to affect the performance, so driving home was just a little annoying.  I got Erick to take a look at it the other day.  We popped the hood and literally, within 10 seconds the problem was fixed.  A tube that recycles the exhaust from the engine had popped off from the pressure.  It turns out this also dampens the sound from the engine.  So we reconnected it, and that was that.  Definitely a huge relief."

"event","I woke up two hours early this morning.  Only I didn't realize it until I was halfway to work.  Uncertain of what to do at this point, I just continued driving.  I didn't go to work early though.  Instead, for some reason I drove to the mall.  The stores weren't open yet, but I wasn't planning on buying anything.  I just walked.  I don't know why, but I just walked around.  And for some reason it was extremely relaxing.  I watched the mall come to life while I aimlessly wandered.  I guess it was a good atmosphere to do some inward thinking, which I do a lot.  Although I'm not even sure of what I thought about.  Anyway... I enjoyed it, and I think I might do it again."

I drove home again last weekend.  Seeing as it was my 22nd birthday, I figured I'd go see family and friends.  It turned out to be a good trip, although with more driving than I had planned.  My family celebration for my birthday ended up taking place at my Grandma's on Sunday, which meant driving halfway back up to New Brunswick.  After which I drove back home for Sunday night til Monday night.  I had taken Monday off work seeing as it was my actual birthday.

It was good as always to see my siblings.  They are always so happy to see me, gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling.  I try to act like the big older brother, although I don't really feel like it.  I promised I'd come home again this weekend, but I don't think that will happen, maybe next weekend.

It happened to be Will's birthday as well, so I spent Friday night - Saturday afternoon at Natalie's for his ""party.""  It wasn't really a party, we just got to hang out like we used to.  Josh and Lauren were there as well as Will and Natalie of course.  I was disappointed to hear that Kyle wasn't going to show up.  We watched parts of some movies and played a few of rpgs.  It was great playing the soap-box carrying, fanatically religous Paladin Silas.  The name suits the character perfectly I think, even if it is my brother's name.  I've rarely had so much fun playing a D&D rpg.

My party at Grandma's went well.  I'm not too psyched about turning 22, but I smiled for the camera and made a birthday wish before blowing out the candles... yeah right.  I was in a rush to leave, but I didn't make it obvious.  Even so, I managed to get on my way back to Tuckerton at about the time I had planned on already being there(8pm).

I called Josh a few times but got now answer, so I assumed he was already on his way up to New Brunswick.  It was getting late already anyway.  So I called Mike and headed over to his place.  I had been meaning to introduce him to Naruto, an very good anime I found out about recently, which is why I brought my computer with me.  We set up my computer and connected it to his tv.  We broke out some Dr. Pepper and enjoyed a few episodes.  Since it was already getting late, I went home after a little while and got some sleep.  I woke up at 11am the next day and we just continued out intermittent Naruto marathon.  We only managed to watch about 17 episodes though because we decided to watch the Family Guy movie and Advent Children as well.

The drive home was boring as usual, at least my car doesn't feel like it's going to die anymore.  I just need to install that damn cd player.

I got home kinda late, but managed to log on FFXI to check in after a week of absence.  I didn't miss anything major, other than Limbus and Dynamis.

This week I've actually devoted most of my time on FFXI to rebuilding my bankroll.  Farming in Temple of Uggalepih is actually quite satisfying because there's so many ways to make gil there.  Even if I'm unlucky with one source, there's three other sources of gil that still make the farming run rewarding.  It's also nice to be able to help people that don't know their way around.  I know pretty much everything about the zone, and I often find myself asking people if they need help with anything.  In all I've made about 5mil in the past few days.  There's not much left for me to buy back after selling everything for my Thief's knife, but what is left has gotten very expensive.

Work has been pretty busy lately.  Once again it's one of those times when all of a sudden there's ten things I have to do.  I still take it easy though, one of the reasons I love this job so much is because it's relaxing, and I intend to keep it that way.  I'm trying to squeeze in some extra hours here and there for some extra cash.  Lately, I've only been making as much as I need to survive.  I should open another bank account just for saving money.  It's too easy to spend it when you have a debit card.

After quickly getting lost among all the names and locations in book 11 of the Wheel of Time, I decided I'd just continue from where I left off.  My original plan was to re-read all the books before book 11 came out, but I only made it halfway through book 3.  So now the plan is to read them all through again, no matter how much I'd like to just read book 11.  I have them all in Word documents here at work, so I'll have plenty of time to read.


I feel guilty about all the time I've wasted so far today, so I'm going to actually do some work.  And maybe an ISC... who knows?"

"event","I finally re-activated my cell phone the other day.  It was a lot easier than I thought it'd be.  I simply walked into the Cingular store at the mall, and quite literally walked out five minutes later with a working phone.

Not having a phone for almost two weeks really isolates you.  I haven't spoken to my parents, my brother, or any friends this entire time.  Other than those I talk to online that is.  I need to get out more, I feel trapped in this routine.  I'll be running with Josh tonight, I need to do that more.

I'll be helping Erick with his fence this afternoon.

My sister just called me by mistake.  That's right... ""the"" sister... the black sheep of the family that not only has fallen far from the tree, but has decayed to her moldy core.  She tried to make small talk after she realized it was me.  I surprised myself at how cold-hearted I can be when it comes to this sister.  The short conversation, in which my only responses were ""uh huh"" and ""yeah"" ended with her saying, ""I love you.""  I said ""ok.""  I'm not sure if there is anyone else in the world that I respect less or despise more, and it scares me that this person is my sister.


I finally beat Omega and Ultima last weekend.  It was an amazing fight that really pushed us to the limit of our abilities.  I won't go into the details, but we really performed well and finished the fight with a good 10 minutes to spare.  All in all, a very memorable fight... the cheers of victory are still ringing in my ears.

There were several cut scenes and easy fights after that, and I finally stepped foot into the new zone, ""Sea.""  It's a very impressive zone with entirely new mobs and beautiful sights.  We explored around a bit, killed a few things, and did the next mission.

By reaching Sea, I was able to join my linkshell in the new Limbus zone.  It was shorter than expected, but extremely fast paced and fun.  It sucks that we can only do it once every three days.  The drops from this new zone leads to a lot of new amazing gear.  I'm looking foward to more Limbus fun.

I also did some farming with Kyahadu, Solodayz and Mrzifear the other night.  We had no mage to heal us, but we held our own pretty well, although with a little downtime.  We got a few nice drops, and the mobs were a welcome change from the norm.  It was a good challange and I see a lot of farming in the future."

Party setup:  Paladin(Galadriel), White Mage(Nekotess), Red Mage(Spoonybard), Black Mage(Cormy), Ranger(Subzero), Thief(Me).

This is a three tier fight that brings a new level of difficulty to FFXI.  Everything else we've done so far seems insignificant compared to this fight.  Here's a description of what we're up against.

Tier #1

5 Mammets:
Sleep and Gravity don't affect them, which makes kiting them difficult, which is difficult anyway due to lack of room to run around.  Bind does work pretty well.  The annoying thing about Mammets is that they can randomly change their job so you don't know what to expect.  On top of that, they have an extremely annoying move that causes any melee damage to heal them for about 20 seconds.

Tactic:
We tried a few different things, but this is the tactic we settled on.  It works pretty well.
Everyone buffs up before the fight of course.  I run in first and draw initial agro from all five Mammets.  Spoony and Cormy both EM Bind one which takes 2 Mammets off me.  Subzero uses Shadowbind which takes a third Mammed off me.  Galad vokes one and starts tanking which leaves one Mammet on me.  At this point we each have 1 Mammet to worry about, but since 3 of them are bound and I'm evading mine, we can focus fire on the one Galad is tanking.  It is very important for us to take the first one out quickly.

After the first one is dead, we kill Cormy's Mammet since he has the most trouble kiting his and we don't want our Blm to die.  Spoony's Mammet is next, followed by Subzero's, then mine.

During this time Galadriel is simply choosing the targets, tanking, and DDing to the best of his ability.  Nekotess' only job is to keep everyone alive.  Spoonybard is occupying his Mammet, refreshing the mages, and helping to DD the Mammet we're killing if possible.  Cormy is occupying his Mammet and DDing as well.  Subzero is kiting his Mammet and spamming Slug Shot/Sidewinder.  I'm simply doing my best to keep the hate on Galad and DD the Mammet we're currently fighting.


Tier #2

Omega
He has a lot of hp, a few aoe attacks, a frontal aoe attack, and a move similar to Throat Stab.  All in all, very annoying.  I cannot melee him due to the aoes, so I have to stand as far as possible and spam ranged attacks for tp.  We each have an item called CCB Polymer that, when used, keeps Omega from using any special moves for about 30 seconds.  So we have a total of six to use.  But we want to save as many as possible for Tier 3.  I figure we can use one or two when Omega starts spamming attacks at 20%.

Tactic:
We buff up first of course.  Galadriel runs in and take initial agro.  I run in behind him and land a TA.  I continue to TA and SA when they're available.  Other than that I spam ranged attacks for tp.  When Sub and I have 100% tp, we execute a Distortion skillchain.  During this time Nekotess and Spoonybard are keeping Galad alive.  Cormy is nuking, stunning and filling in some cures as necessary.  Galadriel should be using potions so that the mages don't take too much hate from curing.  Once Omega is down to 25% or so, I'll use a CCB.  Hopefully we can kill it in the next 30 seconds, if not Subzero will use a CCB as well.  This will leave 4 CCB and everyone's 2 hour ability for the last Tier of this fight.


Tier #3

Ultima
Seeing as we haven't reached Ultima yet, my knowlege is limited.  I do know he has a few aoes that will paralyze, slow and petrify.  This fight should be similar to the Omega fight.

Tactic:
Buffs first etc...  Come to think of it, I don't see how we will handle this differently than the Omega fight.  Everyone stays out of aoe range but Galadriel.  We'll focus on getting him down to 40-50%.  At this point let's assume we have 4 CCB left.  At 50% we should have Galadriel use Invincible and use our first CCB.  This will give the mages some time to recover some mp and give Sub and I time to built some tp.  We will execute our skillchain, hopefully with a magic burst at the end.  This should bring him down to 30% or so.  We use our second CCB, Galad's Invincible is running out at this point.  Subzero and I use a Icarus wing.  We execute a second skillchain.  The previous CCB should have about 15 seconds left at this point, and Ultima should be down to 20%.  Sub and I build tp for one last skillchain, we use a third CCB.  This skillchain should bring Ultima down to 10% at the very least.  At this point Spoonybard Chainspells and starts spamming nukes.  Cormy uses Manafont and nukes to the best of his ability.  Subzero uses Eagle Eye Shot.  Nekotess uses Benediction as necessary.  I'll just try my best to DD as well.  If all goes well the last 10% shouldn't be too difficult.  I've left room for error in this plan seeing as we only use three of our four CCBs.


This is what happened last night.

We gave it a good effort, but after 5 tries we didn't get past Omega.

1st fight:
Wiped after killing 1 Mammet.

2nd fight:
Wiped after killing 2 Mammets.

3rd fight:
Killed all 5 Mammets without anyone dying.
Got Omega down to 30% or so before the mages were one-shot with Guiding Missile. We need to keep the mages spread out and keep Blink up for that.

4th fight:
Wiped after killing 1 Mammet:
Three of the last four decided to become Blms. We just got unlucky on this one.

5th fight:
Killed the 5 Mammets, but Spoony and Cormy died. We need to make sure we kill Cormy's Mammet second.
On Omega, we were doing ok til I got one shot by Guiding Missile while setting up for a WS. Shame on me for not having my shadows up. Galad had more trouble holding hate. I need to hit a TA every 60 seconds and Galad needs to use potions to ease the hate the mages are getting by curing him. Sub and I need to coordinate our skillchains better, I don't think we made one distortion chain either time we fought Omega.


We have a very good chance of winning tomorrow though. Mammets shouldn't be a problem. Omega is going to take a little more coordination. Sub and I need to keep our shadows up and stay out of aoe range as much as possible. The mages did a good job of spreading out the second time we reached Omega. We just have to get him to 25% and use a CCB or two to finish him off."

"event","""Think of it this way.  The bell is about to ring for the fifteenth round, and the Light is so far behind on points the only way to win is a knockout.  Our boy is game, but he's wobbly on his legs and bleeding from cuts over his eyes.  Now he has three minutes to pull out his best stuff and deliver the punch of his life.  The Dark One has taken a few shots, but nothing that has really damaged him.  He's still dancing on his toes and talking trash.  His head shots can fracture a skull, and his body punches can break ribs.  And now he's ready to unveil his surprises.  You didn't think all it would take is for Rand to show up at the Last Battle, did you?  According to the Prophecies, the Light has no chance without him, but his presence doesn't ensure victory, just that the Light has a chance.  Gotta stiffen your legs and blink the blood out of your eyes.  Gotta suck it up and find that punch.  Three minutes to go, and you gotta find that knockout.  That's your only chance.""

With book eleven of the Wheel of Time coming out today, I've been browsing some WoT forums to see what people are saying.  Surprisingly I came upon a blog in which Robert Jordan answers readers questions on a daily basis.  He ended one of his posts with the preceded quoted paragraph.  Even though I'm in a quiet office I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I read this.  I'm really looking forward to this book and the end of WoT, and this description straight from Robert Jordan's mouth, makes me feel... giddy... for lack of a better word.  I shall be picking up Knife of Dreams after work today.  I won't be costing me a dime thanks to Bruce, the safety program at Hess, and all these lovely gift cards.


My cell phone has been disconnected for the past few days.  My parents, for some reason, decided to give my little sister a cell phone.  The plan was to give her Mom's cell phone number, seeing as she lost her cell phone long ago and never really used it.  Dad, Mom, Silas and I have been sharing a family plan.  However, due to a mix up, my sister recieved MY phone number instead of my Mom's.  So my phone was disconnected and anyone who tries to call me reaches my sister...  Dad assures me that he'll take care of it quickly, but I'll probably be phoneless for a week or so.  Maybe I should take the hint and get my own cell phone, I could use an upgrade.  But then I'd have to pay for it...


A update came out for FFXI yesterday.  There's a lot of new content, but the greatest part about it is the new Thf/Drg/Pld/Drk set.  On top of being the coolest looking set of armor I've seen so far, the stats are more than I could have hoped for.  For example, the body armor has +15 Acc, Enhances ""Triple Attack"" effect.  Every other piece has +3% Haste and +3-6 Acc as well.  Godly..."

"event","Bruce just gave me another ""Safety Award Gift Card.""  If I've never mentioned before, Hess is a very safety oriented company.  This is all well and good for the lab technicians, they handle dangerous chemicals all the time.  But for me, safety doesn't really come into play.  There's not much I can do to hurt myself sitting at this computer in a quiet office.

The annoying thing though is that Bruce has a hard on for safety.  Safety is his job.  He forces safety on us in every aspect of our job.  We are supposed to have a certain number of ISCs(Individual Safety Contacts), and TIPPS(I have no idea what this is an acronym for) entries inputed every month.  During the entire time I've been here, I've done 3 ISCs and 0 TIPPS entries.  It's a good thing Bruce isn't like my boss.

Bruce is absolutely the opposite of confrontational.  I consider myself shy, but compared to Bruce, I'm outgoing.  On top of that, he stutters a lot and has a lot of trouble getting to the point on any issue.  So let's say I ask him a yes or no question.  From any normal person I'd get an answer within 10 seconds at most.  In Bruce's case, it could take upwards of 2 minutes... for a yes or a no.  Now imagine trying to carry a conversation with him...

So anyway, back to the topic.  Bruce's work-life revolves around safety.  He wants everyone to care about it as much as he does.  And he's relatively successful in this respect.  I, however, am his one failure.  I just don't care, I don't see how it applies to me.  I try to care sometimes, but I'm just to lazy.  Hence, a total of 3 ISCs in almost a year with Hess.  Technically, that's not even enough for one month.  Even so, every month Bruce hands me a gift card for my participation in his safety program.  Of course he's not going to say anything.  I feel bad.  But I'm too lazy to change, and I'll just keeping getting these gift cards.

I was given the illustrious task of pulling in Dynamis last night.  Luckily no mistakes were made, the entire run went well.  I'm not sure I like the new rules, seeing as I'm much less likely to recieve any AFv2.  Or at least not quickly.  I'll stick it out anyway I guess.

"event","So I was leaving for work this morning and realized I was starting the same old drill that ended last May.  Where the hell did the summer go?  Meh...

I should call Silas and tell him we're going to do a 20 mile ride on our bikes.  The 25 mile Pocono mountain trail we took last weekend wore me out, but I've been hyped to get back in shape since then.  Unless I can get my brother on my ass to get on my bike, I probably won't do it.  I'm disgusted at how far I've let myself degenerate.  I want my old endurance back.  I want to run a five minute mile again.  I'll start with a little bike riding I guess...

So I'm sitting here in the office with Cake playing a little more quietly than usual.  There's a meeting going on in the library with a lot of important people so I can't enjoy my music at the proper volume.  Kathy wasn't here this morning so I had to do all her annoying tasks, which included getting up to press the button than opens the door every 5 seconds to let the people for the meeting in.  Why can't they just all come at the same time?  I guess that's asking too much.

There's nothing incredibly pressing that I have to finish today.  I finally finished the Monthly Report by staying an extra two hours yesterday.  Granted it's already the middle of September, but I have to finish it sometime.  It's just incredibly irritating to do that report.  My brother wrote the visual basic macro back when he had this job and it's incredibly rudimentary and picky.  I have to make sure everything is just so before actually running the macro or it fucks up and forces me to go back a few steps.  Well, it is complex in it's own right, but I could have done it so much better.  I could start from scratch and make it correctly, but that would involve a lot initial work which I don't really have to do.  So until I start feeling industrious, or my boss actually tells me to do it, I'll deal with the irritation.  I'd feel bad about erasing my brother's hard work anyway.  I remember when he was first showing me the ropes here, he was so proud when he showed me the Monthly Report.  He spent a lot of time on it and I'd hate to undo it.  If I do ever rebuild the report, I'll try refrain from boasting about it.

Damn, these four hour days go by fast.  I hope I can survive on twenty hours a week paying for rent, utilities and food.  I should be ok, my only problem is that I spend money when I have money.  I actually don't notice much of a difference when I have less, I just waste less.  It's a bad habit, one that I'll have to break if I ever want to buy a decent car."

I gave Juicymama 31 Million yesterday, which leaves me with 9 Million more.  I had 2 Million more as of last night.  I just want to pay JM off so I can start making my own money and start re-equipping myself.  Once I have my Harness back I may try to get the real drop from Sozu with Nani.  I'm just really happy now, more happy than I imagined.  Especially after selling so much of my equipment.

"event","I've recently came to the semi-final decision to simply earn the 40 million gil I'd need for a Thief's Knife.  I am 0/36 on Sozu and trying to camp him is hard enough on top of dealing with his crap drop rate.  Over and over I hear about people getting their knife in less than ten kills, and it drives me crazy.  So I decided enough is enough and simply buy it.

I got up to 2 million and I log in the other day to check my sales.  I see Juicymama, a long time member of PD and friend, shouting, ""<Thief's Knife> 50 Million <Do you need it?>.""  At first I'm sitting here and thinking... is this a joke?  So I casually ask him if he really has the knife.  Sure enough, he does.  Apparantly he was in the area of Sozu Rogberry looking for a Prelate Key(which I have helped many people get over the course of camping <<>> karma my ass) and got the claim and drop... 1/1.  My first feelings were anger and jealousy.  It's so unfair how I could spend real life DAYS trying to get this knife, and he just randomly gets it.  My response at this point was, ""Yeah, I'm logging off now...""  JM knows perfectly well how much time I've invested in getting this knife, and he didn't say one fucking commiserating word.

I didn't log off.  40 Million for the Knife is price gouging in and of itself, but 50 Million was out of the question.  So I told JM I'd buy the Knife for 40 Million, expecting him to be nice and lower the price a little more for me.  The response I got was, ""ok.""  I had to beg him to promise not to sell it while I gathered the money.

40 Million is a lot of gil...  I have to sell so much of my best equipment.  Just starting the selling process was extremely painfull.  I remember getting each and every item I put up on auction, and now I'm trading all of that for one item.  The one item that has been the bane of my FFXI existence.  It's probably not worth it, but I can eventually work myself back up to my previous glory.

In the end, will it be worth it?  Probably not for me.  Some of you might think this is a selfish thing to say but, I think this is an incredibly selfless act.  I might gain some of my 40 Million back because I own this knife, but this is for the benefit of Phoenix Down and my Dynamis linkshell more than it is for the benefit of myself.

40 Million is easy to say, hard to understand.  Let me spell it out.

Scorpion Harness(5.4 Million)
Dusk Gloves(4.5 Million)
Dusk Trousers(4.7 Million)
Spectacles(3.0 Million)
Evasion Earring(4.3 Million)
Merman's Earringx2(1.0 Million)
Leaping Boots(1.2 Million)
Emperor's Hairpin(1.2 Million)
Genin Earring(.4 Million)
War Gloves +1(.7 Million)
Amemit Mantle +1(1.4 Million)
166 Dynamis currency(~2.5 Million)

All on top of what I had in hand and several other minor items.

All worth TH3 for Phoenix Down?  You tell me."

I'm really happy about getting a raise, but what makes me feel bad is that Erick has worked here for over three years and has never once gotten a raise.  It's not that he's this amazing employee or anything, but he has been here a lot longer than I have and I'm going to be making more than him?  It doesn't seem fair...  I don't think I'll tell him about this.

When I got home from work yesterday I immediately put together an exp party.  I got a good Ninja that happened to be in my last exp party, then managed to get a Brd and a Rdm, which is a great start for a party.  I wanted to get two Blms for the last two spots for a semi-manaburn party, but ended up with 1 Blm and 1 Mnk(extemely pimped out).  Although we had a couple delays, we exped for a total of 4.5 hours and got 30k exp.  I used my three merit points to give myself Triple Attack +2."

"event","I won Dynamis Beaudicine last night with DisquoNamis!  It was much faster paced than any of the City Dynamis' so it was quite exciting.  The organization of this ls is only average, but the leaders knew exactly what they were doing and lead everyone well, so there was almost no wasted time.  We were amazed to see three AFs drop in the first 3 minutes, and proceeded to find 3 more over the course of the run.  No Thief AF though... *cry*.  It would have been mine as there was no one to lot against me.  We ended up with the following AFs: Whm, Blm, Smn, War, 2xMnk.  I guess the most important thing was getting the win so I can go to Dynamis Xarbard.  We're doing Dynamis Jeuno on Thursday, which is good because I can get my last City AFv2 there.  I'm looking forward to it.

In other news...  Last night as I was about to log out, Mrz showed up and made an announcement.  Although I've been mostly oblivious, there has been a problem with people not getting along with other members and not showing up for events.  So Mrz wants to clean out the ls and start from scratch.  He's really serious about it too.  He completely cleaned out our forums and layed down some new rules.  I'm assuming the old pearl is broken by now.  He started a thread where old members can request to get in the new PD.  But I'm assuming the final decision as to who gets in lies in our old leaders:  Mrz, Slide, Theseeker.

I don't know if this was completely necessary but it might be for the best.  I'm interested to see who doesn't end up in the new ls.  I can think of quite a few people that in my opinion don't deserve to be in PD.  I think we'll be more focused as a linkshell if we consolidate our members and get rid of the ones that ask for a lot but don't contribute."

"event","My weekend was fairly eventful.

Friday:  Kirin was cancelled because Theseeker and Nalia had a power outage and had all the seals.  Kalena and Ramset managed to get me Kreutzet's ToD which left me camping at 2am.  At first it was just me, Wasaba and Vite(Nani), at which point Rich called me.  So I talked to him for almost an hour mostly afk.  When I was done talking to him, I finally notice that we now have ten people camping with me!  I was feelin' the love.

The window finally opens and an our or so later Kreutzet spawns.  We beat the two other parties camping and won the pull.  Thanks Galadriel.  We had a couple links on the pull... for shame Galad.  But after he zoned the Cockatrices, I agroed them and pulled them back into the open area and used Hide to get rid of them.  We also had a Manticore link, but Theseeker managed to keep it sleeped.  I think it was killed eventually, I don't know what happened to it.

We killed Kreutzet very easily, seeing as we had plenty of manpower.  I asked to get the last hit, so everyone disengaged as I hit him with a last Shark Bite and proceeded to see him drop my Sirocco Kukri!  It's about time seeing as I was 1/3 and just about everyone else I read about get it on their first kill.  I played around with my new dagger a bit before logging off for the weekend.

Saturday:  I woke up around 1pm and sort of hung around until 4pm or so.  I thought about camping Sozu for a while, but there was way too much competition so I settled for a shower before driving down to Tuckerton.  My poor car cries in protest every time I take a trip home, but I buzz along at a cool 75 mph in fourth gear, my car's highest gear...

When I got home, only Grace and Gabrielle were there.  Gabrielle was still sleeping as usual, and Grace, seeming overly cheery and happy to see me, was on Dad's laptop talking to five friends at the same time.  This is a little disconcerting because two weeks earlier I had password-protected Dad's computer after re-installing Windows because he wanted to keep the kids off his computer.  I guess Dad will never learn...  I hung out at home for an hour or so before heading down to Absecon.

I had earlier declined John's invitation to drive to Philadelphia to see his new place for a few reasons.  First, it was obvious that his unerlying motive was to get me there so I could give him a ride home.  Which turned out to be him and a ""few friends.""  It's really hard for me to turn down a friend like this when a favor is asked of me, but.. the train is right there!  Also, I'm not enthralled about the idea of picking up a bunch of strangers in Philly to bring them to Tuckerton, even if they are John's friends.  Lastly, I'd rather not put my car through any more pain than I have to.

So I picked up John in Absecon and we go to the Mall.  I don't know why, I guess I wanted to be more than just a taxi ride.  I'm his friend after all.  So we walked around the Mall for a bit, got something to eat, and I picked up the new Cake cd.  Then I drove him back to Tim's place where Bobby and Matt were.  It was getting late by that point, so I only stayed to say hi before I headed back home.

The kids were being put to bed, but were as always happy to see me.  I hung out with them for a while while working on Dad's laptop.  I downloaded the drivers for his Wireless network card and got that working and installed Microsoft Antispam before getting bored.  Everyone was asleep, so I watched tv til 3am or so then finally went to sleep myself.

I had forgotten what is was like trying to sleep through a morning in the Clark family.  I was mostly unconcious, but I vaguely remember plenty of yelling and screaming.  Mom crying, dad yelling at mom... etc.  This all probably happened between 9-10am, and when I woke up at 1pm, it all seemed like a dream because is was so quiet now that they were all at church.

I had planned to hang out with Mike at this point, but he was still at work so I decided to do some much needed shopping.  It's funny how I was finally nearing $1000 and all of a sudden so many things happen to drain it away.  First my Dad asked for $200 for car insurance, then my car gets towed and I end up paying $200 for that, and now I decide to buy some much needed clothes.  I ended up spending $250 on an entire wardrobe of Jeans, Kakis, shirts, undershirts, and boxers.  Considering this will hold me off for at least another year, I guess I'm getting off light.  I've just never spent so much money on clothes at the same time...

By this time Mike was home, so I headed back to his place with a case of Dr. Pepper, like old times.  It's been a few months since I've seen him, and damn, he's lost a lot of weight.  It seems like all my more heavy-set friends are losing weight where I'm gaining.  He had moved everything up into his bedroom, which was wierd because I had never seen his room before.  We always would hang out in his Den downstairs.  We sat down and watched some Slayers, which was highly enjoyable as always.  I don't know how I missed that Koala joke all the other times I've watched Slayers... it was worth a good laugh.  As it was nearing 10pm, I decided it was time to head back up.  My car started crying again...

I felt kinda bad about missing Sam's party on Sunday.  But I drove all the way to Tuckerton, and I didn't want to leave without even hanging out with a friend or two.  MaryBeth is ""pissed,"" but she just wants to make me feel guilty.  Erick seems convinced that I was ""humping"" all weekend, which is why I chose to miss the party.  I simply blushed when he mentioned it(as I do whenever anything regarding sex is mentioned), which lead him to believe that it was true.  Meh, I'll let him believe whatever he wants...  but God help me I wish it was true.

Wow, narrating my life is a really lame way to keep a journal, but at least it takes up a lot of time.  Which is good because that is the purpose of this journal."

"event","One of the benefits of working for Hess is that I can order anything I want from the cafeteria in any quantity and only pay three dollars.  I never actually go there because someone at the Lab here usually just takes everyone's order and brings the lunches here.

Today I'm craving a breakfast-type lunch, so I order a porkroll egg and cheese and a couple cookies.  This is one of the few times I actually made a special order that wasn't on the lunch menu, but the Chef there is really cool about stuff like this.  So I'm expecting a moderate sized lunch when it gets here...  Along the same lines as the sandwiches I used to always get back home at Bagels and Beyond, but I was in for a surprise.

This porkroll egg and cheese has no right being called a ""sandwich.""  If I may borrow a word from Futurama, this thing is definitely a ""Manwich.""  It may all be in one bagel, but there's enough egg here for at least three.  And there's six, count them, six... layers of porkroll in this Manwich!  The first words out of my mouth when I saw it were, ""Holy crap!""  I think that's the best way to describe it.

Oh yeah, I ordered a ""couple cookies"" too right?  Well I got a white paper bag along with my Manwich, filled with cookies...  So yeah, this is a pretty crazy lunch considering it only cost me three dollars.  I'm halfway though this Manwich and I'm feelin' pretty happy."

"event","The Big Boss has been on vacation this week, so my slacking has been turned up a notch.  Almost to the point of feeling guilty about it.  But then again, it's very obvious that everyone in here has been working less.  I guess it's a normal reaction due to a lack of leadership.

I think I'm gonna drive home this weekend.  But maybe not til Saturday night because my ls has some more CoP planned that I don't want to miss.  I want to visit some friends that are supposed to be home.  I guess I could just see how John is doing, he'll be living in Philly again this Fall, so I'll need to visit him there at some point as well.  I need to watch some Slayers with Mike as well.  My roomate had a cd with four episodes and I feel a strong need to watch more.  Oh yeah... and I want to visit my family.

FFXI:

The other day I was invited into a new Dynamis linkshell called Disquo Namis.  This was through no effort of my own, they simply asked me to join.  It seems they just lost a few Thiefs recently and needed an experienced backup puller.  I fit the criteria, and they were desperate, so they waved the normal four runs before you can lot rule.  I will be joining them today on a Dynamis-Windhurst run to meet everyone and get a feel for how good they are.  The leader already practically promised me a Dynamis-Beaudicine win, which would open up Dynamis-Xarbard for me.  The way they have the schedule set up is Beaudicine/Xarbard on Mondays, and the Cities on Thursdays, which will actually fit in well.  Well, as best as I could hope for anyway.  Fri-Sat/Sun is pretty much devoted to PD.

I guess I actually have two Dynamis linkshells that I'm welcome in, because I still have my Plutocracy pearl.  If one doesn't work out, I can always fall back to the other.  Hopefully in the near future I can show off a full set of AFv2.  Dynamis also gives me a good chance to make myself known.  If PD every falls apart, which has nearly happened a few times, it would be a good thing to know people from other HNM Linkshells."

"event","Well, the other night I had the sudden urge for Taco Bell.  Having nothing better to do, I hopped in the car and headed out.  Knowing that I'd want some Dr. Pepper with my meal, and that Taco Bell no longer provides the god of drinks, I stopped at a random convenience store to pick some up.  I got back in my car an continued on my way, but forgot to turn on my headlights.  I realized this once I was out of the well-lit area I was in and turned them on as I approached a red light.  A man on a bike seemed quite resolute in catching up to me at the light for some reason.  I waited at the light for a while, and the man on the bike pulled up to my driver's side window.  It was a cop...

Now the thing I was worried about was the bright red ""REGECTED"" inspection sticker that I have been driving with for over a year.  But as it turned out, the cop didn't even say anything about that.  He seemed a little more concerned that my registration was expired.  My father is the technical owner of my car, so apparantly the registration renewal form was sent to my home address.  Well, my registration had expired last month and even though I was only around the corner of my house, he insisted on towing my car.

Now, I've usually been let off easy in my past, but this cop decided to come down heavy-handed.  In retrospect, I'm pretty sure he said something about not giving my a ticket for my headlights.  But I ended walking back to my house with a ticket for Failure to Present Registration($180) and Failure to Use Headlights($54) on top of the towing fees($100).

So, instead of coming home with delicious Taco Bell, I came home empty handed(exept for the Dr. Pepper I had picked up) and $334 in the hole.  And on top of that I was forced to call out on Monday.  Luckily, my Dad drove up and I managed to get my car registered and pick it up from the Towing company.

You know what the next thing I did was?  That's right, I went to Taco Bell.  For some reason, as I sat at home eating my delicious tacos, Mexican pizza, and empanada, I didn't feel distraught about the whole ordeal.  All seemed right with the world once again.  Was it worth it?  No, not really...  Have I learned my lesson?  Probably not."

"event","Ever since the start of High School, I've always had a computer game to be addicted to a computer game.  I've never been very social, and thank god I have friends that gave me reason to go outside once in a while, but I've always had a game to occupy my time while at home.

At first it was Command and Conquer: Red Alert.  Then by Sophmore year of HS, I was introduced to a MUD called Multi-Users of Middle Earth(MUME).  A MUD is a online multiplayer RPG that is entirely text based.  I know, sounds kinda lame, but it was actually a lot of fun to play.  In retrospect the thing about it that I liked the most was the entirely player-based PvP action.  There was not arena where you'd go to fight a person playing and Orc or Troll, you just ran into them while exploring.  I remember logging in in Bree once to find it overrun with Orcs... good times.  Eventually I ended up moving on about a year later.

I introduced myself to Final Fantasy VII by randomly picking it up at Wal Mart one day.  I played it through twice once I got it, greatly enjoying it each time.  Little did I know the role that Final Fantasy would play in my life later on.

By mid-Junior year, I was introduced to Diablo II.  This was my first real addiction.  It was a pretty cool game in that there was a lot of gear to accumulate, and a lot of ways in which to develop your character.  I played this game for over a year til it finally degenerated to doing quick Mephisto runs with my magic-find Sorceress by the hundreds.  Basically, there happened to be a quick way to reach and end boss in a certain area, which could be easily defeated.  So you'd accumulate all this magic find gear and kill Mephisto over and over for good drops.  And I accumulated quite a bit, but as I lost interest, the game itself went to shit.  Hacking got entirely out of control and the economy was completely ruined.  At this point I decided it was time to quit.

Surprisingly, I went an entire summer without any game to be addicted to at this point.  I remember thinking that it'd be nice to have a game to look forward to, but nothing stood out.  A friend at work introduced me to Everquest(or Ever-crack), but it never caught on for me.  Graphics were choppy and low quality and I was a little overwhelmed with all the content.  So I couldn't really enjoy it.

And then, as November approached, my friend Mike mentioned Final Fantasy XI.  He had been looking forward to it and counting down the days to the release for months, and I didn't even know about it til a week or two before the release.  Then one day I came over his house and he was playing it.  With a little urging on his part, I immediately drove to the mall to pick it up.  I then came back to Mike's with my computer, as I would end up doing a lot in the coming months, and installed FFXI.

It's a beautiful game.  Great scenery, great graphics, exciting action, many interesting plotlines.  Everything seemed so controlled, in comparison to Everquest, and I liked it.  The addiction set in rather quickly as I leveled with Mike over the next couple months.  One thing I discovered about it is that it's a very.. social game.  Very early on it forces players to work together toward a common goal, usually experience.  The teamwork required in previous games was insignificant compared to the level of teamwork needed in FFXI.  I quickly developed friendships in-game and they seemed to take precedence over the game itself.  It wasn't all about exp and gear, sometimes it was just about helping people out or just talking.

I never seemed to spend a lot of time in-game with Mike.  At first he always seemed to be a step or two ahead of me.  And try as I might to catch up, I couldn't.  I was playing Red Mage at the time, and he was playing Monk.  But at some point, Mike lost interest in Monk and started a new character, which seperated out levels even further.  We'd still talk in-game and stuff, but we took different paths and each found a different people to hang out with.

Eventually I started a new character as well because I wanted to play a Mithran Thief.  Since by this time I was a level 54 Rdm, I knew what I was doing and quickly progressed through the levels.  Before I knew it, my Red Mage became a thing of the past as I was enjoying playing Thf so much.  Eventually I made my way to the end-game activities, where I finally caught up to Mike again with his level 64 Dark Knight.  I had managed to get into a HNM Linkshell by this point and recommended Mike for membership.  Much fun was had.

Shortly after joining the linkshell however, Mike decided to take a break from the game.  One thing that I haven't mentioned about FFXI is that it is very long.  I guess he was feeling bogged down.  So after this point, for the first time I moved past Mike on to bigger and better things.  He came back for a few months and leveled Monk again, but then ended up leaving again.

The only reason I'm mentioning all these details is because Mike was the one looking forward to the game for so long, and whatever game he plays he plays well.  And I sort of always looked up to him in that respect.  I was thown into the game spontaneously and was always a step behind.  But now at this point I was looking down at him, and this was the last thing I expected.

So here I am, having played FFXI for almost two years.  I've done a lot of what there is to do in endgame, but there's still so much more.  And SE keeps adding content.  Did I mention it's a long game?  I have no idea how long I'll end up playing, but it'll probably be a good deal more.  Maybe Mike will show up again one day and I can go back and level my Rdm with his Mnk.  It'd be fun to do the missions again and see all the cool cut scenes.  Plus, it'd be really convenient to have two high level characters.

Eh, that's a decent summary of my gaming experience.

Oops, I forgot about Star Craft... yeah I played that too around the time I stopped playing MUME.  It was a good game.  So many games against Rich.  So many victories, so many backstabs.  Good times.  Yeehaw!

Work is over now.  I can go home.. yay for weekends.  Gonna drink on Sat, good times will be had by all.

Kinda tapered off at the end there.  Damn, still haven't finished my camping trip story.  I'll do that later.  What a long rambling entry... I should probably proofread, but I won't."

"event","Well, here I am at work again.  I slacked my way to lunch, then did some work, now I'm slacking some more.  Believe it or not, slacking does get boring.  And seeing as I'm too bored to write anything interesting, I'll write about what I do at work.

I work for Amerada Hess as a ""BOL Intern.""  BOL or TIMS(which I'm more familiar with) is a database used to store all the data recorded by lab technicians.  I actually work in a building called the QC(Quality Control) Lab where the tests are done on many different types of oils.  So basically all this data is recorded by the technicians in a program called WinBliss, then I have to organize this data and update the BOL Database with it.

I have a few reports that I run every morning that compile certain parts of the data into a readable form.  These reports are all done in Excel.  So I take all the raw data from WinBliss and put it in a Excel sheet.  No bells and whistles here, just a bunch of cells with numbers in them.  Then I write a macro in Visual Basic that takes the data I need and organizes it so that anyone can glance at it and quickly find out what they need to know.  For example, I run a Sulfur report that among other things allows the reader to compare the WinBliss sulfur content value to the BOL sulfur value to make sure it's up to date.  Half of the reason for me to run this report is to let me easily update the BOL Database with the WinBliss data because it lets me see which tanks need to be updated.  I have four other reports that I run that work basically like this one.

At first, it took me at least two hours to complete all these morning reports.  However, I now know all the shortcuts and can run them with perfect efficiency in about 20-30 minutes.  Only I choose not to.  I make a point of not mailing out the report til 10am, that way everything thinks they're actually supposed to take that long.  If I make it seem like I'm doing a lot of work, I won't be given more.  It's good logic and it works.

To fill in the time I check the news/weather, read up in my favorite forums (ffxi.allakhazam.com, killingifrit.com), check my e-mail, or read a book which I have in a word doc(currently The Great Hunt).  I don't have my own office, so I have to be sort of discrete about my slacking.  Although I doubt anyone would really care, other than my boss.

Other than my computer slacking, I'm expected to go ""work"" with Erick, a sort of handiman that works here.  His main job is to wash all the bottles that the oil is sent in.  << sidetracking:  Oil is sent here from around the country is these sample containers.  The technicians use about 10% of the oil in the bottle for tests, the rest is waste.  >>  So Erick dumps all this oil down a drain where all the different types of oil stew together in a tank.  I think they re-use it somehow.  But it's still a little annoying to dump gallons and gallons of premium gasoline down a drain when your car is sitting in the parking lot with a perfectly empty tank.  After he dumps the oil, he then has to put them in a washing machine(kinda like a dishwashing machine), then boxes them.  Now as I already mentioned, I'm expected to help him from time to time.  Only he slacks just as much as I do.  So if I get bored of the computer, I can just go bullshit with him for a while.

So I mix in a little of everything and the day goes by pretty quick.

More about my exciting work day tomorrow!"

"event","Wow, the past couple days here at work have been far from normal.  Normally I can do my limited amount of work at my own pace, with plenty of slacking in between.  But all of a sudden I have three different people giving me things to do.  A lot of the time I'm lucky if I can think of two or three things I ""could"" do, but don't really have to.  Right now I can think of.. hmmm.. four things I ""have to"" do right now.  Well, I guess that's why they call it work.  I'm not complaining, I really shouldn't be saying anything considering the amount of effort it takes to make twelve dollars an hour.  I mean, I spend at least half the day browsing forums etc.  It's just been really busy lately, that's all.

I guess I should pick up where I left off with the camping trip.  Where was I?

Oh yeah, Frozen Balls!  Hmmm, what can I say?  I went from feeling like shit from the mountain climb, to not feeling anything.  Headache?  gone.  Burning arms and legs?  gone.  Basically you jumped in and lost all feeling within a minute or so.  I have to say I rather enjoyed it, because not feeling anything at all is quite a bit better than feeling like shit.

So, feeling a little better we headed back to camp where I felt well enough to eat something.  It was a little to early to drink, be we did anyway.  And boy did we drink!  I've been drunk enough times in my life, but I'd have to qualify most of those drunks as ""happy-drunk.""  Well, this was one of the few times I've been ""crazy-drunk.""  I won't go into the details, but let's just say that at one point I had a Throne, and if I had gotten any closer to the fire I probably would have gone up in flames.  Apparantly being crazy-drunk involves spilling a lot.

Luckily I was deterred from getting close to the because the flames were about 10 feet high, so we were all spread out pretty far away.

Wow, out of time again already.  Damn these busy days..."

"event","Well, I'm back from camping.  A mountain was climbed, some balls were frozen, some injuries were sustained, and much alcohol was drunk.  That pretty much sums it up, but I'll go over it in more detail seeing as I'm writing this because it gives me another way to waste time.

The first night:
We arrived at the camp site in the mountains somewhere in New York at about 5pm on Friday.  And by ""in the mountains,"" I mean we were actually halfway up a fucking mountain.  The ride up was... painfull, for my friend's truck that is.  When we finally got there, we quickly set up camp in a nice clearing right next to a stream.  After unpacking, setting up the tents, and putting the booze in the stream(yep, stream cooled alcohol is good), it promply started raining.  We struggled to set up a tarp with ropes and poles between some trees as the drizzle turned into a downpour.  Luckily, we construced our haven, complete with chairs, a stove, food, and booze before we were soaked.  So the drinking started...  An hour later, the rain stopped, so we relocated around the firepit and started a nice blaze with the help of some good ol' lighter fluid.  After almost lighting myself on fire, we gathered around the campfire and drank til we past out in our tents in exhaustion.  For those of you who haven't tried it, drinking around a fire is fun as hell!

The mountain:
Yeah, I know what your thinking..  How hard could it be to climb a mountain in New York?  Well here's the answer:  It's really FUCKING HARD.  Granted I'm a little out of shape, but I still have my cross country stamina.
The climb:
So we're climbing up this mountain, not much to tell about the way up.  My brother and our friend Rob quit about 3/4 of the way up.  i.e. Rob couldn't handle it and my brother didn't want him to go back alone.  I continued on with Erick climbing with my hands as much as my feet.  Reaching the top was one of the best feelings in the world.
The plane:
Now the destination is not only the top of the mountain, but the plane reckage that Erick discovered on a previous climb.  We found the reckage after about twenty minutes of seaching.  It must be from the 50's or earlier.  Only the metal parts of it remained, and the pieces were all spread out.  We found the engine about 100 feet away fromt he actual crash.  It was all very cool, very worth the climb.
The descent:
The trip up until this point was great.  I was very tired from the climb, but I was in pretty good condition all things considered.  Now, one thing we made a point of avoiding was this plant that my friend had encountered on previous climbs.  When this plant comes into contact with your skin, you itch furiously for about five minutes til it finally goes away.  Luckily we didn't see any on the way up.  However, for the trip down, Erick decided we would take a faster, safer route.  What he didn't know what that this would take us through fucking fields of these plants.  So try to imagine this:  You're fucking exhausted, you're climbing through fucking forests of these plants that make you itch like hell, the plants themselves are making it impossible to see your footing so you're falling on your ass and sliding every few steps.  Ok, so yeah... we were in a state of panic all the way down.  I hardly noticed the burning on my legs and arms because all the muscles in my legs wanted to cramp at the same time.  A few minor injuries were sustained, mostly scraps and bruises.  But we finally made it down, at which point I immediatly ran to the creek to cool my burning limbs.
I felt like shit for a few hours after that.  Feeling too sick to eat, I just drank some water before going to Frozen Balls.  Not a good idea...

I'm out of time for today.  I'll finish this tomorrow."

"event","My sleeping schedule has been really off lately.  Usually I can make a decent attempt at maintaining a normal/healthy daily routine.  However lately I've just been ""napping"" from the time I get home from work(5pm) til around midnight.  Then I end up just staying up til I have to go to work(7am).

I think what initially caused it was pulling an all-nighter as some point last week.  I've only done this two or three times on weekdays, and each time I remember hating myself for thinking that I could possibly be ok after just skipping 6-8 hours of sleep.  I end up trudging through my day sustaining myself with coffee and/or sugar.  Now as I've already mentioned, I did this again last week and ended up collapsing on my bed once I got home from work.  Since then I've gone to sleep once I get home from work.

I don't like sleeping my afternoon away, but my body refuses to function properly.  I'll try to fix my sleeping schedule by Monday.  I'm already sun-deprived, and this is just making it worse.  Luckily, I'll be getting my yearly dose of nature this weekend.


I'm going camping!  Yeah, I'm going to some forest-y, mountain-y place in New York with my brother and a few friends from work.  I'm not really looking forward to the whole nature part of it...  But we will be drinking... a lot, which I AM looking forward to.  There's also this lake called ""Frozen Balls.""  I'm guessing it's supposed to be cold?  I'm sure much fun will be had.

I will make FIRE and a Spear in the old Cross Country tradition.  I will defend our camp from the numerous chipmunks and occasional squirrel.  Maybe even a racoon!  And I will do this all drunk, yay!  Seems like a perfect plan, I can't see how anything can go wrong."

"event","Enduring another long day at work.  I figure I could use another way to help pass the time.  Hmmm, where do I start?

Hello.  My name is Izzy.  Or Israel if you want to get technical.  But I've been Izzy among my friends since third grade.

I was born in Illinois and moved with my family to New Jersy at the age of two.  After living with my Grandma in Hazlet for a year, my father became the pastor of the First Babtist Church of Keyport.  So I moved with my family into the church-owned house in Keyport, which is the first real home I remember.  We lived in Keyport for over four years, during which I made my first friends, was homeschooled(for the most part) by my mother, and lived the happy-go-lucky life we all enjoy during our early years.  We were forced to move when my father started having political problems with the church.  My dad has a few beliefs and ways of teaching that differed from the norm, which was causing problems.  Of course, at my young age I was oblivious to the reasons we were leaving.  My dad, having a large ego, refused to back down, and in turn was forced to step down as the pastor of the church.  This meant leaving the church-provided home we were living in.

The following move was entirely unplanned.  My parents had not saved much money, my mother was going through a depression, and we didn't even know where we would go at first.  Luckily, we found a winter rental in Spring Lake at a unrealistically low price.  I have to say this was my favorite place I lived as a child.  Although I didn't know it at the time, this was when my parents were having the most financial problems, but I was livin' it up.  The Boardwalk was a short bike ride away, as well as Spring Lake(yes, there is actually a lake there) and a park.  The area in general was much nicer than Keyport.  I actually started to go to public school at this point, where I started in Second grade.  I enjoyed school mostly because I was ahead of everyone else, so it was a breeze.  My mom had actually done a very good job teaching me.  Sadly, although I had a lot of fun living here, we were moving again before I even finished second grade.  Apparantly the rental price goes way up over the summer in Spring Lake.  However, the time spent there gave my parents time to find a new place for us to live.

So we ended up in Leonardo.  For you ""Clerks"" fans out there, this is where the Quick Stop from the movie is.  We moved into a big house with a big yard, which was a 10 minute walk from the Grade/Middle School and a park.  This was a great place to grow up, and luckily we lived here for over six years.  I started Third grade the following fall, during which the notorious name ""Izzy"" was granted.  My parents didn't like this name very much, but I was embarrased to introduce myself as Israel because by this point, my peers would actually know that this was not only a rare name, but also the name of a country.  Preferring not to be the object of ridicule, I welcomed my new nickname.  I had a little trouble making friends this time around, partly because my Mom decided to home school me for Fourth grade.  For those who don't know, while home schooling does have its perks, it's a good way to become socially detatched.  My parents had religios reasons for home-schooling me that year which I may talk about later.  However, I was back in public school to stay for Fifth grade.

We once again were forced to move when our landlord decided he wanted to sell the house.  My parents were unable to afford the purchase, so we were sent packing once again.  This time my parents found a small house in Mystic Island.  I remember thinking ""Mystic Island...  Wow sounds nice.""  It wasn't exactly what I expected, but the house was nice, although much smaller than what I was used to.  Going from three bathrooms to one in a large family is kinda hard.  Luckily, by this time I was in Tenth grade and not as dependant on my parents.

I found myself in a new High School(Pinelands), and although up to this point I had played soccer, for some reason I chose not to join the soccer team.  I guess I was a unhappy at this point seeing that I had just moved away from my friends and was suddenly thrown into an entirely new environment.  I've never been good at meeting new people so I was pretty much a loner for an entire semester.  There were people I socialized with, but no real friends.  The following Spring I joined the track team because my favorite teacher happened to be the coach.  This turned out to be the greatest decision I could have made, because this lead to many long lasting friendships.  I ended up doing Track and Cross Country for the rest of High School.

I had a lot of good times in High School, many of which I'm sure I'll recount here.  Most of the time, when I think about ""the good ol' days,"" I'm thinking about the time I spent with my friends in Pinelands.  Track and Cross Country, Dr. Pepper, my Buick, RPGs, trips to the Mall, days on end spent over Rich's...  Good times were had, I miss those days.

Sadly, High School was over before I knew it, and I ended up in Rutgers the following fall.  I never actually declared a major, although I always assumed it would be Computer Science.  As it turns out, I decided Computer Science wasn't what I figured it would be, so I've just been taking math, physics, business and history classes for the most part, in an attempt to figure out where I want to go with my life.

This entry is definitly winding down due to lack of interest.  It's a pretty good generalization of my life til now.  Definitely a lot more generalized than I expected.  I had this all in my head, with plenty of detail and humor, but I didn't start this to write a book.  Maybe I'll post again tomorrow... we'll see."

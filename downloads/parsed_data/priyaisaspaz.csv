"event","RA (resident advisor) training just ended. It was craziness. I was busy all the time- from 8 to 8, and then afterwards had to work on making stuff to put up around my hallways for my residents so I literally had no free time. One fun thing we did do was go on a little ""camping"" trip to Camp Wightman where we, besides for learning RA junk, ate smores, kayaked, swam..it was awesome. The whole week was intense, but now training is OVER and tomorrow I have absolutely nowhere to be and no time to wake up, which means that tonight...there is much fun to be had. ;)"

"event","Finally back in naptown where I have to drive (in my nonexistent car might I add) atleast 10 minutes to find reasonable food. Pathetic.
My little red jeep got towed to the mechanic today. I hope it comes back fixed- my fingers are crossed.
I went on vacation to PA at this resort, the Nemacolin. It was SWEET. The hotel we stayed at was called Falling Rock- they had a 24-hour butler service. The butler brought us cookies, tea, popcorn, chips- any sort of snacky thing- for FREE when we requested it. It was hot. The place also had one of those gorgeous rimless pools- where the water looks like it's cascading off the cliff it rests on (until you swim over and realize it's pouring into a gutter).
I got a facial which was ridiculously relaxing- almost fell asleep a few times though which was sort of unnerving and detracted a bit from the relaxation.
After PA I went back to New York mainly to see M.I.A. in central park- it was a concert held by summer stage, which has done a crapload of free concerts in the park this summer. M.I.A. is SO hot. I am as much in love with her as a straight girl can be. Needless to say, the show was rockin'.

Now I'm chillin' like a villain. Back to the same old, comfortable, beautiful routine of nothingness that is Annapolis.
Yay preppy sailors and corny ass punks...I've missed you so much...

Ciao."

"event","Translated from Hindi, Kal Ho Naa Ho basically means...tomorrow might not come. It's equivalent to the phrase I've heard a million times in English...""live life to the fullest"". But for some reason today when I looked at the translated lyrics of this song from one of my favorite Hindi movies...it struck me. Tomorrow might really not come.
If I died today, could I look back on my life and be proud?
I have so say no.
I have not been nearly dedicated enough; I haven't worked nearly as hard as I should have given what this world has offered me.
I feel like everyone around me is putting forth real effort whereas I'm constantly putting it all off until tomorrow.

Two situations I'll never forget that have affected me profoundly:

1. I was away at camp, my grandmother was in the hospital with cancer. My mom asked me to write a letter to her. I never did. She passed away shortly thereafter and I will never stop thinking that she thought I didn't care enough about her.

2. Last September, my grandfather, who moved to Annapolis after my grandmother passed away, and with whom I was therefore very close, was in the hospital with cancer. My mom gave me his phone number at the hospital to call him. I was too scared too, I didn't know what to say to someone who I knew was going to leave my life forever. I never called him and he passed away two days later.

It's acceptable when the decisions that I make in life affect me, but to think that someone wouldn't know how much I love them because of my own procrastination/carelessness/fear is the most horrible thought. 

Why I have absolutely no excuse to be lazy:
1. My grandfather is paying 40,000 dollars a year for me to attend Wesleyan, and I have not even begun to make use of the incredible resources this school affords me.
2. My sister is 24 and has secured a web design job at Circuit City headquarters without having a bachelor's degree, supported herself while paying her way through school getting an associates degree in Miami, and is now supporting herself in Richmond while starting up a business and attending VCU in the fall. She is the most motivated person I know and has made more of her resources than anyone I know.
3. I am intelligent and entirely capable of doing incredible things.
4. I am never going to be able to take back the years of my life, and in the end I don't want an empty scrapbook reflecting my missed opportunities.

I don't know what's wrong with me. Where is my passion? Don't I love anything enough in this world to make something of it- to dedicate hours of my days to it? I always feel like everyone has found their niche and I haven't.

Time to go be productive."

"event","Maybe I'll miss Picnic more than I thought.
I realized- I'm never going to see Noah again. I LOVE Noah- he's the greatest, such a sweetie. And..he's not going to be at Picnic even if I should visit again. So sad :(
Tonight was fun- worked with Sam & Paul- they're good people.
Waiters were *Claudio* (Argentinian dreamboat), Justin (also a cutie) and Noah (aww!). A good staff for the last time working at Picnic EVER! :)

My friend Malcolm once said that he feels like God is on my side. Now, whatever ""god"" one takes this to be...I sort of believe it. I've been pretty fucking lucky in life and I've been given a lot of chances I don't necessarily deserve.
An example of one of the mysteriously wonderful things that has happened in my life:
I had incredible guilt about the Antonio situation (""I am an asshole"" entry). Tonight- I just happened to have the random desire to walk from work to Caffe Swish (116th & Bway) and whom do I see on my walk but Antonio on a delivery for his new job! SO incredibly random that it's ridiculous. So I gave the adorable kid my number (he's 17 btw, which is still too young, and he still doesn't speak English well enough), making sure my intentions were clear. He still gave me the ""you're so beautiful"" lines, but atleast now I have a little buddy to chat with (even though we won't really understand one another...).

Came home and hung out with Emily- last night of roommate bonding because she leaves for upstate NY tomorrow. We watched some Sex & the City and the movie Hitch which is an AWESOME movie!

I love New York. Tomorrow is my last night. I'm gonna party it up.

"event","This weekend was incredible.

Friday night:

Hung out with Adit, his brother and their cousin. We went to sushi, met up there with this guy Jeremy from Wes. Then we hung out around the village for a bit trying to find a place that wouldn't card me. No luck...
My sis Angela and mom came into the city at 1:30 am.

Sat:
Went to the MoMA in the morning-it was awesome. I loved the architecture and design room- which was a display of everyday things that were designed awesomely i.e. the iPod, an iBook, really cool light fixtures, chairs, sofas, a car...etc.. Another of my favorites was an exhibit of Lee Friedlander's photography- which made incredible use of shadows and reflections, to the point where the photos looked as though they were multiple photos superimposed on one another. 

After the MoMA, we ate at a little French place, Maison, which was delicious. Then we walked around Greenwich village, did some shopping (well mostly just looking), then hung out around Washington Square Park. We ate at this great Indian restaurant, Baluchi's, on Washington Sq Place and 6th ave- it was SO incredible and I was more stuffed than I've been in a long long time. It was painful.

After that we went to Comic Strip Live, which was absolutely hilarious! The stage there is where Jerry Seinfeld used to perform his stand-up as featured on the beginning of his show. 

We then went to the Blue Smoke restaurant which had a jazz club downstairs called Jazz Standard. My sister's friend from highschool, Ian, works there, so he got us in and we listened to some jazz and waited for him to get off work.

Then we went with Ian and his girlfriend Amy to a lounge where we sat and chatted for a bit. After that we headed to this bar, Vertigo, which had a really nice semi-outdoor seating area. We were there until 4 am and didn't get to sleep until 5:30. It was a WILD night, but we had SO much fun. We packed in so much in one day, it was the greatest weekend!!

Needless to say, after all of this I am SO tired and in dire need of sleep.

"event","Had an interesting conversation tonight. Is the key to success in life really being fake enough to convince people you're exactly what they want, until you have enough influence/stability to break out and be what you actually are? Is short-term schizophrenia better for you long-term?
How this relates to my life:
Working for a magazine, especially in New York, requires that I meet influential, ""high-up"" people and laugh at all their unamusing jokes, treat them as though they are my lords and I merely their peons, and kiss-ass better than the competition (afterwards amusing myself with the idea that their conceit could be such that they truly believe they are as great as I say they are). Is this temporary, or is that constant feigned adoration a necessity in this world? It isn't that it bothers me that much- but one day will it get to me? I don't want to give up journalism because I can't handle a bit of pretending, but then again my biggest annoyance has always been people that aren't sincere. But maybe this sort of insincerity is admissible as long as I assure that it doesn't seduce its way into my personal life.

In any case, this semi-ready-to-please gal needs her sleep.

Ciao.

"event","Today this boy Antonio, who, until recently, worked with me, came into Picnic and asked for my number. I playfully refused to give it to him, but with no intention of ever revoking my refusal. He hung around for a bit, asked me again, met again with my refusal but also my disappointment at never being able to see him again since he had quit, then he left begrudgingly. He stood outside Picnic chatting with someone for around 10 min, staring inside and looking extremely sad.
I started to feel like shit. Not because I wanted to go out with the kid, he's 16 or something, and not because I think I've just done irreparable damage to him, but for the mere fact that I will never see him again in my life. This is something I think about a lot- too much probably- the fact that there are so many people in life with whom we'll cross paths, even if for brief periods, that we will never cross paths with again. Somewhere out there they are living their lives, coexisting with us, yet even if we wanted to, life would never permit us to meet with them again. It's just weird to think that, even though admittedly he had very little to do with my life, I will never see Antonio ever again. The same goes with Fernanda, who left yesterday for Mexico...the departure of such people in my life leaves the smallest emptiness in me especially because I know its an emptiness that can really never be filled because to fill it would mean to forever keep these small (and dare I say at the core, meaningless) connections. 
I hate thinking about things like that. I know that it's entirely impractical to mourn these sort of relationships- ones that I can say indubitably are OVER...versus those friendships and relationships with people that are somehow forever sustained simply because of practicality or enduring connections stabilized by our mutual community. That is why it's so hard to maintain these relationships- the lack of a mutual community, a common ground, a reason...is there too much difference between me and someone who works in the kitchen, is less well-off, has a completely different life story than me...for us to ever call ourselves ""friends"", for us to ever find a common place where we can both be entirely comfortable? I feel like our lives are too different for them to converge. Why can I thoroughly enjoy someone and their company, and have them feel mutually, yet never cross that unspoken boundary that prevents the development of a real friendship?
I'm thinking to myself- even if Antonio were older- would I still have refused him? Yes, he doesn't speak the best English, and this is reasoning enough, but is it deeper than that? I can't help but feel a bit...wrong...about it. I say a relationship like that would never work, but is that just the excuse of a classist? And with the horrible thought that maybe that's how I've grown up, and how most of our society has grown up, with these ideals of what <I> will </I> work and what <I> won't </I>...or excuses based on what we deem  practical or not...I can't help but feel like a complete asshole."

"event","This weekend:

Saturday- met up with a bunch of Wesleyan peeps at this kid Nick's house. It was fun, although a bit awkward because everyone there had lived together in the same dorm and I hadn't.
That night Meera, Karla and I got terribly lost trying to get to a train that would take us back to my apt. This is due to my unfamiliarity with the east side and the sketchiness of Central Park at night. We decided to take a cab over to the west side. Well worth the mere $5.80 we spent.
Sunday morning- work at 8...ew. Went to the gym (astonishing!!) with Lucy after work. We met up with Tess, Emily, Tomas and a bunch of their friends at this bar, Ding Dong. Semi-sketchy, but it was pretty nice, they didn't ID, and the pina colada was awesome. Afterwards- to Pearls for FREE BOTTOMLESS WINE...quite ridiculous and delicious.
Then- poker night at Lucy's. A few of her friends from highschool and colby came over, they played poker, I watched and formed long words out of Lucy's massive chip pile (which eventually deteriorated to nothing).
Mon morning- GYM again. Felt good about myself. We did this crazy weights class with this crazy instructor who liked to sing the countdown of our repetitions (eiiiiight, doo doo dooo doo, now seeeveeeen doo dooo... etc).
Yesterday afternoon- went to to library and FINALLY got maximum city- started it and I'm loving it so far. 
Also went to Barnes and Noble and bought SPANISH books. With Emily's help (and others when I leave new york), I am learning Spanish. It's not too difficult so far because it's a lot like french grammar wise, so the concepts aren't hard to grasp.

Next weekend-
Mom, Angela (my older sis), and possibly my two cousins are coming to visit!!

I have two articles to write this week so it's work work work from here.

First I work. (not the awesome part)
After work I meet Wesleyan people- including two of my favorites- Karla & Meera who will be visiting from CT and TX respectively. I'm so psyched to see them! Tomorrow night we're going to go to this girl Meera's (same name, dif person, she's the EGO Film intern) apt because she's having a turning 21 birthday partaay. So that should be outrageous fun. Then my girls are sleeping over!

Other exciting news: 
1. Home in two weeks!! (though I love new york)
2. MTV Desi interview was awesome, and I'm having dinner with the man I interviewed and my editor soon...which should hopefully help me gain some connections and possibly help me get a job there next summer.
3. I FINALLY finished this stupid contact info shit for EGO, it was SO easy and kind of fun too. 
AND here's the big one:
4. My mom is letting me take the ""extra car"" to Wesleyan next semester! This is a complete shock; previously she was very adamant in her refusal. I LOOOOVE this car, it was basically mine at home. Bright red Jeep Grand Cherokee Sport. Total piece of junk, makes the BEST noises that seem to indicate imminent collapse...but it's a good car.

Plans for the next week:
Work, make money.
Basement Bhangra Thurs night w/the babeilicious Promiti.
MoMA Friday (free admission!)

a goal- visit atleast 4 good, fun restaurants by the end of my stay here.

I wake up at 7:45 tomorrow. So - sleep time.

I came out and I was saying bye to everyone and Jean-Luc (the chef, one of my bosses) said ""you might want to go into the bathroom and fix your clothes"". I was wearing a lowish-cut shirt that showed some skin (because I had had plans to go out which were then cancelled) and so I thought he was making some reference to the fact that I shouldn't be showing that much skin so I said ""ha ha funny"". And then he said ""no, in the back, is it supposed to be like that?"". I reached back to my skirt and ALAS...my skirt was tucked in my underwear. This is the stuff sitcoms are made of...literally. I was thoroughly embarrassed. I immediately fixed it and BOLTED out the door. Terrible, SO terrible.

On another note- tomorrow at 4pm I conduct a phone interview for EGO with the head of MTV World, Nusrat Durrani. I just found this out though, and I have work all morning until 3...so I'm not really sure when I'm going to prepare questions and if I will in fact be able to prepare properly...a little nervous.

I was supposed to find out all of this contact information for the magazine, for this guy Dominic, who basically heads the print issue of EGO, and I sort of got really lazy and didn't contact people. I saw him tonight and he asked, ""so...how's that going"" and I admitted my lack of, well...having done anything. Though he and Ayesha understand I'm busy with work at the cafe making money, he wasn't entirely pleased. I am a horrible person. Ayesha relieved a bit of the embarrassment/self-loathing by telling me that she thinks I'm doing a great job with the internship. So yay.
On another note, for EGO I am going to write an article for the economy/politics section. I'm either writing about the new Iranian president-elect, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, or the resignation of Sandra Day O'Connor and the implications of said action. I'm actually pretty nervous about it. Both require knowing a lot of background information as well as being able to provide intelligent analysis..so we'll see how that goes. I think that will be my last article...then it's back to Naptown!
My mom, sister & hopefully two of my cousins, Niki & Lisa are coming to visit the weekend of the 23rd! So psyched! I haven't seen my cousins since Christmas time!

"event","Right now I should be working on my writeup for the interview I had with the women from Breakthrough, but instead I'm feeling pretty lazy and useless. Last night was pretty fun. Emily & I ate A LOT of food before fireworks...for whatever reason...
Fireworks were pretty good but I have THE WORST attention span; I just couldn't focus on them and I think Emily was getting annoyed with me because I just wanted to leave. I've started to think that the whole act of standing there with a huge crowd of overeager people to see a display I've seen 17 times in my life has become a little too trite for my taste. Also- maybe I would have prefered sitting down on the grass and having a complete view instead of one blocked partly by a bridge...but unfortunately that was impossible. Granted, the New York fireworks were better (toward the end, the grand finale) than those of Annapolis...so I definitely enjoyed them once they pulled out the really incredible stuff.
Last year's fourth of July was pathetic, I saw small sparks of color from behind an enormous fence which was behind a huge tree that stuck out over the water from a stretch of land. It was in Annapolis though! And I miss Annapolis!
Emily has gone to Jones Beach today with Tess. I wanted to go but I REALLY should be writing this stupid article and doing other work. I will get to it within the next hour. That's a good, accomplishable goal.

Ciao."

"event","Happy 4th of July! 
I was supposed to work at Picnic tonight..and thereby miss the fireworks (which I've been looking forward to ALL summer...I've never seen NY fireworks)...but Lucy and I switched shifts! Now my problem is figuring out a) where to go and b) with whom I should go.
This morning at Picnic was craaaazy. We were short-staffed thanks to an absent-minded skinny Swede. Ryan, who has never waited tables before, had to take over as a server. It all worked out, but it was pretty hectic for a while.
So I hung out with my dad, stepmom & little sis Saturday night. We went to their friends' house- Arnoldo & Agita (I think!). They have a little 6 week old baby name Alexander (Aleyho for short- a nickname that I LOVE and might steal for my children); he was a cute one- really alert, wide-eyed, focused. SO calm. I feel like Malaika's behavior when she was younger was fairly anomalous because unlike all of these calm babies I'm always meeting, she was absolutely wild!
After we talked for a bit at their place, we went to SEA, a Thai restaurant in the East Village. We went with the above mentioned people, as well as Rakhi & Nab (whose house in jersey we stayed at). Food was mediocre. I saw girl Christina from Wesleyan there though! It was so random! Afterwards, I thought I could convince my dad to let me go to Chay's friend's house, because we were all going to head home to sleep anyway, but he refused to let me go. In the time that I would've been gone (from about 10 pm to 9 am the next morning) I spoke probably five words to my dad. So...THANK GOD I didn't go out or we would've missed out on ALL of that quality bonding time.
Yesterday morning my dad, Chandrani, Malaika & I went to Picnic, got some cookies for the little tyke, and then checked out my apartment. 
Last night after work I went to Lucy's house, which is three blocks from Picnic. It was a fun time, met a lot of her friends. Ryan, Tomas, Tess and this busser at Picnic, Brian, were all there...so we had some major Picnic representation.
I went to sleep around 2:30 and had to be up at 8 today...which I guess isn't terrible at all really...but I'm pretty tired. My naps are becoming more & more frequent...
My first article is up on the EGO site and is apparently getting a lot of hits. (http://www.egothemag.com/archives/2005/07/bikinis_fit_for.htm)
I'm not entirely excited though because for some reason Ayesha didn't use the intro I wrote and I never received feedback on it. Hopefully I'll get that figured out.
Tonight: nap, meet with Ayesha (EGO editor), & celebrate the independence of this GREAT country...(yes, I'm being sarcastic, but no matter how unhappy we are with this country...I think we'll all enjoy the fireworks.)

Ciao.

"event","My dad, stepmom (Chandrani), and my little sister Malaika are visiting me in New York. Well actually right now I'm typing from a computer in Jersey where their friends Rakhi and Nab live. It's a sweet place, I hope I have this nice a place when I'm settled. Later we're going to head into the city, check out my place, and eat some Thai food (yum!).
I wanted to hang out with my friend Chay tonight whose friend Zaheen, whose parties are apparently infamous amongst his friends, is throwing a bash tonight. But instead it's Jersey for me. Oh well. :)
Sometimes I feel like living in the city this summer is a waste because I work 6 days a week, do work on my own on the magazine, sleep, eat and spend half my time on the subway....so what of the city have I really experienced? But I guess that's sort of the life people have to lead here. It's definitely fast-paced, and I love that. I just wish I could work less and have more money...but that doesn't make sense, does it?
Last night was interesting. Someone, who I have an incredible crush on, but is far too old and engaged, suggested we ""go out for a beer""...sketchy, or friendly? ( I KNOW it's just friendly, he's a good guy)
Time to take a nap...woke up at 9:30...went to sleep at 4:30 am (no...I didn't go partying...unless partying means waiting w/my roommate Emily and her friend for a subway for 30 minutes to go to a pizza place, giving up on it, meandering around looking for food for another half an hour only to come to the realization that our neighborhood is DEAD after 12, and then finally giving in to the lure of a cab and a 24-hour mcdonald's 30 streets uptown. Those were excellent chicken mcnuggets.)
On that note....

Ciao.

ps. my little sister is the cutest!"

"event","No idea <b>why</b> I've started this livejournal thing. Online is becoming a bit too much a part of my life...probably not the healthiest thing.
So right now I'm in NYC...I've been here for a month, have another month to go. Basically my life at this point consists of endless hours working at Picnic Cafe (fancy French place...I guess) being underappreciated but whatever atleast it is temporary...and I'm getting paid.
Yesterday I interviewed two women for the magazine (my purpose for being in New York is an internship with EGO magazine- South Asian art & culture publication). One of the women was the director of this organization Breakthrough, and the other a young woman working as a program coordinator for the NGO. It's a human rights organization focusing on sexuality, HIV/AIDS, immigrant rights & women's rights. From the interview and the website (breakthrough.tv), which are the only things I have to provide me with an impression at this point, the organization sounds really great. I would love to intern or even work full time for them in the future.
During the interview I was a little nervous though and could not articulate anything I tried to say. It's understandable since it's only my second interview but they didn't know that...and though all in all I did fine, I could have done better. I guess that's what practice is for. That basically shot my chances of working with them in the future though...
It's my most favorite person in the world's birthday today- Becca. I love her!! She and Luke, who's bday is the 2nd, are throwing a pirate themed party. Bet it will be kick-ass. Wish I could be there but unfortunately I have work...bleh.
It's definitely time to sleep now.

Ciao."

Roger Ebert says it was completely different from my expectations (gasp! TandI might actually have some weight?)

San Francisco Chronicle says it was completely the same. (lame. save your money)

Question now is:

Do I shell out the six fifty to go watch it? 

Nah.

Don't forget why you have monday off. Sit back and understand the magnitude of being able to have friends of all different races. If you're a racist, then fuck you.

"event","The Brothers Grimm:

""Look at this strapping young lad!""

""This is my daughter!""

""And a fine wife he'll make someday!""

lmao. and the ""he'll"" is not a typo.

People who have recently talked to me might have noticed that I can't shut-up about Four Brothers. So of course i can't write an entry without blurting everything out:

Movie: Four Brothers

Stars: Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000), Garrett Hedlund

Tagline: They came to bury their mother... and her killer.

Review: This movie actually got me confused the first time (yes I watched it twice in a row) because, believe it or not, there is a lot of business stuff involved. Stuff about having to pay off business partners who shut them down, blah blah blah ( i won't say which brother gets caught up in this the most). It plays out like an old western in the end 'cause there's a ""showdown at high noon"" type of thing. But then again this movie is based loosely on a John Wayne movie so this is to be expected. I really liked this movie because it's funny, it has great music, it has great shooting sequences and the guys are hot! The brothers aren't gun-toting idiots who shoot people 'cause they want to, though. Their only objective is to kill their mother's killer. My only problem with this movie is that the characters are soooooo underdeveloped. We get a mini-profile of each of them and nothing else. ( in age order from oldest to youngest) Bobby Mercer just got out of prison (why he was in prison in the first place is a mystery). Jeremiah Mercer is the only brother doing ok, has a house, a wife and two daughters. Angel Mercer is an ex-marine and they mentioned that he wanted to get away from his life so he joined (why did he want to get away? idunno). Jack Mercer (and my favorite) is a ""first-class fuck up and a third class rocker""(Officer Greene) lololol. But apparently, ""they""(who's they?) did some ""horrible things"" to Jack before he was adopted by Evelyn Mercer (the mother). What are those horrible things? No clue? Then again, i suppose if they put in all of that the movie would be four hours long instead of its two and a half.

Bottom line: Far from being Oscar-worthy, but definitely worth the 10 bucks you'll spend to watch it."

(mind you the face was kinda fuzzy). So I just shrugged and went on to read. I had just finished an article on endangered species of bears when I turned the page and there was (in all his beautiful glory) a one-page spread of Ralph Fiennes. *drool* I think I stared at that picture for a good ten minutes before I realized there was an article about him next to it.

"event","""MAKE ME 200 CAPPUCCINOS AND BRING ME THE BEST ONE!!!!""- Will Ferrell, Bewitched

Hahaha, that looks like a fun movie. Not getting great reviews though. shrug, anyways. I am free from July 4 to July 8. After that, I'm busy two weeks straight. Anyone wanna go watch Bewitched and War of the Worlds with me? meh, I'll probably end up going by myself. Rize looks good too. Land of the Dead looks dumb. Zombies never work people. Sorry, they just don't!

I'M GOING BACK TO SUNNYSIDE!!!!! I'M GOING BACK TO SUNNYSIDE!!!!! but I'm kinda sad 'cause Willis isn't gonna be there. neither are Jason, Dave, Carmen, or Paula. Well you guys suck. At least Jerry and Rachel will still be there. And then a bunch of newbies. Er, lets see... Ephie, Biyo, Shrenik, Jenn W.

Hmm, i feel like ranting today... Hey, it's only been a week of summer! Wee. Oh, I found these funny comedian quotes in different issues of Time Magazine:

""President Bush met with the President of South Korea. Things got off to an awkward start when President Bush asked, 'Are you from the good Korea or the bad Korea?'""- Conan O'Brien

""This ist he time of year when all of the networks announce their new fall programming. CBS has a tremendous reality show, and it's a combination of The bachelor and also Survivor. It's call ""Who Wants to Marry Robert Blake?""- David Letterman

""There's a rumor that Dick Cheny may run for President in 2008. If he wins, that would make him the first three-term president since Roosevelt.""- Jay Leno

""What a crazy week in Hollywood- Michael Jackson has stopped sleeping with children in his bed and Tom Cruise has started."" - Michael Somerville(Just in case those of you who don't really get this one, Tom Cruise recently got engaged to Katie Holmes who is about 17 years his junior)

And my favorite:

""Three and a half years ago, Congress passed the Patriot Act, a sweeping counterterrorism measure carefully crafted to be just restrictive enough to impinge on civil liberties without actually being effective.""- Jon Stewart

Am I done?

Not yet.

You guys should all try MOTAS (http://www.albartus.com/motas/) it's hella fun and addictive. I found it a long time ago, during the school year so I never had time to play it but it is addicting now that it's summer. Basically, you are locked in a building. You don't know who you are. and you are making your way through the building and learning a bit about yourself along the way. Really challenging gotta use your head a lot and click a lotta things. (hint: In one room, you have to get out using just a poster and a screw)

HHHHHOOOOOOOWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAAY

You know what? I used to think the Howie Day was a band. It's a kinda funny name for a person.

Oh yeah, update on the concert. It's at the Fillmore and Anna Nalick will be opening for him. She's pretty good. I like her song Breathe alot but the music video's kinda dumb. Go on www.musicvideos.com and search for Anna Nalick.

Am I done? Nope. Now I'm going to predict the good, bad and the ""interesting"" (i cannot determine or am ambivalent) movies of this summer:

Bad:

Fantastic Four (sorry, I was a fantastic four fan when i was little too, but the trailers looks really bad, especially the special effects)

Rebound

The Dukes of Hazzard

Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo

Skeleton Key

The Cave

Land of the Dead

Undead (as you can see, I'm not a fan of zombies)

Herbie: fully loaded

The Perfect Man (has Hillary Duff ever been in a good movie?)

"event","Movie: Mr. and Mrs. Smith

Director: Doug Liman (er, i know i spelled it wrong)

Review: People are going to kill me for this review and since people already do... then who cares? I LIKED THIS MOVIE. sorry everyone else. THIS MOVIE IS FOR FUN. THE PLOT IS ILLOGICAL BUT IT WORKS. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt look really good together and they act so well with each other. The idea is ridiculous but beyond that, everything is rational. THE CHASE SCENE IS REALLY GOOD.

short review, cuz i gotta go sorry

bottom line: been waiting for a good action movie with just the right amount of humor? then Mr. and Mrs. Smith is for you."

Strange reactions i got from people for my day of silence:

Jason: Can I get one of those cards for Creager?

James: So, that means that i can say ANYTHING i want to you and you cant respond?

Ryan: You're my hero (creepy hug)

Jennifer Y: So does that mean you have to be silent the WHOLE  day? (isn't that what the card said?) Or is it the WHOLE week?

"event","Following up on my serious, serious Ralph Fiennes obsession (i finally found out how to pronounce his name correctly: Rayfe Fines) I was so happy when i found <i>Quiz Show</i> in the library. So, being that i haven't reviewed a movie in a long time, here it is:

Movie: <i>Quiz Show</i>

Director: Robert Redford (<i>Ordinary People</i>)

Stars: John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow

Review: This movie is fascinating if you like stuff from the late fifties, early sixties. It is about the controversy that surrounded the extremely popular game show, Twenty One in the early sixties. I haven't really researched the actual scandal, but according to the movie, the producers fed the contestants answers and when the ratings dropped, they got the current champion to pretend to lose so that they could get a ""fresh"" (usually better looking) champion. Tuturro plays Herbie Stempel, a smart, nerdy guy who just keeps winning and winning and winning. But the producers ""fire"" him for the wealthy, upperclass, famous, VERY VERY goodlooking :D Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes). The most interesting part of this movie is not so much the actual game show problems, it's the contestants motivations to play. Stempel is made off by the public as a guy who wants nothing but money because he isn't rich (lives in the dumps of NY), is Jewish, and is kinda ugly. In the beginning, even I as a viewer was fooled by Van Doren's kind demeanor and his concern that his playing on the show was from dishonest procedures. All he wanted to do was allow children to see that learning is fun. But then, his intentions become muddled as the money begins to come in and he realizes that the better he does in the show, the prouder his father is of him.

There is a underlining message about racism that is subtly placed in and i feel that if they had played that up a bit, it would have been even better. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. and if you don't want to watch it for the movie plot, then watch it for Ralph Fiennes!!! Sorry boys, not much in it for you if you're not interested in the story (unless you're gay. then you TOTALLY lucked out!!:D)

Note: Ralph Fiennes can do just about every accent except american. it is so freakin' shitty!

Note Note: His voice is kinda nasaly too, but still hot!!"

"event","What does my birthday mean?
apparently:
Your Birthdate: July 29 
Your birthday on the 29th adds a tone of idealism to your nature. 
You are imaginative and creative, but rather uncomfortable in the business world. 
You are very aware and sensitive, with outstanding intuitive skills and analytical abilities. 

The 29 reduces to 11, one of the master numbers which often produces much nervous tension. 
This is the birthday of the dreamer rather than the doer. 
You do, however, work very well with people. 

How does 29 reduce to 11? Or are they just implying i'm stupid?"

"event","Wow, it's been a while, huh?

Well, here's my useless entry for the month:

I have recently taken a sort of fanaticism to Ralph Fiennes. For all you Harry Potter fans, you already know that he will be playing THE Lord Voldemort in the upcoming GoF film. Here's his villain record:

Schindler's List (1993)- psychopathic Nazi commandant, Amon Goethe

Red Dragon (2002)- crazed, lunatic, misunderstood serial killer, Francis ""The Tooth Fairy"" Dolarhyde

And after two Academy Award and several Golden Globe nominations, several BAFTA (british version of the oscars) wins, perhaps his most evil villain of all...

Jennifer Lopez's love interest in Maid in Manhattan (2002)...

BARF

Sigh, oh well, Ralph Fiennes is still gorgeous and he has quite a resume. So, I don't doubt that he will make a fabulous Lord Voldemort. I just hope he doesn't tie himself down to HP for the next like six years.

"event","A great song from a great band. Too bad LJ doesn't have bg music. go to my xanga if you wanna listen:

""The World I Know""- Collective Soul

Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all the kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on.
I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why.

Are we listening
To hymns of offering?
Have we eyes to see
That love is gathering?
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one.

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below.
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down.
'Cause it's the world I know.
It's the world I know.

There's an awesome x/1999 fanmade music video that goes with this song. it's really good. go on google and type in ""music videos by nausicaa"""

I was so excited about the concept of Anthony and me moving up to JVA that i just blurted out that we wanted to without thinking. Now that i have thought about it, I (speaking for myself) don't even think I deserve to be on JVA. I mean, we won ONE challenge and they quit already. *smacks head against table* Now I want to delete the reply, but I don't want to pass up the opportunity. Need help, dammit!


On a happier note, driver's ed is boring as hell. HA! Ryan, IN YOUR FACE!!!!!!

<P>There are two objects heading towards each other. You are watching them. When they crash, things break. Do you look away? Most likely not. Why? Because, as terrible as it is, you want to see what happens next.</P>
<P>And thus i come to my point. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (the movie) is that crash I can't look away from. I have my hands over my eyes, and every once in&nbsp;a while I take a glance and regret doing so right after. I could have died happy knowing that they only made three Harry Potter movies. But noooooo, they just keep chugging along. I DESPISE IT. I DESPISE THE FACT THAT DAVID HEYMAN KEEPS THINKING THAT DAN, RUPERT, EMMA, TOM, ETC. WILL MIRACULOUSLY STOP AGING. I DESPISE THE FACT THAT THE COSTUME AND SET&nbsp;DESIGNERS AND STEVE KLOVES ARE SUCKING ALL THE <EM><U>MAGIC</U></EM> OUT OF A <EM><U>MAGIC</U></EM> SCHOOL. </P>
<P>FOR GOODNESS SAKES, EMMA IS NEARLY FIFTEEN, DAN IS NEARLY SIXTEEN, RUPERT IS ALREADY SEVENTEEN, AND TOM IS TURNING EIGHTEEN. WHY THE HELL ARE THEY PLAYING FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS???</P>

"event","Nearly Headless Nick
In the first draft of 'Chamber of Secrets', Nick sang a self-penned ballad explaining how his head had (nearly) come off. My editor was not very fond of the song and so I cut it. However, for those who are curious, here is the story of Nick's decapitation in his own moving words.- JK Rowling

It was a mistake any wizard could make
Who was tired and caught on the hop
One piffling error, and then, to my terror,
I found myself facing the chop.
Alas for the eve when I met Lady Grieve
A-strolling the park in the dusk!
She was of the belief I could straighten her teeth
Next moment she'd sprouted a tusk.
I cried through the night that I'd soon put her right
But the process of justice was lax;
They'd brought out the block, though they'd mislaid the rock
Where they usually sharpened the axe.
Next morning at dawn, with a face most forlorn,
The priest said to try not to cry,
""You can come just like that, no, you won't need a hat,""
And I knew that my end must be nigh.
The man in the mask who would have the sad task
Of cleaving my head from my neck,
Said ""Nick, if you please, will you get to your knees,""
And I turned to a gibbering wreck.
""This may sting a bit"" said the cack-handed twit
As he swung the axe up in the air,
But oh the blunt blade! No difference it made,
My head was still definitely there.
The axeman he hacked and he whacked and he thwacked,
""Won't be too long"", he assured me,
But quick it was not, and the bone-headed clot
Took forty-five goes 'til he floored me.
And so I was dead, but my faithful old head
It never saw fit to desert me,
It still lingers on, that's the end of my song,
And now, please applaud, or you'll hurt me."

Who wants to help this poor html, css illiterate child start up a movie review site? More than half the credit will go to you. Leave a comment if interested.

In other other news:
I was flipping through my old ""writings"" folder and found some old stuff i was writing in like seventh grade and stuff. Good ideas, really pathetic grammar and description. I'm proud to say I have advanced forward. But I digress. I looked at my ""Maistre of Vampires"" story that i was really into writing last year (got like 35 pages worth of text). Then i stopped, tried to start but couldn't. Serious case of writer's block. Who wants to help out? Basic, ""i don't give a shit"" summary:
girl hates world
girl wants to become a vampire
girl meets vampire
girl becomes vampire
vampire and girl fall in love
girl doesn't know that vampire loves her for a different reason
girl finds out
girl abandons vampire
vampire's ""brother"" (also a vampire) finds girl desolate
vampire bro and girl fall in love (like real love)
(insert a bunch of mythology and history, etc.)
girl finds out that she hates both vampires and runs away and wants to die, but cant cuz she's immortal

Er, i don't think the story is as pathetic as it sounds. I think (and I might be biased here) it's pretty good, just rough around the edges. But i really don't know what to do with the girl now. I don't really wanna kill her off, cause i have a special ending in mind. and i REALLY DON'T WANT HER TO RE-FALL IN LOVE WITH EITHER OF THE VAMPIRES. and if you, reader are still reading this, you must be really bored. So I'll stop.

"event","lol, I'm doing an interactive poll. here's the scenario:

Today, we were watching a badminton video during practice in the mat room. Obviously, no one was paying attention. So, ephie, jeffrey, me and rachelle were sitting in a row in the corner (in that order). They had turned off the lights so it was pretty dark except for the light coming from the TV. I reach down to scratch my leg and look up and Rachelle is giving me this ""wtf"" look. So i said, ""What?"" and there was a pause. Then suddenly, i guess something clicked in her mind and she was like ""Oh! See, I thought jeffrey had reached over and was scratching your leg."" Now, keep in mind this entire time, Rachelle knew full well that jeffrey had both his arms around ephie.

lol now here'e the interactive part:

If you think Rachelle is dumb, post this entire entry in your xanga/livejournal. Seriously, she wants to see the results. Sad isn't it?"

First to my AP Biology group: Daniel, Ryan, and Jerry. I hope to get better by the weekend, but if not, please practice without me. Just 'cause I'm sick doesn't mean I should hold you back. I'll email the presentation to you guys. Edit it, PLEASE!!!

Second to Daniel as an individual. I'm crossing my fingers, praying that I'll be well enough to go to school tomorrow, but in any case, Suratos wouldn't mark you off and you don't really need my half to demonstrate your half.

Well, going to go surf the net. 11:50. I should be in AP Bio right now."

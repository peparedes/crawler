"event","&nbsp;<div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week we came back from winter vacation and I started my new placement with Mrs. S.&nbsp;I am now with a first grade classroom, which is much different from my sixth graders.&nbsp;I am excited about my new placement and hope that it will work out well.&nbsp;There are only twenty students in the classroom, which is much different from the thirty-two students I was used to in Mr. C's room.&nbsp;Of these twenty students, there are a handful that seem very rambunctious!&nbsp;I have observed and substitute taught other first grade classrooms that were much more organized and had only one or two active students.&nbsp;I am sure I will find challenges when teaching this group of students, compared to my sixth graders.&nbsp;Next week will be my first week of teaching lessons, which will be fun.&nbsp;I am looking forward to the next few months with this classroom.&nbsp;</div><div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended the grade level meeting for the first grade team on Friday.&nbsp;For the first portion of the meeting, they were going over a math portfolio project that was not pertinent to us; Mrs. F advised me she would let me know when they were done with that portion, so I could join them.&nbsp;During this time, I helped&nbsp;Mrs. L &nbsp;with some of the classroom projects she was working on.&nbsp;I also browsed Mrs. F's classroom, in which I realized how organized she was.&nbsp;She has a great classroom, with so much to look at and for the students to interact with, I was really impressed with her classroom.&nbsp;Once the teachers were done with their math project, the student teachers joined the meeting.&nbsp;We discussed ELO classes after school.&nbsp;I expressed being interested in teaching an ELO class.&nbsp;Miss S and one of the other first grade teachers will also be teaching ELO classes.&nbsp;I will be teaching fluency on Tuesday and Wednesday, which I am looking forward to.&nbsp;I just hope that it does not interfere with my planning time with Mrs. S&nbsp;as she explained that she does not stay very late or get to school very early.&nbsp;The two days I will be teaching ELO are my student teaching days and my other student teaching day, is Friday, which is when we have grade level and Mrs. S &nbsp;leaves early for a standing doctor's appointment.&nbsp;I am sure we will be able to make time to plan somewhere and Monette seems very excited about helping me.&nbsp;</div><div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as my two new focus students, I have decided to observe Martin for my behavior student.&nbsp;Within five minutes in the classroom, you will know which student is Martin.&nbsp;He is very active but also a very bright student.&nbsp;As much as he drives you crazy, you cannot help but love him!!!&nbsp;It will be very interesting to write about Martin every week.&nbsp;As far as my other focus student, I changed my mind from my initial pick and I will be observing Alexis.&nbsp;When entering some test scores from Friday I noticed that she had some low grades in both math and language arts.&nbsp;I have also noticed that she has a little trouble paying attention in class sometimes.&nbsp;When doing my very informal focused observation and learning/interest survey I learned that Alexis was in some sort of accident when she was little and her mother tried to explain to Mrs. S her medical issues, but her mother had difficulty explaining.&nbsp;Mrs. S explained that she may have a blood clot and her mother said she gets terrible headaches because of this.&nbsp;Mrs. S did note her starring off into space during class, which I had already noticed.&nbsp;I think Alexis will be a perfect focus student to observe.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>"

"event","&nbsp;<div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=""3"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week we did not have grade level meetings, as teachers are to be working on their grades.&nbsp;Next week we have parent teacher conferences.&nbsp;There are only a few students in the class that have a primary language of English, therefore only a handful of conferences that I could choose from to attend.&nbsp;Luckily, on Thursday morning before seminar there are two conferences that will be in English, so I will attend those two meetings.&nbsp;It will be interesting to see Mr. Castro's interaction with the parents one on one.&nbsp;The first conference I will be attending is for Amy, one of my focus students.&nbsp;It will be interesting to observe this conference as she is having difficulties academically and behaviorally.&nbsp;One the other hand the next conference I will be present for is with Martin parents, which he is the opposite.&nbsp;Martin is well behaved and does very well academically.&nbsp;I am glad that I will be able to see Mr. Castro's interaction with the parents of two different types of students.&nbsp;</font></div><div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><font size=""3"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was interesting to see how many of the teachers were scrambling to get their grades ready.&nbsp;Even some of the more organized teachers seemed to have very little done.&nbsp;It made me realize that no matter how organized I am, I may be doing this myself next year.&nbsp;I did stay and help Mr. Castro with some recording of grades and I was able to see how he did his grades.&nbsp;It is always good to see how different people do things as it will me give me ideas for next year.&nbsp;This is something I will also be able to observe my next master teacher do, which will give me another perspective.&nbsp;As much as I love Mr. Castro's classroom I am looking forward to moving to a primary grade with a new teacher.&nbsp;I feel another perspective on certain aspects will be very beneficial.&nbsp;I am also looking forward to the younger students with less attitudes.&nbsp;Of course, with anything, there is give and take and having the younger students with less attitude also means they will require more assistance with everything!</font></div>"

"event","&nbsp;<div style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">This week was another interesting week of subbing all three of my student teaching days!&nbsp;I am also subbing this coming Monday and Tuesday. &nbsp;In this month, I will have subbed a total of eight days for my master teacher.&nbsp;I am enjoying the time alone with my students, and also developing my classroom management skills.&nbsp;Much like I saw last week, the students behave much differently with me than Mr. Castro.&nbsp;I am using this time to work on classroom management skills, but still feeling that it will be very different once I have my own classroom.&nbsp;Now thinking about it, I am happy to have started out with sixth graders, because I figure if I can control them, once I move to primary it will be easy.&nbsp;At least this is what I am hoping!!!&nbsp;I am looking forward to my days of subbing next week. </div>"

"event","&nbsp;<span style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">Well, this was a tough week for me- I was sick, my husband was gone, first week of lesson plans, and first week of school at UCR.&nbsp;I survived this week, even after getting a nail in my tire after seminar on Thursday.&nbsp; I'm sure there will be many more weeks like this to come in the next few months.&nbsp;Now that we have begun writing our lesson plans, I have learned a couple things.&nbsp;First, do not always trust the book on giving good examples for the students.&nbsp;On both of my math lessons, I used the Houghton Mifflin example from the book and the students looked at me with much confusion.&nbsp;I had to come up with a different way to explain it to them.&nbsp;So, I learned not to rely on the teacher's manual to provide the best example and always try to have a back-up plan.&nbsp;Next, I learned that I actually do much better teaching on the spot without a lesson plan.&nbsp;Each time I taught my lesson that I thoroughly planned out and wrote, I got nervous and something always went wrong.&nbsp;Even, Mr. Castro noted that I need to become more relaxed when in front of the students, like when I teach on the spot lesson.&nbsp;I think the idea of a lesson plan being so formal and knowing he is watching me and taking notes makes me nervous.&nbsp; I will have to come up with some way of becoming more relaxed.&nbsp;</span>"

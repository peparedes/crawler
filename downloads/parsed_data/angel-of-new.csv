The gf and I broke up,she wouldnt let me leave her house, i almost broke her arm moving her, I pushed my thumb into her throat, i finnally got out, she tyook my boots, socks, workclothes, hat, sunnies, amokes and the shirt i was wearing away from me, so i threw her to the ground as she tried to take my house keys, I walk down the street, she follows and king hits me from behind, i kick her in the leg, spit on her and call her a slut, I have a sore jaw and blistered feet, she stole my email and livejournal accounts on the basis she had all the passwords, and this is where I am the lord and master. WHEN YOU STEAL AN EMAIL SKANK, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE SECRET QUESTION AS WELL. I've been stealin since been stealin since been stealin. Dont fuck with me, you only end up worse off

Taken up a interest in learning to play the piano, failing to have the ability, space or finance to actually own a piano, i am investing in a keyboard. Little brother sean has finnaly taken his interest in electronic music a little further than just banging down pingers and going out on weekends, he is trying to get a set of cd scratchers and a mixing deck, which as always ebay has found for him at a nice low price. How does all this come together, well if we both get a just a little good, we can make our own music, like we used to do with spoons and mums saucepans (that lovely sleep depriving sound)

Tis all, hope you all had a great day, and pete, dont worry about the windows, send it over to windscreens obrian, they should be open 2moro i think they were telling us."

A guy in a new XR6 ute managed to write off two of my mates cars and his brothers and do considerable damage to a landcruiser parked up the street, oh by the way... the four cars were PARKED and one of his cars was only 10 hours old...  $50 000 worth of damage and the idiot still tried to drive away, the only thing that stopped him was his wheels were bent under the car and the motor wouldnt start because it would have been so displaced that nothing was hooked up.

"event","How to start this.. meh like this i spose

So some people like to tinker with things? yes? Some people like to say, try renovate their houses, some people try to fix their plumbing. Some people try to fix cars, alot fail.

Today I managed to install a boost gauge in my car, no great feat right? Well, I think it is, all things considered my car is 3 years old, still under warranty and so far owes me $45000. And here I am pulling it apart, modifying it, and worst of all, doing it myself. I so far have managed to change the clutch, change teh suspension, intall my boost gauge, both the vacuum set up and 2moro I will wire in the lighting for it. Next up I have a electric oil tempratue gauge and oil pressure gauge to install, which has to run through the dash of the car, hmm fun getting in there, but watch me do it, and why? why dont I just pay the $100 to install it? Because I'm poor and I would rather learn it myself.

Next step is to by a flash tuning unit, which is a trick peice of gear that lets me tune the cars motor in every aspect, from when the knock sensor stops the motor working, to simple fuel air ratio's. Now to tune this I need a laptop, too easy, ebay is great for cheap crap. Why would I want to try tune my own car when I can pay some1 to pull their own hair out for hours trying to get that extra half a kw of power? Because I like to learn, and I would rather be able to toy with it myself. 

At the moment I'm a 2nd year apprentice panel beater, I am starting to get really good at what I'm doing, its great, yet next year I want to start an external uni degree in one of three things. Psychology (always been a passion) councelling (same sort of thing, still helping people) or a business degree. I know its going to be hard, but hell its something I would love on my resume when I go for any new jobs. I figure by the time I have finished my degree I will well and truely be a good panel beater and be able to leave my trade and go do a little work as a psychologist/councellor. After a few years of that and learning how it all works I would love to go do an adult apprentiship as a mechanic, how I love tinkering with the mechanical side of cars.

So thats the change in life I am becoming so very keen about undertaking.

Lets just see how I go

Cars will forever rock my socks, untill I lose interest"

- Staying up till 5 am with nothing to do the next day
- staying up till 5 am with tafe in 3 hours
- that feeling of paranoia I used to always have
- writing poems for hours on ends
- the feeling of deep empathy
- the feeling of deep apathy
- training in a martial art just to keep myself focused on something, even if it was for 9 hour stints
- waking up at 4 pm
- driving in a car with no roof
- having to walk everywhere (I'm going to find this one again as I cant drive anymore)
- chasing chicks around trying to get some
- that feeling of nervousness and discomfort around a new girlfriend
- listening to new music
- having political discussions with others that dont share my veiw
- using my hands to write and not work
- never watching television on the basis it is unproductive
- running at night
- running at anytime!
- going to the gym (start again tommorow, yay!)
- wondering about things far beyond my comprehension for hours, days and weeks on end, just to come to no conclusion
- reading books, full in detail non fiction books
- destroying the bones in my shins for the sake of having some fun with my brother.


This settled life, this working life, it suits my expencive car habits, but it denies me of what I love. Maybe work for a few more years, make my mark, learn my trade, then start study again. Give up work and go try my hand at uni once again. All the while driving my beloved car.. which by the way, now has 7 thousand dollars of modifications done, (all thats changed is the suspension, clutch and gear selection lever..) ahh this car is going to be the end of me I swear"

and a hero no one else could save, it was never much but it's all that you gave.

And I wonder if you wonder, or did your stars finally explode?
Did the thunder pull you underneath the haze?
I'm amazed, then I let go. 

Little minds let little pain burn big old dreams with little flames,
and you don't think I understand.
Little holes in parachutes won't leave you falling,
if they do, it's because you want to land. 

Climbing out of his chair to fix the T.V. glare is a man
but no one knows he's there.
It's a Dramamine dream that kept them alive but lost.
She's got her plastic friends and a brand new Benz and she laughs,
""Hell, sometimes life ain't fair""
It's a comic book crush that got them nowhere. 

These elevator doors are closing again you leave before I planned.
I taste you walking down the hall.
You left your perfume on the nightstand.




I've figured out i'm old now.. I dont listen to angry music anymore, I hardly listen to my techno either, I've setlled, and I dont know why I am so jadded, but I am. Its not bad, just interesting"

I'm almost overwhealmed with excitement because I am getting a new car

I'm overcome by the fact I'm in love

I'm sad because I'm coming down

I'm happy because nothing matters right now, not a fucking thing

I've lost 11 kg in 4 months

Car broke last night, ran out of water because I didnt put the radiator cap back on properly, it wouldnt start again, but all is good, it died before it caused any damage. 

soooo, I am over the idea of a GTR, I can afford the car, but I cant afford the parts and mechanical. In its place I am buying a XR6 Turbo, hehehe easy to get parts, easy to modify, goes fast enough to drift, yaaaaaaay new car!@"

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

Damn it, see this is whats wrong with our world, we place too much importance on human life rather than on the survival of our entire species. All i'm going to say is, the pope is old, get over the fact he will die and instead of crying over the loss of one man who WILL be replaced, go out and donate some money to charity, go out and take a homeless person into your home and get them a job, save them. Do anything, but give your time and emotion to a man you do not know... 

GAH my opinions confound people, but if you ask enough questions, I will let you see that all my opinions are justified, but know that in saying this, you will be very frightened by the fact I am right....."

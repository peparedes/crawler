"event","<p>so i've been grounded for the last month i think haha well igot ungrounded on wedsnday..but whatever uhmmm anyways me and ryan spent our one year together it was really amazing and im glad he's up here, but he's leaving friday...urgh he's going to talk to hunters dad about letting him move in with them seeing as they have a free bedroom. uhmm actually the other day kristy caitlin ryan hunter and myself went swimming and ryan was mad at for..uhm actually i forget but he was mad at me&nbsp; and we almost broke up, the day after that i went to his house and we made up or whatever and he said he was really sorry for evening considering the idea and he just loves me so much, lately though we've had some of the worst conversations, we've actually talked about what we think would happen if we ever broke up. i think if we did it'd still kinda be the same because he said he'd still call me and say he loved me because nothing could ever change that. i dont know it's just awkward when we talk about stuff like that i mean honestly i dont know what i'd ever do if we did break up, caitlin told me she'd be at my house everyday and every night because i need a shoulder to cry on because ofcourse i'd be balling my eyes out forever. but yeah i asked ryan if we were to break if he'd still go to my senior prom with me and hes like ""well yeah i promised didn't i?"" and i was like yeah..but what if things change and you have a new girlfriend or something, and he's like ""babe, if i promised it, you know it's going to happen, nothing would make me happier than to see you happy..and i don't think i would ever have another girlfriend after you."" and i was just in awe, i love when he talks to me like that it just makes my day.<br /><br />so i got my senior pictures done and a few of them had ryan in them and 5 had my sister in them. i hope they come out good. i can't wait to see them, but i gotta get going. i'll try and get on as much as i can and keep whoever reads these things updated on how my life has been going.</p>"

"event","finally im a senior...it's so crazy how fast time really goes by. i wish it would honestly slow down. i remember all the times i always wished i was a senior, now im kinda scared. it's going to be so hard to leave everyone i've met&nbsp; at keene, im sure i'll see them around but i dont know its going to be hard watching all my friends walk across the stage and get our diploma's, espically seeing my really close friendsgraduate and become the best people they can be..i remember freshmen year me and sam connor always talked about graduation, we had always been pumped about it;; i guess it's kind of a natural thing to be excited to get out into the world, to tell you the truth, im really scared. im going to be making my own dinner soon lol, living on my own with really no one to rely on but myself, yeah i know my moms always going to be there for me but it's really time for me to grow up and become an adult... and live my life how i really want to live it.
urgh i hope this summer is one of the bests because it's really going to be like my last one. after i graduate i hope i get a decent job and i'll probably take a year off before going to college or whatever lies ahead of me, i just hope i can handle it.

so i just want to put in here that my friends mean the absolute world to me and without them i'd probably be nothing, actually i would be nothing. i'd die without my best friend cody obrien, he's always been such a caring and very loving person and im so glad i met him, brittany shanahan, 16 years and still strong, nothing could and will not ever come between us too, im an aunt now thanks to her [sophia marie&lt;3 i'm going to be such a large part of her life..] holly rhodes, amazing times with this girl, i really love her and miss her, i wish she didnt drop out. its not the same, erin dreleau since day one we've been the best of friends, i love her. catie anne, i'd be lost without her, she always knows how to put a smile on my face and i love her so much for that, samantha connor, although we've drifted i want you to kno im always going to be here for you, and you know i'll never be one of those friends that says that and doesn't back it up. i've missed you and i hope we get back to how we use to be someday, your amazing, joey rice, an incredible and amazing person, he's taught me so much and he hasnt even realized it..he'll always have a special place in my heart, and last but certainly not least. ryan michael donohue he's truely and completely my best friend and im so so so thankful to have met him, he makes my days so much better and he's the reason i even put up with anything, i just love him. i love all my friends and they just all mean so much to me and have changed my life even in the simpliest ways that they probably havent realized any of it, but im thankful for having them by&nbsp; my side.

forever and a day&lt;3"

"event","<p><strong>okay so my last little entry thing was kinda lame because yeah it just was, but okay since basically last july my entire life has changed for the better. although im not friends with the people i was friends with, im glad i've got the ones i do have now. since july 7th of last year i've been going out with one of the most amazing people in the world, Ryan donohue, and for sure he means everything to me, im not like most girls who say that and then like ditch their friends to call or hang out with my boyfriend, obviously i cant, he live in Florida. yeah i get that we live far away and most people think its never going to last or whatever but yeah it has now for 11 months. im happy with him. a lots changed since freshmen year too.&nbsp; i dont talk to a lot of the people i thought i was always going to be friends with, we all went our seperate ways i guess, not all of us though i still talk to Erin Dreleau who has been one of my closest friends since the fifth grade, i dont really talk to Sam that much anymore which is deffinatly a down fall on my part, we just kinda stopped talking after volley... i use to ignore heather all the time but now we've gotten a lot closer and to my dismay shes preganant, i mean im not really upset but im not really happy either...uhm does that make sence? i just wish she had thought about what she was doing ya know, but whatever its her life, my best friend cody obrien is amazing and im so thankful to have met him, we're basically opposites but we get along like peanut butter and jelly =]<br /><br />i've really grown over the past few years and the people that have known me forever could probably tell, im not as up tight as i was before, im so much more laid back, im not as snobby as i once was, i get along with a variety of different people, i tell people what i really think of them, if i dont like them their going to know, i dont lie to my parents at all anymore, sometimes i just dont tell them the whole truth though, im alot more open to people than i was before, yeah i dont like talking about my feelings but if im close to you then im going to. when i was younger i use to care about what i looked like, if people liked me, how i acted in public, how i acted around certain people, im deffinatly not like that at all anymore...im not here to impress anyone but myself...i dont have to be someone im not just so someone will like me, of course i love having a lot of friends but if i have to be something im not then i'll probably never talk to your shallow ass again, im over the highschool drama, lifes to short to worry about stupid shit.<br /><br />okay so yeah thats just a lot about how i am now. i think...i might have rambled alot haha but oh well...<br />im looking foward to my senior year at keene high, i've met some amazing people there and they've all changed my life in so many ways. i still dont know if im going to college yet, i'd like to but i dont know really if its for me, i might just go to like a tech school or something and become something important like a secartary or something.. haha could you see me being organized lol and in a skirt? haha not me but i do need a good paying job and thats one of them also im looking into being a massage therapist, i mean although i may need to touch some fat nasty mans hairy pimply back i dont care, its going to get me some cash..me and ryan have been talking about staying together for as long as possible is it bad or weird that i think i've already found the person im going to be spending the rest of my life with? im hoping to move out of my parents place and live somewhere nice possibly an apartment [obviously] with ryan...he doesnt know when he's moving up here yet, but im thinking soon it should happen. i think i should just move down there but he wants to live in the 'shire....i dont know but yeah thats basically it, i really dont know what else to write and plus i gotta go clean my disaster room and do laundry, amanda's moving out so i might have her room....i dont know though.</strong></p>"

""what do u do when the person who dries your tears was the one who made you cry"" i miss him like so much and i think he might have blocked me on aim but idk..i hope not that would suck...it seems like my friend doesnt even care...im soo glad that i have britt because like right now shes the only one i can talk to about wats goin on in my life because when i try to talk to someone i trusted really well in skool she goes and tells people about it and it just really bites! but yea i really dont kno wat to write and i dont want to write any more ne ways so later

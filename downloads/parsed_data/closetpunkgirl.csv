"event","Actually, they don't, but ""all my exes live in Texas, except for two of them""  doesn't quite have the same ring.

The Dreaded Ex called last night.  Why does he do that?  I am over him; I regard him with something that best resembles apathy; I harbor no bitterness toward him anymore.  I'm with Nick now, who is wonderful and crazy about me.  Why must he call and try to stir up trouble?  Being drunk and horny is no excuse.  Not only does he no longer inspire that kind of attention from me, but, even if he did, it would be pretty difficult to mount me from Connecticut.  And I'm sure that Nick would have something to say about it as well.

One thing that the ex does still inspire in me is reflection, so I'm just going to write it all out and thus purge myself of any more thoughts on the subject this evening.  I have no concept of what constitutes TMI, so if you run onto something that you didn't need to know, my apologies.

I haven't dated much.  I am not one of those people who jump from boyfriend to boyfriend on a regular basis.  I've only had 4-5 (the jury's still out on which is true - more on that later) exclusive prior relationships.  The rest of the guys in my life have just been friends (sans benefits), and that works best for me and for them.  I'm a much better friend than partner.

It all started with David.  I met David the day before my fifteenth birthday.  He was a freshman in college at the time, and that's very exciting for a 15-year-old.  We met at the mall.  I was actually with my parents but had wandered off to the food court to get a drink, and there he was.  David is a very attractive man - you can't miss him - and, at the time, I was skinny and cute and hard to miss (especially for a 19-year-old guy) as well.  So we met.  And we kept the relationship very private, for the most part.  The parents would not have approved, and scandal of any kind in a small town would have been bad for Daddy politically, so we were very careful to be discreet. We kept in touch but didn't officially start dating until the summer after my senior year.  David was my first - it wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it was just nice (name that musical).  We got along on a personal level, but the connection was mostly physical.  We broke up because he slept with someone else and I reasoned that, by definition, that meant that we were no longer exclusive.  I wasn't mad; that's just the way things go.  I think it still disturbs him a little that I broke up with him with so little emotion, but what can I say?  It wasn't an emotional connection.  We backtracked to friendship spring of my freshman year of college.

This is where the numbers discrepancy rears its ugly head.  Apparently, I then started dating my friend Ryan.  Unfortunately, he forgot to inform me that we were dating, so I never knew until we ""broke up.""  There was no physical involvement here.  He kissed me twice, and they were more like grandma kisses than boyfriend kisses.  I only recall one conversation that might have led him to believe that we were more than friends.  One evening, when we were watching Monty Python, he turned to me and breathed (he had a very breathy voice that I always found wildly amusing), ""People think we're dating, you know.  We've never talked about it.""  And I laughed - not *giggle giggle* he's-so-cute laughter, but ha-ha-what-a-humorous-yet-appalling-idea laughter.  What I took from that conversation was that we were just friends and that people are gullible; what he took from that conversation was that I wanted him big time.  I never really believed that others thought we were dating until he started dating my friend Sheri and everyone treated me like the jilted lover.  I was only too happy to erase their concerns that I was pining away for him in my dorm room.  He still counts me as an ex, but I'm not so sure.

By this time, I was experimenting (you know how it goes).  I had put on the proverbial freshman 15, which I was determined to lose by any means necessary, but my resolve seriously clashed with my affinity for drinking games, so I learned to compensate.  Public service announcement - failure to eat and sleep, especially when accompanied by a regular speed habit, while effective, is not a healthy way to lose weight.  But enter Felix, who was more than willing to be a supplier for his poor but talented girlfriend, and all common knowledge goes out the window.  I made really good grades that year, though.  Felix also hooked me up with his friend who got me enough singing gigs (drunk people are not musically picky) to ensure that I did not have to live on the street.  Felix was very useful, but still no emotional connection.

Fast-forward to Blake (the one who called).  He was exactly the opposite.  I had no initial attraction to him, but he liked to argue, and so do I, so we had great conversations.  As an added plus, he made me laugh, so there was an extraordinary emotional connection.  We should have remained friends, and all would have been fine.  But, as emotional connection often leads to delusions of physical attraction, the inevitable ""who exactly are we to each other?"" conversation ensued.  To make an incredibly long, painful story short, our problem was that we never really answered that question, but we acted as if we did.  He got jealous if I looked at anyone else, but threw our indecision in my face when he decided that he wanted to take up with Kaci. 

Now, every time that they have a fight, he drinks heavily and calls me for sympathy.  I just don't care enough to offer it.  I do wonder, however, if she knows how long he was dating both of us at the same time?  Maybe I should give Kaci a call. *grows horns; grabs pitchfork*

Two years post-Blake, I dated Matt.  We went to grad school together, so we had a lot in common.  Our timing was great - we were both tired of nursing wounds and were looking for something easy-going and fun, and that's what we had.  It was nice.

*breathes sigh of relief*  A weight has been lifted.  Thanks for letting me reflect.  I mean, you really didn't have a choice, but thanks all the same."

"event","I have a question.  Take a deep breath, then proceed.

What is it with this Michael Rosenbaum person?  I read a lot about him and Smallville in some of your journals, and I may be daft, but I just don't get it.  I mean, he's attractive enough - I'd let him buy me a drink - but what's so special about him?  I could understand if it was about that Superman Boy, because, holy catfish, he's pretty!  But Lex?  I'm skeptical.

I guess I'm just interested in (how shall I put this?) more obvious attractiveness.  Take Brad Pitt, for example.  Now there is a hot man, and it's not really a matter of opinion.  He is, by definition, a hot, hot man.  I know that tastes vary and all that different-strokes-for-different-folks business, but if anyone could look at Brad Pitt and not think that he's attractive (even if they are not attracted to him personally) - I'm sorry; their taste is wrong.  Just wrong.

So what is it?  Defend your obsession.  I'm going to watch Smallville tonight - it looks like a good one, and I don't think I'm allowed to miss it even if I wanted to - and I'd like to know what's so great about the bald one."

"event","Well, I suppose I should introduce myself.  I usually make my students tell me their names and their three M's (favorite music, movie and meal) on the first day of class, so that's how I'll start here.

Hello.  My name is closetpunkgirl.

Musically, I'm somewhat eclectic, but I definitely have preferences and definitely know what I do <i>not</i> like.  My favorite music is probably what many would call ""angry girl music,"" but, believe it or not, I am not an angry girl.  I guess that's my way of venting.  I have a fascination with punk.  I am also obsessed with cover bands.  I tried to make Me First and the Gimme Gimmes one of my interests, but I guess livejournal doesn't recognize them as a proper interest.  We (and by ""we,"" I actually mean ""I"" in the royal sense) do not listen to boy bands or their female counterparts, although a well-done, punk-ish cover of such songs will not go unappreciated.

As far as movies go, I don't know how to describe my tastes.  Here's a list that will give you some idea, though:  Memento, The Big Lebowski, The Royal Tannenbaums, Amelie, The Hudsucker Proxy, and The Usual Suspects.  Oh, and Christopher Guest is a genius.

I love a good meal.  I mostly eat junk food (I should buy stock in Taco Bueno), and I have been known to drink a few meals (prohibitionist, I am not), but I also love a good Cajun gumbo or something spicy and Thai.  First and foremost, though, I love cheese and would probably eat an old shoe if you smothered it in enough baby gouda.

What are your three M's?"

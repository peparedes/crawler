<b>Author's Notes:</b> dedicated to <a href=""http://oftwhat.tumblr.com/"">Oft</a> for a very belated birthday present and ALL THAT DAMN FINE FOODPORN. i don't even know what this did at points and it's pretty disjointed but i hope you like it~

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
Alan had been enjoying a quiet night at home with a book and enjoying Bullet Time Hand Job's newest album when Flynn had frantically dragged him out, raving about how he'd broken the Tron program or some nonsense. The Grid had been quite a surprise (although it <i>had</i> made his friend suddenly quite a bit less insane) but Flynn apparently didn't have time to explain it to him.

The two stood in front of giant cake. Cheesecake, raspberry, apparently. Alan's favorite, although he wasn't sure Flynn knew that. His friend was wringing his hands, obviously worried, and Alan was still simply stuck in a great state of confusion.

""He's been up there for hours, now. Days, really, in the time I went to get you, time dilation and --- it doesn't matter, Alan, I can't get him down!"" Alan nodded vacantly.

""I'll, um. Go see what I can do. Haven't ever had to talk to a program before..."" Flynn led him over to the ladder he'd set up on the side and Alan clambered up, trying not to be overwhelmed by the <i>delicious</i> smell as he got closer.

The cake was apparently not the only delicious thing around.

Flynn had told him the programs looked human, sure, but on the way here they hadn't crossed the path of a single one. He hadn't known they were clad in skin-tight suits, bodies lean and well-trained and <i>god</i>, Alan did not stray often, but the sight of this guy stretched out and dripping with raspberry sauce was positively pornographic. He had to remind himself that he was here for a reason.

""...Tron?"" The program glanced over his shoulder, eyes wide and innocent. And that was yet <i>another</i> thing Flynn had forgotten to mention. Suddenly his nickname made a whole hell of a lot more sense, though. Tron scrambled up, attempting to salute and ending up lopsided and looking generally ridiculous.

""Alan_1."" His voice, too, and that shouldn't have been nearly as appealing as he was making it. Alan stepped onto the cake - slippery but he kept his footing, making his way over to Tron and gently brushing his hand down. No reason for so much formality. ""Why are you here...?"" Alan smiled.

""Flynn's worried about you. He thinks he's broken you."" Tron broke out into a grin and Alan couldn't help but smile. ""I knew he was spouting nonsense. Even he couldn't break a good program like you."" The... circuits? He supposed that's what they were. Lines of light, covering Tron like snakes. In any case, they flashed purple in a wave, starting at his collar and speeding down. Alan had no idea what that meant.

""This 'food' that Flynn has created is... exquisite."" He licked a dab of sauce off his finger and Alan flushed, trying not to stare too obviously. ""I just can't get enough."" He held out a finger, pressing it against Alan's lips, smiling. ""Try some.""

He did, nearly automatically, tongue curling around the program's finger as he sucked it into his mouth, cheeks flushing more as he realized how lewd he was being. The sauce <i>was</i> seriously delicious though - Alan felt as if he were going weak in the knees.

Tron's moan broke him out of his own thoughts and he looked back up, bewildered. Now, Alan hadn't ever watched himself during sex or anything, but he certainly knew himself well enough to know what <i>that</i> look on his face meant. He belatedly released Tron's finger, completely unsure what to do now.

The look in Tron's eyes as his eyes fluttered open floored him. Heat, searing heat backed by something Alan was pretty sure was hero worship although he'd never had either directed at him. The program licked his lips deliberately and just kept <i>staring</i> at him. Alan may have begun to stammer something just as Tron moved foward, sealing their lips together.

Kissing his twin was probably the last thing Alan would have ever thought could be enjoyable. But he tasted like raspberry cheesecake mixed with the clean tang of electricity and he was making these little noises and his hand was winding around Alan's neck and sending the most pleasurable little tingles down his spine.

He was standing on top of a giant cheesecake, programs were people, and he was inside of a computer. A bit of infedelity was the least of his problems, and somehow he didn't think Lora would mind. In fact, he had a feeling that were she to meet Tron, she would have a similar reaction.

And Tron was pushing him backwards down into the cake and this was <i>not</i> the time to think about some sort of menage a trois so he should focus on <i>not</i> flailing like an idiot. He probably failed spectacularly, getting immediately covered in raspberry sauce and sticking everywhere. It was apparently less of an issue as Tron dissolved his suit as easily as Flynn had whipped it up and the sauce was a good deal colder than it looked and that should be far less worrying than being naked but it wasn't, somehow, and Tron was still all over him.

He couldn't think straight, much less gather himself to do anything coherent. Tron continued kissing him insistently, suit dripping globs of sauce down onto his chest, air between them charged with literal electricity. Tron shifted, moving down to lick up streams of sauce off his chest, slowly moving downwards, Alan's mental processes completely destroyed between the cool sauce and the tiny shocks he was recieving from Tron's tongue.

It only got worse as Tron deliberately scooped a handful of the stuff over his cock and then descended upon it. He was enthusiastic and messy, swapping sauce for spit, sucking and nipping and enjoying himself far too much for being the one giving the pleasure. Alan buried his hands deep in Tron's hair and pulled more than he meant to, moaning deeply.

Tron shot him a wicked look, laying a line of kisses up him again before moving back up, capturing his lips and putting that same mouth to work invading his own. Alan's hands remained firmly rooted in his partner's hair, body making half-formed motions upwards. As the program pulled back he noticed that his circuits were bright purple; on an impulse he slid his hand down to trace one of the lines, biting his tongue at the noise that Tron made. Fascinated, he continued, following it all the way down and watching the program writhe under his touch.

""Beautiful."" That was his voice, and it had come from  his mouth, or at least that's what the stunned look on Tron's face implied. Alan flushed, pulling his hands away, looking away until his mouth was quite ferociously captured once more. Not bad, not embarrassing, apparently hot, and worthy of a shift and move and Tron <i>was</i> beautiful, arching above him, licking his lips and keeping <i>extremely</i> direct eye contact as he lowered himself down and oh, oh, Alan shook and gripped his hips with white knuckles.

This wasn't any different than normal sex, fundamentally, but between the cheesecake and the doppleganger program and the literal electric charge that was building - it was certainly the oddest sex Alan had had, and probably the kinkiest. But it was still something that he knew how to do <i>well</i> (Tron was not, by a longshot, the first person to ride him) and when he heard the hitch in Tron's breath and felt the tense of his thighs he pushed harder, angling there again, thrusting there more urgently.

Tron's moans deepened, gaining a measure of desperation, probably matching Alan's own. Those circuits of his were nearly red now, pulsing slightly with their movements. On a sudden impulse, Alan leaned up and dragged Tron down, licking at the squares at the base of his throat. The program shouted, pushing Alan's head against his chest and shuddering as he released under the sudden stimulation. The circuits under his tongue surged and Alan had the sudden feeling of licking an extremely powerful battery, the lightning current shooting through him. Combined with the sight, smell, sound, <i>feeling</I> of Tron's pleasure, it sent him reeling over the edge as well, hot and fast and far too soon.

They collapsed back into the cake, gooey sauce still surrounding them, their actions having merely created a kind of canyon that kept dripping more of the stuff down on them. Alan came down from the high fast, still panting and hot but clear-headed, stroking Tron's back gently. He watched as the program's circuits slowly cooled back to what he assumed was a deep, satisfied blue, his weight settling gently atop his user.

It was awkward, he supposed, but only because he didn't know program etiquette - or, indeed, anything at all about them. Flynn didn't do that sort of thing, the dolt, and even if he had he'd probably have forgotten to mention it. If he was at home, though, he'd have waited for Tron to make a move before either sending him off forever with a kiss or making him breakfast, depending on said move. So he did, basically, the same thing here.

After a few long minutes, Tron shifted, laying light kisses down Alan's neck. He smiled, digging his fingers in just a bit more and appreciating the groan that sent his way. Tron sat up, then, circuits flushing back to a light purple.

""Alan_1."" The user nodded, indicating that he should continue. Tron bit his lip, gaze shifting away before focusing back on him. ""Request for... further exploration of this topic."" Alan chuckled, cupping his face gently between his two hands and pulling him down a bit so he could kiss him ever so lightly.

""Request pending. Lora-3 has priority on this information."" Tron flushed further at that, blinking owlishly at his user.

""You and... Lora-3?"" Alan nodded, unable to keep a smile off his face. The program was far too cute for his own good. ""It was like that once here... Yori and I..."" The laser program, Yori. Well, apparently programs mimicked the real world in more ways than one. Alan tapped Tron's cheek, prompting yet another flush.

""We can talk, Tron, but I believe that a slightly more clean, clothed, and foodless environment would be more appropriate."" Even the program couldn't help but smile at that, re-engaging his own suit and then Alan's.

When Alan saw Flynn again, especially as it was after hearing some of the more ridiculous loopholes in the system, he punched him square in the jaw. Tron barely stopped Clu from ripping him to shreds before Flynn laughed and clapped him on the shoulder.

""I should have never started this without you, buddy.""

<b>Title:</b> break
<b>Rating:</b> NC-17
<b>Warnings:</b> OC, possible OOC, lots of assumptions and ridiculousness
<b>Word Count:</b> ~1400
<b>Summary:</b> <i>Ooh, really smitten.</i>
<b>Author's Notes:</b> another bit for my <a href=""http://ekala-sy-eph.livejournal.com/60426.html"">fic commission/exchange/request/trade</a>, dedicated to <a href=""http://blackguardvamp.tumblr.com/"">Vamp</a>. really hoping I didn't fuck you up or make Sam sound like too much of a ho. but he really wanted to be a ho.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
Sam hadn't been expecting this, but it was an intriguing opportunity. Rinzler had dumped him on one of the Blackguard leaders and left, expecting said program to pass him off to one of the footsoldiers and make him do sentry work for the next few microcycles. Instead, he'd kept him around. Even taken his helmet off, which made him far more interesting than the rest of Clu's army that he'd seen.

He watched him work. <i>Closely</i> watched him work. He was organizing armies and guardposts, relaying information from one source to another. Sam could learn something. Especially if he could just distract him for a minute, get closer and see everything clearly laid out...

If there was one thing Sam was good at, it was distraction.

""So, you run <i>all</i> of this?"" He slid over, pressing close. From what he'd seen programs didn't have all that pesky trouble with social taboos. Made distractions much easier. Especially considering this particular guard couldn't keep his eyes off him. He'd barely looked away since Sam walked in. Sam put his best innocent face on, looking up at him. ""That's quite impressive.""

""...yes, well."" Ooh, really smitten. Sam glanced down at the console but then returned his gaze to the program, smiling.

""How do you handle all of it, day after day? Doesn't it get terribly boring?"" He tapped a line down the program's arm, smirking inwardly as the circuits under his fingers flushed purple. The information was important, and Sam didn't particularly want to follow through, but he was rather frustrated lately (a full guard duty didn't allow much time for playing) and this guard was certainly not hard on the eyes.

""Not at all. It's my function."" Sam wet his lips, watching as the program nearly tripped over himself. ""...although it does not need constant attention.""

""Vamp, right? Interesting name..."" He laughed, keeping it short and sweet. ""Some users would think you were crazy."" That earned him a slightly blank stare. Programs, yeah. ""Loopy, insane. Buggy, I guess?""

""...I'm hardly buggy. I'm one of the Programmer's own creations."" He looked almost like he wanted to say more, but he stopped himself. ""...users can be quite interesting.""

""I could show you just how interesting we can get. If you have time to take a break, of course."" He smiled prettily again, taking another glance down at the console.

It was the suddenness more than anything that startled him; one moment he was pressed against the side of this guardsman and the next he was pinned to the console, mouth under siege. He gasped as he was let go, mouth tingling from a faint aftercharge the program left. Vamp's eyes burned red and Sam licked his lips, smirking. Definitely doing this.

""Get back here."" He hooked an arm around Vamp's neck, pulling him back down for another searing kiss. Hands roamed over his sides, leaving a trail of tingling in their wake, before gripping his thighs and forcefully lifting him off the console. Sam made a noise halfway out of protest, arms tightening around the program's shoulders.

""What, you have some secret lovenest up here?"" he managed as they broke apart again, his sarcastic tone still not masking his flushed face or heavy breath. Vamp smirked, shifting Sam into a more secure grip.

""Wouldn't want to disturb any operations, that's all. Besides,"" he slammed Sam up against the wall, pinning him effectively, letting one leg down to steady them both. ""You look better like this."" Sam felt another spike of lust run through him, further cementing his plan of action. He smiled, tangling one hand up in Vamp's hair.

""Then get on with it already."" More sudden action and Sam suddenly felt rather bare in his torso area and he'd forgotten how quickly the suits could come off and <i>gloves</i>, those were gloves, that wasn't a kink but damn did they feel good and he was going to need some lube if the guy was going to keep going. He pushed at him a bit, attempting to formulate more words.

""L-lube, fuck!"" He cursed as Vamp halfway attempted to push one finger into him, squirming as the blackguard laughed. The glove was disappearing quickly, though.

""Haven't heard someone ask for that in cycles. Are all users like this?"" Sam would have snapped back at him but Vamp's fingers were getting coated in lube as easily as their suits had come off. Grid magic or something, he swore, pressing back on those fingers as they slipped inside him. Vamp looked far too smug, though, so Sam dragged his fingernails up the program's back and bit at his ear.

""Feisty. Knew you would be,"" he muttered, as if Sam couldn't hear him. He squirmed again, swatting futiley at his head. Vamp smiled, curling his fingers and working them faster. ""That wasn't an insult."" Sam moaned, his voice cutting out halfway, clutching at Vamp's back and burying his face in his neck.

Vamp shifted them, hoisting Sam a bit higher and removing his fingers as he did so. His now-free hand tangled in Sam's hair, pulling his head back so they were face to face again. The user smirked, licking his lips again, deliberately grinding up against the blackguard. Vamp smiled, kissing him softly and pushing up and in.

Sam's jaw clenched and he hissed, clinging to the program. Slow, slick, and he felt so damn good, everything sparks and fire and lightning. Vamp finished entering him with a quick thrust and Sam gasped, throwing his head back, just barely avoiding hurting himself on the wall though it made a spectacular thud nonetheless. He stayed like that for a few moments, panting and overheating and <i>full</i>, squeezing his eyes shut but knowing Vamp was watching him, waiting. A slow breath, in and out, and he nodded slowly, biting his lip.

He drew blood at the first full thrust, teeth slicing through his lip as his entire body tensed. Vamp grunted, pushing harder than he probably meant to, bouncing Sam up the wall. He took the user's other leg again, hand slipping under his thigh and pulling it up to the same position as its cohort, wrapped around his waist. They fell into a steady rhythm shortly, fast but not too hard, enough to let them both enjoy it.

Sam let out noises on each thrust, half-formed moans and gasps, arms still tight around the program. He didn't want to open his eyes, meet the unadulterated passion and adoration in the other's, deal with the smirk still lingering on his face. So he kept his eyes shut and just enjoyed it all, lost himself in the short thrusts and the way his back kept sliding up the wall and how on the end of each cycle Vamp would clutch ever so barely at the back of his thighs, breath hitching.

Not surprisingly, neither of them lasted long. Sam came undone just as Vamp pressed a line of wet kisses up his throat, the electric energy providing the final spark. He moaned, low and rough, his hips rocking up as he splattered white over his stomach and Vamp's. Another two, three, four thrusts and Vamp joined him, growling and burying a bite at Sam's collarbone.

They stayed tangled together for a while, leaning heavily on the wall, Sam panting and Vamp's circuits sparking. Slowly, carefully, Vamp let Sam down and withdrew from him, making sure he could stand before letting go nearly completely. He left one hand on Sam's hip and the other on his shoulder, just barely stroking his neck, their suits both slowly rerezzing.

""Well."" Sam sighed, finally getting a hold of himself again. ""That was..."" He must have sounded disappointed, as Vamp drew away completely. ""Ah, no, that is."" Sam floundered. Always was bad after finishing up one-night stands.

""Perahps I should put in a request to have you moved to my supervision."" Sam blinked. ""After all, there's hardly any reason to keep you locked up. You've proven that you have little desire to leave here."" Well, that wasn't quite true, but Sam would jump at the chance to get out of those damn cells.

""Sounds good."" He smiled, cheekily. ""Maybe I could help with your work more often."" Vamp smiled back.

""Perhaps. Speaking of..."" Sam laughed, pushing him back towards the console.

<b>Summary:</b> <i>Jane knew.</i>
<b>Author's Notes:</b> another bit for my <a href=""http://ekala-sy-eph.livejournal.com/60426.html"">fic commission/exchange/request/trade</a>, dedicated to <lj user=""yanagoya"">. hope it's satisfactory, darling.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
Jane knew. He knew everything about people, all the time. Infuriating but true.

Cho wasn't sure of his intentions when he told him he needed new clothes, but he damn well had an idea. 

""C'mon, in here."" Far too nice. He couldn't possibly...

""Jane, I can't afford any of these."" He just smiled that impossibly aggravating smile and gestured him inside.

""Don't worry about it. I've got you covered."" Cho attempted to protest again but Jane simply shushed him, ushering him inside.

An hour later, Cho had a brand-new suit as per Jane's instructions. Far too nice for his own taste but Jane had insisted, telling him it was vital for the scene they were setting up later.

The detour to his place was unexpected but not unreasonable. Jane had insisted they needed to make him up or something. Cho had no idea what this entailed but flirting lessons were certainly not one of them.

""Oh, don't give me that look. I have to make sure you can carry this all out correctly."" Cho made his look simply more withering. ""Besides, I know you like me and this'll be the perfect time to clear up the air regarding that.""

Cho's heart nearly stopped. Jane knew everything. Dammit.

""Oh come on, don't look like that. It only makes sense. I am rather dashing."" Cho had never before wanted to punch someone so much. ""Come on, then. First rule.""

Cho didn't let him finish. He pushed Jane against the nearest wall, kissing him forcefully and tearing at that damned vest.  For the record, that infuriating smile was even <i>more</i> infuriating when pressed against his own lips. Cho knew he was going to regret letting Jane breathe.

""Don't do that. She might get put off by your, ah, lack of tact."" Cho growled, ripping off Jane's shirt, pinning him further against the wall. He started to say something else but Cho cut him off by clamping a hand over his mouth, the other fumbling with his belt. He might have been loud but he wasn't protesting - Jane wasn't stupid, he wouldn't have mentioned it in the first place if he didn't want anything.

His own belt was easy enough to get off; thankfully he'd insisted that the new suit travel back in a garment bag. It was worth almost three months of his salary, he wasn't going to get it ruffled from driving or something before he got to use it. It made all of this far easier.

Cho was half-tempted to blindfold Jane, even if that would have taken away one of his most beautiful features. Even without the use of his mouth, Jane was obviously amused with this turn of events. He still bucked into the touch when Cho palmed him through his pants, though. Jane was only human and that was, somehow, the best part. Bringing someone who put himself one step above the rest down to this.

And this was good enough for the moment; humping him like a teenager against the wall. It was fast and efficient - they still had to get back to real work - and let him really <i>work</i> out that frustration he'd been feeling. He still wanted to split him open and mark him but - when they had more time, when there wasn't a deadline.

Hands clutching at his jacket jerked him sharply back to the moment, Jane's whimpering audible even behind his hand. <i>That</i> was a pretty sight; dazed eyes and flushed face and everything hard and hot against him. He tensed and jerked and then he was spilling himself over Cho's hand, normal suave composure completely lost. That image and a couple more tugs pushed Cho over the edge as well, grunting softly.

He shot Jane another look before letting him go, wandering over to the sink, grabbing a wet cloth and wiping himself off. Jane was wearing that smile again by the time he handed it to him, cleaning himself as well before shrugging his shirt back on.

""I really do need to teach you how to flirt, don't I."" Cho dusted himself off, readjusting his suit. He wasn't going to give Jane the pleasure of looking at him at the moment.

""I'll be fine."" Jane chuckled, patting him on the back and slyly slipping an arm over his shoulder.

""I trust you. I'll be there the whole time regardless."" Cho sent him a side glance, shrugging his arm off and moving back towards the door, grabbing the suit on the way.

""Let's go. We've got work to do.""

The last thing Sam remembered was being in his cell. He'd probably fallen asleep or something. God, he needed it, after all that had happened.

This all would have been par for the course, had he not woken up and been barely able to move. He immediately began struggling, of course, testing the bonds best he could. The landscape didn't seem any different; all that black and glowy shit. Unhelpful. There was a gag of some type in his mouth - fabric, though nothing familiar - only barely keeping him from talking intelligably. Arms were bound behind his back, cuffs secured around his upper arms and again around his wrists. Legs cuffed at the ankle and kept apart by what must have been some type of bar. Whoever did this knew what they were doing.

Sam didn't bother continuing his struggle for long. Tiring himself out wouldn't help and while he was constricted none of the bonds were uncomfortable. Seriously knew what they were doing. He was ass-up, sure, and that was going to get hard on his knees even on the soft surface he'd been deposited on.

He sat in silence for a while, mulling over the situation. Unfortunately, every situation he could think of ended up in the same way: some <i>program</i> forcibly having sex with him. The thought repulsed him. He could still only halfway believe any of this was happeneing.

Footsteps shook him out of his reverie. He struggled again, just a bit, to let his current captor know that he was awake and kicking, so to speak. A gloved hand slid possessively over the curve of his ass and he snarled.

""Now, now, Sam. No reason to be so hostile."" The color drained from his face. Anyone but him. ""You look wonderful presented like this. It seems good looks, ah... what was the phrase. 'Run in the family'?"" Sam thrashed again. Maybe there was a weakness he'd missed the first time. His disobedience earned him a hard slap and he gasped, shuddering as the suit still slick against him began falling away from the point of impact.

Gold circuits slipped into view as the program shifted, slipping around to the side of him. He was still fully-clothed, circuits brighter than Sam seemed to remember them. The user's stomach rolled as he wondered, briefly, what that meant. He refused to even look at his face - he wasn't sure he could take that at the moment.

""I've got quite an array of items to try on you, user. Things from my own experience and a few gleamed from your rather interesting history."" That brought an unbidden flush to his face. This was far beyond anything he'd done but he couldn't say he hadn't thought about it.

And whatever he reached for beyond the edge of Sam's vision rattled. God, fuck, he was so screwed.

""Don't look so afraid, Sam. I have no intention of hurting you."" He chuckled darkly, a sound that his father never would have made. ""At least not physically."" Another touch from those cold gloves, roaming over his shoulder blades. ""You are far too well-made for that."" A sudden, sharp buzzing ran up the length of his dick and Sam moaned, bucking forward as much as he could. Another chuckle, though the user barely caught it over the already-incessant buzzing, pleasure shooting through him.

""So eager."" He was not hard already. ""Let's make sure I don't wear you out too fast."" What the hell did - the vibrator was gone, replaced by a tight pressure encircling him. Cock ring. This was already getting off to a great start. Clu shifted again, back behind him, seeming to settle behind him. That wasn't a good sign.

A liberal amount of freezing lubricant was applied far too quickly, making yet another sound slip out from behind the gag. Sam squirmed, growling as fingers began pushing inside. He was unreceptive but it still felt so <i>good</i> and Sam was quickly regretting ever venturing into this field of pleasure in the first place.

The fingers were quickly withdrawn, though. Clu wanted to play, but apparently not in that way. He started shifting, leaving Sam open and alone while he began to... pick something out, or something. A few hums and huhs later and Sam was being forced open again, by something still relatively thin. He could handle that.

But it just kept coming. And coming. Sam felt tears slip down his face before he let himself let out another sound, body shaking. Another moment and he cried out, trying to communicate around the gag that Clu needed to stop and do it now, voice frantic.

""Impressive."" Sam was just grateful he stopped, immediately beginning to draw what felt more and more like a torture device out of him. A pause, a noise of interest, and then another one was pushing at him. This one was shorter; average, anyways, and pretty much exceedingly normal. Clu thrust a couple of times with it, finding Sam's good spot on the third, exploiting it mercilessly another thrust. Sam groaned, squirming again, pleasure so soon after pain a little hard to swallow.

That toy was removed and replaced with another, a little thicker. Another, and another, and another. He'd tested depth and now he was testing width, apparently, and Sam was afraid about how far he'd go. The fifth one stretched. The sixth <i>burned</i> and Sam was shaking again, voice pleading. But then there was a seventh and there were tears, desperation sneaking back into his voice.

""Users are apparently far more flexible than I was expecting."" He sounded amused, the bastard. And still only clinically interested. Insult to injury. ""Messier than programs, though."" He slipped a thumb in, rubbing raw areas, making Sam cry out again as pain shot through his legs.

The program moved, and it sounded like he was gathering things up - putting them back into whatever they came in from. Maybe he was actually <i>done</i>.

""Let's take a little break, shall we?"" More shifting, and Clu was sitting in front of him, gold filling his vision, blinding after the dark landscape. Sam refused to think about what was going to happen. A firm hand grasped his chin and another his shoulder, pulling him up and attempting to make him look at that damned face. The hand on his jaw tightened, though, and he glared up at him before the program broke his skull.

""You really do have a pretty face, Sam. Gorgeous eyes. And a mouth that could be put to much better uses. Unfortunately I don't trust you enough to cross that particular line, yet."" Sam glared harder, now wholly unable to see his father's face behind the cruelty this one wore so easily. ""Perhaps it's because you have such fire in your eyes.""

He dropped him, Sam nearly biting his tongue as he bounced off one of his captor's legs. Fucker didn't give two shits about him. Clu moved around again, picking something else that he'd apparently saved for last. It felt like any of the other ones again - average size, again.

""Something special for you."" Something clicked and it started buzzing, Sam moaning immediately. Vibrators had always gotten him going more than plain dildos and it was everything in all the right places. The cock ring popped off and Clu's hand was around him before Sam could even attempt to protest, stroking him hard. The sudden and complete pleasure overwhelmed him quickly and he writhed, spilling himself over the program's glove.

Sam was fairly sure there weren't words for how dirty that makes someone feel.

He came back down as the vibrator was being slipped back out of his ass, replaced quickly by something far firmer. He thrashed, a bit, but it was no use - the plug was firmly seated inside him. Clu tapped the end of it, probably smiling by the tone in his voice.

""Be a good boy and keep that until I need you again, will you? I'm sure it's comfortable."" Sam would have growled but he was simply too tired. The restraints on him popped off one by one, his knees slipping out from under him and pushing the plug deeper as he collapsed against the bed. His shoulders were sore, too, and he was sure he'd ache everywhere when he could actually think straight.

""There. Rest now."" The gag was pulled off, Sam's suit sliding back on over him, a blanket pulled around him. Clu's hand slid through his hair, cold lips pressed against his forehead. ""Perhaps when I return you will be more amicable.""

The last thing Sam thought before he fell back into sleep was that, well, perhaps he would. Just to... spite him. Yes, that was the reason.

<b>Author's Notes:</b> another bit of fic for my <a href=""http://ekala-sy-eph.livejournal.com/60426.html"">fic commission/request/exchange/trade</a>, dedicated to <lj user=""okami_hu"">. Sark refused to really cooperate and it's kind of weird but here it is.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
Sark wasn't sure what the MCP thought the program had that he didn't. He was a perfectly functional security program and unlike Tron there was not a single chance he'd ever betray the Master Control. But his orders were to attempt to get the program to cooperate, and he always followed orders.

Unfortunately he was not easily swayed. The promise of endless power had no effect on him. Faith was apparently a powerful thing, even when it was baseless and inane. Sark cycled through the prizes; power, space, sub-processors, energy, top priority access... nothing even seemed to tempt him.

Sark mulled over it for centicycles. It struck him, finally, as the MCP poured his almighty glory into his own frame. He'd share with Tron what the Master Control shared with him: the pleasure of true power flowing through a system. Unfortunately he could not leave himself open to attack and the power transferal process was a private affair so guards were out of the question.

""You already know I can withstand your torture, Sark."" He didn't dignify that with a reply, circling the program, noting key circuit convergences. Tron struggled against the bonds holding him to the upright frame, usually attached to logic probe circuits, though those were currently hooked into the MCP's mainframe instead. The Master Control himself did not care if Sark tapped into his power occasionally; it was useful when he needed an extra boost to his own capabilities - or to the punishment of the conscripts.

""You have resisted my efforts so far, program. You still believe in the Users."" Tron snarled at him. So primitive. ""I am prepared to give you something only the MCP is capable of providing."" That stilled him. Perhaps he would come around to reason, after all. Sark began the power flow, slowly, watching the program's expression carefully. Ah, there. The subtle clench of his jaw, the gentle ripple of blue turning to violet. Not even the vaunted Tron could resist this.

""Let go. Let the MCP guide you."" Sark circled around to his back again, putting gentle pressure on the points he'd noted earlier. Tron shook lightly, circuits bright under the commander's fingers. Beautiful, really. He was well-coded, for sure. Another press, two thumbs on either side of his hips, had him gasping and shuddering forward.

He turned up the power, thoroughly enjoying the pleasured groan it ripped out of Tron's throat. Sark's own circuits were brightening slowly, the power flowing through Tron's circuits and into his own. He felt the tug, the pull, the need to get closer, to absorb all of the power for himself. Tempting. He moved forward, pressing his chest against the program's back, hissing as his own circuits reacted quickly to the power now flowing through them both.

""Get off of me, Sark,"" Tron growled, voice just that side of strained. Sark hummed, only pushing himself more firmly against the blue-violet circuits, sending a surge through them both.

""Your precious users can't give you this, can they? The... <i>pleasure</i> of pure power like this."" His attempt to keep the breathlessness out of his voice was unsuccessful. Nothing got his circuits running faster than this power. ""Isn't it perfectly wonderful?"" He ran his hands over another circuit exchange, then another, then another. Tron moaned underneath him, circuits bursting with color and light, making Sark shudder in turn.

It took surprisingly little time for Sark to disassemble him completely; another few well-placed brushes and the security program came completely undone, overloading in a white flash and a low groan. Sark kept the power flowing through him, using Tron's body as a conduit until he, too, felt the power overwhelm him.

After the program had been released and was flanked once more by guards, Sark asked him for the last time if he would convert. Tron fixed him with a glare Sark was fairly sure he'd keep in his memory banks until his deresolution, and spoke that same infuriating phrase as always.

""I fight for the users."" Sark frowned, gesturing for the guards to take him back to his cell.

""Then you shall fight to your death.""

<b>Author's Notes:</b> part 5 of the <a href=""http://ekala-sy-eph.livejournal.com/60017.html#cutid1"">axton!verse</a>. two hundred cycles is roughly four years in user time. rinzler's headspace is infinitely odd at the moment. this may be completely reworked later. i told you all i wasn't good at anything beyond sex, okay.

They found him.

But that's not where this began.

Rinzler watches. He acts, when his programmer commands. But he is mostly a shadow enforcer; the knowledge of his very existence, his presence, these stop a large portion of what he would have to deal with otherwise. 

It is only with Axton that he is allowed to do as he likes, given that he does not go outside the range of his programmer's orders. It's intoxicating. He still knows, after all. He <i>watched</i>, when Clu tore his code open and fixed it from the inside, bent a <i>user</i> to his will. It was possible, if far more difficult than doing the same with a program. And not just any user but <i>his</i> user, who would now bend to his will, be his slave if he so wished it.

Rinzler wanted no such thing.

He protects Axton. Leads him into the light, the wonder that is loving and serving their programmer. He teaches him how to fight, how to pleasure, how to kill, makes them the same in every way even though he can smell the blood still pulsing in the veins hidden beneath his skin, hidden beneath false circuits and pile of lies.

He takes him for his <i>own</i>, when Clu does not want them. It is much the same feeling as he has for his programmer - protective and possessive, but the need to own him completely is unique to the user. Perhaps simply because he could never own his programmer; his programmer owns him and he will forever be owned by him. Rinzler would die for both, for either, has killed and would kill again. Anything to keep them.

Their life is simple, after Axton has adjusted to his programming. They destroy any resistance to their programmer's plans. They guard him. They pleasure him, when he is not busy. When he is they train, or busy themselves with each other. Rinzler becomes known as the Enforcer, and Axton as the Eliminator. Still, there is one shadow that hangs over them.

They found him.

It was bound to happen. Resistance was few and far between and easily squashed when it did arise. Both he and Axton had had plenty of time to run the process that Clu had derived from a mixture of his own code (a reflection of <i>his</i>) and Axton's user code, a scanning system that would pinpoint his location. It had taken nearly two hundred cycles but the time had only made them stronger.

Clu only sends the pair of them. He cannot trust any other program around the other user. They are the only two loyal and strong enough to resist any reprogramming he may attempt. Rinzler cannot admit it, but he is glad. Anyone besides Axton would simply get in the way. He wants to personally rip the user apart, for all the trespasses he'd committed against his programmer.

They find an ISO, first. Rinzler can tell the moment he sees her, though Axton seems confused. She seems to intend to fight them and they both drop into a fighting stance just before <i>he</i> appears in the doorway behind her.

""Quorra. Run."" She looks enraged, he thinks, as she looks between them and the user. Still, she pushes past him and leaves, and neither of them will follow. She will certainly be a pest but they are not here for her. They have their orders. Neither moves for a long moment, the silence stretching between them.

He moves first, stepping into the room, hands still folded behind his back. Rinzler watches as always, Axton mirroring him. He steps to the right, Axton to the left, both of them circling slowly for a moment until they lunge, Axton sliding across the floor to knock the user off his feet, Rinzler holding a disc out meant to be buried in his throat. They both hit what seems to be an invisible forcefield, stopping Axton but sending Rinzler flying across the room. He hits the wall with a sickening crunch, helmet beginning to crack. Axton growls and rolls backwards, springing up and hitting the field with both discs, attempting to break it. The user sighs and increases the energy, the field expanding and changing until Axton, too, is sent flying across the room.

""I don't want to hurt either of you."" Rinzler is behind him now, creeping across the floor, silent as he can be. ""Go back to Clu and tell him that he won't be able to find me next time. I'll hide more carefully."" The program lunges again, making it through the field as the user hadn't seen him, a disc slicing across the user's arm before a blast of energy sends him flying again. His helmet dissolves this time, in a gentle tinkle of pixels, his side similarly damaged. The user's posture changes, relaxing and tensing all at once, losing the easiness it just had. His face shows his surprise as he steps hesitantly towards him.

""Tron?"" The name rips a feral growl from the program's throat. He was not that monster. Not anymore. Clu had fixed him, made him see the error of his ways, shown him the light. He tried to move, to get up, but his legs were not responding to the messages he sent. Instead he simply glared, red eyes hard as steel.

<i>He</i> seems to suddenly remember something, face draining of color. Rinzler feels <i>smug</i>, almost, as he knows what the user is thinking. Indeed, he turns towards his partner, who has one damaged arm as well a similarly broken helmet. Rinzler <i>knows</i> he can tell that Axton was once the user named Alan_1, regardless of the layers of fakery Clu had pasted on top of that. He was sad, really, that he couldn't see his face. It was probably infinitely amusing. Something he'd have to get from Axton's memory banks later.

""Alan."" His voice was quiet, the self-assured tone it had lost completely to astonishment and despair. ""Alan, please."" A sob. He was <i>crying</i>. How quaint. Axton continued advancing, though it was slow, now. He seemed to sense that the user would no long hurt him. ""Listen to me. Clu's done something to you. Brainwashed you. This... this isn't you. You wouldn't do..."" Another sob. Perhaps he knew of their exploits. The ISO must have been keeping him informed. Rinzler hoped he now remembered every one and suffered for every bit of his so-called friend that they'd taken. ""You can't do this. I can still fix the system. I can still do... something. I'll...""

Axton was not listening. Clu had taught him too well. He approaches him, not even bothering to reactivate his disc, punching him once with a solid right. The user skids to the floor, putting up no resistance. His face is stained with tears, now that Rinzler can see it. He looks positively terrified. It's wonderful. Axton kicks him, rolling him over and wrenching the disc off his back, tossing the white circle to Rinzler. He turns it once in his hands. It doesn't look any different than any other disc, but he supposes it wouldn't have. Axton's hadn't.

The user was kicked again, rolling back onto his back, silently crying now. Utterly useless, really. Rinzler was glad they'd gotten the order to execute him, as Clu wished to make an example of him, not bothering to reprogram him. Axton raised his disc, white edge glistening deadly as always.

""Please, Alan, you know me! It's me, Kevin, Flynn, whatever stupid nickname you decided to call me, fuck, please! You are my <i>friend</i>, my confidante, my everything! Don't... please, fight it, something!"" Axton pauses and for a long moment Rinzler is afraid that the programming may indeed not hold. His arm lowers slowly, face as impassive as always. Rinzler is about to speak to him but then he opens his own mouth, astonishing them both.

""I do not know you, User."" <i>He</i> looks lost. ""I serve only our programmer, CLU."" He raises his disc again, face turning up in a sneer. ""I would never be <i>friends</i> with a <i>monster</i> like you,"" and he drops to his knees, straddling the prone user, growling in his face, spitting out the words with more hate and malice than Rinzler even believed was possible for one program to have as the user stares, unable to look away. ""<i>User</i>.""

His hand fell, disc slashing the creator's throat.

---

By the time Rinzler is able to lift himself back up and limp over, pixels still slowly falling off of his side, Axton is covered in slowly-drying blood. He's been staring at his hand for the past few nanocycles, seemingly fascinated. Rinzler's hand on his shoulder makes him jump, looking up at him with his usual face, innocent blue eyes and all. He looks troubled, though, and Rinzler knows exactly why.

""You did very well, Axton."" That helps, a bit. ""I will not tell our master of your small break in protocol. It was deserved. You crushed him emotionally before you did so physically, and it was beautiful."" He leaned, slipping his arms around shoulders still slippery with blood. ""<i>You</i> were beautiful."" Axton shifts back into the touch, head resting on Rinzler's chest as they both take a moment to gather themselves.

""Rinzler."" He hums in acknowledgement. ""This... substance. It smells..."" Axton paused, bringing his hand back up to his face, sniffing carefully. ""It smells like me. It... is the same as what I..."" Rinzler squeezes his shoulders gently, burying a smile in his hair, nodding. Axton hums, settling again, the last of the tension flowing out of him.


""So this is how I am special."""

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
He woke slowly, again. It was mildly concerning; he should be able to snap awake, if needed. Perhaps the lack of a need precipitated his slowness. Still, something was... prodding him. There <i>was</i> a need, to <i>go</i> or <i>obey</i> but it was fuzzy, like an image where he could not quite read the words. Rinzler was there, he realized suddenly, as his awareness increased to the entire room. His double lay next to him, also looking very recently awake, eyes shining with intent.

""The programmer calls for us."" Ah, that's what it was. The world shifted back into focus and Axton smiled and nodded, rolling out of bed as easily as his partner, helmets sliding to hide identical faces. The lightrope attached to his collar appeared and Rinzler took it, leading him as they had been told. Taught? Axton knew this was the way he was to be presented to the Programmer, in any case. That was what mattered.

They stepped inside, Axton a length behind his partner, both heads bowed submissively though Axton was sure Rinzler was watching their luminary as intently as he was. The master looked impressed, he noted with a smug sense of self-pride. Axton was nothing if not a fast learner. The gold program stepped forward, taking his lead from Rinzler, pulling him closer and derezzing his helmet with a simple touch. He didn't bother to hide his admiration now, feeling a heady rush of energy simply being this close to the master program. Especially when he was... the word escaped him, momentarily, as if it didn't want to be applied. <i>Smiling,</i> he thought.

""He seems particularly well-trained. I trust it's been going well."" Rinzler must have answered affirmatively, though Axton did not or could not hear over the thrum of energy in his ears as his master's hand traced his cheekbone and looped around one ear to trail down his jaw. ""Good. And you've been training him in... all areas."" His hand forced Axton's chin up slightly, voice tinged with amusement, probably at the line of marks from his partner.

""Combat training proceeding faster than anticipated. He will not take nearly as much maintenance as originally predicted."" The words filtered through Axton's ears, though he was much more focused on the drag of a single, gold-circuited finger across the tiny delicate fractures along his throat. ""...intimate training is complete. Orientation seems to have also completed and his programming set."" Clu raised a brow, still stroking Axton's throat gently. He looked contemplative for a moment, the motion ceasing.

""Name."" Axton nearly startled. The curt command was addressed to him and he found himself responding before he'd registered the question.

""Axton."" His master smiled softly, though his voice was harsh as he spoke again.

""Function."" Easy enough.

""To protect and serve my Programmer and Master. You."" The smile reached Clu's eyes.

""And what are you?"" Now that, <i>that</i> confused him. His logic circuits whirled, the gears whirring in his head. He opened his mouth, almost ready to answer, but then lost the word, unsure. Surely he must be a program, and yet something in his being rejected that, fought it tooth and nail.

The hesitation was enough of an answer.

Clu's face twisted and Axton was suddenly on the floor, cheek stinging from the impact of a fist or a hand or something, grunting as a heavy heel dug itself into his spine. His disc was gone and his vision was blurring, mind barely able to process the audio it was receiving. The muddy gold-red shapes still made it clear that Clu was standing over him, Rinzler close to him.

""You said he was complete! And yet the most <i>important</i> bit is barely reinforced!"" His partner whimpered in a way Axton knew meant he would apologize if he could form words, followed by a heavy thud. ""How am I supposed to trust you with his training if you cannot even do something so <i>simple</i>... You know the programming alone is not enough."" Clu's heel dug further into his back and Axton gasped in pain, audio sensors also whiting out.

Within a moment, though, he'd drawn back and Axton's vision and hearing slowly returned to normal. He wearily glanced around to see Clu doing something with his disc - upgrading him, he thought, making him better and faster, certainly. His master would do nothing harmful, even in a rage such as this. Would he? The programmer angrily closed the display and locked the disc back on his dock, Axton grunting as it resynced. Clu stood again, much more gently resting his foot on Axton's lower back - a warning, this time.

""Name."" It hurt to talk, hurt to move, but he had to answer.

""Axton,"" he gasped out, trying not to cough.

""Function."" The boot didn't move away but had lightened, fractionally.

""To s-serve the... programmer."" He clawed at the floor, suddenly desperate to get up and away. Clu growled and ground his heel back down, keeping him still.

""<i>What. Are. You.</i>"" If he could just answer this, if his mouth would cooperate--

""A program!"" 

The pressure disappeared and his world flipped again, suddenly cradled against his master's chest. He curled closer, body shaking, still unsure as to what his fate was to be. Clu was gentle now, though, and it calmed him quickly. He went willingly as Clu carried him across the room, laying him face-down on what had to have been a bed in the corner. It was soft and warm and smelled of the master, he thought, burying his face in the sheets to chase the lingering scent.

Someone - had to be the Programmer, it was too heavy to be Rinzler - settled behind him, straddling his thighs and smoothing large, warm hands over his back. He moaned, muffled by the sheets, body automatically responding to the touch by attempting to arch into it, circuits flickering violet. The Programmer chuckled, laying over him and keeping his own circuits just far enough away to prevent sparking.

""That's much better, program."" Clu kissed the back of his neck, his suit falling away quickly to leave only circuits and skin. ""You prefer this, don't you, Axton. Pleasure instead of pain."" He moaned in response, squirming up against him, managing to get up onto his elbows and push his backside against the now all-too-noticeable bulge in his master's suit. ""Shh. I'll give you what you want."" Axton was insistent, though, whining and rolling back again. Clu growled and slapped his side, biting his shoulder harshly to still him.

After a long moment of forced silence, his master moved again, pressing suddenly-bare hardness against the cleft of his ass. Axton moaned shamelessly, hands tangling in the sheets, only barely suppressing the urge to move again. Clu chuckled, seemingly pleased, and pressed forward, bare and dry but Axton was relaxed and ready, not wanting to disappoint him any longer. He let out a breath he didn't know he was holding, gasping suddenly for breath, chest heaving. The programmer was enormous, filling him completely, stretching him past his previous limits and it hurt even as it made him crave more. Axton wanted Clu to rip him to pieces, to absorb him, to make them whole and one and he realized belatedly he was making these deep noises, reverberating out from somewhere inside him.

Even as he sensed it, the programmer's hand clamped over his mouth, that silky-smooth voice growling low in his ears. It washed over him, nearly as pleasurable as the hard thick slide of Clu inside him, adding to the slow-building pressure behind every circuit line. The words had the tone of command in them, though, sharp and hard and cutting through the haze to reach his core systems, clear as crystal.

""From now on, your voice is <i>mine</i>. You will talk to no one except myself and Rinzler."" Push-pull-slide-heat-pain-pleasure-<i>please</i>. ""The only commands you will follow are my own, and then only from my mouth and not passed on by some secondary agent. Other programs will lie to you, will hurt you, will <i>derezz</i> you--"" He trailed off into angry growls again, words incomprehensible between the in-out friction heat.

The programmer pulsed inside him, pleasure pouring inside him and flowing over his circuits, sparking his systems but not enough, just barely on the edge. Axton whimpered, <i>sobbed</i>, shaking from the strain of holding his processes at such a high level without being able to go into overload. He was sure he was begging behind his programmer's hand, still firmly clasped over his lips, but he still couldn't see or hear much at all.

But then he was sliding out, pulling away completely, leaving Axton a purple, shaking mess on the bed. His vision and hearing cleared slightly, not completely overclocked, even though he still had little to no control of himself. He could still feel the programmer's energy inside him, hot and cool and wet somehow all at once.

""That's no good."" Axton definitely was not expecting the smack across his backside, sending another ripple of pleasure through him, gasping and collapsing and relaxing. The hand slid down between his thighs, tracing a line of energy that was now seeping out of him, glowing blue-white. He shuddered, whimpering again, biting his lip in an attempt to keep the noises in.

""Much better. Doesn't he look nice?"" Clu couldn't have possibly been talking to him, so... Rinzler. He was still here, somewhere, and he'd been watching the whole thing, and now he was seeing Axton as this complete wreck. For some reason that made him moan again, nearly drowning out the growl from the other side of the room. The programmer pulled away again, his heat dissipating slowly over a long moment of silence.

""Go ahead, Rinzler. He's yours."" Axton barely had time to register the words before his double was on him, flipping him over and kissing him breathless, pushing him into the bed and bringing all of their circuits into contact as quickly as possible. He clutched at anything he could reach - hair, skin, sheets - but his double was obviously in control, setting a quick and hard pace. Red and black filled his vision even as their combined circuits ran a spectrum of aroused colors, gold teasing at the edge of his vision telling him that Clu was still there and <i>close</i>.

It took barely a nanocycle before Axton's vision went blank and he shorted out, pleasure flooding every circuit, the feel of the programmer still inside him and his partner <i>everywhere</i> and it was all far too much for his newly-adjusted system. As soon as he reached climax he passed out, programming settling in around the edges of his consciousness, locking in.

He woke silently, assessing the situation without opening his eyes, only halfway aware of where he was. There was a gentle hand running through his hair, the soft surface beneath him vibrating softly with the sound humming through the air. He was in Rinzler's lap, it seemed.

""You seem very pleased, Rinzler."" Clu was still there as well. The humming increased; an affirmative answer. A deep chuckle from the programmer. ""Take him back to your quarters when he wakes. He needs more rest to let the programming fully sink in before we continue training."" Rinzler didn't answer but Axton assumed he nodded. More programming... more training. The programmer. Rinzler. Axton settled back into Rinzler's lap, not feeling like moving anywhere quite yet. 

Content, he decided. That was what he felt, right now. It was... nice.

He couldn't feel the last bits of his old memories lock themselves away, or the submissive command structure cementing itself, or the bit of simple Grid knowledge worming its way into his head. It didn't matter, anyways. It was already too late.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
""Axton."" He stirred, eyes bleary as he blinked them open. ""Drink."" A hand appeared with a glass of something, and he couldn't find it in himself to refuse it. It felt cool and soothing going down, a delicious, sweet blend, and he sighed contently. The world came into focus slowly, centered around the program sitting to the side of... not <i>his</i> bed, he remembered. Rinzler. The program hovering over him looked just this side of worried until the expression was swept away by his normal neutral one. ""Come. We must train.""

He struggled upwards, body resisting for a moment before the controls clicked back into place, rolling his shoulders once to stretch before scooting out of the bed. Rinzler looked rather amused and he wondered why - he was still new to this, after all, he couldn't be perfect like his partner. Partner? The confusion must have crossed his face as the other program was suddenly right beside him, eyes locked with his own. ""Axton."" He waved Rinzler off, stretching again before nodding. Training, right.

They wandered down halls and through elevators and he wondered the whole time how big the complex was. It occurred to him that he didn't even know where they were. How had he gotten here? But then Rinzler was tugging on his arm again and they were entering a rather nice private training room. The program guided him to the center and began interrogating him. No, he didn't know how to fly a lightjet. Or ride a lightcycle. Or pilot a recognizer. Or use a lightsword. Or a baton. No, not even a stave. Rinzler looked a little put out. He rolled his eyes - it certainly wasn't his fault he didn't know anything. It wasn't like you could be born with the knowledge. Could you?

""From the beginning, then."" He fell into a stance, of some sort, helmet sliding into place. ""Copy me."" Axton immediately did so, slightly surprised that he was able to follow so perfectly. Rinzler smiled. ""Good."" He drew his discs, splitting them easily and holding them in the same position. Axton copied, for some reason surprised when his disc split as well. Wasn't he just-- Rinzler moved, thrusting one disc out and then up in an uppercut move, following it with a sweep of his leg and ending in a dramatic pose. He felt himself moving, almost unconciously doing the same.

They continued in a similar fashion for a while, the moves becoming increasingly complex, Rinzler occasionally pausing to reach over and nudge him into a more correct position. It seemed to be going fine until Rinzler propelled himself up in a flip and Axton attempted it but fumbled and nearly decapitated himself with one of his own discs, helmet cracking and derezzing completely with the stress. Rinzler stopped immediately, rushing over, helmet retracting to run system scans as quickly as he could process while Axton just rolled over and arched, groaning, to crack his back. He chuckled, sitting up slowly. ""Seems like I'm just not as..."" He trails off, thoughts conflicting. They were supposed to be identical, so how could he be any less - Rinzler growled and he looked up, blinking.

""Technique. Here."" Rinzler guided him back to his feet, pushing and pulling him into the exact correct stance he needed to be in. He talked, murmured direction in his ear, hands running over the circuits he was speaking of. Eventually he stood back and Axton tried again, this time executing it smoothly, smiling over at his partner as he looked up. Rinzler beamed back at him, moving forward and gently guiding him into the next position. He couldn't help but notice the touch this time, of course, sliding over every circuit he had and reminding him of exactly what they'd been doing yesterday. Axton tried to focus, he did, but barely got through two more jumps before his circuits were flushing a deep violet and he was tired of keeping up the pretense of paying attention.

""Rinzler."" His double ceased talking, though his hands were still tracing distracting patterns over his circuits. He shuddered, once, trying to gather the words but unable to. Rinzler kissed his neck softly and Axton could feel the smile gracing those lips. ""Time to switch to our other training?"" He nodded, almost just turned and pinned him to the ground but his double was already guiding his discs back to their dock and his body out the door, purring deceptively in his ear. 

They somehow made it back to Rinzler's room before he pinned the program to the wall, kissing him thoroughly. Rinzler twirled a hand through his hair, tightening it suddenly and pulling his head back, biting along his exposed throat. ""Patience,"" he hissed, using his grip to slowly pull Axton off of him and shove him towards the bed. He stumbled, falling over it, landing heavily and getting only half a second to reorient before Rinzler was there on top of him, pinning him in place with knees and hands and an eager mouth.

Axton was moved bit by bit, every shift of a limb accompanied by a grind of hips and a deep kiss. By the time he'd been positioned how Rinzler wanted him - on his stomach, splayed across the bed - his circuits were pulsing with need. Every movement sent a ripple of red-purple light through his system, making him stifle groans in the sheets. Rinzler purred in his ear, unashamedly massaging his backside with a vigor Axton hadn't known existed before now.

""Just relax. I'll be gentle, but... the Programmer most likely won't."" Axton nodded, trying to let the tension flow out of his shoulders and thighs, failing miserably as his suit began to derezz and it was suddenly purely circuits to circuits. He cursed and twisted, trying to increase the contact, only dissuaded as it earned him a sharp, stinging slap to the same area. ""Stay still."" A whine escaped him before he could stop it, face burning as he buried it in the sheets. Rinzler stayed quiet for a moment before being seemingly satisfied and moving forward again, shifting on the bed and--

Axton moaned, surprised, muscles clenching with the effort to stay still as Rinzler licked at his entrance. He felt a smirk find its way across that face before he buried himself further, assaulting him with a barrage of wet pleasure. It was almost enough to get him off but just barely not and he groaned, trying to push back or forward - <i>anything</i> to get that last edge of friction. Rinzler held his hips still with an iron grip, swatting him lightly on the ass again. Apparently that was enough of a cue, however, as he pulled back and <i>fuck</i> Axton could hear the wet smack as he pulled himself off and licked his lips, purr loud and content. His double was sliding back up, his own excitement evident, purring low in his ear and then there were two bare fingers slotting deep and full into him and Axton couldn't see anymore.

Rinzler chuckled, low and rough with desire, spreading him quickly but thoroughly, done with the teasing and almost as eager as Axton himself. There was a brief pause as his fingers withdrew and then they both moaned in unison, voices blending together as their bodies became one. Rinzler pushed until he was fully seated inside him and Axton was reduced to a panting, purple heap of a program, circuits flickering brightly. He couldn't think, couldn't speak, could only gasp out what he hoped were words while his body pushed back, demanding more. Rinzler obeyed, thrusting sharply, and his world went bright, overload flooding his system with heat and pleasure.

His high faded slowly and Rinzler was still there, still inside him, pulsing and insistent and <i>hot</i>, purring and laying gentle kisses along his shoulder. He shuddered and moaned weakly, knowing they were not done, unable to stop the clench of his body as Rinzler began moving again. His double growled, thrusts shallow and quick, making Axton grit his teeth while he bore the onslaught of pleasure on his too-sensitive circuits. The other moaned deeply, sinking his teeth into Axton's shoulder as his hips stuttered and he was suddenly filled with heat.

They stayed still for a long minute, panting as their circuits cooled. Rinzler rumbled softly, laying light kisses against the wound he'd only half meant to make, hands running soothingly against Axton's sides. It felt all too pleasant and Axton felt as if he were missing something, suddenly, so full of warmth and purpose but still lacking something vital and core. He pulled away, falling forward and shifting onto his back, trying to even out the rhythm of his breath while he watched his double do the same. He was suddenly fascinated - it seemed that Rinzler <i>did</i> have the same circuits he wore proudly hidden beneath his dark suit, the same intricate patterns traced lightly over his skin. A curious hand traced over the squares at his throat, across the lines of his shoulder, and Rinzler smiled down at him. They kissed again, soft and sweet, and Axton pushed whatever it was out of his thoughts. It could be dealt with later, some time when he wasn't too busy enjoying the comfort of another curled up with him.

Rinzler was happy to note that Axton's circuits returned to red, not white, even if the user-program himself did not notice. Their methods were working far better than expected. It was only a matter of time before he was theirs, <i>completely</i>. 

He resolutely ignored the thrill that thought sent through his circuits.

<b>Author's Notes:</b> sequel to <a href=""http://ekala-sy-eph.livejournal.com/58844.html#cutid1"">the taste of defeat</a> and the second part of an ever-expanding reprogrammed!Alan!verse that refuses to leave my head. and for after you read: yes, I gave Alan classic!Tron circuits on a Legacy suit.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
They kept him in this nice, luxurious room. He wasn't allowed to leave, of course, but the bed was soft and he couldn't remember a time when he wanted anything more than to eat and sleep and play with the intriguing bits of code Rinzler would give him when he visited.  He had also gotten one of those awesome gridsuits they'd all been wearing. It was almost like spandex or leather except it was comfortable and it breathed and moved and Alan almost wished he were more athletic so he could exploit it. He spent hours examining it, wondering what the material really was and if it translated out into the real world; they could make millions selling motorcycle suits or wetsuits or pretty much anything made out of that material. And the circuits were breathtaking. He seemed to have about ten times as many as anyone else he'd seen - broad swathes across his back, crazy patterns down his arms and legs, all looking more or less exactly like any stock picture of computer circuitry. They were also currently a bright white - god knew why, as everything else he had seen recently has those orange-red ones, besides Clu himself. 

Even just the thought of the Programmer sent a pulse of light across his circuits and Alan bit his lip, shuddering. He felt like he was 16 again - almost constantly horny. It didn't even occur to him that it might be the fault of the collar still encircling his neck. Thankfully it wasn't totally distracting, though, and he mostly just avoided thinking about it much. For a couple of days he was left alone almost completely. It felt more like vacation than anything else; a fuzzy inbetween of relaxation, thoughts swimming with wonder.

Rinzler finally came for him. Alan knew it was different from the moment the program walked in for one simple reason: he was holding the lightrope. He wasted no time in acquiesing, tilting his head back and shivering lightly as the program's fingers brushed under his chin affectionately before securing the leash. Alan followed him as he led him out, staying close enough so that the rope stayed slack, wide eyes absorbing what he could of around him. They still seemed to be in the ship he'd originally been on - so they hadn't moved him out of the place after he'd blacked out. That was... reassuring, somehow.

However, instead of heading towards what seemed to be the main room, Rinzler dragged him off into a side room. It actually seemed modestly decorated compared to everything else Alan had seen; red-orange lines danced in intricate patterns on the wall, black furniture scattered about, one wall half-transparent. The warrior's bedroom, he would assume. His private study. It was rather beautiful but he had no idea why he would--

Rinzler crowded him back against the door, helmet disappearing as he pressed in closer for a kiss. Well, that had been one option, he supposed. Those red eyes were no less enchanting now than they had been before and he couldn't help but stare as his twin pulled away, licking his lips and looking most definitely like the cat who had gotten both the cream and the canary.

""I am to teach you."" Alan nodded distantly, the taste of what he'd learned to call simply energy lingering in his mouth. Rinzler tugged gently on his leash, his attention suddenly focusing directly back on his twin's face. ""Your name is Axton."" Alan opened his mouth to protest but was cut off by another tug and a stare he knew meant disapproval. ""Your name,"" he repeated slowly, ""is Axton. You serve the Programmer and Master, Clu. You take orders only from him. You will do anything for him.""

It didn't feel much like teaching, but Alan found himself listening intently nonetheless. He had been wondering what their purpose in keeping him was; apparently they wished to turn him into a drone like every other program around here. It wasn't going to work, of course; he was human, not a program, and simply trying to rewrite his 'code' wouldn't work. ""You are also my partner. My other half. We fight together."" Rinzler leaned forward, nearly touching their lips together, disturbing Alan's calm and causing him to nearly short-circuit as gentle fingers ran along the edge of his disc. ""Together we are whole and we will accomplish anything our Programmer tells us to do.""

By this time Alan's concentration had been fully disrupted, completely focused on the entirely pleasurable feeling that was gloved fingers running along the edge of his disc, slipping up before running down over the face of the disc and pressing lightly on the center ring. He moaned loudly, shaking, hands suddenly flying up to clutch at his twin's shoulders. The smirk it drew out of Rinzler was felt more than seen and they were pressing together again, blissfully amazing, circuits rubbing against circuits. Alan swore as the program drew back, breaking all contact, whispering to him again.

""Today I am to teach you how to please our Programmer. You have learned how to manipulate his circuits already."" The user was only half-listening, nodding distractedly. Anything to get that feeling back again. ""I must teach you how to accept him into you."" The words had just registered as Rinzler's hands slammed down on his shoulders, forcing Alan neatly onto his knees, grunting as the shock reverberated through his body. One gentle hand was back again, tilting his head up and tapping under his chin until he looked up, eyes locking with his double's again, blue meeting red.

Rinzler's thumb pressed against his lips and he sucked it in without hesitation, tongue lapping at the dark material. He realized belatedly what he was doing, what Rinzler was going to teach him to do, and he looked down, face flushing to a bright red. What <i>was</i> he doing here and why wasn't he struggling-- a tug on the leash interrupted his thoughts just as Rinzler's thumb retreated. He started to look back up but the process was thoroughly interrupted by one of the program's hands sliding in front of his face - no, over the front of his uniform, letting it fall away and --

Alan wondered vaguely if he looked this good from this position. He doubted it. God, he couldn't help the thought that stuck in his mind; that he was going to have it in his mouth and it would taste just as good as the traces that he'd managed to catch of their Programmer before. It made him salivate and he would bet that Rinzler looked rather smug as one hand tangled in his hair, guiding him forward and pressing his lips just against the tip of his cock. He could taste the heat from here and it was so tempting but his lips were sealed shut with fear and rebellion and something he just can't quite place. The other's free hand brushed gently over his eyes, urging him to close them, words floating to him although he honestly wasn't sure if they had been spoken or just in his head.

""Stop resisting."" His jaw went slack and Rinzler pushed inside, hot and thick and heavy and Alan completely forgot why he was resisting in the first place. It felt so <i>right</i> and he moaned, sucking once without meaning to and far too thoroughly enjoying the tiny thrust of his double's hips that it caused. Rinzler guided him up and down, carefully setting the rhythm and pace, gentle and slow, murmuring instructions that Alan could only follow. A twist of the tongue here, a suck as he did this, don't forget to-- right <i>there</i>.

It was all fine until the thrusts got deeper. Alan tried to relax, but he couldn't help his gag reflex and pushed desperately against Rinzler's legs, gasping and coughing as the other let him pull off. Fuck, that had hurt, but he knew he had to learn, somehow. Rinzler let him breathe for a moment before making him tilt his head up and look at him. He ran a soothing hand down the length of Alan's throat, smiling a bit, before speaking. ""Flatten your tongue. Keep breathing. Think about how good it would feel to have him all the way..."" Alan swallowed, breath going shallow suddenly. Yeah, that was something he definitely wanted. Rinzler had looked so good doing it before, if he could just...

The program was pulling him back again, pushing into him and sliding smoothly to the back of his mouth, and Alan squeezed his eyes shut and tried to relax again, following the tips as best he could. Rinzler moaned and he <i>swallowed</i> and suddenly his nose was pressed to his double's stomach, tears forming at the corners of his eyes. That moan turned into a strained, long, pleasured noise and he felt it pulse inside him, pouring down his throat, and he just swallowed and breathed and swallowed and breathed.

Then they were separated again, Alan falling to all fours and gasping and letting the rest of whatever was in his mouth drip down his chin and onto the floor, unable to stop it. They stayed like that for some indeterminate amount of time before Rinzler knelt in front of him, lifting his chin and wiping the mess from his face, smiling softly. Something in his eyes told Alan that he'd done more than well and he smiled back, blinking the remaining tears out of his blurry eyes.

""Very good, Axton."" Was that his name? It sounded a bit off, but-- Rinzler was helping him up, leading him over to the bed. ""You must also learn the other side but..."" He collapsed on the soft surface, feeling more exhausted than he realized. Rinzler appeared in his view, that soft smile still spread over his face. ""We will reconvene later. Rest, now, Axton. Dream of the Programmer.""

The last thing he saw were his own eyes, mirrored back to him in red.

His circuits flickered purple, disc glowing crimson for a nano before flipping back to white.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
It had all happened so fast, Alan wasn't sure quite what exactly had transpired. Flynn had told him that if he ever went missing he should open this sealed envelope and follow the instructions. The game, the secret room, the laser - the <i>digital world</i>, he thought, incredibly structured and organized and simply <i>beautiful</i>.

And, like any other unknown, extremely dangerous.

He'd been caught almost immediately after he came out of the arcade, carried off in this machinery marvel - a Recognizer, he knew, but how did that thing <i>fly</i> - and taken away to what looked like an arena. One of the guard programs began scanning the others, saying something but as it came to him it stopped, scanning him two or three times without what seemed like any success.

The minutes stretched on, the program continually scanning him without saying a word, the other programs in the line of what appeared to be prisoners as confused as he was, though a couple seemed rather grateful for the interruption. Eventually a lightcycle - now <i>that</i> was a lightcycle, most certainly, and damn that was amazing - rolled up, with what was apparently a superior. He did something to the program in front of Alan and he stepped away, leaving only the fairly intimidating helmeted program there.

He does the same motion: the small helmet tilt, the flicker of pure programming. However, unlike the other, he does it only twice before releasing the foot restraints and pulling Alan along, rumbling vibrating down his arm. Sounded like a broken harddrive, he realized, and that was all he could think before he was shoved over the back of the bike and they were speeding off somewhere.

It was <i>exhilarating</i>, the rush of nearly-static air, the perfect bike purring between his legs, the glow that everything including his supposed captor gave off. If this was where Flynn had been disappearing to - and of course it was. The digital frontier. He laughed. Of course he'd be excited over this.

But that didn't last long.

Now he's on the floor, a boot heavy on his back, able to tilt his head up just enough to look at what was most definitely an evil Kevin doppelganger (even if he lacked the goatee). It was fairly simple to assume that this was where he'd gone to - somehow this madman had him trapped in the system, or something. Alan was suddenly glad that he'd left the letter out on his table - certainly someone would find it. As long as that didn't disappear, eventually someone would figure this out.

He didn't want to think of what would happen if they turned off the computer. Avoiding that, he grit his teeth, still putting up as much of a fight as he was able. Granted, it wasn't much - he wasn't sure if the programs had super-human strength or simply a lot more than him, but he couldn't even push up enough to get his chest off the ground. Still, he's tense and obviously unwilling even as the clone kneels in front of him, tracing over the lines of his face.

""You're just as beautiful... and so much less compliant. Let's see if we can change that, shall we?"" Alan growled, silenced only by a warning grind against his spine, as the program walked over to some unseen compartment and brought back what could only be a collar, complete with what he definitely did not just call a lightrope in his head. And yes, he did snap it around his neck, and he definitely did not like the feeling and he could not be wondering if Kevin had at least vaguely similar fantasies. Evil he may be, but this thing was definitely still a clone. He wasn't sure he liked the way that sent a flush through his body.

""Rinzler."" That must have been the other program's name, as the boot on his back lifted, replaced by hands like iron shackles around his arms, dragging him over to where evil-doppelganger was now sitting on what was halfway a couch and halfway a throne, bowing respectfully as he handed over the light--- the <i>leash</i>, damnit, it's not like it made any difference. The program smirked, tugging lightly on it, chuckling as Alan pulled back and nearly strangled himself in the process. Anything was better than just giving up.

""Nearly as resiliant as him, too. Well, we all must start somewhere. And today... I believe my boots need a good cleaning."" Alan couldn't believe his ears. Collared and leashed and now he--- he knew where this was going. He'd heard tales of places in the ""real"" world, as it were. Places where people were treated like pets, like slaves, whipped and beaten and... He really didn't want to consider the possiblity, even if it made everything they'd done make far more sense in addition to making his suit just a tad tighter than it'd been before.

""I'm not going to do anything like that, you... degenerate <i>freak</i>!"" He pulled back again, ready for the choke this time, spitting as best he could towards the clone. The doppleganger just laughed, holding the leash firm until Alan has to relent and lean forward again, gasping lightly against the program's boots.

""Rinzler."" Alan barely had time to widen his eyes before there's a boot between his shoulders again, grinding against his spine, an iron grip twisting one of his arms up and behind him in a painful hold. He's close enough to smell his captor's boot now, the gold of his circuits dizzying from this distance, and it would have been a beautiful color originally, he thinks. Vaguely he wondered if Kevin chose it, but decides that regardless of who chose it it would have been Kevin's choice, even if he can't reconcile this monstrosity with his best friend.

It doesn't even occur to him that he shouldn't. That maybe they're different people altogether. He knows Kevin well enough that if he was going to put something into a system like this that looked this much like him, he'd make it act like him, but that certainly wasn't explaining why Alan was half an inch from a dictator's boot with a guard threatening to break his arm if he didn't clean it until it shone with nothing more than his tongue.

Maybe it was the collar, or the pain, or just the fact that he's completely overwhelmed by everything, but it suddenly didn't seem like such a bad thing. He groaned lightly in frustration before finally flicking his tongue out and swiping it over the broad surface, gasping lightly as Rinzler let his arm go immediately. The pressure on his back lifted but stayed, a threat to continue. Kevin's clone just watched him and he screwed his eyes shut, trying not to think too much about what he looks like, sprawled on all fours and licking at his master's boot.

To take his mind off the image, along with the persistent pressure of Rinzler's boot and that damned collar, he focused on the job. The boot doesn't actually taste dirty - he's fairly sure there's not any dirt here, in the digital world, but it doesn't make this any less degrading. For a few good moments he thought of what it must be made of; some sort of plastic, he supposes, smooth under his tongue, interrupted only by those increasingly intriguing light-lines. Circuits, he thought, as he passes over one and the taste of electricity fills his mouth, sharp and bitter like he'd licked a battery.

The room is silent as he continued, the low hum coming from Rinzler just faded into background noise. It unnerved him, disquieted in a way not even learning of evil clones can accomplish. He could still hear himself; the steady yet fearful thudding of his heart, blood rushing through his ears, and just the tiniest wet noises as he moved and licked. His tongue lapped a broad stripe up one of those apparent circuits and the silence was suddenly, completely broken by a low moan. Alan looked up, alarmed, and upon catching the blissed look on not-Kevin's face it all came together.

The circuits must have been directly connected to whatever they designated as nerves. Like giant, glowing weak spots on the outside of their clothing. It only halfway made sense but it had to be it, because he was fairly sure just simple bootlicking wouldn't-- He caught himself staring at the man's crotch, his arousal completely evident, and it sent another wave of flushed heat through him that he passed off as embarrassment. His eyes flicked back up to the program's face and he's met with a lustful look that turns into smug heat as he feels his face turn red. Alan felt as if he were falling already, losing himself to this dark fantasy that he couldn't even admit he wanted. It couldn't be real but it was and the desire to get away was dwindling quickly.

Then his focus shifted and Alan tried to look with him, disoriented. ""Rinzler. Kiss me."" The pressure suddenly lifted from Alan's back and he sat up just a bit, shifting and cracking his shoulders, eyes glancing between the two programs. Rinzler crawled into the other's lap, helmet retracting as he leaned forward and Alan sat there awkwardly, watching the back of his head and hearing nothing but the wet slide of their lips together for a long moment. They moved and he heard the other chuckle before uttering another command. ""Show him your face, pet."" The warrior program turned obediently, and--

His breath caught in his throat, blood turning to ice inside him. The program had another familiar face - his <i>own</i>. No wonder Kevin's clone had seemed so smug. God, no, he couldn't even - he felt himself trying to form words and failing, scrambling over and pressing his back to the side of the chair, trying to meld himself into it as if that would calm him. The leash is tight but not choking, though it didn't help the frantic breaths he was gasping in, lungs burning with the effort. He hadn't suffered a panic attack before but this sure as hell felt like one, mind spinning and unable to focus on one thing, body trembling with something he couldn't even name.

He's suddenly being held by strong arms, just able to tell from the red circuits that this must be his twin - his very own <i>evil doppleganger</i> - and he's shaking and probably crying, clinging to this warm, solid mass, not quite able to listen to the comforting words he was murmuring in his ear. He calmed, slowly, the hand petting through his hair and the hot lips whispering to him between light kisses along his neck and it felt so good, as everything came back into sharp, sharp focus.

""...he won't ever betray you or hurt you, he will comfort you in every way, he'll love you and train you and make you <i>perfect</i> and together we can be everything, to the system, to him, if you'll only just...""

Alan barely registered his own motions as he pulled Rinzler into a kiss, moaning into his mouth as a surge of power passed through him. Everything felt so much different here even as it was the same, hot pleasure mixed with crackling electricity and simple touches enhanced to waves of heated bliss. They broke apart quickly, the user's chest still heaving for breath, unsure what he was doing or what he should be doing or even why-- but his twin, with those all-too-enchanting red eyes, smiled softly and laid a line of light kisses along his bottom lip, whispering praises.

""Together we'll be whole.""

The tug on the collar was not as unexpected as he thought, and he automatically moved towards it now, eyes shifting back to his master. The program was stroking himself now, black and gold contrasting with the pale sheen of his body and Alan felt his own suit move uncomfortably tight against him again, making him shudder. He suddenly, clearly understood the unspoken command and stooped low and ran his tongue along the long, glowing circuit again, feeling more than seeing it brighten and waver under his touch. It was just all too much and he couldn't do anything but follow these orders, do what he was told, or else he might overload himself.

Rinzler watched him for a long moment - he could feel both pairs of eyes as they shifted away from him to each other, the warrior slinking back to his master, settling beside Alan. The drawn-out moan made him look up, shivering at the sight of himself, Rinzler, it barely mattered - of them sucking the program's dick, cheeks hollow and already letting him move deep. He groaned himself, again, returning to his own job, trying not to be outdone. The master couldn't last long under such an assault and Alan shook as Rinzler touched a leg to his side, almost as if a circuit was completed, energy running through all three of them.

The gold-circuited program moaned again, long and hard and Alan could feel the rush of energy through him as surely as he could taste it from the circuit his mouth was pressed against and he <i>knew</i>. He glanced up just in time to see the master bury hands in Rinzler's hair and arch up into his mouth, releasing himself, circuits bursting with light and pleasure. Rinzler took it gracefully, obviously in practice, drawing back slowly and keeping his mouth shut as he looked to Alan again, eyes darker than Alan could ever remember his own being. He could lose himself in those.

Perhaps he did, as the next thing he could recall was Rinzler pressing him against the chair, right there between their programmer's legs, kissing him deeply and sharing that intoxicating taste with him. He knew semen was supposed to taste bitter, or disgusting, or <i>something</i>, but he couldn't get enough of the taste and grasped at the program's arms, trying to pull him closer as they chased every bit of the master's energy down the other's throat. They pulled apart momentarily, Alan's chest heaving again, face flushed - no, his entire body felt flushed, waiting for another touch or another pull or anything from either of the programs.

At some unknown signal - probably from the other clone, as he can still feel his eyes on the back of his neck and the residual warmth of his circuits surrounding them both - Rinzler pushed forward again, this time with his whole body, rolling against Alan in what he could only describe as the most pleasurable lapdance imaginable. It was if the warm tingly feelings he got when he finished a particularly hard program rushed to every single atom in his body, combined with the intense pleasure of what felt like orgasm but couldn't be because he still wanted <i>more</i>, Rinzler rolling down again and again and he was sure he was screaming or dying or perhaps just moaning pathetically. His own circuits burst outward in a wave of white light, drowning his senses in electric bliss for a long minute of eternity.

The gentle hand petting through his hair grounded him first, giving him a single point of contact to focus on, to let himself realign and reorient. His double's purr was persistent in his ear and he opened his eyes to find the program still sprawled over him, glowing what he supposed was a happy maroon. There was a tiny tug at his collar and he rolled his head back, looking at the programmer, a shudder running through him at the lazy, smug contentment written all over not-Kevin's face.

""You did very well. We'll train you and you'll stay with us. You'll like that, won't you?"" Alan felt himself nod tiredly, and he supposed he really didn't mind much. If pleasure like that was involved... even if it was with a clone of himself and his best friend... well, he supposed he was rather handsome, and he'd always harbored a sort of secret crush on Kevin. It certainly wasn't the worst situation. He could be dead or injured and instead he was floating on the cloud of the afterglow of what he could easily classify as the best orgasm of his entire life.

Besides, eventually <i>someone</i> would find that letter, and they'd rescue Kevin and he both, and maybe he could convince Rinzler and his programmer that the outside world wasn't that terrible and they could come with him. He was sure Kevin wouldn't mind the idea of a little foursome. In the meantime he'd just follow orders and do as he was told - something Alan had always been good at.

Of course, what he didn't know was that Lora had found the letter as well, and seeing the Encom header and assuming it was some piece of work he'd need, had tucked it in the pocket of his jacket to make sure he wouldn't leave it. Alan was always forgetting papers at home and she did her best to correct that when she could.

He just always left the important things behind. Turning more into Kevin every day, she thought.

The last thing he remembers is flying.

Falling, he amends, tossed aside as he returned to his primary programming, knocked down and the last thing he could remember was falling towards that deep abyss they called the Sea of Simulation.

He awakes to a soft, blurry blue and an all-encompassing warmth. Dimly he realizes the light is his own, diffused through the energy-not-energy of the Sea. Blue, he thinks. Fortunately, it seems the ISO virus released there has no effect on his Basic systems.

For a while there is just <i>being</i>. His systems cannot even begin to handle the strain of processing the last thousand cycles. He can barely contemplate even moving.

Eventually his circuits register something beside himself floating in the energy pool. It's large, he notices, cautiously flowing around him and examining the program in its territory. He'd never known there were such creatures in the Sea but he can't be surprised, given what had come out of it before.

It wraps around him, gentle and warm and covered in bright, white circuitry that nearly blinded him as one of its appendages wrapped around his still-present helmet. He made a soft noise of protest, fingers twitching, but the touch continues, firmly encasing wrists and legs and waist. The feeling he gets is that he should relax - distantly, he thinks that maybe this is an ISO, a mutation of some sort that can communicate through his circuits as another feeling washes over him; trust and giving and total, complete relaxation. He is more relaxed than he thinks he'd ever been, even before...

Some of the appendages hold him steady, still above whatever creature this was. Others roamed, sucking gently at his exposed circuits and brushing over sensitive code. It felt good, letting his processors work on something that required no memory, no thought, just a physical, purely programmed response to outside stimuli. That response, of course, was also pleasurable, and his circuits glowed with every tiny touch.

The creature began pouring energy into him, making him feel something between having life breathed back into him and pure, undiluted pleasure running through his system. Lights danced before his eyes and over his suit, making him open his mouth in a silent scream as his body tensed again, convulsing suddenly against the grip around every part of him.

His systems took time to reboot again, but it was in the arms of the other program that he once again became aware of his surroundings. He'd been stripped, bare circuitry glowing brightly as the current of the Sea swept the half-tainted energy around him. Those white appendages were still wrapped around him, stroking him slowly and softly. He shuddered, most of his systems now recharged and active including his movement processes. 

It was everywhere, as normal as the thick dark that surrounded them both. Holding him open, touching every open circuit, covering him in a blanket of white around his newly-regained blue. Inside him, too, making him writhe in pleasure he hadn't even known existed. He moved with it, moaning silently and feeling the dark energy-light energy-ISO-thick-warm-<i>good</i> fill him everywhere, overloading not only his circuits but his senses, his feelings, his <i>being</i>.

Another reboot. It was still there, but it had ceased to touch him save for one gentle appendage along his cheek. He felt a surge of gratitude, supposedly from the creature. He shook his head, brushing his own fingers along the limb. Knowing he could not speak, he simply tried to radiate his deep gratitude back to it. It had given him the boost he needed to restart completely. He could rebuild the Grid; he could do something <i>right</i>, finally.

It was many cycles before he returned to the Sea, but still a distant flash of white greeted him.

<b>Title:</b> Possession
<b>Rating:</b> NC-17
<b>Warnings:</b> non/dub-con, cussing everywhere, terrible sentence structure, no plot
<b>Word Count:</b> ~1500
<b>Summary:</b> <i>If there was one thing that got Ed hard, it was being dominated.</i>
<b>Author's Notes:</b> for <lj user=""yanagoya""> for being awesome and donating to <lj user=""help_japan"">. also just being awesome in general. &hearts; this thing is huge and rambly and I apologize in advance to all Junior fans out there, because this is apparently what he sounds like in my head, and it's not exactly flattering.
<font size=""1"">HOPE THE RAPE SOUNDS GOOD TOO, HERP. It's a bit more non-con-y than I normally write and I feel kind of skeevy for it, but hopefully it sounds alright/flows well/whatever. /end rambling</font>

<font size=1><strike>EDIT: HAHAHAHA I also just realized it kind of sounds like somehow Ed's getting raped by his own program at the end there, because he doesn't know Rinzler's name and I don't use it at all. but uh, it was just in the possessive sense, not in the 'you made me' sense. HERP.</font></strike>


<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
He had no idea how he got here.

Well not <i>here</i> as in inside the computer. That was obvious enough - the giant laser that had zapped in here when he was poking away at some things. But <i>here</i>, as in with his hands tied to a headboard with rope lights and his legs spread wide and his ass in the air and his glasses being plucked off his face by this crazy cat-warrior who had earlier done the same curious routine with each piece of his clothing.

""Give them back, you fucking cat!"" The other still hadn't talked - Ed wasn't sure he <i>could</i> - and seemed to disregard him altogether, bending the glasses and jumping when they broke with a definitive snap. Ed growled, giving up and burying his head in the (surprisingly comfortable) pillow again. His life sucked.

""Fucking thing and your fucking stupid curiosity and fuck those were vintage and cost me a shitload, you better be ready to pay me back, if you even have currency here, I don't fucking know -- FUCK!"" His muttering was cut off by a hand wandering down his back and he turned his head back, attempting to see the program or whatever it was. ""What the fuck are you doing now, you overgrown house cat!?""

He didn't have time to react, couldn't see him as the program fisted a hand in his hair and pushed his head forcefully back into the pillow. The growl was suddenly right next to his ear and he could feel the skin on his back prickle as what felt like a field of static got indeterminably close to it. Junior could barely breathe, the pillow stifling him, scalp aching from the sudden abuse.

The warrior moved back as quickly as he had moved forward but he could still feel him, kneeling behind him on the bed. <i>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, <b>fuck</b></i>. He was so screwed and he was pretty sure he meant that in a literal way. Unfortunately he didn't really like men and he <i>certainly</i> didn't like this particular quote-unquote ""man"" and he still couldn't stifle the gasp that came when a gloved hand came down hard across his vulnerable ass.

If there was one thing that got Ed hard, it was being dominated. He realized belatedly that this was basically his biggest fantasy coming true, although he'd much rather the guy be a <i>girl</i> (with a strapon, though, that was the best part) and not in a fucking <i>computer</i> how did that make any sense - but then Rinzler slapped him again and his thoughts trailed off with another moan. Fuck, no, he didn't want this but he <i>totally did</i> and there were suddenly two fingers pushing into his mouth and he sucked on them for half a second before biting down hard, earning him another hard slap and a deep growl. He hung on regardless, biting hard but unable to get through the thick plastic-latex-leather-whatever gloves.

The program ripped his fingers out, his other hand grabbing the back of Ed's neck and pushing him forcefully against the bed again, half-choking him but leaving him plenty of room to breathe this time, head wrenched to the side. He should have been ready for the fingers plunging into him but he wasn't at all and it hurt like a bitch, and <i>fuck</i> he should have just cooperated and sucked the damn things. He grit his teeth, trying to breathe and relax and make this not as terrible as it could be but those fingers were unrelenting in their stretching, sinking into him over and over as they moved and scissored and fuck fuck <i>fuck</i> he felt like dying of pain and shame and it hurt <i>so good</i>.

Damn the entire world and every computer in it to all hell. He was hard as fuck and the thing wasn't stopping anytime soon, pressing further and deeper and <i>fuck</i> he moaned and clutched at the restraints around his wrists, knees dropping and spreading him apart more than he meant to. Without any warning those fingers were gone and there was a huge, <i>dry</i> thing there in its place and the program was going to tear his ass to shreds. His cock twitched at the thought and he wondered again what fucked up the wiring in his brain so much that he found that so damn arousing.

The push was slow, <i>damn</i> slow and it burned every millimeter of the way, his body rejecting it on one end as it rejoiced on the other. He could feel himself shaking, wondering when he'd gotten so weak, just before the hand on the back of his neck let up and instead ran down his back. It felt like the guy had suddenly grown claws, sharp and cutting and he arched into the touch, biting his lip to stifle another moan. An effective diversion, he realized, as the rest of the guy's cock slid into his ass and he felt hips nestled against his own. Then there were teeth on his neck, hard and unrelenting like the rest of him, and he could only wonder when he'd lost the helmet.

Then he started <i>moving</i> again and goddamn he felt the first tears slip down his cheeks because it fucking <i>hurt</i>, goddamnit. But fuck it all if he couldn't resist whining and pushing himself back, hips automatically attempting to match the movements as the program sped. It was obvious now that the warrior cared little for his pleasure or noise or whatever as he drew back, fingers digging sharply into his hips as he angled <i>deep</i> and the pain-pleasure was driving him fucking crazy.

It felt like the program fucked him for days, his arms and legs aching from the strain of keeping him up, voice long since hoarse from moaning, hips inevitably bruised, ass burning from the repeated abuse. Now and then he'd move a hand from his hips and rake it down his back, creating what Ed was sure was a lovely pattern of scratches, or lean down and thrust long and slow for a while as he panted hot air against his neck and sucked marks into his skin.

Finally, <i>finally</i>, except not at all because Ed was half-crazy with lust and almost wished this could continue forever, the program began <i>really</i> fucking him, grunting and thrusting far and deep and <i>yes</i>. Ed moaned and stretched and shifted back, wanting that except <i>more</i>, always more, and the program complied completely, so thick and hard and perfect inside of him suddenly, the burn of lingering pain perfectly complimenting the intense pleasure. He's almost disappointed when the program groans lowly and empties himself inside him, but then it's <i>hot</i>, so hot, hotter than anything he's ever felt and maybe that was a program quirk but fuck it's spilling inside of him and he wants nothing but <i>more</i> for a very long moment.

The program collapsed on top of him, utterly uncaring, and Ed whined as his arms are pulled to an odd angle. He remembered suddenly that he hurt everywhere and it's terrible and wonderful and he just wanted to get out of here and go home and jack off to this forever and have it never happen again. The thing started to move again and he tensed, hoping to God it wasn't going to continue (but it was still inside him, even if it was softening rapidly) and he moaned when a gloved hand slid down his side and grasped his erection that was just begging for attention. It twitched in his captor's hand and he wanted to die of shame, but <i>fuck</i> it felt so damn good to be touched at all after that.

It's too gentle and too slow and he wanted more, faster, harder, something, but his body disagrees and he's shaking and moaning and pushing weakly into that fist as it slides up and down his shaft. Within moments - far too fast - he's gone, body shuddering with pleasure as he cums. Terrible and anticlimatic and fuck, why couldn't he have just touched him before, but then the guy is shifting again and licking his cum off those damn fingers and he felt his cock give a twitch of approval even in his wasted state.

He's more than surprised when the program finally pulls out - fuck, fuck, <i>fuck</i> he's going to hurt for days, weeks and doesn't know how he's going to focus at meetings - and begins untying him. His surprise didn't stop him from swinging at the helmeted madman, in a desperate attempt to get the hell out of there again, but the guy catches his wrist easily and twists it down beside them both, growling sharply.

""User,"" he rumbled, and apparently he can talk. Ed gasped as his arm was twisted further, the program leaning in and getting that helmet damn close to his face before the rest of it folded away completely. He gaped. He stared. It couldn't be true.

""<i>My</i> user.""

<b>Title:</b> Red Bliss
<b>Rating:</b> R
<b>Warnings:</b> bloodkink, violence.
<b>Word Count:</b> ~1100
<b>Summary:</b> <i>The opposite of the pure, clean, sweet energy that flowed through pools - hot and filthy and absolutely delectable.</i>
<b>Author's Notes:</b> written for a prompt on the <lj user=""tronkinkmeme"">.

<lj-cut text=""fic here"">
Tron had gotten his first taste a very long time ago.

Flynn had cut himself on something - Tron couldn't remember what anymore, it had hardly mattered - and he'd muttered and cursed for a bit. Tron simply did what seemed logical. When programs were injured they leaked energy and it was simple enough to reabsorb it. Flynn didn't seem to understand the concept so Tron grasped his wrist and sucked his finger into his mouth.

<i>Bliss</i>.

It was like receiving an input from an I/O tower directly into his system, warm and fresh and pulsing through his circuits, though it ended far too quickly for his liking. Flynn looked a bit embarrassed as he pulled his finger away, thanking Tron distantly.

It was all he could do to keep from requesting more. For cycles afterwards he would look at Flynn and a ghost of that feeling would pass through him and he <i>wanted</i> so badly but he could not purposefully hurt any User. It would not be right.

He waited.

---

Red. That smell. <i>Blood.</i>

<i><b>User.</i></b>

---

Hundreds of cycles passed. Over a thousand, now. Clu's reign had come and gone and now it was again he and Flynn, rebuilding the Grid. This Flynn was simply a little newer and a little less vague.

And also, he thought, a little more reckless.

Sam hadn't yet gotten hurt in-Grid; too careful for that, too many things that could go wrong. But Tron could <i>smell</i> the bruises he came in with, the scrapes and the <i>blood</i> that rushed thick and hot under his skin. It blurred his senses when the User would get too close, motioning at a data screen or pointing something out, and he could do nothing but want quietly.

So again he waited. For his own mistake, for Sam's, for someone else's - for something to happen and for the User to <i>bleed</i>.

---

He'd never thought of trying this.

There had been a gridbug swarm - one far too large for him to take on by himself, but he did so anyways, holding them off while backup arrived. One caught the tail end of his lightcycle and he went flying, reflexes catching him in a roll but still injuring his code in a massively spectacular manner. The bugs were on him in nanocycles, gnawing at the edges of his ragged code and tearing him to pieces faster than he'd imagined.

They all disappeared in a flash of white light just as he felt his circuits begin to stutter. He managed to open his eyes to find a worried Flynn, fussing over him, trying to figure out how to patch such massive damage before he derezzed completely, and --

Tron felt himself moving on pure instinct, <i>felt</i> his circuits flicker red momentarily as he lunged up and sunk his teeth into Sam's neck. The User fell heavily to the ground and was saying something but Tron couldn't hear it over the rush of white static in his sensors, flowing into him like a tidal wave as Sam's blood filled his mouth.

It was iron and salt, the dirtiest liquid ever present on the Grid. The opposite of the pure, clean, sweet energy that flowed through pools - hot and filthy and absolutely delectable. Tron felt as if he were drinking from the fountain of life itself, the source spring of all energy on the Grid, coating his mouth in its thick, pungent taste. He heard himself moan, felt Sam clutch at his shoulders, echoing the noise.

He pulled away after a few moments, unable to even see straight from the pleasure-high still flooding his system. He swallowed again, heavily, trying to focus on the User beneath him. Sam looked stunned, one hand clutched over the still-bleeding wound, but he was breathing heavily and Tron knew the look of excitement even on a User. He realized belatedly that his own circuits were a violent purple, his own arousal rubbing painfully against his suit.

Sam mouthed something, possibly even managed noise but Tron was still lost in the haze as the User reached up and pulled him back down, sliding their mouths together in a lusty dance. They stayed like that for a while, sharing the taste of iron between them, slow and hot and beautiful. It lasted for a long moment before the user pushed him back down, guiding him towards the mess he'd made of his neck, forcing him down on it and tangling a hand in his hair.

Tron lapped up what had run over the plane of Sam's skin, shuddering as the taste overwhelmed his senses again. He felt rather than heard the User moan as he bit down again, a fresh well of blood rushing to meet him. Sam shifted underneath him and the program felt as if he should perhaps move but the User's hand was still heavy and insistent at the back of his head. 

He was touching himself, Tron dimly realized, the familiar push-pull shake of his hips just noticable beneath his own and the movement in the muscles beneath his mouth new but recognizable nonetheless. Every motion squeezed another drop of liquid power down his throat, burning a path down his throat and through his circuits, only the tight grip his teeth had on Sam's neck muffling his own pleasured noises.

They writhed like that for what felt like millicycles, Tron's processors unable to correctly track time while so busy handling the constant rush of energy. His circuits glowed purple-white to the rhythm of Sam's heartbeat, growing faster by the microcycle as the User's own motions quickened. The static in his head was increasing to an unbearably uncomfortable level, threatening to drown him in its sea of white noise.

Sam groaned, deep and low in his chest, the sound reverberating through Tron's teeth. It confused him momentarily until he could <i>taste</i> it, the way his blood changed to have that edge of satisfied excitement, and his circuits pulsed. The hot splatter of the User's release across his stomach was just enough contact to have him shuddering violently, processors suddenly overloading into a wave of white-hot light-energy-ecstasy.

---

The sight that greeted him when he rebooted was not one he expected. Sam had bandaged his neck somehow and was smiling down at him, looking far more pleased than Tron would have ever known a User could look.

""We should do this again sometime.""

A shudder of red passed through him as he licked his lips, eyes focusing on the bandage. His thoughts exactly.

<b>Title:</b> Ready, Fight!
<b>Rating:</b> NC-17
<b>Warnings:</b> violence, rough sex.
<b>Word Count:</b> ~5300
<b>Summary:</b> There's a whole underground for the Games. Sam doesn't understand why.
<b>Author's Notes:</b> written for a prompt on the <lj user=""tronkinkmeme"">.


<lj-cut text=""fic here."">
The reopening of the Games is a great achievement.

Sam feels a swell of pride in his chest as the Arena fills with programs again - this time wanting sport and not (figurative) blood. He thinks it's a huge step in the right direction, to stop the Grid from its steady decline. Programs can again fight for the right to be the Champion but not a single one gets derezzed along the way, thanks to his newly-designed stundiscs.

And yet reports keep coming in.

""There's been another game. Reports range from zero to thirty casualties, though no evidence of deresolution has been found. There are at least three different reports of masked figures around Sector 23, rumored to be connected to the incident."" Sam sighs, nods, and sends the security program away. He rubs at his temples, frustrated. There seemed to be no reason for the underground games to continue, since they've found nothing pointing towards the old-style games and everything pointing towards games extremely similar to those he'd opened.

""Tron."" The program looks up from his tablet across the room, counting attendance numbers or something. ""Why do they keep going? Why are they getting so much money?"" The security program rolled his shoulder - almost a shrug, and good enough for Sam. No one had come up with a reason and it seemed to be impossible for any of the security programs to get in. Their security, whatever it was, was excellent.

The idea strikes him as he's lying in bed one night, sleep eluding him. The programs couldn't get in because they were labeled as security. If someone could disguise themselves and get in--

And of course it has to be him. There's no other program that could disguise themselves as perfectly or fully as he could.

So Sam sneaks back into the Grid, telling no one about what he was planning. The portal is open, of course, but the underground games go on regardless of whether or not he's there. A quick, easy bit of code has him disguised as a normal (though rich) program, and then he's scouting out the place his team had thought the next game would be held, greasing programs' voice boxes with money he pulls from nowhere.

Within nanocycles he's in, finding a modest seat halfway back. The game is in a half-abandoned warehouse, set up with a sparse ring and a great deal of chairs. The room fills quickly, and Sam's just glad the Grid doesn't have the same rules as the real world; the number of programs who would be large, greasy rich men is high, but instead there is almost a portrait of what people thought nobility should look like - beautiful, perfect, well-dressed, the prime example of fashion and class. He wonders for a moment if they get as crazy as normal programs.

Maybe it was simply the act of <i>being</i> illegal that drew them here, he thinks. Two programs are led out into the ring and the crowd cheers, as loud as any Arena game. The two ladies - odd, he thinks, as most Arena players are male, though he hadn't realized it before - enter a battle stance with their discs drawn and begin to fight. It's a good fight but so <i>normal</i> and Sam waits for anything that might tell him more. Discs clash again and again, occasionally hitting one program or the other and making their circuits light up with a flash he recognizes as his own stundisc technology. It's good to know at least that deresolution did not seem to be part of the game.

Sam is almost ready to get up and leave when a disc is knocked out of the one program's hand, the crowd roaring. He expects a normal slam, perhaps a smash to overload her circuits, the normal overload procedure, but then she's flipping up again and-- and he gapes as she is suddenly all over the other program, half wrestling and half groping, the other disc forgotten easily. Circuits pulse, not just in the ring but all around him, the entire room thrumming with an energy he'd not noticed beforehand. The ladies' hands are <i>everywhere</i> - roughly groping breasts, slamming between legs, clutching at back circuits - and there are tangled legs and tongues and he feels his own suit getting a little tight.

It hits him. Circuits, of course. Programs had never been anatomically correct - he wasn't sure why, but he supposed there was no reason for them to be so - but their circuits had always been weak spots of a sort. Tron had told him this at one time or another, he was sure. It was part of the reason the outfits his dad had designed were so much darker than the old ones; less chance to cause pain.

<i>Or pleasure.</i>

That was the goal of the game here. Get the other program to orgasm - <i>overload</i> - before you. Basically the same as the new Games, but a hell of lot more exciting. Sam can't deny that this is hot as fuck and he thinks for a moment that he should get out of there before someone notices his erection, but then there's a slam and a positively indecent moan and he knows he couldn't move if he wanted to.

The program that lost her disc seems to be losing fast, parts of her suit torn away and giving access to far more sensitive circuits than those available through it. She shakes, moaning again, and seems to give in, tangling hands in her opponent's hair and forcing her down harder where she's sucking on a patch of skin just above one breast. The other woman doubles in the speed and force of her movements - now that her partner's not thrashing against her, it's got to be easier - and within seconds the tale tell circuit explosion of overload bursts out from the girl below her, coupled with a pleasured scream.

Sam can <i>feel</i> the wave of excitement that flows through the crowd, that sexual static charge that normally is only felt while close but not touching someone you've been lusting over for a while. He throbs and shifts uncomfortably, suddenly hoping there wasn't more because he did <i>not</i> want to clean out one of these suits. The crowd's doing the opposite, though, becoming more and more riled up even as the ring is cleared and cleaned and the announcer comes back out, all angles and bright, bright circuits.

""And now, what you've all been waiting for! Noblest programs, dearest guests, honored patrons... I present to you---""

""RRRRRINZLER----!""

The crowd roars and Sam feels his heart drop. It's got to be wrong, an imposter, someone masquerading to claim his glory - but he steps out and Sam can instantly recognize him in all his glory. He stuttered to find a reason why Tron wouldn't tell him about this, until it occurred to him that perhaps he was <i>embarrassed</i>. His thoughts wandered for a moment, wondering if Alan had a similarly kinky secret back in the real world, but he shook them off as the competitor stepped onto the field.

They both produce their discs, Tron-zler settling into his normal stance and the other program looking far more confident than any program Sam had seen in the Arena. At some unseen signal they both lunge forward, Tron throwing a high punch towards his opponent's face that was blocked with a flash of energy as their discs connected. He quickly follows with a jab to the stomach, dodged with an easy flip backwards, Tron sliding back to avoid a boot in his face. They circle each other for a moment before the other program sweeps a leg down, Tron jumping over and twisting to bring his disc in an arc down to his neck. He ducks easily and Tron rolls to the side, avoiding another heavy swing.

Tron's arm shoots up, striking the program's wrist with a surge of energy and causing him to drop his disc. It gets discarded with a flick of the superior warrior's foot and the battle is quickly changed into a jaguar stalking its prey. Rinzler-Tron circles the defenseless program, straightening up after a minute and rehooking his discs. A ripple of anticipation rolls through the crowd, thick and heavy. Sam finds himself on the edge of his seat and still harder than he can ever remember being. Obviously it's just the environment getting to him; he's sure if it was just him watching it would be weird and awkward and he doesn't even <i>like</i> men, really...

Until Rinzler <i>growls</i> and he swears it's amplified through the audience, each one shivering perfectly with the sound. He shudders and his eyes snap back to the arena, where he realizes the sound is actually a distraction tactic and Rinzler jumps onto his opponent from behind, swiftly pinning him to the ground with a knee on his back and one of his arms twisted behind him. The program struggles, bucking up against him and trying to use his free hand to grab at him before Rinzler twists harder, pressing down against him. They both still for a moment, the helmeted program obviously weighing his options.

The silence stretches, anticipation almost more of a tease than the fight, and then Rinzler is rearranging the both of them even as the other program bucks and twists against him. He straddles the program's hips, sitting heavily on the back of his legs as he twisted the other arm back behind and captured both wrists in one hand's iron grip. His other hand wanders, massaging roughly at circuits, cutting through the suit whenever the program struggles. And he does: shifting his legs to try and bring them underneath him for some leverage, quickly cut off by a press of Rinzler's weight and a sharp gouge in the fabric above one shoulder blade; grasping Rinzler's wrist and attempting to break the hold or throw him to the side, circumvented by raising his arms into painfully high position and making him arch into it, slicing a line down his spine; a last-ditch full-body flop to attempt to unseat him, easily countered with a hot hand up the naked curve of his back.

The program moans at that and it runs through Sam like an electric shock. He wants to know what it felt like to be touched like this - to have circuits so sensitive, he amends, though he's not sure that's where the thought came from. Rinzler's purr is loud now; a steady reverberating hum that feels like it's shaking him to the core. Sam's eyes are riveted to the scene as the helmeted program's free hand roams up the solid line of the other's back and then teasingly down around his chest, pressing deep into exposed circuit lines and ripping shaky groans out of his opponent's throat. He takes the opportunity to shove his fingers violently into the other's mouth, pressing at circuits most wouldn't even think of, pressing himself down against his back.

Something changes, at that moment. Sam can't think of anything except the anonymous program sucking, running his tongue between and over those fingers and teasing those circuits Tron had over his fingers, tasting electricity flowing over his tongue like licking a battery - and then he reminds himself that it's not himself doing it, it's the program. He refocuses and Rinzler growls again, deep and dark and not part of any plan, shoving his whole body down upon the other without restraint and probably looking far too smug as it causes the other to slam down on the cold ring floor. 

Before it had been teasing; rough, perhaps, but not anywhere near as forceful as it is now. Rinzler changes his grip, letting go of his opponent's hands completely only to fist one hand in his hair and slam his head against the floor again, holding it there. The other program can do nothing but whine weakly, arms twitching in a way Sam recognizes as a desire to continue fighting without the energy to. That growl runs over the patrons again and he catches one small program actually faint to the side of him as Rinzler begins rutting against his opponent. He thought he'd seen things that required that word before but this is far beyond that; purely animalistic and <i>god</i> he was too hard for any of this.

The program in the ring screams as Rinzler digs fingers into his hips and he suddenly overloads, actually sending out a visible wave of electricity over a short distance. Sam almost moans himself but catches it with a bite of his lip. He tastes the sharp tang of blood in his mouth and belatedly realizes that perhaps he should have moaned - less obvious - but no one seems to notice. Assuming the match is over, he presses the heel of his hand against his far-too-hot erection in an attempt to settle himself. Unfortunately he makes the mistake of looking back up and that helmet is looking straight at him, still growling deeply with bright-running circuits.

He cums, right there, hand slipping off his suit and eyes wide as he moans and shivers in his seat. A billion things fly through his mind at once - <i>fuck, now I have to clean this thing</i> - <i>jesus christ he was never this hot before</i> - <i>what do I do they might notice me</i> - <i>I have to get out of here</i> - <i>I have to get out of the <b>system</b></i> - but it was all overshadowed by an overwhelming <i><b>he knows.</i></b>

Somehow he manages the coordination to stumble up, out of his seat and the building, fleeing as quickly as possible and thankfully not drawing any odd looks from the other programs in the crowd. Within moments he's on his lightcycle - and fuck, that's cold, and more than a little uncomfortable, but he needs to <i>get out</i> and soon enough he's sitting alone in front of the computer again.

<i>Well, fuck.</i>

<center>---</center>

Half a day later he has to go back.

He's nervous though - fuck, he can't remember being this nervous in his life. Leading Encom was hard but not nearly as hard as facing someone who knew your deepest, dirtiest secret. Who had a dirty secret themselves that had most literally made you jizz in your pants.

Still, there's nothing he can do about it but hope to whatever god there was that Tron would just forget about it or simply drop the matter.

Sam's hands are wet with sweat as he keys in the combination to get through the portal and he shifts uncomfortably in his seat before the laser activates. One deep breath later he's among the black and blue and glowy again, and...

""Greetings, Sam."" And Tron. Looking as gorgeous as always, now that he's noticed it. Fuck, he can't even formulate words now, and his hands are shaking, but the program looks completely unfazed. ""I realize we were supposed to go over the city plans today but we've had a gridbug breakout and I was hoping you'd repair that first---"" And without even realizing it Sam is up and being whisked away into the crazy business of the Grid. Tron is certainly acting normal and Sam was more than willing to go along with it, especially if it would keep his mind off other matters.

The problem was when it didn't. The entire day he could do nothing but watch Tron. The line of muscle as he pointed out another sector. The way his suit clung to every inch of that deliciously perfect ass. The bright glow of his circuits as he leaned past Sam to get something. The way the light accentuated every attribute Sam would rather just ignore at the moment.

Thankfully the program gets called away to help with another gridbug attack. Sam drops his head into his hands immediately after the other has left the room and sighs heavily. There's no way he can get any real work done being this distracted and there's no way he could ever approach the topic. He shakes away the thought and buries himself back in work, determined to get something done this trip.

It's about an hour before the door opens again. Sam looks up to welcome him back and stops short, mouth half-open.

He's got the helmet on again. Everything he's been repressing all day comes rushing back in one heady surge of arousal and it takes every bit of control in him to not moan. Fuck, now he's hard, and the object of his affection might as well be clueless at this moment for all the attention he's getting. Tron, for his part, waves and then sits back at his desk, obviously writing his report on whatever had just happened. Sam can't do anything but stare again, thinking about hard fists and ripping suits and <i>that growl</i>. It therefore catches him off-guard when Tron says something, and he nearly misses it.

""--any other Users through the portal?"" He shakes himself out of his porntastic reverie to respond. ""No, it's just been me. We haven't trusted anyone else yet."" It doesn't strike him until shortly afterwards of the reason Tron might be asking him - he was out on a gridbug mission, why was he asking about users, but <i>of course</i> - and before he can even register it the program is leaning over his chair, that helmet so close that Sam swears he can feel the charge coming off of it, like standing next to a tesla coil. To be completely honest, it didn't feel any less dangerous.

<i>Fuck</i>, he was hard.

""You saw it."" Not a question. Sam feels compelled to answer anyways but his throat has gone dry and he can barely swallow before the security program continues. ""You <i>watched</i> the game. You know what they do."" His voice lowered to a growl, the rumble Sam has come to associate with Rinzler starting up again and sending tremors through him. He'd forgotten somewhere that Tron liked to keep this part of him tucked away under the hero, the savior of the system, the one and only Tron. It was probably a good thing, he thinks, as otherwise he'd have to keep the swarms of horny fans away just like the gridbugs.

They're still not touching but Sam can feel the charge between them increasing. Tron-zler's circuits are slowly turning a deep purple that Sam would bet turns further into a bright red and even just the thought of it makes him bite back another groan. He can't even tell why this all turns him on so much. The growl increases and Sam doesn't even have to open his eyes - when did he close those? - to know that Rinzler is right next to his ear.

""You <i>liked</i> it.""

It's true, certainly, but it's the tone in his voice. He sounds almost desperate. Sam realizes far too suddenly that yes, this is a Rinzler thing - part of Tron that he doesn't like to admit, that's darker than any part of what Alan may have coded - but <i>he</i> likes it and would never want it to end. He doesn't want Sam to shut things down that he knows. Of course, that was the furthest thing from Sam's mind, but now that it strikes him, he knows that reasonably there would be no other choice. Unless, of course, he was to turn a blind eye.

Sam has to prove to Tron that this particular kind of battle isn't going anywhere.

He doesn't know where the courage comes from but he pushes at Tron's shoulders, making the program stumble back a step, looking at him defiantly as he also stands.

There's a small twitch of his helmet and then Tron's circuits turn red.

<i>It's on.</i>

Rinzler jumps forward almost immediately, Sam making an instinctive dodge to the right and causing the program to go rolling along with the chair. He recovers quickly, vaulting over the chair and using the leverage from a nearby wall to swing the object back towards Sam, forcing the User to dodge-roll closer to him and meeting him in the middle. Sam blocks a vicious right hook only to receive a heavy hit in his stomach, winding him. He attempts to elbow the program in the face, missing and clipping his shoulder instead, but still forcing them to break apart. Rinzler rolls his shoulders, dropping into a much more predatory stance as Sam gasps for breath and falls into a half-ready fighting stance.

The program closes in again, aiming a kick for his head that Sam ducks past and counters by shooting a hand up to grab his ankle. Normally the strain of having a foot so high for such an extended period would easily throw an opponent off-balance but Rinzler seems fine even as Sam sweeps out and down to try and take out his other foot. The program twists and jumps and Sam barely manages to let go before his arm goes with it, bouncing off behind him. His arm, still up, half-blocks another blow aimed for his head and he rolls forward just before the program manages to land a heavy hit on his back.

Sam swings around, not ready for the helmet suddenly in his face, grabbing the program's suit without thinking and using the momentum he'd built up to slam them both against the wall, Rinzler underneath him. The program seems winded for a minute, Sam suddenly noticing how bright those circuits were and, in conjunction, how all of this wasn't making him any less hard. He's forcefully taken out of his musings as Rinzler rolls up - was that physically possible? - and kicks him full-force in the chest, sending him sprawling across the floor.

They're not apart for long before the program is all over him, sitting on his thighs and keeping one arm as an iron bar across his throat. Sam is too dizzy for a moment to care but then that other hand is everywhere, searching across circuits hastily. It feels good, but no better than anyone's touch would in this situation - and even as he grits his teeth and tries to buck up, out of the hold, he suddenly remembers that he didn't have circuits. He had an idea of how to make Tron feel fucking amazing but the program, even as the champion in the porn-fight arena, had no clue how to do the same for a user such as himself.

Suddenly, he has an advantage.

Not much of one, though, he thinks as Rinzler growls and presses hard down with his arm, choking Sam as he continued to attempt to garner some reaction out of the user. Sam half-heartedly laughs and uses his own free hands to dig harshly into the bright circuits across the program's thigh. Rinzler's purr stutters, deepening substantially and definitely more like a feral growl now, and <i>that</i> goes straight to Sam's still-present erection. He tries again, raking fingers across circles of light he knew were on the program's back, gaining a rolling arch into his fingers and something halfway between a growl and a groan.

The program won't stand for it for long, and Sam's actually halfway surprised it takes him as long as it does to forcefully flip Sam over, forcing his head into the cold floor as he half-melds himself to the user's back, hot and static and Sam has <i>got</i> to introduce some functioning equipment because at this particular moment there is nothing he wants more than for the program to fuck him though aforementioned floor. That growl is in his ear again, more strained than he can remember it, like an old computer just on the edge of overheating.

""How do you <i>work</i>."" It's not really a question, and the words are more made of anger than curiosity, and then Rinzler's twisting a hand in his hair and grinding against him and Sam's not sure he cares if the program understands anymore. He bucks back up against him, using his hips and trying to get some space between himself and the floor, opening his mouth to instruct but only able to get out some of the most pathetic-sounding moans he'd ever heard. Rinzler growls and both his hands are everywhere, ripping open his suit and smoothing over every tensed plane of muscle.

After that it doesn't take him long to find the difference. Sam shouts as he brushes curious fingers over it, shaking as the point is quickly gotten across and Rinzler roughly wraps his hand around his erection, jerking him harshly. There's a marked change in his demeanor - he pushes down against Sam with purpose, purr dark and satisfied again, and Sam whines completely undignified as Rinzler pumps out a perfect rhythm. He scrabbles at the floor and bucks into Rinzler's hand, vision whiting out momentarily as he spills himself all over the floor.

He comes back to his senses slowly, Rinzler still a heavy, too-hot presence at his back and on his softening dick, his knees and elbows aching softly from the abuse, ribs also protesting due to the blow they'd received. Still, above it all was a too-pleasant, cloudy feeling and the only thought he could focus on was that he needed to reciprocate. Rinzler didn't look like he was going to move - or was going to let Sam move, for that matter - so Sam opted for the forceful way and twisted around, attempting again to elbow him in the face.

Rinzler grunts and rolls to the side, Sam following closely and sitting on top of him, not bothering to really pin him down as this was hardly a contest anymore. The user immediately starts running hands over every circuit he could find, even as Rinzler protests weakly and tried to push him away. They burn like fire under his hands and he dips, tonguing over the too-familiar squares on the program's chest and only half-surprised when it elicits a pleasured growl from him. Sam is more surprised by the overload that follows shortly, electricity humming over his fingertips and tongue as Rinzler shakes beneath him.

He half-collapses on top of the program, finally satisfied, letting his mind wander.

Well, what now?

<center>---</center>

They sit in silence for a long stretch of time, Tron's hand gently running through his hair. Eventually Sam pulls himself together, gently moving off of the program and groaning as he sat up, muscles protesting. He checks the time offhandedly and freezes. If he isn't at the portal within the next half an hour it'll close on him and Quorra will murder him brutally. He leaps up and begins gathering his things, leaving a very bewildered program behind him. Sam is halfway out the door before Tron manages to say something.

""Sam, we--"" ""We'll talk later, Tron. I have to go.""

He's nearly at the portal before he realizes what that must seem like and swears colorfully, but he makes it back in time. He'll just have to come up with what to do while they're apart.

<center>---</center>

Of course, three days later he's come up with nothing and he still has bandages around his middle, ribs a bit more bruised than he'd expected. Quorra thought it was due to a sudden gridbug attack - halfway true, anyways. He can't delay his visit any longer, mostly due to structural damage from the bugs threatening an entire sector of the city with deresolution, and he'll just have to suck it up and try and find the words when he gets there.

Sam activates the laser, the now-familiar feeling of changing worlds flowing through him and he's only half surprised to find Tron already there, waiting. The program looks more nervous - no, that's not the word. He watches quietly for a moment, trying to figure it out. Anxious, he decides. He's halfway to saying something when Tron cuts him off, sounding agitated.

""We need to fix the sector as soon as possible. I'll lead you there.""

Sam didn't want to admit that he was happy for the temporary distraction, but he was, and he couldn't do anything but stare at the line of the program's body as he followed him through the city.

The problem was easy to fix and they were unfortunately back in their offices quickly. Sam shuts the door behind them with a quiet click and looks up, unsurprised that Tron was staring back at him. He flushes, coughing, suddenly awkward again. Tron was the first to talk.

""We need to talk, Sam."" He sounds half as nervous as the user feels, but that was still <i>something</i> and that calms him enough to let out a deep breath, collecting his thoughts and smiling a bit over at him.

""Yeah. We do."" The program begins to say something else and he motions for him to shush for the moment. ""I have a couple of questions."" Tron nods and Sam continues. ""First - is everyone involved properly compensated and taken care of?"" He elaborates at Tron's confused look. ""In the underground 'fights'."" The program seems illuminated and nods.

""Everyone involved volunteers. He pays us well and many refuse even that, taking the game itself as payment."" Sam nods.

""So then where does the money gained go?"" Tron hums thoughtfully.

""Back into the city, as far as I can tell. The... coordinator likes to fund his private interests - special buildings, some of the parks, et cetera.""

Sam smiles. If there was nothing shady going on, even though the entire operation felt like it was funding an underground drug ring, then he was fine with it. Tron certainly didn't seem eager to end it. Sam assumed it was because it let him let off so much steam - let him be professional and all normal <i>Tron</i> while he was anywhere but there. He knew the security program was still having issues keeping the Rinzler personality down and this did seem to help immensely.

""I'm not going to break it up, then. Seems harmless enough."" The program glows with approval, shyly smiling but Sam could see that he continued to be anxious. The one thing they both really needed to talk about was still hanging heavily in the air between them. He coughs awkwardly again. ""So...""

""It doesn't have to happen again."" Sam whips his head back up, alarmed. Tron is twiddling his thumbs and generally looks very much like he'd rather run away, a feeling Sam was quite familiar with.

""...who said they wanted it to stop?"" His voice is softer than he'd realized and the program looks up after a long moment, eyes shining with something Sam really did not want to try to identify. It hits something in him, makes his chest ache with something he <i>also</i> didn't want to think about. He walks closer anyways, reaching towards his face but not quite touching him, unable to really put to words anything else. The program moves into the touch, pressing his cheek against his hand and looking for all the world like a giant human housecat. They stand like that for a while, silent and understanding, until Tron speaks again.

""Rinzler."" It was all he needed to say. Sam smiles a bit, nuzzling into his shoulder.

""Doesn't bother me. Actually... it was exciting."" He huffs out a laugh, burying his face against Tron's neck. ""Though we can't do it all the time. You nearly broke my ribs."" The program freezes, looking as if he was going to apologize, but it's quickly replaced by simple confusion.

""Sam, what are 'ribs'?""

The user laughs and kisses him. Whatever they had, it seemed to be working. Or something. Still, there was one question that was bothering him.

""Tron, do you think I could program circuits?""

this always happens, I swear...

So, PAX was awesome. Working was more awesome. Selling stuff to Tycho was FUCKING AWESOME. Special pink magical-powers badge was FUCKING AWESOME. Humiliating myself for free stuff was pretty awesome too, actually. Picked up a bunch of t-shirts - Vindictus, Dragon Nest, Rock Band, Dance Central, and I managed to get a free Chrono Trigger shirt from Fangamer - along with metric tons of buttons and some other stuff. Bought a sackboy because I could not resist and picked up FFXII since I was going to anyways. The Duke Nukem booth will never fail to make me laugh. Portal 2 looks awesome and so does this game called Bastion. That damn Red Faction booth still makes me nervous. I learned a shitload about Magic and sorted out cards because what else is there to do at an empty booth at one in the morning.

Of course post-PAX I got massively sick (possibly PAX's fault, but who the hell knows) and had my first hospital visit ever - as a patient, that is. Got an IV and everything. Wasn't anything terrible (like the flu, which is what I was afraid of) but it continues to persist with a cough. scared the shit out of my parents, too, so currently I'm home until the end of break.

Meanwhile, I've been playing a bunch of FFXIII and FFXII with a bit of LBP. XII has terrible voice acting but otherwise is totally enjoyable and I still can't remember why everyone kind of hates it. ...maybe it's the voice acting. Haven't caught up in XIII yet.

AND I've been writing more fic than I have in a while. need to do more of that, actually. Next weekend my school's cinema is showing Tron so that will probably get me all hyped up again. Just realized that my BD set will ship only a couple of days before my brother's wedding and now I'm concerned because regardless of whether or not they get there before I leave I will be preoccupied the entire weekend with ""WHY AM I NOT WATCHING TRON ;;__;;"" instead of ""YAY MARRIAGE"" and I already feel bad about it. mgh.

In other news, I finished the first season of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. such a weird little show. Good, hilarious, but <i>weird</i>. No idea how they're going to localize it (if they want to do it well, anyways.)

Started FFXIII again; I was playing on my friend's account when I played before so my 30ish hours will have to be replayed. it's a little odd how excited I am about that. although I am skipping most of the cutscenes; they are rather long and it's not like I don't know what's going on.

Good news: the Tron R3CONFIGUR3D soundtrack is now <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M20YDU"">available on Amazon</a> by itself, without the excess... everything I already own. Spreading the news in case anyone hadn't heard.

Wish I could say I did something else this weekend, but I've mostly just lounged and studied. Class today is going to suck - first rain of the year just started. Love rain, hate walking in it.

Finally got the bug to go through more music again, so my Audiosurf is getting a workout. mm songs. Mostly Vitamin String Quartet - who I highly recommend. sogood.

It's snowing again so the chance of me doing anything useful today is zip. Instead I'll probably sleep more and audiosurf more and apparently tonight we're watching Adventure Time so I'm excited for that, I guess.

Today has been mostly attempting to read through my psych book (as I should have a quiz/test tomorrow, but I haven't been to class in 3 or 4 weeks) between playing audiosurf and adding to my massive, massive amazon wishlist. mmm shopping.

So. Got moved in, eventually. Being here is awesome - less walking and pain, more people and fun. Also the ability to nap. success.

The con went amazingly. Busy as hell, though. I'm sitting here and I'm still surprised it was only like... a week ago.

Managed to not fail in classes last week. Attempting to continue with that.

Broke my glasses and got new ones. Am currently completely broke because of that, but... hopefully I'll get the money back soon.

Been continually playing things on my PS3. Mostly demos, now, but I've also acquired Little Big Planet and Scott Pilgrim (although I haven't gotten around to playing the latter) and I've also also been playing PS1 games. Because goddamnit Spyro 2 is still fun, okay.

Watched a bunch of movies with a bunch of people the other day; Hebrew Hammer, Team America, Teeth, and Sinbad. we're cool okay. The club just started Getbackers and will also be showing Noein, so. (getbackers is so... ridiculous. it's fun.) Also been watching Spectacular Spiderman (dat venom), Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, and a bit of Lucky Star. hurphurp all over the place.

In tron fandom-related news; currently attempting to fill something I promised a week or so ago. Past tense is being silly with me. Otherwise I've been so inactive... feels bad man. Trying to get back into it because I do like filling things and I can sense the momentum in the fandom slowing, grinding to a halt. I've preordered the limited 5-disc bluray and am RAEGFACE that the remix soundtrack can't come with it, but since I already have everything else that does come with it... I'm waiting for a separate release or for someone to sell just the CD.

My PS3 has been most enjoyable. Tron Evolution was... intensely depressing, but awesome. My Tron controller is fucking awesome and much brighter than anticipated. I'm also a little over halfway through Brotherhood, though it's actually my friend's game, and I still haven't gotten around to moving my FFXIII save file...

I'm moving, which is why I've been so absent recently. Finally got a room in the dorm I already basically live in and should be completely moved in by Wednesday or so. Just in time for our convention to run and me to really need a place to crash. xD

Meanwhile I've been staving off plotbunnies while I attempt to keep up with schoolwork and generally just not kill myself doing things. I feel really horrible for falling so far behind on RP but I just don't have the time right now - if I'm lucky I'll get around to tagging some people back today, I hope.

"event","I have finally, <i>finally</i> acquired a PS3.

At the moment I don't actually have any games (inb4 ""PS3 HAS NO GAEMS"") because the person I bought it from can't find the one I want (FFXIII), but Tron: Evolution is on the way and I'm borrowing a friend's Brotherhood until I get my own. I figure those will keep me busy for a while. :D

heeeeeeee i have been waiting for this for so long. <3 now I actually have a gaming system! that's relevant in this day and age! (and I am probably the only person in the dorm that refuses to hack it. :| but that's another story.)

Now to see what effect this will have on my grades. whoops."

"event","woke up this morning (after falling asleep on RP, <i>again</i>, fffuuu---) to SNOW, SNOW EVERYWHERE OH GOD

Stairs are still unshoveled. hiding in my ""real"" dorm forever.

Thankfully I only had one class today and only have one tomorrow, so. No real problems, I think.

instead I will laze around, hopefully rp or write some fic, probably watch more White Collar or Mushishi or Tobuscus and play audiosurf."

""Ekala"" - my preferred username on any site - is simply a name I've been using for many years. Probably came out of name-generating sessions (and by that I mean ""smash on the keyboard and see what looks like a halfway decent name until you come up with one you actually like"" - works better than you might think.) sy_eph is my secondary username and came from a similar name session. Funny how my names are... names.

Toby playing Dead Space 2 = maximum hilarity.

Classes, classes, classes. didn't sleep enough last night. didn't write fic yesterday (although rp'd all over the damn placed). Rinzler, you made my night and the sleep I did get was full of warm fuzzies."

"event","Last night was crazy.

fandom-wise, I've now apparently joined the tinychat group as well as my usual dAmn chat, and I was looking into <i>another</i> dAmn chat and roleplaying like a boss at the same time. Finished another ficlet and hope to make another one or two today; hopefully I've gotten past my bit of writer's block for the moment.

In the meantime, in real life, I went to a local asian supermarket yesterday and binged on food. well, not as much as usual, but still - steamed buns and two packs of mochi and chocolate-covered almonds and hi-chews and then ring pops from the dollar store - it was a lot, and most of it already got eaten. >>;; Watched a friend play some horrible third-person shooter (something about changing terrain) and then Megaman 2; and then saw half of the first open mic of the semester (my friend is actually a pretty awesome singer) and watched Press Start with a bunch of people.

epic.

today's plans: homework, ficlets, rping, probably fucking about on chat. tinychat's got me watching Scarecrow and Mrs King (SMK) because Bruce Boxleitner. mm. so that'll probably get watched too. hopefully some audiosurf to comb through music, as well."

"event","So, Digimon is still awesome. So bad and yet so good. (""They must be programmed for courage!"") Our anime/scifi club had a Digimon night and we watched a couple of episodes, made up our own and drew them (draw three cards; add -mon on the end; things like sexywartreemon and ninjashadowbaconmon), and then watched the first episode of the newest series. We've decided if you took Gurren Lagann and mixed it with Digimon you get the Digimon Xros Wars. it's just so... anime.

Just ordered Tron: Evolution with the PS3 controller last night. Waiting for more of my money to get in and then I'll... buy the PS3. anddd there I go being behind the curve again. In other news, all my newest posters are up and looking beautiful. I think I might be done now; the other Tron posters don't really interest me... I think. And my Flynn Lives pin is going to live on my backpack until the next con I use my buttoncoat at. Supposedly I'm never really using that monstrosity again (due to the Tao costume that is coming along nicely) but who knows.

today: writing things, going over some music. that's the plan, anyways."

A true friend is someone who will listen - even if you haven't talked to them in months. I have some really amazing friends and even as we're spread about the country and the world we connect in a way that I don't think I can really describe.

As for ending a friendship... if I don't like you anymore, or we can't agree to disagree, or something - there will always be a point where you will offend someone I love and then that is when I break it off. And, occasionally, punch you as well.

In other news, I now have three beautiful Tron posters and a Flynn Lives pin (along with my previous soundtrack, artbook, and Betrayal purchases). glee. Shortly a Tron PS3 controller and Evolution are going to join them. because if anything is bad for my wallet it's shiny Disney movies. Unfortunately we're having some drama in the RP section, not to mention my doubts about fic, so my headspace is a little confused right now. I need some sleep... real life's going well, though."

"event","Since I keep posting unanon, figured I might as well try to restart this journal.

So, to anyone who cares: this is a question post. Ask me anything, make me do a quiz or a meme and post the results, whatever.

I'll probably be using the writer's block thing to post everyday - unlike most things it seems to be a good reminder.

aaaand go."

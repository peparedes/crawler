Picture it...My house, 2005....Shannon and I are bored...we go to NIfty Fifty's for a milkshake, but find it to be closed, so we travel to Rita's for a Fudge brownie gelati. After we finish, we return to my house for a board game night. we play Disney's scene it, scattergories, and finally, Candy Land (the 1985 verson [the good one]). Shannon was being stalked by Plumpy and I was being stalked by Mr. Mint...it was a horrific experience....I may never be the same......ok bye!"

Maybe I'm both!"

Yes, not school Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday! Yeah..yeah..yeah!! I went to the Bank today, that was all. Really. That was all. I might be going to Lin Villa with Shannon. I dunno. Ok, thats all of my boring life. Tootles!

Oh yeah! Wait! The guy who plays Locke on Lost was in this movie i watched last night. It was called Sliver Bullet, a movie based on one of Stephen King's novels. It was about a reverend who was a werewolf and killed a lot of people. And he was trying to kill the handicapped boy, but his uncle had a silver bullet made, and the werewolf was beating the crap out of the uncle and the boy shot the werewolf, and he died, and turned back into the reverend. It was weird. But anyways, Locke was the sheriff and his name was Joe, but he got beat with ""The Peacemaker"" (A bat that the bartender used when fights started in the bar, but the bartender got eaten and the reverend took the bat back to his garage and Sheriff Joe was ""Investigating"" and found out that the reverend was the werewolf and the reverand killed Joe.) That was the sad part. I liked Sheriff Joe.  It was an ok movie.  

Byes

I saw grace and the she was pushing past me again and started using the tiolet in the back room (weird). In the dream the manager told this other guy dressed in a costume like myself for burger king to take over my duties becasue i didnt know what i was doing i got upset when he said fuck you and i told her notto talk to me like that again. we were about to get into a little tiff before i stopped myself and asked what the duties were. I had to change the big garbages and stuff. then i went to the back where these two guys were in the dumpster , they looked startled at first but they realized i was with Burger king. in the dream i didnt know where i was until the end when this cutomer said we were so exited when greeting them (it was really me and my gretting but in the dream it was everyone else saying it) it was my exiting greet i would always give everyone and they would make fun of me for. In this dream we were serving drinks and i did not know how to make them for these two customers . I always thought of melinda as a drunk so i called her in the dream to take care of the customers. I notice a lot of water and flood in this dream im not sure what it repesents or if it even repesents anything at all. In my heart i think it represents the washing of my past and me moving on. God has opened another door for me and its time to get walking. In the dream before this i was in a church and the preacher turned straight to me and said welcome in this dream i felt like it was only for me. i believe there was water here too. my mother and aunt were late to the service but i was there. This dream exscaped my memory i just knew i was there. dreams mean a lot to me and i believe god talks to us through our dreams when we dont get the message while we are awake. I will never forget when i had the dream that jesus himself was knocking on my door. i woke up feeling very peaceful and I felt that the message was obvious jesus knocked on my door he was speaking to me asking to come into my life. till this day i am trying my best to be a full christian and read my bible and obey him. i still have a very long way to go but I am so happy he called me , i will never say no. his presence has striked  a change in me ever since that day. dreams are really important to me. this sunday i am going to church for mamas bday . I woke up from these dreams with a feeling that it came from god. i feel like I have recieved a message and i feel very peaceful like my way is being guided. its a strange feeling but aa very fammiliar one like my  jesus knocking one. i will tell my kids that story one day its very powerful. i havent been the same since . but im soooo thankful if jesus has spoke to me i will listen and move on from the past thank you lord for everything you continue to bring in my life . lord i know i do not deserve it one bit but you keep having mercy on my ugly soul and you keep blessing me. i am forever grateful.  thank you"

"event","it really feels so good to move on frpm the negative person i used to be. I have changed in so many ways and i am so proud of who i am . As of today december 16th 2010 I can say that i am on my way to my Glory. Now i am not a fully good person i still have a long way to go, i am just proud of who i have become and i owe it all to god."

"event","Wow today i was looking back on my old livejournal account and found some weird ish! lol i mea just  seeing how i used to talk on the my old blogs and stuff is just weird.i was so childish back then.not th at im super grown now but im diffrent lol.ad i used to write about the most dumb shyt too my entries on my livejoral ad my old xanga were so short they were like two seteces the most!! and went like""hey today i woke up and ate cereal okay im out now thanks guys for the comments"" what? i used to call that a blog???? lol what!these accounts were from 2004/2005 too.its fun to look back though and see what you were going thru back in the past.Me i was going in and out of school getting kicked out for being absent too many times.and i always blamed it on a cold or something yeah right.Ijust wanted to stay home all those weeks.so what i do today besides eat and breathe? shhhhh!! nothing at all.I was supposed to go down to 42nd to take back my aplication i got from down there but i was too lazy to do it so i stayed home.This morning i just wasnt in the mood to get up at all!.i even turned my cell phone down cause i didnt feel like being bothered with anyone.Kevin is haraasing me once again i swear i am on the edge of just telling this little boy to move on with his life and that i want nothing to do with him.A relationship between us will never happen in this lifetime or the next.Im tired of pretending to want him just to get  to chill with my friends.shytt if they dont wanna hang out with me unless they think im dating kevin then screw them all.Im over trying to re-connect with all of them anyway.yeah i had a great summer chillen with them but thats over,im becoming my own best-friend and finding i dont need nobody really.Friends are optional for me now if i come across a cool person than okay we can chill but other than that i dont need nobody around me.I have other things to think about."

So yeah,I'm taking my braids out now i wanna have my natural hair BACK I'M gonna try to make it grow out now,i'm sick of Braids already. I want to do my own hair so i'll have to take real good care of it, I'm gonna get some of those Dr,miracle products i heard they work real good, and i'm gonna go back to the salons every two weeks so my hair should grow now. I've tried to have my natural hair so many times and it never worked for me but this time i'm gonna stick to it.hmm what else happned today....pretty much nothing except me staying home and filling out applications on-line,i have filled out so many that i've lost track. i hope at lest one of them call me! at least one!!!!!C o m e-o n lol, i'll just pray and trust that i'll get an interview."

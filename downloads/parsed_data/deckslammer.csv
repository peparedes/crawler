"event","I'm changing.  Perhaps its the medications.  Theres really no way to know since I will have to be on medication for the rest of my life.  I'm ok with that.  At least I'm learning to be.  I spent my life with my mind racing much faster than my body was ever able to keep up with, and now I've slowed down.  Not that I'm not creative and passionate anymore, but that I am not constantly on the verge of spinning out of control.  I am able to actually create and not just have ideas.  I'm able to follow through with my ideas since my body is now on the same page as my mind.  I'm able to identify my feelings, and desires.  Oddly the calmer I am, the more seems to be coming together.  I just found out that my school is covered 100%.  What?  How can that be?  Somehow or another being <24 has benefited me since they only look at my mothers income and not mine.  Since my mom is completely  beyond poor, I get my school paid for now.  Not sure why I had to pay out of pocket the last year, but who cares.  I need it now.  Not working for so long has created nothing short of a financial difficulty in my life, but it all seems to be coming together ok.  I'm sitting in the coffee shop.  People are completely fucking insane.  Sure maybe I have a diagnosis, but I'm sane.  These crazy people are out of control.  I feel like I need to pick them up and carry them to the psych hospital right now!  The internet is a tool for satan.  Sex is a sin in regards to cleanliness,and whether your clean or dirty.  Drugs is about nutrition not cocaine.  Why do you think it is called the net?  The web? Its a trap.  All the while I am sitting here on my computer.  You fucking morons!  Satan is not controlling me threw the internet.  Masons do not practice satanic rituals!  The masons/eastern stars that I know are the most devoted Christians.  The people are what is wrong with religion today.  I bet next week I'll see her on the news with tnt strapped to her trying to get on a plane.  12 is the number of sex.  13 is the number of drugs.  Soy milk contains estrogen and I""m going to grow a third tit if I drink it.  Oh my word.  God help me.  I must pack up and leave.  I have an hour to kill before I have to be at work, but I cannot listen to this.  Socialistic warlocks.  Come the fuck on you nutcase."

I don't see myself ever truly giving them up, but I find the better you are as a person the more you get walked all over even me, Vanessa, who doesn't take shit.  I'm finishing packing up my house and cleaning.  The worst part is that it's all crap left that should have been in another box, but it didn't make it so now I have ""random"" boxes.  In the last two months I have been through more than one would believe.  I don't care to post it all on livejournal, but trust me you would stand with your jaw hanging to the floor if you really knew.  The thing is, the more trauma I go through, the more life lessons I learn.  I have changed in ways I never knew I could, and I suppose for that I am thankful.  I sit here in my empty house, and I want to cry.  I want to scream.  I want to go punch Robyn (the reason I am being forced to move...my upstairs ""neighbor"") right in her ugly nose.  I want to sodomize Adrienne.  But I don't, and I won't.  I don't want to live my life like a nomad, and then move in with some strange guy to chase him out and then live with other people.  I like having my OWN house, where no one can say or think shit, because it is MINE.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  The next year I will live with people I'm not so sure I want to, but I'll have a place to call home I guess.  I eventually will have a source of steady income, and I will go about functioning like I never had a nervous breakdown.  The world doesn't stop just because you can't function.  I wish I could make it, but it doesn't work that way.  At least I know that God didn't bring me this far to drop me.  It gives me a peace that truly does surpass my understanding. Well I suppose that I should continue cleaning and packing and go about feeling numb to it all instead of thinking about it or feeling it."

"event","I find it entirely to difficult to function at work these days.  I attribute this mostly to being flabbergasted at the amount of stupidity in one place, and my inabilityto comprehend what exactly the management is trying to accomplish here.  They hired a ton of new nurses.  I mean to the point where most days they have 8 or 9 nurses scheduled when there is only room for 6.  They have already messed my whole schedule up and continue to do so as week speak.  I got a call today to see if I wanted to work nights for awhile.  Excuse me?  Do I not have the most seniority on any shift besides days?  I believe I do.  The thing is that these nurses that have started are beyond incompetent.  I can't begin to describe the level of incompetence that I witness everyday...but take my word for it: its a modern day miracle.  Now I am a kind hearted nurse who cares for my residents with all of my heart.  It not only frustrates me to see these woman working but it scares me and hurts my heart.  I seriously can barely stand it.  Unfortunately it has brought me to a point where I can no longer separate myself from work when i am not there.  Basically my solution has been going back to working 60-75 hours a week so that I at least make money while being consumed by my job.  I'm tired of things.  I tired of this world.  I'm tired of health care being corrupt and I'm tired of feeling like there are only a handful of us in the world who give a shit.  Sigh.  Overall I'm ok though.  School is fine...I'm doing well.  I still manage somewhat of a social life.  I'm going to dinner with Amanda tonight so that will be nice.  I know there is hope...."

I feel that I have no reason to be exhausted.  I sleep.  Sure I had finals, and I've worked a lot and I only sleep every other night, but I sleep a lot when I do.  I don't see a problem, yet I know I have one.  I'm purely exhausted.  I am taking 4 1/2 days off of work to clean my house and maybe chill out.  I thought about taking an out of town vacation, but money is tighter than usual and I don't know that traveling would really give me a time of rest.  Fun yes.  Rest no.  I know that I need to take a break because of the way I want to shove a sock in people's mouth.  That is not really that uncommon of a feeling, however when you start actually plotting to do it, it may just be time to rest.  I need more alone time.  More me time.  I have to be at work again at 6:45 so I should sleep....goodnight"

This nurse is just out of my element.  She is so old school and by the book its scary.  Plus she thinks that having an RN title instead of an LPN gives you some kind of secret authority.  I think thats a crock of shit.  The best nurses I know (myself listed in this category) are lpn's.  Being an RN means shit.  It only means you suffered through a little more schooling.  I cannot stand when people make assumptions like that.  Especially someone who quickly proved herself incompentant.....sigh...I should wash up and try to get some sleep.

"event","I have until Monday at midnight to drop my classes.  I am at a crossroad here.  For awhile I had considered doing this program where you get your RN by learning on your own, taking a test when you think you know the material and then moving on to another class.  Your clinical is one weekend where you fly to some random location and prove that you know what you're doing.  Once you do that you can take your state boards.  Its a pricy program, more expensive than LCCC.  Well I had an appointment a couple months ago set up with the guy from the program.  I was sick and scared so I canceled it, and haven't thought much about it since.  Well now all of the sudden several nurses from my work are doing it, and have got me thinking maybe it is worth it.  You see I hate class and I hate deadlines.  I hate planning my life around having to be up for school, or around a test that I have every other week and assignments due all of the time.  It literally takes up just about every bit of free time I have to prepare for test after test (just as I know it does for about every else as well).  To be frank I'm really not ready to be back in school.  At least not going through clinicals and ""NURSING SCHOOL"" again.  Its more stress than I care to explain.  Nursing school is rough, rougher than it should be.  So I'm thinking, well why not drop out of LCCC and do this program.  They get you a loan (not the best interest rate, but I can work with that I suppose) and then you just get through the program and pay like 150 bucks a month (or more if you can).  So here I am trying to decide.  I wish i had the info I need, like exactly what will transfer etc.  I feel that I should be an RN already.  I really should, there is nothing that going to school again for nursing will really teach me.  The difference is what you do on the floor, and when you're on the floor you learn as you go.  Either you're going to be a competent nurse after learning the basics, or you're not.  Thats all there is to it.  Either you've got it or you don't.  No amount of school will really make a difference on the floor.  It really won't.  Either you learn and remember what you learned and adapt it to how it will work in a real situation, or you don't.  

I'm not sure, but I read Irenes Xanga for the first time and there is a post about taking the smooth way instead of the curvy way.  The smooth way maybe be easier in ways...going to LCCC.  Its pretty cut and dry.  I go to school continuously for at least another 2 years (summer included) and then I should be done, with little time to breathe and enjoy life.  Or I try this other way, which may be horribly hard, however may force me to actually learn the material and I could be done within a years time and I could love it.  I don't know though.  I need to get out of my house and stop thinking about this....

Hmmm...what should I do?"

or is anyone else perturbed by the crime in lakewood these days?  I've always been fearless on account of me being invincible and all.  At least thats how I thought of myself.  Lately however, I have felt an underlying sense of fear in my own hometown.  Lakewood was picturesque in a way.  Kids walk to school, kids play outside all day without being bothered except for an occasional shout from mom:  ""Ness!! ZACH!!""  We would of course have just been in the middle of playing in clay we were convinced was the type you could either a)eat(about 4 years old) or b) make amazing sculptures with (a few years later).  We might have been catching bugs, or throwing around a ball, playing with barbies, or school, or hide and seek.  Never did we have to worry that something ""bad"" would happen to us.  When we got a little bit older we started walking across town to the coffee shops or marcs, or a perhaps a friends house.  Our parents were reluctant to let us for fear that something ""bad"" would happen, but it was such an unlikely event that they gave in.  I'm sure partially it was because they knew it was ok to let us go, and partially because they got sick of driving our buts around.  I would sneak the tracks even though my mom said not to, but hey it was faster.  Besides my mom used to..right?  Now....now things are different.  

Those tracks I used to walk are no longer safe.  The gas station I used to stop at to buy candy is no longer safe.  It is no longer ok to leave your door open.  The crime is becoming so frequent.  I never used to think twice about going to the grocery store in the middle of the night.  As a matter of fact I never go to tops before 12 am or after 9am.  Tonight however I found myself debating whether I should.  I decided it was a go, but I didn't just go to the store.  I left a note on my fridge saying where I went.  I live by myself, however I recently started doing this in case I am the next woman to get attacked.  At least people will know where I went last.  I put a pair of scissors in my pocket(I lost my mace) and I got a small purse to carry the bare essentials(money keys phone etc) and I set off to the store.  I look around about a hundred times to make sure all is clear.   I go shop and come out to my car.  Of course I'm safe, why am I worrying?  Then this guy who is sitting in his unlit car starts it up and pulls infront of me before I can get to my car.  So I'm like WHAT THE F*** in my head?  YOU""VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME?  He rolls down the window and says, ""Hey I'm (don't remember name).  I can't help but notice you in the store there.  Whats your name?""  I politely respond: ""I'd rather not say, its 2 am and this is awkward""  He apologized and told me he didn't usually do that(riiiight) and did pull away.  I'm home safe, untouched, and still not afraid(just cautious I guess) because nothing happened.  

I guess I'm just disturbed at the way things have been lately. My sister isn't allowed to walk anywhere, and i don't blame my mom I don't care for her to be the next young girl to get it.  What is going on?"

"event","So I have an anatomy exam at 8am.  I haven't really looked at all of the material...then alone studied it.  I've been trying all day, but somehow I just have decided ""having a life""  is more important to me.  I know I need to go study because if I keep an A in the class I don't have to take the final.  To be quite frank: I really haven't learned much.  I am a cram everything in my head the day before the test kind of person...especially these days.  I'm a full time nurse, I don't have time to worry about learning the extremely useless to me details of the human body.  It has been a good day.  I went to the Phoenix this am to get out of the house and study(instead of falling asleep or getting on here).  It was Josh's last day in the states and so i had a little lunch with him.  It was nice just to have contact with someone who has nothing bad to say.  Then I had lab.  I got a chance to talk to some of my fellow classmates and get to know them a little better.  I had dinner with the family.  Studied a bit, took a 1/2 hour nap, got coffee,looked over my material and then I went out.  I went to the Parkview where they have a open mic blues night.  I couldn't have asked for more fun.  I was with Lindsay and Tina who are just cool people to chill out with.  I danced.  I drank water.  I enjoyed myself.  I can't remember the last time I did that.  

A little story on why I loved this night.  When I came home from my freshman year at college I went to the Phoenix.  I had become a Caribou geek at the end of high school, and by the time I came home I wanted nothing more than to just chill in the Phoenix.  The Ramblers (a really bad but extremely fun honky tonk band) played every Thursday night.  One night while I was sitting there it struck me that I had no business being in Mount Vernon.  I love music, I love people, I loved the nursing home and going to Mount Vernon wasn't leading me to any of that.  So I sat there blown away at my epiphany.  I wanted nothing more at that moment to be the best nurse, and to see live blues, jazz, bluegrass, honky tonk, folk (etc) music every day for the rest of my life.  Well time passed and the Ramblers split up.  The people I used to see live music with moved away and I was left spending every night being a less than best nurse, and certainly not going out to enjoy music.  So at any rate to be able to do something I love so much was great.  I don't even care that I need to keep looking over the material for a test I have in 6 hours for which I must be awake in 4 1/2(if I roll out of bed and go straight there).  I feel great."

I can't explain to you how much this bothers me mostly because I don't think I can go through this interviewing process much longer, and I also don't know how I can possibly continue to pull so much weight at my church.  What i do know is that God gives me the strength.  I just wasn't expecting to have to start over and do the entire search and interview again.  Sigh.  I also have been emotionally drained due to the couple I wrote about earlier.  The wake was today and I just haven't been able to stop feeling so strongly for the wife.  I also am going through a lonely time.  I walked around Target today looking at the cute Christmas dinette sets and I thought ""I would love to have people come over and have a little Christmas get together"" and then I thought ""I have no one who would come.""  Which proceeded to me thinking ""I bet if I died tomorrow a lot of people would come to my funeral, however no one would come to my house for a Christmas get together.  This is sad.""  I don't like it when I get like that however its true in a way, I have little social contact on a personal level...its all work or in passing like at the coffee shop or something.  I need to get of out this mindset.  I should go to bed I'm getting sick again.  Nasty cold."

So I've been working in a nursing home since I was 14.  I know not to get attached at least not enough to where you're going to break down in histeria when someone passes.  However in all of my years of doing this I have never grown so close as i have to this couple I take care of.  They treat me like a daughter.  They're the sweetest Christian couple you'll ever know.  We love each other, we're family.  I can't tell you how many times they told me I was family.  So I go to work yesterday and another nurse told me he died and I just collapsed.  My whole body just shook and sobbed for an hour.  I know I'm not supposed to get attached, but I'm human, and I loved them.  It was a shock.  I didn't expect him to pass.  So I walked around all night hurting with my eyes so swollen from crying I could barely see.  Man sometimes this job sucks.  But what I am confident in is that I made a difference in his life and that will always remain.  I just wish sometimes it didn't hurt so bad.  His wife is with us and I think it hurts me the most to see her hurting.  Sigh...."

I just wanted to share that.  And I also want to share that I still feel fat.  Why?  Will I always feel fat?  Do I have the fat girl complex?  I mean I now every woman out there is self conscious about something.  We all wish we could wear certain clothes, look a little more trendy, a little more sexy in a classy way.  So i know that I will probably always have that, but why do I still think I'm fat?  Sometimes I feel good, and I know I look better.  How could I not?  I have lost over 50 lbs.  Other times I still see the same fat face, arms, legs, stomach, even back.  And I wonderful what do I have to weigh to get rid of all this?  At any rate I'm just sharing.

"event","So I got the job.  It was not hard to get the job, and I actually don't know how I could not have gotten the job.  The pay is no more than what I'm making, which I feel is rather depressing since agency is supposed to pay more.  So I think if I like this type of work i will look around for an agency that pays more.  I told them I could work next weekend(my weekend off) in order to have a trial period before I decide to pull out of my full time job.  

I have mixed feelings.  I adore my residents on my hall.  Sometimes they make me want to cry in pain, sometimes they make me want to curl up in a ball in a corner and shake, sometimes they make me laugh till I cry, and sometimes they fill my with the greatest joy and sense of love and accomplishment I could ever dream of.  I love them.  I will miss them with all of my heart.  However that cannot be the reason I stay in a bad environment.  I found out yesterday that the DON(dirrector of nursing) did approve my PTO time, and I was like aww...maybe she is making an effort.  Then I rememebered...I shouldn't have to request PTO time in order to have time to study, what happens when it runs out?  and I remembered that PTO shouldn't be denied in the first place.  I also had a good night and everything went smooth on my hall.  When everything goes well I want to stay.  Then....our crazy man flipped.  When I say crazy I don't mean alzheimers, or agitated.  I mean psych ward quality.  He should never have been accepted into this facility.  Yes I feel sorry for the family, but he's not nursing home material!  He doesn't need nursing home care, he needs constant supervision.  Hes big, strong, an ex cop, and lost his mind.  He has already hit plenty of staff, and you know what she says:  You guys just don't know how to talk to him.  And also don't let him fall, and get him out of that wheel chair.  It's like listening to a damn broken record.  Thats all she says regarding every resident...get them out of a wheelchair, don't fall, you don't know how to talk to him/her.  Its all she says no matter what the situation.  My word.  So I'm taking a stand, and as soon as I try this job my resignation letter is going on the desk.  I will not be hit or punched or hurt because I am trying to protect my residents from a madman.  Argggg.  If I can work here, I can work anywhere this is the truth."

"event","So I am taking a moment to sit in front of the screen and write about nothing.  I have a job interview tomorrow.  Its with an agency.  I'm not quitting my job until I try it, but I know that inevitably I cannot continue my schedule and successfully complete school and certainly not maintain a life.  I must say I have finally come to the conclusion that I have to work 40 hours a week.  I am ok with that.  I know thats how the world maintains itself, but I do not believe that all 40 must be between 3 and 11:30 at night 5 nights a week.  It is just not working.  So I have told my boss that I am struggling and she has said all of the following things:

""I have too many people to worry what goes on with them outside of here""
""I do not care what you have going on""
""You are my best nurse""
""I don't think I'm going to be able to give you the flexibility you need""

And those are just related to the topic I am now ranting about.  If you only knew the things she says to me on a regular basis.  With that being said I tell you, I ponder why she can't seem to keep nurses?  I don't know if its because shes a bitch, or because she just flat out refuses to work with anyone.  If I am your ""best nurse"" why don't you want to keep me?  As for the fact that she doesn't care...what the hell is wrong with her??? I mean I can see not genuinely caring, but care enough to think of how me struggling to keep up with my life affects HER.  If I can't work there the way she wants me to what choice do I have other than to leave.  I've asked to be dropped down to 4 days a week(still full time).  Answer: ""we'll talk about this later.""  Next answer ""I'm not blowing you off.""  Answer a month later:""I haven't forgotten.""  What sort of answers are those?  BULLSHIT thats what they are. I've asked to split my time up some on days some on evenings (there are openings on every shift): NO.  Then I try the next thing.  Request PTO time every other week in order to create a study day: DENIED.  And thennn she bitches because I call off.  Lets see, if I request personal time, you deny it because you can't staff the damn place, what will I do?  CALL OFF.  Simple answer.  Only problem is that my attendance record looks poor.  I'm sure when she has to be called for a reference she'll fail to mention that she denied me all of my personal days, and that is why I had to call off.  The woman is clearly hard headed.  She listens to nothing and no one other than herself.  Does not take suggestions or input.  Comes in on a rampage every day just bitching.  Every time I've seen her for the last year thats all she does is point and bitch.  I cannot TAKE IT.  SO on that note...I have an interview.  I have nothing to wear because I'm a bum.  I'm scared, I'm excited, I'm sad that I have to change jobs.  I love my residents so much.  I'm attached.  I'm beyond attached with some.  I don't want to leave them.  I don't want to leave my health insurance either.  I don't want to leave the pay, or the weekly payday.  I love many of my co workers and I'll miss them.  However, I will love having control over my work schedule, or more control anyway.  I know I'll have to work when I don't want to, but it will be nothing like it is now.  Now when I know I'll never finish my reading before my test, I'm screwed or I call off.  I will love no politics.  I will love learning new things, and adaptability.  I do also hope to work at my job a couple days a month it is strictly for the purpose of seeing my residents and coworkers.  At any rate I had to vent.  Wish me luck on the interview."

It really seemed to go well.  So I always thought that one day when I meet someone I want to be with that I could live with them since staying with Gary never seemed to bother me.

I thought that would be fine, but now its MY space, and MY stuff, and I'm like dude...leave my shit alone!  It makes me wonder if I was destined to be on old maid.  Sometimes I wonder how God could expect people to get married and live together and have sex.  When can't two people be committed but live in two different places.  Robyn does that and it seems to work out great for her and Tod.  I don't get it.  I don't know that I will ever find someone who I can compromise with.  I really don't....."

However I think its just about time I start to find myself in ways I cannot do at home. This isn't about ""getting away from here""  or even my need to live by my own rules.  For the most part I come and go as I please with very little said.  I have it good at home with my mom, and people say ""why not stay if its so good?""  I don't know why exactly, but I found a nice place that I really think I am going to love and eventually feel sort of at home in.  Its extremely cute I must add.  It is a set back house on Detroit...with practically no neighbors other than the two other people who live in the two other suites.  It has a nice medium size porch, a large living room with a wood burning fire place with leaded book cases on either side with pretty glass.  There is a huge closet in the living room too.  Behind the living room there is a bedroom that is pretty big too with another large double closet.  Then there is a tiny bathroom and a little kitchen.  There is my own washer and dryer downstairs(there are 3 sets, one is mine) and the gas is included in the rent.  The bedroom and living room have beautiful woodwork, and there is a nice ceiling fan in the bedroom, and an a/c.  The floors are hardwood, but there are rugs down already if i choose to keep them, if not I can store them in the basement.  Anyway those are the basics :).  I'm excited.  Too bad I have no couch or anything...I have a couple chairs and a bed and a bunch of beat up end tables....lovely...

"event","I want to just say, that this week is the first time since i graduated high school that I felt like myself again.  I haven't felt like I was useful since the day I crossed that stage until now.  When I was in high school I lived to run the orchestra.  I started out helping as a freshman, and by the time I was a senior emily and I were it what kept it going.  I loved it.  I lived it.  I sacrificed everything for it, or at least time, energy, sleep, and money when necessary.  I had a purpose, I was being utilized.  Once I graduated high school I was lost.  Mount Vernon sucked.  Nursing school blew harder.  And up until now I've hated my job.  What is different about this week: STATE.  I have practically moved into the building.  I worked 20 hours today.  I worked doubles all week, i have not had a chance to sleep more than 3 hours a day since friday night.  I am working 8 days straight.  I am working so hard, i don't even comprehend how I was able to keep going.  I'm dead tired, but wired(which is why I am on here after working 20 hours today).  I love it.  I am being utilized, I'm learning sooo much, I'm doing really really well.  i've already impressed the hell out of state, not to mention just about every person in administration.  It feels good to be doing something right again.  Sure there is SO much more to learn, but point is I have been a nurse 6 1/2 months, and I have proved myself, I am good, i'm going to be great one day.  I have so much more I want to get out, but my eyes can't stand looking at this screen.  All I know is that I hope that every single person I went to high school with discovers what their strengths are and goes for it.  I hope that everyone gets a job that accents those strengths.  Sure I hate my job somedays, for the simple fact that it is a high stress job and females suck.  No matter how much i hate it, i love it deep down.  Sure I have awful days, but in the end now I know that I am on the right track.  When did i become an adult?  And why do I have to go back to school?  blargh."

"event","It's a slightly dreary day and I'm sitting here lacking all forms of motivation.  Yesterday was one of those days I would have chosen not to exist.  I would have begged for an out of body experience, or to have just not woken up.  I mean I don't want to sound over dramatic, nothing serious happened, I just was hit from a lot of angles.  I knew when I got into nursing that it was going to be a high stress job.  I knew that I would have bad days, I knew all that was to come.  I even knew I was going to be hated by people.  Problem is I'm not used to being talked about continuously to my face, behind my back, through dirty looks.  I mean sure there are people here and there throughout school that didn't like me, I had my friends though so what did I care.  At work I feel I'm in a box where everyone is looking down on me and mocking me and slowly they are stomping on it.  I know its not really as bad as it feels.  There are probably more people in that building that think/tell me that I'm a great nurse.  Mostly they aren't nursing staff, but there are a few nurses and aids that will tell me that.  But the rest of them...its like they're trying to crack me.  Trying to see what I'm made of, convinced that i'm make of shit that they can stomp.  Thing is what they don't know is that yes, first I am hurt, but then I gain more confidence in what i am doing.  They don't get me at all.  They don't get that they will not see me cry, they will not win.  I am there for my Residents and my residents alone, and they love me.  And they are taken care of because I'm there, and I have nothing to worry about.  What I just don't get is why people work there if they are more concerned with me than their residents?  Why can't people just worry about them?  Why are they doing things that they are so worried that the DON will find out about?  Why not just do your job right.  I know that their issue with me is the same issue people had with me when I was at Aristocrat.  At aristocrat their issue was preppy little white girl, always perky and bouncing down the hall.  Now let me tell you that is what someone told me.  That, despite those of you who know me, is how I'm perceived..because i run around doing things taking care of my residents.  Now where I work its a little different.  I'm 20, and I'm a nurse.  And I'm a good nurse, and I usually run the shift because despite the fact that I'm an lpn and supposedly can't supervise(I would never what that title for real, not right now), I still end up having to run the shift.  I have the most seniority over all the nurses on my shift.  Ain't that crock.  but beyond that I just want things done.  SO at any rate people hate on me for what they perceived long before they ever knew me.  Blah...ok I need to go get ready for work....later...."

"event","Heres the thing about me...I am a workaholic.  I haven't felt this good in a long time and now I worked 19hours straight and slept 3.  I am feeling pretty good.  I like being busy.  I don't have time to sit around thinking ""Man I don't want to go to work.""  I just go to work and work until I don't have to and can sleep.  Most nights/mornings I get off and go to bed because I have to turn around and be back at work again.  I am working toward a goal and I feel good about it.  Unfortunately right now I am having a hard time putting my thoughts together.  I think i should take another nap for awhile.  So off i go"

I had a semi difficult time sleeping yesterday through it all, and now its just plain obnoxious.  Good ol town house.  I swear these walls aren't that thin...they are just real loud.  I want to escape into somewhere warm and quiet.  I'm talking to my aunt who hurt her knee last night.  Poor thing.  My family has a sucky blood line.  Everything in our health is awful.  I just cherish my life while i'm young.

"event","Just got home from work.  not sure what day it is anymore...too many doubles.  I got a flat tire today.  Normally I would have managed fine because I leave early for work, but I slept all day because I didn't get off of work until 730 this morning.  I know how to change a tire..no prob.  However, I could not get the lug nuts off.  Thank God my neighbor came by and helped me get them off.  I was only a half hour late punching in and my favorite co-worker covered.  

My job is so crazy.  I love it, hate it, loose my mind for it.  I love those people like family.  I give to them as selflessly I can.  Sometimes I just can't give enough.  I find myself learning to be more understanding each day that I am there.  I wish that nursing was all about caring for people, but today nursing is more paperwork than anything else.  Half the time we have to sign things we didn't have time to do and hope that we catch up the next day or that it doesn't matter. I spent the whole night trying to calm a 6'5"" man down from a fit of rage, keep a woman comfortable who had a stroke in front of my eyes, and fight off a woman being completely crazy and belligerentbecause I'm helping her husband.  I find it pathetic that at the end of the night in addition to the meds and tons of charting I have to do, i have to fill out stupid worksheets that my showers are given, that people walked, etc etc.  Its such a joke.  I am not a secretary I am a nurse!

So thats that.  I came home and thought I'd check up on myspace, and livejournal.  I haven't done this in a few days so i thought it would be a nice way to end the day.  Instead I read a post of one of my friends that just pissed me off.  Now whatever you want to post in your livejournal fine, but when its about me and my family i would rather it not be twisted.  Right now its just not even worth the time it would take to rebut all of the things she said in her post.  Well not all mind you some were true, but most were not.  I don't comprehend if it is just her embellishing things or if she truly perceives them the way she writes them.  Either way i don't really appreciate it.  I feel like this is some kind of highschool fight online.  I choose not to reply to her post because she didn't really say who it was, and its pointless to have an argument about it.  And besides, its nothing to argue about...it just hurt.  

So on that note I'm going to bed, I have to work 1/2 of day shift tomorrow, hurray."

"event","I don't know the exact day that I turned into someone I can no longer stand.  I know the things that ate me away, and now I'm left with the reminents of the person I was longing to be.  I am at the point where I don't care what anyone else says, I believe that the second I walked away from a deep relationship with God is the moment things started to go bad.  I'm filled with rage, filled with hopelessness, and boredom.  All the while I know what the secret is...finding myself in Christ not in the world.  Why is it that I fight so hard to prove thats not true?  I know it is...I couldn't doubt it no matter how hard i try.  I am fullfilled with God, I'm empty when I push Him away.  I am hopeful, i know why I'm here.  When I push God away I forget why I'm here...suddenly I'm concerned with success in money, sucess in business...sucess sucess sucess instead of devoloping my character and sharing love.  

I'm frustrated.  I'm frustrated with myself for not letting go.  Why do i do this to myself...."

"event","So long stories made short.  Yesterday I went to get my hair cut by this girl who I thought knew what she was doing based on a license that she had previously.  She let it expire when she was pregnant and now that her son is 4 months old shes trying to earn money to get it back.  Well oh my word, my hair was hacked.  I didn't even realize how bad until the four inch line across the back of my head was pointed out.  So I went to Best Cuts to get it fixed.  At any rate it looks cute, but i didn't want it cut.  I wanted a trim.  Thats it.  Now...man.  Here we go again.  I'm posting some pics from easter so it will show it.  Post more later

"event","I feel like in the last 24 hours I have completely warped back into middle school.  It started yesterday when this 21 year old was harassing my sister.  Come on, 21 years old and you're picking on 14 year olds...you've got to be kidding.  At any rate I just asked the chick to chill out and leave my sis alone.  I can refrain from sending obscenitiesher way, just as long as no harm is threatened on my sis, then I must whoop someone.  It only got worse though.  I went to work and I'm sitting outside smoking a cigarette.  All the sudden one of the nurses just starts in on me claiming everyone in the place knows I rat everyone out, and I purposely talk loud for people to hear me all the while talkig in a voice straight from the hood.  I was pissed, because other people were ganging up on me.  It sort of hurt because thats not true to begin with and the fact that I'm getting attacked over something stupid and a complete lie is ridiculous.  You know, silly me, I take nursing seriously.  I can understand the aids talking trash, but another nurse???  It just makes me mad.  We're supposed to be backing each other, who do we have if we can't count on the other nurses?  NO ONE.  

What I try to remind myself is that they're jealous.  I am 20 years old and I'm going places.  Where as they're significantly older and already stuck.  Plus they know the DON likes me, and not because i kiss her ass or rat people out, but because of the nurse and person I am...K

*Sigh* It's hard to explain i know...but I wanted to vent anyway...

Kristy will be home today :) YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Don't you know your my lilac beauty
shining bright in the deep dark night
i love you deep and calm
like the ocean on heat
and the moonlight disarm

i give it all for your sweet kiss
i give it all for your longing love

a million stars light for you
for your the one that gives me warmth
your my north-east and south-west
and i yearn to touch your velvet breast

i give it all for your tender touch
i give it all for your soft embrace

the heavens part for your rhythmic grace
and angels sway to your dainty face
your timeless beauty touches soft on my tongue
you shine on my love like the luminous sun

...there, you happy you greedy bastards =)

ill blog later, end of entry..."

but yes...it has been the night before the night before last when i last updated on this god forsaken thing...livejournal...as mark said, a willing expression of ones self, in which the world can read...the world meaning the few people that are on my livejournal...haha...who would want to read about me anyways...im a happy boy with a dog named jimi hendrix...and a ceramic dog named handsome pete, im so bland...bland like the taste of a stamp or the colour of black...haha...

apparently i am very close minded, and ive had people insisting i get stoned...i dont think i will...not my ""scene"" as they say...haha...i think ill just stick to being a cheap bastard and get pissed on passion pop...haha...wow...ive got kel into the mars volta...i feel so privelidged and/or special...haha...i was just wondering...can experience influence a being before conception...do the experiences of the mother and father affect hhow the child will become psychologically before the child is yet to be concieved, i was just curious on the formula in which humans exist...of course nobody knows that, otherwise we'd all be perfect, not long now though...DNA engineering all the way...haha...they shall make us inferior, so we will bomb theyre asses back to alpha centuri...haha...stupid aliens...brian molko is a woman i swear, he lacks a penis...but he is extremly cool...hahaha...if i was ever to do a guy, it would be him(wont be happeneing any time soon...haha not my style) but anyways...im stupidly obsessed with at the drive in and the mars volta again...its addictive, just like the bland taste of stamps...

i really need to learn the art of paragraphing as shouldy once said...hmmm...lemme think about it ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ok ive thought about it...and i say no, because paragraphing is over rated...but ill tell you something not overrated...candy and cheap hookers...haha...candy and cheap hookers are great...but not as great as my sweet elizabeth...my darling...haha....

wow i just contradicted myself on the paragraphs...because here i am at the begining of one...and my toes are sweaty...just as the back of my knee is itchy...did you know there is no single word for the back of the knee...i think ill call it the~~~~~~~~~~~~""schnee""~~~~~~~~~~~~~hahah so original mitchell...haha nobody calls me mitchell anymore...well nobody out of school...the only person ive seen out of school is bec, she is cool and she didnt try and rape me, im in appreciation...one thing ive noticed in the recent months is that ive become increasingly strange and ive realised i have more female friends that male friends...which is strange in itself...because everyone knows im a narcissitic pig...go me, i used a moderatly big word...i know a big word...antidisestablishmentarianism....haha thats very long... it means to be against the disestablishment of the church of england...in the classical sense...if i ever have a hideously ugly child...i shall consider calling him eugene and/or termanuckle...because if he is my child...then he will most definatly be ugly because he will be from the fruit of my loins...haha...

arrrgggggg paragraphing sucks mofo(insert american accent here)...im in a really fucked up mood at the moment...perhaps i shouldnt have had all that milo...haha milo... the strangest word known to man...other than toast...haha...one thing i wonder...why do they have a setting on toasters that would burn the bread to a level that no sane warm blooded animal/mammal would eat??? when ghandi tells me that i shall shake his hand...tho i would already shake his hand because hes a champ...ok thats my dribble for the night...i need to drink water, urinate, then sneeze, then sleep...haha...ok fare thee well my deciples...i shall talk to you on the other side of the moon(sorry to steal your phrases kel)...ok end of entry...

"event","Hello all...the night is strange, the air is thick...and i am sitting here pondering...and being a conversationalist with griggs...were discussing our very very badly philosophical views...

   Were discussing the fallacies involving the modern social aestetic views and the problems of not being psychologically and politicially aware...because in essance none of us are aware...were all masked, were all confined, all confined to the stereotypical conformist image in which we are doomed by...we are our own demise...and in all this we are still unaware...were still full of existential unknowns...and this universal spree of falsified ""just"" causes is what is suffocating humanity...because nothing in this world is just, not love, not compassion, not generosity, not mallice, not anger, not ignorance, and not irrationallism...

   Though many beings prenounce that they are in fact ""in love"", you must wonder, what is the definition of love...people say love cannot be defined, it cannot be put into words, because its only a feeling...but you need to consider when that someone decided to put a word to that feeling...decided to call it love and not hate...i consider that love may not exist, and only certain peaks of ecstacy...because even in todays modern age...or atleast most people, love is still a physical thing...it is simply a hallmark emotion disguised in history...

   History, the defining contribution to our future, and also the defining future of our demise...as we all repeat past mistakes...and even with all this modern day ""technology"" it still wont change...humanity is a constant fight for superiority bled from the wounds of prehistoric existance, yet today its so much different because we have such invalid idiocracies concerning foreign policy and/or compassion, whichever comes first and looks better on CNN...

   Media propaganda, more apparent then ever in modern day society yet so invisible to the human condition...its constantly spewed out...just a constant campaign of fear and injustice...and yet the modern sociopathic american can give $5 to the red cross and think he is ""doing his bit for society""...yet funding the bombing of combodian villages...whether dileberate or not...whether apparent to the tax-payer/puppet...it is still a falsified sense of comfort and solitude in their own 4-lock front doors, which rest in the 2 story house, which rests on the ""great"" american soil, which rests on the valued and/or tyrannical views of the modern corporate agenda...and once again this all fall down to existentiallism...

   For none of us know the explination of human existance and its value to the universe...or whether to solve our differences and live in a universally utopian society (which i highly doubt will happen, because the destruction of the human race is much more probable)...well that means nothing now...and nothing i ever say will change these unjust/just occurences(it depends on what view you have on this subject, and whether you believe if the ""american dream"")

   And before you all think im simply conforming to the ""fad"" of hating america and such...i am not...im simply probeing the social and ethical inequities of society today, which is most apparent in american suburbia...

Guns, gay marriage, abortion, there are a crazy amount of big issue questions going on right now.  I feel at the center of it, as a Christian.  I have a 'people are wrong on the internet' thing going on here and I want/need to get it out.

Lots of assumptions are made about what Christians think and feel about these issues.  Let's remember that not only are there different denominations (and some churches that are 'non-denominational, like the one I go to), but also that people are, you know, different.

It's sad and not just a little frustrating that the craziest (or most conservative) voices are the most often heard and quoted.  They do not speak for us.  Jerry Falwell saying that 9/11 happened because of the moral downturn our country is taking (and Pat Robertson agreeing with him), the Westboro Baptist Church picketing funerals, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtmWU0Mwe7E"" target=""_blank"">this guy saying Pokemon is demonic</a>... they don't speak for me.

Bob Goff (author of 'Love Does') speaks for me: ""Some people will always be skeptical of extravagant love. Give them something to talk about. @LoveDoes""  

and 

""Real grace is never incremental; if we just give some, we didn't give any. @LoveDoes""

and

""It's easier to agree that everyone('s) invited, than to act like everyone's welcome. We need to work on the welcome part. @LoveDoes""

The only 'crazy' we (as Christians) should be tried and convicted of is 'Crazy Love.'

So that's my starting point... 

Here's my next step.  We can't make people do what we want them to do.  Friends, significant others, co-workers, kids (oh how we wish our kids would do what we want...), they cannot be controlled.  We can only worry about how to change ourselves.  

I can't take my beliefs and put them on someone else.

I love the analogy that I heard (somewhere on the internet) - that it's like going on a diet and then telling your friend they can't have any chocolate cake either, not because it'll tempt you, but because you don't think it's right.  

So there are a lot of things that, while I don't necessarily agree with, I don't think we can stop other people from doing them.  Which, to get at where the rubber meets the road, means we can't legislate against gay marriage, early-term abortions (because they have been there already), or anything else that supposedly goes against 'my' Christian beliefs (and there is even a question on what those beliefs should be...)

Abortion is a tough one. I don't like it.  Never have.  Don't get it.  But what I really don't understand is how 'pro-life' and 'pro-choice' became the two sides to the issue.  (Really? Someone is against life?  Wouldn't pro-death be the other.....oh...I see what you did there.)  And pro-choice.  Someone is against choice?  It sounds very existential. Something Rush would write a song about. <i>""If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.""</i>  ""No thanks, just give me whatever, I don't care..."" 

If we think about it, can't we have both?  This is like having a Pro-Salad and a Pro-Soup appetizer committee.  Or pro-lemonade and pro-ice tea.  

Here's my take...The problem, I think, is that neither side trusts the other.  'Pro-life' proponents think that people are going to use it as birth control.  (A thought I've had more than once).  And, if you're 'Pro-choice' do you think if we limit abortions at all, then you've 'lost?'  I feel like just the word 'limit' brings up images of the government (or conservatives, or whomever...) trying to 'mess' with people's live, just for the sake of messing. Just my perception.  However, there's some common ground here.  (For example, I'm for the morning after pill.  Hey, if you don't want kids, fine.  I know folks bring up adoption (and I'm a huge fan), but there are many kids as well that are in neglected homes, not just teen moms that (together with her significant-or-insignificant other), made one bad decision.)  

Sure both sides wish the line were a little more left or right, but, isn't that what 'bipartisan' is supposed to be about?  

To me, Planned Parenthood and whatever Anti-Abortion group wants to step up need to get in a room with some doctors from both sides and make good, informed decisions.  Lock them in the room until they come out with legislation everyone (ok mostly everyone) can agree on.  I know I'm probably simplifying it, but they know the issues/facts/studies better than I do.  
Get them together, make an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_(drink)"" target=""_blank"">arnold palmer</a> and call it a day.

Gay marriage is easy - it should be legal everywhere.  Period.  It's turned into a civil rights issue.  This is a prime example of going on a diet and expecting everyone else to stop eating cake as well.

Oh, and it's not really morally related, but I don't get how more guns are a good thing. I think this idea of 'protect yourself' is not only outdated/obsolete, but I don't think it will result in this 'safe utopia' that folks think it will.  Frankly, I don't want to live in a world where everyone's packing. Unless, you know, zombies.. then yes.

Me to fireman: Can I call triple A to come tow it?
him: No, not in this situation.
me, thinking to myself: Aren't they 'emergency roadside assistance?If this isn't an emergency, then  what is?
...
...
...

We're headed to pick up Jonathan from my sister-in-law's house.   My wife and I had just left my work when I had gotten on the onramp.  It's a particularly nasty one, where I have to cross 3 lanes of highway to get where I want to be.  This, coupled with rush hour, means that I'm planning ahead as soon as I get on the on-ramp.  I need to be up to speed to merge with traffic.  Unfortunately, the woman ahead of me (who's fine by the way, just to get the important stuff out of the way), does not think like I do.  She does the thing that I suspect gets a lot of us in trouble.  She goes, and then stops.  When she goes, I think she's gone, so I start to dart out into traffic.  She is stopped at this point, and Newton's laws of motion take over.  

...........

I can't explain to you, if you've never been in a car accident what it's like. You have to experience it... Well, you don't HAVE to experience it, I'd rather you not.  I'm not talking about a bumper-to-bumper slow speed bump where the drivers take more out on each other than the cars do.  I suppose this one was mild by the extreme other categories - there was no rollover, no fire, no one went through the windshield. I just hit her car hard.

...

The smell.. that's what I remember first.  The airbags popped out, just like Mr. Subaru promised, and I realized that I was ok, and not bleeding. 

That's when I realized I was about to ask the question that would determine how this was going to go. Was this going to be a crazy story, or a life changing event?

Me (turning to the right): Hon, you ok?
Her : Yeah, I think so.

...
Deep breath.
....

Well, we then did just about everything wrong.  I opened the door w/o looking, and thankfully no one hit it - they were staying away.  I then had Liz go to the side of the road and get on the other side of the guardrail.  There was a space for cars there, and thankfully no one decided to go around us the other way, so she made it ok.
...

Had Jonathan been in the car, the next few mins would have been much different.  That was in back of my mind the entire time. 
... no air bags in the back.......he just uses his booster seat... would he have been leaning forward..... etc.. etc..

.....

So I ran out to the other car, hoping that they were ok.  
I take that back, I wasn't even thinking at that point, I just knew that I had to check on them.  Turns out it was an older woman (approx 60s-ish).  She looked ok though definitely seemed to be out of it.  I couldn't see any blood and told her I was calling the cops.  

...

Some guys stopped to help her.  I could tell they were pretty unhappy with me.  I asked for help moving my car to the side of the road so that cars could get by and they said, ""No, we should wait for the cops"" which is stranger talk for ""go screw yourself, you rear-ender of nice old ladies, you""     I couldn't blame them, frankly.
When she sues me in court for mental trauma, I hope it comes out that I went and checked on her first.
.....

I could still smell the air bag-gas.  And I was feeling it on my arm - where the air bag opened and burned my arm,  There's a patch of hair that's gone.  I remember thinking how I can't believe that's all that happened.  And then later, going, ""Man, that really hurts""... what a difference a few hours makes.

...

3 fire engines, 2 cop cars (state and local ) show up, as do the EMTs.  We sign the ""I don't want to go to the hospital, but won't sue you guys if we die later"" forms.  I found it surreal.  

I should have started with that.  It was all very surreal.  I kept thinking how final it all was.  As I looked at my car, I kept thinking, ""that just happened. and It can't unhappen.""  if that makes any sense...
...


We still had to pick up Jonathan at my sister-in-law's, so we had my MIL (she comes to the rescue of us so often I'm thinking of getting her a cape) drive us home to get our other car.  She told us to be careful and all but pleaded us to pick him up tomorrow.  

So we went home for a bit, and processed.  I asked my better half question after question about how she was feeling - was she ok? did she want to go tonight?  What was wrong? (that would not be the last dumb question of the day).  etc..

She was getting out the list of Jonathan's birthday party invites - to see who had responded, and I got out a book and decided to settle for a bit.  

finally, after some more random questions I asked her ""So, are you overwhelmed?""  This is something she tells me from time to time, it's one of the things that I know when I hear I need to seriously change my tactic - settle in a bit and start to make decisions or give her space, or whatever.  

Her: ""Yes....No.... I don't know... maybe.""
Me: ""I tell you what, I'm a bit overwhelmed myself.""

After I told her that, I felt better.  I decided we'd wait 10-15 mins and see how we feel.  I found that the longer we waited, the better I felt about driving.  I wanted to see my son, but was a bit apprehensive of driving.  I also decided I needed to get 'back on the horse,' and not wait until tomorrow to drive.  I was ready.
....

on the way down, again I smelled the air bag in my nose.  I kept thinking how bad of a smell is, and then my mind opened a bit to realize that this horrible smell actually saved my, actually saved our lives.  We had gotten into a doozy of a wreck, and not only had walked away, but were getting back in our other car (another Subaru), and heading down precisely the way we had just come.  

Well... not exactly, I didn't have to use that on-ramp this time.  I don't think I'll be using it for a while. I've hated that for a long time - it's actually part of the reason I wanted a car with some zip, I wanted to be able to get up to speed and merge as quick as possible.  

...

I found it interesting -- the mixed emotions I felt toward the other driver.  While I was frustrated beyond belief that she had come to a complete stop on an on-ramp; I was really just thankful that she was ok (and didn't need an ambulance), and very sorry that I had just put her through what I put her through.  
...

It was indeed my fault.  There's no way around it.  My dad always told me that whoever does the rear-ending, it's always their fault.  Well, even if that weren't true, it would be true here.  
...

I used to love driving, and loved that car even more.  It was the first car I actually got to pick out.  While I was grateful for all of my cars... buick century, ford bronco II, ford aerostar van, hyundai elantra, ford explorer, ford escort it was the subaru impreza (2009 - I've never had a car that new!), that I picked out after all of the 'well, what do I want"" and what would be good.  At the end of the day, sure, I liked the style, but I also highly ranked 'safety'. I guess it was a good choice in that realm.
....

On the way down to pick up Jonathan I felt the urge to scratch my arm, and forgot that I had just been burned there, so, yeah, that hurt.  The song that was playing was called 'beautiful scar.' And while it was really about the scars that Jesus had on his hands and feet, I couldn't help but correlate it to my own 'scar.' This 'scar' is part of what saved me, and is the reason I'm writing here.

It's the reason that I was able to walk away. it's the reason I was able to ask my wife how she was doing, it's the reason I was able to thank my MIL with an extra kiss for bailing us out again. It's the reason I was able to drive down to RI, and chat with my wife about life, and why things happen. It's the reason I was able to help my SIL with their computer problem. 

It's the reason I was able to hug my son again.

That scar was painful, but it saved me from things FAR more painful.  Had I been given the choice, I would have taken the arm scar 7 days a week and twice on sunday.  

How many other times in life have I had to experience pain, because the opposite was even more painful?  

...
..

I got home and as I started to write this, I smelled the air bag smell again. It seems to have settled a bit in my mustache.  When I did, I smiled.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Prayer?"">

So last week a friend of mine had a rough weekend.  I told him that I would cover for him this weekend and play electric at church, even though I wasn't on.  That was Monday.  Monday night he accepted and they put me on for this weekend.  This was something that I really was psyched to do.  He's someone that I look up to, a leader I really admire.  Though they were rough circumstances, I was glad that I finally got to give back, even a little, to someone who has given so much of themselves.

Tuesday work blew up.

Ok, not really, but it felt like that.  What started out as ""Hey, can you try something real quick?"" became a huge, high level, sensitive project that I was suddenly in front of.  Often times I'm happy to do that, because, frankly, it keeps things interesting, and allows me to use some creative juices.

After I heard that the work to put the code in would go in this weekend (and they normally test Sunday morning), I did the most productive thing I could think of.  

I went straight into denial.

""That's not going to happen... it's not a big deal.."" etc.

Except it was looking like I wasn't going to make it.  Here's the sequence of events that came next.

Wed - Meeting with my boss and team lead.  I was going to support the 'testing' on Thursday night, and then support it going 'live' on Sat/sun.  (Sat/Sun TBD at the time).   So I'm wondering if I should mention Sunday AM, but I feel bad, b/c whenever something like this happens, it seems like I'm always on, on Sunday at church.  Work comes first, however if I can find someone to cover for me, that'd be great.  When I can be on, for work, I'm always on.  I think people get that. But folks understand that I really enjoy being at church on Sunday, (if I'm on doing sound or playing guitar).  If I""m not on - it's a no brainer, I just miss church.  I don't HAVE to go (though I certainly like to). But if I'm on, I know that bowing out at the last minute is tough for folks to deal with.  
Anyway, i think you get it at this point.

So I'm not mentioning it, I'm still in denial at this point, hoping it'll work itself out.  I feel like I should mention it, but I feel bad b/c I feel like at some point they're going to call me on it.

So I'm in the office with my boss, and he notices that I had put for Thursday off.  the 'testing' wasn't going in until Thursday night, so I'd be back by then, so I was not worried about it.  

However, b/c he's a great boss, he asked the question ""Hey, I noticed you were going to take Thurs off, but you're testing, you ok with that?""

Just like that, an opening, ""Yeah, that's totally fine.  I'm going to be back by then. thanks though.""
""However, if there's any way they can test Sat night / Early Sun AM, and be done by 8, that'd be great, b/c I'm on at church this week.""

So my team lead mentions that he can cover, if necessary.

At this point I need to tell you the specifics of my prayer.
I prayed that we would test on Saturday night, and then that we would test (with the other team - ummm.. long story), PRIOR to me going to church.  I figured that since they're in the UK, they would be up by 9, so I'd have to be ready by 4 AM.

Turns out God let me sleep an extra hour.  They wanted to test at 10 AM UK / 5 AM ET.

Yeah, the testing with ""group 1"" didn't get over until 2:30 AM, and I had to then get up at 5.
But that's what I asked for, with an hour buffer. And if it went over, my team lead could cover.

Which he did, from 7:30 - 9AM ET. Just enough to hang out on the call and answer some of their questions.  It made me feel better that I had already sewn up most of the issues, and just had to give him a quick update (so that he could update mgmt later).

...
...
..

So, what does it all mean?
Coincidence? My team lead covered for me, and would have done more if needed.  I prayed to God, but then I asked for help, does that count? I'll admit I don't have an answer to why He answers some prayers and not others.  This to me was a clear answer.

I prayed hard to be able to play today.  It's been a while since I've wanted something more.  I just wanted it to work out.  I didn't want to have to go back to him and say that I couldn't make it.  The ironic(?) part of it is that he ended up playing anyway, adding quite a bit to the songs (because, well, he's better than me).  I think he just enjoys playing.  One of those guys that would play 162 games if he played baseball.

I think part of it was that God's wants and my wants were aligned.  God wants us to be happy, but not at the expense of our souls.  So when I pray for stuff that He knows wouldn't be good for me (even if I think it would be), i don't get it.  I feel like He honored my request, because it's something that He wanted for me.  Also, I think it's just the season I'm in.  It's a good season, when things are active and moving.  

We still have questions about why stuff we really wanted isn't going to happen.  Big, life stuff. Stuff that I would have gladly worked today if it meant I got this other thing that I thought was a sure bet.

He has a plan, a big, sweeping plan for Everything. 
Today, my very minor piece, a piece not really important to the Plan as a whole, worked out.  May not mean much to the others in the plan, but it means a lot to me.

On Saturday we went to an Easter Egg hunt at 'Christian Book Distributors.' They're in Peabody, MA.  I thought they were putting it on, however it turns out the actual store (a big warehouse where they sell lost of Christian books, CDs, etc..) was closed.  Another church was using the large lawn outside to have an easter egg hunt, and provide a jumphouse for the kids (all free), and sell some snack-type things (cookies, etc.. - not free).

As I knew it would be, it was unbelievably packed. We got there a few mins after 10 and found a parking spot in the back.  Not too hard to get in; though  no one was really guiding things in that area (this will be important later).  We were stopped a few times as we got closer for people handing out registration slips - we needed to register for the egg-hunt, and then would be told which square on the grid we could go to that coincided with the age of our kids.  Parents and kids waited out side each roped off square until 'GO!"" and then, well, we went.  Liz took Jon to the K - 2 section and I took my 2 yr old niece to the toddler section. Wicked fun 'uncle' time.

So, generally we have fun, and I appreciated it all, until we were leaving.  
I happened to see a guy in a security jacket stopping people from leaving.  My first issue with this was that we were LEAVING.  We did not need direction at this point. I know the way home. He would have been helpful when we were pulling in to point us to where we could park, or to say 'welcome.'  So I was dubious to begin with as to what service he was providing.  

We got in the car, waited a few mins - steaming a bit, but ASSUMING he had a good reason, ""Hey, anyone missing a kid?"" or ""We found this 100 dollar bill, did anyone lose it?"" or ""Just wanted to say Happy Easter.""  Any of that would have been fine - I didn't really think it was anything like that, though I checked the back seat for 2 kids just to be sure.

When we got there the guy held up a flyer, ""Did any of you get one of these?"" 
Me, ""No""
Guy: ""Another church was trying to take credit for what we were doing here, and posted flyers on all the cars. I just wanted to say that this was done by ""Such and Such"" a church and we put this on. Thanks.""

Me:(Inside..many questions bubbling...looks in rearview mirror to see long line of cars waiting to get out.) ""OK"" 

And for the entire ride home, my wife had to listen to me question this, repeatedly. And then my son heard me talking, and I explained it to him as well.  And then I took a break to listen to music. And then I got angry again and expressed myself as such vocally again.

Here's the thing....

First, who the HECK cares gets the credit? You know who should get the credit? God. That's who.  I'm sick of one church trying to steal members from another church. I feel like I need to discipline them like I do my son, ""This is not OK.""
What happened to 'To God be the Glory?""

If someone came in that was checking out 'God' again, enjoying it, that would turn them off faster than ""Hey, if you're coming to our church, could you bring your checkbook? We could use the money.""  This kind of infighting irks me about Christianity.  A lot.

Secondly.  { The rest should be read in your best <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Boston_Legal_characters"" title=""Alan Shore"" target=""_blank"">Alan Shore</a> voice} 

This guy is angry because another church was deceiving us into thinking that they had put the free egg hunt on instead of them.  This same guy that was wearing a 'Security' jacket and is deceiving us into thinking my stopping was a matter of security.  He had no church Paraphanelia on.  He was wearing a security polo shirt and a security windbreaker.  I don't know if he got them because he knew no one would stop for a simple church ""Hello, my name is"" name tag; or he was doing actual security.

If he was doing actual security, there were a few other ways he could have been better utilitzed. 1.) Overseeing the jump house - that was an absolute madhouse, and many parents were trying to keep things safe themselves, but there seemed to be no one doing anything from the church.  I'm pretty sure a few people were there, but they didn't do anything - and every change for the better was by a parent.  2.)  The aforementioned craziness arriving and parking.  

Had he been there in either place, I wouldn't have been as angry. However he had no purpose than to say, ""We did this, I'm lying to you and stopping you and making sure that our church gets all the credit, please come to our church - look what we do for the community.""

In closing.
I'm glad I go to a church that doesn't do this.  They care about people, not about 'doing things' for the outside world just for the sake of doing things to increase their numbers.  Serve in a tough area of peabody, go somewhere where NOONE will know who you are, just that you're a follower of Jesus.  Then point them to their closest church.  So that they can follow Jesus. Not you.

The entire incident reminded me of something I read in a chicken soup for the christian soul book a long time ago.  I loved the lesson; I don't remember it entirely but here's the basic story:

Two churches were on opposite sides of town. They poked fun at each other a lot, and often fought for members, though all in good fun.  One Christmas, they both decided to go out and do things for their members.  So groups of people did that for each church and came back to the church to tell their story.  One of the groups were some teens that said that they went all around raking leaves, taking out the garbage, and just doing all kinds of odd jobs - but in and around their rival church's area!  At the end of their talk, the pastor says, ""Well, didn't you explain to the people who you worked for that you went to our church?""  And the teens replied ""<strong>No, we didn't think it mattered</strong>.""

Scene: On the couch with Jonathan in the early AM before school. I had downloaded a new Wii game the night before, and told him that if he got up and got ready quickly, he could watch as I went through some of the beginning scenes. It has some intro it's going through, as the game is starting up, and I'm reading the dialogue out loud to him.

Me: (reading) ""....We must find all of the solar cells in order to open up new worlds. Only in this way will we be able to save our own world from destruction."" 
Me: (I then immediately see my wife walk by the dining room into the kitchen) ""Hey, there's some bagels for you on the table.""
Jonathan: (Looking up at me very confused and quizzically, yet seriously.) ""Did the aliens say that too, or were you talking to mom?"" 

...
...
...
That is now, officially, the funniest thing I've ever heard.  

Especially later on in the day, when I made a fool of myself laughing out loud, seemingly at nothing, but all the while imagining some aliens being like, ""Dude, you're going to be hungry traipsing around the universe, so there's some bagels there on the table, for when you get hungry.  Peace out.""

"event","I always imagined that my last day of college would be filled with me getting in my car, turning on ""Summer of '69"" or ""Banditos"" (I almost chose 'Down Together"" because then I could make a - ""both songs are sexual references"" joke, but then that might have derailed things more than they are already - and it most definitely would have been Banditos - so, umm... lets move on ) 

Also, I say always, but somehow not until just now realized that that was part of my vision. 

So the conclusion to school feels like something is missing. I've done my last post, I've passed in my last project.  I've dealt with Senioritis for the past 2 and 1/2 terms; it's all just what I expected, but somehow not.

Every school I've left has been with unfinished business.  High School was an absolute infinite list of 'things I should have done' among the occasional painful regret.  And somehow it went downhill from there.  I went to Valley Forge, where I then went on to the Air Force Academy, just like I was supposed to; but then it turned around faster than an M.Night Shyamalan movie on fast forward.  I suddenly found myself at UMassLowell, standing outside the Air Force ROTC office wondering if I wanted to go through all that again. 
Turns out, something said ""No"" and I went for criminal justice instead.

<i>""Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun""</i>
-Author Unknown

It was then that the above verse hit me, specifically ""Spend your lives in sin and misery.""  Did I think I could do that? Deal with everything they have to deal with, stomach it all and still have room for Pad Thai? The answer is no.

So somehow i found myself working as a waiter looking for direction.  Thankfully, through a friend (which is actually how I got both jobs in computers - THANKS GUYS!), I was able to get in and start to learn about how to put a computer together and how they worked.  It's important to note here that when you're building a computer from scratch, you need to use spacers in between the motherboard and the side of the computer.  If you screw it directly into the side of the computer, not only will you short out the motherboard, but you'll have to ask for a new one - and I guarantee that you won't have a more forgiving boss than I did; who just handed me another one.

At Polaroid, I learned as much as I could, all the while taking some half-ass courses from UMass and having all kinds of fun in our computer <s>gaming area</s> lab.

Apparently that's exactly what my next employer was looking for, b/c I then got the job where I am now.  I've been here at JPM for 11 years, though it was at about the 7 year mark that I realized I needed to remedy the whole ""I don't have a degree yet."" thing.

The best part was that they had something that Ive been looking for since Plan B was implemented (Plan A being fighter pilot.... I almost can't say that with a straight face now). It was a combination of criminal justice and computers.   I swear to God UMass had nothing like this when I first got back from the ""land of mountains where dreams are crushed like tomatoes and served up on a crispy crust""    I feel like UMass looked at me like ""Gee, sounds like an interesting idea... so seriously - computer science or MIS? ""  

When I got home, someone should have shown me a technology tree.  In some games you need to first build one thing to then build something else.  However you can't build everything all the time - you need to make a choice as to what type of technology to 'go for.'  I wish I could have said to someone ""So, in about 10 years there's going to be this show called NCIS; I want you to lay out a plan so that by the time it comes out, I'll be McGee.""  

In any event, it was about 3 years ago that I decided the next step in my life needed to be classes.  My wife had just finished her degree, so I'm sure that played a role.  She finished it quickly, and I was like ""ok, if she can do it.......maybe I should ask <i>her</i> if she'll take classes for me and finish my degree too.""

Unfortunately for me, she said no, and said I'd have to take classes myself.

So, I started Kaplan, IT with a minor in Computer Forensics.  I love computer forensics.  It's fun to learn new things. It's fun to learn new things about where data can be hidden, and then how to find it.  I wish the experience at times had been more hands-on; but I'll take what I can get.  It's time to start mucking about with it and seeing if it's something I can move forward with.  Have I found my 'what I want to do?""
We'll see.

At this point I'm deciding right now to enjoy my accomplishment.  It feels incomplete because the money stuff isn't all sorted out, so they're going to hang on my degree for a bit, I imagine; but I don't care. I'll get it sorted at some point.

Part of me feels like I'm settling.  Like Plan A didn't work out, so I'm going to do Plan B and be happy about it, but I'll always wonder why Plan A didn't work out.  It's like I'm on 'let's make a deal,' and they're showing me what's behind the curtain, and I can see that it's a car, but I'm still wondering what's behind door number two; and they're telling me to take the car, and I do. But as I'm driving home, i'm thinking about what might have been behind door number 2.  

Unless I'm driving an Aston Martin, because, seriously, that would just be greedy and pretentious. 

Wow, that post was a bit longer than I expected (and more rambly), I blame ""Enya"" radio on Pandora."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Lost Series Finale - SPOILERS"">I'm watching the lost series finale, so I thought I'd live blog it.
I was thinking that I should've had a party or gone to a 'lost' party tonight, that would've been fun.

I keep telling myself 'it's just a dumb tv show.' but I realize that this 'dumb' tv show has me up at 1am, barely through the first 30 mins.

I guess it's not a live blog - I tivo'd it and have been staying off of fb to make sure I don't see anything, but something told me I need to catch up on all the saved ep's and watch this one at least before work tomorrow.

I keep having thoughts throughout the show - the first one while I was watching the 2 hour pre-show thing; so I wanted to get them down.

The first thought was, ""gee, after seeing where we've been, they're going to have to have a huge 2 hour episode to close it all up."" 
I was wrong, it appears to be 2 hrs, 30 mins. It's going to be a late late night.

I love the Star Wars cracks by Hurley - more confusing than Yoda - and ""I have a bad feeling about this.""

I find myself, watching the coffin being dropped off at the church and picked up by desmond - I wonder if that's how the man in black ended up getting off the island - he's Christian.  

When Jorge (Hurley), said ""we still need to keep somethings close to the chest"" I had been thinking that he meant the finale was going to leave some questions unanswered - and had an urge to go to their houses and beat them silly.

ONe of the biggest complements I can give to the show is that whenever it goes to commercial, I'm utterly RIPPED back to reality. It's crazy. It reminds me of watching 'Field of Dreams' on TV, and having them cut to commercial JUST as Ray meets his dad. It's like ""Hi Son."" ""Hi Dad."" ....""Dove is filled with minerals and vitamins....""   LOST is the same way, except, at this point, it's EVERY single commercial break.  I keep thinking that they shouldn't have run commercials - just gone to black and played creepy music or something. In that vien, I wonder if Disney, 6 years ago was like ""Hey, we need to make a movie called Prince of Persia - but we need to get it CRAZY press... we need someone to create a show to market it, and see if we can run commercials during the series finale - get JJ Abrams on line 1.

Jack went from being 'leader' to 'pseudo-leader' to 'whiny'. In the 2nd to last episode, when Kate goes, ""We need to kill Locke"" Jack said ""I know"" like he was luke telling Jabba that he was going to give up Han or be destroyed. It's on.

Terry (Locke) said it best - watching the finale is liking getting to the end of an awesome book. You don't want it to end, but you also want to see how it turns out, but it just keeps being 'awesome' so it saddens you even more that it's ending. (Paraphrase)

(:35) I love the duality of the jack and locke have been butting heads as jack and locke, and now jack and locke are butting heads as the smoke monster and jacob - it's like a Red Sox fan butting heads with a yankees fan during baseball season - and then butting heads as a Pats and Jets fan (respectively) during football season.

 Thinking about the pre-show thingy - I'm totally into their vision for the show - it's about the people - not the island. I think that that's what has kept the show successful - sure the 'WTFs' have been amazing and fun - but it's centered around the characters.  People you both like and dislike.

(:41) I'll be honest - the Desmond thing has me baffled.

Shannon and her brother are like the Pete Best of LOST. ""Wow, we're on a great show, what an opportuni... I'm what? I'm dead?""

Ok, the 1 hour mark. Cool.

For the record - I've had ""We are everybody"" in my head all weekend.

Desmond has been down a well - only to be pulled up, and then dropped down basically another one.  He must be pretty sick of water at this point.

Jack's supposed to protect the light - well thing, right? He's had the job for like 6 hours and not doing so hot.
It's like my first day waiting tables, when I dropped a tray like 20 minutes in - of course that dropped tray didn't end the known universe.

(1:10) Water and blankets - all you need for any delivery.

(1:24) It's good to see the 'old' Locke, when he was a favorite character, and not, you know, like, the devil.

(1:33) They'd never do that, but it FEELS like it's going to end up with one of those ""it was all a dream"" things.

(1:36) Hurley's not going on the plane?

(1:42) Duct Tape! (Also, w/o Miles, this show wouldn't be near as flavorfull)

(1:45) I remember not fore-seeing the Sawyer / Juliet coupling happening - still seems like an Odd couple to me. I tihnk they sold it well, though.

(1:55) Hurley? Really?

(1:56) That bottle will be sold on ebay for 1 million dollars.
(Just noticed that the time elapsed in the show is exactly the same as what time it is right now - weird)

(2:12) There will never be another character like Benjamin Linus.

(2:13) I'm already wondering if I'll keep it and watch it again. (but not tonight)

(2:15) I love the 'asking for help' vision. They stayed true to the show.

(2:16) Hugo is one of the only characters on TV that can say ""dude"" and have it sound true, and not forced.

(2:17) I heard the door creak a little bit, and thought ""if that's someone breaking in to kill us, please wait until Lost is finished.""

(2:20) That casket is empty. 
(2:20) OMG I called it, empty casket! 
(2:20) Um, I mean, oh no, empty casket.
(2:22) but totally not for the reason I thought.

(2:24) I'm going to turn into that annoying person at the movie theater.  
""Who's that?"" ""What's she doing here?"" ""What does that mean?""

Someone tell me what the #$%@# is going on.

Seriously, I'm stuck on ""You all created it so you could find each other"" and the ""some die before, some die after""

So, no plane crash - or the plane that flew over them was Lapides' plane, right?

Time to delete lost from the Season Pass Manager - prob remove the channel 12 ones (reruns) but not the channel 5 ones (yet).

God help me, I'm actually watching the end again.

Here's what I'm thinking. 
So Hurley, as the new Jacob, created the church as somewhere they could all meet - a place that doesn't adhere to time 'rules' ?
But Christian says 'you call created it."" How did everyone create it?

Struck by the fact that they don't even mention the island - it's all about the people - cool.

I'll be honest, I was looking for a Jack / Sawyer hug on the island - glad it was there in the church - very cool moment.

On Thursday I got to the gym and did my usual workout. When I was finished, I checked my phone and saw that my wife had called. Twice, in the span of 3 mins.
At first I was worried, so I called right back. After gettnig through to her (and mistaking her mother for her, who didn't know that Liz had called me and was like ""why are you calling?"" which is very confusing when you expect to be greated on the phone by some form of: hospital - paramedics - stitches ....) then Liz gets on all out of breath:
""You won Red Sox tickets, you need to call the guy back, here's his number.""

So I get his number, call him back, he says he needs me to fill out a form and fax it to him.
I do (I check to make sure it's legit first, this definitely falls under the heading of 'too good to be true<b>*</b>', but it was very legit<b>*</b>)

Then, it's 'who do I take?""

<lj user=""frawst""> lives too far away. As do most of the people who look at Fenway like I do.

My first realistic thought is that I should take the guy that took me earlier in the year. He gets discounted tix (standing room).
I feel I owe it to him. 
But the thought that keeps nagging me is: ""First Red Sox game.""

Jonathan is 3 (but really almost 4), and would enjoy it. But I don't have one for Liz.

Liz and I discuss it, and I start thinking about just him and me.

Finally, I get past the 'should do' and get to the 'want to do'. And I realize that I""m taking my 3 1/2 year old son to his first red sox game.
And the room gets a little dusty.

There will be pictures and vids (once my phone decides to work with the cable and my laptop), but for now I""ll just write here that it was both everything I thought, and some things I didnt.

I was nervous the whole way there, like this whole THING was too good to be true, it wasn't going to happen.
Like how, in '04, none of us counted the World Series before the final out. There was always that ""this isn't going to happen.' thought

I told the guy we'd be there at 6:30.. after traffic, subway delays (some due to the 'T' itself, others due to mistimed ""Daddy, I have to go potty'), we got there at like 7:20, in the bottom of the 1st inning.

One of the toughest decisions I've ever been a part of, was the one that Liz didn't end up coming.
I know that if someone had taken Jonathan to his first red sox game w/o me, there would have been violence.

I told Liz we could scalp tickets, or go to the 'scalp free' zone. (I even indirectly asked the guy in an email if he had another ticket). 

We both did the 'well, what do you want to do.'
Finally it came out that she would go, if we had the ticket, or if I REALLY wanted her there, but it turned out she was more worried about us in Boston by ourselves than caring about going to the game.
(I mean, Of COURSE I really wanted her there, but not at the expense of her stress dealing with the extra ticket, etc..)
Plus she had plans with some friends so she could go have fun too.

(I guess, as I'm thinking now, it'd be like her taking Jonathan to the Christmas Tree shop for the first time and being like 'Want to go?"")

So Jonathan and I got to Gate 'E' and I called the guy.
He came out, gave us our tickets and we walked down to Gate ""c""

Gate C. Of Fenway Park. To see the Red Sox. With my son.

I was at Def-Con ""<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120686/quotes"">Stepmom</a>"" when we walked through the gate and I realized it was happening.
(Seriously, have you ever SEEN that movie? it's like they set out to make a movie in which the audience cried every 5 mins. here is actual dialogue. Have tissues ready:
7 year old son, to mother who is dying of cancer...and it's getting close: ""Noone loves you like I do.""
Mother: ""No. No one ever will.""
Ok, take a minute to compose yourself, then continue.)

It was the bottom of the first, we were already up 1- 0. 

We went to the concessions and got 2 hot dogs, some peanuts and a water, and then walked up to go to our seats in the bleachers.
(Yeah, I won bleacher seats, which is sorta like winning a Lamborghini and then finding out that it doesn't have A/C or power locks.... seriously, I'm not complaining)

My favorite part of going to Fenway is the walk up the stairs, when the field just OPENS up in front of you and ......there it is.
I walk up and find our seats easily (that never happens), and we're 3 and 4, which means we're ALMOST on the end of the row (which is good when you have a person that eats like he's preparing for hibernation 24/7 and has the bladder the size of the dot of the 'i' in the small print of any legal document.)

We sit down and I finish my dog in about 5 pitches, and Jonathan eats a little of his hot dog and then goes for the peanuts.

So far, Dice-k is having a good night (A fact I wouldn't really notice until the 4th, when I start focusing on the game, and not on the moment)

the people around us are cool. I was happy for the folks to the right of us that switched with someone who watned to have his whole family together in the bleachers, and got to sit in much better seats.
There was an older couple in front of us and behind us was a group of people that were my age or a bit younger, but were low key.
In fact, they were playing with Jonathan, and we got toa point wheere they started sharing their food with him (boston baked beans (the candy), junior mints, popcorn, etc...) 
He was loving it. I had bought him a baseball, and they were kidding around, playing, taking it from him, and at one ponit it got dropped and almost lost.
And the guy was on his way to buy him a new one, when we saw someone playing with it a few rows down, and quickly got it back.

I forget that people can be good. I tend to think of people as 'in my way' b/c I see them in the car, or taking my time at work.
I forget that I'm not necessarliy the star of my movie. 

Anyway, I'm not sure of why I'm writing, I realize.
Do I want to tell every little detail, so I remember forever? Or am I just interested in the highlights, to convey the feeling.

This is all I can convey:
There was a time that I didnt' think we'd be able to have kids.
We found out that I was thisclose to sterile, and it wasn't going to happen.
Many tests, trying for years.

And then, I was at work one day, when I got a phone call.
9 months later, we named him Jonathan ""gift of God"" 

And then, I was at work one day, when I got a phone call.
One day later, my dream came true.

I was thinking about why this is such a big deal.
I'm sure it is for reasons I can't even comprehend right now.... but what came to mind was that being Jonathan's dad is the only thing that I ever did that I felt like I was supposed to do.
When I play guitar, or am at work, or talking to people, or even working on computers, it all feels like I'm just doing it to bide my time until I do what i'm SUPPOSED to do (work wise, or whatever).

But when I'm doing 'dad' stuff. I feel like that's where I'm supposed to be. Where I can be me, and live up to who I'd like to be.
(that was a lot of 'e' sounds, wasn't it.)

Yes, I still feel bad about not bringing Jeff. However, he's a dad, I think he'd understand.

<i>* That's one thing that I learned here. I usually worry about worse-case scenario, <a href=""http://xkcd.com/349/"">Like this.</a>
But Friday I learned first hand about the Wonka Quote: ""Charlie, Do you know what happened to the kid who got everything he ever wanted?""
Charlie: ""No.""
Wonka: ""He lived happily ever after.""</i>

<i>* When you sign up for Red Sox Nation, you get MLB Audio, discounts, and then you get to put your name into a lottery for sox tix. And, yes, Monster seats would've put me over the edge as probably the best day ever.</i>

2:31 is very early in the morning. It's very much time for me to go to sleep.
instead......I sit waiting for the tiredness to come, and wondering when I had that double-espresso-super-mega-gulp that's keeping me awake.

Hopefully writing will help.

I keep thinking... no coffee today, no soda, just water with dinner, mexican for lunch..... all I had was a large iced tea (sweetened)
would that have done it?

Or is it the game that I was playing on the internet.

Or am I still awake wondering if ""Leatherheads"" really was that bad.
(it wasn't horrible, it was 'cute', at best, IMHO, but that includes some ""these people worked really hard on it"" empathy with it)

Life really hasn't changed much. Working at the same place, hanging with the family, hanging with new church friends, hanging with old church friends, laughing, playing music. ...


Being ponderous at 2:30 in the morning.........

I got to work Thursday morning, and, as I took a deep breath and thought about beginning my day, I looked up at the ceiling.
I'm not sure why that's important, but, as if this idea had been up there for months, all I had to do was look at it, I thought about what it would be like if my past self came into the future... and how I'd feel like I'd have some 'splanin' to do about whyI'm not currently fulfilling any of his 'dreams'

I keep trying to put it aside as a midlife crisis, but I think it's so much more than that. 
I think it's that thing inside of us, that is pushing to get out, that we try to silence by showing it all the other things in our life that IS really cool.

Wow, I'm a horrible 'splainer.

It's like 'do I want to DO this?"" ""forever?""

Hell, maybe that's what a midlife crisis is.

I'm good at what I do, a real go-to guy at this point. Sure I have my 'whoops, didn't mean to break production there, hee hee, that's me. that's my bad.'
But, usually it's b/c I was trying to fix my own, or someone elses issue.
In this economy, we're expected to do way more with way less.

I have a job. I should not complain.

I forgot how cathartic it was to get stuff out in black and white.

I feel like my body is in ""stay up late to get a term paper done' mode.
But I have no paper to do, no test to study for. I just need to sleep.

the other possible reason is that, usually, on friday's, i'm EXHAUSTED.
because, well, from Monday to Thursday I get up at anywhere from 7:30 to 8:30.
And, most Friday's, I""m up at 5am.
And at Joe's (my counselor's) at 6:15. 

So when I get home, I'm asleep by 10:30, or, if i'm not asleep, I shouldn't be operating any heavy machinery......or a stapler for that matter.

Counseling has been going well. It's still weird that there's nothing to really track my progress... or they're few and far between when the instances occur that I think ""wow, I handled that better""

I got pulled over on thursday, after work, and somehow was in a good mood afterwards.
After the $100 ticket and the $127 towing fee (MAN, I'm glad I have AAA, not b/c they'd cover it, but b/c, when my car DOES need to get towed for a real reason, it won't be that much, and that was just like 5 miles, tops)

I had an expired registration. See, I was using my mother's car for a long time, so my car was at my dad's house. (she wasn't driving, and wanted me to drive it to keep it running/clear the snow off of it in the winter)
So when I finally get my car back from my dad's, it fails inspection. He had taken it, and brought it to me, and somewhere along the way we lost the registration.
So, no big deal, I'll get a dupe one, online even for like $10.
Well, we found it the next day. AND I noticed when I was getting a dupe one, that it'd only be good for another month.

But, of course, fastforward a month, and I'm thinking I renewed the registration already (even though I had only ordered the dupe one online).

So, Wednesday, on the way out the door, liz reminds me to renew the registration. And then she calls me at work and says ""Do you want me to do this for you?""
I'm like ""no, you do enough, you do everything; I""ll do this.""
Well, I didn't

So, If I had let her do it online that day,that night she'd have given me the email that acts as your registration until the new one comes in, so when the cops pulled me over, I'd have had it.

Yeah, so, long story short........ LISTEN to your wife.

Oh, and I'm an idiot.

I used to have some time at work to do stuff, I no longer have this time. 
When I""m at work, I have to focus on WORK. (I know, I know, I'm just as shocked as you are.)

Jonathans been fun lately. He's been 3, which means that he's like ""No, I'm not going to do that.""
But it also means I can teach him things like ""where's your muscles"" <he holds up both his arms in the 'make a muscle pose'> ""RIGHT HERE.""
And, this one: ""Jonathan, where are you going?"" <he holds up both his arms in the 'make a muscle pose'> ""to the GUN SHOW.""

he's shorter than me, does that mean I'm abbott and he's costello?

It'll be 3am in one minute, I think I'm going to try to lay down considering I have to help my mother move <strike>tomorrow</strike> today.

It's Gina Torres birthday today (and was <lj user=""frawst"">'s yesterday.

So, in honor of <lj user=""frawst"">, YOUK will hit another game winner tonight. (so it is written......so it shall be done)

And, in honor of Ms Torres, here's one of her lines from 'Serenity' --> <b>Do you know what the definition of a hero is? Someone who gets other people killed. You can look it up later.</b>

I was called home from work early b/c our son had put some toilet paper in the toilet.
That sounds, on the surface, to be a good thing, until I tell you it was an entire roll.

We won $$ in a football pool at work b/c of the interception return for a touchdown at the end of the half. As disappointed I was in the Cardinals, I was happy to make some money off it.

I also got a raise and a bonus at work. This subsequently meant that the next few weeks of my job would be very stressful and challenging in every way. While I'm grateful to have a job, and to have gotten both a raise and a bonus, in this economy is just unreal, the instance of me wanting to throw things at people at work (clients and internal folks) is rising.

Jonathan is 3, and is potty training. He was ALMOST there, and then the accidents started back up again. This is much more stressful for my wife during day-care than it is for me.

We changed home group / bible study / journey group / small group / mid week group / crazy christian group / whatever you want to call it.  Our old group sort of disbanded, the leaders were starting another group (a group for newer folks in the church).  I adore the new group. It's got the worship leader, a few folks from the worship team, and some other folks that I enjoy spending time with. It's also a good mix of married/ married with kids / single / folks that should keep things interesting. 

3 years old is a fun age. He can do some things by himself, but can't do other things (see toilet paper incident, above). Last night I put him to bed and walked out of his room, and told him I'd check on him in 2 mins. A little over 3 mins later, I stood outside his room. He heard me ""daddy?"" 
I said it was me. He said he was scared.
I told him we would both look for monsters. I was impressed that when I walked over to the closet, and he was standing in front of me... when I opened the door he didn't flinch...... heck ""I"" flinch. I've read enough Stephen King books / short stories to know what could be behind that door.  Not him. He just opens it up and looks inside. ""No monsters in there.""
Once we did the monster check, he went back into bed. I told him I'd check on him in 5 mins. 
A little over 5 mins, I tip-toed into his room and he was sleeping. This was huge. Although we have a long way to go (he still doesn't want to go to sleep, and fights each step along the way), that was a nice step.

I got 'Flight Simulator' for christmas. At one point I came into the living room while Liz was watching TV and excitedly explained that I figured out what 'trim' was. I had heard and even read about it... but once you actually SEE it, it makes a WHOLE lot more sense.

Of course, I made the mistake of playing once when JOnathan was awake (and doing something else). As soon as he saw me, he wanted to try. I'm amazed that he can figure out up / down. He even is learning left/right.  Thankfully, you can't actually 'crash', you just sort of bounce off of things, so there's plenty of room for error. So I let him fly solo, and then we do aerobatics that would make Chuck Yeager yuke.

And then there was the time he said he wanted a fly a plane. I told him I wanted to try one of the helicopters. Well, he'd seen the cockpit of a helicopter, and apparently he remembered it, b/c I tried to float it past him that we were going to do a plane and he was like ""No dad, that's a helicopter. "" So I switched.

My parent's divorce is final. I didn't go into the courtroom the first time, but the judge didn't end up seeing them then.  The second time, a few weeks ago, I went in.  A few cases in, they were up. After all the weeks, months, years of back and forth, who's right and who's wrong, doctor's, lawyers, up, and down, will they or won't they... it came down to ""Do both of you understand the paperwork that's been presented to you?"" ""Do you understand the arrangement?"" ""I know this has been a trying time for the both of you, and wish both of you the best of luck.""

And that was it. 5 mins later we were out of the courthouse. 10 mins later we were having breakfast. Together. All mad surreal. I was very impressed with the judge. Each case he heard he seemed to really care about the people involved. It took him a few mins btw each of the cases to get up to speed, and once he was up to speed, he was involved. The wheels of justice may turn slow, but this guy was committed to getting it right; and he seemed to really empathise with whoever was up there. Kudos to him. 

I'm on facebook, if anyone would like to find me.

I'm pretty psyched for MLB network. So far it's just hot-stove stuff and the occasional game from the '06 world series, but the closer we get to the season, there'll be games, and more news to report. I'm like, how do I tell Tivo ""Ok, when you're not recording anything else, record THIS."" Of course, that wouldn't matter b/c they show the same stuff over and over again, but you get the idea. It's 24/7 baseball. 

Finally, the other 'group' and even 'individual' ""weekly meetings"" I have are going well. I'm learning more about what makes me tick, and trying to find out where the anger comes from. It's a bizarre process, it's like you're walking this line of ""CHange yourself"" and ""Be OK with who you are."" 

You probably know my feelings on the Varitek situation, but when he finally signed, we toasted with a glass of his wine. And I don't drink. 
I thought he should've fired Boras with how it all went down. 
But then I'm thinking about who he is...and how he'd never do that. He's been with Boras for a long time, and I bet that Boras knows just what buttons to push to get the Capt on his side.

I just hope the fans treat 'Tek well this year. If he hits .220 ... so be it. I think he does enough other stuff to make up for his bat. I think this year depends more on Papi's wrist than anything else (and if Ellsbury can get back up to Playoff's '07 level, and if Clay and Jon pitch well...and.....well.....ok it depends on a lot, but it starts with Papi's wrist).

My brother in law (Liz' brother) is back from Iraq. He's back at the base in Texas. 
That breeze you saw moving across the country from east to west a few weeks ago was his mom breathing a sigh of relief.

'President Obama' is a wonderful thing for this country. I just love the fact that (besides the conservatives on WEEI), most people are happy about where we're going. When's the last time THAT happened?

We saw 'Defiance' at the movies. I can't believe I saw Daniel Craig first as a Belarussian Jewish guy instead of James Bond. It was a good movie (not great). The STORY was great. I was telling Liz that there's something that happens when you're reminded of the Holocaust. When I remember WWII, (well, not REMEMBER, more, think about it... I mean, I'm only 33), I think of Normandy, of Wake Island, of the B17, the P-51, of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band of Brothers'
It takes me a while to get to 'Schindler's List' To remember the incredible atrocities that went on. I wanted to find Bin Laden and tell him ""See this? This right HERE is a messed up dude. This is REAL insanity. You'll never be this. You're a chump. You're nothing."" 

Did I mention I was psyched that Liz wanted to see 'Defiance'? We usually can't agree on a movie. She's like ""Ok, I'll go see that."" I was thinking of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" instead, but she wanted to see the WWII holocaust movie. She likes the 'true stories' and anything about the holocaust. Her being Jewish and all. (by ethnicity, not religion)

While I've been typing this, my son was laying on my shoulder watching me type....
About 15 mins ago, he fell asleep. There are worse things.

I'm going to put him to bed, and then try to work on the toilet for a little bit longer.
And then watch 'lost'.

A few months ago, channel G4 started playing 'Lost' from the beginning. Being 'with Tivo' I started recording it and watching it daily (a new ep m-f).
I'm now all caught up, and am watching it new like the rest of you.

The next section talks about Lost. If you're watching it from the beginning and haven't seen it all.. DON'T READ IT. I'm kind of assuming that most people are caught up and have seen Seasons 1-4 at this point, but, just in case....
Because I forget all HTML right now, the ""*"" will denote when it's safe to read again..........

<font size=""-1"">
And now, that I'm talking to people who watch Lost (my wife does not, she says it's too creepy for her.) I need to confess something. My favorite character is Sawyer.
There, I said it, it's out. 
I mean, it's not my fault, they killed Charlie. I like Hurley, but he's only JUST recently been used more. Sawyer has become what Jack should've been. Jack has too much baggage to be the hero. Now that Sawyer has become less selfish, and has been looking after people, he's the true hero. (And this was BEFORE he jumped out of the helicopter, but probably around the time he gave Miles a restraining order to stay away from Claire)
Besides that, the relationship I enjoyed the most was probably Hurley/Charlie. Hurley's reaction when he finds out Charlie died is heart breaking. And while we're on the subject of great scenes.... the phone conversation btw desmond and penny (on the Freighter.. God rest it's soul) was SO well done. It had just the right amount of angst, love, risk, and then the outpouring of emotion at the end.
It's a really special show. 
</font>

*OK, hopefully I didn't spoil anything for anyone. I mean, I kind of figured if you're not watching it now, you never will (or will in the far-future, when you'll forget my post anyway), but I also thought better safe than sorry. 
We're also still watching House, Scrubs, the Office, 30 Rock, and Liz is now watching Grey's Anatomy.  

Well, it's time to put my son in his bed and work on the toilet some more. You'll forgive me if I've rambled on about things...... some of it is me not looking forward to plunging.....and at the same time enjoying the sound of my son's breathing / resting on my arm....... but it's been like 9 weeks (so LJ tells me ) since I posted, and, well, life doesn't stop for LJ.

Wow, for 'summing up', that was a loooooong post ;)"

"event","thisclose to 3 (2 months) is apparently close to, if not THE perfect age to go trick or treating.
At least, in my extremely limited parental experience it was.

How do you not think a 2ft tall batman is cute? (give or take, I forget how tall he actually is)

I left work a little early, an decided that since we hadn't seen mom in a while, we'd take her wth us. Which meant pushing her in her wheelchair. Which meant Jonathan was like ""ride with grammy?"" and ended up getting a ride all over town.

What we did this year was close to perfect, it will need to be tweaked a bit, but I think this is a good baseline for our future halloween plans.

1.) Leave early from work 2.) Pick up mom, 3.) pick up food. 4.) get home

the ride from my house to mom's was incredibly easy, even with the shutdown bridge I made record time. AT that point, I was like ""so, what do we do for food"" and decided that I'd pick something up. Which turned from McDonalds to ""Hey, that pizza place looks not so busy lets go there.""
Well, looks, as they say, goes before the fall...... or something like that.
B/c, after inisting everyone pick quick, cold-sub type meals, I was astonished to hear ""Ok, that'll be about 35 minutes""

So we chatted a bit at my mom's house, and got home at exactly 6pm. 
With the food.

So we decidd to bring the food with us, which didn't work out horribly, but isn't something that we'll do again.

The rest of the evening went well. We decided to go around our area first. Something we'd not done last year, and something I really wanted to do.. get to know the neighbors and such.

Of course, all my attempts at a good 'sorta' first impression were thrown out the window, when, in trying to scoot my mother's wheelchair by some folks in chairs that were sitting on the sidewalk drinking hot chocolate I managed to 1.) make them both get up 2.) look like an idiot as I continually bumped the chairs with a wheel or two and, for the piece de resistance...3.) knocked over the woman's hot chocolate

They couldn't have been nicer, and we all got a good laugh, but it was one of those ""Why didn't I just turn around and go back the other way around the car like I was going to do?""

So, after that we got into the car and popped by some friends' house who had just moved into the area, just long enough to say 'trick or treat' and 'hi'

The next stop was off to the house where the guy that owns Market Basket lives. It's in Lowell, in the Belvideere section. Which is sorta ritzy. 
This guy can't be nicer though, he goes all out, and that area is always packed with people, who've driven over, just like us.

THey do a picture, have a little walk through garage (that's very kid friendly) and give out a plastic demoulas bag full of candy to everyone that comes through.

My grandmother lives on the other side of that development, which is where we end up for the night, so I'm ok with going over there.

But I must admit, it feels weird seeing that road with cars upon cars parked, and wondering if people do it on purpose, go to the rich area of lowell b/c they know they'll have nicer stuff.

I had the though cross my mind that ""Wasn't this what robin hood did? or are we cutting out the middle man and having the poor go steal from the rich instead.""

I'm sorta shallow in thinking like that.
Though I don't necessarily think I""m wrong.

I will say, though, something that didn't occur to me, seriuously, until just now, is that maybe the people aren't trick or treating in the area where they live, b/c it's not safe.

I know our area sorta borders some neighborhoods where there's some gang activity (like where they live, not necessarily where stuff happens...)

So anyway, my grandmother was happy to see us. My aunt is living with her now, and she had some fun playing with Jonathan while I got caught up on all things ""Welcome"" (their family name, and my mnther's maiden name)

I realized that I'm still anxious and stressed when it comes to holidays. Even Halloween I was feeling rushed from the get go-- and it never really stopped until I dropped my mother off and we had a chance to talk.

With thanksgiving and christmas coming up, we're starting to make plans... I think I'll need to remind myself to slow the heck down and enjoy this."

Looking at a recent issue of 'Relevant' magazine, I came across an article that talked about one of the most interesting debates inside christianity. If you like that kind of thing.

Who will be *saved? *(IE from the fiery pit of hell.... again, if you subscribe to that kind of thing)

1.) Some think there's one path, through Jesus, that there's no other way to God. Period.
2.) Others think that as long as you live a life that parallels Jesus', even if you don't ever say ""Jesus is my Lord and Personal savior and He is my true salvation, I am a sinner and He is my Savior. (or something to that affect)""..........you're in.

There may be others that do not fall into one of the 2 categories above. (There are some in category 1 that think that we can lose our salvation, and others that think that we cannot...I'll not be talking about this here... but I tend to not think we can lose our salvation.)

So, for some reason, I'm thinking about this... really thinking about it. For some reason completely going from a ""yes, those are definitely 2 schools of thought"" frame of mind to a ""You. Must. Decide. Right. Now."" 

The first thing I did is take what I knew about God, and put this decision in context.

He is a Jealous God. He's got things under his belt like ""The Flood"".
He let Adam and Eve make their own decisions... thus letting Evil in the world, thus allowing Satan the keys to this world. 

He is all-knowing, so He knew this would happen.

There are verses in the Bible about Him being a fair and a just God, which I agree with... however this world? Fair? Just? Yeah, not so much.
This, for some reason, makes me think #1 is right. Some of us will go to heaven, some of us will not. And, for all eternity... very hot... teeth gnashing... not fun... yadda yadda.

That sounds a lot like Old Testament God to me. 
The truth is that Old Testament God IS New Testament God. It's the same Guy. 
But the rules have changed a bit, haven't they.
He's changed leagues... he has to worry about the DH, and no longer has to worry about the double-switch and having an automatic out at the bottom of the lineup (unless he manages the Royals).

So, HE may be the same, but WE are not. It's different. It's gone from ""Know these 4000 rules, and obey them."" to ""Umm.. ok, see these 2 right here? *circles them with red pen* Just know those TWO, OK?""

So I can see him laying down the law, and opening up a can of whoop@ss... but.. on His People?
His.  People.

<i>His.</i> People.

No. I think, (and book of Revelation, tell me if I'm wrong), those people will suffer for a bit (and the bit will feel like a very long time), but only until He gets to the source. 

And, in that final battle... it's not going to be long, drawn out Michael Bay inspired 1/2 hour to an hour final battle scene, where God just barely stops the bomb from hitting zero, blows up the asteroid in the nick of time, or He <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112442/"">races Satan on a runway, to make the firewall that only fits one car, and Satan's car crashes, only Satan survives, to take a last shot at God, only Jesus shoots him in the nick of time. </a>

Nope.

It's going to be. 
'Ok. Game Over. Time to start eternity. '

Now, I'm sure you have the same question on that as I do.
Why wait?
If He can do that, and make it so no more crazy happens. No more children die. No more abuse. No more pain. No more killing in His name. No more abuse in His name.
What's the friggen hold up?

I suppose He's not ready yet. There's more story to tell. We're only just hearing that the world needs to be saved, and it's only us that can do it. 
Us. As a group. Not ""I"". 
Us.

See, I know (parts of) God. 
I don't know ALL of God, but I know enough to know that He loves His people.
Like you wouldn't believe. As much as He loves His Son.
Moreso, some would argue.

So #2 makes sense.
I picture God going to the murderer. One who raped them, killed them, and then raped them again. One who spit on them, and laughed in their families faces.

#1 sounds too black and white. It's not really exactly 'knee-jerk', but it's sortof us trying to make heads or tails of it.
We make a decision (send him to die or life in prison) and say ""Well, that's over and done with."")

But I can see Him going to this guy, and then God telling everyone about the life he lead, about his parents, about his parent's parents. About how his father's father was an orphan b/c someone had murdered his family. 
God knows the big picture. I do not.

See, that just sounds like God to me. Grace. Mercy. Compassion.
Crazy Grace. <i>Crazy</i> Grace.

Does that mean we sin with no repurcussions? No. Sin separates us from God.
This is not good. In this world, we need all the connection we can get.

Some reason I think this next thing is relavant:

Today I watched my son, and a 5 year old girl chase a butterfly. 
I happen to open the window of my 2nd floor 'office' at home, and had about the best view you can ask for.

I saw them see it. The 5 year old girl's giggles when she first saw it, and hearing her use the world 'beautiful' overwhelmed my 'please don't let this moment end' sensor.

Time stopped for me, as the butterfly swooped up and down, and they chased it.
I could look straight down and into both of their eyes.

It landed on the seesaw, and they approached it carefully.
Carefully until my 2 year old son couldn't contain himself anymore and screeched with delight... thus scaring the bejesus out of the thing, and it climbed straight up, seemingly deciding that the air show was over. 
But it came back, just for a bit, then just had enough and took off down the street, where other kids, that had gathered to watch it, chased after it.

So why is God waiting for the perfect moment? No clue.
Is it so we can experience moments like this, thus showing us how much He loves us?
If that's the case, what about the painful moments?

So, while I wouldn't be surprised at #1, I'm expecting it to be more like #2.

Ok.. I would be a bit surprised by #1. I'd even be more suprised if I ended up in the ocean of fire and 'lost my salvation' b/c of this post. ;)</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Click here for late night ramblings about music"">This will be the first post in the series I'll call ""Songs I can't stop listening to.""

What's been happening lately, is that I get a verse or lyric in my head from a song, it'll stay with me for days, and then I'll have to seek out the song and listen to it. Then I'll listen to it again and again until I suck all the 'musicness' from it.

For at least a week and a half, I woke up each morning with ""The world is a vampire"" going through my head... 
Not the entire song, just the opening lyric.

It was like hearing the whole ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shave_and_a_Haircut"">Shave and a haircut</a>"" thing, and then slowly dying b/c they never did the double-knock ""two bits' at the end.

I can't tell you the satisfaction I got from spending the $1 on iTunes and finally hearing the drums and bass kick in.
Not to mention, what I was <i>really</i> waiting for: ""Despite all my rage, I am <i>still</i> just a rat in a cage.""

See, Billy Corgan (and company, I assume) did a cover of  'Landslide', and I heard it, and for some reason it made me want to hear ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings"" something fierce. He did ok with 'Landslide', but I wanted to hear his voice where it belonged, in the midst of 'wall of sound' distortion.

The first time that something like this happened, where I NEEDED to hear a song again was when I heard Foo Fighter's ""Let it Die"" on the radio.
It's been a long, long time since I had the stereo cranked up that loud. 
Eventually, I bought the CD on iTunes. 
I remember it was in the CDPlayer in the car, (after going from house to burned CD to car to work, and back to car......when's the last time a CD made THAT journey... where you were like ""Ok, I'm going to the bathroom... is there a CD player in there?"") and my wife was like ""Is he screaming?""
Me: Yup
Her: I didn't know you liked music where people scream.
Me: Well, not all the time, just the important parts.

Or something to that effect.

So, a year late, I got on the 'Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace"" bandwagon, and decided it was the best album EVAR!!1ONE
It was one of those things where you buy it for one song, and when all is said and done, your top 5 songs on the album don't include the one you bought it for. 

The thing I'm struggling with (b/c I can't just allow myself to love something and be done with it), is that, so far, it appears to be I'm drawn to the 'music' (as opposed to the lyrics). 
Not that I don't think that ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings"" or ""Let it Die"" don't have lyrics that are thoughtful, and well crafted, I do.
In fact, I'm generally in awe of people who can put a few words together, make it not sound completely unbalanced, and still make sense ('Closing Time' not withstanding [ I mean COME ON ""<i>Time for you to go out to the places you will be from</i>"" ... really..........<i>REALLY?<font color=""#800000"">**</font></i>)

For example, I don't know what Bullet with butterfly wings are, what it's supposed to stand for.

I just googled it to find out what it means from ""www.songmeaning.com"", and apparently, hang on to your hats as I drop some real deep stuff on you... the whole rat in the cage bit means he feels he's ... TRAPPED.

like a rat. In a cage.

Gee, thanks.

I mean I get the overall jist, 'noone likes me, noone listens to me, the world is sucking me dry and not giving me anything back'
But I don't listen to it to hear the words.

I listen to it b/c I think Corgan's voice with the music is awesome, the dynamics are awesome, and it's fun.
And, you know, the Electric Guitar sounds awesome.*

<font size=""-2"">*This is why I could never review music. It'd either be Awesome, ok, or not awesome. Breaking down music to it's 'bits and bytes' or 'notes and rests' can make it sound pretty dumb unless you know how to do it well.</font>

To further explain my point, there's this song on ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_of_the_Beaconsfield_Miners"">Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace</a>"" called 'But Honestly""
It's a Paul song. Paul songs start out quiet, and then hit their climax, and get really really loud.
Sometimes they come back down, not always.

So 'But Honestly' starts out all acoustic-y and nice, and all:
""Where you off to with that head of yours?
Is there somewhere you should be?
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you, it's only me? Maybe""

See, and you're like ""Ok, if someone 18 years old was singing this, we wouldn't be able to take it seriously, like 'what does he know about this stuff"" But it's Dave Grohl, so you're like, OK, where is this going?""

And then he drops this lyric:
""And tonight I thank the stars; as I count my lucky scars.""

And the first time I heard that, I wanted to pour paint thinner in my ears and follow it up with those brain eating worm things that are in all the medieval movies.

But it grew on me, and I started thinking about it*, and getting it, and appreciating what he was trying to say.

<font size=""-2"">*Ok, real quick.
So I'm in 'group' the other day, and we're talking about real deep stuff, getting to the nitty gritty; 
And someone says something, my mind takes a detour, and I almost bust out laughing.
So one of the guys says, ""I'm talking to my wife the other day, I'm on my way out to the store and she said something that really got me thinking..""
<b>And right HERE my mind goes, ""She said 'Get some eggs, and bread, and some milk.......' I couldn't believe how right she was.</b>
I have NO idea what he said after that, b/c I was WAY too busy trying not to laugh my @ss off.
I wish life was a sitcom.</font>

Anyway
So then it's :
""And all the words I gave to you; Something borrowed, something blue"" (yeah, I know, bear with me)
""If you want them back; I'll give it to you""
""Give it to you; Give it to you; Give it to you""

And then they're like ""ok, dude, your guitar solo goes right ...HERE.""
And it's not really a technically hard solo, in fact, I bet, with a bit of time on my hands, I could learn to play it just a tad slower and only missing a note or 2 in a few weeks.
But it just FITS. Perfectly. Like if Satriani, or Clapton, or Steve Vai ....or..... ok, no Clapton would be ok, that's just sacrilidge... but you get my point.
Anyone else tries to go all ""Surfing with the Alien' there, it just doesn't work.

I think what I""m trying to say is....... I really really really really really really really like music.

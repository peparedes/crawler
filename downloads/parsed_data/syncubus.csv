"event","Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am up to my asshole in barely concealed FEAR.&nbsp; Let me make this clear to you all.&nbsp; I am clenching and shaking with both anticipation and nervousness.

I have met my worst enemy, and she has challenged me to a game of chess, and a gentlemanly game of it that I'm not sure I'm up for.&nbsp; She is a minister that I'm fond of on a friendship level.&nbsp; I don't want to offend her, and I certainly don't want to offend her congregation, but I still want to be definitive and positive with what I say.&nbsp; However, I am speaking in a church, which I have little respect for the teachings of, other than the simple respect for the 'goodliness' of it all.

I am an atheist, (I'm an ordained reverend and whatnot, capitalize 'atheist or 'reverend' if you need a title or whatever.&nbsp; I'm not particular) and as devout and pure and as clean of soul as any atheist can be, and I have been invited to talk to an actual church congregation about atheism!&nbsp; I mean shit!&nbsp; Baptist?&nbsp; Mennonite?&nbsp; Neither of which I know a whole lot about, or how they differ.&nbsp; Test of bloody courage in the slanderous eyes of your not-quite peers?&nbsp; I want to describe the ways that ""atheists aren't 'evil"".&nbsp; That is the intent of it, anyway.&nbsp; But you can't get a more dismissive,&nbsp; tougher audience, and I'm no public speaker!&nbsp; I have stage fright at picturing the the first word.&nbsp;"

"event","I write the words of a god in a language no man can read.
I author fables and tales so complex to be indecipherable,
yet so childishly simple.  
They branch and grow and recurse in a lively dance
and crescendo to to the same towering end.
True or false, pass or fail.

It's the journey that is truly wonderful in my stories.
Yet no person ever takes that journey.  
No person ever sees the sights along the way.
No person appreciates the elegance of the plot.
The outcome is always the same, uninteresting.
I am an invalid artist."

"event","I think of you sleeping in my arms.  
Feeling you move against me.
Sleeping.
Just stirring.
Restless.
yet resting with me, quietly.
Trusting.

Your soft sighs of remembering me mixed with your thoughts in sleep.
Feeling your movements and wondering what you must be thinking.
What your dreams are made of.
Who you really are.
Why you care so much.
Admiring you for learning still, while you sleep with me.

I dare not move to wake you.  
I'm careful.
holding you.
Just being with you.
feeling your body against my chest.
Your breaths swell against me.
Tiny noises I hang on.
Just listening to you.
Just being with you.

I count the minutes watching the clock across your soft shoulders.
In the darkness.
Illuminating you.
Waiting for it to count down the moments.
Until I can kiss you awake.
My arm is numb beneath you
I bear it.
I bear your sleep
I bear your breath whispering to me.
The smell of your hair
the scent of your skin.
The sound of your breath as you inhale
pushing me slightly away
and relaxing to let me fall back against you.
The heat of your skin against mine.
Warm and comforting.

I move my arm to nestle between your breasts.
To hold your chest in my hand.
Softly, I pull you to me.
A gentle hug.
and you stir against me.
Wondering.
Listening.
Your eyes still closed, I kiss you good morning.
softly.
and hold you to me.
very close."

People ask if I'm excited and don't get me wrong I am... but I'm wondering if this is why people started to take time off and go somewhere for a honeymoon!?!  By the time everything is done you both feel as if you are going to loose your minds. 

Work is going well... can't complain and I won't.  I don't know exactly what I'm doing from day to day and my boss decided that I'm a pretty good ""quick change artist""... that can be taken a couple of different ways... I'm going to translate it to ""Jack of all trades"" and take it as a compliment.  

A few people still insist on causing drama, or trying.  That's the nice thing about being  so damn busy lately.  I don't have time to pay much attention and my give a damn is broke... 

Busy, busy, busy... I'll be able to pretend that I'm social soon... I hope :)"

""All Is Numb""

C'mon drift away through fundamental boundaries
To find ourselves surrounding
The ones who've already gone and come back stronger

All is numb
I've been lost too long
My fate's been mistakenly chosen
All is numb
Yeah I've done you wrong
My fate's been mistakenly chosen

Here you'll stay
Where lies are spread wide open
And ties are not so strong
That place you'll never find me
I've already gone

I guess my thinking too much is what's been f*&%$n' me up
It's my own worst enemy, but
It will never own me...
Who am I kidding anyway?

But I wish that communication were not such a foreign concept... If it's important in your life why then aren't you sharing it... or is it that so many of us want to go through the pain of the land of ice and snow alone? 
(if you wanted an optimistic letter from me, now is not the time to expect one from me) So here I sit once again, and my bed will remain empty once again for I can't sleep and there is no point in it anyway, it just makes things harder to get done since... well you can't really do much in your sleep... and ... stuff...

To those who are enjoying the holidays, I hope that all goes well and that they will definitely be merry and bright. As for the rest of us, I hope that it gets better as the world freezes and takes a break from the rush of life in the fast lane and the growth that is attempted when the world thaws...

"event","Well the good news is, I am offically divorced!!! Yeah!!! 

The bad news is... I am not working at the moment, going through the damn grieving process AGAIN... and trying to get through it as quickly as possible so that I can get on with my life after the long and slow tortured death that has finally come to the biggest mistake in my life... getting married to that p.o.s.... 
<lj-cut>
Note: slightly pessimistic at the moment, so take this with a grain of salt. 

So my biggest puzzle as of late is... trying to get through school. I realize that I do not have the stamina of some of my stronger friends to push it to the limit for long periods of time and still have bills to pay... the rock and the hard place is exactly... going to school full time so that I can make good money, have a good life and tell my ex where to shove it... :P Problem... I don't seem to be doing well with a full time job and school at the same time... 4 hours of sleep doesn't seem to cut it... but I still have bills to pay (don't we all!?!) and can't not work while I go to school... *damn!*  The only conclusion that I have been able to come to thus far is *drumroll* suck it up, get a part-time job and live broke while I pay bills, get smart, and a piece of paper that says that I am smart so that I get a kick a** job and hopefully make all of the bill collectors happy so that I can move on with my life without my concious telling me that I am not working hard enough...   

(when I said mental vomit... I wasn't kidding :D)

On a lighter note... I hope that everyone is doing well and wish the best to those that I love.

when it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass

and would he be stronger than his father
don't punish yourself, leave it well alone

There only seems to be one problem... He's no where to be found....(shock, shock).  So now, I am going to go get yet another copy of an almost 100 page document (I'm sure most of you already know, but I'm venting, bear with me), drive all the way down to Springville, and try to track him down again, stuff him into the car (I'll even try to be nice about it), and drag him down to file the paperwork... That is if he is not hiding.

Either way, if things go well or not, tonight is going to be great!!!.

I'm taking an online class since I've already taken the other class that they are offereing and don't want to waste my time and money by taking it again... although a refresher course would be nice. Oh well, I need the credits and retaking classes won't give me that.

You seem to naturally know a lot about parenting, and you know what kids need.
You can tell when it's time to let kids off the hook, and when it's time to lay down the law.
While your parenting is modern and hip, it's not over the top.
You know that there's nothing cool about a parent who acts like a teenager... or a drill sergeant!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/wouldyoubeacoolparentquiz/"">Would You Be a Cool Parent?</a></div>"

I have been in bed for the past four days, missed two days of work and two days of school. My only hope is that my teacher will let me make up the final since I've been so damn sick. 
It takes quite a bit for me to start camping in the dinning room for days on end. 
I'm hoping that I am starting to get over this, but it's hard to say, I was doing great for a day and then I went to work and got the fever back... 
I'll get over it eventually. 
I've just been really grumpy and I know that if I start taking cold medicine to get through work, I'll be fine for a bit, then I will crash hard. Don't want to do that. 
On another note, I miss my sweetie... :( You got me sick so come a take care of me damnit!!!

Now that I've whined, everyone have a good day/night.

This storm to weather, 
Founding doubtful rumination, 
Wondering if the wake will end, 
Dreams are only a parting friend,   

To one I call and all else forsake, 
Or is it I, who must break, 
The clouds clear for a moment in time, 
I remember the wonders that one could find. 

The sky is grey, the clouds recondite, 
When will they then, go to resign, 
Hand in hand, and heart in heart, 
To walk the land storms do depart...

Where every step should be sure,

<lj-cut>

So, it gets to a point that I realise that all is calm as long as I keep my mouth shut and do not bring up any inquiry of wrongdoing towards me or any argument to the effect that I have been wronged in the slightest. I do, and suddenly, I am to explain the definition of every word that was said and nothing of the real point is addressed. And when I do try to bring the actual point back up, I get another reason that I am not understood because I didn't use exactly the correct wording to convey my thoughts and emotions. Never mind the fact that it seems to be the prefered vehicle to argue the point into anothers favor instead of asking why I feel this way.... I don't know. 

Maybe one day my voice will be heard instead of just endured. I have concerns too, but I don't believe that they are being taken seriously or addressed. 

So ends another wonderful night with a petty banter that could have been avoided if I had known to  not turn on the radio at that paticular point in time. Nevermind that I can't read minds.... still trying but... nope, still can't. (yes, I'm getting a little petty myself... venting). 

Have a lot of things to do tomorrow.... and I still can't sleep, never really can when the dogs of war come out to play and I seem like I'm in the loosing pack.  The war is over and I am not the enemy!!!! Maybe one day I can be heard over the din of the battlefield... 

Another night, and another day to try once again. And to get one more thing done to ensure my eventual freedom from my own past..."

"event","Can't really sleep, and now that some of the past is out somewhere... I don't know if anyone really considers this paper... :T

<lj-cut>

I know that the state of the heart can blind absolutely. Being that I am trying to live day by day at this point in my life... I hope that I can do better than yesterday. 
I have started to put myself back together, remembering the things that I want to accomplish, the little things that make me and others smile, in all affects, the little things in life. 
This life will ever be exactly the way that I expect it to be, but that doesn't mean that I have to loose me...

I'm starting school again in Feb, this being one of the goals that have been put off due to a lot of circumstances within and without my control. 
I just keep remembering that the degree is mine to hold and be proud of if I can only but work towards this day by day. 

Sometimes I wonder if I have done something in some past life to make it so that many of those around me seem to achieve their goals with little or no effort. 
Every step that I take, even through the next looks clear, as soon as I get close to it, another metephorical boulder is dropped in my path... 

I just keep thinking that if I take a step or two every day that eventually I will reach the things that will make me a happy person, and maybe I can find that happy person before I even reach the summit... maybe I just need to learn a few things... 

Someone said that to know what happiness truly is, you must know misery and pain. 
The only thing that I don't like about this fact is, once you know how happy you can truly be, the void of pain and misery cuts that much deeper because you know exactly what you are missing. 

It is a strange thing having little regrets in life. Some think that pain is a byproduct of regret... I don't think so. I believe that it is much more complicated than this. 
I regret very little in my life and there are only a couple of things that I would change if I could... then again I'm not so sure that I would. 

I regret only one thing that I could have changed in the past 2 1/2 years. I shoulda, coulda woulda spoke my heart sooner. Much of the pain, and tears ""may"" have been saved for saying three words a couple of weeks sooner.. then again maybe not. 

The art of the unknown can be very tricky and unstable in the hands of the wrong person... maybe this is why it is so difficult to learn and most of all understand. The smallest change in anything can change everything... and nothing all at the same time. 

I have seen the effects of these gifts abused by those who took the easy path, and I wonder if they even knew where these choices would lead everyone. I don't think the untrained, or uncarring mind has a clue to the aftermath even when they are living in it. Life can be so much more with a better understanding of self and then the world around. Most often we loose something when we try to play the adult role and don't fully understand the implications. I know that I still don't understand a lot of everything. 

I think that it may be time to start studying myself again... I have lost many things in my life in recent years, and I think in this I may have lost sight of myself as well. I remember being the sage beyond my years some time ago... and honestly... I miss it very much. Many things in life didn't nessaraly make sense, but I handled them much better and learned much more from my mistakes. 

Or maybe I just had teenitis....:D I ""thought"" that I knew everything... *shrug*
Either way, I'm not going to get anywhere just standing here, now am I???"

<lj-cut>

No I haven't really been myself for a very long time now. 
I allowed my heart to hope, and that hope was shattered. 
And even after this, I continued to hope, I just wonder if the token that I gave during an exchange of heart means anything to the one that I gave my heart to... I see it every few months or so. I only take mine off when I have to. Maybe I'm wrong. 
Call me weird or symbolic, but it is part of who I am. 
After the ""official"" agreements were made, I still felt like I was playing second fiddle to one who wanted nothing more than to destroy everything that she professed to love. 
And I continued to pay for the things that I didn't do. 
I accepted this and kept trying. 
Then I got pushed even farther away, because heaven forbid that I actually get hurt in any of this and want some semblance of understanding and sympathy from the one I have been paying for to love. 
Eventually, slipped into a deep depression... which just makes everything worse since now I'm not the happy go luck person that he thought I was. Of course I'm not, I'm broken by your hand and you don't seem to understand that I paid a much larger price of the heart than I ever let you know.  Maybe I should have, but what difference would it make, you wouldn't hear me at the time even if I screamed, begged, or cried. 

So now, I slowly trek out of my abyss, praying that finally, I can stop wondering if it is all over, or if I will continue to fade into the background no matter what I do. 
At first I felt like I belonged, free, happy, and complete in the midst of chaos. 

Now, I wonder if my voice is heard, listened to, or even acknowledged. I know that after so long of trying to go the extra mile, forget everything and move on, it gets harder and harder when you are not allowed to outlive and create a new day... I think this goes for both of us. 

The real confession is, no I haven't been trying lately, I haven't for a couple of months. I don't want to be ignored, snapped at, or pushed away any time I try anymore. I am trying so hard to be the culprit of such things myself, but I am not perfect either. 

I miss my best friend...

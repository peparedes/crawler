"event","So...found my livejournal <b>again</b>!  So I decided to bitch and moan to it...but 1st I got some great news.  I got a girlfriend!!!  Her name is Sara and she's great.  I've known her for years, she lives across the street from my Aunt Missys and she comes up to the mountain every weekend with the rest of the people I know.  She's awsome, i love it.  ;]

So about today, such a long day at work.  Problems everywhere, problems with the printers, problems with the boxes, problems with the sleeves, problems with the temperature of the egg, problems with the employees that just keep on talking...problems with everything!  Got a small headache, my neck is killing me, my arm that sara slept on is killing me (not complaining that she slept on it but that shes not here to rub it  -.-  ), ate too much candy last night so my jaw is hurting from all that chewing...I'm gonna stop complaining now."

"event","ok well, i didn't post all weekend so imma post today <b>about</b> my weekend.  Well saturday was kinda gay but then i was hapy near the end.  I sat home 1/2 the day doing nothing then I decided to call Jacqui to see what she was up to.  She told me she was going to go shopping and asked me if I wanted to join, of course I said 'yes'.  So I went upstairs to put my shoes on and Bill like fucking flipped out on me about not having a job and he swears im not lookin, which is BULLSHIT. So we argued back and forth for a while and he basically told me that I had till October 1st to get a job or im out of the house.  Around that time jacqui knocked on the door and came inside to hear the end of the argument. So we went shopping ahd we both had a good time, SHE WANTS JEANS BUT DOESNT LIKE ANY THAT FIT HER!!!  Girls are so hard to deal with.  ;x   just kidding  ;]    Then we went back to my house and she stayed here for like 10 minutes and left.  My rents wernt home when we came to my house so i was happy, so i sat around and chilled.  Chris said he was going to come over for a little bit, so he came over for like an hour at the max and he left.  So i was again bored so i called mimmo at like 9:30 and said come over we are ordering chinese.  So we did just that, and he left at 10:30....AGAIN I WAS BORED!  So i sat around and did nothing...called my baby mary ellen and i think i fell asleep on the phone.  ok next post is sundays.."

<br>More About You Cancer... 

Cancer, you are a born pleaser. Few people can resist your passionate, playful allure. An incurable romantic, you adore being courted. You'll do anything for a lover that sends you flowers or love tokens. 

You like lots of cuddling, touching, and kissing. You are a celebrated kisser. You also like to touch and fondle yourself. Typically, you learned to give yourself pleasure at a very young age. As an adult, you are easily aroused and multi-orgasmic. Mutual masturbation is very satisfying for you. 

You are extremely aware of your sexual attraction. You telegraph your sensuality with every move you make. You have the most communicative body language of any sign. 

You are very emotional, and you constantly need an emotional outlet. Frequent sex seems to calm you down. But you are old fashioned, and a quickie is not your style. You prefer long, slow seductions, erotic masasages, and lots of oral sex"

"event","Well today is boring...but i did do a couple things.  I woke up mad early and tried to call Jor for a job, of course he didn't answer so I left another message (again).

Then I decided to sleep a little more, so I took like a 2 hour nap, if it even lasted that long. So I got up and came on the computer and fucked around for a while, chatting with meta and some other friends.  Watched the movie ""hackers"" while chatting.  Nothing really interesting, so blah.

Then i realized i was hungry so i decided to cook myself some food, while i was cooking i realized i had NO MILK so i got really mad and i came back to my computer.  I noticed kenny was on so i im'ed him ina  fury to gain some milk from him.  he said come over with a cup and his mother would give me a cup.  So i rushed over to his house in my b-ball shorts and a yellow t-shirt (without knowing it was raining  outside) so i ran to my car and stepped in a HUGE puddle and got soaked.  I made it over to kenny's house and got the milk.  And i continued to make my food.  

So i poped in the movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (which is almost over).  Sober warned me a couple times and and some fun.  thats just about it for now..hopefully if im in the mood ill post the rest of my day.

Cant wait to see jacqui ;D

"event","Hey I guess I should update since it has been like who knows how long.
   My job is going great.I am becoming better and better everyday I would say,by just watching ppl and getting to know how everything works helps a whole lot.I am still kind of scared to be on the floor though,its kinda like hair school but your making money.I get all flustered when i think about the new salon opening because i knw i will have a station.I am only scared about messing someones hair up and i dont want to do that.I also can not wait till my New York classes at Redken.I am so excited about that and i know I will learn a lot up there as well.
  I am still kinda upset that i have not found someone to date.I know I am very picky VERY and its like no one is right for me.I will like someone and then one thing will make me not like them or they are still envolved with liking there ex boyfriend.UGH.i met this guy last week and i was trying to not throw up he was so gross.I really do not know.i guess when he comes i will know.
 My brother is having his senior prom this friday and i am doing his dates hair.I think they go out but not sure,she is super cute.I am giving her some weave and going to make her hot.NOt that i did his ex girlfriends hair on saturday because her stylist cancelled on her,but i gave her this kick ass updo and she got prom queen.AND all these ppl were like who did your hair it looks good,so maybe that will give me some clients for prom next year.
 I think I might move out again.LOL.on friday when we went out for Adams birthday I ran into this girl i knew a while back and we have been talking and she said i could move in with her.but i dont know if she is for real or not but you never know?I am going over there tomorrow and going to see the house and see if i really want to or not i just really want to get out of my house at home....for some odd reason i guess someone put a spell on me b/c i am like a homebody now...i dont like to realy talk to anyone or hang out or anything,i go out to Play and am tired after 2 hours and i feel like an old ass man like im 80 or something.who knows?
 Anyways I am going to Penscola for gay pride I am excited about that since i have never been and also because i get to go to the beach which i have not seen in about 2 years.well i am tred hope everyone has a great night

ANYWAYS....i am also sick and tired of PLAY already, i dont know why but when i was 18 i could stay out all night..now having a career is not letting me do this.i dont know.its kinda sad but oh well..

  Today sucked..I went to go look at cars and turns out I can get one but not a new one.I was looking at this bad ass honda civic 02 and it was a good deal well,my insurance for 6 months would end up being $4000.what the fuck,and that was under my parents so needless to say if i do get a car its not going to be new.
  Work is fantastic...i love it i  can not believe i am actually working in a salon.It is so much fun.The people there are really cool too.Ijust can not wait till i have to take my state board tests.I am still at Pier one and managing to work both jobs right now just for the money,so far it is going ok.
  On to other things....I have a question..If you are a bottom and you find someeone attractive and you all have fun and enjoy each other...and you really like this person.does it matter if he is also a bottom...?
Talk to you all later,

   Halloween was so much fun...if anyone was wondering were was after the second show I was talking to this guy (the hot roman) well he is a wonderful guy. I was kind of scared to talk to him because i didnt know what to say but i finally just went for it and it turned out fine.We ended up talking for about an hour and a half and then i gave him my number and wished for him to call me because i didnt have my phone in the club so i took my chance and waited...Well he calledon Monday evening and we talked for a while then we hung out yesterday like all day.We went out to eat at Raffertys then we went to see SAW (I DONT RECOMMEND IT)then we went back to Belmont were he attends school and we watched Dawn of the Dead which was gory as hell but not to scarry then it was still kind od early so we walked around campus were studends were watching the election and things like that.Most of them are republicians which didnt suprise me since it is a very Baptist school,I was kind of suprissed to seee some democrats though.... Belmont is a really nice school and very big,I never got the college life so it was very fun to see.......But anyways the club was really fun the other night and  i really liked all you guys costumes that dressed up.I am glad I got to spend Halloween with all of you. Maybe next year I can dress up a little more.Well Ross is away for a week on vacation in Mexico so i wount be able to see him which is kinda good cause i am sick at the moment ...weather,but i have a feeling about this one and i predict something good..I just hope i am right.
     Have an interview tomorrow at Studio Gaven which is going to  so go well more than likely so i hope i get it ...wish me luck and talk to you all later.

 i am still going to school and doing very well of course. i have been doing hair like it is a drug i have to have my hands in someones hair or i will freaking get an attitude.Even since i did my managers hair i have been offered to do a lot more clients than i thought.i guess for every one persons hair you do its like 5 more clients.i can not wait for the Atlanta hair show in august just because i am going to see some out of this world shit.
 I have been seeing someone too.well at least hanging out for that matter,and it seems to be going well i cant tell still.he is a wonderful person and treats me very good but i just dont know how to tell if he wants to be more than just friends.I was with him all weekend and he took me out but i just dont know.i mean if you spend your money on someone and they say we are just friends is that really just friendship?i mean i dont pay for my friends all the time let alone i dont say lets go eat in cool springs at an expensive resturant. I am getting my hopes up for nothing and it sucks because i really dont know how he fells..<ugh>
 well i am sorry everyone if i have not been hanging out recently just for the simple fact of me trying to get through school and as i am reading can tell i am not missing much.its funny how i have sooo many friends when i hang out with them but they never call me and ask hey whats going on or wanna go out.i mean there are a few but they are straight.thats really wierd.i dont care though. i really only have girlfriends anyways and the guy friends i do have are only my friend when they are bored or something.

 I recently got tested at pride for a couple things and have been scared about it like most people,but i am fine now that i know i am negative.it was scarring the shit out of me.
  I started my new job at the tanning bed last night and it was cute,unfortunaly it was the only night b/c the district manager came in and said to let a couple of people go because they were over staffed.So when that becomes available i am the first to get it.YAH!
  I went to school today and yesterday so i am proud .i hope i can keep going just because i am so close to being through,and the girls at school are getting mad that i am not going because i am the only guy on the floor for them t talk to.I am really excited about my skills now too....i did a color correction today at school that took forever and then i did a cut when i got home..(DO I EVEN NEED A JOB)
  Well I so can not wait until sunday rolls aound b/c i am going to be at talent night and so many girls from school are wanting to go its kinda scarry just b/c i didnt think they would be interested.So i can not wait for that.well i am off to watch movies

         I can not believe its almost April,meaning a year ago i alomst graduated.I feel like i havent accomplished a lot in a year other than making new friends and keeping coontact with the old ones.
I can say I am really glad i am in hair school thoughand it is going wonderful as alot of people can tell.
LOL i ate lunch with Zac today and it was fun we were talking about lots of stuff and i realized that a lot of my friends hang out with each other on the weekdays and i really hate it that i work 6 out of 7 days a week because i would like to hang out with my friends too instead of haing to book them in my appointment book lol.well i am going nite nite

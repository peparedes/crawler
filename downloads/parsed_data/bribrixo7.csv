Ooh, now let's get down tonight 
Baby I'm hot just like an oven 
I need some lovin' 
And baby, I can't hold it much longer 
It's getting stronger and stronger 
And when I get that feeling 
I want Sexual Healing 
Sexual Healing, oh baby 
Makes me feel so fine 
Helps to relieve my mind 
Sexual Healing baby, is good for me 
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me 
Whenever blue tear drops are falling 
And my emotional stability is leaving me 
There is something I can do 
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and 
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me 
The love you give to me will free me 

 
  
 
If you don't know the things you're dealing 
I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing 
Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up, let's make love tonight 
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 'cos you do it right 
Baby I got sick this morning 
A sea was storming inside of me 
Baby I think I'm capsizing 
The waves are rising and rising 
And when I get that feeling 
I want Sexual Healing 
Sexual Healing is good for me 
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush 
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us 
Sexual Healing, baby, is good for me 
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me 
And it's good for me and it's good to me 
My baby ohhh 
Come take control, just grab a hold 
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it 
Honey, oh we're feeling fine 
You're my medicine open up and let me in 
Darling, you're so great 
I can't wait for you to operate 
I can't wait for you to operate 
When I get this feeling, I need Sexual Healing"

"event","I want a boy.
A nice and bad boy.
He'll tell me we're like Corey and Topanga.
He'll give me his favorite sweatshirt.
He'll call me at 3am and ask me what i'm doing.
He'll tell me he couldn't fall asleep because he was thinking about me, and he needed to hear my voice.
He'll text me every morning before school saying ""Have a great day babe I love you!"".
And he always whispers something sweet in my ear.
He'll take me to a concert to see his favorite band.
And he wont get embarrassed to tell me he loves me in front of his friends.
When I cry he'll tell me I'm too beautiful to and he'll kiss every tear.
He'll always make me feel better because he knows the perfect things to say to me.
All of his friends will know we're in love because he'll talk about me to them.
He'll stay up with me all night when im sick.
When we're walking together he'll stop and pick up a flower and put it behind my ear.
He'll love everything about me and tell me that I'm perfect.
We always end up laughing about silly fights.
We wont get mad for making fun of each other because we crack up at every bit of it.
Even if we're a million years old, butterflies will still go crazy inside of me ... Every time he kisses me.
He'll tell me he'd die without me.
He'll surprise me by bringing me over my favorite food when I'm having a bad day.
He would think I was beautiful if I dressed so crappy it was classy.
he wouldnt be scared to cry in front of me--
--and would hold me when i cry ..
he'll introduce me to his friends as the coolest girl he's ever met.
We would have contests of how far we could spit our gum, or how far we could jump off a swing.
He'll take walks with me in the snow, and we'll catch *snowflakes* on our tongues
He would grab my waist and kiss my neck.
And we'd always take pictures in photo booths.
He'll let me go places with his mom.
We would play tag and not care whos watching. 
We'd kiss in the rain.
And when I hear him speak, I'll fall in love all over again.
I want a boy who can argue over stupid things with me,
and than go totally soft when I got sad and apologize.
I want someone who would lay with me outside under the stars.
Someone who will squirt me with water guns in the house
When we kissed our hips would be pressed together.
I want someone to be there no matter what ... always and forever *

i think i have found the one i have been loOking fOr and that is James <3
i love him so muchh. he is basically everything i have ever wanted.
he loVes me + he shOws me. he would dO anything fOr me. hE is the best!
he treats me awesome + he doesnt make me cry + we get along greatt ..
i dont know what i would dO without him nOw. i love youu baby <33

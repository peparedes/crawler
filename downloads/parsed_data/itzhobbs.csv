"event","This is by far, without a doubt, the worst break from school EVER.&nbsp; EVER.

First draft of my 20-25 page paper on the Decembrists due tuesday, I only need 10-15 pages by then.&nbsp; I have 13 written, but it's going to need some big changes in the next month.&nbsp; A lot of work still to do on it.&nbsp; But between today ad yesterday, I got 13 pages written.&nbsp; more than halfway... but like i said, a lot still to do.&nbsp; 

thursday i spent all day reading the quiet american by graham greene, and then writing a paper on it, which i finished at 4AM.&nbsp; I may have TOTALLY missed the point on the paper, or i may have hit exactly what he wanted me to write about.&nbsp; so... we'll see.&nbsp; Friday i did more research for my other paper.&nbsp; which i've been doing daily for the past week or two now...

Finally tonight, when i finished my 13 pages of writing, you'd think 'im done.&nbsp; no.

i have a small debate paper for international relations due tuesday.&nbsp; I don't even know what i'm supposed to do.&nbsp; at first i thought it was a 500 word limit, but that looks like it's the RESPONSES that are 500 word limits.&nbsp; the class is online, and all assignments get posted online.&nbsp; of the 4 people who posted theirs, two have long, 6 page papers filled with research and quotes everywhere.&nbsp; the other two have three research sources (what he wants), and basically 300 words of their own writing,and then just huge ass quotes.&nbsp; 

i think i'll go with the second way of doing it.&nbsp; this class is such a pain in the ass.&nbsp; i'm hoping to salvage an A, since it really isn't that diffcult.&nbsp; but, i'll probably end up with a B.&nbsp; hopefully no worse.&nbsp; 

Oh, yeah, I also have a huge test on wednesday, that i need to work on.&nbsp; I have to outline NINE essay questions.&nbsp; each outline will probably be a page or two.&nbsp; so, i have to do that between monday and tuesday as well.

and i need to start looking into schools to go to after villanova to get a masters in education.&nbsp; so far i've only really looked into cabrini.&nbsp; but i want to look at west chester, drexel, penn, temple, penn state, and... i think that's it?&nbsp; maybe others.&nbsp; villanova requires so many pre-requisite classes, that i'd need a whole other semester just to be able to enter.&nbsp; hopefully the other schools aren't as strict.&nbsp; 

ugh.&nbsp; 

despite all this work, nothing else has really been going well this weekend either.&nbsp;&nbsp; oh well... 

hahaha.&nbsp; john kruk just said that he's reading ""The Brothers Kouzmanoff""&nbsp; hilarious.&nbsp; to me anyway.

"event","yeah.... those were the days.  i still read it from time to time, but honestly, it's probably been a year since i've posted.  i've had this thing for... 6, 7 years now?  i should go back and read all my old stuff.  

yeah... or probably not.  

sometime.  when i'm bored enough.  or avoiding work, which i'm doing now.

I need to write a 20-25 page paper on the Decembrists (not the band, unfortunately), and at least half of it is due by next tuesday after easter.  i have nothing written, and not nearly enough research actually researched.  just a stack of books.  i can easily bullshit something out for the rough draft.  and i should have enough time to get the paper done.  although one week in april is already shot.

april 13 - New york city - umphreys mcgee
april 16 - phillies v mets
april 18 - allentown - umphreys mcgee
april 22 - new york city - dave matthews and tim reynolds

so, yeah.  but i can still get it done.  

i should go back to working on that.  

in happier news though - baseball starts tonight.  oh baseball, how i missed you.  welcome back.

ooh wow, livejournal now lets you tag entries?  and put a location down.  simply amazing"

"event","So, I was at the phillies game last night with sean and popo.  God is a phillies fan, as we decided.  Literally 10-20 seconds after the top of the fifth inning ended, and the game went official, it started to POUR, DRENCHING RAIN.  The game was called, only being played halfway, phillies won 2-0.  But that's not the story.  The story was the GREATEST CATCH I HAVE EVER SEEN IN PERSON, and possibly the best of the 2006 season.

<img src=""http://enrico.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/aaron_rowand.jpg""/>

Bases loaded.  Two outs.  Floyd pitching poorly.  Nady hits a drive to deep, deep center field, rowand was playing moderately shallow.  and he RUNS, and RUNS, thinking he has a chance at it, the entire ballpark thought it was gone.  He catches the ball literally a foot from the wall, tries to slow down, but ends up going FACE FIRST into the wall.  Unfortunately for him, his nose hit off a metal plate on the wall, and not the padded pole, or the chain fence.  He broke his nose, blood pouring everywhere, suffered several facial lacerations, and was on the ground for a few minutes.

But he made the catch, and saved the game.  My god.  This is a play that will be long remembered.  Click beneath to view it via youtube.

So, arond 8:55, they went into a rain delay.  We were all set to pretty much just leave, when thanks to Matt, Sean found out the Red Sox game was on the jumbotron.  We paid for a game of baseball, and we were going to watch baseball, dammit.  so we took seats under-cover, and watched the sox take the series from the yankees.

Fun time.  Gotta say.  Driving home was a bitch, had to go about 30 on the expressway for a good 10 minutes because the rain was pouring so damn hard.  it was nasty.  but we made it.  

Speaking of driving, i need an oil change, i'm at like 4600 miles since my last one.  monday i'll do that.  now that i'm done with school for the semester, i can do lots of things i haven't been able to get aorund to doing.  Whoo!

"event","Alright... Here's my current complaint. Stupid bitch girls who don't belong at concerts. So here's the idea... You're a guy, in your early 20s, and you hear good things about a band coming to your town, where there's a good chance you can get high/drunk. so... you go to their concert, only halfway caring about the music. you want someone to go with. you ask your girlfriend. she only likes 50 cent, ashlee simpson, pussycat dolls... she doesn't want to see a group of insanely talented musicians who we'l call... Umphreys McGee. So you tell her ""how about you just come with me, it's only $20, and you can get drunk"" ""ok!"" your slut girlfriend replies.

Then you're at the concert. Getting wasted on the balcony. halfway through the second set, during the coolest version of bridgeless, ever, you decide you want to go up front, where the people are who care about the band, and their music. You push your way up front, with your girlfriend, who can't stand up straight, and is trying to dance, but is really just falling into other people, and grabbing asses of random people, like bryan toporek, who wouldn't care if said girl was hot, but in actuality, was kinda fat. so you and your whore girlfriend are dancing, but she's really just falling over, being obnoxious, and grabbing onto people. then... she starts drumming on random people's arms and backs. and being a complete pain in the ass.

so, to shut her up, you start making out with her. 9 feet in front of the band, who you paid $45 to go see for two tickets. The band, who is playing one of their best concerts of 2006, you are
three rows deep in the crowd, dead center, and making out with your girlfriend while grabbing her ass. Why? Because she's an obnoxious bitch who doesn't really want to be there. you're taking up the space of people who DO want to be there, and want to see this band.

My solution: come to the concert - buy your drugs, go home, get drunk, and screw. but don't do it when i'm trying to watch my concert, dammit.

Alright... There's the end of that rant. I actually mixed up two couples i saw at the show on friday - who were both quite obnoxious. I actually high-fived a complete stranger (well, bryan and i swear we recognized him) after the obnoxious couple left.

Thursday nights show lesson was - if you are a 5 foot tall, 250 pound black woman, don't swing your arms around wildly in circles, you may hit me or bryan in the face, and the flailing fat is quite nasty.

In other news... The concerts were amazing. Thursday night was at the 930 club in DC - hajimashite, BAB A O'REILLY, much obliged > cocaine > much oblighed, hurt bird bath >family fued theme >hurt bird bath, AUGUST, got your milk... damn good show. oh, and bryan, our HBB>family fued>HBB was under 20 minutes...

Friday night, it actually got... BETTER. last three songs of the first set Nothing too fancy, higgins, Jessica (allman brothers). Yeah... Not bad. Then started off the second set with Home again and Bridgless. oh yeah, and glory.

And that is my rant, and concert experience of the past weekend. Umphreys Mcgee is good. And i'm seeing them three times in July. Not bad."

and i only ended up taking 1 phillie... lots of philadelphians in the draft, so they were going too early for my taste.  utely's the only one i would have liked to have...

i like my bench/util hitters.  if sean isn't lying, hermedia is a beast.  and i like wilkerson and his ability to play wherever.  middle infield is light, nobody can sub at 2b or ss, but mora can do 3b when the yankees are off...  maybe i'll drop him for a ryan freel or something who can do any inf pos... i'll see how teh season goes.

my pitching staff is solid, i think.  again, going on seans rec for linaro and blanton.  he best not be lying.  and relievers i think i did well enough with by waiting until late..."

"event","So, i had a terrible month of february (and even january) betting.  mostly mid jan to mid feb was terrible.  this past week, i've been going one game over .500 every day i bet.  so, making a little money everyday.

today.  NINE AND ONE.  (9-1)

i had the following correct bets
USF +10, USF +400 ML (suck it georgetown - sorry), washington -2, kansas -5.5, ncst/wake over 68 first half, akron -3.5, va tech +10, cincy -2.5.  wanted to play UNC+7 too... but, didn't, oh well, it's ok.  i did NOT see duke llsing tonight.  2 in a row.  1 at home.  on senior night.  did not see a loss.  but, i saw a close game, and wanted to put money on UNC +7.  it's all good though.

also hit on a 5 team parlay - $5 bet to win $50.  UNC +7, USF +10, butler ML, Utah ML, and kansas -5.5

only loss of the day was texas tech.  and had they won, i would have hit a 7 team parlay, winning <b>$525</b>.  So this is a big screw you to bobby knight, for his team SUCKING ASS.  oh well, i still won over $150 today.  that'll pay my parking tickets from villanova and then some!



the other great thing about today, was the belle and sebastian and new pornographers concert.  it was GOOD.  very good.  took me long enough to get to see them.  i was going to go in november 2003, when sara really wanted to see them at, i think the tower.  i was going to take her, but, instead started going out with erin again, and well, didn't go to the show with sara obviously...  and then they didn't play USA for a few years... 

anyway... we snuck our way to the front.  not realy 'snuck' but, nobody was along the side, so we just walked up to the front of the side, and slowly everyone moved into the middle, so, we were right up front, across the left stack.  i took notes on the setlist, and actually got a copy of the B+S setlist from a crew member afterwards when he tossed it into the crowd.  it was a great show.  B+S has like 9 people onstage at once, and they sound GREAT.  they reproduce their unique sound incredibly well.  i was surprised.  here's the whole seltist on the night.  Each band varied it up really well.  surprised at the amount of mass romantic stuff from new pornographers.  
<b>
New Pornographers</b> (played for about 50 minutes)
Twin cinema, Use it, Laws have changed, July Jones, Bleeding heart show, stacked crooked, mass romantic, testament to youth in verse, fake headlines, just the numbers, bones of an idol, slow descent into alcoholism, From Blown Speakers, it's only divine right, Sing Me Spanish Techno, Letter From an Occupant

<b>Belle and Sebastian</b> 10:05-11:45
Expectations
Another Sunny Day
Funny little Frog
My Wandering Days are Over
Sukie in the Graveyard
Electrionic Renaissance
The Lonliness of a Middle Distance Runner
To be myself completely
Slow Grafitti
The Blues are Still Blue
She's Losing it (not on original setlist)

meat and potatoes and a century of fakers were both on the setlist was well, but not played.  very little from 'sinister' or 'waitress', which are my two favorite CDs.  but, it was a great show regardless - definitely, DEFINITELY worth the slightly inflated price i paid for the tickets...  

half tempted to want to go see 'em in DC tomorrow, but, well, sold out, and expensive, and 4 hours away.  but, they were that good.

now, sunday-wednesday - i'm doing nothing, but sleeping, playing videogames, reading, watching movies, and hanging out with sara.  if you are home and want to do something, lemme know.  thursday through saturday i'll be in new york city for the big east tournament, so, i won't be around.  

anyway, bedtime now."

"event","i have a ream of paper here on my computer.  500 sheets.  white paper.  you know, the kind you print stuff on.  and on the package, it says ""RESEALABLE PACK"" - as if that's a reason to buy this paper, because it's a resealable pack.  Why do i need a resealable pack of paper?  seriously.  is it going to get stale?  Do people keep the paper outside, where it could get rained on, and sealing it prevents this?  i don't get it.

but i bought it, so, their advertising must be working somehow.  

or it was the cheapest sears had when i was there.  



anyway... this week is fun.  paper due today.  midterm tomorrow in russian history (1780ish-1881 is the test material).  just finished writing up 10 pages of terms and definitions.  then thursday is a russian religion test.  shouldn't be terrible.  and really, it's not THAT much work.  just a busy few days.  then it's spring break!

friday i'm doing nothing special.  Saturday sara and i are going to see belle and sebastian and the new pornographers, which i am uber excited about.  sunday-wed i'm not doing anything special that i know of.  Then thursday - saturday is the big east tournament in NYC!  Should be a good time, mike and i are going used record shopping, and we'll probably mess with the georgetown kids, because their team sucks.  either that, or we'll all gang up on the providence kids or something.  we're staying in the crap-hole that is the hotel pennsylvania.  but hey, it's free, who am i to complain?

DMB should be releasing their tourdates soon.  It was around this time last year that they were announced.  definitely cutting back this year.  I dont 'think i've listened to DMB, except for a song here or there, since late september, oh, and i ewnt to 2 shows in december.  The shows just don't thrill me as much as they used to.  still, i want to go, and hang out with everyone i know, and enjoy the shows, because i enjoy every show when i'm there, i just don't have a need to see them 16 times again this year.  i'm going to try to cut to 7 shows this summer.  Philly, obviously.  then i'm being convinced by jeff and jay and chris to go to a show a bit.. .further away.  still haven't ran that idea by my mom.  but, there is extremely cheap airfare for it, and... well, i'm leaning towards wanting to.  and then i'd also maybe do pittsburgh, maybe saratoga, maybe new york, maybe hershey and/or scranton and/or columbia MD, but not all.  

saw STARS thursday night.  They were exceptionally good.  Saw them at ""starlight ballroom"" in philly - formerly club polaris.  this small club/dancehall/roller-rink in north philly.  (just south of spring garden, so, not THAT north philly).  we got there early, so had prime pick of where we saw the show from.  me, lisa and two of her friends claimed a booth to the side of the stage.  got to sit up on the countertop of the booth the whole show - great view.  i took a lot of good pictures - also got a copy of the setlist.  They mix it up VERY well.  maybe 15 songs played, 7 or so from set yourself on fire, 4 from heart, 3 from nightsongs, or something like that.  it was a really good show.  and cheap too - $14.25.  The saturday prior, bryan and i saw Umphrey's Mcgee at the Starland ballroom (yes, starlight, and starland) - in sayreville new jersey.  Jersey is a dirty state, but the show was great.  Umphreys is coming back may 5th to philly - electric factory, on a friday before finals, so, i'll go to that show, then study saturdya and sunday and stay in then.  

well, i think it's time for bed.  midterm tomorrow.  yay.

but seriously, resealable paper!?"

"event","whoo!  so i randomly stumbled upon the fact that the band <b>Stars</b> was playing in philly in late February.  They are quite possibly my favorite indie bands.  Possibly my favorite.  They opened for death cab for cutie on their most recent tour, and their newest CD ""set yourself on fire"" was my #3 CD of 2004.  So, obviously, I bought tickets.  They're playing at this small night club right by the electric factory.  tickets were only $12 a peice.  i bought 2, but have no idea who is going with me.  It's a thursday night, feb 23rd.  Sara?  Lisa?  Rachel?  I'm sure someone will go, or mike from band i could probably coerce into going...  Tickets are cheap, so if anyone reading this wants to go, lemme know, and i'll pick up extra tickets if need be.  

I'm excited, that's for sure.

I'm also tired, very tired.  STupid interferon, really just exhausts me.  I'm starting to get slightly behind in my work, but, hopefully i can catch up, i don't have much work the rest of the week, so, i should be able to.  i'm not THAT behind, just close to it.

i think that's all i feel like saying for now."

"event","i don't update this thing enough... like, twice in the past 2 months probably.  not like my life really has anything that exciting going on.

i woke up this morning with nearly a 102 fever.  damn interferon medicine.  that's what i get for skipping it monday.  hit me extra hard today... still feel kinda sick, but, sleep will take care of that.  i'm not asleep, because i placed a tiny bet on this basketball game, and want to watch the rest of the game to see if i win.  only a $10 bet.  dallas/seattle over 208 points.  looking like it's gonna be close.  

school started last week.  for the first time since april, i'm back going to classes and all.  it's good and bad.  it's good to get into a routine, rather than being in bed until 3 everyday practically...  and i enjoy my classes, but, lots of work, and less free time.  i miss watching crappy TV and playing videogames all day...  my classes aren't bad.  cultural anthropology, a terribly boring topic, but my teacher isn't bad, she keeps the class moving, and makes it not terrible.  and it's my only 50 minute class, which is good that it's a shorter one.  also taking imperial russian history, which is by far my favorite class.  a ton of reading, and a ton of note-taking, but it's a great topic.  also US history from 1865 on, which is alright... we're still in reconstruction era, which sucks, so, the class will get better.  and finally, religion in russia, which, again, not the greatest topic, but a great teacher, so, the class is made much better.

i'm also in the villanova band again, which is fun.  et to go to all the home basketball games.  may get to go to the big east tournament in march, and may get to go to a round or two of the NCAA championships... 

ugh, these teams are not shooting well this quarter, that's not making my wallet happy.

marissa and i are going to see a movie about transsexuals tomorrow...  ""transamerica"" it's called, i think.  should be an interesting movie.  last week we saw brokeback mountain.  i think there's something marissa isn't telling me about herself...  lisa is maybe getting us free tickets to see it too, which is great, lisa is my best friend.

me and sara are going to see belle and sebastian and the new pornogrophers in march.  i'm excited for that.  muchly.  tickets sold out in a week, i went to buy them the day they sold out, and was denied.  had to get the tickets off ebay for more than twice face value, but, whatever, still cheaper than a DMB ticket, and it's going to be a great show.  

dammit, ray allan just had a completely open 3, and missed.  he should have made that.

ok, enough ranting.  maybe i'll update again in the near future.

but probably not"

then i gave myself an interferon shot.  and i can feel that sickness coming on strong.  but it's seperate.  i can feel each sickness seperate from each other.  but overall, i feel like i've been hit by a truck.  when i wake up tomorrow, i should be fine.

"event","so... some stuff...

i'm on my 'low dose' of interferon treatment.  it's 3 times a week, 10 million units a day, through a self injection.  this is as opposed to 5x a week, 20-35 MIU a day.  so, much reduced dosage.  but, it's more of a wildcard each time i do it.  i'm always dead tired the next day.  i've taken 4+ hour naps 2 of the 4 times i've shot up with it.  i'm also cranky and miserable the next day.  now, i don't know if it's necessarily the interferon, or the fact that i've worked every morning after i've taken it.  probably a mix of both.  but, we'll see... it's only been a week and a half.

oh, i'm also losing my hair.  not LOSING my hair, but when i take a shower, there's a lot of hair that i find on my body and towel afterwards, and when i comb my hair in the morning, i can see to my scalp eaiser than i ever could, and i normally have thick hair.  but, it's nothing terrible.

work is work.  rob, jess and i are inches away from revolt.  today we went in at 7 (well, tammy showed up at 8) to do moves and all... and i swear, i thought rob was ready to flip.  it's getting kinda dire.  i'm thinking about looking elsewhere.  i want to talk to the people at the apple store, see what they offer, see if i think i'd be happier there.  still, i haven't made any decisions as to what exactly i'm doing, i just want to look into my options.

speaking of which...

i think i'm gonna take the rest of this semester off from school.  i've been to 2 classes this semester, missed 2/3 movies, 1/2 papers, and 1/2 tests.  i just feel that if i went in, took the midterm, having just read the material, all at once, not having it lectured or talked about...  i tried to catch up this past week, but, it just didn't happen.  whenever i try to start reading and focusing, my head starts to hurt.  it happened a lot when i was on the medicine before.  and i'm not gonna use the interferon stuff as a crutch, and blame it, i know that i could have it read, and focused more, and watched less TV.  but, it just didn't happen.  

i'm also trying to figure out what the hell i want to do after college.  my plan has been (at least most recently, for the past few months) is to teach history.  i just don't know if i'm cut out for that.  i don't see myself teaching.  it'd be fun i think, and the benefits are great, but, i just don't see me being cut out for it.  i chose history as a major because it's the one class i've taken that i enjoy.  

i have a few ideas in my head, nothing i'm set on going through with yet.  but, i dunno, i might make some big changes, completely change my path... maybe.  but, it may require more schooling than i'd want.  i dunno.  i'll look into it.



yesterday there were 2 of the greatest college football games of the season on TV.  PSU vs UM and USC vs ND.  PSU lost, which i'm bittersweet about.  i always was a penn state fan, but god, no offense to you guys, but you're more obnoxious than philly sports fans.  so, i kinda chuckled that they lost.  notre dame i really wanted to win, and they lost at the very end too.  

i lost my first 2 bets of the day today.  NYG -3.5 and over 47.5 parlay.  that was $15 down for $45 return.  and my other was a 5 team parlay, cincinnati -3, atlanta -6, atlanta/NO under 43.5, KC -6 and indy/STl under 51.  i won two of those, lost two.  so, nothing there.  that was $5 down to win like, $140 or something.  i always do one of those bets, when it hits, i'll be golden.

i figured, for hte hell of it, to put some money on tonights game too.  $20 down for seattle -9.5 and over 45.  i'd only win like $25, but, it'd make back themoney i lost earlier today, and it's looking good.  28-3 right now, i just need 14 more points and another quarter or two.

that's about it...  for now.

oh, i bought this today!!

Trey - November 15th - Tower Theater.  Phil Lesh - November 21st - Sovereign Center in Reading

Both shows are about $40.  Tower theater is significantly closer, but reading is only 45 minutes away, and a real simple drive.  
I really like trey's new CD, but i saw pretty much all these songs at the show in philly.  but, he puts on a real fun show.  
Phil, he's old, and won't be touring forever.  He's got some shows in february in philly, guaranteed, but, who knows if i'l be able to make it, and i definitely want to see him before he stops touring.  trey will tour forever, but, i LOVE the tower theater, and would love to see another show there.

I'd love to go to both, obviously, but i have a show on nov 12th, then these two, then a bunch of DMB ones in december, and the costs are starting to add up.  speaking of costs... i need to start working again.  i think i'm gonna do two days next week.  then 3 5 hour shifts a week for a while, and eventually just 3 shifts, any length a week, but, try to limit myself at 3 shifts a week, even during christmas...  i just don't know how much more i can handle.

anyway, any recommendations, preferences?  who should i see?"

"event","So, i haven't updated in forever.  not seriously about what's going on.  and people keep asking, so, i guess people want to know/care.

I'm on ""adjuvant therapy"" for the cancer, meaning, it's treatment given in order to prevent it from coming back, not to get rid of it.  So, the doctors all agree that as well as they can tell, i'm free of it.  that doesnt' mean it's not there though, but, as far as they can tell from modern medicine and testing, it's not there.  

but, i'm through the first month of the interferon treatment.  the first month involved driving down to philly every morning at 9AM, sitting in a chair for 2 hours and being pumped full of fluids and medicines, sitting alongside anyhwere from 5 to 25 other cancer patients.  weird to see all the people coming through.  one girl looked like she couldn't be any older than 12 or 13.  a few other people my age, the one hipster punk looking kid...  most people weren't there every day, but, i recognized a lot who would come once a week.  every wednesday there was this one light skinned black guy who i talked to a couple times.  but, the treatment didn't make me feel as miserable as i was told it would.  first couple days i got really sick, fever of 103.  the rest of the time, i don't think my fever went much over 100.  it still completely drained me.  i would come home, and just crash on the couch 4 days out of 5, and sleep for a couple hours and never really fully feel rested.  also very sore in my joints.  and very weak.  walking a short distance would completely wind me.  

i'm still feeling all of these things, having not taken any interferon in 5 days now, but, to a lesser degree.  today i started feeling sick, i don't know why.  it's not a cold or anything, cause i logically can't get colds.  but, just a bad headache, and body aches overall.  i just couldn't sit up and read (was working for class), and i fell asleep on the floor for an hourish instead.  but, overall, it's not too bad, i still seem to need to take a daily nap, and still get tired easily, but i can make it up a flight of stairs and not need to catch my breath afterwards now, which is good.  saturday my mom and i went out to take the dogs for a walk through the park at roberts, and i walked quite a distance.  was tired, but nothing i couldnt' fight through.

basically, with the treatment now... i need to start the low dose portion.  so, for the net 48 weeks (11 months) i inject myself 3 times a week, with 10 million units of this interferon.  (i was on 35 for 2 weeks, 30 for 1 week and 20 for one week before).  i'll give 'em to myself before bed, so i'll sleep through the worst of hte side effects.  mostly, for the next year, i'm gonna be tired, and sore, and not fully energized really.  but, it comes and goes.  i can still do pretty much anything i did before.  even when i was going through the worst of the high dose stuff, i still went out with sara weekend nights and such.  

i have a lot of concerts coming up!  <img src=""http://www.ufck.org/forums/images/smilies/bananasmile.gif""/><img src=""http://www.ufck.org/forums/images/smilies/bananasmile.gif""/> <img src=""http://www.ufck.org/forums/images/smilies/woohoo.gif""/><img src=""http://www.ufck.org/forums/images/smilies/bananasmile.gif""/><img src=""http://www.ufck.org/forums/images/smilies/bananasmile.gif""/>

oh, go buy the new ryan adams CD - jacksonville city nights.  it's amazing.

and watch arrested development, mondays at 8.  best TV show ever.

speaking of ryan adams... listen to how depressing this song is... this guy is such a good songwriter, but, so depressing sometimes

Laura lays on the foot of the bed
mimics a noose with the telephone cord
doctors on the phone and she hangs up and says
""i aint never gonna see the winter again""
and i don't know how but she smiles
september.  september.



the next verse is him visiting her grave... 

'hard way to fall' is also immensely depressing..."

"event","so... i got my laptop back from bestbuy today!  w00t!  gave it in a week or two ago, so they could fix a slew of problems.  they fixed my screen, so far no troubles.  and also gave me a new hard drive.  lost all the info on the old one, but, nothing too important as far as i remember.  so... i'm glad to have it back.  it's running pretty well right now.  a lot faster, and cooler.  apparently they replaced a couple fans too.  also runs quieter...  same laptop though.  

in more serious news... i'm starting chemotherapy august 29th.  Talked to my (new) dr about it on the 15th of july.  She said that at my age, it's definitely worth it.  I'd reduce the chances of it coming back from 35-45% to 28-38%.  So, definitely some benefit there, not huge, but, she said at my age it is, and since i'm younger, i can probably fight it off better.  basically, it entails for the entire month of september, me going down to philly 5 times a week to get injections.  sometime in the next couple weeks i'm getting surgery to install a plug into my neck which'll connect to a vien.  so for those 5 times a week, i can just get the injection into the plug/IV thing.  then after that, I have to inject myself at home 3 times a week.  The first month i'm basically going to feel like i have the flu x10 nonstop.  my hair may thin a bit, but will not fall out.  so, the enire month of sept, i'm not working.  and probably wont' be going to school.  i may take the entire semester off.  I may only take 2 or 3 classes... who knows.  i need to inject myself for 11 months, until next august.  yes, that's depressing.  and for those 11 months, i'll still feel sick.  some people feel terrible, some can function pretty well.  i'm really not sure how i'll feel.  kinda worried.  i want to see dmb in december, i want to see them summer 2006 even! but, i'll still be on the chemo.  so... i hope it isn't too terrible, and i can live with it.  and i hope i can at least take a full courseload of classes in the spring of 2006... marissa and i can both make up classes together!  heh.

speaking of marissa, i hung out with her and her friends last week.  it was... interesting.  we made peanut butter and jelly milkshakes, went swimming in the algae filled pool, dressed up in her grandmothers clothes (i have some interesting pictures... heh), played foosball, and then just sat around for a while.  peopel came and went from her house, throughout the night... kelly and derek were there, nicole and lindsay (her cousin and her friend), brett, and mike... i think that's it.  it was fun.  i need to take sara and mark over there swimming sometime soon... 

things with sara are going well.  she's working 80 jobs or so.  she watched a dog for a week, which was fun.  the dog was really cool.  he liked me even though he bit me a lot.  next weekend sara and i are going up to new york to see DMB at randalls island.  we're staying with jim at xander's house up in northern new jersey.  i'm excited for that.  

i think that's it...  i have more to say, but don't feel like saying it.  heh.

i went bowling tonight.  3rd frame.  i threw out my back, horribly.  it hurt.  very very very bad.  my back and entire left leg.  very very badly.  came home and took 2 vicodin, it makes my stomach feel sick, very very sick... ugh.  

bowling was fun until i threw my back out.  was bowling a 48 on my first 3 frames.  at that pace i woulda hit 160!  damn.  so, somehow i was able to successfully drive home.  in a  lot of pain.  came home, laid down for a while, took some vicodin and drove to marks before it kicked in.  we hung out there for a bit, then went over to go see batman begins with kirsten.  (along with me, mark and sara, obviously)  so, mark drove to the movies, and we saw batman begins.

amazingly good movie.  amazingly so.  started off somewhat slow, i wanted to see batman dammit!  but when it got there, it was good.  definitely recommend seeing it.  i took my vicodin 5 hours ago.  ugh, i need to stop feeling sick, now.  my stomach just... not feel good.  glad i had sara around though afterwards.  i take her forgranted more often than i should.  it's a fault of mine, i admit it.  i take way too many things forgranted... and i need to change it.  i definitely realized tonight though about sara.  so... maybe it'll start something.  

tomorrow marissa and i go see DMB in scranton!  i'm excited.  as far as my back is ok, it'll be great.  

i had 5 dreams last night that i all remember.
1 - i was going somewhere in my car, as i drove away, the echo in the driveway had it's lights on, so i went to go turn them off.  as i walked back, my car had driven itsetlf up the street and caught on fire.  the fire then spread to the houses nearby, i go to call 911, but i don't remember how, and when i do, i do it very slowly.
2 - i went to zach pickens' house for his birthday party type thing.  i go up to his room, and see the door to his room is just in the wall, with no floor in front of it.  so, i have to walk around the house to get in through the side.  i hang out in his room with him, conor (i think) and some other people.  we were watching the phillies, and hanging out, and his room was huge, had lots of stuff in it...
3 - sara and i weren't 'dating' per-se.  instead, we had some understood agreement - we would end up together, and be married and all that, but at the time, we weren't dating.  i was dating marissa, for a long time we were dating, but weren't serious.  i had a change of heart and wanted to be with sara, as i knew we were 'meant to be', and i remember saying to her ""look, once we get together, we can never break up, so, are you sure you want to do this now?""  it was weird
the last two dreams are kinda together, htey both involve me flipping out
4 - i was on the patio with my family, and after a real cranky day, someone did or said something to bother me, so i just start screaming at them all, and slam the door.  
5 - was at work.  old sam goody.  tammy was the 'head boss' and marianne was like, assistant head boss, each with their own offices overlooking the store.  i took some huge widescreen tv from the backroom, and i forget what i was going to do with it... but i got in trouble, then went to talk to marianne, and she's like ""why do you not care anymore?  why are you doing all this?"" and i just started screaming about all this stuff... it was weird.  

but... yeah.  those were my dreams.  my vicodin is starting to wear off, feeling less sick...  

anyway, go see batman begins - the movie rocks.

oh, sean, i haven't seen you online lately, but you IMed me - no, sara wouldn't go if we went to a phillies game, unless i really coerced her, which, i could do, but won't.  and friday i'm busy - have to work.  saturday DMB, and sunday, well, i might work... but, unless they're cheap seats, i just can't afford it right now.  sorry."

met a bunch of people from the boards.  jay, jason, teefs, phan, phans friend rachel, xander (who i know already), eric, bob (he's so fricken cool), tim... um... there might have been more.  oh, CRUMBO!  how i can i forget crumbo!  also met tim, matt and melissa, friend's of rachels, who wasn't there, but her friends bought a ticket from yee, and they were really cool.  ended up running into them on the train ride home, so i followed them and sat with them for the ride back.

we were standing in front of the soundbaord.  near the back, but, figured anywhere in the place was fine.  the band was ON.  the new songs sounded tight and polished, and a ton of old songs - 41, two step, jimi thing, warehouse, one swee world...  great setlist.  great mix of old and new.  steady as we go is beuatiful, die trying has a great jam, louisiana bayou still needs work, but is good, dreamgirl sounds like it could turn out alright.  hunger for the great light sounds amazingly polished, but the little breakdown/funk jam part in the middle needs to be extneded.  they didn't do too much with it.  but it was cool.

mmm...

new york city is a fun place too.  2nd time there in 2 weeks.  mext time i go i'm tempted to see what it's like to drive into the city... can't be THAT terrible...doesn't look it.  drove up 95/njtpk to new brunswick this time.  it's about an hour train ride and an hour 15 minute drive or so... not bad.  

well, i have a final at 10:45 tomorrow.  that i'm nowhere near prepared for.  i kinda missed 1/4 or so of the classes because of stupid cancer, so, i don't know how in the hell i'm going to write 3 essays...  blech.  whatever.  i may end up with a very poor grade in that class.  still have a paper to finish too.

bah to school.  it can always make a good mood go bad"

"event","oh, i forgot to talk about the hole in the back of my head!

i had minor surgery thursday, where they cut open the back of my head to take out some skin, and stitch it back together.  it's really cool!

i'll post a picture later."

"event","so, here's an update...  first, two matters of importance

<b>first of all</b>, tomorrow, is sunday.  i want to see this band - stars at the TLA.  does anyone like them?  tickets are only $13.  i might end up going by myself... or not at all.  but, would anyone want to go?

<b>secondly</b> comcast people in the area, are you still having problems with your connection?  I sure am.  basically, it's dropping packets of data, and causing AIM/aol to sign off every 5-10 minutes, then reconnect.  it's a huge pain.  anyone still having problems?  i guess i'll have to give them a call on monday.  blech.

possibly the coolest thing of the past two weeks, surprisingly isn't our jammys trip, which i'll get to later, but my next trip to NYC.  next monday, may 9th, i'm going to roseland ballroom to see DMB at their album release party for stand up!  tickets to this were impossible to get.  it's the first time DMB's playing at a venue this small since 1995.  TEN YEARS.  i'm gonna be one of the firsts to hear their new songs.  i'm quite excited.  yes... i paid a bit more than face for the tickets, but, you only live once.  and in my case, hell, i have cancer, might as well do what i want to do, and say screw money for now.  

onto my cancer...

lessee... i saw the super-cancer-doctor last friday.  i probably told most of you this individually, but if not... basically, he said that there are two things we need to do.  get rid of whatever cancer may be left in me, and make it not come back.  in my case, there is a 35-45% chance of it coming back sometime later in life.  First of all, though, they want to be 100% sure there is none left, as each time they operated, they found a little bit.  so, next friday, the 13th ironically, i'm going in for another surgery.  this time at jefferson hospital, and i'll have to be there overnight at least 1 night, maybe 2.  come visit me!  just go to the hospital and ask for my room i guess.  friday or saturday.  anyway.  they're going to reopen me up, and dig around and find every last lymph node in there, and take them out.  a lot more intensive it seems like, as they're going to be really digging around for lymph nodes.  depending on the results of my catscan, which is this wednesday, they may go in for the deep lymph nodes which involves an incision in my abdomen.  i will end up with another drain, whoo!  and also, an elastic stocking that i must wear on my leg for up to 6 months after the operation.  if i don't wear it, my leg will swell.  it's going to be a pain in the ass and a half, but, whatever.  

surgery is 13th... ryan adams show is 20th.  guess i'm not seeing that one.  star wars premiere is the 19th, i see no reason why i can't still make that.  bryan and mark, when you get the chance, $10 for your tickets.  sara, just let me know when you know if you can go for sure.

well, anyway... the second thing the dr said we need to do is make sure the cancer doesn't come back.  there are 3 options.
1) close observations - involves a catscan/chest x-ray and blood test every 3 months for 2 years, then every 4 months, 6 months... and so on.  
2) chemotherapy - this option sucks.  it'll make me feel like i have the flu, nonstop, make me feel like crap, involves 5 injections a week for a month, then 3 a week for the rest of the year... oh, and it doesn't stop the cancer from coming back, just delays it a year.  oh, and a few of his patients have died on it from their pancreas exploding, or of endochronitis.  so, um, no.
3) vaccine - the vaccine is still experimental.  and it's offered either here in philly, in new york city, or in pothesda MD (near washington.)  if i get it in philly, there's only a 75% chance i'm getting the vaccine, and not a placebo, as it's a trial, they need a control variable.  so, that's out.  maryland may be out as i may not fit their critera of the patient they want, and new york, well, that's the most viable option it seems.  the maryland option is best though, as it's 100% free.  so you say ""that sounds pretty good, you can get this vaccine"".  well... it's only available for 40% of the tissue types.  i had a crapload of blood taken on thursday to see if my tissue type is the right kind.  literally, they took 3 LARGE vials of blood from me.  but, i'll find that out next week, if i'm even qualified for it.  then, for 6 months, every two weeks i need to go to one of these places and recieve the vaccine.  so... we'll see about that one.

that's basically it for surgery-related stuff..

last sunday night sara and i went to see ben folds.  he was great, as expected.  the opening band/musician, butch walker... yeah... didn't like him.  furthermore, i didn't like his fans.  at all.  blech.  the show was out in millersville.  sara and i drove through the ghettoy ghetto part of lancaster to get there.  kinda scary, luckilly, we went around it on the way home.  ben's set, for those interested was:
in between days, gone, always someone cooler than you, jesusland, bastard, carrying cathy, all you can eat, you to thank, trusted, landed, bitches ain't shit, zak and sara, ironman, emaline, the luckiest, army, where's summer b, rockin the suburbs, philosophy, late, rock this bitch, not the same// eddie walker, one angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces.
it was a good show.  sara and i had a good time.

tuesday night was a night of epic proportions.  bryan and i drove up to princeton, to get on a train to new york city to see the fifth annual jammy awards!  the awards show was cool, some acts were... well... less than desirable, sinead oconner being the main one.  wasn't too into yonder mountain string band either.  bluegrass just isn't my thing.  i can hardly tolerate SCI most of the time.  benevento russo duo was amazing, as were the disco biscuits.  after the jammys' ended around 12:30, we headed north about 8 blocks to bb king blues club.  an amazing venue.  umphryes came on around 130AM, and played until 5AM.  it was quite the show.  quite the show.  CUBS!!!  the setlist of that was as follows

I: jazz odyssey->in the kitchen, push the pig, resolution*, soul food*, bad is bad*, heart and soul*, believe the lie, glory->the bottom half, women wine and song->hurt bird bath->jam#->jam2$->jam3$->hurt bird bath
II: making flippy floppy->ballgame jam with nellie mckay, pay the snucka, miss tinkles overture, thin air, bright lights
E: plunger

* - with huey lewis
# - with two guys from the biscuits
$ - with the biscuits and joe russo

yeah.  the show was amazing.  look at that setlist.  i'm listening to the making flippy floppy right now (a talking heads cover). t he banshee that is nellie mckay is about to join them though...

for more info about our experience, see  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/slackjawwonder/168548.html?view=407396"" bryans entry here /a>

so, yeah, these past copule weeks have been interesting.  if you look at them from only my concerts i've been to and am planning, they've been great.  then there's cancer, and school... not so great.  4 more days of classes though!  still have 2 big papers to write, neither with due dates though.  and some finals.

i also upgraded my computer to tiger today - OSX 10.4.  it's great.  dashboard is great.  i enjoy tiger greatly.  for all you mac dorks, go buy it."

"event","i had a dream last night...

there was a concert that i was going to.  it took place in my basement.  or well, a place that looked a lot like it.  in the laundry room.  we were in the other, non laundry room part, waiting to go into the 'concert venue', and finally, we were allowed to go, so all 1700 people seeing the show ran over.  i somehow got to be in the front row, leaning right up against the washer and dryer, which the band was playing atop.  (no idea who the band was).  bryan was with me.  and earlier in the dream, jeff f. was.  so, we're front row, and i have to pee.  but if i leave for the bathroom, i leave y spot.  so, instead of leaving the room, i go behind the furnace and pee into a bottle...  and since i didn't leave the room, i didn't lose my spot.  the concert starts, and bryan and i actually leave after 2 or 3 songs, no idea why.  later, we realize that if we didn't leave so early into the show, we wouldn't have been able to make it up to NYC in time to see umphreys mcgee and the jammys...

and that's my dream.

in other news. i saw my new dr yesterday.  whoo boy, do i have some fun times coming up.  i'll make a longer post about it later, since i need to get up now and go to work.  

i also got an email last night, bryan, take note.  about the jammys.  doors at 7, show at 8.  the show is expected to last FIVE HOURS.  that's FIVE HOURS of some of the best jamband music around.  that brings us to 1AM, where we will run down the block, to like 40th street or something, and see umphreys until the sun rises. concert event of a lifetime as i told my mom yesterday.  she replied ""every concert is to you""... which i couldn't deny

ok.  work."

"event","has anyone heard of the band ""stars""?  They're from montreal, like the arcade fire and broken social scene.  kinda more mellow than either of those bands.  they're great though.  anyway, would anyone want to go see them with me?  $13 for tickets, plus charges, still less than $20, at the TLA, sunday may 1st.  I'd have to wait until at least friday to be definite about it, to make sure i'm not in surgery or recovering then.

also, sara, should i go ahead and buy tickets for ryan adams?  

i'll have another post later... about more meaningful things, like my cancer, and disdain for class, and general miserablity lately..."

"event","i feel like ranting for a while.  so that is what i'm going to do.  this week feels so incredibly long... monday i was on campus from 10AM until 4:00.  meeting with my advisor, reading for an hour and a half, class, class, class, library, meeting with my history teacher.  tuesday was my short day, two classes.  done.  then go to work.  yesterday i was here from 1130AM until about 5 becuase of a pointless ethics lecture.  took an hour and a half to say what i could sum up in about 35 seconds.  yet,this guy is a yale professor.  today, isn't terribly long... but a pain in the ass regardless.  

class at 10, had to skip physics at 11:30, because it was the only time i could schedule a writing center appt, since i was out for a week with surgery.  went to that, she gave me a lot of help on my paper, and really helped it.  so, if i was turning it in to any teacher, it'd probably get an A, except, my ethics teacher is going to look at one thing, and give it a C because i'm not going to include it.  he wants it to include different moral theories, even though none of them apply.  so... i'm cranky and annoyed about that.  that i'm actually spending a lot of time on this paper, and because i feel these theories don't apply, and don't fit, he's not going to be happy.  meh, i can still salvage a B in the class, i hope

after that appt, i was going to go to my physics lab, except it started early because class ended early.  thus, i missed my 3rd lab of the semester.  i wouldn't be surprised if my lab grade was a C.  i missed 3 of them.  2 directly because of surgeries, and a third indirectly because of it.  now i'm sitting in the computer lab, waiting for an appt with my english TA to go over my paper.  not really sure why we need to go over a paper that's been graded and done with.  i guess ideas for the next one.  i don't know.  but, for some reason, i need to do so...  blech.

i'm just annoyed.  mostly at my ethics teacher who is a peice of shit.  but... whatever.  next week i have 2 4 page history papers to write, as well as finishing up my ethics paper,a nd presentation, oh, and a physics test.  the week after i have a 6-10 page english paper to write.  and the following week, another ethics paper/final, MC test, and an english presentation.

ugh.  it needs to be over.  i've whined about this to so many people, so many differnet times.  but it just needs to be over.  it's getting there though.  just gotta take it one step at a time.  tonight i'll try to get my ethics paper close to finished... of course, that's after i work until 10 or 1030 or so.

i'm gonna go to the library, get stuff copied for my english paper i'm gonna have to do."

"event","it's 1:45 in the morning... no idea why i'm not asleep.  i really ought to be.  i'm not going to school again tomorrow.  i may go to my physics lab.  but, i'm still recovering from surgery somewhat.  still get very exhausted quickly, and sitting for a long period of time makes my leg sore as hell.  so, i'm just gonna stay at home, and i plan to get most of my ethics paper 1st draft cranked out tomorrow.  that's my plan.  

i just spent the last 10 minutes or so thinking about all these things i wanted to say in a livejournal entry.  not really a public one, but, just a lot of thoughts i have going on in my mind, why i get so worked up and upset over certain things...  but, as i tried to start to write it, it just didn't ome out. so i gave up.  maybe later.  but, for now, it just didn't do anything.  

so, if you're not following along, monday was surgery #2.  they took the cut they made in my groin to take out 1 lymph node about 3 or 4 times larger, and took out a lot of lymph nodes.  they will all be tested for cancer.  if they come out clean, i'm fine, and just need a hell of a lot of tests, often, to make sure nothing is back.  if they aren't clean... then i go see some special doctor in philly, and possibly throw my entire summer of plans down the drain.  i'm hoping it doesn't come to that.  and that even if it does come back positive, i can still find some way to go through with what i have planned already.  but, i don't expect it to come back positive.  at least i hope not...  blech.  well, in the surgery, they also left a drain in my leg.  this little rubber hting about half an inch long, they then connected that to a 3 foot tube, into this rubber ball thing. lymphatic fluid then drains down this tube into the ball, which i empty twice a day. it's a cloudy reddish pink color.  kinda... odd.  but kinda cool at the same time.  friday i get that taken out.  it'll be nice to not have a rubber ball pinned inside my pantleg anymore.

school still exists.  which sucks.  finals start a month from now.  it just needs to be over now.  i figure, i just need to get through this semester.  just get through it.  get good grades in classes for my major...  sigh.  it just frustrates me.  a lot of things do...  but if i can get this ethics paper done tomorrow, then i just have 2 more papers left.  i will be so happy when this semester finally ends.  may will be a great month.  the end of school, DMB album, new star wars movie...  

meh, i guess i'm done talking now.  i'm feeling kinda... blech.  probably just from being in all the time. which, i don't intend to change tomorrow.  i'll go to school friday.  i promise.

"event","i only updated 3 times in march... i should update more.

so, here's some stuff

i still have cancer.  well, maybe.  took out my lymph node, had very very minor cancerness on it.  so, monday they're taking out... MORE LYMPH NODES!  so, whatever.  they'll take them out, and then, be done with it, with the exceptional cat and pet scan from time to time.  at least, that's what it seems like.  hopefully the lymph nodes they take out will be negative.  if they're not... then i could be in trouble.  if they are positive, i need to go see the super cancer doctor sooner, and have treatment of some sort.  meaning, it could interfere SEVERLY with my spring and summer concert plans.  

but, the good news, is that most likely my nodes wil be all good.  and since the surgery is so soon... The chances of going to NYC for the jammys and for umphreys skyrocket to 100%!!!  speaking of which, bryan and i are going to see umphreys mcgee in new york city.  april 26th adn 27th.  first the jammys award show on the 26th, then at 1AM on the 27th, umphreys mcgee down the street at BBking blues club/grill/bar/place.  ben folds is 2 days prior to that, and then may 10th is the DMB album, may 19th is star wars episode 3's release, and june 4th, the start of my DMB tour for the summer... mmm, yeah.

tonight, sara came over and we went to go see Sin City.  It was amazingly amazing and cool.  i really liked it.  she did too, as far as i could tell.  it was really well done, really well directed.  and sara got to see her hero, half of the gilmore girls.  heh.  but the movie was incredibly cool, go see it if you get the chance.  while there, i ran into mike, our favorite sam goody customer.  he always buys lots of stuff from marianne and i.  he was there to see the movie, and directly across from him was pete!  (FYE pete).  so, i talked to them for a while before the show.  pete asked when i was working next, i said ""not next week, i have surgery"" he goes ""what, is it cancer?"" at the same time as i say ""yeah, it's skin cancer"".  he was quite embarassed and upset.  i really didn't care, at all.  but, seemed like he felt bad.  oh well.  the movie was cool.  that's all i'm trying to get to.  after the movie i took sara home and all.  

school is... well it's down to the last month.  but it's going to be absolute hell.  7 pages of papers in history, 7-10 for ethics, and i believe another 7-10 for english.  finals in history, english, ethics, and phsyics.  another physics test other than that.  a group presentation for english, as well as ethics, and for ethics, my partner has mono.  stupid marissa.  

sigh... all that in the next month.  but then... 3 months+ off.  god, i can't wait.  this semester needs to end.  i need to register for classes for next semester, and meet with my advisor first.  and call to make a writing center appointment.  and i have no motivation or desire to do any of this work.  none at all.  i'd like to say it's because i'm focusing on getting better, and over all this medical stuff... but, really... i'm just sick of these classes.  ethics and somewhat english are the only ones i really can't stand.  ethics really.  take out ethics, and i'm fine.  

oh well.  in better news, arrested development was on TV tonight.  so tivo got it for me, so i'm watching it now.  this show is so amazingly funny.

well, i think that's it.  bedtime."

this summer... well... this summer i'm seeing a lot of shows.  and spending a lot of money.  meh, i'll get to this stuff, later, for now, lets talk about the shows.  <br><br>
<lj-cut text=""the shows i'm seeing"">
june 4th and 5th - burgettstown PA - this is out by pittsburgh.  not 100% sure on this show, but, it's the 3rd and 4th show of the tour, meaning tons of new material.  jim and his sister are going out there, so i have a ride there, and if 4 of us go, that means a hotel room split 4 ways.  not too bad.  anyone wanna join me?  

june 22 - MONTAGE MOUNTAIN - scranton PA - this one is the surprise of the tour.  I dont' think DMBs ever played there.  it's a small little place, kinda like merriweather.  i'm excited for it.  about the same distance away as hershey, only up north instead.  

june 25 - hershey - annual trip to hershey.  not the best venue, or parking lot.  or sound.  but hey, it's hershey.  just gotta be done.

july 1st and 2nd - SPAC - courtney and i are probably going up.  still need to check on some things, but, we're probably going.  she can probably get us free tickets too.  so that's nice.

july 5th and 6th - camden.  

and finally...

august 19, 20, and 21 at THE GORGE AMPITHEATER.  

there are also a pair of NYC shows july 30 and 31 that jeff and xander are trying to convince me to go to, but i just can't do it... too many already.

now... i need to see who's going to what shows and all. and i need my WH acct to come through for me... badly.  i'm requesting a lot of shows.  and hope to get tickets to them...  so much luck involved.  can't say i like that. 


it's really making me kinda anxious.  in a bad way.  i know i'm spending a lot of money.  and i know it makes some people unhappy, my mom and girlfriend namely, for obvious reasons... but, i have a handle on it.  yeah, it's expensive.  but, it's just that that's the way things are falling this year.  i feel bad being away on my birthday, i'd like to be with sara and my family and all... but, i did promise courtney i'd go to saratoga with her.  that's one of the things i need to figure out.  

and as far as paying for all this goes.  i have a good deal saved up, and can easily pay for all, easily.  but i figure... i'll do this.  i'll put half of each paycheck away towards the tour to pay it off.  that'll be paid off before the shows even start.  then from that point on, i'll put half my paycheck away to save, and not touch, and use the rest for whatever.  when i decided a while ago to start actually saving money, i never had a plan.  and while i did save a lot more of my money than i had in the past, i still spent a lot of it too. so.  i want to actually save a good amount.  but... yeah, that's my plan.  

if all this goes according to plan, the shows could be great... just getting a lot of negativity about it from people... which is expected and deserved, just makes me kinda nervous.

still excited though"

Goodbye, Y100; hello, The Beat

By Michael Klein

INQUIRER STAFF WRITER




Signs are pointing to the imminent death of radio station Y100 after nearly 12 years.


The modern-rock station, WPLY-FM (100.3), stopped using live disc jockeys at noon today when midday host Bret Hamilton signed off. Y100's Web site, www.y100.com, was changed to read ""under construction.""


Sister station WPHI-FM (The Beat) will move from 103.9 to use the stronger signal of 100.3, according to station insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity. The changeover is scheduled for midnight.


The 103.9 spot eventually will become a black-gospel station, the insiders said. A loop tape will be broadcast on 103.9 to steer listeners west on their dial, to 100.3.


Indications of the change began on the Preston & Steve morning show. Preston Elliot and Steve Morrison, who are bound for WMMR-FM (93.3) in the summer, were to air their Y100 finale tomorrow.


But before their 10 a.m. signoff, the show turned into a sort of wake. The station's program director, Jim McGuinn, mused on the air about his own future.


Y100 executives would not return messages.


Meanwhile, a Web site, www.y100rocks.com, has been set up. It contains an online radio station with a Y100-style playlist as well as an online petition to save Y100. The site's source was unclear."

"event","snow!!!  wheeee!!

as i walked out of my music class today, i saw that it was snowing!  didn't even realize it was supposed to snow today.  met with marissa for our ethics class... afterwards there was a good inch or two on the ground.  so, i threw some at her, and vice versa, and back and forth.  i almost threw her to the ground, but decided that would be mean, so, i held off.  then i went to my history class.  it wasn't too bad, a lot of reading, and a lot of writing, but, i think it won't be terrible.  before leaving, i called marianne at work, since i thought she called me, talked to her for a while about stuff, and went to kennedy to buy my books.

$350 later i bundled myself up in my jacket, headphones, scarf (well, sara's scarf), hood and gloves... and walked to the parking lot.  tons of snow on my car, cleared it off, and made my way home succesfully in the snow.

now i'm on my way to work.  my bet is... 18-23 transactions between 5 and close tonight.  we'll see.  might not even hit that.  laura said that her store has had FIVE transactions so far tonight.  so maybe it'll be even deader than that.  it'd be nice.  lots of pulldown and an early close.

well, i'm off."

"event","meh, might as well update.  i had more to write about this morning... so, i don't know if i'll remember it all.

so far this week has been slow, but enjoyable.  worked 10-5 on sunday, longest shift this week, but it wasn't bad.  except for dealing with konz... he can be a pain.  a lot.  monday and tuesday i had off, so i watched TV and DVDs.  i discovered the second best television show ever on sunday, with 24.  it's so good.  so incredibly fricken good.  like, melt your face good.  i say second best, because nothing tops arrested development.  i watched anchorman on monday, it was 'eh'.  nothing special, had some funny scenes, but it wasn't great.  today i saw farenheit 9/11.  it was good.  obviously, it's biased, strongly, but, there are some things that you can't ignore.  like bush's ties to the bin-laden family and the saudi government.  of course, the bin laden family is far removed from osama bin laden, but still, it is his family, i'm sure he's getting money from them somehow, meaning we're funding him.  i especially liked the scene of the marine/army recruiters, just because those guys are dicks, and a pain to deal with.  ""yeah, well, lemme get some info, just so i know that i talked to you and to make sure to take you off the list"" ""yeah, ok, my name is... address..."" .... ""well, there's one to add to our list!""

i still have harold and kumar to watch.  should be funny, but dumb.  which works for me.  then i forget what's coming to me from netflix... modern times maybe, an old charlie chaplin movie...  and trainspotting sometime soon.  

today was the macworld expo.  talked a lot about the new OS, tiger, which will be sweet, as well as iWork - their version of MS office, dashboard - a konfabulator like device, and some other cool stuff.  but the two big things were these...

<img src=""http://images.appleinsider.com/images/mini.jpg""/>
THAT is the ENTIRE computer.  half the height of an ipod mini.  

and this...
<img src=""http://images.apple.com/home/2005/images/shuffleheroc20050111.jpg""/>
the ipod shuffle.  it's a flash based ipod, either 512 MB or 1GB, for $99 or $149.  and it will randomly pick songs from your itunes playlist to load onto it (or you can choose ones to put on).  

the computer shown is amazing.  it's a very powerful computer for it's size and price, just $500. 

i got a new cell phone the other day.  upgraded our plan to a family plan so that my sister could be on the plan as well, and i figured i'd upgrade my phone.  it's the motorola V551.  really like it, text messaging isn't as easy, which kinda bothers me.  but, oh well.  it's a nice phone.

i have an arcade fire concert coming up on jan 31st, i can't wait for that.  and possibly ben folds on the 28th, but that's looking doubtful that sara can go to it...  and my mom wouldn't exactly want me going i'm sure, but, i want to."

"event","Tomorrow I move into a new flat, an event that would be happy one if I hadn't realised that my mother had been using the toilet and then handling all my things without washing her hands.  I'm willing to admit that cultural norms do vary quite widely, but I'm not sure there's an excuse for a 52 year-old woman living in Manchester who can afford to drink a bottle of white wine every evening.

Had a silly argument with my partner today, about what should and does count as 'transgender'.  I'm afraid that I got a bit elitist and rather alienated hir.  I think it's very hard for some of us trans women who've lost a lot during transition to feel that CDs and various other gender-benders have a claim to the label transgender.  They obviously do.  It's just hard not to have a bad gut reaction.

Everything's packed, so I'm stuck here twiddling my thumbs.  Going through my things, there were a lot of reminders left over here and there of my first relationship.  I think I have learned some lessons, looking back.  Or maybe I'm just a little more tired of life and less inclined to argue?  A bit of both?

Looked in the mirror and didn't recognise myself.  I've had some kind of flu-ey thing for a few days and haven't been looking after myself.  It's amazing how quickly eyebrows can turn into a forehead-beard when you're sleeping all day.

Soooooooooooooooooo.  Anything interesting?  Not really, although the light-headedness is a lot like the morphine drip when I was in Thailand, although of course I ache all over.  It's not entirely unpleasant, though, as it's the first reminder for quite a while that my whole body is alive, and not just the parts that I encounter on a daily basis."

"event","Back home after a week or so with Jude, meeting the family and getting kissed by the dogs (well, one dog - Bob the boxer).  Got drawn into a conversation on the metro about whether I was female or not, and then ended up talking about music with an amazingly trashed guy.

Bit shaken by the number of deaths from the recent earthquake.  I've got a soft spot for Thailand having visited there for a month.  Fortunately, all my friends there live around the corner of the coast and weren't affected directly by the 'quake or tsunami.  

Life with my partner Jude continues to be great, although the more I feel for hir the more I worry about losing hir.  Everything's definitely going faster than a 'normal' relationship, but I don't see how we could change this without losing out in the long-run.  I guess I'm just scared of getting something wrong.  Hopefully, I've learned enough from my previous LTR that I won't make the same mistakes this time.

I managed to get a job doing copywriting for the web.  SEO stuff.  Hopefully, I'll get enough contract work to keep myself afloat or to healthily supplement a 'real' job.  Decided to indulge in more selfish surgery, so it's either that or escort work.  Or not.

Goodnight, folks."

"event","I'm Amy, the Ugly Lesbian of the title.&nbsp; Actually, I'm probably
not as grotesque as I think I am, as I've been getting the odd
compliment and have also fallen in mutual love with my boifriend
recently. <br>
<br>
Lately I have: missed seeing Kasabian, purchased a Fukuoku 9000 at a
great shop in Manchester (I'll give the name of it when I can
remember), got a job as a copywriter (SEO) and seen The Incredibles.<br>
<br>
I'm a post-op transsexual and queer, which I guess gives me a little
sad, lonely, underground status of some kind or another.&nbsp; I get
enough fourteen year old boys hitting on me, anyway, whatever that
proves.&nbsp; I spend a lot of my time listening to Stumbleine and
eating houmous.<br>
<br>
I'll write again soon, possibly when I'm feeling less depressed.&nbsp; Venlafaxine sucks.<br>
<br>
Take care.<br>"

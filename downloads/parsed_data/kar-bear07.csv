On the up side I'm listening to Akon :) I can't wait till this weekend! It is going to be so fucking sweet. No parents from wednesday to sunday is going to fucking rule. All me and cam are going to do is drink and smoke, it's gonna be great. I have to cancel the gigantic party I was going to have though. I can deal with that though I'll just have to drink with a few friends... unless people show up anyway. Oh well I don't feel like typing anymore so yeah whatever.

"event","I really hate it when people complain about the minor things in their lives. It's like so what if your car broke down or people bugged you... who cares. At least your all free and living life instead of being locked up for some petty reason. None of you had to put your life on hold because some crazy bitch got pissed at you. Stop bitching about your little bullshit and grow the fuck up. Maybe you should all just live a day in someone else's shoes. I'm not saying like any friend of yours either that has the same ""problems"" as you I'm talking about real problems. Problems like your dad drinks too much and mentally abuses you or you have to get a job because your family cant pay for food or your in jail because of something retarded. I want you all to stop complaining and appreciate the things in your life. STOP BITCHING! Some people just piss me off creating drama off of nothing... GROW UP YOU LITTLE BITCH!

I am best friends with Cameron. She gets a little crazy and even stupid sometimes ,but what can I say.... she's blond. I am in the most incredible mood right now. I would describe it as floating. I like floating it's the best feeling I have ever had. I really like this guy and I want to go out with him. I just got off the phone with him an hour ago and I wish I hadn't, but he had to go. I can't wait to see him because well he's awesome. He is one of those guys that you get chills when you kiss them... I love that. I feel like.. I don't even know. I feel happy like WOW! I hope he knows he makes me so happy. I hope I get to see him tomorrow because I don't know if I can handle another day without seeing him. I don't know what it is about him, but whatever it is I love it. He is so awesome. I'm not going to say I love him because that's a really strong word that you shouldn't say unless you absolutely mean it. I don't know if I love him, but I do know that I really really really like him. Yes, the three reallys were necessary. So here I am thinking about this boy and I can't stop and I don't want to. Soooooo TO EVERYONE WHO READS THIS: I feel good really good so message me Karbear11713 or leave a comment because I said so.

I also don't really talk/chill with bandos anymore and that makes me happy.  Hanging out with bandos made me sad.  Now I am happy and I do what I want.  School is ok, as in my grades are good.

Greg is super cool. Jeff and Greg picked me up from soccer. Well actually Greg smoked with Abe then Jeff went and got me and then we got Greg. When we went into the room they were in I wanted to smoke so bad. God, that would have been good. Oh well I'll resist temptation.  I was thinking that just one hit wouldn't hurt though. Maybe next time I'm with J and all them. So this whole changing my life style is gonna be a lot harder than I thought. I'll deal though, I don't really have a choice. I don't wanna go back to being fucked up. Sometimes I just get like so pissed because my views on everything are changing and I'm starting to like a lot of things I didn't used to. I guess I'm becoming responsible. I'm getting close to just being like fuck that and being a kid. How I was wasn't being a kid though, I don't know what it was. It wasn't good though but yeah....

Being responsible and choosing right over fun sucks ass, lemme tell ya. Like sometimes I just don't wanna move but I know I can't just sit there. My schedule has been pretty packed lately. I have been DIEING to see this certain somebody but something always comes up. Like between guitar lessons and practicing guitar and then soccer and babysitting everything seems so like busy I guess. I babysit till 12 then I have to get at least 2 hours of practice time in after that and sometimes I have a lesson for an hour in there and by the time im done with that I go to soccer till 8. O god... soccer... well I don't feel like im playing as good as I can. Actually I know I'm not playing as good as I can but by the time i get to soccer I'm mentally and physically exhausted. Luckily tomorrow is the last day i have to babysit so things wont suck as bad. But yeah for all of you out there who have been wondering ""Is Kara still a mother Fing  jerk?"" well the answer is no I don't do what I did anymore and I have realized that it makes things easier. I don't have to worry about getting in trouble anymore or anything. I just worry about things like ""Will I have enough time?"" and ""Am i going to be able to use my potential?"" or ""Will I do well an school?"" but most importantly ""Will I be able to get everyones respect back?"" And to anybody who cares: I sincerely apologize for screwing up so bad, I didn't realize i was hurting myself or the people who care about me. Sorry I really really am."

Death no longer scares me ever, it actually fascinates me.  What happens to us after we die?  That very question intrigues me so much that I would try death if I knew I could come back.  I bet a lot of you would think it is creepy and there is no way any of you could understand it.  It is just one of my things.  Like unsolved mysteries everyone is interested in those, as I am interested in death.  Murder and suicide being my two favorites.  I want to know what the murderers are thinking.  Don't they worry about what would happen to them if they die or are caught.  I think all spirits go to one place.  And don't you think the person who was murdered would take revenge on the murderer's soul soul.  I wonder what happens to people who commit suicide.  Like don't they feel remorse for what they have done?  You know like when they see their family crying and freaking out.  I don't know I'll leave you with this thought:What is going to happen to you?"

Dustin says I should just low carb with him. He doesn't get it. Plus, he has been low carbing for two years now. He initially lost 20 pounds, but has been in the same range for a year now. He lacks discipline. And so do I. Low carbing would not change my unhealthy relationship with food. First I need to incite real change from within. Post fast I will obviously initiate healthier eating habits, but first I need mental clarity."

"event","One of the flaws, or I don't know. One aspect of my personality that allows me to get into terrible relationships is my inability to hold onto grudges. For instance, someone made an offensive joke on a forum, and later apologized for it. I read the apology and thought ""fair enough"" and moved on, but others continued to respond angrily to him. Maybe it is a personal defect. Dustin has said plenty of hurtful things to me, some of them quite abhorrent. No normal person would just continue to take it. But the very next day I sweep it under the rug and forget about it. No more outrage, just a constant resentment below the surface."

"event","""When it comes to angry projection though, we are dealing with an entirely different situation. This is the out and out bully. He is deliberately attacking you with the objective of achieving control through fear and anger. There is also a good chance that what he is really doing is manouvering you into a conflict situation. This person wants to have a go at you, but wants to be able to blame you for it afterwards. By provoking an argument, he can achieve that quite nicely.

By the time that the fight finally ends 3 hours later, the chances are that you will not even remember that it all began with you trying to defend yourself against a wrongful and probably very ugly accusation. Even if you did remember, you'd be so exhausted by the awful fight that ensued that you'd be loath to go back and address it to set the record straight.

He has now achieved a number of things. He has intimidated you, he has manipulated you, he has emotionally drained you, he has effectively used you as a verbal and perhaps even physical punch bag and, he has controlled you and further empowered himself.""

"event","I mentioned that the kids and I were going to walk to the park, and Dustin responded to make sure not to let Violet run into the street at all and to hold her hand. This is the kind of stuff where I would probably sound crazy complaining about to someone who didn't know him. An outsider might think,""Aw, he's just protective. It's sweet."" But I find it to be patronizing. He is always giving me little tips like this, whether it's about parenting, gardening, cooking, photography - anything. Almost every kind of interaction he has with me is negative. There is the very clear verbal abuse. The kind that is loud and threatening with nasty names. He goes into narcissistic rages, and I'm glad I know the term for it now. There is the little jabs said in jovial tones so that he can make it clear that I'm a shrew who can't take a joke if I get upset. There is the gaslighting, trying to convince me that something I know to be true is wrong. There are the long-winded one sided conversations where he just talks and talks and talks about himself, or clothing, cigars, or scotch he is interested in. And there is the condescension and air of superiority whenever we are actually discussing me or something I am doing. 

So, yes, his comment may seem innocent, but it's not. And these kinds of comments are a real button pusher for me, and I'm sure he knows that. I wouldn't even tell a nanny or sitter ""don't let my two year old go in the street"" because that goes without saying."

Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows

Five for silver
Six for gold and
Seven for a secret never to be told

"event","Dustin was looking at old pictures of us the other day, and showed his coworkers, telling them (and several times me) that he took for granted how gorgeous I was back then. He said it again today, and acted surprised when I didn't lavish him with praise. I said that isn't a compliment, and it's rude that he keeps saying it. He said that no one is as attractive when they get older, and he's not sexist but I'm reacting like a typical woman, and he told his friend at work to date someone in their 20s - you want to be able to say you are dating a woman in her 20s for at least a few years, not 30s or 40s. As a woman who is turning 30 in a couple of months, he can fuck right off.  

He then went on to say that he has been nothing but nice to me lately and I need to stop with the attitude. You see, he has been watching The Office and decided that he is Jim and I am Pam, and claims he will start treating me better. In his mind he has been, but it is mostly the same old same old. Like last night when he knocked one of his shot glasses off the counter. He did clean it up, but he spent the whole time being nasty to me and the kids, and also blaming me for it. He first said the counter was too messy, when it wasn't. And then he complained that I put the bluetooth speaker in a stupid place - I haven't touched it. He was the one who had it out and then evidently put it there. 

He was telling me about his frenemy at work on the phone today. About how he is always stressed and hates his life, but we have a great life. He said that he was thinking about it and it's because I stay at home with the kids. His friend's wife works, but they both take care of their son. Dustin may as well be a funny Uncle who lives here and occasionally plays with the kids for a few minutes, and spends the rest of the time ignoring them or yelling at them. We don't have a great life, he does."

I already agreed to buy him a pork loin at the store, and now he's adding to the list. He only has $12 and wants to conserve it, which means I'll have to fill the tank too. So all of the money I have will have to go to gas and his stuff. I'm mostly good on groceries so it's not a major deal. But he had enough money to buy another box of cigars, whiskey, and fast food for himself last night. But I am the one he will lecture about being bad with money. It's just another example of his selfishness and complete desire to always put himself first. There was a point when we were on food stamps and struggling to even buy diapers for Miles when he was a baby, but Dustin always had enough to buy as much alcohol as he wanted. None of it is going to hangs and I've just enables it all these years, and it just really really sucks."

But he's trying to spin it like he is the responsible one, when he is the one who spends hundreds of dollars on liquor, cigars, and lunches out for himself with every paycheck. He gives me an allowance, and I've had to also spend on my credit cards to compensate for his spending. I am ashamed of myself though. I've definitely played a part in getting to this point, and I'm mad at myself. 
He gives me this allowance and we have separate accounts, but then he also wants to control how I spend it. Giving me s list of things to buy him, putting all of the grocery shopping on me as well as the electric bill, asking me to buy him this and that. And then wondering where all of my money has gone. He's mad that I paid a medical bill (along with credit card bills and the electricity, gifts for Violet's birthday) since I am now on a tight budget. I don't have a choice! He has no interest in paying these medical bills, and he spends money freely on luxuries for himself. If I don't pay them, they won't get paid. 

I had these detailed dreams last night and woke up strangled by sadness. I was at one of his family gatherings, and no one talked to me. Which is true to real life, but it was even more exaggerated. No one would even look at me. I saw Dustin and his sister chatting, but when I sat next to them they immediately got up and left. I went outside and started petting a dog, but it cried, it sounded like a baby, and Dustin angrily asked me what I did to it. 
My second dream was a little less bad, but I tear up when I think about it. I went back to az, and I was creeping around checking out my parents and where I grew up. I snuck into their new house, but they caught me. I was so embarrassed. They showed me around but I felt so awkward and out of place and alone. I got ready to go, and my dad told me that he was once like me. Thought that he was too bad and screwed up too bad, and that it was too late. But it wasn't. 
I guess my subconscious wants me to stop being such a sad sack and get on with it."

Like the other night when Miles was calling to him for help and Dustin was refusing. I merely stood up from my chair and Dustin said,""I'm handling it, you piece of shit!"" Or when he calls me names right in front of the kids. He has maxed out his credit cards again and turned to me to start paying for everything. Consequently, I am almost maxed out too. And now he is starting fights about how I am supposedly stingy with money, even though it is all HIS money. That I want things to be too separated and that's not how it is supposed to be. Note that he is the one who separated the money in the first place, but when he wants me to buy whatever he wants with my credit cards and my allowance the tables are turned. It's a real spit in the face when I HAVE paid for everything, but he claims it's not good enough because I had an attitude about it. 

Less threatening but an even bigger problem in my opinion, his consistently fucked up views about our children. He continues to insist that there is something wrong with Miles, that he is behind, his speech is ""bad"", kids will make fun of him in school, etc. He even admitted to me the other night that he hates when Miles pretends to be holding a fire hose or leaf blower or whatever, and just wishes he would pick up a toy to play with instead. That it's not normal. Dustin is the one who is not normal! An active imagination is wonderful, and he is trying to snuff it out because he thinks it's something to be embarrassed by. He is screwed up in the head and I am scared that he is going to ruin the kids. Miles is NOT behind and there is nothing wrong with him. I even took him to his pediatrician several months ago when Dustin was insisting that he was autistic, and the pediatrician thought that was crazy. She said he is a smart sweet boy, and he is right on track. I thought that would put the whole thing to rest, but Dustin thinks that I deceived her somehow into thinking Miles is okay when he's not. He also insists that he is behind physically when again - he isn't. But when I disagree, Dustin gets loud and angry and says that I know he is behind and that I'm a liar. It kills me that Miles is actually so smart, and his own dad doesn't believe in him. Dustin is never with the kids and doesn't even know what they're capable of. 

I hate that I'm failing the kids. Meanwhile I am immobilized and depressed, trapped in this situation. Now I have credit card debt on top of having no job or skills, hating my body. I have the best kids though. They are beautiful, smart, funny little people."

"event","I think I may want to do photography professionally at some point. My self doubt says that I've said that about pretty much every creative outlet. But it's something I'm really enjoying and continuously improving upon. I've spent so much time learning about photography, and I'm hungry for more. I don't know if I'll ever get to the point where I feel comfortable charging for it though. Considering how I always have my kids with me at this point, I can't even picture getting to photograph clients anyway. 

It's somewhat disappointing. I'll take pictures and think they are amazing at the time. I will fawn over them like they are my babies. But when I revisit them, I can't get past the flaws and they are not good enough. Personally, I think that is a good sign though. I belong to a ton of photography communities, especially on facebook. And I think I've outgrown the beginner type groups. It's aggravating to me, though at the same time I acknowledge that it's none of my business. But there are people in these groups who are definitely worse than me - and I am not a pro - but are out there charging for their services. And getting clients! It's weird. Blurry pictures, but someone will still buy them. And in these groups, people will ask for constructive criticism, but they are insincere or other people do not have the knowledge or cojones to actually impart cc. 

I just commented on one photo, suggesting that she crop some distracting leaves out of the corner, and someone immediately replied that I was too negative and the leaves were perfect. I mean, of course we should be nice. I am the queen of tact. But blowing smoke up your butt doesn't do you any good. I hate when I post images for cc and don't receive any. How else am I supposed to improve? So yes, it's truly none of my business. But I think those people are phonies. Though I am certainly not a professional, I have no desire for false accolades. Not that long ago I vented to my friends about some comments Dustin made about my photography. Of course they all flocked around to like and comment on my pictures. It was lovely of them, but I also hated it. Empty praise is worthless to me. And the insincerity kills me. Trying to build me up when I can see through pretenses is the biggest blow to the ego for me."

"event","So Dustin wasted a ton of money. I am surprised and not surprised at the same time. Our tax return was $3600. We had agreed that we woul each get $400 of fun money. I wanted the rest to go to bills and savings, Dustin did not. It was deposited in his account and he transferred $400 to me. He paid some bills, maybe $600 worth. He admitted that he had already spent his $400 and continued to spend. We got into a fight about it. Yet again I tried to explain to him that it's not HIS money. First of all, community property state. Secondly, we only got a return because of child tax credits and EIC, which we qualify for because we are married filing jointly with kids and our taxable income was less than $49,000. He reluctantly transfered $400 more but said that was it. 
We had set aside $1000 for moving expenses, but decided to renew our lease and save money instead. We had a long conversation where we agreed that he would put it toward his credit card instead, and I urged him not to spend it because the point of staying here is to work towards a better future and being in the position to buy a house. That was a week ago. He told me tonight that he is pretty much out of money. So that is $2200 + $700 from paychecks gone in one month. Ive never been this wife, but I'm going to try to check his statements when I can. He has bought a ton of scotch and cigars and ate out a lot. But other than that he has absolutely nothing to show for it. 
To recap, he lied right to my face and he basically stole from me.He feels entitled to do whatever he wants and he has no respect for me."

He wanted me to stay in there with them and watch them, and as usual kept interfering with hem playing with other kids. He also kept making ""jokes"" about how I should stay home before we left the house. He overheard his grandma and great aunt say that our kids are so great, and have great parenting. And he is taking full credit for that and so pleased with himself. I'm pleased too, of course, but I also am the one raising them. 

We have another thanksgiving tomorrow with his mom, meh. If he jokes that I should stay home I'm going to say okay. I'm totally not in the mood for whatever narcissistic move he's going to pull."

"event","I feel like he is always trying to tear me down, but he is just really ineffective at it. Luckily. It only damages my self confidence to a point. For instance, I had a drink tonight and he said that I'm becoming an alcoholic. That's one he loves to throw out every now and then, and it's utterly laughable coming from someone who drinks all night every night, someone who has put buying bourbon about the needs of his children I. The past. I'm not breastfeeding anymore, therefore I have an occasional drink. How terrible do you have to be to try to gaslight your supposed beloved in such a way?"

"event","Sometimes I fantasize about someone rescuing me from this self-imposed prison. I hate myself for it. And besides, I'm not worth being rescued. Every day I want to be better for my children, for myself, and every day I fail. 

He actually went out with us today. To a pumpkin fest I take Miles to every year, to Red Lobster, and then to his mom's house to hide off his tent in preparation for his upcoming camping trip. Tonight, he complained that I didn't give him enough accolades for going, especially for going to a restaurant with the kids - something he has never done. I started to say that the kids and I did like that he came, but he interrupted me to keep complaining about my lack of appreciation. 

Okay, but he also complained for the duration of the pumpkin fest, ran up a bill at red lobster and then told me to pay when the bill came (and is refusing to give me the money he agreed upon for groceries and my credit card balance), and was outside by himself when we went to his mom's. Who demands praise for just having s normal day with their family? 

He also really ruined any good will garnered with his behavior this evening. Overreacting and shouting and then spanking Miles, messaging me articles about football player head traumas when Violet bumped her head against the wall. He didn't even make sure she was okay before he started blaming me and lecturing me like a child. He was standing that I admit I was wrong and apologize. She fell and bumped her head! It's not something I did to her, but despite not even being in the room when it happened he insists it was due to my negligence. 

And then he went through every picture I posted of today on fb, critiquing and complaining. He got mad for not adding the caption he had told me to write on one, so I added it and then he called me stupid because the wording was not right. 

I always sweep everything under the rug, but then he acts sbusive and his true colors emerge. And it becomes clear how repulsive he is and how utterly foolish I am for sticking around to be someone's verbal punching bag."

Married to a Narcissist

5. <b>He doesn&rsquo;t care about your feelings, thoughts or ideas</b>.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Anything you say in relation to yourself will be <u>dismissed, ignored, or made fun of</u></span>. Your thoughts, opinions, and beliefs are all irrelevant to him, as he sees himself as the final word on you and your life. Your life is there to revolve around him. His attitude is &ldquo;What I want, feel, think or believe is all that matters, so I don&rsquo;t bother taking seriously what you say, especially when it differs from my thoughts or preferences.&rdquo; </b>This attitude can be so extreme he <u>may not even later recall you ever said anything at all.</u>



6. <b>Everything is always all about him

When you&rsquo;re married to a narcissist, <span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">everything is about him</span>, his wants, needs, and desires. Everything will be planned according to his schedule and wishes. If he doesn&rsquo;t want to go out that night, you won&rsquo;t, if he does, you will. And if you don&rsquo;t want to go, he will go without you and later start a big fight about it.

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">Conversations will be about him, about his day, his work, his hobbies, his friends.<u> If you try to interject about your own life, he will make that about him as well, by giving you advice on how you should have behaved in a situation (even if there </u></span></b><u><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>was</b></span><b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""> no problems) or by mocking or dismissing the events.</span> Pretty soon you will stop telling him about </b><b>yourself,</b></u><b><u> because the conversations go so poorly. It&rsquo;s easier to keep the conversations about him.</u></b>

7. He doesn&rsquo;t live by anyone else&rsquo;s rules

Narcissists feel that they are special and above others, so rules don&rsquo;t apply to them. <b>Standard social graces are optional, and he is entitled to judge everyone else on how they live.</b> Even, or maybe especially, expectations of the relationship by a partner are dismissed and the relationship becomes molded to the narcissists needs and desires, with the needs and desires of the partner being completely ignored. However, for himself, <b>he is allowed anything his heart desires and expects to be treated like a king with no consequences.</b>


8. He doesn&rsquo;t want to hear about your issues

<b>A narcissist will get upset or irritated if you start talking to them about your issues or concerns, especially if your concerns are over their behavior</b>.Do not expect to be able to have a &ldquo;talk&rdquo; with a narcissist if there is something bothering you about your relationship. <b><u>Anything you say will be taken as a personal attack and they will fight you aggressively over it.</u></b> Indeed, you may end up apologizing when in fact he was the one out of line.

Even if they don&rsquo;t take it personally, narcs have <b>no ability to empathize with another person and so cannot understand why you&rsquo;re upset. They will likely ignore your feelings since it has nothing to do with them</b> and you will end up hurt twice and confused as to why your partner has emotionally abandoned you.

9. <b>When you guys argue, it&rsquo;s<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><u> always your fault</u></span>

No matter what he has done, it comes back to being your fault.</b> If he&rsquo;s flirting with another woman, is because you were ignoring him. He will never admit blame or accept responsibility for his actions or the pain he has inflicted on you. BUT, you must apologize for distressing him even in the slightest of ways. He is <b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">quick to blame you for any foul mood or upset he may encounter</span>.</b> I can probably count on two hands the number of times the words I&rsquo;m sorry have crossed his lips in the last 12 years of our relationship. And<b> none of those were genuine apologies, it was just another attempt to mollify and control me.</b>



10. <b>If he&rsquo;s angry, it&rsquo;s also your fault

This is a common tactic of abusers, <span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">&ldquo;<u>You made me mad. I&rsquo;m only mad because you</u></span></b> &hellip; !&rdquo; <u><b>He accepts no responsibility for controlling his own temper or actions taken when angry, In fact, he blames the whole thing on you and the way you made him feel.</b></u> You may come away resolving to be a better wife/girlfriend to save the relationship, after all, you&rsquo;re the one breaking it! This is another way he controls you and manipulates you into staying under his thumb and accepting his abuse.



11. <u><b>Narcissists need to <span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">put you down to build themselves up.</span></b></u>

When you are married to a narcissist (or dating), they will<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><u><b> not treat you like an equal partner</b></u></span>. In fact, that is the opposite of what they want. <b>What they <span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">really want is someone to control</span>, an object, not a human with emotions and feelings. <span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">They won&rsquo;t like it if you&rsquo;re not performing</span> </b>(bringing in enough income, taking care of the house and/or children up to their standards, or generally not living up to whatever productive role they have assigned to you in their life), <b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">but they will hate it even more if you&rsquo;re better than them</span>.</b>

Narc&rsquo;s are <b>extremely competitive and need to be the best at whatever they do. </b>They will make you feel<u> </u><b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><u>like you&rsquo;re a child and they the parent </u></span>in whatever you&rsquo;re doing, even if you really do know more than they do on the subject or are indeed better at it than they are. They are extremely arrogant and cannot admit to not being the best at something.

<u>Anything you accomplish will be diminished or ignored, and <span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">anything he accomplishes will be praised and talked about FOREVER</span>.</u> Especially in situations where you are actually more proficient than he is.</b>


12. You constantly feel like you&rsquo;re walking on eggshells

One of the most frequent complaints when you&rsquo;re married to a narcissist is the feeling of walking on eggshells. <b>Anything you say or do could start a fight or be taken as an insult. Anything you don&rsquo;t say could be taken the same way, </b>so time spent together is constantly anxiety inducing for the partner of a narcissist. You feel as though you <b>might be attacked at any moment with accusations of how you haven&rsquo;t met their </b><b>expectations,</b><b> or have disappointed them in some way. Common &ldquo;communications&rdquo; include the use of aggression to express anger and rage</b>, which may also show up as physical abuse at the extreme end.

<b>I have gotten to the point of not accepting ANY emotion from him as genuine. Rage or &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;. </b>I don&rsquo;t relax in his presence, because he could change on a whim. <span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><u><b>Also, even when he&rsquo;s happy, he still manages to shoot little barbs and put downs at me</b></u></span>, especially in the company of his family or friends. <b>Being with him is exhausting</b>.



13. Your partner is <b>obsessed with control</b>

I have noticed in my relationship that <b>anytime</b><b> that he feels like control is slipping away</b> (I have a bank account he has no access to for my school loan, for instance), <b>his anger will surge and we have a big problem. </b>This does not have to be the subject of the argument. In the case of my school account, I have no ability to add him to the account, even if he were to ask. <b>So he will direct his anger in another direction and lash out at me for something else.</b>

Narcissists expect that they are the center of the universe and so should be able to control the outcome of any situation. <b>They expect to have people respond exactly as they want.</b>

This can show up in something as small as the guests at a party not responding in the way the narcissist expects, or <b>by you requesting his presence at an event he doesn&rsquo;t want to go to. While these might be events you or I might not even register, or would accept without another thought as part of a give and take relationship, the narcissist can experience this as a huge loss of control and take it as a personal insult.</b>

<b>This controlling may also show up in your finances. </b>Having a partner who manages your joint finances, tells you how things are financially and shares access your joint funds is a common relationship scenario. However, you&rsquo;ll notice that when your married to a narcissist, <span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>he may insist on controlling all the finances </b></span>without letting you have access to them, <b>may not communicate where the money is going, and might fly into a rage if you spend even $5 more than you/he expected. </b>This behavior is considered financial abuse and is another form of domestic violence. He uses your lack of available funds to further trap you in the relationship.



14. <b>Your partner never hesitates to confront you or others in social situations where he feels he has been wronged

The narcissist&rsquo;s first response is to confront, attack, blame and criticize. They never take any real responsibility for their actions or complaints you may have against them, instead turning the criticism back on you and making you the source of the problem, i.e. I only do this because you do that or that&rsquo;s nothing compared to this bad thing YOU have done. There is often no filter on their thoughts</b>, and they will not hesitate to make a scene in a public setting or with friends and family<i> (Dustin usually will hesitate to make a public </i><i>scene</i><i> though. His image and being perceived in a good light is his top priority)</i>. It can feel like you&rsquo;re watching a toddler throw a tantrum, yet everyone stands around and no-one knows what to do.

Now that I know his pattern and can see his behavior objectively (part of the time)<b> it&rsquo;s almost comical the lengths he will go to in his temper tantrums, and the horrible self-centered things that come out of his mouth. I believe narcs are never more of who they truly are than when they are in the grip of their rage.<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""> Pay attention to what they say in the heat of anger, it&rsquo;s probably the most honest they will ever be with you.</span></b>


15. Your partner is <b>unable to feel empathy for you and has great difficulty appreciating the feelings and needs of others</b>

While being married to a narcissist,<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b> I have repeatedly been shocked and disgusted by the comments he makes in passing concerning other people who have had something bad happen to them or have made a bad choice.</b></span> He constantly puts down &ldquo;fat&rdquo; (anyone over the ideal weight) people, &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; people, and anyone who attracts his attention for being &ldquo;less&rdquo; than himself. Watching the news is usually pretty disgusting, because of his comments. He has NO ability to even slightly imagine how he might feel in that situation. There is NO empathy for anyone, strangers, family, spouse, or children.<b> I often have to try and make him stop with the children as he is punishing them for having feelings he doesn&rsquo;t agree with. Yelling at your kid for crying does not help the problem!</b>

In your relationship, you may feel like <b>discussions are all about your partner&rsquo;s feelings, but very little, if any, </b><b>acknowledgement</b><b> is made of your feelings. You may frequently be left feeling frustrated and misunderstood by your partner and that your needs have not been taken into account</b>. (I spent many years thinking if I could just get him to understand how he was making me feel, he would stop. There were many wasted tears trying to talk to him about how he was hurting me, and many nights going to bed so confused because my attempts to talk turned into a huge fight and an inquisition of all the things I was doing that &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; him). You&rsquo;ve probably also spent a lot of time trying to calm and acknowledge your partner&rsquo;s feelings and make sure their needs are met.


16. Everything depends on them

When you&rsquo;re married to a narcissist, you cannot make plans unless he wants to, <b>you cannot hang out with your friends unless he is okay with it</b>, and basically everything you do depends on his opinion of it. One of the biggest signs you&rsquo;re with a narcissist is if <b>everything in your relationship depends on him and his opinion of things</b>. Look at your relationship objectively and see if you are allowed to take the lead on anything, or if it all is reliant on his opinions. <b>If he gives you a hard time or the cold shoulder for having a girls night (or if you have stopped having them altogether because </b><b>its</b><b> simpler to just stay home)</b>, if you can&rsquo;t make any plans without checking to see if he wants to, if he <b>puts off, stalls, or <span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">makes you late </span>to events you want to participate in,</b> you may have a narcissist on your hands.



17. <b>Constantly Needs Your Attention</b>

Narcs believe the world is all about them, your world especially should put his needs first. <b>They will constantly be requiring your attention, even after the arrival of a new baby and above the requirements of the children and yourself. <span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">Having a headache will not be an acceptable &ldquo;get out of sex&rdquo; card</span>, and no matter how busy you are, you should be sure to get his laundry, ironing, lunch, whatever, all ready for him.</b>

<b>Complements are mandatory, and you will need to keep them coming to him all the time</b>. My narcissist recently started texting me selfies expecting compliments, during the day. And the fact that I have not complemented his recently more muscled arms has been the subject of a fight or two. <b>They seem insecure, but in reality, they just want praise and for you to be admiring them and ignoring everyone else.</b>


18. <b>He Puts Himself First</b>

When you&rsquo;re married to a narcissist, <span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>he will put himself first, before any of your needs, before your kid&rsquo;s needs, before any financial obligations or work requirements. Before any saving or preparing for your future or getting out of debt. His </b></span><span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>needs,</b></span><span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b> wants, and image are his first priorities and everything else comes second.</b></span> He will spend money on things for himself and not pay the electric bill. <span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>He will be buying himself a new hat, or shirt, or recreational drug, and tell you &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have enough money&rdquo; for diapers or groceries.</b></span> <b>He believes he is more important than you, and that he deserves to treat himself because he works &ldquo;so hard&rdquo; for his money.<u> Any money you contribute to the family will also be considered his.</u></b>

Any needs you have that you bring to his attention, he will ignore, blow off, and/or be annoyed by. I have been told over and over again that all he hears from me is &ldquo;I want, I want, I want&rdquo;. When in reality I was telling him that we needed groceries, or that I needed new jeans because my one pair ripped, or that I needed something like glasses because it has been 4+ years. While he is spending thousands of dollars on tattoos (seriously).

<b>When they come and turn off the water, gas, or cable because he hasn&rsquo;t paid the bill, he will be annoyed that they could do something like that, not upset that you&rsquo;re now without water or heat until he pays the bill.</b>



19. You feel as though there is a dark cloud in your home.

This is probably number one for me. As an empath, I tend to pick up on others feelings. I can&rsquo;t even put a solid name to it, but it<b> feels as though there is a darkness in my home when he is here</b>. Anytime I did/do something he doesn&rsquo;t particularly like, it grows and takes over the entire atmosphere of the house. The<b> disapproval is almost tangible</b>, even when he says nothing. There is never acceptance or intimacy here."

He was not pleased by that, and even less so when I got approved for a second card that he had been denied. I, on the other hand, was thrilled. I've always been in the mind set that my credit was bad, and this was a boost to my self esteem, as silly as that may be. 

I had a sensible plan to just make a couple of small purchases on each card, and pay off the balances in full each month. I discussed this with Dustin at length, as well as how to build credit in general and some misconceptions he had about credit limits counting toward debt to income ratio. I knew that the odds were good that he would want to run up debt on my cards, but I wasn't going to let it happen. Yeah, right. Said the walking, talking doormat. 

He got paid, and paid all of the bills, but put one of them on his credit card. He had $100 left on his card, and declared that we would have a family trip to the mall. I expressed my trepidation and told him that he was acting irresponsibly (and yet he is constantly accusing me of being bad with money!), and he claimed that he would work over time and pay off the balance with his next check. After he maxed out his credit card and spent all of the cash, he insisted that it was time for me to do my part and not be selfish; use my credit cards and he would pay them off with his next check. He held onto one of them for over a week until his second card arrived, and the balance was $550. He didn't work over time, by the way. He gave me $300 for groceries and my credit card bill, and told me to put what I wanted toward it. I put $150 toward it, still leaving me with $400 of debt. And now I have to make $150 last for two weeks worth of groceries and household necessities. And he keeps trying to get me to make large purchases for him. 

I am so disappointed in myself for walking right into this trap. I should have declined to apply for the cards, or at the very least do it secretly. I thought I would be strong enough to stand my ground and not spend credit, but he backed me into a corner. He's already talking about going shopping together this weekend, and using my credit cards since I have higher limits. 

My friends insist that he is abusive and that I need to get out, and I know they're right. I feel like if he would just hit me, or hire a prostitute, or steal my credit cards and max them out - something indefensible, I could finally be free. I know that's stupid, and I can't even fully clarify why I feel that way. The kids are a big pet of it I guess, though I worry that they would be better off if we divorced too.

I've told him AGAIN that I'm not comfortable with how high my balance is, and I don't want to spend on them anymore. He got a second credit card, so he should be good to go. He agreed if that's what I want, but he agreed the several times we discussed it right after getting approved. I need to be stronger in my resolve, or this man will chew me up alive and spit me out."

I went to hide out in a dark room, and Josh Hansen walked in. We spoke briefly, but then Violet woke me up. It prompted a google search, but not much turned up. I haven't spoken to Josh since I left Nate. He used to be such a good friend. He confided once that he felt like he had ruined my life. He was the one who introduced me to Nate. That's sweet, but I did that all by my lonesome. 

My career as a freelance writer is perhaps over before it began. Who am I fooling? I'm not a writer. I'm not anything, other than a mediocre mother. At least I have some incentive to give it a go now. Dustin has every intention of running up my credit cards, and I am concerned that he will not pay them off. I am working on my credit; it's average now, but I think it could be in the good range within six months. It's very important to me. Therefore, I need to start earning income to ensure that one way or another the bill gets paid."

"event","I just realized that a year ago Dustin was laid off. We were on food stamps, bills piling up. What a change in just a year! We just bought a new car and came back from vacation. Whenever I get down on the status of my life, I need to just remind myself that it is steadily improving. Of course, I'm still married to a Narcissist who is often verbally abusive, who patronizes me and does not consider me an equal, who only uses me for sex and free childcare/housekeeping. I've made my bed though. Sometimes the guilt eats away at me. I don't want to expose my children to this emotional rot. But I just can't bring myself to the alternative yet. Which is worse - emotional instability or financial? I don't know, but I do know that if I left he could get 50/50 custody and have just as much influence on them, but without my supervision. My friend did offer me a place to stay, but the uncertainty was just too much for me. I don't want to rely on someone else in such a way. If things went South, I would have nowhere to live, no vehicle. That would be fine if I didn't have my babies to consider. 

Anyway, let's stop rehashing the same old sad story of how I've managed to fuck everything up for myself. Violet is turning into quite a spit fire. She is going to be the child who causes me to prematurely gray. I can just tell. But her antics make me laugh. 16 months and she already thinks she is queen bee. She now brings me books to read constantly. And will protest loudly if I don't immediately start reading, or even pick up the book again and shove it in my face. She cries every time I get to the last page. It's cute, but also exhausting. And Miles, my sweet mischievous boy...is driving me insane these days. I knew kids go through the why phase. But I didn't realize how completely asinine the majority of them are. For instance:

""Can I have a cookie?""
""No. The cookies are all gone.""
""Why are the cookies all gone?""
""Because you ate them all.""
""Why did you eat them all?""
""I didn't. YOU ate them all.""
""Why did I eat them all?""
""Because they taste good.""
""Why do they taste good?""
""Because they are full of sugar.""
""Why are they full of sugar?""
""...Go to your room.""

One of the most personally rewarding things about having kids is getting to relive things through their eyes. I get excited about the simple things again. I look forward to holidays. I'm already thinking about Halloween costumes. :P 

I've been looking into online work and applying to places. I pray that I hear back from something. I desperately need my own money that Dustin can't control. Sometimes I fantasize about winning the lottery or getting an inheritance, and then riding off into the sunset with my littles. But that's not reality and I need to be stronger."

He hasn't had a bank account for years because he owed them hundreds of dollars. He has been direct depositing into my account and carrying my debit card with him. He finally decided to pay it off. He wanted to open a new account and cut me off from his checks, give me an allowance. And their system didn't show that he owed anything. He got off scot free. 
I mentioned getting a job again and he said that he doesn't want me to until the kids are in school. But then it's always ""his"" money, ""his"" car, and so on.

I can't leave though, unless I want to do things the really hard way. I have no car, no savings, no career. Ugh. I hate that my children have to pay for the bad choices I've made.

Even if he wasn't verbally abusive and quite probably a giant narcissist, our relationship would probably be doomed. Or maybe not, I don't know. Our values and ideals are too different. He's all about living lavishly, wanting good cigars and scotch. Wearing expensive clothes - I guess to impress his coworkers because he has no interest in going out, buying expensive work out supplements. He refuses to budget, and since I don't have a job he considers it his money. We have no savings. We don't even have a sofa or dining room table, and he thinks me wanting a table is frivolous. All of my wants are frivolous, and they are never met because he blows through all the money. 

I am by no means a good wife. I am pretty unhappy, so I am probably a terrible one. If we get divorced I think I'm done with relationships. I always pick poorly, and maybe im just not meant to be with anyone."

"event","Unbelievable. Absolutely incredible. Dustin knew this would be a tight pay period for us since it's time to pay rent. But he ""needed"" work out supplements, and bought about half of the things he wants for $120. And then he spent $40 at the liquor store. I made a quick stop at the store for breakfast items, and spent $14. We had nothing in the house to eat. He had the nerve to quiz me on what I purchased! And then claimed that all of our money is gone and put the blame on me. He does this every pay period, but this time he has really sunk to a new level of ridiculousness. And then he added,""If I was single, or not even single but you weren't around, I could make the money last no problem. Will you go get me Whataburger?""

He also got a $40 Amazon card from work, and ""traded"" it to me in exchange for him buying supplements. I bought diapers and baby wipes, and one or two food items that were not prime pantry. I didn't want the fee that comes along with pantry items. He commented on what I bought today! Actually took the time to log in and look at the order to scrutinize my choices. He also checks the bank statement daily, not just to check the balance but to observe any purchases I have made. I know I need to make income of my own, but he has made it clear that he would expect me to start paying bills. I get the feeling that he would still control my earnings. 
Things are getting worse and worse. He is also constantly so incredibly rude and dismissive. He talks to me about the kids or his work or whatever, but when I try to respond he says he is done talking and putting his headphones back on. Not for fights, but regular conversing. Tonight he said something and I immediately responded, and he said with exasperation,""What? I can't hear you. I'm watching this.""

"event","Tonight Violet fell and bumped her mouth. She cried briefly, prolonged by Dustin storming into the room screaming and raging at me. Saying that I'm negligent and need to pay attention. That I'm a stupid bitch. Not even close to the worse things he has ever said to me. I told him that he didn't even know what happened, and he said it didn't matter, it was my fault and he really wanted to hit me. 

Neither of the kids have ever seriously been injured, but they are supposedly always getting hurt because of me.  He also says a baby should never bump their head; I shouldn't let that happen. Violet is cruising and standing, trying to get up the courage to walk. Her head is heavy. Bumping heads is exactly what a baby her age does. I remember he had me such a nervous wreck when Miles was a baby too. 

I know this marriage doesn't have longevity, but I'm like a deer in the headlights. I don't have a car of my own, or a viable career. I also worry about custody. This man has refused to ever step up. He counts his presence under the same roof as proof he is an upstanding father and husband, despite spending the majority of his time sitting at his computer with his headphones on. He has been alone with Miles for more than thirty minutes only a handful of times. The last was when I was seven months pregnant with Violet and had to go to l&d because I was having pains. I came home and he hadn't fed Miles anything, just plopped him in front of the tv, and Miles was soaked through his diaper. Dustin doesn't do diapers. Of course it was my fault for not changing him before I left...in distress for the hospital..driving myself. 

I'm sure he would step it up if we divorced, he would have to, but how much? That's assuming he would show up for visitation at all. It would be better for me if he just turns into a total deadbeat. Not better for my kids though. They need a dad. It's a lose lose hypothetical situation, and it scares me to death. 

I want to go back to school this summer or fall, and duel major in accounting and finance. Not the most exciting, but stable. I could minor in statistics or maybe economics, and possibly have a decent career. If such a thing is possible when starting out in your 30s. At first he acted supportive, but he is already dismissive, saying maybe in a few years. 

It's funny. He's always making remarks about others who have more than us because they have a TWO income household - hint hint - but when I offer to get a job working nights or weekends while he watches the kids he balks. I should just put them in daycare. Daycare is so expensive in our area. My salary would basically only cover daycare. And I'm so sick of his envy of his sister. Yes, they have nice cars and just bought a house. They have also had privileges I have lacked. His mom paid for his sister's college and nursing school. His mom, in fact, gave them $10k as a wedding gift, paid for their wedding, and gave his sister one of her credit cards to use at her discretion for years. His sister doesn't pay for child care because she has family willing and able to watch her kids. Brother in law has a finance degree. As opposed to my college drop out husband and my laughable culinary arts degree, and the complete lack of help I get from anyone. Yeah, unfortunately I am envious of his sister too. 

Verbal abuse is so weird. What a mind fuck. It's not concrete like physical violence. And it's not like it is like its portrayed in a lifetime movie. It's not a daily thing, though it is frequent. It's insidious and sly. It gets under your skin. My self esteem is shot. And it's strange how I often see through things he says, attempts to manipulate or gaslight me, but his words are still effective. I'm so pliable. It's disgusting. 

Well, his was supposed to be a purge of sorts, but instead I am just wallowing. I don't know what to do. Making a decision, standing on my own two feet, that takes courage and strength, and I'm lacking. I have never felt so lonely as when I am with him. I mean, of course I have my beautiful children, but they obviously can't fulfill a need for adult companionship. Like the crappy song says,""If I must be lonely, I think I'd rather be alone."""

Despite no longer living paycheck to paycheck, we are not saving money or working on fixing his bad credit. It's so frustrating and I need to take back some control in my life. 

I don't even have a car of my own. I can't sign the kids up for classes or even join the y. I'm not qualified for work that would cover more than child care, and he refuses to ""babysit"" the kids.

There is a lot that is right in my life too though. Mostly these two munchkins. Miles is 3.5 and Violet turned one on the 14th. Miles is sensitive and silly and imaginative. He is always pretending these days, complete with sound effects and miming. Violet is smart and determined. My aunt in law called her a spitfire at Easter, and I would have to agree.

I don't remember why I came back to this user name after so much time.  I had closed out my latest, thinking I was finished with livejournal, but then I popped over here out of curiosity or nostalgia.

A couple of weeks ago, Dustin spent hours trying to convince me why moving to Southern California would make perfect sense in a year or two.  It's a nice fantasy.  The only con I can think of is cost of living.  But that is a pretty hefty con.  I like to think about escaping the humid scorching hot Texas summers.  They go on for too long.  I moved here to be with him, so there is nothing tying me here.  If the opportunity arises I will not oppose him. I told him that if he is open to moving we should move to Oregon.  I have never even been to Oregon, but it seems beautiful.  And not hot.  But his career opportunities are primarily in California.  

I am rambling.  I had a rough night with the baby.  She's usually an amazing sleeper, sleeping for 7-9 hours uninterrupted at night.  But she kept waking up with gas, poor thing. She will be three months tomorrow, my sweet little baby.  Violet has brought so much joy to our lives.  We are so blessed.  The initial transition, for Miles especially, was rough but brief.  And Miles is such a character.  Every day he makes me laugh.  He's a stinker though.  Ugh, the other day he stood on his chair, and when I told him to get down he stage fell to the floor and said,""My leg! It's broken!"" I don't know how I'm going to survive when he is a three year old monster."

"event","Violet was born on April 14. She was 8lbs 14oz and 20"" ( at two months she is 12lbs 3oz and 24.5""!). I was scheduled to go in that night to be induced; I was to stay overnight with cervodil and then start the pitocin in the morning, just like Miles' birth. Instead, I checked in around 5pm and delivered at 6:17pm. I was unprepared to have an unmedicated labor, but it was amazing how much easier recovery was. It's funny - I never went into labor with Miles, so I just went off what they say about when to go to the hospital. Everyone says you will know when the time is right. They say you won't be able to walk or talk through the contractions. They are wrong. 

I've been a much stronger person this go around. I took her to Target the day after we came home from the hospital. We went to family celebrations for Easter when she was five and six days old. It's different when you have an older child. You have to be stronger because that is what is required. It helps that she is such an easy baby. So full of smiles and hardly cries, and she lives her sleep. Miles would cry when anyone else tried to hold him as a baby. I fell into cosleeping with him because he wouldn't sleep in his crib. 

Dustin has pleasantly surprised me too. I was concerned about how this baby would effect our marriage. We were miserable when Miles was a baby. But he has really stepped up. And he loves to hold Violet. He never really bonded with Miles until he was close to a year, but as I said Miles would cry if someone else held him. 

I think he is adjusting fairly well to being a big brother. There is a little bit of jealousy there, but he is mostly curious. He is always talking to her and asking if he can hold her. She cried when she got her shots yesterday, and he cried too. Poor dear. Unfortunately, he has decided he put off the terrible twos for long enough. I often look at his sweet sleeping face at night and feel as if I am failing him on a daily basis. Patience has never been my strong suit, and toddlers sure know how to test it. He has recently start frequently whining, and he may not survive to see three. Like nails on a chalkboard. The whining is accompanied by this ridiculous scrunched up face, which Dustin thinks us hilarious and encourages. Oy."

"event","Miles just asked me for a hug, and then said,""I lub you!"" 
I love him so much.  I can't believe he is going to be two in a couple of weeks.  I am so proud of him.  That is not the sort of thing I get to talk about that much.  People don't want to hear you brag about your kid.  But he is so smart! I was kind of worried about his speech for a while, and then all of a sudden he started talking in sentences.  And I discovered that all of the information he hears and sees has been retained.  He can name his colors, some shapes, count to 5, make all the animal noises.  He knows many letters; he doesn't say the whole song, but the letters he does say are in order.  I was singing it yesterday, and when I got to S, he sang the rest of it.  He says please, thank you, bless you, sorry, and excuse me - and he says them in context. 

He is also kind and mild-mannered. He is so gentle around smaller kids at the park, and if another kid is climbing up the slide he is about to go down he will wait until they move.  He happily eats his fruits and veggies.  My mil was snacking on a veggie tray the other day, and giving him cucumbers.  He asked for a pepper (red bell pepper), and she told him that he wouldn't like it.  He kept saying ""pepper"" and she kept telling him no.  I finally gave him a strip, and he ate it and asked for more.  That annoyed me.  Thanks, mil, now it is crystal clear why my husband is the pickiest eater.  

I am now in the second trimester.  This pregnancy has been tougher.  I feel stupid for complaining when I know people who suffer from HG their entire pregnancy.  I'm exhausted though.  I had morning sickness until 12 weeks, and then I caught a cold that lasted for almost two weeks.  I've been waking up with a headache every day now.  It's always something.  Dustin is surely tired of hearing that I don't feel good - I know I'm tired of saying it.  This baby still doesn't feel like a reality.  Maybe for a few minutes when I had a dating ultrasound.  I'm so looking forward to the anatomy scan at 20 weeks.  I hope I get to have it before Thanksgiving! I'll be 20 weeks right around then, and it would be so cool to get to announce gender on Tday.  If not, I'll just console myself with holiday food.  It's weird.  I've been so turned off by food in general, but I am practically slobbering just thinking about mashed potatoes, stuffing, pie, etc.  I can't wait!  I bet holiday food when you're pregnant is heavenly."

"event","I just want to take a moment to brag about how awesome Miles is.  He is so sweet and kind, and I hope the impending terrible twos don't wipe that out.  He is quite mellow for a toddler so far.  We were at the park today.  He, of course, had to have a stick in his hand.  And then we came across another toddler, also wielding a stick and they hung out for a while.  We saw the same boy later and he was stick-less.  Miles put his stick into the other boy's hand.  The other mom remarked that Miles must have a lot of practice around babies because he is so gentle.  I was filled with pride because that is not the case at all.  He is just a gentle soul. He never pushes or hits other kids, and he is careful and steps gingerly around those who are smaller than him.  

I think he will be such a great big brother.  And he is fascinated with babies.  Every time someone has a stroller or car seat at the park, he always tip toes by and tries to sneak peeks.  He is so cute.  

I feel like a less than stellar mom these days though.  I'm lacking energy, and I'm sick every day.  This pregnancy is so different and so much harder than the last.  Hopefully things will shape up once I make it out of the first trimester."

"event","I am in a deep funk. I need to make positive changes, but I am stuck. Why oh why did I divorce Nate and then marry a worse version of him? I need my head checked. 

If I at least still had my own vehicle it wouldn't be quite as difficult. I could get a job and put miles in day care, end of story. Dustin works 11-8 now, and it's a 40 minute commute. So I would need to find something that accommodates those hours near his work. Or work weekends, except he won't watch Miles. Perhaps I could force him, but then what kind of care would miles even be receiving? He is still in bed with yet another hangover right now, and when he finally rolls out of bed he will immediately sit at his computer and put on his headphones. 

He disgusts me. Even with counseling, I don't know that our relationship can be salvaged. Not that we are getting counseling. The bitterness and anger have stained everything, and even when he does something that doesn't totally suck I can't find it in me to be that happy about it. I know that I'm going about it wrong, that I should try lavishing him with praise, but instead I am irritated when he spends 15 minutes playing with miles and then claims he spent all day with him. 

He took the last two days off. He said it was because he deserves it. He has taken so much time off. He threatens to quit every day, but he's not looking for anything else. So stressful. We are staying with his mom, and apparently will always because he blows all of the money he makes instead of saving and paying off debt. He's perfectly happy with this non-life. And he's in there with the lights off all day, expecting me to keep miles out or to keep the lights off. 

He is 30 fucking years old, and he acts like a sullen teenager. Worse. I took miles to his cousins' house yesterday, and Dustin cussed me out the whole way there because I brought Miles' sandals instead of his sneakers. He is a fucking psycho."

"event","We go home tomorrow! I am ready to see my husband and get back to our routine, not to mention put this house of breakables and pets behind us. 

I am suddenly overburdened with guilt though. I have felt irritated with my grandmother for the past few days, and sometimes I'm sure it shows. Not cool. Who knows when I will see her again. She has been different this trip. Irritable and snappy. Alan just retired, and immediately broke his ankle, so she has taken on a lot more work. And the atmosphere is different with him always around. I thought it would be better when we go off on our own, but instead she has been quiet and distant. I think perhaps she is really not feeling well, but then she is talkative around others, so who knows. Maybe I just suck. 

I was disappointed in her though. Miles has lived sitting in my lap and riding the John Deere gator while we were here. She asked if she and Alan could take him without me so that I could ""have a break"" (a line my mother in law throws out, and I have even told my grandma about how it annoys me). I declined, she asked again later that day and was mad when I said no. I said that its not that I don't trust them, but Miles has deprecation anxiety and could have a fit when he sees that I'm not there. He could wiggle and fall. She just insisted they wouldn't let that happen. I feel like she should respect that I'm not comfortable with that, end of story. I expected better from her. That's more my mother in law's style. 

And then tonight, she asked if I would let Miles sit on my yncle'a lap on the gator, that he would probably get a huge kick out of that. I stupidly said maybe, just wanting to drop it. She of course got uppity when she asked me later and I said no. ""You told me maybe!"" Since when is maybe a yes, anyway. 

I think letting him on the gator is kind of dangerous in the first place, and I shouldn't have to justify my decision as the parent. 

Anyway, I'm feeling a little bad. I want to go out on a high note, and I just wish some aspects of the trip had been better."

"event","I am visiting family in IN, and I think the visit has gone on too long. Last year I came with my 3 month old and two weeks flew by so fast, so we made it three weeks this time. But I was ready to go home right at the two week mark. 

It's more difficult than I was prepared for, chasing my toddler around this completely non-child proof home. Up and down the stairs. Back and forth between the dog and cats. And my grandmother is becoming a crazy cat lady with each year that goes by. I like animals, but I don't want them on the counters or table, especially not during a meal. Yuck! 

It's also shattered the fantasy of having an escape route from a rather crappy marriage. I would be welcome to stay here, but it wouldn't be a healthy or pleasant situation. I have had minimal contact with Dustin, and I try to think of him positively. But I called him today and the illusion was shattered. He has been blowing through money even faster than normal. While the cat is away. 

I'm going to look for a job with the same hours as him, and put Miles in daycare. I left him in the toddler room of my family's church last Sunday. It was hard. He cried, I cried. But I can't keep going on like this. 

I so miss my youth. The future was just one big opportunity. And now I'm an adult locked in to all of my bad decisions. No escape into the upper middle class life ice always dreamed of. At this point it's time to face the facts. I might be down here in the gutter permanently. Maybe if I work hard enough my son at least will have better, be better, make better."

"event","My sweet baby is finally asleep. I only hope the late bed time doesn't lead to an early riser tomorrow. It's actually been a trying day. Miles opened the front door and made a run for it. He tried to touch the hot stove. He dragged a chair to the kitchen counter and climbed up on it. He made a pile of every shoe we own while I washed dishes, and then cried when I said we weren't going out yet. Man, toddlers these days. 

There were great moments too. I filled up his baby pool and he had a blast. We saw a mama deer and a tiny fawn! We went outside after dinner and I let him stay out until dusk. 

He is so smart and observant. I feel like I am constantly underestimating him. I asked him how many times he will go down the slide at the park tomorrow. We were walking a block over from our house. He trotted over a bit, and said,""There"" while pointing across the street at a house with a jungle gym way in the back of their yard. There are so many times when I point things out that he doesn't seem to be paying attention, but he actually is taking it all in. <p><br><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/link"">m.livejournal.com</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","It has been a while. I&#39;ve lost my flair for writing. And my desire. Or maybe I just don&#39;t want to look all of my past mistakes in the face.

I talked to Dustin about getting a weekend job tonight, and of course he was opposed. He doesn&#39;t want to watch Miles. There must have been red flags, but I never dreamed he would adopt this attitude towards fatherhood when I was pregnant. He is always professing how much he loves our son, but is unwilling to accept any responsibility for him. It&#39;s improving as Miles grows into a toddler, but still. It has taken a profound toll on our relationship. 

I have a student loan I defaulted on. If I could just start making payments on it, not only would they remove it from my credit, but after a period of time I would be eligible for student loans again. I could return to school and persue a career that would greatly benefit our family. Or allow me to stand on my own two feet. He says its not a priority right now. I&#39;m well aware that its not his priority. But I don&#39;t understand it. 

Anyway, I guess I&#39;m just throwing this out into the void. I think the Brandon sighting was just a drive by. I have a hard time expressing my feelings here, so I won&#39;t. It hardly matters anyway. His random note meant a lot though. It was nice to hear from him. Lord knows I&#39;m a sucker for nostalgia. 

Miles is snoring next to me. Baby snores. :) 
I so want to do right by him. I only hope I&#39;m equipped to raise him to be a million times better than me.&nbsp;"

I need like a 96 in Pre-Cal because i totally blew off this 6 weeks and now here it is to bite me in the ass. Oh well...
But in three days im done and then it's freaking summer man. This summer is wacko. I travel like all of June (Vegas, wedding- im an usher ;-), Washington, Chicago) and then I actually am gone all of July to JSA (nerd camp at Northwestern). It should be tight...

But then it will suck at the same time..."

And now at the prompt of Meghan it's time to play in it."

I went swimming today. First time this year, i guess thats special. I dont do the whole swimming thing tho. When I was like 4 we went swimming with some neighbors and their brat kid jumped on me and tried to drown me. Stupid kid. I think he was trying to play but the effect was the same and I think it has scared me... Oh well..
This weekend was cool. Watched Gothika last night and someone (I wont tell you who, but I mean you can guess) got scared and curled up and tried to pull the blanket over their head. Luckily I was there and was strong enough for both of us. 
Yeah that's right. And if anyone tells you different, they're lying.
Now to delay mowing some more..."

"event","Its raining and it looks so tight. Rain rules. Actually it was cooler before when it was just straight up dark. Lydia and i were coming back from the PALs thing and there was like a line of darkness over our neighborhood. I called Kate and made her look at the rain.

The best ive ever seen was last summer when the cloads were actually rolling on top of eachother like some heavenly treads or something. It was tight. I think Jon was with me, maybe Jojo...."

"event","Shew!  Life has been hectic, fun, and a pain here lately!  School sucks so bad!  I hate it and can't wait to get out! There is so much work to do and so little time it seems. I have been having lots of fun hanging out with Dewayne,  Jasmine, and all our friends though!  We are having a Halloween bash....Jas and I will be slutting it up (tastefully of course)!  HAHA!  I can't wait!  I am loosing my job at Centre Stage, but I have an interview on Thursday with Carter Cares (after-school program), so I will just have to wait and see how that goes..And the owner of this store near Centre Stage, called Leapfrogs and Ladybugs, offered me a very low hour part-time job!  I will find something!  Well..That's about all I know to say..No one reads this but Jas anyway (so hey girl!)."

"event","Yay!  Summer school is finally over!  And I ended up doing well in the class (either high B or a low A)  Now, I have like a two week break until fall semester starts and I plan on relaxing as much as possible.  My 21st Birthday is like a week and a half away (August 24th)!  YAY!  I am so excited!  All my friends and I are going live it up!  WHOO-HOO!  I can't wait!  I have been waiting for this birthday for a while..it sucks hanging out with people who are older than you are...Anyways, that is about all that has been happening so far...OH!  My baby got a job around here so he will not have to move for which I am so grateful!  I am so proud of him!  He is so awesone at his job and so confident in it all.  He's awesome!  Well, I guess I am out!  Talk to you later homies!"

"event","So I have not updated in a bit..so I figured what the heck!  I started a new class Monday.  I think it will be ok although I did fail my first test today.  I made so many stupid little mistakes!  ARGGGHHHHH!  Oh well!  I don't think I am going to get to go on vacation or anything...school!  Oh well!   Next summer it's on like donkey kong!  Beaches here I come!  Haha! Life has been pretty good lately...Hanging out with Dewayne, my family....that's about it!  I am broke as a joke too!  I have no $ in savings and the same in checking.  No more shopping for me!  Dewayne's bday is coming up and I have no clue what I am going to do.  When you have been with someone for almost five years, it's hard to come up with something new.  I'll figure it out though..but hey if anyone out there has some ideas, send them my way!  Well, I guess I will quit boring yall and split!  Holla!"

"event","Hey!  So I haven't updated in a few so I thought I would do that while I am bored at work.  The holiday weekend was fun.  I was off work so I got to do the normal weekend stuff on Saturday like shopping and such which was cool.  I went to a family cookout on Monday for lunch.  It was cool and there wasn't too much drama...I liked it!  Then me, Dewayne, Rick, and Curly went to Kingsport and met Kevin, Rachel, and Nathan at the Fourth of July celebration over there.  We missed the band we went to see and the people over there so jipped us on the beer garden but it was cool.  The last band that played was pretty good so that made up for some of it!  The fireworks were so pretty!  I loved them!  I had alot of fun!  Term 1 is almost over in summer school and then this Monday I start the second term...YUCK!  I have a math class which I am so dreading.  I am going to watch Jasmine on Saturday in Miss Kingsport so that should be fun!  Well, I am running out of things to say so I am out!"

"event","Wow!  It has been forever since I posted on this thing.  There has been alot going on that most people don't know about, and life has been life. I have never wanted to go on vacation so bad in my life.  I NEED to get away!  But oh well, I guess we don't always get what we want!  While I have had alot going on, I have also been so bored!  Work sucks because we aren't that busy and I end up just sitting around doing nothing!  I see Dewayne like two or three times a week, and the rest of the time I do other stuff and keep busy but I am still bored!  I don't understand that whatsoever!  Is that even possible-to be busy and bored at the same time?  I think I am just ready for some time off and something exciting to happen!  I don't know.  Maybe I should just quit whining.  Anyway, I got out of the online class from you know and school is cool now.  I made a B on my first Sociology exam, and I am satisfied since I don't listen to well in class and of coarse didn't study."

"event","I cannot wait for the weekend for some reason!  I am ready to say screw summer school and play all summer!  I need a vacation!!!  But, oh well!  You don't always get what you want!  I hope to get to see my boyfriend this weekend and go out with all our friends but that is not definite right now.  If not my Jazzy fizzle said she wouldn't let me down.  Oh!  I have to take the last two exams of the Praxis 2 on this coming Saturday so pray for me!  I haven't done much studying so it may not go too well!   I will just have to wait and see!  But I guess I have said all I have to say!  Have a good weekend!  Out!"

"event","So..It is almost time to start back to school.  Oh well, I am ready to get it over with!!!  Here the last few days, I have been so aggravated with my family.  They treat me like I am still in high school, not almost out of college.  It sucks!  If  I was wild and irresponsible I might get it, but anyone who knows me knows that it so not true.  I am ready to live it up and have a real college experience before it is over!  I mean I am almost 21 years old and I barley go out and do anything!  It's like the saying, 'You are only young once!'..well, I am not going to be this age ever again and it is time to live it up and have fun with my friends and boyfriend! I don't want to be that married woman who goes through a crisis of wanting to go out and party! I guess I am going to have to be a rebel and argue with them.  However, I know that I am lucky they care about me and I couldn't do college without their help.  There is no way I could pay all the expenses that go along with it.  Who knows..it blows though.  But otherwise things are cool..life is going okay!!  Well I guess I am out!!"

"event","Hello Jasmine!  I know you are probably the only person who reads this.  HAHA!  Oh well!  I am satisfied with life right now.  I am so glad it is summer!  I can't wait to go play in the sunshine (which I desperately need to do because I am sooo white)!  I am being so spacey here lately!  I think my brain has checked our for a vacation.  HAHA!  Not good!  I want to do something fun this summer...Anyone have any suggestions?  I would love to get away for a few days with my boyfriend and maybe some friends.   Somewhere warm and fun and beachy would be nice.  I don't know!  But I am going to go be productive at work and not sit on my butt!  HAHA!  See ya!"

"event","Well I figured everyone I know has one of these so why not start one myself!  Life is being life right now...I just had my car fixed on Thursday and the check engine light came on today on my way to work.  To steal a quote I read last night on the Internet..""It's not true that life is one darn thing after another; it is one darn thing over and over.""  Edna St. Vincent Millay (I made this a bit nicer!)  I am hanging out waiting on school to start back up!  Last year..It's kind of sad because that means it is time to grow up and get a real job but I can't wait to get out of school.  I made straight A's this semester..WHOO-HOO!  Go me!  I will get deans list!  Well I can't think of anything else to say, so I am out!  C-ya!"

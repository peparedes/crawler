"event","QUIT SPAMMING MY SHIT YOU FUCKING CUNT
I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T LIKE MALICE
OR IF YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S FUCKING HER EX HUSBAND
OR IF YOU'RE ONE OF HER LOSER EX BOYFRIENDS
YOUR LACK OF A LIFE AND LAME MS PAINT SKILLS
ARE FUCKING UP MY INBOX.  YEAH.  NO NOTES.
TRY SPAMMING THIS ONE YOU NO LIFE LOSER BITCH.
kthnx

EDIT: I checked my inbox this afternoon and had thirty messages with extremely long notes from several LJ users (same person, different accounts, I'm assuming) with some campaign to have me take off someone on my friends list.  I'm not really aggravated about that - it's kinda amusing - but it is a hassle to delete all of those e-mails (which are no longer relevant) and I have no intention of deleting someone from my friends list because some annonymous stalker keeps spamming my inbox.  I would have considered it if he or she had MAYBE taken the time to do some quality work on photoshop, but no, I have to get the one who would have a hard time making a ransom note out of magazine clip-outs.  So for future reference, although I'm not sure how often I'll be updating on this site, all entries are now friends only.  Oh LJ drama, you kill me."

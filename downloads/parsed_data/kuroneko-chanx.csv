a simple game of capture the flag...nothing can go wrong?....right? well you're wrong everything doesnt turn out right in yami and kaiba's drunken quest to capture all the flags. They'll face strong brandy, twins and giant kitty robots....all with the fast travel of their fully loaded golf cart. So emotions will rise and all dignity will be lost....but do watch out for the brandy....that stuff kills."

"event","well i've decided to write a small poem..type..thing because i have nothing better to do ummm anyway i'm thinking about using it in a fan fic (most likely a puppy shipper....gasp! crossover pairing vashXjonouchi!^_^) anyway here you go.
goodbye by me!
what do we live for?...i suppose the answer is clear you live to show me what could be and i live to burden you with my sorrow and lust. My lust...the lust no one knew of...damn me and my stubborn feelings...for once i'm actually expressing the feelings of my heart, my feelings for you. No matter how hard i try to make things right i always end up driving you away with idiotic and childish name calling and taunting...but what does it prove? that i'm better than you? no...it proves that i'm just not deserving of one such as you. The love i have for you burns with the blinding intensity of infinite suns...but it doesnt show...does it ever? in the slightest? of course not.....you're cheerful, and friendly...heh my exact opposites...whoever said opposites atract was a genius but at the same time deserves to die, like me....which is why by the time you're reading this my life will be nothing but a shadow in the back of your mind.
                                                   goodbye...my golden haired angel.

"event","....Hmm...it's weird...whenever i feel happy someone brings up something that just shoots my feelings into and endless abyss of sadness..Then i start writing tragic romantic fan fics where people can never be with their true love....it only made me realize that all happiness is is a figment of ones fantasy that's come true...for instance i've heard from every one that the first time they experianced love is the happiest day of their life...in retrospective everyones fantasy is to have someone to spend their life with and to cherish forever or to be loved.....so in reality sadness is just when that fantasy is interupted or taken away...another example why do we feel sad when a loved one dies? it's because the love and care of that person has left therefore the fantasy is broken and sadness is born. Perhaps it's just my point of view...as one as spaced out as i am......ahh ignorence is bliss, truely it is.....you dont have to deal with all the bad news..i just get wrapped up in my writing, pondering, and reading that the world is just another far away place.far away from my hopes and dreams and definatly far away from my interest. Hmmm i've run out of particularly philophsical things to talk about....wow..i'm relativly serious at 1:53 am... Ahh well. Friends: because it's the thing on my mind...and i've reread yugioh! duelist volume one and two over again...it's on my mind >_> hehe jonouchi master of talking to spirits.....all he needs is a rolled up newspaper or whatever...seriously this is exactly what he did. *rolls up magazine or some other paper type object turns to yugi and..* ""YO OTHER YUGI! CAN YOU HEAR ME?!"" ......right...off...topic...hehe ahem right friends...Friends are truely something special and anyone is lucky to have them..problem is what is a true friend? There's so many definitions...but here's mine. friend: *noun* person in which is dependible, honest, relative to you in some way and is well...friendly. ex: molly helped me with my test, like she promised, and we both got to go see a movie after words...she's a good friend. Hmmmmmm then again....a friend is also someone who can depend on you in some way...if it didnt go both ways it would simply be this ""slave"" you can trust, depend on, blah blah blah on them but you can be an ass to them with no benefits to them so why are they your friend? hmmmmmmm...i envy those who can make friends easily...yet at the same time i pity them. I have a few close friends...not many at all i dont mind really because then i dont have to memorize so many birthdays...i can barely remember what i did yesterday geez. Then again.....the more people you know the more connections you have....sigh.i remember back when i could make friends...back when i lived in oxford or or north branch....i've been to so many places friends are just..well...temporary objects in which provoke sadness. At school i'm carefree hyper anime addict nicole..at home i'm a lethargic, angry, sister hating, short fused, paranoid, horror and tragedy lover, quiet, little, girl named nicole........quite different i realize but hey..nobody's perfect and all who think they are should jump off a cliff for if they were perfect they would not die and if they didnt die..well...then they would be immortal and technicly being immortal isnt perfect for you see when you're immortal you experiance tragedy and tragedy provokes other emotions.......i know this because my cousin almost commited suicide...so in retrospective there's no such thing as perfect....so why bother saying you are if there's no way to be, just that, perfect. I suppose i shall leave you with one of my philosphys....man i cant spell...ahem life means nothing if you have no one to share it with, do not slink in the shadows waiting for them or worrying about their feelings..there's only one you so dont worry about the feelings of others mistakes will be made and hearts will be broken..but in the end it'll all be worth it knowing you didnt let your chance pass you by. thanks for reading."

On a lighter note, but not by much, i got to see the ring two...this movie made me realize we are all sick people...samara wanted a mom what did they do? her original mom, she was adopted, tried to drown her and when she thought she would have a mom rachel sealed her in the well, insulted her, burned her tape, and practicly spat on her grave....ohhhhh yeah....reeeaaall nice >_> hmph...yugioh duelist volume one cant even cure this...although..it is funny...but hell no one cares anymore.....if it has nothing to do with you screw it right? we're human beings not fricken animals...ok...so we all have different moods and feelings...well you know what i'm a pissed off little girl that thinks highly of herself and wishes, sometimes, for the world to be destroyed. And because of the news i'm scared of anything i dont go outside at all, i'm just paranoid....you know what...THAT's why i think i'm screwed up thats why i swear and cuss and that's why i think that mankind has taken a perpetual nose dive and will never cease until this crap is finished. To all of you complaining of your life..i have two things to say ""terry schiviao"" thank you for reading."

"event","Well. As an artist i'm always thinking my artwork is well.....bad. Yet at school people think my artwork is the best thing on the planet since sliced bread..ok bad ufamism (sp?) whatever. Anyway, i bet they would be good to show but i always get embarrassed about my artwork...heck today in class when i was giving my book report, *we had to build a scene from the book* i wouldnt show the class the scene..i didnt even want to show the teacher the scene...well it could be because i spent about an hour on it the day before it was due, even though i had a month. Well i was wondering if anyone can help me get over this......sighhhh that and i have an odd sense of humor and sometimes my artwork gets the awkward ""ooookkkkkkkk then"" and that really doesnt make me feel better....sigh."

"event","......a poem for those with my problems.
 Writers block,a creativity blocking slime, what a cruel fate to befall upon someone who's friends are always conviently absent at the wrong time. Creativity, is low and patience running thin. What a crappy dial up service, that my aunt is in. Nothing can help, not a person or thing...not friends, not games and definatly how birds sing. 4kids needs to die, funimation needs to be wounded and all other bad dubbers shall fry. Some people bash bakura, some people bash joey i bash tea gardner, and her name says it all Yugi should do the smart thing and make a call. To the police, the insane asylum, a hitman perhaps just please, oh please kill tea, i cant deal with this crap. My mom is ill tempered, my uncle is...drunk my sister is annoying well who would have thunk. This poem is bad, possibly forced but kingdom hearts is light......now..that was sad. My poem is finished and for those who agree, many things in the world piss me off as you can see."

"event","Hmmm...well nothing new really..exept that i am out of my emotional slump and is ready for more fanficage.....fan art too but i dont want to get into that. Well, i dont know about the rest of you but i cant wait for kingdom hearts two and the ring two. I loved the ring...it scared me and it was awesome..i think it scared me cuz the girl was a kid, and kid ghost scare me.....adult ghosts i have no problem with its those stupid kid ghosts. They dont even have to do anything, they can flash across the scene quickly and it will freak me out. Like those two girls in the shinning that went ""come play with us"" that scared me. 

I finnaly got to see ""saw"" it was cool, i liked it a lot....low budget and no Special fx but it was still cool...in fact i'm doing a little award thingy of movies i've seen recently...


Horror
best low budget film: evil dead trilogy
best plot line: saw
best one to freak you out: the ring
best nightmare enducer: ""It""
well i cant think of any more because i dont watch many movies.

Um for those of you who know about these ""movies in fifteen minuets"" and stuff......can you tell me how to do those because i think i could come up with some good video game ones...and movies..

in closing, when i die i want to be cremated but i do NOT want to be spread over the ocean, instead i wish to be sprinkled over the food of someone i dont like therefore i can make real use of the term ""eat me"""

"event","Well, i've found out a handy little peace of information. It's that kids 8 and under worship me, i dont know what it is the fact that i really dont like kids that much or the simple fact that they know something i dont know and they're really from another demension and they've come to suck out my brain!......but anyway i'll show you the reasoning for this erm assumption.

Whenever i'm at my aunts my two year old cousin follows me around, and if i go more that a foot away from her she screams at me to wait.....I cant even go to the bathroom without her screaming my name, as though the toilet was going to eat me or some garbage. Then, of course, is my overweight 8 year old cousin....she's twice my weight and as tall as me...at age eight. Anyway, she comes to my house periodicly i bet she isnt there more than two seconds before she starts searching the house for me.....i have to lock myself in the bathroom to protect myself from her...she's like a sumo wrestler!! she could probably kill me if she wanted to. In conclusion...keep them away from me!

and now some words that will make you ponder-if you choke a smurf what color will it turn?"

        New years....anime style.its a little late but oh well.

 yugi, jounouchi, kaiba, and for some reason kuroneko, were all gathered in kaiba's living room. Yugi, who had eatin a bit to many marshmallows, was laying on the couch watching jounouchi and kaiba play a game. Jounouchi scratched his head, ""GEEZ! this game is really really really confusing!!"" he yelled, looking from yugi to the tic tac toe game with kaiba. Kaiba giggled, ""haha! I like ponys!!"" Yugi covered his ears, ""come on guys...not so loud"" Kuroneko popped out of nowhere, ""Come on wuss you only had fifty marshmallows....er..i mean mrow"" said the cat. Jounouchi looked at the cat, "".......oh my god its puss in boots"" Kaiba blinked, ""i like ponys?"" Yugi shook his head, ""he's not wearing boots""  In jounouchis head jepardy music started to play, soon afterwards came his reply, ""what is....vermont?"" Kaiba sighed, ""i like-"" jounouchi,yugi, and kuroneko interupted him, ""We know...we know..ponys"" Kaiba grinned and shook his head, ""nope! wiffle balls!"" Yugi blinked ""i'm getting too old for this"" he said burying his face in the pillow. Jounouchi nodded, ""strangly enough....i like wiffle balls too"" Kuroneko blinked, ""...why do i feel as though this was a planned event made by some girls imagination"" Unfortunatly five minuets later kuroneko was found dead with a pencil through the back...he will be missed. The end."

Well to whom it may concern, i make fan art and fan fics. Recently i've been working on a series of fan fics that have me switching places with yugi from yugioh. 

Um also recently, i've decided that 4kids must be the dumbest thing on the planet since reality shows. After all...no one likes a bad dub, AND for all your reality show fans i would like to make one thing clear. Reality shows...do..the same thing over and over again, its repetative and annoying. nicholas: like anzu huh? heh...i have a ghost in my room that likes simple plan dont ask.

I know it may seem that i'm mean and stuff, but its just because a lot of things really make me mad in the world and the internet is the only place i can assert myself and come out of my shell. Ask any of my friends, they'll say i'm crazy, funny...possibly obsessed but thats a different story."

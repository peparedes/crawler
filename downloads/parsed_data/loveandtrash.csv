"event","I just remembered that I said I was going to post a better picture of the new bike.
Well, that obviously has not happened and I have continued to put it off for another day. I was trying to think of a good place to set up the bike for its portrait but it all sounded corny. 
Last night I was riding around with my camcorder and I thought of setting up a small tripod and filming myself riding the bike. That never happened and the now the idea just sounds like some dorky Edison short. 
I'm sure that Hils is the only one reading this (maybe, maybe not), but I'll have a pic of tomorrow. Should I make a film? Fancy with music? 
I'm seriously considering it for some Final Cut practice.

April and I have been experimenting with Digital Video Recorders, and I don't mean sexy stuff.
We're going to work on making short films together. 

Last night I watched ""William Eggleston in the Real World"" and his behavior behind the camera is very similar to April's. She gets completely lost in her imagination and interpretation of what is framed in the view finder. It is a strange silent confidence that can be hard for an impatient person like myself to witness.
hahah! April just said ""Oh, that's not good"", in her sleep.
I wish I had her patience and concentration. 

I really like this picture she took of Los Angeles:

I have 2 eight page papers due by the end of the week for 2 different classes and I can't focus. They're not difficult at all but I literally cannot stay seated and on task.
As a child I was diagnosed with ADHD and my parents ignored any and all suggestions for medication. Their son had a lot of energy and was ""fun"", as my mom put it. 
As a 27-year-old adult who cannot seem to stay on task while working on school assignments, I now have a serious concern. Do I need medicinal help?... at least to finish college?
While I'm working on my papers I often find myself getting up and pacing, drumming on myself, cutting fingernails, looking at myself make faces in a mirror....ANYTHING but focusing on the simple task at hand.
I had the entire day off today and I got 3 pages finished.
I did however find time to buy a new dirt devil and clean the apartment. I shopped for groceries and checked the PO BOX. I spent a lot of time making a nice lunch, and later a nice dinner when the time was right. The ""right"" time came an hour early in both cases.

I hear about people taking adderall and getting wonderful results and it makes me wonder if I'm missing out on an opportunity to make a temporary correction. I often wonder if this ""correction"" might help me be a better student. I've never considered behavioral drugs before but I just can't believe the lack of control I feel within myself.

any thoughts?
thanks."

On May 21st (1 day after my 27th birthday) I watched a video recording of me singing ""Travelin' Band"" and I can safely say that I will no longer be singing Creedence songs. I can't believe no one told me how terrible I am. 
April defends the moment by stating ""it was like falling in love with you all over again"".
I told April that I don't think she is using the word ""love"" correctly. She rejected that statement, quickly.
Last night I tried ""Scenes From an Italian Restaurant"" by Billy Joel. I think it is time for an early karaoke retirement for me.
...or at least a new game plan.
I've got a lot of heart and I take it seriously most of the time, but now I realize that only made things more comical for my friends.

the only thing that feels like summer is the weather, and even that is becoming alittle much.
i'm sweating at the moment.
this week is meant for the completion of my financial aid application and registering for some classes.
...tomorrow, in fact.

slayer pics soon. as soon as tina hooks it up.
movies:
 <i>you, me and Dupree</i> (decent)
<i>The lady in the water</i> (meh)
<i>Strangers with Candy</i> (hilarious, of crouse!)

after my bike ride i'll be enjoying music made by friends.
most of youcan't be there but you can listen!

"event","i decided to do a bit of studying at the mom & pop coffee house down the street. This place look pretty comfy from the outside and now that i'm inside with the WIFI i have to say that my assumption was correct. this place is great!
i have to confess that i am not much of a coffee drinker. if i drink anything from a coffeehouse it's usually something like an ice blended drink or frappaccino(sp?)...you know what i mean?
so i get in here and the idea was to order something similar to those, something sweet. i made a mistake.
i asked for an iced coffee. i saw the girl pour the black liquid into a small cup and pour in ice. she was right. that IS what i asked for, but not what i wanted.
DAMN!
so now i'm just sitting here enjoying my bitter drink and english reading journals.

<b>UPDATE:</b> the coffeehouse cat (i don't know it's name) ran up and is now sitting on my lap. well, more like leaning against the hip on the left side of me.
cats love me."

"event","played another show on saturday.
good times. bad acoustics in the venue. tio leo's lounge. the sow was $8. WHAT?!
the price of the show greatly affected the turn-out.
it was an art show but no one there was interested in art.
the crowd was a random scatter of PB people and old people eating chips and salsa. 
the opening bands ""we be the echo"" and ""tell us machina"" were good. 
BUCKFAST SUPERBEE was just lame and disrepectful. apparently these dudes have been playing together since '99. every song sounds the same...blah blah.
uninspiring!

we're taking alittle over a month off from shows to really get to work on the new material.
then long beach and pheonix can expect a visit."

i'm playing music with a band called Alta Voz.
i'm drumming of course.

things are going well with them. they seem to like my drumming so far.
if things go as planned i have my first show with them on april 3rd.
here's a link to those interested in the sound : 
www.myspace.com/altavozmusic
the drumming on the page is a drum machine. they made those recordings in Garage Band.
my actual drumming is more energetic and some rhythms are a bit different but it gives you a good idea.

A few hours ago I was flipping through the movie channels, waiting for my vegetable soup to cool alittle when IT happened. I came across the movie ""the Notebook"". I'd never seen the movie but I could not resist stopping there at the ""Encore"" movie channel to see how far along the movie was.
Damn IT! the movie was barely starting. We're talking opening credits, the story hasn't even begun. I tried to fight it... I REALLY did, but nothing else was on and I let the movie suck me in. 
I watched the whole damn thing. I really like this movie.... even if it made me feel really damn lonely.

in my opinion, it is the worst video game i have played in a long time.
the gameplay and aiming sucks. the storyline is ludicrous. i don't know what i'm trying to do, ultimately. i'm just making my way through the game running into characters played by dr. dre, eminem and others. the entire G-Unit plays themselves and it is just hilarious the way they shoot like gangster with the guns sideways, yelling things like ""that's right you fuckin' pussy!"" THERE IS A FUCKING SHIT LOAD OF CURSING IN THIS GAME AND I WAS ALITTLE SURPRISED. VIDEO GAMES HAVE CHANGED AND I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH I LIKE IT.
i must say, there are tons of fighting moves and guns. 

i should have rented call of duty 2

"event","Sorry it's been a while since i've wrote in my lj been busy doing assignments and stuff.  I  did some predicate logic at uni, pretty weird stuff.  Plus i'm still very happy, which is great. Just listening to Ron and chilling before work.  Anyone have any interesting thoughts on the war on Iraq? 
  It amazes me how all these so called ""socialists"" are protesting against war when we are fighting a fascist.  Also doesn't socialism mean everyone gets a slice of the cake and surely Sadam is stopping the ppl of Iraq having their slice and therefore socialists should be glad that we are liberating Iraq.  I think they need to get their argument straight before protesting...."

"event","Well its Saturday ""morning"" and I'm pretty hung over after a great night out at Ramshackle - (feeling the effects of 7 pints and going to bed at 4am).  I saw lots of random people that I used to know, which was pretty cool.  I'm really starting to feel the effects of not having my girlfriend around, only 13 days to go 'til I see her again!  Just listening to Ron Hawkins as usual , the live version of 'blur' is amazing - ""My minds a blur, a spinal spur, can't feel my feet below, behind, bewildered.....""."

"event","After living in despair for most of my life (sadly), i started to feel like nothing was ever gonna get better....until I met the most amazing girl in the universe (Anneka).  I love her loads and she makes me very happy. I would consult my dictionary/thesaurus for a list of nice things to say , but that would take too long.  I have a business management presentation to do tomorow and i don't know what i'm going to say yet, which is a prime example of my laziness towards uni. YAY no work tommorow so i'm going out to the Academy, breaking my liver is fun.  Anyway thinking about going to bed now, night xxx"

"event","I'm back home for the holidays.  I am missing my guy terribly.  He is in Virginia and I am here!  I want to talk to him so badly!  I am so lonely, especially at night!  We usually visit in the evenings, so this is going to take some getting used to!  I hope it gets better and that we can talk tomorrow!

He emailed me today!  I was so happy!"

"event","I had the best weekend ever!  My guy invited me to a party at his piano teachers house.  It was wonderful!  It was our first outing as a couple among his colleagues.  I had so much fun!  He was the perfect gentleman!  

Last night, he took me to dinner.  It was awesome.  We ate at DeAngelo's and it was very good.  He is such a sweetie!  After dinner, we came back and had some wine.  We also exchanged our Christmas gifts!  He wrote me a beautiful message in a card.  He also gave me a CD called Puccini Gala, because he knows that he is my favorite opera composer!  He gave me a copy of his favorite book to read, ""Of Mice and Men.""  It was the perfect gift!  The best that any guy has ever given me!

What is so interesting is that I gave him a CD of the highlights from La Boheme, a Puccini opera!  We gave eachother Puccini CD's!  Is that a sign or what?  I also spent all day yesterday baking cookies for his trip!  I also gave him a card with some pictures.  He seemed to enjoy his gifts and I am so glad!

I adore him!  He makes me completely happy!

He left for home this morning!  I woke up to see him off.  

Tina and I are both leaving tomorrow.  I am kind of glad to be going home, because with out Jonathan and Tina this place is lonely.  It will miss things around here, but it will be nice to see my family.  It is always wonderful to come back as well!

My guy says that he will keep in touch with me!  I am so happy!

Well, Tina and I are going to a movie, so gotta go!  Peace!"

"event","Well...  This is finals week!  The worst week of the semester!  Ahhh!  I have studied and I am as ready as I will ever be!  I am so ready for it to be over with.

My guy has been visiting me every evening, since we got back for Thanksgiving.  I enjoy his company so much!  I will miss him during the break.  We still have not had the moment to talk.  I want to tell him so much!  I care for him so much and want him to know!  It makes me crazy, because I have to keep it all to myself!  

In the past, the guys in my life convinced me what I should dae them.  This time I have actually fallen for a guy and he has fallen for me back!  It is so different.  Like nothing I have ever expereinced before in my life!  I hope thinks work for us.  I guess we will see.  He just makes me so happy.

Well...  It's back to work!  Then it's party time tomorrow night!  Oh yeah!"

"event","Well, I have a very nice weekend.  Last night, Jon and I hung out.  It was so much fun  We just talk and spend time together.  It's the best think in the whole wide world!  

He also mentioned last night that he is going into theory.  I was not sure if he would decide this or not.  This means he will stay here at this university.  I want him to do what makes him happy, so I didn't share my true feelings.  Which were, that I would miss him terribly.  I wanted him to do what is best for him.  It seems that his prof's are encouraging him to do this.  If this is what makes him happy, then I am happy.  

I am happy, because he is going to say here!  I was worried about our relationship, since distance is not always the best.  He is the guy that I have always been looking for, and I would not let him go so easily.  I felt that I would go wherever he is after I graduated.  Now I don't have to worry about him going away.

I am going to hear him play tonight.  I love to hear him.  He is so talented.  It's so impressive!  

Well...  I better go!  Peace!"

"event","My guy has finally gotten the courage to ask me to dinner!  I am so excited!  We usually just hang out, but he has finally asked me out on another date!  I am so happy!  

It is hard to tell how he feel sometime.  He is very mysterious.

Well...  I will be seeing him in a few minutes.  We are going to go for a walk.  Bye!"

"event","Well...  Friday, Jon and I went out for margaritas.  Last night we just hung out.  I really enjoy his company a whole lot and he enjoys mine.  I am really going to miss him during the break.

Today, I went out to the lake with my computer in hopes of getting some inspiration for a poem.  I have something, but nothing major.  Maybe I'll try later.

Well...  I think I will go now."

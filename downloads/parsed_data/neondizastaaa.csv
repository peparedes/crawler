"event","So I was gonna do it for 7 days but I ended a day early. I had minestrone soup this morning. But the krishna lunch killed me. It almost felt worse than the latter part of the cleanse. i won't bother with the details. Someone told me I lost weight. and it was confirmed today when my tight shorts fit and i didnt have to leave the top button undone. for anyone who is considering doin the cleanse. do not do it for weight loss...half of it is water weight. anyways i do feel like eating healthier, portioned meals. and im pumped for working out again. i have been missing that. For anyone who needs a guide for eating right and working out join the self challenge on www.self.com 

SO today is a pretty busy day but that's how i like it. 

8:30-12:35 class, krishna lunch, study
4 study for religions test
5:10- 6 internship meeting thing..doubt ill go 
work out
8 heal the world meeting at cse 220
study, shower, PROJECT RUNWAY WITH THE GIRLS (tony will be in jax, i hope he reads this)and maybe xs to begin my weekend!

In other good news, the ebay dispute i was having was resolved. I sold a pair of jeans that came out to $31 something and they guy said he didnt get them and he wanted his money back. i was stupid and shipped it without a tracking number. if it didnt get resolved by tomorrow he was gonna get his money automatically. but i just got a message from him saying he got the jeans. whew! im sellin 3 other things now. so hopefully  i'll have a few bucks in a week. 

Lotsa birthdays today...AYLIN! DANE! CAM! PURVI! i hope i didnt miss anyone. love to all"

"event","pretty uneventful lazy sunday. woke up pretty early again but not with as much energy as yesterday. i didnt feel bad either. i reread up on the master cleanse and am gonna go back to it in the strictest sense...cos we had cheated a lil by eating fruit and such. the reading made the whole thing more sense than ever. 

At night, eli, norma, winnie and i went to the atlantic for the photo exhibit which inspired me to get my pictures enlarged and printed on nice paper. we all decided we need to do art once a week at least for an hr b/c i was complaining about how there is so much i want to do but don't make time for. today was successful in that sense because emma came over and i used myriams sewing machine to make this big shirt fit me right. not quite a porject but took me a bit cos im not used to the sewing machine. anyways the shirt looks great. good weekend. did no hw. yay. gonna go get myself in bed now and read a lil."

"event","Today was AWESOME. I woke up at 8 30 and was full of energy. I laid in bed and red the magazine that annie gave me for valentines day. when i got up I realized how much energy I had. I cleaned my desk thorougly. like a mad woman infact. then i washed a sink load of dishes and wiped the kitchen down. i dumped out my back pack to clean that out but never really got to it. ohh yea i made alot of lists. i was going CRAZY. cos it was SUCH a beautiful day i had all the windows and doors open, as did my neighbors. i heard them downstairs so i went to see what was up. we all decided to spread blankets in the grass and read. I tried to teach myself spanish. Chris' family was in town so the boa constricter was out slithering around and his lil bro was running around. it was cute and fun. after i got to hot i lounged around the apt in my striped bathing suit and blue shorts that i love. of course i wasted a good amount of  time online. but earlier i got this crazy idea to paint my room. so yea. that happened. just one wall though. Danny helped me paint and he came up with the idea to paint random square on it. i must say it looks quite good."

"event","Overall things are going well. I mean of course there's always some bad things. but who wants to dwell on that? not me and not now. I actually had a valentine this year. It's been a long time since that has happened. I'm pretty happy. He's good to me. We went farahs for dinner and hookah then hung out with some friends. Last week I had 2 tests and a paper so I was really stressed but I did alright. A 80 % on the comp. politics test and 88% on my public relations test. not great but it's ok. I will be better about the next tests and i'll be fine.

I have a test and a paper due friday but I am already workin' on the reading instead of doing that night before thing like last week. The paper shouldn't be too bad.

Tomorrow I will begin a 10 day master cleanse which will clear out my toxins. kinda nervous, kinda excited. After that I want to make sure I eat really healthy and stay away from habits that are bad for my body. I have already been working out alot so i'm feeling good in that sense."

WED- pleasantly surprised by marc being in town. the whole night was weird though. house. limo. club. empty. shamrocks. car? stadium. cops! it was soooo late by the time i got to bed, but somehow i made it up to study chem in the AM and go to work. 

THUR- rough. i was so beat tired. after classes i went to the mall with annie and some people to check my work schedule at A&F and they had def switched out the huge posters of the models. so i snagged one and hid it in the shady mafia guy's carpet store. why does everything feel like a blur now? it was only a few days ago. but just lotsa chilling. april fools joke that didnt go as planned. but then more chillin at the apt. 

SAT- the plan was marc, billy, briton, and i were gonna meet up at jason's place around 7ish. that def didnt happen. esp the marc meeting up at jasons. i couldnt get a ride to jasons but then whoa who calls---JULIE! she and i went down to 5 pts and go to car.connection while waiting for the peeps. and i got the enon cd 75% off. freakin awesome. go track 5. so everyone gets there and we go to fuel for the evergreen terrace show. it was crazy but so much fun. i def crowd surfed for the first time---woooooot. so did j tuck. yay.

neond iz asta: hey
L: who is thid
neond iz asta: i got your sn off facebook when i searched for honor court
neond iz asta: my name is sipra
L: oh ok hi
neond iz asta: i was just wondering how honor court works
L: problems are first brough to the dean of students office...if the problem cannot be solved by the dean then the student gets an option between two courts...if they chose honor court a trial is arranged and a suggested ruling and or punishment is administered and the dean gets the final say
neond iz asta: what is the other court (other than honor court)
L: student judicary board i believe
neond iz asta: ohh ok, whats the difference
L: its the students choice which one it goes to...the judicary board deals with more everyday problems adn gets more cases
neond iz asta: ohh okay
neond iz asta: what are penalties you could get from honor court?
L: it varies with the crime and it also is up to the discretion of the dean
neond iz asta: ohh okay
neond iz asta: i think im at my last question
L: ...
neond iz asta: how can people be caught for cheatin on online classes?
L: lol i don't really know how to answer that..
L: many ways
L: theres no one specific method
L: i feel like they can catch people many ways
neond iz asta: hmm
neond iz asta: on webcT?
L: ha u got caught in the psychology class thing didn't u
neond iz asta: haha, close...im impressed that you know what im talkin about, my friend is in that class and we were just wondering how on earth someone could get caught
L: i have no idea
neond iz asta: but there are many methods?
L: i guess
neond iz asta: hmm okay
neond iz asta: do you know how the pysch kids got caught?

"event","so i havent updated in awhile. its hard gettin back into this because i feel like i should catch up but at the same time i guess i havent written in awhile because there hasnt been anything lj-worthy.

Junipr: ive made the executive decision to go out less and socialize less such that i dont have little freak outs, and its working, but i wont be able to stand it much longer and then im sure ill do somethign stupid
neond iz asta: ohh man maybe thats what i should do
neond iz asta: im gonna stop answering my phone so im not tempted to go out
Junipr: haha youre a social person...
Junipr: everyone is by nature, but you are a social person so its more in your nature, im not sure that will work out too well
neond iz asta: yea but still i feel like a fuck up
neond iz asta: i say it doesnt hurt to try

=====================================================

as sick as it sounds im almost jealous of her. i mean i feel bad and everything. it shouldnt have happened. but oh how id love to care about someONE so much that i say those things she said. i care about my friends and my family, alot actually. i always want to be there for them. if i ever knew that i was a let down as a friend id prolly hate myself for it.  

=====================================================

so the other day i got this idea about ""things working out in the end"". i have always been a strong believer in it but i couldnt account for everything before ""the end"". sometimes it feels like what's the point of the end being okay if everything on the way could suck. but its all persepective. being short term shafted is okay. NO QUOTE!!

every now and then you have to get yourself out of a rut. you cant wait for things to change. just change something small. like the type music youre listening to. stop waiting around for things. but be ready for when things happen. try not to be caught off guard.

last but not least...i know i complain alot. ALOT. a good indicator of how close of a friend you are is how much i complain to you. usually i complain about little stupid things, stuff that gets resolved in a short time. the really big stuff i usually pent up. but i guess even those things have to come out sometime. and the lucky one was marco. i really appreciate you, alot."

last night i was on the phone with someone i care about and miss alot. and that person didnt even know it but by the end of the convo i was tearing up. you did say the best thing tonight. i asked that you tell me to stop the way i was acting.

(i remember saying immense cos after i said it was like what kinda word did i pick)<BR>::people start raising glasses, general commontion:: also, ...im not done guys...we were <BR>just talking and we think this should be a tradition done ever thanksgiving break...so heres<BR>to friends getting together. cheers!""</P>
<P><STRONG>SUN<BR></STRONG>today was blah. we meant to leave by 10 in the am but that didnt happen. eventually we got into this situation where my mom was like take the greyhound back. i was humored by the whole situation. not just the greyhound part. one sad note of the weekend. i did not get to see will, but hopefully he'll come to jax over winterbreak. i did get his dormline # from his dad so ill holla at him. ohhi just remembered another thing, i didnt see mehul...got lost in downtown for the bitch.&nbsp;&nbsp; : D but id do it again.<BR>i got back and no one was here. i chilled with emily and erin. i have the coolest RA ever.</P>

"event","Wow, I can't believe how much time has gone by. Everything's been pretty cool for me and I haven't heard anything from him since then, so I guess I can start easing up about a lot of stuff. The cops haven't told me much, just that he's locked away, but they don't want me to think about it. It's nice of them and all, but without knowing how long he's gonna be in jail, I still get scared when the phone rings."

"event","Yeah it's been 6 months now, and I guess I'm doing better. I mean, he's in jail, what can he really do? I still miss Tiff. Things were probably going to work out so that we could be friends again. I know that would've made S. happy. I guess it would've made me happy too. Sucks that we won't ever have that chance now. Bobby's been a big help with everything, and I can even forgive his stupid mistake. It just doesn't seem that important now."

"event","So it's been over 2 weeks now since I babysat for the Mandrakis's. I got out of the hospital like 4 days later, maybe it was 5, I don't even know anymore, but ever since then, no matter where I go or what I do, I'm always looking over my shoulder. I jump every time the phone rings, thinking it's gonna be him."

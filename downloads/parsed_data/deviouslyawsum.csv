You are a gentle soul, with good intentions toward everyone.
Selfless and kind, you have great faith in people.
Sometimes this faith can lead to disappoinment in the long run.
No matter what, you deal with everything in a calm and balanced way.

You are a good interpreter, very sensitive, intuitive, caring, and gentle.
Concerned about the world, you are good at predicting people's feelings.
A seeker of wisdom, you are a life long learner looking for purpose and meaning.
You are a great thinker and communicator, but not necessarily a doer.

Your personality is lunar. You shine when others<br>share themselves with you, and are lonely when<br>they are not. Your friends probably perceive<br>you as aloof, and cast you in the role of wise<br>counselor. They may be unaware how much they<br>really mean to you.

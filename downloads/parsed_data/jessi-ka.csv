"event","yea so ive been out of school for a while doin homeschool and i have a job and a wonderful b/f, who i am completely in love with. I dunno i feel like maybe i should have stayed in school u know go through the high school thing go to prom and all that but then i also think wat the hell am i talking about high school sucked the people are morons and the teachers dont know what their teaching.. So i guess i am glad i do homeschool..i get more time to myself to just think and be alone, and spend all the time i want (well kinda all the time depending if i have a ride) with my b.f. So yea anywho...today i talked to dana and he asked me wat i wanted in life and to be honest i didnt know wat to say, i really want to be happy and not be so angry and defensive all the time cause i am really defensive and angry and i cant help it, sometimes i like to be angry cause it gives me something to do anyway anough about all that...... well dana my wonderful b/f built me my own computer but sadly aol wont freaking work on it its lame as shyt and i called aol but the people their are freaking ignorant as hell and dont know wat their talking about, dana (being smart) doesnt have aol, he has DSL, so he couldnt help me figure it out and get this my mom called this guy who works with computers his occupation is computers and he didnt know wat to do. But dana said its not his fault he doesnt know cause smart people dont use aol so im gonna get DSL put on my computer and pay $25 and elisa is gonna pay $25 so if u are smart and can count thats $50 a month, but since i have a job thats no big deal. I really want to get a yoga tape so i can do yoga again...yea anyway im gonna go cause im bored and tired so ttyl bye I LOVE DANA FOREVER

"event","Hell-o I saw my wonderful boyfriend again today. This time we did school work kinda swam and watched a movie. (Riding in Cars with Boys) we didnt get to finish it cause i had to leave:(, Which really sucked. O-well. Im almost done with my literacture course. IM BORED!! nothing exciting happens in Georgia and all the teenagers are getting soo bored that they just smoke or screw eachother. Something big needs to happen. I mean really there is like nothing to do in Georgia! This is the most boring state in the world. well actually its probably not but it is really boring :( I wonder why so many kids are failing school since their is nothing to do you would think all we did was school work, but some how we manage to not complete our schoolwork and actually find something more entertaining to do. So many people are dropping out of school and doing homeschool. I dont know why so many people are doing it, its soo boring. I only dropped out cause i got in so much trouble and i hated it. I mean i miss my friends. I really need a hair cut, my hair is soo long now. Im only getting it trimed. I want it to be really long, but i have split ends and i need them gone in order for my hair to really grow good. Man i really hope sami doesnt come back to Georgia she was soo annoying i really dont like my cousin. I dont like more people coming into my house. She had such an annoying laugh. My mom didnt like her either and my dad didnt like her to much either, lol dont blame them she was a pretty big slut. lol s.s. inside joke with me and alicia. 
 anyway im bored so im gonna go later goodnight"

"event","<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be asleep. I should be tired. Exhausted even.&nbsp; I have family coming from out of town next week and I have been re-cleaning my house.&nbsp; C is getting tired of me asking him to help me with the garage. Oh..... yeah, getting married on the 24th. &nbsp; Hm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *sigh *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't mean to sound like an old pro, but jeez..... I <strong><em>have</em></strong> done this before. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He hasn't. &nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, there he lies, asleep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not so much. Why am I awake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not nervous about marrying this man. Not jittery. I get to marry my best friend next week and I can't seem to sleep.&nbsp; <em><strong>This</strong></em> is why we aren't having a big wedding, just a small JP thing.&nbsp; I&nbsp; can't stand being the center of attention even for just one day, one hour. So why, since we are doing this as low-key as humanly possible, am I stressing?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His family is incredible. His mother is by far one of the best people I have ever gotten to know.&nbsp; She is my friend.... how cool is that?&nbsp; His dad.... well lets just say that if there was an award for 'Best Gay Impersonation'...well, he'd be nominated at least. My father is a lifelong Dem, and I describe my future father-in-law as the 'coolest Republican I know'. He is a good human being.&nbsp; His brother... well I don't know him very well yet, but after reading his blogs, damn!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp; I want to literally pick his brain. And don't get me started on his brothers wife. She is possibly the most endearing person I have ever met.... she has this light about her. I never had a close relationship with my older sister. I was more like muck she couldn't get off her shoes, couldn't wait to be rid of me. When I first met my future sister-in-law, I was secretly ecstatic. We got along and she kinda felt like the big sister I always hoped I would have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that's the problem.&nbsp; Maybe it's his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't do well with people.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to a job, yes, but a lasting relationship with relatives etc..... no.&nbsp; I don't know how, but I don't do well with my family.&nbsp; I find now that as an adult I have a hard time being the real me with people. &nbsp;My mother didn't like me. My sister didn't like me. My little brother tried to keep the peace, but he was always a mamma's boy so... we didn't like each other very much. I was a daddy's girl and even <em><strong>we</strong></em> didn't always get along.&nbsp; I was the odd one of the family.&nbsp; I didn't do things the way they did and I certainly didn't have the same thinking process.&nbsp; My family and I are not close, and unfortunately, due to some misplaced good intentions, we will never be.&nbsp; I don't know if they would agree, but I will never be able to have that kind of a relationship with them. I care about them and love them, but some things are just not forgettable. Forgiveable?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but not forgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been without the closeness of a family type environment for about 10 years. Longer actually. The awkwardness between my family and I started way earlier than that but I would say the 'fall-out' was beginning about 10 years ago.&nbsp; Most of my adult life.&nbsp; Never really bothered me because I spent most of what I can remember of my childhood trying to gain their love and approval. Maybe that is why I can't sleep.&nbsp; I am 32..... shouldn't I be past this...? Why don't I feel worthy of being a part of a wonderful family like this? Why am I scared that I might reprise the role as 'black sheep'? I have no confidence. Damn I wish I was better with people!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am starting to worry about things. I know that no family is perfect or without it's share of problem's, but C's is a lot closer than mine. My mother, who can't go to bed without at least 4 vodka/cran and a good cry on the back porch, may be bipolar.&nbsp; She is on that back porch nightly.....crying. &nbsp; My father was a man who worked with his hands for 37 years, Tool&amp;Dye, also an inventor on the side. Now he is totally blind in one eye and only has about 20% of his vision left in the other. He just sleeps now. No real reason for getting up. My sister is a great mother, wife and friend. Not to me, but I hear this from everyone around her. I swear she thinks I am the anit-Christ.  Sad thing is that I barely have any memory before the 4th grade and even that is strecthing it.&nbsp; But as long as I <em>can </em>remember she has hated me.&nbsp; I really wish I knew what I had done so terribly wrong all those years ago, but she isn't giving it up. Whatever.&nbsp; My brother is ....well, <strong><em>tries to be</em></strong>, neutral. He really does. He doen't realize how much he sounds like my mother when he is trying to be neutral, but I know he can't help it.&nbsp; He loves my mom, he and sis both do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..... well lets just say that they decided that, when it comes time, I get dad.....they will take care of mom. They don't get along with dad so well.&nbsp; My uncle is an alchololic cokehead and he has Barbie as a girlfriend.... I don't even know how my cousins are. Haven't seen tham since one of them was on meth while the other was stealing uncle's credit cards and rackingup about 25k in debt.&nbsp; Wow.... nice. What a wonderful family. ........all these - just a few examples of what i feel <em>comfortable </em>writing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know C's family is not like this. Not perfect, but certainly closer than mine. They will soon be my family and yet i am afraid. Not of them turning out to be like my family, but of me being a product of my family. My family is a little warped.&nbsp; I have spent my life trying to be my own person... but what if the crazy is in my genes..... Oh damn...&nbsp; I gotta stop.............. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />"

"event","I sit here at home. Alone. Again. eh. <br /><br />I wonder why it is so hard for me to make friends with anyone. I have friends, its just that they either live in another state or don't have my work schedule. I am hesitant to make new ones though. I meet people (at work or otherwise) all of the time. People with same interests, values and ideas. Why do I keep them so far away....at arms length. I like them for the things that I can TELL that I like, but the fear of everything else keeps me from taking something from friend-ly to just plain friend. I know, risks....but should friends be risky?&nbsp; Or is it me......<br /><br />I feel that there might be something really wrong with me. My judgment has become impaired somehow. I can't even begin to tell you what went wrong but something is not right.&nbsp; Can it be that I can no longer tell the difference between desirable and undesirable characteristics? Too many times in the past few years I have been thrown for a loop by people I trusted to be friends (or even friendly). This latest one though, has thrown me for a corkscrew!!!!!<br /><br />I don't understand why you would do it, really. I am not related to you. I am not a friend of yours. You barely know my name. I have seen and spoken briefly to you at a couple of his family events.&nbsp; So why would you? You knew you were lying when you did it. You knew there was no truth to it. But you did it anyways. And you don't even know me.<br /><br />My relationship with Nat. My relationship with him. All jeopardized by your lies. Not anymore though. Truth is known.<br /><br />Now,....... now my relationship with his family could be in jeopardy.&nbsp; What if we tell you what we really think and you get pissed and start a holy war? Apparently there is fear of that. Not by me, since I don't even know you, but he is worried.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there it stands.&nbsp; Enough.<br /><br />I know I have a problem with trust. I don't believe honesty exists as a whole within us anymore. Do we all have <i><b>something</b></i> that we <i><b>are not</b></i> completely honest about?&nbsp; I think so. And it can range anywhere from something like ""I never told you that when we were kids....."" to the ""well there was that time when I was in the mental ward, but that was a total misunderstanding......"" <br />&nbsp;"

"event","<font size=""3""><font size=""2"">I don't even know how to start this entry. I think my communication skills must have gone on vacation because everything I am saying today is wrong somehow. <br /><br />NO, I have not started thinking that because you do what you do for a living that you are no longer good enough for me. I am just trying to get you to see that&nbsp; it is time for some security. With your job there is none. You have enough college behind you to justify an entry level position somewhere.... use it! You are too smart and talented to be where you are at your age. It is time for stability. The money rolls in later. <br /><br />No, I do not believe that because I disagree with you that it automatically means that I am not being supportive. That is just crap. And very unfair. So very unfair.<br /><br />I miss seeing you. I miss hanging out with my best friend. I feel like we are living 2 very different lifestyles which makes it hard to have a common conversation. We haven't dated in awhile. When would we? <br /><br />Do not turn my words on me. You are scared. Say so. Trying something new is scary. You will face rejection and you will actually get praise as well. I know it is new and frightening... I went through it too! The only thing you can do is learn from your mistakes and improve yourself however necessary for an employer.&nbsp; There. That is the secret. It's up to you.<br /><br />I got nothing else. <br /></font><br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""3"">I can't seem to clear my head.&nbsp; No idea how to feel about it all. I just got back last week from seeing my parents for the first time since Christmas '03. I can't even begin to wrap my head around it. Hopefully this will help.<br /><br />I do not want to be like them. I don't want to be that person. Cynical. I want to believe that they are generally nice people. They are. As long as they get what they want. They have it now. <br /><br />They were nice enough, seemed to be more hospitality than a visit to see your family. Kinda creepy. <br /><br />Last time I saw them they were aligning themselves with my ex-husband, he is a vile human. I know that sounds normal of an ex-wife to hate her ex. I see him and I see manipulation at it's finest. He is abusive. His talents include holding down his wife and putting a pillow over her face, sending his wife down the stairs, and calling his wife (while she is pregnant) a Beached Whale. He would only refer to his wife as BW. <i>This is who my parents want to have custody of my children.</i> He has been better lately, now that he has power over me again. Thanks to my family. <br /><br />And that is why seeing them made my stomach uneasy. Actually, it ached all week. I see him every time I look at them. How can they not know? How can my family have no clue about their new ""ally"".<br /><br />They had a common goal, sorta. For my family - get me to do what they want, and for my ex - to have control.&nbsp; A unique combination. I just don't know what I can do or feel. Powerlessness, it's easy to succumb to. <br /><br />My daughter says she wants to be here with me. What makes me sure of her intelligence, she gets it already. She came home a the end of last summer asking me if my mother ever spent practically every night after the sun goes down crying on the porch, drinking her Vodka mixers. (uh... yeah, daily)<br /><br />It was easy all this time to just succumb, I must be the crazy, weird child they say I am. My ray of hope came at that moment after last summer, when my daughter came home. She saw it too. My mother is bipolar, just don't tell her. My father can't stand up to her. My sister is my mother, with more contempt for life (me).&nbsp; My brother, a sweetie, although he tends to preach. <br /><br />And again... here I am. I can't stand to think about it. I can't stand to not think about it. I can't sort it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just want peace. Pull myself out of this funk .... I can't.&nbsp; I just end up feeling numb.<br /><br />Uh! Back to square one. </font>"

"event","So I am sitting here.&nbsp; Have been all day.&nbsp; Just had surgery yesterday.&nbsp; Talked to my mother ... one of the first conversations that I have been able to have with her in a long time.&nbsp; It makes me feel weak.&nbsp; I can't believe that I still feel this way.&nbsp; Why after 30 years do I still want their approval?&nbsp; It never mattered growing up. I always marched to the beat of a different drummer.&nbsp; Is that why? Could it really be why..... must I be like them to be a part of it all? Why are these stupid questions running around in my head?!?!&nbsp; 

So comes the paradox... be you or be a version of you.&nbsp; Why should there even be a choice?&nbsp; Parents are supposed to love you. You.&nbsp; I should be happy being me.&nbsp; I miss them.&nbsp; Dad won't be around too much longer.&nbsp; Mom is still kicking too many drinks back. I think I heard some slurring last night on the phone, but I said nothing. Nothing.&nbsp; Already.... 5 minutes on the phone with them and already I am changing who I am. Why do I do this to myself? 

I have a good life. Nothing extravagant. Simple. Peaceful.&nbsp; Mostly due to my children. Ashten is so strong, so beautiful. Her beauty is not just her skin, her eyes... it is her heart. She makes me so proud. You would think my daughter won the Nobel Prize... well not yet, not at 14.&nbsp; Was I responsible for that?&nbsp; I look at her and and I see bits and pieces of me.&nbsp; I couldn't even tell you what I did, or even how I did it.... I just know that I loved her. She saved me in so many ways. I wish she knew how large her role has been in my life. She deserves to know that. I wanted her to become her own person.&nbsp; I knew she would be. She is so strong.... I mentioned that already. What did I expect for her as a human being?&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing, I only wanted to teach her peace, fellowship.&nbsp; Maybe that's it.

And then there is my son. Brian is incredible. He inherently knew peace from the moment he was born. He is so much fun, so full of love.&nbsp; Brian is my baby.&nbsp; He attached himself to my hip from day one.&nbsp; He let go. I missed my baby. He has amazed me. So smart. Such a boy, really. He sees what life is about.&nbsp; No, he sees what he wants his life to be about..... and he keeps that in perspective somehow.&nbsp; He is only 10. Again, I found myself wanting to teach him the same...peace, fellowship.

Then came another human being into my life. One man who taught ME love, peace. I was perfectly content being alone. Well, I thought I was. Luckily, we started as friends.&nbsp; Honest... he is my best friend.&nbsp; Never have I been treated this well. To think that I almost turned my head and scoffed at the idea of being with him. He made me laugh so often and I mean really laugh.&nbsp; I remember getting to know him.&nbsp; He would come over with the rest of the crew after work. After some time, I found myself mostly talking and laughing with him. That's how it began, talking for hours with him. Time was standing still when he was around. I was attracted to him.&nbsp; Not usually my type, but I couldn't&nbsp; stop thinking about him. Now it's a year and a half later, and he is the love of my life. I can't wait until my day is over... I can't wait to talk to him.&nbsp; He is there with me when I go to bed, and right as I wake up. He touches me in ways that no one person has been able to before. He has taught me so much.&nbsp; He continues to every single day.&nbsp; He makes me proud.&nbsp; He makes me think. He is my heart. He has truly taught me what love is... Maybe that's it. 

Maybe that's it.&nbsp; No one person lives and learns from their parents alone. I have learned such hard but wonderful lessons from my parents.&nbsp; One thing is certain.&nbsp; I have finally learned love.&nbsp; Yesterday I had one of the first conversations with my mother since December of 2003.&nbsp; Although the reasons for our strained relationship are still not resolved and probably won't be for a long time, I was able to talk to them.&nbsp; There were no angry words exchanged. No blame. No pain...... just a daughter and her parents talking bout what is going on in their lives.&nbsp; I can tell you that a year ago there is no way that that conversation would have ever happened.&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; 

I wish I could express to my kids and my love how much they have taught me and enriched my life.&nbsp; My kids saved me.&nbsp; He showed me real, infallible love. 

&nbsp;How do you express your appreciation?"

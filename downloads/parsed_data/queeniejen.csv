"event","alright. im going to be REAL mature like others and dedicate my entry to some people.
TO ALL THE HATERS THE FAKERS & THE WANNA-BES:

first of all- GET OVER YOURSELF. you need to grow up, and start worrying about your own problems instead of pointing out all of mine. no one said i was perfect, and i sure as hell dont even wanna try to be. to the ones that are upset that i dont ever hangout with you anymore- did you ever once think that maybe there was a reason for that? maybe i dont wanna hangout with you anymore. maybe i dont think i wanna even be around you, or your negative attitudes. im not going to show ANYONE sympathy for anything. we're all freaking grown-ass adults (almost) and we need to start acting like it. sure ill miss you when you move away jonathan, but im not gonna boo-hoo and act all depressed and call you every 10 minutes of my life to see if you wanna do something. ive always said THE PHONE WORKS BOTH WAYS. and if you arent ganna make the effort to dial my number and just ask me, then you sure as hell shouldnt expect me to. 
i dont appreciate you writing immature LJ entries about me, trying to bash me and make me look like a bad person- WITHOUT EVEN SAYING MY NAME. that just shows how immature you are. i dont get my feelings hurt easily, so if you ever wanna do that again- just go ahead and say my name. it'll be easier for everyone.
im sure you're pretty pissed off, but i honestly dont care. i know that what im saying is 100 percent right, and i really dont care if you agree with me or not. i know who all of my REAL friends are, and i know they have my back all the way.

TO ALL THE FAKERS ON MYSPACE AND LIVEJOURNAL STEALING MY PICTURES AND USING THEM AS THERES:

all you're telling these people is that you are insecure, ignorant, and last but not least: freakin IMMATURE. im not trying to act better than anyone else, but my GOD stop acting so immature all of the time.

BOTTOM LINE:
Embrace what you are and not just what you are- but who you are. Love your imperfections, they make you beautiful. Be beautiful from the inside out, its not all about physical appearance! And its more than what meets the eye. Stop hiding behind a photograph of your ideal self, and start becoming who you want to be. People will love you for who you are, if you're real. Being fake accomplishes nothing because you will always be the 2nd rate version, the immitation, never the duplication or the equal. Stop living a lie, it will only destroy your sense of self further. You only have one life to live so make the best of it...you wouldnt want to look back and realize you wasted your time trying to be someone else.
THANK YOU"

on our way out of the mall- we went by starbucks and got a pumpkin pie spice frappuccino, but i forgot to ask for decaf, so needless to say- i was up all night.

and that sucked, because i had to be at the dentist this morning to get my teeth cleaned.

my dad kept asking me where his REAL daughter was, because i got up at 7 and cooked breakfast for everybody, and started cleaning the house. haha

but now- i feel HORRIBLE. i have to go to the doctor friday, because i think i have strep throat, and a stomach virus, AND i have had a migraine all day long.

daddy took me shopping today to try and make me feel better, and i got a new pink northface jacket :)

my grandaddy is in town from arkansas and hes staying with us until saturday!
i hope i feel better by tomorrow. i really look forward to eating LOTS of good food on thanksgiving- but ive hardly  been able to keep anything down today :/

<P>this week has gone by WAY too fast!</P>
<P>monday- stayed home, and did schoolwork for the day. monday night- went to church with my mom to see friends from LCB. and then scott picked me up and we went and met up with derek and melina. then taylor calls, and we meet all them at the bonfire thing.<BR>chase was cracking me up. he almost started&nbsp;a forest fire with a flaming pumpkin. after we got out of the woods- me, scott, taylor, tate, and chase drove around and they did stupid stuff like: drive through taco bell drive-thru backwards, and steal HUGE pumpkins from the ghetto. <BR>and watch chase run around like an idiot in his whoopie-cusion costume.</P>
<P>tuesday- went to HTMS for my first day, and taught. i was pretty exhausted when i got home. went to bed around 6 that night.</P>
<P>wednesday- went back to the school to teach, and by the time scott picked me up around 3:15- i was so tired, i fell asleep in his car. then we went to marks house, and i slept on the couch while they watched the longest yard. woke up around 6, and went to church. the sermon was REALLY good. its weird when you dont wanna go to church- and you go anyway, and you end up being REALLY happy that you did, because it was something you needed to hear :) <BR>after church me and my mom went to smoothie joes, and when i got home.. the rest of the night was awful. but we wont go into details.</P>
<P>this morning i was sposed to wake up, and go to school- but i didnt feel good, so i didnt go.<BR>i slept ALOT, and was lazy all day long. it felt good to relax. my feet hurt REALLY bad from standing up 7 hours everyday.</P>
<P>tomorrow i go back to HTMS to teach, scotts picking me up, and we're going to his house so i can help him study for some tests he has next week. and hopefully if we get done studying in time, we'll go see SAW 2.</P>
<P>and then saturday is MISS PV, and i promised id go. and chances are im going to make scott go with me. haha.</P>
<P>sunday is church, and HOLLIES WEDDING! ive been counting down the days </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are my sunshine. my only sunshine. you make me happy when skies are gray..</P>"

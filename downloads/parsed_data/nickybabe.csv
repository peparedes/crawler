WELL FUCKK ALL YOU's!  you best get your act together cause i want my damn texting back at least being able to send text messages.!.

Laura: Hey i missed you this weekend.  We so have to hang B4 Friday cause i have a game that nite and din with my dad.  its his birthday! Okay this is my schedule> nothing all day Wed. then prac. that nite about 5:30.  Thursday same nothing all day and then prac. in the evening, but i don't know the time yet!

Lu:  I hope you can do something with us this week.  I miss you babe!

Krystal: No hard feelings because i don't know the whole story, but from talking with ppl and reading your pro. it sounds like you really got your heart broke.  okay babe i hope you read this and don't get mad, but someone has to say it!  DUDe you can get better than RUsso.  I mean yea he is a nice guy, but you want someone who will flaunt you around.  someone who is proud to say ""hey this is my girlfriend.""  Someone who will kiss you anywhere at anytime.  Someone who will make you feel like your on top of the world.  ANd, babe KEvin wasn't it.  Krystal i think you and him not being together was for the best.  You need someone who will be there all the time.  Someone to hold you when your up to your knees in used kleenex, after crying over a horrible day.  Hunny you deserve the best, and i hope this year you can find the BEST!  All of that said above is not to hurt you, but was said cause i love you!  i know we haven't had the best times over the past few years, but i grew up with you and i'm always here for you if you need to talk.  In life nothing is easy, but with determination you can get through the rough spots.  love you babe...

"event","Yesterday i had a physical, and it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be.  The doctor told me im average, but when i looked at the chart my weight with my height was above average(meaning im fat).  Then afta i had to wait like 3 hours or something at my mom's work, but i kept busy playing games, and lookn through magazines.  i also visited the bookstore(lol!).  Yea and about 5:30pm she took me to Harvest Park to prac.  And, to say even though we didn't use the soccer ballz that much prac. wasn't all that bad.  Put it this way we ran our booties off! lol...

Then i came home and talked with J.  I feel bad cause i complain too much.  I wish i didn't do that or cry.  its jus so hard, but in a way it isn't.  i don't know i just can't splain it.  like i miss him sooo much, but it isn't as bad as when he was in Germany.  But what is different when he was in Germany i didn't cry, and now i cry more than i have in my life.  its so embarrassing cause i don't want him to think i am this big baby.  Sometimes i can't even control myself.  I just want to say SORRy> like shout it< cause he doesn't deserve someone calling him all the time complaining and crying.  i haven't been the best person/girlfriend this past 3 weeks to talk to on the phone.  it makes me feel awful.  sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry...
^ even though he isn't gonna read this it makes me feel betta to put what im thinkn in words comprehendable...

Okay yea and then we come to today, which has been an Ok day!...  Well i woke up at 10:30 and had breakfast, and then my sis came home... YUCk!  we fought over the remote and such, and then i started doing my chores and she left to do errands.  Now im half way done with my chores, and after i call shower, then food, and next prac.  doesn't this thursday sound so DANG eventful!..

I didn't even have time to wash my face and throw my hair up so i looked decent. NO!  so i answer the door with run mascara under my eyes and hair to the side.  My mom walks in and says WOW! nic weren't you tired (being a rhetorical question).  I just walked away.  SO yea i cleaned up and quickly did my chores.  Lata i fought with my sista for the remote and started to watch ALONG CAME POLLY, but didn't finish it.  What i saw of it was pretty funny.  Ne wayz yea the reason i didn't get to finish the movie was cause J called me up and then was texting me.  Yea so i had to go to the comp.  because my text on my phone is F-ed up!  YEa and so the conversation wasn't good cause i was in a bitchy mood, but in the end i told him i was in a Bitchy mood and i apologized and it was all good...  i love my j!  So ne wayz and then i quickly got dressed for soccer.  B4 soccer my mom and i went to my aunt and uncle's house to celebrate all the July birthdays.  SO i got to see all my cousins which i don't see very often one last time.  Then my mom dropped me off at the scrimmage, which we won!  We should've won ne wayz..  Plus i think i got a few assists, and just to say i hate UPPER BERNAL fields because they suck BUTT!  Yea and after that my mom went and bought some ice cream and then we came home.  I called my boi, and left a message.  Then i started cleaning my closet and getting rid all the clothes i didn't want.  I just finished my closet, dresser, and bed drawers this morning, but i still have to clean out my desk.  Well ne wayz so J called me back and we talk.  We don't really talk about much, but i just like to listen to his voice>sounds cheesy i know but i do!. After we talked i laid down and had a wonderful dream.  What was even better is i woke up to his voice.  Well in a way cause he called me this morning.

Well ne wayz now the after party>reception.  Now okay my 18-19 year old cousins were drinking cause it was an open bar, and one of them had at least 6 or more.  WOw!

Then about 7 or so that nite after dessert sometime i went with my mom and sis to babysit the lil rugrats.  I love my second cousins cause they seem just like first cousins and really thas how they are treated like to me first cousins.  Well ne wayz Courtney is i think 4 or 5 monthes, Ellis is adorable and just turned 1, and you got Kyle 5, Kaitln whose also 5, and then Matthew whose 3.  The Three older ones watched movies the whole time, but had to leave early cause they were sleeping ova at gong gong's (grandma's) Then we hung out with L and COurtney the rest of the nite.

Then nite prac. was actually for once hella fun!  i was laughing my ass off and i didn't have to go to the line to run because of it.  Plus in the beginning my group did hella good, so when we were having fun playing these little line games ppl who weren't in my previous group were being BITCHES.!.  Who cares i took care of that.  And, i wanted to go to the nite meeting we were going to have last nite, but i couldn't cause my mom decided we had to go to my aunt's house to help with the wedding stuff.  I in the end didn't really care.

Last nite i had a really serious conversation with Jeff, and now all i want is to see him.  I am literally counting it down!  i hate when the days get so dang close cause then that is all i want-wanting to see him!...

In between prac.'s yesterday i went to Kay's house.  She has a hella cool/nice house.  I liked it!  I had a lot a lot of fun hanging out with her.  She is awesome.  Her dad bought JAmba, MOm panda, and then her mom cut up fruit and made smoothies for us!  i thought i was in heaven. not 2 mention her Tv room is of the hook.THANX KAY FOR LETTING ME COME OVA!!

Okay and then my mom took the stray cat we took in to the vet, and i was right its a girl.  She is as old as our 2 cats, but she is just really small.  Then what is mind boogling is she has no fleas, good health, and is PREGNANT!  wow!  she is pregnant with four kitties that we could see in the ultra sound.  I am excited she is gonna be a mommy!...

Then last nite i was talking with Jeff, and sometimes i wonder if he see's me in his future you know?  Like i want to ask him, but i hate how i always ask him these dumb questions.  I know he some-what trust me, and i will take that over not trusting me at all.  Plus i know he cares for me, but im the type who just needs to be told over and over.  I just have to know that he is still here, and still feels the same.  I need to stop being so DANG serious!  i need to not worry about ne of this cause i know everything is good, and will last.

"event","Early Friday morning my sister, mom , and i drive down to San Diego for the weekend.  We stop about 7 to eat, and you could see MAGIC MOUNTAIN from where we ate, but no we had to keep going.  Then we get lost and end up at the border about to go to MEXICO...  That is why my mom never drives cause she always gets lost.  Then we final arrive at our destination SEA WORLD!  We spend the rest of the day there.  ANd, man o man was it a hot one.  That nite we head to our hotel and grab a bite to eat...

Saturday we wake up and head to an early lunch, which is Mexican food with my sister's soccer buddy.  The Mexican food was okay, but not as good as Casa Orzoco.  So yea then we visit Old Town, which is like historical and vintage shops.  Something older people can enjoy.  Then we head over to the beach, which was gorgeous.  We walk the beach for awhile, and then have to hurry back to the car because we had to drop my sisters friend off.  After we drop her off we go to visit my cousins in ESCONDIDO, which was cool...  Then we have a late din din, and hit the sac.

The next morning we scramble to check out and head back to Escondido area to see my cousin and her baby.  Elise is soo adorable, and big.  I love her baby.  After an hour visit we hit the road for home.

Now it takes almost forever to get home, and we arrive about 8 or so at nite to the house.  WOW!  was i tired...  So we get home and this cat we think is a stray is waiting for us.  My mom then decides to take him in.  So we clean him (fleas!)and then introduce him to Eva and Tony.  They are still getting to know each other i mean there is still hissing and grrrs, but overall it is getting a whole lot better.  O yea and his name is GREY!

Now it is MOnday morning, and i just finished some grueling conditioning.  And, i am back for more soccer this evening.  We got a hard soccer schedule this week i hope i can survive...  PRAY.

But i am ultra excited i get my hair did this week!! woot woot woot woot woot...

How is it that when I start actually hanging out with ppl and not being so sad or depressed she starts to get made at me.  What makes it worse is she is yelling about me to my older sister(who is absolutely perfect).  Sometimes I think it would be so much better if i could live with my dad because he is the only one who understands me.  I hate when my sista comes back because it is a known fact somehow i will get grounded.  She messes up my life when she comes back, and all she does is sleep and eat our food.  I hate it!  Ne one who reads this mite think its hella messed i say this, but if you saw how my sista treated me when we were younger and how she treats me know you would understand.  Both her and my mom treat me like I am below them.  I am glad i am leaving for a week so i can get the hell away from them.

"event","Well today I was suppose to call and talk to Jef, but no!  He wasn't there, and the whole time I couldn't understand ne one who answered the phone (cause you know he is in Germany).  So after I called a few times I gave up on trying to, and trying to understand ne thing they said.  So tomorrow is another day. lol!  He was probably off doing something.

Then most of the day I packed and did some chores.  O yea i also ate and watched Tv.  Then I was on the comp alot today> i don't know why?  hmm..

Then tonite (soon) I have soccer with my club team, and this is the first prac. since STATe... Which means conditioning today. SHYT!  I don't want to, but I have to.. Owell!!!  so I am off to P-town soon.

"event","So friday I had Laura go with me to get something, and we walked from my house to the store which is hella far.  SO we were drenched when we got back to my house.  Then that nite I went to din din with my dad.  And, I was so stressed and tired that I didn't really talk so it wasn't one of our best din nites out.  Then when I got back I cried to my mom (literally) that i was soo tired and stressed.  She comforted me and gave me meds. for my headache.  And, beleive it or not my stress was gone.  Thanx to my mom and Laura.  So i was feeln betta Saturday morning.

Also i decided that if someone kissed me then I pushed them off I wouldn't want Jeff to be mad at me>>> so i decided to forgive and not be mad, but I won't ever forget.  I hope after something like this it will make our relationship stronger if we both can get past this.

Now the worst, but kind of more embarassing thing imaginable happened to me.  So my period was late cause I was stressed, but I wasn't ready for it to come on Saturday.  I was freak'N cause during the first session(state soccer practice) I knew I had started and I couldn't go to the bathroom becuase I knew that my coach wouldn't let me and I wasn't gonna tell him why.  SO I waited, but I shouldn't cause I was wear'N white shorts.  All I could say and think was shyt;Fuck!  Then I ran to the bathroom and it was all bad.  My mom and I tried to drive back to livermore b4 the next session, but there was hella traffic and a 15-30 min drive turned into a 45-75 min one. SO we couldn't go home.  And I had to play in the next session with soiled undies and shorts.  And, by the end of the session I think everyone knew I had started.  How embarrasing!  O well I am not ashamed, but feel dumb for not coming prepared.  O yea i know that was kind of gross to tell, and i hope none of you were disgusted. lol!

I am so scurred today I find out if I am going with the State Team or United to Regional camp.  It is soo important, but I won't be upset if I make the United Team again.  Then I wouldn't have suceed my goal, but that is okay.  But i don't want to make the Regional pool because I don't think I would get through it with out crying the whole time.  I would miss my family, be so tired, and then Jef I wouldn't see him for almost 5 weeks.  Since he leaves on the 11th (maybe) when he gets back on the 10th.  But, its in GOD's hands.

And, yea Mr. God can you make sure I don't crash cause we are flying on the 4th of July!  What are those State office ppl think'N!!!geezz...

well lata's

"event","Well yesterday was the worse day imaginable.  So many bad things happen i got a migraine and cried it seemed all afternoon.  Things with Jef, and then it helped when I got to talk to L.  She's really been there to talk to, and even though i am feeling alone at the time she's really comfort me. (THANX!)

WOrse with my migraine I couldn't sleep, and after I took a different type of Medicine I did fall asleep, but for about 3 hours.  Then at 2ish I woke up and watched Tv.  About 2:30 or 3 I went on the comp and E-mailed Jef, and then went back to TV.  About 4 I took sleep med.s so I could sleep, and it worked.  But i am still really ultra tired.  I think I could use a nap rite now, and food.

Today I am suppose to have din din with my dad.  And, I hope I won't be tired for that nor for State prac. tomorrow.  I need a hella good nite sleep tonite.

My stress level I think is decreasing, at least I hope it is.  I can't stand not sleeping and being tired all day.  Plus it doesn't help when other ppl are stressing you out.

p.s.
Q: should you give ppl second chances?

A:yea because if you believe they can change or won't do it again then just maybe they won't.  Its all about trust.!

you got to hurt 
in order to know,

you got to fall
in order to grow,

you got to lose
in order to gain,

So I talk to him and then call him from my house phone.  We talked, and then I yawned and by 2 or something we said good bye. For some reason I started to I don't know get a lil sad.(teary eye)  Cause this week I've gotten to talk to him so much and then next week i probably won't talk to him at all.

Then I talked to Jef, and it was all good.  It was tough to talk to him, and then something happen and I think I made him mad or something I am not sure, but I have to wait till tomorrow to talk to him.  I hope it isn't ne thing.  I hate how i worry so Damn much.  I hope he reads this and knows I wouldn't ever hurt him.  So, hopefully I can get a good nite rest.  Cause when I worry like this i can't sleep, and I am just gonna hope it isn't ne thing.

Then I also dyed my hair, and it seems kind of DRAMATIC!.  I hope it isn't as dramatic as it looks like, but O well it will blend in a week or 2. I can pull it off. LOl!

there is no way to win

Either way we'll have to be apart
And knowing this I don't know where to start

You weren't suppose to become my world
being with you my thoughts become swirled

After school was over so were you and me

instead you stole me away
and i don't know how to say

but now your my everything
I'm your Queen and your my King.

standing by you through it all is what i can do
Till this moment I didn't know how much I really Loved you.

All you say and all you do
i only ask of you

promise me never say never
And you'll be with me forever and ever

I'll just smile and call you a big fat JERK

"event","Okay today all i did was chores cause tomorrow i am gonna hang with L.  Then I had a tough time trying to call Jef, and he called me and then we talked for 10 sec. Then I tried and tired to call him, but nothing worked.  SO I called the operator, looked online, and called jef's mom.  Few hours lata Sharon called me, and then I got the correct numbers to dial and call.  SO yea.  Then she tells me some stuff to tell him, and one the things is good/bad (to me).  Well Jef got into UCLA i guess and then he has to choose now between Baylor and UCLA.  Well UCLA is cheaper, closer, and better in my case.  Then Baylor is like his dream school, its best in track, but in texas.  Now I am all for both, but more for UCLA.  YEt, the thing about UCLA is when he gets back he has to leave the day after for a camp down in L.A.  Well there is a chance then I might not see him because I am going to Regional Camp and if I get held over I won't, but if I don't I will only get maybe a day with him.  SUCKS!  But then in the long run he can drive up for long weekends, and breaks...  I am soo for that, but then ifhe goes to Baylor I can see him for a while B4 he leaves for school.  Now the con is he can't back often.  This is a tough decision I think, but if Baylor is his DREAm school he should go there, but if it doesn't matter and the expenses do UCLA.  But I have a feeling it will be Baylor because it sounds like that is his DREAM school, but I don't know.  Well no matter what I back his decision.  Well got to get back to the chores.soo I can hang with CHang tomorrow. MOvIes!

love much

The little angel is due in five weeks.  Alex is nervous, but I know he will be a perfect father.  I just have to convince him of that before the baby comes."

Sirpa is in her 20th week now.  We're halfway there.  We'll get everything ready this summer.  Probably in Colorado.  Would be a little easier.  We'll go to Colorado after playoffs and start to get things finished.

I am at 25 goals now.

Goal 23 was point 999
Goal 24 (same game) was point 1,000.  
We beat L.A. in OT.

Goal 25 tonight was not enough.  We lost, but we still played well.  We didn't give up.  

Alex was there for my 1,000 points.  We had a very nice celebration.  He's trying to catch me with goals.  I guess I'll have to keep scoring or he'll win.  ;)

<i>Alex Tanguay and Marek Svatos scored shootout goals to help the Colorado Avalanche maintain their dominance over the Columbus Blue Jackets with a 3-2 victory on Saturday.

Tanguay and Svatos also accounted for both Colorado goals in regulation as the Avalanche won their fourth straight.

Colorado finally broke through when Tanguay flipped a rebound past Leclaire with Jody Shelley off for slashing. It was Tanguay's 17th goal of the year.</i>

I miss my shootout chance in Dallas, and Alex makes his in Colorado.  Congratulations, armas.  Both goals were beautiful, I'm proud of you.  You're catching up to me on goals too."

Kidding, of course.  Except for joyriding.  I know he is.  But is fine.  I offered the home to Martin to stay in while he is in Anaheim.  He needs a place of his own instead of hotels or staying with teammates constantly.  I am happy to let my house go to good use and I know he will take good care of it.  If he wants to wash my cars while he's there... well, the car washing things are in the large cabinet behind the Z3.  

For other news... Alex and I are just spending time in Finland, having time alone until the boys are out of school.  That is soon though, and then Sirpa will bring them over and they will start their summer with us.  I love Alex so much for being so caring with my boys.  Not everyone would take on extra baggage of a wife and three children, but they adore Alex because Alex is... Alex is just Alex.  And how can you not adore Alex?  

We will not mention what comes up in September that I was chosen for but Alex was not.  Nor will we mention how someone is only the 'Mediocre One' (I learned new word) and not very great at all of his decision making.

<i>Colorado was in desperate need of a victory after its longest winless streak in two years dropped the Avalanche just a point ahead of Vancouver in the Northwest Division.
Selanne gave it to them, one-timing Paul Kariya's crossing pass through the crease for his first point since scoring his 15th goal Feb. 14 against Detroit. Selanne had a huge grin and was mobbed by teammates after securing Colorado's third win in 14 home games</i>

And I did it when team needed me too!  Was not thinking about anything at time except scoring, but now that game is over, I say that this goal was for two very important people.
Steve Moore, because we are all so very thankful that you will be ok and it was so great to have you at game.
Teppo Numminen, because on same day, doctors declared his heart disease was not so terrible he could not play anymore.  But now he is able to play and will be fine for five to ten years before they will do surgery to fix it."

Paul has not told me if he has plans for us, so I wonder on that.  But I also promise Marty we will do something too.  Decisions, decisions.  *kisses* to you know who and you know who.  If you do not know who, no kiss for you.  *pauses*  I think I have too much coffee this morning."

I only hope that things are still going to be ok.  Am not sure about game tomorrow.  I want to play, but we will have to see if I can."

Jets become Coyotes.  Ducks change.  Sharks change.  Now I change to be Av and Paul and I not find our old rhythm yet.  I miss it.  We are out of.. sink? No, um... sync.  Yes. 

Blake has very nice hard shot.  Is my fault for being in way, I think.  Don't know, but I am fine, just sore.  I forgot to say yesterday, but Happy Birthday to Danny.  Sorry you and Footer missed game.  Headaches are annoying things.  

Paul says he did not hear boos last night, but I know he did.  Boos hurt.  You spend so many years with one team and fans and then you leave, for some reason or other, and fans don't, what is word?  appreciate that you gave them so much of your life.  Is worse when you are traded away and lose all friends and then come back to play against old team and fans still boo you too.  Stupid fans."

They booed last time.  Sharks boo me.  I think Californians like booing.  Is not fair to Paul.  We only leave California to play together and have shot at Cup.  At least, I leave California to play with Paul.  I will tell Paul to ignore Boos.  Fans just sore they not have him anymore."

It was very relaxing. :) And now we must leave for Arena and game, if Paul will stop messing with hair. He just wants to make sure he looks good for camera when he scores birthday hat trick. ;) Mina rakastan sinua, Paul."

"event","That is really only opinion I have right now of Colorado. It is cold. Although I am told by teammates that it is not so cold, so maybe it is just shock from leaving Anaheim, which is very, very hot. At any rate, it cannot possibly get colder than Finland, so it will be okay.

It is very strange to be practicing with new team. I have done it many times, but it is not something to get used to. Paul makes it much easier, though. Even though we have not played on ice together in a long time it is just like I remember. It is nice to know that some things have not changed."

Spending time in Anaheim makes me miss it so much more. There are many good memories. I wish sometimes we both could stay there. But it did not work this way. Opportunity was in Colorado, not here. Still, I will miss, and I know Paul will miss. And I know many will miss Paul."

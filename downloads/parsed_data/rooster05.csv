&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said, glancing around, &ldquo;You like birds?&rdquo;
I was taken aback; we had never actually spoken before this moment.
&ldquo;Uh, yeah. They&rsquo;re good, I guess.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I like &lsquo;em, too. My favorite is the Peregrine. You know that one? It&rsquo;s this badass falcon. A whole lot of &lsquo;em died in the fifties or something. Now they&rsquo;re coming back.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know them. A pair used to live on my building. One of them died and the other flew off. They&rsquo;re fast flyers, right?&rdquo;
Perhaps too absolutely, he responded, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the fastest fucking bird there is.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo;
The overhead PA garbled something unintelligible.
&ldquo;Yeah. Check out my tat,&rdquo; he said.
Ted untucked his shirttail delicately and raised it to his chin with both hands, glancing once again from side to side. I was not wholly sure if this were appropriate behavior for a cashier on the job. The artwork, however, was truly stunning. Aside from the fact that it was not finished (it was very fresh), there, in a bold outline across his stomach, flew the majestic avian&mdash; the definitive, if impartial, Peregrine.
&ldquo;Oh, wow,&rdquo; I managed to say.
Ted nodded eagerly.
Then, as if summoned, a small, brooding man appeared behind the register with a clipboard in hand. His name-tag read <strong>Tom</strong> in large, plain letters. He was obviously Ted&rsquo;s manager. I pictured a blue Igloo lunchbox in the break room, wherever that was. He leaned over and whispered something to Ted which I couldn&rsquo;t hear.
&ldquo;The Peregrine, of course,&rdquo; Ted replied.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right,&rdquo; Tom agreed.
Ted&rsquo;s gaze became slightly perplexed and far-off. He peered at me (through me) for a long moment before removing his shirt and exiting the store.
&ldquo;Uh, hey, where&rsquo;s he going? You didn&rsquo;t just you fire him, did you?&rdquo; I asked Tom.
Tom did not answer me. His face, too, was now bereft of any former quality.
&ldquo;Hey, snap out of it! What just happened?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is our time, it is not their time,&rdquo; Tom murmured.
&ldquo;What the hell are you talking about?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sir, what do you stand for?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; I was shocked.
&ldquo;I said, what do you stand for?&rdquo;
To this preposterous question I could not think of an answer. No one had ever asked me that before. Once, I thought, I stood for high art, and literature. As for now, having been pressed by a stranger in a strange situation, I simply felt confused and highly self-aware. I rounded up my groceries and quickly left the store. I got the hell away from Tom.

A few weeks passed by. I bought my groceries elsewhere and nearly forgot about Ted, Tom, and the Peregrine.
One afternoon, I found Ted constructing what looked like a nest on the sixth floor balcony of the tenement across the street. His tattoo, from a distance, appeared to be complete. I called up to him, curious as to what the hell he was up to&mdash; what exactly he believed he was doing up there. He squawked at me.<p>&hellip;what do I stand for?<span style=""display: none;""> </span><span style=""display: none;""> </span></p></xml:namespace></xml:namespace></xml:namespace></xml:namespace>"

"event","<xml:namespace ns=""livejournal"" prefix=""lj""><p style=""text-align: left;"">&ldquo;Between you and me,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;the man was a louse. Had it been up to him, we would see a turkey on the flag.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How about, &lsquo;Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise?&rsquo;&rdquo; the waitress, Lucy, inquired.
&ldquo;A silly rhyme you tell to children. And do not get me started on his banking system,&rdquo; I glowered.
&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t like him, huh?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is not that I care for him or not care for him. I do not believe in his principles.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I read this one the other day: &lsquo;At twenty years the will reigns, at thirty the wit, at forty the judgment.&rsquo; That one&rsquo;s worthwhile, right?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I believe I am going to give up on you, Lucy, if you are not careful,&rdquo; I smiled.
&ldquo;Daylight savings?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pencil shavings. Will you bring my coffee, please?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, coming up, hun.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cream, no sugar, please.&rdquo;
And she left. It was a good thing, too. She was a sweet girl, Lucy, though discussion of B. Franklin&rsquo;s nonsense was an abhorrent waste of time. For my respect, a man must abandon the trappings of organized society and embrace his inner instincts, not quell them with endless quotes. The Founders were regulatory ninnies.
&quot;Bah,&quot; I exhaled.
I turned my attention outward, scratched my bald head. A newspaper hit the window, then stole away into the void. I closed my eyes and began to <i>om</i>. The diner&nbsp;softly&nbsp;dissapated and gave way to visions, or omens.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that he discovered electricity, remember? With that kite. And the key?&rdquo; Lucy persisted, coughing first to get my attention.
&ldquo;I do not care if he invented the paper I wipe my ass with. Pardon me. Do not bring him up again, please.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Alright, alright. Here you go, hun.&rdquo;
The coffee steamed cautiously.
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said cautiously.
After a moment I recollected myself, and returned to my mantra.
In the clearing of my mind a murder of crows heckled a tiny calico cat. The cat, rearing up on his haunches, hissed furiously, as he was vastly outnumbered. This stance proved he would know no fear, and, briefly, he became a fearsome tiger. His swipe at the largest, and therefore deadliest, crow, disgraced the attackers. They cocked their heads to the side and sat.
Shift then to a man wearing a red clown nose, dancing down the sidewalk. He had been beaten and bruised. He had no money. Luck would have him dead, or worse. His mouth was agape in horror, while his eyes were wide with delight. No one noticed, or cared, least of all himself.&nbsp; He halted and looked directly at me. He did not blink.
Lucy&#39;s coughing once again pulled me from my meditation.
&ldquo;So what brings you in, hun? You&rsquo;ve been sitting for hours. Everything alright? You&rsquo;re dressed really funny.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I apologize. These are my robes, and I am waiting for a friend, Lucy. We are supposed to meet here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Robes? What are you into now?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lucy, I am not &ldquo;into&rdquo; anything now. I have found my true self and enlightenment through the spiritual teachings of the Buddha. Actualization may be a difficult concept to grasp for those looking outside-in.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh. Well pardon me, Mr. Enlightenment. It is nice to see you happy, or at peace, at least.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you. It is a never ending struggle, you know,&rdquo; I resigned with a sigh, and a smile.
&ldquo;Oh, I know, hun. Believe me!&rdquo;
We had a laugh. One day she could find it, too: the calm, and the tempest, and the calm.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re you waiting for? Ted Lowell?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Alfonso?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not today.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fred, that traveling salesman guy, Fred?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do not believe you have met him before, Lucy. He is the Dalai Lama.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Dalai Lama&hellip;?!&rdquo;
&ldquo;He looks like the Dalai Lama,&rdquo; I said.

I hadn&#39;t slept a wink for three days, first of all. My subpoena was left on the bus, abandoned. I could hardly recall the assailant&#39;s profile. My suit wasn&#39;t pressed, and my tie was a shambles. There were grass stains on my shirt. I hadn&#39;t showered, and my toes stuck together. I wasn&#39;t wearing any socks. My hairstyle was beyond reprieve. My eyeballs were barren and itchy. And then, I was practically crying. I detected a parakeet in my stomach, flapping it&#39;s wings.
&quot;They&#39;re ready for you now,&quot; the bailiff said.
I made my way in.
Then, something tugged on my jacket sleeve. It was a little man with a pug nose. He wanted to borrow my telephone. In his right hand he held a brown paper bag scarcely concealing a bottle of Listerine. He lifted it, glanced around before slugging a long pull, and farted. Deep inside me, my heart confided that together we shall inherit the Earth, not to mention it&#39;s miseries.
&quot;Here you go,&quot; I said, handing the midget a cell phone.
&quot;...&#39;preciate it,&quot; he said.
&quot;Just make it quick. I&#39;m needed.&quot; I said.</xml:namespace>

"event","A few Jehovah witness men came to my door. Abby was glib.
&quot;Let   me tell you something about the watchtower! It's deserted! No one on   high! Take your pamphlets and you can shove them!&quot; she hollered.
&quot;Thanks, guys. Not today,&quot; I said.
&quot;Blessed be those who give themselves-&quot;
I closed the door and went back to the 3D puzzle I was working on: the statues of Easter isle.
&quot;Those   guys seriously need to re-evaluate their lives. Seriously,&quot; Abby said   from the hall. She was dusting the trim, over and over.
&quot;Gotta make a living somehow,&quot; I said.
&quot;You make three dollars a day selling bean bags, tootsie pop.&quot;
&quot;All for you, coffee cake.&quot;
There was a knock at the door. This time it was our neighbor, wearing drab rubber river waders. Rain pat-patted on his cap.
&quot;Your dog is in my yard again,&quot; he said.
&quot;Hanz, we don't have a dog, remember?&quot; I said.
&quot;None of that tripe, boy. Get that damn pyrenees out of my yard or I'll throw it in the chipper.&quot;&nbsp;
I shut the door as he finished laughing. Once, he caught my boat on fire just to spite me. He was a terrible old fart.
&quot;Stay dry out there, Hanz,&quot; I said.
&quot;I miss Spike,&quot; Abby said. 
&quot;Me too, pistachio.&quot; 
Spike was our pyrenees puppy.
&quot;No you don't! All you do is drink all day! I can't take this anymore!&quot; she sobbed. 
Another knock at the door. It was the police.
&quot;Sir,   there have been complaints of strange bouts of depression emanating   from this residence. Permit me to look around?&quot; said Officer Krab.
I   swung the door wide and allowed them in. We had not entertained company   in years. One of the officers started squinting. Admittedly, the place  was a  little worse for the wear. The sofas were upside down. Mice ran   unabashedly.
&quot;This is Abby,&quot; I said.
Abby sat inside a ring of kleenex on the floor. Officer Krab took some notes. 
&quot;...never seen this before,&quot; he murmured.
I   lead them downstairs to the torture chamber. They examined the   stockade, the iron maiden, guillotine, my various whips, chains, and   flails. The female officer, Stubblefield, shined her badge to the man   in the rack. He was unconscious. 
&quot;I have a license for that,&quot; I said.
&quot;We'll have a look at that upstairs,&quot; Krab said.
 Back in the kitchen, Abby began peeling off the wallpaper with her fingernails.&nbsp;
&quot;I was penetrated by a filthy magistrate!&quot; she proclaimed."

"event","<div>Though we started our trek on virtually a whim, Larry and I had been clambering an unnamed trail deep in the vast wilderness for roughly two weeks now. To say&nbsp;the hike was a scenic one would be an understatement; on the first day, our path wound through misty waterfalls and across cliff faces;&nbsp;by day six, it was as if we were on a different continent altogether. The looming Douglas Firs had dispersed, the sword ferns had retreated, whle deep crevasses in the Earth&nbsp;gently healed themselves, inviting petite acai and gumwood trees to inhabit the low, golden hills of this: our new land. The occasional breeze was sweet and warm and lulling.
Ahead of me, Larry halted, his arm raised in a fist.</div><div>&quot;I think we should wait for some clouds to form to catch our bearings,&quot; he said.
&quot;That sounds good to me,&quot; I said.</div><div>I began to unpack. There was little left of my rations. Larry had been out since morning, though neither of us worried much. What we found here would be ours.
&quot;Do you know about the ancient civilization out here?&quot; he said.
I looked around, but there was nothing there.</div><div>&quot;Not particularly,&quot; I said.
&quot;Somewhere nearby is a cove where the sunlight never shines, or so I&#39;ve heard. There is some kind of village aside the cove. Huts are made from moss and river rocks, with cold water running through the foundations. The natives are said communicate with their hands, eyes, and feet.&quot;
&quot;What do you think they eat? For food?&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s tough to say. They fear agriculture,&quot;&nbsp; he said.
&quot;Of course,&quot; I said.
&quot;They fear the future.&quot;
For a brief moment I imagined some secret ruins in the foliage. My eyes squinted to see. A totem seemed to appear and vanish, though I couldn&#39;t be sure it was actual.
Later, a macaw landed on my shoulder. I fed it some granola, and it flew away. I wondered how old it was.
&quot;We could probably conquer them,&quot; Larry said.
&quot;Huh?&quot;
&quot;I said we should conquer them, the villagers.&quot;
&quot;What if they know we&#39;re coming? I&#39;d like to see my family again, Larry. You&#39;re scaring me a little.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;ll have no idea, these tribal dolts. I&#39;ll approach them from the south, you come around, later, from the east. We&#39;ll flank them in a pincer strike. There is nothing to worry about.&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t even know where to find this village, let alone whether or not it exists. It could be anywhere.&quot;
Slowly, Larry touched the ground, and delicately tasted his fingers. He pointed to our left. 
&quot;It&#39;s that way,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#39;t ask why, something just calls to me. Like a voice.&quot;</div><div>&quot;I don&#39;t like this, Larry.&quot;</div><div>&quot;I don&#39;t give a shit what you like.&quot;
A tiger snarled behind us. I was suddenly and inexplicably terrified, not only of Larry, but also my inability to stop him.
&quot;Suppose we come across a shaman or something? What if my teeth get turned into grapes? I don&#39;t want my teeth turned into grapes, Larry,&quot; I said.
&quot;Shut your fucking flap and wrap these vines around your body. And here, take this machete,&quot; he said.
I wasn&#39;t aware we brought a machete. Where had he...?
&quot;What if there is no village?&quot; I asked faintly.
&quot;Then, my friend, we hunt for the Madonna, Mother of hope, tears of blood,&quot; he said.
I nodded.
&quot;We attack at twilight,&quot; he said.
He disappeared into a cropping of black orchids. Across the sun flew a great egret of silver, blue and scarlet. I just kept standing there, looking around.

"event","Just fifteen minutes until closing time, and all I can comprehend are giant dirigibles and old fashioned flying machines. There I am, weightless, goggles on, performing loop-de-loops as my children watch from the ground below. Kids are amazed by anything! I land choppily and give my son the scarf my own father had untrusted me. It's when I wrap it around his neck that I realize just how big he has gotten. Our compatriot Wilbur zooms by on a velocipede. Leagues of sunny maritimers pursue him down the boardwalk. Life is good by the sea, in the air. Wilbur comes back to us and says, &quot;Here, you'll want this.&quot; He removes his head and tosses it to my daughter. Wilbur is, in fact, an automaton. Little Mavis squeels with gaiety at her new antiquated face. &quot;I'll oil you every day!&quot; she says. &quot;And brush your tin hair and we'll play jacks and marbles and share our secrets...though you mustn't tell anyone!&quot; Wilbur is delighted. He says, &quot;Let us embark for the city of tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;Excuse me, sir? Can you validate my parking?&quot; a woman says.
&quot;Why, of course. That is no problem. Do you worship God, or gods?&quot; I ask.
&quot;Neitzsche is a faggot. God is Alive,&quot; she says. There are bits of stained glass in her hair. 
I swoop a ticket into her hand, a pterodactyl returning to feed her baby dinosaurs.
&quot;Can you even begin to understand His majesty?&quot; she asks.
I call for the manager."

"event","Old Marvin was obviously blind. We all knew it. Everyday he would come into the bank to check his balance and take about five minutes just feeling around as though he had never seen anything before. He'd pass the plants, the fake ones in the lobby, and he'd always say, &quot;oh, heavens,&quot; as he batted their dust-covered plastic fronds. It was sort of funny, in its way, though we never called him out  because was so kindly, and he didn't wear glasses or carry a cane. Plus, he wasn't <em>that</em>  old. We didn't want to embarrass him. One afternoon he bumped into another man on his path to a teller. The man was cordial about it, even though Marvin dislodged his toupee which subsequently fell into a soapy water bucket that the janitor was using. Marvin just apologized and continued on, staring at nothing in particular. Jennica told me later that Marvin was pulling out a loan for a car.&nbsp;<br />&quot;Is he good for it? I mean, can we do it?&quot; I asked.<br />&quot;Yeah, it all checks with his credit.&quot;<br />&quot;Did you clear him?&quot;<br />&quot;Well, what was I supposed to do?&quot;<br />Neither of us spoke for the rest of the day, after that.

"event","As always, our little group convened again on Wednesday. Even in spite of last week's fiasco, there we were, sitting, laughing, interrogating like old chums, sipping our coffees (Julie with a sweet chai). Margo told us that she had picked up another book on star-gazing just the other day. She had already dog-eared several pages, we were assured.
""Can you show us where to find Ursa major?"" Alan asked.
""On a clear night, yes,"" Margo beamed.
""How about minor?"" Julie piped in, slyly.
""Sure. Though that one's a little tougher.""
""I can only imagine,"" I laughed, astonished.
Margo really knew her stuff when it came to the cosmos- assuming she was telling the truth.
Later, when the time was right, Alan thought it appropriate to discuss his wife with us. On Sunday Juliette would be five years dead.
""I remember when we used to ride up to Devil's Mountain in my old pick-up. You could see for miles. All the towns and hills. At night especially when all you could see were dots in the sky...on the land. I just miss her so much.""
It was difficult. We had all known her, and loved her. Her smiles, though rare, were bright as sunshine through cotton particles in Tennessee. She was tiny, stylish; an occasionally eccentric woman whose baking skills found ovation in even the most highfalutin critic. Her wasp(!) honey glazed croissants still captivated us all. My mouth watered bittersweet. Alan slunk over and became melancholy, a prisoner of her alive and thriving memory. We all took our turns hugging him and letting him know that it was going to be alright. I was last and told him that she was irreplaceable, a real ruby in the sand.
""We all miss her, buddy.""
He nodded, dodging our concerned faces. Margo and Julie's quiet conversation to each other grew louder, though I wasn't really listening and neither was Alan.
""...so many women who would be so lucky..."" was heard, however, and Alan grinned, red-in-the-face. I patted him on the back. 
Simultaneously, two candy bars fell right out of my pocket.
A silence fell behind them.
""Kit-Kats? Give me a break!"" Julie's voice trilled, finally. Alan chuckled.
Since I began dieting months ago I knew I had to forbid myself from most sugars: sucrose, lactose, glucose, high fructose corn syrup (at least whenever possible) in order to lose weight and feel good about myself again. In total, I had lost one hundred pounds. Everyone had been incredibly supportive of my decision in this, Julie most of all. Julie was a recovering alcoholic and knew well the importance of self-control.
""It's not what it looks like. I'm just holding them for a friend. Or something.""
""I think it's exactly what it looks like,"" Alan muttered, amused.
""Who, pray tell, are you 'holding' them for?"" Margo sighed.
I was going to catch flack for this, for appearing weak. These people were born for flack, though. I figured I'd just try to play coy and have some fun.
""Well, last night I...""
""Went on a binge? Fell off the wagon? How many more were there? I can't believe this. Christ's sake why are you so weak?"" Julie would be relentless. I feared her eyes, actually.
""No, last night I went out with a lady. I know, it must be hard to believe, but I had a date. We went to a movie and she must have slid these in my pocket. That's all.""
""Which theater? The Blue Moon? Downtown?"" Julie persisted.
I nodded, sort of shrugged.
""Nuh-uh. Nice try. They don't sell Kit-Kats at that theater. Also, I was there last night as well and I didn't see you.""
""Huh. Is that so?""
""C'mon, Jules. Guy deserves a little treat here and there,"" Alan said.
""You stay out of this one, Steinman!"" Julie barked playfully.
""Fine. You got me. And you were going to find out anyway, you know. I picked them up for myself and for all of us. No, really. I'm serious Julie! There are four to a pack and there are four of us. That is two apiece. I think that's fair. Today marks one hundred pounds lost.""
All eyebrows raised high in some emotion. Smiles spread more slowly.
""I was excited,"" I finished. ""Don't look at me like that.""
""I'm going to call the police!"" Julie exclaimed. Her manner in the group was cynical, often accusatory. In truth, her eyes would be the first to congratulate. She had always been there for me, even before the divorce. Her faith ran deep.
She also had a knack for elusiveness.  
""Well, I think that that's just wonderful. To remember how nice a reward can be. Yes. Well done! I'll take mine now, thank you,"" Margo tweeted, smokily.
""Yeah I'll have one of those. Keep it up, bud. You're doing great,"" Alan offered, smiling. I thanked him.
As Julie picked the chocolate bars from the ground and removed their wrappers, I wondered if she had any idea how much she meant to me. Would she, my Juliette, eating her unbroken Kit-Kat's, someday depart my dreams? Could these friends break apart? Our wistful sinfonia dissipated into overtones? We are the orchestral players.
""Don't you dare do this again, though,"" Julie leads with cello.
""I would never,"" my tympani concludes."

I&#39;m miserable.
There are these people all lined up at the bar, drinking. They&#39;ve got scotch tapes on their faces where shapes make out odd yellow flickering frenzy. Ale froth gone tepid stained on smiles.

"event","""I asked for Snapple Regular!"" raged the boss, hurling the bottle of Snapple Flavor that caught me hard right below my left ear. The pain shot through me and mixed devilishly with my failure. I started bawling. ""Get it right or I'll fire you!"" he continued, pounding his fists. From his fury I stumbled out onto the hallway floor, a crying mess. Thankfully, no one seemed to notice me collapse except for Anne, who I don't like. ""Why don't you just go take a nap, Manne,"" I sobbed. She glared at me but I flipped her off. What is with this company? I thought. I had a bad headache in the back of my skull. Maybe it was from everyone being so damn disappointed in me all the time. Anne kept glaring at me. I just couldn't handle it any longer. Something snapped in me and suddenly all I wanted to do was stand up for myself. After a quick inhale I shot back to the office to blow some steam into the boss' milk. ""Uh, Chief?"" I said, knocking on his door and trying my absolute hardest not to cry, ""I'm not sure what you think I'm supposed to do around here, but really, truly, I've been to every Snapple Store in this city, and they stopped making Snapple Regular five years ago. I just can't find it. Sir."" To avoid his gaze I tiptoed around the room, in search of something, anything. I settled on some pictures hanging against the far wall. They were difficult to see thoroughly with my vision being so watered, though it was easy enough to discern their subject. I had never known the boss to be a fan of anything, much less figure skating, but there he was clear as ice, pulling off the perfect triple axle. He looked fabulous in his white spandex uni and rhinestones, really. ""I originally hired you under the pretense that you would accomplish any task I should require of you. So what you are telling me here is that you have given up on the job I hired you specifically for,"" he said. I cleared my throat, ""Ahem, uh, well, sir, when you put it in that context, then yes, I suppose you could say that. But you must know that I have been searching and searching since before nine this morning, and when I ask all the clerks and the cashiers if they carry this drink they shake their heads and tell me not to ask about it anymore. 'Snapple Flavor, only,' they say, then they point to this poster that reads: uh, 'Here at Snapple we recognize thirst, and our first priority is to burst Flavor into every bottle. Snapple Flavor! Don't be Regular anymore!' and there is a picture of this guy on a boat with yellow tinted glasses holding a bottle of Flavor, and he's surrounded by, this kind of psychedelic swirly thing, which is cool, and pretty. Why don't you drink that, sir? It's delicious, really. I mean judging by your, uh, vibrant lifestyle, it seems like you would love it,"" I finished, hoping that he didn't take that last as sarcasm. It wasn't meant to be sarcasm. Carefully, I placed the bottle back in front of him, and ran to the space between the open door and the wall, still sniffling, but not that much.  For a moment I was certain he was going to explode. However, to my surprise, I could hear him breathing calmly, if loudly. I poked my head out and he was somehow standing gentile, staring at the photos on the wall as if remembering a friend long gone. Did he notice me staring at them? I wondered. He took one down and held it out towards me. I reached for it timidly. As he spoke I noticed something in his voice had changed, ""I had passion, once, you know? I breathed passion. I sweat passion,"" he rubbed his temples as I took the photo, ""I would slice through ice to roars of millions. Deafening, yes, but if you could only know the sheer enthusiasm. The fires of the masses, melting the ground beneath me, trembling. They would have me glide and I would have them weeping. Weeping from deep down, from that place where great beauty resides. And then, I was that beauty. What I am saying is, I have drank that drink, that Flavor. They were the regulars! The people, ha. That drink was my life! It encompassed me, filled me with warmth. But now look. Look at the price I have paid. That same beauty has sucked itself dry and been with replaced with schedules and meetings and taxes and wristwatches. The beauty is gone and all that is left is myself, a Regular. How can I fool myself any longer? I cannot. It is too late for me, son. You have shown me that."" He idled to the fainting sofa in the corner. He pulled a fuzzy blanket over his thin frame. The room became cold. I couldn't help but rush to his side, and he looked very weak. ""No! No it's not gone, don't you blame me for this!"" I cried, ""All you need to do is drink! There's still beauty in there, I can see it, sir!"" He didn't seem to hear me. His eyes were pale, a vacant slate tumbling downward. His breath came short, ""You are relieved of your task, boy. I know now, you tried for this old man, moreso than anyone I have ever met. I am sorry for being so coarse with you. Remember me. Tell Snapple to bring Regular back. For us old guys,"" as he perished. A warm blue light filled my heart, though only lasted for a brief moment. I stopped crying. For the first time in days I found a quiet peace. He was a kind man, after all. I would miss him greatly. Really. In his memory, I shattered the Flavor bottle after several stomps. Then, I shuffled to his intercom, ""Anne, Anne? We need to get someone in here. It is a tragedy. Anne?"" On the other end there was a soft snoring. All feuds aside, it was for the best, she would not have to know. Let Anne sleep."

"event","It was Autumn, and I was lying on a park bench in the morning. I'm pretty sure it was morning, anyway. I could see my breath so it felt like morningtime. It's hard to tell. What time was it? I looked down to my watch, but it wasn't in my pocket like I had thought it was. I patted my front pockets, my rear pockets, coat pockets. Nothing. A sudden wave of uncertainty began to creep all over me. What if night was only an hour away? Was it too late to dine? Where was I supposed to be? I had to find out the time. Panic, panic setting in, panic! A leaf fell on top of my head, and I yanked it off. 'Fuck!' I cried. I had never felt so lost! Then suddenly, I started searching my whole area for this watch. I wasn't sitting on it or standing on it, that was for sure, and I didn't remember throwing it away. I didn't see it in the pile of newspapers. I retraced my steps around the park and found my other shoe, finally, but still no watch. It wasn't in the tree, either! 'Do you think a dog ate it,' I said, but I didn't see any dogs around. Getting desperate I thought about asking someone for help. There were some guys playing hackeysack in the basketball court. Maybe they knew where my time went. I went over to them to ask. Before I knew it, though, I got caught up in their game because watching them play calmed me down some. It's a tough sport, hackeysack, tougher than most people will ever know. I was hypnotized. One of the guys playing came over and asked me if I wanted to join them. I didn't say no. I didn't say anything. I knew that I wanted to tell him, all of them, that I couldn't find my father's old watch. Broken watch, and old. I had taken the watch the last time I saw him, when he told me he didn't want me in his life. He said that I was only standing just to fall down again, and then I stopped being his son finally because that was what he wanted the whole time, a son who wouldn't disappoint him. And then he got this look like I was destroying him and his life he'd worked so hard for. I didn't want to be his failure anymore. 'I never knew him,' I tried to say, after the guy returned to his game. 'He never knew me.'
The guy said back to me, ""Go find him."""

"event","<b>December 12, 4:52 am</b><br />Lobb Monaldson of 9-1-1 dispatch arrived at his desk hungover and irritable. He had slept very little. As he shook himself off, the world around him spun crazily, while the snow from his hair, shoulders, and shoe crevices flew to the floor in thuds and began to melt slowly beneath his feet. To stabilize his footing and mental state, he counted to ten without breathing, mouth frowned, which had become a custom for most mornings. He creaked his body into a sitting position, and farted.<br />From there the old, moldy office in which he had worked for seven years offered no hand-hold to lift him, his spirits. The air was musty. His chair squeakered at every small movement. Telephones ringers, operators, and DECK THE HALLS along with various chatters scratched his ears like many tiny little rakes tilling the ear-bed. He could feel his stomach boiling and roiling, over and over. The heater was broken, and the two nearby windows were almost completely open for an unknown reason. 'Some upper management decision, probably,' he thought, arms crossed and sitting discontent. In fact, he sat miserably. With nothing to help him focus, save stare dismally at his telephone, he only depressed himself moreso. <br />Quickly, he leered at the mug on his desk that had appeared seemingly from nowhere. He knew that it was the silent morning temp who had put it there, though she would have already been gone before he could have seen her, so there was no way to prove it. The coffee was issued on arrival and mandatory. &quot;HELP IS ON...&quot; it read, with the rest of the credo on the side facing away from him. His eyes stuck on it for a while and read through the words slowly, carefully, attempting to stay away from the phone as long as possible. When they could not resist any longer, they slid back. Back and forth, mug to phone, again and again, each with lesser intervals and a sigh in-between. <br />Once, he straightened the pens in the drawer. <br />All the while, he prayed the phone-line would never connect. <br />Sniffling this time, the temp passing by placed an office-wide memo in front of him. It was glued to an elaborate bright green and red tagboard card. This hurt his brain immensely, though he cursed that it may be important, somehow, and to somebody. He unfolded the thing. The words inside were printed in a horrible cursive font. Lobb himself grimaced horribly, and prepared himself for the long hours to come. <br />   <br />&quot;<i>Christmas time is here again! O the joy! O the jingles! Best of wishes to all of you; may your stomachs be full of ham and your chimneys full of Santa. Ours surely will be- my wife Margaret and I shall be vacationing through the New Year. Should you need anything it will have to wait.<br />  Remember this winter that there are those who are impoverished with suffering, with loss. Consider this thoroughly and remember that your job- your wondrously challenging privilege- is not for the worry-wort, the short-tempered, the overly mournful, or the less-than sympathetic. People will lose their limbs. It is cold fact. People will lose their loved ones. People will lose their keys. But people cannot lose their hope. Above all else YOU are the VOICE of that HOPE to calm the panic brought by sudden calamity. You are the voice of reason to deliver our beleaguered callers to safety, however bleak you know that safety to be. You are the rocks upon which such troubled oceans break. <br />  If a man is bleeding to death, relate unto him that you are bleeding for his misfortune, bleeding from your heart, bleeding from your own troubled soul. Make his plight your own. Send an ambulance.</i><br /><i>If a man has been robbed and assaulted, confide in him with the many men who are assaulted daily, hourly; weave his life into a perspective where he is </i><i>assuredly </i><i>not alone. There is someone who is also in his exact position at the very same moment, somewhere. Ask him to think of the help that that man may not be receiving, to contrast the situation at hand. Send the police.<br /></i><i>If there is a fire, pray for rain. Should there be a child be trapped inside, speak to the mother. Ask her if she is a Christian. If she answers yes, let her know that her child will soon be walking and smiling with God. If she answers no, implore her to imagine all of the forms her child may assume in his (or her) next life</i><i>, assuming that such life after death exists, which it very well may not! Reflection of spirituality can be a subtle calming technique. Send a fire truck.</i><br /><i>If a woman has been raped, assure her that she is beautiful, the most beautiful song your ears have ever fallen upon. Comfort her. </i><i>Ask her what she is wearing. </i><i>Make her feel good about being a woman. For emergency purposes, get her measurements; women love to tell men their sexy measurements. Ask her to giggle. If she does not comply, put her on hold, indefinitely. If it is that important to her, she'll call back.&nbsp; <br />  If-&quot;<br /><br /></i>Lobb crumpled the gaudy note and threw it to the trash bin, which was full. Instead it fell to his feet and sopped up the melted snow-water so rapidly that it held like a glob of soiled toilet paper. Another sigh gurgled in his throat. Try as he might, he did not enjoy his boss' sense of humor any more than he enjoyed the dispatch building, or any of the faces to be seen inside of it. He found no solace, no comfort. -NO HOPE- Cold shivers climbed his limbs. He stomped the memo. <br />It was 4:58, and his workday had not yet started.<br />&quot;Vacation, I could fucking use a vacation,&quot; he mumbled. For a moment the image of Margaret lying nude on a beach towel warmed him. She was a beaut. Raven black hair tussled down to the split of her buttocks. Red, red, red lipstick cracked in a smile. He lay next to her on the hot sand, and suddenly the thought was lost when from across the aisle obese Maude read the memo aloud to herself and cackled as her phone-line rang without end. She turned to him, waving the card.<br />&quot;This is too funny! Did you read this, Lobb? Lobb? Lobb? Did you read it?&quot; she shrieked.<br />Not answering, he glared hard into his mug, his black mirror of caffeine, alive with rottenness. He caught glimpses in the surface of how his life had turned wildly upon him. He re-felt the betrayal. He relived the destruction his strange jealousy had caused some time ago with his brother. He couldn't shake the empty stare, not like the snow. He couldn't erase the lifelessness of his brother's hands, fingers, or conjure the voice of hope he never received. -FUCK THIS SHIT- Ever since his own black times -OUR BLACK- woeful and wistfully, humorlessly, he had known only the large bottle of gin aside the table lamp, aside the family photo, calling. Calling. Ringing. Hope, what is hope? he pondered. Where was his hope? Who could he call? Was there anyone in this fucking place he could call? -DIAL TONE- Could he call himself? Would he find the signal busy? Would there be an answer?<br />If he were the one who found himself on the ground his back with the snow softly falling to his face, the sound of muffled car congestions and warm blood melting the ice so comforting serene would he even want to call? Could his fingers manipulate the rescue this time? Was that a smile of relief on the face from beneath the long whiskers and scrapes and scars and ice? Would he just let himself drift away? -DRIFT, DRIFT-<br /> He closed his eyes and covered his face from everyone. He sighed deeply once more, and mentally prepared himself for the many long days to come. <br />5:00.<br /> His coffee, utterly black, steamed cautiously."

"event","<font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">After we had finished, I replaced my socks and shades and pants, kissed Jill on her cheek, and stepped out onto the front yard's lawn for a smoke. I couldn't believe how blistering hot it was. As the Spanish would say, <em>hace calor. Me gusta que fue el viernes.&nbsp;</em>Unfortunately, it was only Thursday. <br />Considering how Jill would be asleep for awhile and I would need to find something to occupy my time, my eyeballs panted lazily around the neighborhood <em>cul de sac</em> for a little distraction. I didn't know what I was looking for, exactly, maybe some kids playing basketball, or a cold drink of water from a hose.&nbsp; garage sale a few houses down that harbored some shade. I thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; and with some time to kill I made my way over. <br />The heat of the street pavement began to distort the modest yellow home in fun-house proportions. Clothes were wilting on their hangers. Lamps gooped and waved like Dali paintings </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">as tables bowed beneath their weights. At first, because of this, I took some pleasure in browsing and forgot the heat. I scuttled through some long cardboard boxes, tried on shoes that didn't fit, or match. All of the vinyls were broken and melted. A slinky that was too unslunk frustrated me- to no small end. Also, just tossed in there, were lava lamps and VHS tapes, a dresser with two drawers missing, an old burned-out chest with some posters and a spider inside. Nothing of any value, at all.<br />Back to the furnace.<br />While leaving, I gave the woman in the lawn chair a smile. She waved back. </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">I didn't make it much farther than that. Not only was she Venus, </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">I noticed something </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">from the corner of my sight&nbsp; on a nearly empty table. It was blue, gold, and stain covered.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">It took but mere moments to realized that it was a fez, which, according to the tag, had been featured in a movie from the thirties.</font> <font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">My fingers danced across the creases of its velvet to the tassel on top as the concrete caught my cigarette.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">      &quot;What movie?&quot; I asked. </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;The Haunted Case of Mister Sheik,&quot; piped some little girl from the garage. She ran behind the freezer.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">    &quot;The Haunted Case of the <i>Mysterious</i> Sheik,&quot; the lady of the lawn chair corrected.&nbsp;<br />Suddenly, I had never seen the sun before. She was statuesque, absolute, her auburn curls and glistening freckled head bouncing my direction, breasts booming and jubilant. <br />&quot;A classic noir film, basically,&quot; she cooed, &quot;though way ahead of it's time. It didn't sit well with audiences considering all the harems and ghosts, the lewdness of the whole thing. That fez was worn by the villain: the Sheik. Try it on. There's a mirror over there.&quot; </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br />I tore my eyes from her for a moment, barely. The fez, a little slimy in places, especially along the rim, veiled a mystique I couldn't place. I put it on, though the mirror was cracked so badly that I couldn't see myself. &quot;Thanks. Does it make me look Armenian?&quot; I asked.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> She smiled. &quot;A little.&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> Her sense of humor- I liked that. &quot;Oh, well. I think this is very interesting, you know. I really enjoy interesting things.&quot;<br />&quot;You could take that to a haberdasher, probably. Get it fixed up.&quot; <br />&quot;I'm sure I could. Is it any good? The film?&quot; </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Couldn't tell you. I've never seen it. Not all of it, I mean. I've seen the credits, that is. And the poster.&quot;<br />I was starting to sweat, now. &quot;I think I saw that over there with all of your other shit.&quot;<br />She said nothing.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Hmm. Ah, well, how did you come across this, then? Seems to me that memorabilia like this is very rare. Grandfather work on the set or something?&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">  &quot;No, actually,&quot; she said, with reluctance, &quot;the hat was given to me. I don't know the man.&quot; </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;How do you even know if it was really in the movie, then? And how come you even know anything about it?&quot; I persisted. Curiosity gave way to more personal musings; I could tell she was flustered. Her breasts heaved. &quot;I'm Malph, by the way. How do you fit in here?&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Hi, Malph. I run this garage sale,&quot; she said, defensively standing at a slant angle, &quot;and have for quite a while. These things I sell here mostly have little, if any, meaning to my life right now. It happens that I like selling them. I like selling my things! You ever just do that and go sell your things? You probably keep everything, I'm sure. That's when they become worthless. You forget the importance that here and there there are some things that really <i>do </i>have more meaning behind them, but you may never have them again- like this fez. I think you should buy it and then sell it someday.&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> &quot;I keep a medium amount of things, I'd say. Now, f I were to buy this from you, can you give me any hist&nbsp; what's the deal? I'm going to buy the thing, you know.&quot; I said. I twirled its tassel in figure eight motions.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">Her face contorted in discomfort. Thankfully, she didn't find my eyes</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">- I would have lost composure- </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">when she started, &quot;...A lot of years ago a man came to my door, a salesman. A big kind of guy. He said he was selling ballpoint pens.&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">  &quot;Nice.&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">She wiped the sweat from her milky brow and waved it away. </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Well, obviously I didn't need any, especially not a damn case of them. I told him no thank you. He told me he would throw in a special if I 'bought today.' I still said no.&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> <br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;See, listen to you,&quot; I applauded. This was apparently very tough for her.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> &quot;He asked if I had any kids that like to draw and I told him to leave. That was when he allowed himself into my home and...became forceful. At first he just looked around at the pictures I kept on the walls and continued to try and sell to me but soon he started shouting and his face got all red and he didn't seem to understand that I didn't want any pens. His eyes...they were just dead. I said something like, 'Please I don't have any money!' and 'Leave me alone!' but he kept saying, 'Why don't you want them? Aren't they good enough for you? I'm sorry you couldn't possibly buy goddamn one!' And he was berserk he just kept going through the house and clearing off every table in a rage and knocking over everything onto the floor. I thought that this man was going to violate me, or something. How am I supposed to know?&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Yeah you never can tell with those people, can you.&quot; I said as if I had been listening.&nbsp; Her breasts seemed to defy man's laws of gravity and my tongue was quite large.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;I locked myself in the bathroom. And I could hear him in the hallway stomping up the stairs behind me. He said he could wait forever. I said, 'then you can just wait until my husband gets home!' and then he said he would. That's when I got so scared because I wasn't married. I didn't even have a boyfriend or anybody I could count on to find me. I'm thinking this when I hear him make these <i>noises. </i>Like moaning, low moaning, '<i>uugghhhhhnn</i>,' right outside the door. What kind of man makes that sound? I stayed in there for over an hour, hoping he would just leave and I could go back to my life. I just wanted to go back to my life. I just wanted to call my mom and he didn't even care that I was crying!&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">She had buried her face in the hot plate of her hands.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> <br />I moved in close as an attempt to console her. When I rubbed her back, though, she jumped. I didn't know what to do. This was not how I pictured this transaction. She was crying, after all. &quot;Shh..&quot; was all I could think to say, though I did think of leaving. </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">She kept talking. &quot;I remember sitting on the toilet, and, staring at the shadow of his feet on the floor. He didn't even move. He wasn't trying to break the door or anything. Then I heard, flick, flick, flick and thought what the hell is that? What the hell is that? His feet, his feet moved away from the door and then there weren't any shadows anymore and it started to smell funny and when I finally knew that I had to get out of there I came out into the hallway with the fucking plunger in hand and my house was on fire. My house was on fucking fire and for all I knew there was some crazed salesman still in there with me so I screamed and ran down to the front door as fast as I could and...and...it happened so quickly...I passed out or something. My neighbors called the police and the fire department, but he was gone! Asshole was gone and I told them what had happened. They said the fire was caused by a napkin falling behind the freezer chest and catching from the pilot light or some stupid shit that wasn't even true because I know I heard him light something with a lighter outside the bathroom. I was the one that was in there, right? Not the detectives or the arson specialist or the fucking news cameras. Just me. Just me,&quot; she sobbed.<br />Gone were her freckles from ever existing, and I noticed she had shrunk by about half a foot in size. As I was practically keeping her on her feet, poor thing, I sat her down in the chair. </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">Was she okay? Maybe not.&nbsp; Should I have paid better attention to her, possibly, instead of how I stared at her breasts and pictured what I would do to her? It was too late.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> I didn't even know what the hell she was talking about. I wasn't there for a pointless story on the hottest day! </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> &quot;Listen,&quot; I said, choosing my words carefully, </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;maybe you should keep the fez. There obviously is whole lot behind this for you as we can see here, with you crying. I don't think I would feel right taking this from you, baby,&quot; I set the fez down and forgot about it.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Baby? I wasn't even finished with the fucking thing you asked me!&quot; she cried. I was reminded briefly of the old hag from Sleeping Beauty; tried not to chuckle. &quot;Why did you even ask? Who the fuck do you think you are? Get the fuck out of here!&quot; </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> This finally lifted my last veil of patience. I spoke curtly. &quot;In all honesty, sweetheart, that was one of the most boring things I've heard in a while and I'm being more than generous, so just get off my back, ok? I come here to your garage sale, hot-as-blazes, and I get yelled at. Great.&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> &quot;Fuck you!&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">&quot;Yeah you're gonna keep a lot of customers that way!&quot; as I walked away.</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia"">Garage sales, so far as I thought, were supposed to be wonderful places, full of unexpected surprises and lost treasures. Seems that occasionally, you'll run abreast of the rare crazy bitch. A crazy bitch who can't seem to get her story straight.</font> <font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> &quot;You fucking asshole!&quot;</font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""><br /> </font><font size=""2"" face=""Georgia""> &quot;Keep shouting, loony! Maybe someone will listen to you.&quot;</font>"

All we had left was a can of evaporated  milk, and everyone knows  that nothing is in there but steam&hellip;&nbsp; <br />What would  happen to us now? <br />&ldquo;What will happen to us now?&rdquo; a friend said. <br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But we should sure try to find some food before we <em>all</em> start  looking delicious.&rdquo; <br />Everyone  nodded, doggedly, either too panicked or fatigued to laugh. I  heard,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; though didn&rsquo;t know who said it. I silently agreed with  them, without really knowing why. It was becoming hard to think clearly.<br />I remembered  somebody saying that they saw a raccoon outside. I still didn&rsquo;t believe  them. <br />&ldquo;We should foray. Have we done that yet?&rdquo; someone said. <br />The  words jolted like electricity. None of us  thought we had tried this,  and immediately it seemed like a smart, albeit crazy, idea. One person  even smiled. And so, we put pots  and pans on our heads and made our way  outside, into the unknown. <br />Up in the tree I  heard a screech owl!  We had to be brave, though. When we reached the end  of the block the  group of us banded together under a street lamp, and I  doled out the  jobs- which was important considering how danger-filled a  night could  be. Our excitement was feverish. I would scan around every corner. He  made pigeon calls.  She bobbed and weaved through tall grasses. He was  going to taste fine  with a white wine vinegar.

I hear it grows at nighttime, when  the moon is scarce,&rdquo; I said. <br />I found a spot of soft soil and started  digging. <br />&ldquo;Even if that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she said, coming up behind me, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a  full moon, asshole.&rdquo; <br />I  glanced sharply, and she was right. The moon was roughly one mile  away  and fast approaching. I felt like vomiting. There was nothing to vomit.<br />&ldquo;Ok. Uh, let&rsquo;s go then,&rdquo; I said. <br />I grabbed her arm and hurried down the street.<br /> &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; I called to the others. <br />Our  sneakers squeaked and pattered beneath us as we sprinted. Homes and  abandoned storefronts stopped, and the open woods began. The wind was  thick, it kept our breaths from escaping to the sky, our hearts beating  so  desperately. <br />It would be days before I realized our strides had   synchronized. We were a pack, now. Single-file. And I could start to  hear what the  others were thinking. I knew well what he was wishing  for, felt that she was very  sad (her brother had died), touched all  numbers and colors, poems and dirges that trickled like fluid across his  cerebrum. I got to his brain and all he could think about was raccoons!  I felt them there with me, too, reeling like wheels within  wheels  within wheels, operating some lonesome mechanism. We flowed, and we  fleeted; we crashed, and we reveled! <br />She  turned to me and said, &ldquo;How are we doing this?&rdquo; <br />And then I said, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, but let&rsquo;s keep running and never eat again!&rdquo;"

Fire! There was a fire! What?! Yes, a fire, they were all there. The midgets escaped in their VW bug, but the monkeys, oh shit the monkeys: well let's say they didn't make it. The girls with the tamborines were singed but they're still singing and dancing at the Brothel next door. Did anyone come to help, I asked? Well not really, said the old man with a hard on, but old lady McFarinn turned on her sprinklers and was screaming like a siren from her rooftop in the nude. In the nude?! I say in shock, she's nearly one hundred years old! Yes, but she is a strong ol' Bird, he said. Suddenly from the east it dawned on me about the crackhead who lives in the basement; where was he? Well, said the old man before I could ask, the crackhead from the basement is how this whole fire got started. Of course he is, I say in my most holiest of tones, what was I thinking? Then the old man put his hand up to silence me and said, don't speak foolishly based on your limited knowledge of crackheads. He didn't start the fire himself, so there is your first misconception, if I am correct? Yes, I say sheepishly, feeling like the most judgmental and ignorant piece of shit. Go on, I say. Well, he was lit on fire by a group of mothers against drugs. Wow! I say, how'd they do it? He rambled a little until: they came in while he was sleeping and doused him with gasoline, and then lit a match. So that's how the fire started? Well sort of, you see the crackhead jumped up and jumped into his bathtub to put out the fire but he didn't realize that the bathtub was full of motor oil! To be precise, it was Pennzoil -the mothers had planned, appropriately, that he would dash there, to the bathroom, first- which caught ablaze immediately. The old man's eyes glanced to his wood, withered like a young, dead tree. He continued saying: as flames licked and climbed the shower curtain and seared the screaming metal of the rings across the rod -I can only imagine- the Crack head screamed as well, didn't you hear it? No, I said, I was asleep! Ah, he said sagely, that is your folly. How can you sleep while monkeys burn in the night? How can you rest while memories vanish to flame? Is it that you were at the Brothel, then? I paused and glanced around for an answer that would sound convincing or true. Nothing came. Yes, I like the atmosphere, I said with a hesitancy. Ah, he said again. He grabbed his knobby boner through his pants and shook it at me. For that I can hardly blame you!"

slunk across the fold of a leaf and sighing deeply.
&quot;Are you okay, little guy?&quot; Teddy said.
&quot;No, actually. I&#39;m terribly disturbed,&quot; The caterpillar said.
&quot;And why do think that is?&quot;
&quot;Well, I&#39;m just having a hard time here. Making friends, you know?&quot;
&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Marie said.
&quot;That is tough,&quot; Teddy said.
A light breeze,
as if gale blown through a feather down
pillow, tiptoed, and for a time not a word was
uttered&nbsp;as&nbsp;the trio of ponderers&nbsp;pondered
the enigma of compatibility amongst peers.
Indeed, a tough one.
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you this, tiny,&quot; Teddy at last imparted, &quot;What makes a friend, anyway?
Common interests? Common circumstance? Eye color?
Possessions? The sound a laugh makes? It is many things, and
you would do well to overlook them. For now, at least.&quot;
&quot;How about I be your friend? I know some places we could
talk or&nbsp;simply enjoy each other&#39;s company?&quot;
Marie blushed.
&quot;Well, you see, small fry, it is not so simple as that, either. We&#39;re humans.&quot;
&quot;I know, I know. But can you blame me?&quot;
&quot;I wish I could!&quot; Teddy laughed.
&quot;We should keep on,&quot; Marie pressed.
&quot;You go ahead, I have a few more words for Mr. Man here.&quot;
Marie did&nbsp;just that&nbsp;and
found the trail to be an
exhilarating place, full of wonders. To think, a friendless caterpillar. What
would they stumble upon next? A misanthropic woodpecker?
A blind bee&nbsp;lamenting&nbsp;his love?&nbsp;A class of&nbsp;nutria
practicing Tai chi on&nbsp;a lark! Certainly a surprise.
Teddy eventually caught up, grinning wildly.
&quot;What is it?&quot; Marie said.
&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; Teddy said, concealing hairy legs in his teeth,
cold antennae in his pupils.</xml:namespace></xml:namespace></xml:namespace></xml:namespace></xml:namespace></xml:namespace>"

Men who paint their faces<br />with no reason and declare nonsense as truth, of government&#39;s<br />and evil,<br />screaming<br />at the wall hangings<br />and light fixtures and clawing unnoticed<br />at the basest thoughts for the <em>real?&quot;</em><br />He takes a moment to write.<br />&quot;When it drizzles and rains sopped in depression I discover<br />exuberance like a cedar log burning;<br />at night these slick roads reflect<br />oranges and ambers or Christmas<br />tones. For me it seems the real<br />gift is disparaging themes<br />of family- deck the halls<br />with a working man&#39;s balls<br />and gritty expression.&quot;<br />He takes another unsatisfied moment,<br />at this point unable to think clearly,<br />then remembers, resigned<br />and lonely,<br />&quot;This one<br />kid asked me what I&#39;m doing,<br />how I am so distant,<br />with his little teeth like a beluga whale,<br />and after I hide my pen and<br />my paper and the wrinkles my forehead makes<br />all I do is smile and<br />then walk away.&quot;"

alright so i want to get at least 10 people together in the woods either in the middle of the day or night, i havent decided, and pick teams. the teams will consist of pairs and there probably be like 5 teams of 2, something like that. after the teams have been chosen we will designate colors to the teams, red, blue, taupe, etc. we will then put on the necessary face, neck, chest, and groin protection. next come the guns. the ammunition for the guns will be potent, but not lethal, color coded tranquilizer darts. now im thinking something along the lines of horse or wolf tranquilizer, just something to knock someone out on contact. once everyone is geared up we will all go our bases, and once the horn blows, start hunting each other for sport. the team with the most kills wins like a trophy or something. 

im serious about this. i need people with like 36 hours to spare sometime. itll be awesome. 

the darts dont even really need to be filled with tranquilizer. i mean id really have to pull some strings to get my hands on the amount im looking for. but we could fill the darts with like say, everclear or kamikazee. i mean what is more fun than a bunch of drunken idiots running through the woods the loaded guns! i really cant think of anything."

today i realized i hold the power of life and death in the words i say. its incredible. i work at a safety supply store. we sell earplugs, vests, cones. we also sell safety harnesses. and respirators. if a customer were to come up to me and ask for a respirator that filters carbon monoxide, i give them the respirator that will allow them to breathe large amounts of poison. 
but what if i didnt? what if i gave him one that only filters noxious gasses? or one that only filters smoke? or a harness that will only hold 100 pounds before shattering? i can feed them shit and they will buy it. and then die. they will die from my misinformation. misinformation that i gave them. misinformation that i think is hilarious.
the power that i possess.

"event","the mind is dual, like the organs by which it is exercised. this idea presented itself to me, and i have dwelt on it for more than a quarter of a century, without being able to find a single valid or even plausible objection. i believe myself then able to prove-(1) that each cerebrum is a distinct and perfect whole as an organ of thought. (2) that a separate and distinct process of thinking or ratiocination may be carried on in each cerebrum simultaneously.

if there is damage to the left hemishpere, where the linguistic skills are normally located, then sometimes the right hemisphere will fill in to the best of its ability. as if another person or mind were thinking. but different from the way you would think. even foreign words you dont know that its learned from peripheral perception sometime during your lifetime."

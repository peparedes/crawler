1. Do you know of any places around here (Raleigh or VA) that are good to get equipment from?
2. What equipment should I look at?  (What's a complete no-no, and what are brands that are awesome?)
3. Any input/info you'd give to someone looking into this sort of information that you'd recommend?

It's in my thoughts right now, and yeah... along with r1ch1e's.  He and I have a plan.  A plan of <b>TWINKIE DOOM!</b>

We're back from Rockport...
Char and I made up... we talked, and... well... she and I both feel like our friendship has sort of... washed out... but... that doesn't mean we can't be friends -- which is good obviously.

I still love her.  But the relationship is different than it has been the past two years.  We've both grown seperate ways and it's good I guess..

It's kind of sad.  But I'm glad that we're changing.  That's healthy.  Not changing is sort of... bizarre.  :)

Otherwise... I <b>really</b> miss Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">], Kenny[<lj user=""elitegrunt"">], and Nick[<lj user=""jclookslikeme"">] :/

I get Sunday around noon at the airport... do any of youuuu want to seeeeeee me, lack of communication is saddening, whee...
 
Especially when you feel like someone doesn't want you to be here... but I don't feel like that anymore.

! Got a new sketchbook !

And I'm also getting that Buzz Lightyear purse tonigh or tomorrow :)  I'm enthused.

When it's for the latter... if they're good at hiding it... they can be mean to you but ""not mean it.""  But if you look them straight in the eyes, their ""front"" breaks, and you can see straight through them.

For some reason I've been feeling that way about a certain person that keeps... falling.  Their actions as a friend aren't as they used to be.  I loved them so much, but they're changing for the worst....

<center>[<b>insert a disgusted look here</b>]</center>
We're making valentines in German class -- I can deal with that.  For amusement during the valentines project, I'm bringing in some music...
Just not sure what yet.  I have to go through my collection and find some stuff thats in German and <i>appropriate</i> for school.  Blah.  I don't feel like debating with myself wheter or not it would be... I mean, the only people that will ultimately understand would be like... <b>six</b> people at most.
*Frau Hartzog
*Paul
*Jake
*Robert
*August [maybe]
*Myself [maybe]
No one else would pay very close attention to it.  So yeah.

I've also got to gather some supplies for art class.  I'm working on a large piece of dry-wall sheet rock stuff... 
So far it looks really *fucking cool*.  I'm excited.  Afraid I'm going to screw it up though.  Getting ideas.  Tossing out some that are dumb.  I have part of a broken motherboard on it.. I think I'm going to rip it off... it doesn't flow with what I've got going... maybe later I'll put it back, who knows?

Since I had all of the work that was due in Computer Math... plus the assignments we're doing tomorrow I'm assuming... I got to leave class after like... fifteen minutes had passed <i>rock</i>.  
Took a quiz in the class today.  Oh my <b>god</b>... I don't think I've <i>ever</i> taken a quiz that was so ridiculous in my life.  I got a 100... and I'll get a 100 again tomorrow on the <i>identical</i> test....<u>
And</u><u>Or</u><u>Not</u>
T&&T=T  T||T=T  !T=F
T&&F=F  T||F=T  !F=T
F&&T=F  F||T=T
F&&F=F  F||F=F

Basically that identical chart.
Blarg.
Yeah.  Ok, so I was bored, so I put the crap you didn't want to know, in.
I don't think I can go see Void Stares Back tonight.
I am one very sad panda :(
Bleh.
Sorry Mars[<lj user=""starplucker"">]... please still be my pal[!!!!].... -sigh-  AND... you should know that I've wanted to see you guys perform well... even before Edna had joined, I'd wanted to see ya do somethin ^^

In the distance I could faintly hear other people outside, rejoicing about the snow, excited that it was here [again].
If you listened <i>really</i> closely at first, you could hear the icy snow falling onto the grass, making a very quiet snapping noise as millions of flakes all hit the ground at once.
Unfortunately, the beauty has worn off, and the roads have turned to slush.
I'm out of school.  But that really doesn't matter... I just got to sleep longer than I usually do on a weekday.

"event","<font size=""1"">Woke up yesterday, glanced at my alarm clock that read -- 9:00am
<b><center>DASH-BAM-ZOOM-SCATTER!</center></b>

<lj-cut text=""yesterday's excursion"">
I threw on my clothes, and caught a ride with my next door neighbor Valarie to school -- it was POURING down rain outside, there was NO way I was walking.

Everyone at my massive amount of cookies I made for German class -- YAY!  

I had to sit through the stupid assembly.  BLEH.  

In government class Dana, Robert, Al, and I played hangman and dots.. Mrs. Royster ended up joining in on the fun during hangman... I was amused ^^

After school Nick and Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">] came over, and we all shimmyed out the door to go... 'do our stuff.'
God I love hanging out with them, it's so much fun.  Without a doubt I can honestly say I have the most fun when I spend time with the two of them [and 2349872 times that when Kenny's[<lj user=""elitegrunt"">] here with us too, heh].  We stopped at the pharmacy *cough* grabbed some lemonade, and headed out to MacArthur Mall, and hopped around there.  

I grabbed a few things in the dollar store : A weird bookbag... it's just like... a strap with a weird back... it's so cute!, some DOTS, weird blue string stuff, a pink braid headband, and... then we shimmyed out again and bopped around the mall. ^^  

We also ran into Kris!  It was so cool :D  ^^  Anjle got some GRODY looking oriental food... it made my stomach QUEASE...

<center>I got sick</center>
... Though I don't think that it had much to do with the food, heh.  After sittin on the floor in the bathroom for like... five minutes, I bounced back out and cheered Nick up... then we went to fye, and listened to their music ^^  Thennn, we shimmyed outta the mall to Nick's... and then to Anjle's... and then... the two of us paraded around her house, got tired and went to bed.

Bop!
:)
</lj-cut>

This morning Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">] and I got up around nine o' clock and went downstairs and had breakfast -- I had my notorious... FROOT LOOPS... oh yes.  Heh.  Then we bounced around the house feeling sick all day with colds and being blah....
I drew most of the body of a cute chixor... [left my sketchbook at her house >:/ ]... and... watched a movie called ""A Little Princess""... it was weird.
Then my mum called, and was all... being cool, and told me about this christmas present I'm getting :
I get to go to Raleigh for a day, maybe two.  Along with Anjle :) to go see Kenny[<lj user=""elitegrunt"">].  I'm enthused ^^
Nick, my godbrother, is going to be like... REALLY close to the area that we're staying in soooo... we're gonna ""hook up"" with him too, and have a shindig with all of 'em together.  Hoowa.  :D
Anyway, I need to get a couple more things done before I sleep, and pack up some stuff, and go to sleep.  I'm uber tired.
Nite!  I'll write at least by the end of the week, :D  Tschus!"

Help.  Plskthx.
Life's so messed up right now.  Stuck at home listening to morbid things about my grandparents in their ending stages of life.  Dealing with my dad being bitchy [for decent reasons I guess, I just wish he wouldn't take it out on me unintentionally], and my mom being stressed out.  Tired of school and the morons that populate it.  Away from <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/elitegrunt"" target=_""new"">him</a>.  And just generally being really aggravated, and horribly moody as of late.

Tomorrow I'm spending the night at Anjle's[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">].  She's started on her skirt -- I however, have not, and am going to begin, and hopefully finish before I leave... and <i>THEN</i>... I'm also making a doll, and finishing making some hair.  *<b>CHAOS</b>*
If school weren't in the picture, and I had a job, I wouldn't <i>care</i>... but this <i>isn't</i> the situation, so everything just... suck.

Anyway.  On-line ""life"" is pointless right now.  I don't <i>do</i> anything except chat, read, listen to music, and poke around on the internet.

- Today began with someone jumping in front of me at school with a camera and taking my picture.  Then proceeding to haul ass the opposite way.  Western Branch morons : <b>GROW THE FUCK UP</b>.
- I argued more with Ms. Lee, along with Chris, Phil, and Jane on my side about my art piece, as well as theirs [apparently we're still doing it ""wrong""]
- Stayed after school for extended day and the entire hour and a half I spent working on a drawing of a chick with huge neon synthetic hair, a neon pink vinyl dress, neon green and black stripeys, and some weird assed maryjanes I created :D
- Arrived at home to find Holly waiting outside in her Sonata... she got the job she's been waiting for[!!!]
- Went off shopping with Holly for hair stuff -- picked up 
Purchased 
* Two rolls of weird colorful plaidish ribbon
* Two packages of cheap markers
* Four sheets of blue foam-y crap
[das ist alles]
{Holly's making green felt hair, heh}
- Came home and hung around here... drawing more, and... being tired... speaking of which, I'll go to bed

"event","<font size=""1"">Well well well... 
I've gained inflated status today.  Moreso than normal.
Nothing too unusual as far as clothing or makeup is concerned... nothing dealing with aesthetics for once...
This time, I made an ass of myself during the fire drill...
First highlight of the day : 
<center><b>I fell on my <i>ass</i></b></center>.
HEH.
I scraped up both of my knees -- leaving my purple striped stockings in the state that they were previously -- unharmed.  ;]
Robert laughed at me -- asshole.

Second highlight of the day :
After scanning some art in the art room during lunch, I was going back to the lunchroom to socialize or whatever for like the five minutes that I had left of lunch with my friends Marli, Nicole, and Donaka.  Before I could even get down half of the corridor... I was surprised to see [what looked like a freshman] a boy standing hunched over next door to one of the technology classrooms... I thought he was irritated, before I started to notice a small, pale puddle next to the door of this room...
""<i>Er... I'm going to go get the nurse for you!</i>"" 
""... I... <b>need</b> to call... -spew- my mommmm...""
-Pam runs to the lunchroom, throws her things on the table, and gets a teacher who contacts the security, who gets the nurse -- craziness!-

Poor kid.
I remember spewing in class... in second grade.  My teacher didn't believe I was sick...
<b>Bitch</b>.

Third highlight ?
Argued with Ms. Lee, along with Phil, Jane, and Chris on my side about how our abstract pieces were dandy, and that she shouldn't give us zeros -- supposedly NOW we're not allowed to have black in the piece. 
Bleh, I wish she'd make her bloody mind up once in a frigging while... sheesh!

And well... the rest of the day...
Was mediocre I suppose :)"

"event","<font size=""1"">Well, the Mindless Self Indulgence show last night was a bunch of fun.  I saw a <b>ton</b> of people from school, the clubz0r, and on-line... bloOp...
Shan[<lj user=""sinthetik"">], joDi[<lj user=""djragdoll"">], Ori[<lj user=""industragthchik"">], Kathy[Ori's mum], Sam, Danielle, David[<lj user=""vizionz"">], Leslie, Ant, Vicky, Ben, Turquoise, Turtle, Cass, Bill, Mikey, Kris, Marshall[<lj user=""starplucker"">], Pugsley[<lj user=""deathrocker"">]Cat, and Crystal[<lj user=""porcelain_angel"">], Logan[don't really know him], and I'm sure there are some people I'm forgetting... it was really neat, I'd never been to a show that so many people were attending [those that I knew at least].
Holly, Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">] and I all went together.  We had fun.  Holly wore her first dose of synthetic hair -- it was red.  Heh.  
I really enjoyed myself at the show... 
The first band pretty much... just kind of sucked... in <i>my</i> opinion.  Heh.  But I'm not really all that into the newish nu-metal stuff anyway.   Plus the guy was in dire need of shaving his legs -- he was wearing a dress and it just looked <b>retarded</b>.  Blar.  So yeh.  I was in the pit with all of my friends, and we were fucking around eating ice out of each other's hands, having ""fuck you"" contests [don't ask, it's <b>stupid</b>... Cass and Bill came up with it], and generally just goofing off during the down time when the bands weren't performing.
I purchased a Jimmy Urine t-shirt, along with their cd <u>Alienating Our Audience</u>

errr
and I have to cut this short
nick and anjle have jsut arrived
tschus! [/end Saturday's entry]

[begin Sunday's entry]
So anyway... bought more shit I didn't need, and I hung out with my friends in the pit.  
When Mindless Self Indulgence finally came on stage, they put on a magnificent performance.  I loved it.  The whole crowd was hyped and energetic.  Anjle and I were suffering and screaming together [sometimes actually in semi-fear that we were about to get trampled and <b>die</b>...] But... we got through it together :)
After the show was all done and over with, Jimmy Urine was touching people's hands, and signing tickets and what-not...
I drifted away from the crowd, and just went and talked to Holly and Anjle instead.  Then Ant came up to me, and introduced himself.  It was neet.

<center> <b>ALSO</b> :{ I asked like 92873134 people if they had seen Gabe[<lj user=""oozeroo"">] 'cause I wanted to hang out with him after the show... and apparently he didn't get to attend... I was <b>so</b> sad :/  Sowwy Gabe-ness!</center>

Bleb... so then I was compelled to go get my ticket signed, so I shoved my way up to the area where Urine was standing, and he finally got to my ticket after signing a shoe or two.  He grabbed the ticket, signed it, and looked straight at me, proceeded to <b>squeal</b> the word/noise ""ahhh, hiiiiii!!!!"" and molest my hair [read: Neon pink/Neon green wrapped yarn/rexlace hair -- FGWSSS cd colors].  I was highly amused.  Then I skipped off  ^^

After the concert, we ran around outside for a little while, and were invited to Ori's house...
Holly, Anjle, and I were really tired and <b>very</b> thirsty, so we went down the street from the Norva to go to the Texaco & McDonalds in hopes that they might be open still [it was eleven o' clock].  Neither of them were open.  We went up to the window where the ladies were counting money, and they just... failed to ignore that we were even there when we tried to ask a question.

<center>BITCHES!!!!!!</center>

After that, we all went back to Holly's car, and were starting to drive away, and these retarded ghetto girls that were standing by the glass window that we were just at were screaming some shit at us... so....
Anjle and I decided to crawl out of our normal shells [normal being... we don't respond to morons, we just ignore them]...
We screamed some random things, gave them the happy finger, and got them <b>very</b> riled up...
I was highly amused. 
Apparently <i>We wassa hot mess</i>
Did you get that?
I'll repeat it for you :
<font size=""4""><i> WE WASSA HOT MESS YO!</i>
</font size>

I wish people now-a-days in America would fucking speak English.  Heh.
After all of that, we all went and finally found a gas station out in Ghent nearby where Ori lives, and we got sodi-pops for all of us... we were all really tired by that point, and we just wanted to go home -- so we stopped at 7 Eleven for food, and transported ourselves back to our places of sleep -- Anjle at myself at her house, and Holly back to her own.

End of story."

<center>Mindless Self Indulgence at the Norva.</center>

Woot.  It will be a great deal of fun I'm sure.  There are a <b>bunch</b> of kids from school in attendance, along with plenty of other people.  I am enthused.

In... preparation for the wonder:filled show that I will be going to tomorrow night, I themed my hair by the colors that they used on their cd ""Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy.""  Neon pink [yarn] and neon green [rexlace].  This time, it's <i>in</i> my hair... or rather, <b>on</b> my hair.  I actually got the nerve up to do <b>wraps</b>.  Have I learned from this experience?  Yes.

Lessons that I have learned :
a. Always even out each piece of your hair first -- tie each section up with small rubber bands before you begin braiding.
b. Either 1] Braid all of the hair by yourself TIGHTLY or 2] Get someone else to braid them TIGHTLY -- rubber band the ends
c. If you're a picky-assed bitch like I am about the way that the wraps look... do it yourself.  

Crystal[<lj user=""porcelain_angel"">] helped.  Thanks to Crystal.  However...
I guess her style of wrapping was just <i>not</i> to my liking.  Too loose... too blobby... not uniformed... not... tight, at all.  
Sorry dear!
Stick with dying, or work on wraps... :P  

Anyway.  I have to finish the back of my head tonight -- that is going to be one hell of a bitch to do.  

Tomorrow is MSI... I want to look cute.  I have no flipping clue what I'm going to wear.
<center>The debate begins.</center>
Hum.

I'm really irritated with school right now.  I just want to get out[!!]... doesn't this <i>always</i> seem to be the case though?  

I got a lot of compliments on the yarn-y-ness today... but... yeah.  Peh[!!!].

I'm thinking about re-dying my hair magenta[pink].  That was really cute, and I want to have a color theme for Christmas/New Years... I think that would look good.

I've done two gift drawings [a couple of people are getting a drawing or something similar with their Christmas pressies] within the past two days, and they're turning out much better than I expected.  Now I just have to get them mounted, and coated with the graphite stuff so that they don't smudge [they're in pencil].  

Algebra II sucks.
I'm dropping Chemistry next semester, and switching English classes too.  Oh yay.
Schedule next semester <i>should</i> be...
1 German III
2 Art 3/Studio Art
3 English 12
4 Computer Math

I should just <b>drop</b> everything, take afirst and second block [English/German], and jet.  Heh.  But I have a desire to take the other two classes, so I might as well... just deal with having a full schedule my second semester of my senior year.

<center>High school <strike>is</strike> <b>is not</b> the best time of your life</center>.

{Crystal[<lj user=""porcelain_angel"">] dyed it for me again ^^}

Today I basically slept 'til nearly 2pm, got up, helped out around the house with various things, and then headed out to my grandparent's house for the Thanksgiving shin-dig that I was required to attend -- I always feel so awkward at those things.  Everyone absolutely loves and adores me... but... I always feel <b>very</b> uncomfortable around them, and I'm not sure why.  Ah well, whatever.

After I got back home, I went to the club with Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">], Cat, Mike, and Ana.  Crystal and Ben showed up later on.  It was an amusing night.  I saw Vicky :D  anddd... the boi whose name has slipped my mind at the current moment -- one of Ori's[<lj user=""industragthchik"">] friends.  And... I also saw the guy that was running my Resident Evil scene at the <a href=""http://www.hauntedforest.com"" target=_""new"">Haunted Forest</a>.  He's kind of weird o_O  Heh.
Anjle danced with me!  It was teriffic ^^  She does this adorable little shimmy-shake with the whole industrial-style-dance.  I loved it ^^  Kimmy was also there... and some of the other normal club-going people.  BloOp.  We finally left after they played Malice Mizer - ""Illuminati"" for Cat, Mike, and Ana.  -blink-  They danced some little dance from the video O_o  And they all froze together.  It was somewhat... disturbing ^^;;  

Random comment : There is an EBM cover of the Beatle's song ""Elanor Rigby""... I am very amused ^^  It's on this free CD that I got with my Feindflug CD a while back -- I just decided to listen to it today.

Anyway... I'm <b>extremely</b> tired.  I did a <b>LOT</b> of punching, stomping, spinning, bouncing, and generally just moving about the dance floor in a very... psychotic[?] manner.  Heh.  It was fun.

I'm working on great art.  I am enthused... now that I think about it... I don't want to be on-line [Pam must be sick, huh? :P].  I want to be in my room, drawing.  I'm working on something really cool :P

My self-esteem has risen. 
I have created, and am pleased.  I am working hard, and am happy with the results, I'm not sick of myself [right now], and it feels great.
I'm sewing.  I'm drawing.  I'm coloring.  I'm making.  I am... not afraid of failure as much anymore... I think.
Maybe I can get myself all the way out of the hole...
I just need a few more shoves, and I'll be out of it, I think ^^;;
 
Ok, some of you might not understand... most of my friends should understand though... the ones that know me well at least... me and my paranoid-self >.<  Heh.

Anyway.  Life is great.  Except for Algebra II [yeah, I understand the current material... but not the last stuff, which... uh, resulted in a not-so-good-grade >.<]

Cya[!]

[ps] Last night I went and saw the Ring again.  I *adore* that movie.  ;]"

I am absolutely in love with this song.  I thought that I'd share.
<br>
<br>
<b>Artist :</b> Cure, The 
<b>Album :</b> <i>Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me</i>
<b>Song :</b> ""Just Like Heaven""

'Show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream' she said
'The one that makes me laugh' she said
And threw her arms around my neck
'Show me how you do it
And I promise you I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you'

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
To make her glow
'Why are you so far away?' she said
'Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
That I'm in love with you'

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heaven"

"event","<font size=""1"">Well this weekend has been somewhat amusing, if I do say so myself.

I <b>DO</b> apologize if any of you made some sort of attempt to go to the Chicago play, as I was not in attendance, unfortunately.  I wanted to go, very badly.  But if you did go, you obviously didn't miss the wonder:full performance that my friends and company put on :)  I was told that they did a great job.

To Corey[<lj user=""tinhalo"">] : Sorry that I missed you on Saturday!  I got in about fifteen to twenty minutes after you'd stopped by -- I was out with Nick and Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">].  So yeah ;/  If you see this today, and you happen to be in the general vicinity of WB, stop by and say hi :)  I miss ya!

Anyway...
Friday night I went off with Anjle and Nick, and he went into a weird mood, so... the two of us, went back to her house, and worked on some hair projects for a couple of hours.
She and I finished the next morning.  She has black and neon pink hair now, and I have a ton of red and black stuff, and it's <b>really</b> cute ^^  I'll try to take some pictures of it later for the fakehair community or something.  BloOp.
I'm also buying Anjle's red/orange and black poofy dreads from her, because they complete the ensemble very well ^^ I'm enthused, heh.

Saturday was apparently the Nick and Anjle day-together, so I went home, and got together with Holly[!].. who now has a new car.  Very nice, if you ask me ;)  <b>THE TANK</b> is now gone.  Heh.  They only got $200 for it.  >.<  Hehe.
When Holly arrived I was still putting in my masses of synthetic hair [it was falling out -- Anjle had tied them in too loose so I fixed 'em :D], and then we shimmyed [yes I said shimmy... or whatever :P] to her place, and showed her car off to her mum.  Thennn, the two of us went out to Norfolk only to be informed that there was a massive parade going on >.<  Heh... so we left there, and went back to Chesapeake.

The two of us went out to dinner at Olive Garden, and then headed out to Harbor View to see the Ring.  
Now... most people I've spoken to, have given this movie a positive response.  Two however, have not.
What <b>I</b> think of it:
<center>I loved it.</center>

I thought that it was filmed well, and it was generally a good movie... I mean... it is the very <b>first</b> movie that has genuinely <i>scared</i> me.  <b>A lot.</b>  Holly and I left the theatre in semi-shock.  
One of the characters reminded me of something that kind of... ""scarred"" my childhood, as far as being frightened.  So... that stuck out like a sore-thumb and sort of bothered me. However... it was terriffic.  The feeling of actually <b>being scared</b> to death, by something that's definitely <b>not real</b> but just bizarre was wonderful.  I've never had that kind of energy in me recently.  And it's refreshing to realize that HEY! it really DOES still exist.  It just takes a lot more for my buttons to get pushed to their limit.  And... this movie did it.

After all of that was done and over with the two of us headed out to Food Lion -- I wanted to buy Dots -- I forgot that Food Lion <b>stopped</b> selling Dots :(  Damn them.  So I got the cheese-ball Mike and Ike candy.  
We also ran into Pat[<lj user=""inqbus"">] while we were there, and the two of us talked for a few minutes... I was a bit spaced after that movie though, so I wasn't really entirely there as he was talking about djing for a party-or-something.
Then Holly and I returned to her house, and took her brother up to the Shell station to get a cigar, and then we all went back to her house, and watched Joe Dirt -- Holly fell asleep.
THAT movie was... okay... and... weird.  I suppose it was something to help un-wind the feelings of anxiety that were brought on by the Ring -- didn't help Holly.

After the movie, I fell right to sleep.  She couldn't sleep in her room, so she came back downstairs and slept on the sofa adjacent to mine, and left cartoons playing on the television.  At 4am, she woke up, and started like... crying out ""PAM!!!... HOW DID THE TELEVISION TURN OFF!????????""  And she started flipping out, and I was so tired, and I hadn't woken up yet, that *I* flipped out.  Then my rationale sort of kicked me and was like ""Hey, her parents must have turned it off.""  So I tried to calm her down, it didn't help too much, so she just turned it back on, and the two of us went back to bed.
It happened again about two hours later, but she didn't spazz about it.  Heh.

Anyway, I'm sick of rambling.
I'm going to go call Nick and Anjle again.  Damn it.  Heh.
:P

"event","<font size=""1"">Well it's finally the weekend.  <i>Yes</i>.  I am completely enthused ^^

Everything has been <b>wonder:full</b> for the past two days [for the most part]
- I understand <b>everything</b> that's going on in Algebra II... what more could I ask for[???]
- I passed my government test [not by a lot, but I passed none the less ;) -- her tests are hard]
- I looked fab today, and had several <i>teachers</i> give me compliments... hoo-wa ;)
- Tonight I'm probably going to go see our school's performance of Chicago with Anjle[<lj user=""strangeasanjles"">] and Nick :)  
- Corey[<lj user=""tinhalo"">] bought me a Goteki CD[!!!]  AHHH, I'm soooo happy about that, thank you Corey :)  -hugs- <3!
- I don't have homework
- I drew my first... YES FIRST... GUY... that... <b>LOOKS LIKE A GUY!</b> [read: I have this problem with making my guy drawings far too feminine... I think it has to do with the girlie boys that I hang out with :P]  And he's[<lj user=""elitegrunt"">] soooo kyoOt as a cartoon ;)

I've been telling random people hello all day.  I feel so... alive.  Not sure why.  Everything is just... great right now.  My natural high.  I wonder what adventures this weekend is going to bring to me.

We're working on another very cool project in art, and I'm super enthused about that...
PLUS... I'm almost done with the first page of my comic, which... when I'm done, I'll show you guys [I'm coloring it in Paint Shop Pro -- not Adobe, but I like it :P].

[!]
Things I'd *like* to get done this weekend :
- Finish sewing my purple/black dress [it's gonna be faboO!]
- Listen to lots of the Cure :)
- Wear large amounts of synthetic hair
- draw
- see Holly
- hang out with Anjle and Nick
- finish making my red/black synthetic hair :)

<center>CHICAGO</center>
Come tonight to see Chicago being performed at Western Branch High School[!!]  It's the last night of the play -- but it's <b>great</b>
We're in Chesapeake.
If you're coming from Chesapeake Square Mall :
* Go down Portsmouth Boulevard [away from the interstate]
* Take a left onto Taylor Road
* Take a right onto Bruce Road
* Take a left onto Bruin Drive[?] at the light -- either way, it will be your 8th left [including entries into church parking lots]
* The school should be on your immediate right after you pass some houses on your right, and town houses on your left

I hope to see some of you there :)  It's going to be great.
Me and my sunset pink-ness will definitely be there[!!]"

[begin rant]
Ever... felt like you were going to <b>die</b>?  
Ever... felt like you'd already met your death?
Been stuck at home for long periods of time...?
Here, let me give you an idea about how it feels.

00:00am[random time] -- You wake up in the middle of the night, to feel something that feels <i>like</i> your intestines pushing against your flesh because they're so incredibly irritated.  Sometimes you vomit.
You go back to sleep.
7:00am -- You wake up, because you have to get sick, again.  Everything that you consume, you end up reviewing.  Your life is <font color=""red"">HELL</font><font size=""1"">.
You are weak, and you go BACK to sleep for a while to rest, after you make an attempt to take the 98783423 medications that you've been put on.
11:00am -- You wake up officially.  The sun is still gone -- it's been raining, you realize that you haven't been sleeping for the weekend, you've been sleeping all day -- when you <b>should</b> be at school.  You cringe in disgust.
11:30am -- Sometimes you're sick some more, just depends when your body wants to be an ass.
11:35am -- You do what schoolwork is available to you - at home.  You actually begin to miss what outside communications that you used to have... now they're dead.

You're on-line, getting sick every-so-often.  Doing school work off-and-on, taking short naps, and being mad that you're by yourself -- as usual.

Finally when the night comes around, you lie in bed, and try to sleep while your stomach is screwing up, and hurting like hell.


This is the way that I can describe my life in the most simple form.
I *miss* school.
I *miss* art class.
I *miss* going out with my friends.
...
I feel like I'm <i>dying</i>.
How would you feel if you couldn't <b>consume</b> anything without getting sick? ... Probably not too happy.
I'm ... way over the days to fail in school.
Limit = Nine days.
I've missed = [as of today] Fourteen days

I'm too tired for this bullshit.  I'm going to do some more school work, and sleep some more, and... be dead to the world.

d00dzor... if I'm ever in Canada... I'm sooo stopping by, to be like ""WTF MUFFUCKA... wut 'chu doin on 'da net?  GETUP WHAT?!""
Don't ask.  Because I really, don't have answers.  You're talking about the chick... who... dyed her hair magenta on impulse.  ;]  With full knowledge her parents would HATE it.  w000
But dude, yeah, you rock.  You're a great artist [from what I gathered], and... you've just gotta keep yourself dedicated to your passions and stuff.  Don't let yourself get down about stuff, just keep sticking to it, and things will work out in the end.  I mean, maybe life can sometimes suck... but doesn't it for everyone sometimes?  You just gotta let time work its magic, and you'll be outta that place, and somewhere where you might even be able to find a job that you actually enjoy [what a thought!  :)]
I love you so much Mal!  You are great, and all of that stuff.  
It seems like all of my friends are great... hell, they're my friends, they are ;]

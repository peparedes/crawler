"event","i found this online. i found it amazing. 

walking down the hall 
with her head held high, 
every hair is in place. 
she sees a friend and waves. 
wearing a smile 
on her perfect face. 
friendly, smart, beautiful. 
everyone adores this girl
seemingly content-- 
her head in a while. 
and inside she's unhappy 
and she doesnt know why. 
she lays in bad at night & cries 
she doesnt know what causes the tears. 
how could this princess-- 
have insecurities or fears? 
she has it all. 
a pretty smile, many friends, 
a great guy, the newest trends.. 
her family has money and 
she gets good grades. 
has her own car and-- 
her make up never fades. 
always looking happy 
every single day. 
but inside she's feeling a 
different way. 
this wonder girl. 
she's everyones dream
but things arent 
always what they seem."

Wait for the boy who will be your best friend, the person who will drop everything to be with you at any time of the day no matter what the circumstances. Wait for the boy who makes you smile like no other...and when he smiles you know he needs you. Wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats and have no make-up on. Most of all, wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe, because obviously he's the center of yours."""

soo during our break a few of us went to go hang out at the prom commitee babysitting. i didnt babysit. i was playing games haha. 
then we went back down to the gym watched coach kill the little kids. then i did the whole counselor thing haha. then we ended

then we got backl tot he school around 230 and played our srimmage vs. dennis//yahmouth. haha
we didnt do thatt bad. much better than last scrimmage. i think i did well. 
thenn after the scrim i talked to graham for a bit. took a shower. and decided that me and jimmy would go shoppin!
soo he came and picked me up. then we went and visited erika! i bought a few presents then we went to see kristine and talked to her on the side of the road. aahaha 
then we went to molls wit rach laura and bryan. good times good times. 

ooh! and i got to drive in the ""tahoe"" instead of the ""caddy"". jimmy has the largest cars ever! they r beastss!

Seemed to stop my breath 
my head on your chest
waiting to cave in from 
the bottom of my...
hear your voice again could we dim the sun
and wonder where we've been maybe you and me 

so kiss me like you did my heart stopped
beating such a softer sin
lay with me now

never caught my breath 
every second im without you
I'm a mess ever know each other 
trust these words are stones 
why cuts aren't healing
learning how to love, I'm melting

in your eyes i lost my place
could stay a while and i'm melting
in your eyes like my first time
that i caught fire just stay with me
lay with me 
            stay with me 
                          lay with me now

you can stay and watch me fall
and of course i'll ask for help
we could take our hands off 
stay in bed just make love thats all
just stay with me now

I'm melting, I'm melting
in your eyes i lost my place
could stay a while and i'm melting
lay with me
              stay with me
                              lay with me now
in your eyes lets sleep til the sun burns out

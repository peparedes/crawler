"event","Sometimes I think about all of the great playwrights and authors and what they have accomplished and how they got there and I look at my life and see that they were on a slightly more progressive track than I am.  Not that I want to be an author or a great playwright. We were talking about Beckett today in Modern Irish Drama and It dawned on me that I am a lot smarter than I give myself credit.  I don't want to sound like I am being cocky or anything, but it is true, however, i really don't apply myself.  I apply myself in my acting classes, however, I feel like it's really easy to apply myself in that because they are so instinctive.  I really don't read books as much as I should.  I don't write as much as I should. I've never explored another country. When I used to go back to Peru I would just go to the horses and kind of stay in my one little world.  I don't play music as much as I should.  I want to be multitalented. I want to be a great photographer. However, sometimes i feel like those things require more time than I have.. time that costs money that i don't.  

I really want to do what i used to do and write monologues like everyday. On my old computer I would write a journal on a Word Doc. then look at it the next day with a specific character in mind and try to make it so it would a different way.. appropriate to the character. I should do that, it was fun.  I used to be at least semi proficent in writing.  I used to love to read novels.  And I used to love failing at dance & music.  I don't know why I really don't let myself fail anymore.  

I mean I know that I am at New York University, getting pretty damn good grades and recieving a kind of respect from my teachers but there is part of me that wants it all and doesn't want to stop until she gets it, but part of me knows that it will take a little extra energy on my part to get that 'not stopping' started, and that I don't know if that will ever happen."

silly brunettes and their digital cameras.

i went to this ""fashion show"" at my working place called <i>fashionably healthy teens show and movie</i> (mean girls).
basically, the lesson was--if you show skin you are asking for men to treat you badly..  and since men are too stupid to decifer that you aren't supposed to treat ANY girls badly...its all okay so you better dress modestly. yep. and abstience is the ONLY method of contraception.. you have to wait till you're married... but gays.. they can just fuck whatever whenever because they don't want them to get married....

i hate fargo. save me!

"event","oh so i have this funny story about work:

so im working at the fargo theatre the other day and this guy from, i guess he says california comes in to look at the theatre. he said he'd been there before and seemed really excited to talk about it with me... (he talked really quietly and had like white spit stick to his lips when he talked.. but i ignored it cus im nice like that) anyway... he starts talking about how movies aren't made the same as they used to be, randomly i would try to add to the conversation but he wasn't really having it so i just remined quiet and let this old guy that loved himself a lot, evidently, talk. anyway he starts listing all the movies he'd seen recently that were worthy of the 10 dollars he  paid to get in. One on his list was Hotel Rwanda. He said this about the film:

""Yeah. Hotel Rwanda was really good.""
me- ""oh yeah thats what i heard, i havn't gotten to see it y--""
""Yeah, being a person who has traveled to Africa a couple of times, <b> I could really relate to that</b>""


yeah.. you guys munch on that one for awhile."

i learned one thing from my studio classes at nyu.. act like you are on an audition and you will never slack off in a class. and because i havn't been slacking off my ass hurts like a .. hurtz donit.???

i miss people.
like... steven.
and bryce (but hes coming in a couple o' weeks)
and.. my roomates for next year.
and. boys i have crushes on. tee hee.

i miss dressing well. for some reason my fashion sense goes away here. i noticed it during christmas and now. i think now its because i work every day in either express uniform (dressed up and ""professional"") or fargo theatre (black pants, black shirt). oh well.. i think at least i came back full force 2nd semester so im not so worried that im lost forever.

nikki owes me 5 dollars. 
the only reason i bring that up is because i payed for her to go to a show. the one and only show i've gone to since i've been home and not that the bands weren't good but i just don't feel like going to anymore.. i like to not be looked at like im crazy if i feel like busting loose? at a show. 
god dammit
bryce hurry up get drunk, get naked and bring back some liveliness.

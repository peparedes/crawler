soo this girl came in talking about a free exchange program to go to Quebec to live with a family.. to learn french and to work... i really really wanna do this. This is such an amazing opportunity and i wish my family could back me up with this and suck it up for 6 weeks and take a kid in. Its absolutely free and it'd be an experience of a lifetime. I wanted to quit my job newayzz this is the perfect opportunity to meet new people and experience a different culture..  6 weeks seems like such a long time and it is in a sense but i feel like i could do this. I have a desire to learn French i really want this. In essence i would be giving up soo much yet gaining that much more... i really need to have a serious talk with my whole family about it... i wanna do this, WHY is my family soo wary about everything????? i guess ill just have to see how things unfold.

ook well after that slight outburst moving on.. ummm yes hes cut.. Hes scarin me.. i always run from these guys who proclaim their love for me.. its a problem. it scares me more than impresses me... i dunno i dont wanna break this kids heart... hes great but im scared of him....

School sux major ass.. i ust wanna give upp im so sick and tired of all the crapppp...i really need to get back on track and FOCUSSSS!!!"

Friday the day b4 my bdayy went to Stephs used her sauna.. and made perogies and smoothies. Later we went and got pedicures. (Yay feet for sandals now... not so pretty before =S) Then Saturdayyy, my actual birthday I got soo many phone calls and text messages from all my friends and family. Honestly tha made my day. I got that validation i said i had wanted a few entries ago. 

Then Steph came over brought me coffee and a cupcakeee with the candles and everythingg. She came in with this huge basket she made for my birthdayy filled with all my favorite things... like Chocolate and the book A million little Pieces, slippers, and a shirt. But best of all she got everyone to sign a card for my bday. like EVERYONE.. which made my day. I kno she workedd soooo hard to put this together for me by getting everyone to sign the card.. and putting togetherr a gift i would love.. i dont think Steph even realized how much i really appreciated it.. and if she ever comes round to reading this.. Thanx bitch i dunno wut i'd do without you!! Then a little while later Jenn and Amber came by and brought me my present..panties and shirtss (My favvv .. i really liked them) Thenn we all drove to Tony Romas.. FOOD was SOOO good.. (Thanx Mom for paying) We all had sexy drinks  and Amber attacked a waiter LOL.. "" HEY YOU ARE U NATHAN????""LOL.. After dinner we went to YUK YUKs.. it was sooo jokes.. well damn right it shoulda been.. it was a comedy club duhh.. it was really good.. soo like after thattt we were just drivingg aroundd and ended up going to A&P where Jenn bought me a bday cake =D then we went back to my house stuffed our faces  and ""rode the magic carpet"" lmao.

Sundayy my family came over to celebrate my bday with me it was really good dinner(thanx mom) andd it was funn ""family bonding time"" 

I really couldn't have asked for more i had an awesome bdayy and im so thankful.. for everyone who thought about me and made me feel so special. Who called, wrote, or textedd <3,<3,<3x1 000 000 000 000

I feel like its not that important newayz its just neother day. i really hate my birthday. everyone's asking me wut i want and yada yada.. and really i don;t want anything i just want sumone to actually remember and just simply wish me a happy bday... sounds pathetic, i kno, and kinda stupid, i kno, i just feel like i need that validation.. nothing more and nothing less

so this guy situation wut ive realized since then..im firstly joining the convent. Just call me sister Nessa...i might as well devote myself to jesus since i can;t devote myself to anything else.

guy #1: i still love you, you keep me smiling and guessing. Thank you for all the things you say and do for me. You're my best friend. I kno we could never be and will never be. And frankly i wouldnt have it neother way. i dunno wut i'd do without u. U never cease to amaze me and keep me guessing and laughing.

guy #2: ur almost perfect, you are perfect.. together we have no chemistry. U make me feel special, i kno u adore me. I don't wanna hurt u, but i more than likely will have to.. becuz i can't create feelings that aren't sumwhat there.. i don't get that ""feeling"" when you are near me. 

guy #3:you are the sweetest guy ever...and make me feel amazing despite all my nerd or...non-conventionally-flattering atributes... but yeah besides that..im srry for making you try so hard.. you would be perfect if i wasnt the way i am.. we will chill sumtime i promise you. But we're in such different places in life.. its hard.

I love talking to him i feel like he teaches me so much and hes so understanding and he really likes me regardless of me being a loserr and stupid and pretty&nbsp;naive i guess in comparasion to himm.&nbsp; i love that hes older and he drives and &nbsp;his friends are so sweet and funny too hes such a great guy. Hes so family oriented and hes hardworking and&nbsp; this guy wants to gimme the moon and moreand &nbsp; take me out and treat me like a princess.&nbsp;But i feel like we're in such different places it would be difficult.&nbsp; but there are so many things i luv he wants to show me a good time and have fun and live my life.&nbsp;i love how he got lost driving me home and played it off like he was gonna teach me to parallel park thats soo cute.

Good for him.

I over analyze and over think everything before anything really happens.For a fact its important to do that now in this circumstance.. this is a small taste of what I want for the future..but am I looking to the future too soon? But really.. thats the least of the issue really... So how old is too old at our age? They say ""age aint nothing but a number"" and "" opposites attract"" but where does the whole shock of any age difference stop?2 years? 3 years? 4 years older? What about coming from similar yet so different worlds???  everything in common? nothing in common?  i can't figure out whether i want to go there.

So many memories that will stay with me for years to come happened this year that though not always good but with good came bad and i can now look back and laugh and not take it as serious as i had. I feel like i have so much to look forward to in 2006. The people i have shared and made memories wil never be forgotten and hopefully there will be more crazy, funny, stupid, bad mistakes and memories together. 2006 holds few resolutions for me seeing as im not the greatest at keeping them. This year i will face my fears and fight certain demons by being more open, and find love and stop looking for it in the wrong places, i will work my ass off. I will try to live my truth."

Perhaps i need to be more adventurous and step outside of the box of things i truly like in a guy... but then thats changing my standards... but perhaps my standards are what has kept me from being happy.. *sigh*.. two amazing guys... just not the ones i see myself with...  

i hate saying its but wen it comes to shit like this.."" What is a girl to do if shes still on it? ""  i think its cuz truly i dont want a relationship.. i do i really do.. but i can't handle it..its like foreign to me.. maybe the only way to see tho is to test the waters... but in all honesty.. its me not them...  I'm waiting to stop being hurt, and for love to just hurry up and find me... i can't wait much longer.."

Tears.
Remembering the little things and the big things of course too.

The "" well-adjusted fascade"" is forced on...

If i didn't love money i wouldnt work.

Its alot harder than it looks and way more different compared to go-carting and etc..It didnt help me one bit having my mother yelling and freaking out and my stupid ass brother in the back seat yelling and making comments and distracting me... stupid cow.. once they both calmed down i was able to calm down and improve...i can't wait till next weekend n i get to try again...im pretty hopeful

 im not as tired after work this weekend for w/e reason.. i did learn how to slack off the right way from stacyan..This weekend at work was actually bearable cuz i met Stacyan. Shes so funny and her facety attitude is hilarious my god she helps the time pass so quickly.. shes taught me how to lie and give me the 411 on managers so it all works to my benefit.. she hates her job soo much i hope to god thats not how i will feel in a couple months..but yea i dunno wut i woulda donew/o her. shes helped me to feel more comfortable at work despite being the youngest. i wish i could work with her everytime i get shifted. She looks so young n she married her ring is NYCE :0 Her husband is hot n drives a nice car..

 Newayz school is good; a bit monotonous but as long as its good it doesnt matter all that much.

Umm yea my mexico trip was great hmm where should i start
1. Beach, and food sucked ( mexican food is disgusting.. sure we all love the tacos and nachos but not the refried beans and everything that looks like mush.. and goddamn it, could i have gotten sum ice cream?
2. Weather was perfect (got a great tan)
3. Never seen more camel toe in my life.. those mexican women like their tight pants.
4. Went whale watching and snorkelling( saw humpback whales and dolphins it was beautiful..very surreal to see them in the natural)
5. I'm convinced every mexican man knows how to whistle..I was hit on in another language never been called mi amor and given ""the eyes"" and u kno that annoying mexican accent..( if ur curious ask and i'll demostrate in person) more in my entire life.. it leaves me to believe i look older than i actally am... or men and guys there are extra friendly... 
5. Went on a tour of the rainforest and Banderas Bay saw a natural waterfall and visited a place called the Kliff.. which was beautiful.. and sum other crap

7. Sadly, i didnt get to see any cock fighting or bull fighting..
8. Realized how much more grateful i should be and i shouldnt take my family for granted.. after that bus ride that broke my heart on Christmas eve..
9. Mexican sk8ters are hot.. ( not usualy one for sk8ters) BUT they were pretty damn sexy ( wish i knew spanish.. damn that language barrier)

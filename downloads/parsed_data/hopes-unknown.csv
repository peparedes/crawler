"event","sooo. last night i picked bailey up around 6:30. went to see napoleon dynamite. we got in the theater. and the guy came in a said, ""im sorry people, but we cannot find the reel"". umm. ok. only in bethel can the movie theater not find the movie that they have to play. he gave us all free passes to come back for free and gave us the option to go into another movie. so we went into The Notebook. it wasn't as sad as people said it was. i thought it was perfect. after that, we decided to see if we could see napoleon at 9. fortunately, they had found the movie so we went into the other theater. i bootlegged a few awesome scenes with my camera because it was only us and 2 other kids in the whole theater. it was a million times funnier the second time, if that is even possible. Brought bailey home around 11. said goodnight on her doorstep. <3"

"event","So. I haven't updated in awhile. I have been in Boston for the past week taking classes at Berklee College of Music.  It was sweet as usual. There is alot of stuff that went down in the past week. Here's how it went. One week ago today, August 14th, I went to Beach Day at Sebago Lake. It was fun, not as fun as past events though, I slowly feel as though I am getting older, and that is scary. So, after Beach Day, I went to Merediths house with Lela, Sam and Brian. Meredith's mom brought me to the bus station in Portland. Almost didn't make the bus. Got into South Station around 7. Darin picked me up and we went out to eat at Unos. I got a Supreme Pizza. . . w/out Sausage. And ended up with a pizza that only had cheese on it. NO SAUCE. so that was rad. Got back to the apartment. Next day, did my practice audition and hung around Berklee. Met some cools kids. Walked around the city at night. Next morning got my schedule and found that I had advanced to level 3 guitar player, which is the highest, oh yeah, I was super happy. soo. all week I had 3 classes a day, from 10-3:30. Highlights of the week. Went to Providence wednesday night to hang out with Elisse, Shea and Chelsea. Hung out at the Prov. Place mall. We saw an Imax movie and got water massages. oh yeaah. got back to Boston around 11:30. The next night was really nice, so I walked around and took pictures of the city. Went to the reflecting pool and listened to about 3 hours of Dashboard. I dont know why, but I did. The next day was the free John Mayer show at the Virgin Megastore. I got inline around 4:30. He played 5 acoustic songs and did a signing. It was awesome, and really crowded. I got some good pictures and video. Once I get home I'll put some up. Ummm. Next day was Friday. We had our final concert for the parents. My group played 3 tunes and sounded awesome. After that, packed up my stuff. Said goodbye to my parents who had driven to see the concert, they went home, but I decided to go to stay the night in Connecticut with Elisse and Shea. They were kinda dissapointed I didn't go with them, but they let me because they're awesome. So that brings me to last night in Connecticut. Elisse and I watched a bunch of movies, hung out in the hottub, swam in her pond and ate pickles on her balcony. Shea showed up around 10, and that's when the party started. So yea. today Elisse's mom brought me to the train station after we all played mini golf and hit at the driving range. haha. Got on the train. 20 minutes later we come to a screeching halt. A TREE HAD FALLEN ON THE TRACKS. It had been struck by lightning in the mad storm we just had. 3 HOURS LATER I ARRIVED IN BOSTON. 2 and half hours later than i should have. After 2 trains and a bus. AHHHHHHHH. That was a scene. I got in right as the last bus was leaving for Maine. So, I had to go back to my apartment which thankfully I still had keys to. I am extremely stressed out because I want to be home right now. roar. But, whatever, I'm safe, and had an amazing week with some awesome people. Can't wait to go to soccer this week. Should be fun. I miss summer already though. and it's not even over.

"event","So. I haven't updated in awhile. I have been busy with finishing up my room. I am happy now with the dark blue walls, and the cobblestone floor. It's pretty cool. All my stuff is back in and I am finally feeling normal again. Tomorrow I am leaving for Squam Lake in New Hampshire with my family for a few days. After that I am going to Rhode Island with my Dad to sell the jeep and I am going to get to spend some time with quality people. My summer has gone by really fast, and I feel like I haven't done much. I am going to cram alot into the last few weeks to make up for lost time. We are taking a bus back from Boston to Portland on thursday. Friday will be spent packing up for the next week. Saturday I will venture to Sebago Lake for Beach Day with the SYC! That will be awesome, I can't wait to see everyone. From Beach Day I will head back to yet again, Rhode Island. We will spend the night there where I can spend some more time with quality people. Wake up Sunday morning and drive into Boston. I will spend the next week in Boston for Berklee Guitar Sessions. Wooohooo. I am staying at my sister's boyfriends apartment. He's not gonna be there so, I'll be all alone.  Anyone willing to drive or bus to South Station, I would love to hang out with people in the afternoon after my classes. I am usually free from 2 o'clock till whenever. Warped tour might squeeze into that week if I decide to go with some friends from Massachusetts.  That week brings us to Friday where I will finally come back to Bethel. Then, I go to pre-season a week late, and I am a senior. After that, I begin school,  graduate, and go on to live the life I want to lead. 

ps. Updates will be scarce for the next few weeks. For obvious reasons that you just spent half an hour reading.

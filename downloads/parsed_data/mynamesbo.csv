"event","I forgot to go to church. grr. And it was Casey's last week. grr. AK. And, the going away party was tonight and I totally forgot till just now. grr. Other then that, today was pretty good, except I'm not all together healthy again, so I've been staying home alot. but thats ok, I like my mom. We just watch movies and do stuff together. Its actually pretty cool. *oh my life is lame*

::I wish somebody entertaining would get online::

Today was 8 year old day. I spent the day with a bunch of 8 year olds (that's where the name came from... duh.) Well, first I met my mom up at Macayo's and had lunch with her and Courtney. Then me and Courtney went to the mall and wandered around there a bit. (This is where the 8 year olds come in.) We went into Libby Lu's. *AAACKK ACK ACKKKK* sorry, just throwing up a little bit. ha no, it wasn't that bad of a store... if you are 8. But I'm not. So as soon as we finished talkin with Courtney's friend who works there, I darted for the door and hoped nobody saw me. Geeeze, that STORE. *shiver* Then we decided to keep up 8 year old day and went to see Sleep Over. It wasn't that bad of a movie... if you are 8. But I'm not. *DEJA VU!* hahaa. OH! We saw Pete too! fun.. then I came home and hung out with my mom.. she was workin on some spread sheet thing for work, and I offered to help (aww..) So we watched movies and I helped her work.. I'm getting paid for it too... don't worry! ha. I gotta kinda feel bad for my mom. My dads never home, always in California... I think its about time for California to drop off the US anyways... just get rid of it and let my daddy come home for more then a weekend. thanks. too-da-loo Cali! *muah* *evil laugh*"

Oh, but I did get an e-mail from Heather.. she's so sweet and I miss her bunches.

""and then there is michelle, mitch, perhaps it is your light heartedness that i 
love the most about you. weed wacking w/ golf clubs in the first 
hours of spring break, or letting the abs house know of amanda m. 
and her bladder control problem.  you are so supportive of 
everyone who is close to you and you have the skill of seeing both 
sides of any situation when others can only see their side.  there 
were so many times when you opened my eyes to points i would never 
have been able to see and i should have thanked you then but i was 
too stupid to, so thank you for always being the voice of the 
other side of any situation.  i know we had a rough time our 
freshman year & that was my fault and i am so sorry for that. and 
i love you too.  point being, i love you all and i consider you  
all my best friends and i just want things to be back to normal.

So back to today.. Celisha woke me up this morning with a beautiful rap she made up, naturally it was on my voicemail, *side note- Celisha messages are the best, she's always doin something funny like singing or rapping or something.. it makes me smile* went something like, Celisha got a car, yeah Celisha got a car... that was all I needed. So I called her back, and she drove over here (no license mind you.. she's gotta wait till they've got time to test her at the place, cause you know, she's 18 so she doesn't have to do the class stuff...) So, she came over here and we went and got gas... now THAT was funny. I came home, did a few necessary things, then managed $15 from my mom (dishwasher money and 'pizza' money) I rock. Then we went to the movies and saw The Terminal... pretty good, go see it, or wait till it comes out at the dollar theater.. and we went to Brios somethin somethin and I had this fabulous chicken.. what chicken is not fabulous, and some super rich desert. I love having a night out with fancy stuff and not having to pay for it! ha. OH! I almost completely forgot! Celisha called me while we were at dinner, and she was at the Rice Stadium with her family and they were watchin this Band thing, so when the Drumline came on, she called, and I listened... HOLY MOLY... I'm officially in love with college Drumlines, and according to her... they're all SUPER HOTTIES! lol Celisha's the bestest!! Well, it's almost 2 so I think I'm gonna go to bed. buh bye!"

"event","Wow.. so today was... um... yeah.

Let's see.. I got up super early and took my dad to the airport, I got home around 6 AM. and discovered there was a missed call. So I'm like... whaa? Yeah, it was Steven. 1:22 in the morning. crazy freak. So anyways, I went back to sleep at like 7 or 8ish that morning and slept till about 1PM. Then I decided that I should shower, and do my hair, just to see how long it'll take when school starts back up again.. *grr* school. right. So I did all the above mentioned plus a little extra and called Courtney who was job hunting. So I'm like, well I'm ready to do something. She's like no. So I remembered.. OH YEAHH.. Steven called. I think I'll see what that was all about. Nobody answered, so I'm like meh, whatever. So I argued with Courtney for a while about us doing something and she insisted on job hunting. Too bad for her cause I wanted to do something. Steven calls back and we decide that we're gonna meet up at Starbucks and work it out from there... yeah. Did I ever mention I'm not a coffee person? Well, I'm not. We hung out there for a while then went back to his house and watched SpongeBob Square Pants. Fun? yeah... there's more to that then I'm gonna say... but before I know it, it's like 7:30. So I'm like, yeah I guess I'll go now, and you can go eat. So this is what happened. I left and discovered there were like 10 missed calls, most from Courtney and one from Amanda. Courtney decides to text me too and tell me that my mom kept callin her and she was tired of making excuses for why I couldn't come to the phone and how she was never gonna cover for me again. I mean, cmon yall.. like I was gonna tell my mom that I'd decided to go hang out with Steven all day. yeah. right. anyways... turns out it was all a big joke Courtney decided to pull on me... to bad I didn't fall for it at all. Oh, Amanda was freaking out cause she thinks my mom found out about her going to Cali. to see Matt graduate. pshh, I say tell her the truth, she'll come to find out anyways. HA. How ironic is that? Yeah, Amanda can tell my mom the truth, but I refuse to. hahahaa. anyways, finally talked to Courtney, and we ended up at Bryan's and we watched The Secret Window... reminded me of A Beautiful Mind. Other then that, I liked it. Right. came home, now I'm talking to Josh online.. and he's more important then this thing. ha juust kidding!.. or AM I?! ahhahaha! I'll never tell!"

-Hello?
-Hello, is this Michelle's tonsil speaking?
-Yes. Is there a problem?
-Actually, there's a big problem. 
-What would that be?
-You.
-Me?
-Yes, you and your counterpart tonsil.
-Well, what have we done?
-Caused a disruption in Michelle's life.
-So what do you want us to do about it?
-Oh nothing, just be warned... you have a big chance of being removed from The Body, unless you can work together and stay invisible for a long time. We really don't need you anyways. But, for The Body's sake, we wish that you would stay, having to be rid of you two would put her in so much pain. 
-Oh. Well we can try.
-You better try hard. It takes 2 weeks for a complete tonsil recovery. We don't have two weeks, especially with Michelle's birthday coming up. And the Nickelback concert the ears have conveniently signed us up for. Let us not forget the camping trip Amanda has been thinking about hosting. You be nice. DO NOT STAY VISIBLE. YOU'RE NOT WANTED ANYMORE. It would be best if you just laid low for a while. Literally. Good bye.

"event","BBBBLLLLLLAAAAAAHHHHH... stupid stupid stupid sickness I've gotten myself into. blah. Anyways, all of today wasn't this bad.. actually today was pretty good. Church, we were firecrackers... fun fun fun, then I went to my grandpa's house and all his neighbors came over and we sat in his driveway and watched the local parade go by. That was pretty neeto... some float threw Ice Pops.. God bless them! So we're all hangin around there, do dah.. and friend of a friend of a friend's son comes over. Well... HELLO! Not bad if I do say so myself.. which I do. We hung out a little. By that time, Grandpa gets back from the parade, he had to drive some senator important blah guy around, and he's like cmon Michelle, you're drivin Bobby Jo. and I'm like... ummm the last time I even touched Bobby Jo was on my 15th birthday, that's almost exactly 2 years... are you sure? And he's like, get in. so I assume that he was sure. Soooo, I took Bobby Jo for about a 30 min. drive with him. Well, let me explain... Bobby Jo. One HOTT piece of work... no, seriously. She's a sparkling blue 1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass, for those of you who have nooo idea... google.com. Meh, I tried loading a picture of her on here.. but 1. I'm too tired and 2. I don't feel like messin with it now, maybe sometime when I'm really bored.

oh yeah. I almost forgot... my dad found the Nickelback cd. hmm... interesting. He didn't say anything, just put it in the cd player (my eyes got the size of quarters) and went straight to #3... it was kinda weird.. like he had listened to my Nickelback cd before... that's a scary thought, but I stole it back.. geeze, I was really terrified. Then again, we had been listening to Guns and Roses... there really isn't a point here, then again, there doesn't have to be.. this is MY journal, if anybody gets offended by it.. that's too bad, you should just not read this like the rest of the world... well then, I think it's time for bed, don't you?"

My dad convinced me that falling asleep in my bed for the night was better then falling asleep on the couch for a couple of hours and waking up, not going back to bed until some odd hour in the morning. Point being... worse bit of sleep I've ever had, I kept waking up and begging myself to sleep for another hour. Oh look, it's 5 now.. I keep paying attention to the tv instead of typing. Yesterday, umm I can't remember what happened yesterday. Today, however is July 4th.. yay to independence! We're gonna go to my grandpa's house, my daddy's dad. They act the exact same which is hilarious when they're together. I think we're gonna watch the parade from his house, prolly have some wonderful bar-bee-q. I think I'm gonna finish this movie up and go shower, get this day started!"

Anyways, nothing else happened yesterday... so far, nothing today either... although I did pick up my pictures from Juggernaut! saw Bethany and Tim, not much info there. came home, argued with Bryan for a long time about going to see the notebook... that didn't happen. Now I'm about to go outside and cook the steaks, don't worry, I've help. Maybe my life will brighten up later on today... maybe not. OH, Amanda made me a dilly page... then I went in there and fixed most of it.. http://www.thedilly.com/view.user.profile.wtd?id=340734

Tuesday:
At midnight, and Courtney, Bryan and I went to see Spider-man 2. Go see it. NOW. ha, oh it was sooooo good! My mom let me stay out till 3 Wednesday morning. That was AWESOME! Came home that morning and Danielle was over here. That was weird. She spend the night with Amanda, but it was still kinda weird. 

Wednesday:
Slept a bunch, I went and got myself sick again. Not fun. Got in a super fun fight with Courtney, it included throwing things on the wet ground and speeding off, and leaving seriously mean messages on her phone... felt good... then I started acting like myself again, and I felt bad. I love our fights, we're always just like, 'ok. I'm done being mad.' and tadum, fights over. Anyways... I actually got back online today, and got to talk to Josh for about 5 hours online, then another 2 on the phone... that was cool, I miss him. Speaking of missing... Steven IM'd me. I decided not to be all mean and pushy, so we had a semi-good conversation, but then I left to talk to Josh.. you know, it all works out in the end. So Wednesday was good, but I was retarded, and slept through Beach In The Box. Courtney sweetly told me I was an idiot for missing it cause Cheramy was there with little baby girl Mayfield, aka Addyson. Darn you Michelle, darn you. Anyways... that brings us to today:

Thursday:
It's 1:58 in the PM and I've got to remember to go to Mr. S's for the Bible study tonight... remember that Michelle. So till later on, when I might actually have something to say about today, buh bye!"

Also picked up the Xbox version of ""The Warriors"" game based off the movie. I've never seen the movie, but people rave about it. It was also made by Rockstar, and I like all their games so it should be a good play.

Also picked up F.E.A.R. for PC. I didn't notice it was DVD Rom version though. ; ; I need to go return it or pick up a DVD Rom drive (which I've been meaning to do)


Lol I don't even know why I bought these 2 games when the only thing I play is FFXI. Oh well =/"

Well I don't really feel like typing all that shit out again. But I've got nothing to do at work, so I might as well. I have literally nothing to do today at work. Nobody on AIM to chat with, all LS forums are kinda dead, most websites are blocked by websense at work, which I can't get around with proxy settings, because the techies disbaled them. Ah well, at least I can still get here. I don't mind getting paid $16 an hour for doing nothing, but when there is literally no work to do, makes things go a little slow during the day. Oh well. 

Hmm, in FFXI the past few week I've done a few things. Nothing too big or important, but just making FK stronger. Got WAR from 30-36 in 2 days. I'm actually shocked about this, since I was expecting to get a bunch of shitty Altepa/Citadel parties. I had 2 parties in 2 nights. Gained 3 levels each night, about 18k the first night, and 14k the second night. Tonight I'm hoping to get WAR to 37, and then I'll be done with that job for now. That'll be almost all my important SJ's done for RNG and BLM done.

RNG - 75   BLM - 73   NIN - 37   WAR - 37   WHM - 36   SMN - 35   

That should do it, I think. After WAR hits 37, I gotta find some BLMs to Manaburn with. I just need to get BLM to 75 and be done with it. I know of at least one other BLM 73 (Rha) that will do it. Now we just need a RDM and BRD. /tosssomethingatraggeh

Blah I had written so much more, but since deleting it, I'm not in the mood to type it all out again >:("

"event","So, after my few hours at work hating the thought of playing FFXI again when I got home... I ended up logging on at about 6:30. Started seeking on WAR to finally get it to 37. I gotta do it eventually ._. better to just get it over with. Besides, I want to see what RNG does with WAR sub and Fire Staff. No Utsusemi though... that's gonna be scary on things like Kiri~chan.

Anyway. I got an invite within 5 minutes of seeking on WAR, which I wasn't expecting at all. The party was actually amazing. For the 2.5 hours that we xp'd in Altepa, We gained about 18k in XP. I went from 30 - 33. I'm 2k till 34, which is friggin awesome. I can be done with WAR this week if I wanted. Too bad I only have Axe and Sword leveled though, G Axe and G Swd would be nice. Oh well. 3 more levels and it won't matter.

After I finish with WAR, I might just grit my teeth and get blm to 75 ASAP. Raggeh, let's exploit Sea while its still there >_< I can get to 75 in 3 nights (or less) if we MB in sea. After BLM is 75 and I have a decent enough buffer (10k or so) I will begin NIN finally. I've been waiting to start for a while now. I enjoyed playing on DB till lvl 41, and now I get to do it all over again /joy p_q

Last nights kind of party proved I still enjoy FFXI, at least when I am playing with competent people. Our party had literally no downtime, and the xp was just flowing in. If it was like that all the time, I wouldn't mind xp'ing, but sadly it isn't like that at all. Unless you get a static party. And those are really hard to run by. The one time I was in a static party as DRG it was great because we all knew how each other played, never any deaths and we always stuck to the same exact hours 6pm-10:15pm. The only shitty thing was when people had other things to do IRL or whatever, you can't xp that night because you don't want to get ahead of your group. Meh, whatever.

Shortly before signing off, Sib and Zae were talking about when they were coming back to NY in November, and Zae asked if they could come bug me! LoL At first I kinda laughed at the comment, but shortly after realized how cool that would really be. I've never met anyone from FFXI (my RL best friends dont count) so that'd be pretty sweet. Ingrid and James are both awesome people, and I'm sure we'll have a great time chillin together. I don't know about where she wants to go to dinner though. I don't mind having to dress up, I do it every day of my life anyway. What did you say that they specialized in serving? I was hoping for some Lobster or something =P I'm not eating any kind of crazy foods!

The only ""problem"" I can forsee about our get together is that it's probably on the busiest shopping weekend of the year. I absolutely *HATE* going out on the Friday after Thanksgiving due to the simple fact that people are out in force shopping like the world was going to end. I usually like taking the day off from work (this year we get it as a holiday) and laze around the house to avoid the masses. I've got the following Mondaythe 28th off as well, but I'd rather go out a Friday or Saturday, so if we get shit faced we've got ample recovery time. Maybe we could plan something for Friday or Saturday. Or both days! Whatever, its all good to me!

How would we all meet up? You COULD pick me up in Yonkers, since you probably know the area! =P Either that or I can take the train. Well, that's still over a month away, so there's plenty of time to plan ahead. 

I'm outtie. Back to work."

"event","Hmm. I haven't been here much lately. I've thought many times about writing, it just doesn't want to come out though. I like to be more of an observer than anything. I like to see what's going on with other people. Not necessarily talk about them with their problems, just like to see what's going on in their lives. 

Not much in the goings on in life as of late. After our little ""quarrel"" Steph and I are actually ""speaking"" again, if you can call it that. Should I say typing again, since we actually don't speak? Well etheir way, we are conversing with each other. Something still seems amiss though. I want to talk more, but I've been rather evasive as of late. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something feels strange. Maybe its just me, I don't know. I should just listen to what everyone else is saying, but I can't do that.

As a result, I'm just very lost with myself. I don't know what I want out of anything anymore. My life is just one big jumble of confusion, and I keep changing my mind about everything. It sucks too, to keep changing how I feel about something because it makes me look foolish. I think key factor number one is loneliness. I'm just sick of it. I've been by myself now for over 4 years. Even when seeing Melissa all those years ago, nothing serious was ever formed, but she was just a presence in my life that gave me comfort. I need that again. I'm driving myself crazy by being alone so much. I suppose to do that I would actually have to go out and meet new people, which sucks. I hate meeting new people. I pretty much dislike people in general, and then throw someone new into the mix...and bleh. With that attitude, it's no wonder I'm by myself, but hey whatever. I think getting/having a g/f would calm me down quite a lot... I'll be doing something about this soon, I hope.

I've been playing some other games now that I finally calmed down in playing FFXI. Recently its been Ninja Gaiden Black. I beat the regular game this weekend. I started playing the ""Mission"" mode they added. Those things are QUITE sick as far as difficulty. I've beat the first 17 missions so far. Pretty good accomplishment so far I think. Still another 37 to go, and I'm sure they get much harder then they already are, but I'm up for the challenge. Also been playing MK: Shaolin Monks and Indigo Prophecy. That game (if you can call it that) is amazing. Its more like an interactive movie. You make every decision for your characters in the game, and everything ripples. Not huge things, but they are definitely noticeable. The story is actually pretty intelligent too. If you liked Shenmue, get this game you will not regret it.

In the FFXI realm, I don't know where I stand either. I was logged on a good portion of the weekend and really didn't do much. Got RNG back to 75 after losing it. Beat AABC yesterday with 17x BLM and a RDM it was a random invite too. OMG that was amazing. 17x Thundaga III = dead everything except GK & EV. Blizzaga III finished them off. Supanomimi = GET. A couple BLM's in Eso beat it as well. Mayuka wanted to tag along as RNG, but it wasn't happening lol. I'm sick of the LS wiping to it, and just finally got it out of the way. So much for unity as a LS, lol/  Now I've got a 5k buffer which should alst a while. Last week sometime BLM finally hit 73. Weskit and Thundaga III are friggin sick. I love it, however I've had this really bad love/hate thing going on with FFXI. One day I say I'm so sick of it and say I am going to take a break, but the next day, or 2 days later there I am again playing. 

I don't know if I'm sick of xp, the game itself or whatever... but I need to figure out what I want to do with FFXI as well. I don't even know if I ""like"" the game anymore. I play for the sake of playing. I want to really lvl NIN to 75 as well, but by then I'll probly want to toss the game altogether.

I would probably better off just deleting all my characters, uninstalling FFXI, get rid of all weblinks and just sit it out a couple days and I can be back to normal in a week or so. That would be a monumental waste of time however. I still like most of the people in the game as well, and it would be a shame to see them go. If I did delete my char,  I don't know if I would give my items out or just throw everything out. This way I would have nothing to come back to, literally. That'd be a huge waste too though. All that RNG,BLM,DRG and NIN gear and time invested. I think I'd rather just give it to the real friends I have in that game though, not to some people who are just there in the hopes of you quitting so they can get rich off you. I know I won't delete it, it's just wishful thinking on my end. 

Guess thats it for now."

"event","Hmm. Past week has been busy as hell at work, so not much time to update. Well, between work and the game, that makes for 2 full time jobs. 

Wednesday 2 of my cousins came over to the apartment. My 11 year old cousin Brandon missed me apparently. He looks up to me for some reason. I don't know why. He's only 11 years old and the kid is so talented. He's a phenom with anything he touches. Any sport he plays at he excels in, to the point where he blows all the other kids out of the water and is the best on the team. He can draw extremely well, play music, and is a genius at school. Straight A's. It's awesome to see him being able to do all this stuff at such a young age, so it's really cool to have him as a cousin. But why he looks up to me, I don't know. Maybe cause I'm his older cousin. I don't think I'm one to look up to personally.

I kept him entertained with Dragonball Z shit the game and then put on an episode of it. After they left at around 8 pm, I logged into FFXI, where I was awaited for xp. Sadly we got the party together and well, it sucked. I bailed around 11 or so if I recall correctly. I felt like complete shit, plus the party just wasn't doing it. Only got around 5k xp or so. It was pretty shitty. Yesterday I got home and xp'd pretty much all night. I'm now only 6k till 70, and my enfeebling magic hit 200 last night, which is really good news, because we're supposed to be doing that 8-3 pot BCNM really soon, and that will help a great deal.

So far this week I've gained around 59,000 xp. I was level 66 last Friday, and if I get a halfway decent party, I'll hit 70 tonight. Thats pretty insane for me. I haven't leveled like this in a long ass time. BLM is fun as hell though.

I really want to get CoP done with, as we're so close it's really bugging me. I don't know which ring to pick now. I'm really loving BLM and I might pick Tamas' Ring, +5 INT, +5 MND, +30 MP. Thats pretty nice. But Raja's is also sweet. I'm pretty torn with which one I want. 
 

Anyway. She has come back from Florida. I got text msg'd the second she landed to let me know she got home safe. I felt better right away. It's funny, the first thing she did before unpacking was sign onto AIM and talk to me. She said she had an okay time for the most part, but only didn't like it because it was a new place full of people she didn't know. Still a bit wound up, and she needs a couple days down time in order to be normal again. Doing something every day, and then coming back to normal life and doing nothing is a big change of pace. 

She's also starting college next week too. She's really nervous about it, and I am too. I know she'll do well with school, because it is what she wants to do. I have the feeling more though she's going to have a hard time dealing with all the new people around her. She isn't much of a people person, except for her friends and family, so I think it'll be hard for her to adjust at first. It's kind of a scary thought too for me. I know she finds happiness in being alone, and not being tied down to anyone. Just yesterday she told me how she loves the fall, but it also hits her the hardest with her loneliness. If she is that lonely, then she /can/ do something about it. But she /can't/ Theres something stopping it. I need to figure out more pieces of this puzzle. 

My fear is that she'll find some guy in college and fall in love with him and I'll never hear from her again. I know the chances of that probably aren't all that likely. I know that's not what she's looking for. She isn't looking for a companion. But I just can't help but feel like something is going to happen. I tend to look at every situation, and then look at the worst possible outcomes for that given situation. This way when it happens I can't say I didn't expect it. Problem is, it usually hits that much harder because you know it was coming. People at work call me a realist, but if anything I'm a pessimist. They don't know me well enough to know that. 

It really is hard sometimes. We are nothing but friends, her & I. She knows that I want more than that, because I had told her long ago that I did. It also seemed what she wanted at the time, but something happened. She was going through a lot of personal shit at the time and wasn't sure what she wanted. I knew from the beginning though, that this relationship was not going to be easy to deal with at all times. I told her that I still would like to be friends, because she would take away everything if I couldn't accept her. Which I do. I really do accept her decision, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. So many things she shas said throw me off too. Women are really good with that. Well either that, or I just take things the entirely the wrong way, but I don't think so all the time. About the time when she said she hopes we can see the sunset after a rainfall together sitting under a tree together, or how if when she comes to NY to visit her sister we can meet and do something. It all feels like that will never happen.

It is okay to hope isn't it? Hope is something that keeps me going, not even necessarily meeting her. Just hope in general. She told me bluntly, she doesn't want me hoping that one day we will meet and everything will be ""Happily ever after"" I was told not to hope because she doesn't want anything to happen between us. I can tell her okay all I want, but i know deep down inside me that I am hoping for that. If there is one thing I cannot tell her it would be that. Because then I think she would go away forever. I don't know if I could handle that right now. She's the only thing that is stable in my life right now. I can almost count on talking to her every night for hours. Albeit on AIM, but hey its better than nothing.

Maybe that's why I found it strange to talk to Ingrid yesterday? Because I'm so used to talking to people online, and getting to know them online... that it's just strange to actually communicate in some sort of physical manner? I'm not sure. I'm just a very shy person really is all it comes down to I think. Especially when it comes to women. Just the hurt I've been through in the past, whenever I deal with someone new, it's just... hard. I really did enjoy talking to her yesterday on the phone, and she made me laugh a great deal. I dunno...I'm weird with things like that. Once I talk to a person a few times though, that all goes away, and I'm ""normal"" on the phone. I just prefer actual ""physical"" contact with a person where you have them in front of you. Thats not always a option though of course, especially with people you meet online.

I could go on forever here. Anyway. Need to get back to work. I have a 3 day weekend for Labor Day on Monday. I don't think I'll be leaving the house at all. It's going to be a beautiful weekend, but I just don't feel like going /anywhere/ I think I'd rather be by myself then around people when I'm like this anyway. My stepfather keeps asking me to go shooting with him upstate, but I just don't want to go. I /can't/ be bothered. I feel bad. I know I should do stuff with them, I can't.  I'm not.  My mom I think it really bothers though. I'm gonna be inside for 72 hours on a beautiful weekend, while they are out hiking, and I'm in my room, isolated away from the ""real"" world and in the game. Ah man, things are just such a mess right now. I'm so lost..."

Just when I don't think my day could get any worse, I have probably just laughed the hardest I ever have in the past few months. (which is a good thing)Me and In/grid were having a funny ass chat about her ""manly voice"" online and she demands my cell number, hahahaha. I knew what was coming my way. I picked up... and sure engough! There it was. Except not manly, haha <3 

Quite an amusing conversation, but short. Probly my fault, but hey all the way back to work I was laughing so hard, people were looking at me. Haha, thank you so much for a good laugh, you don't know how much that brightened up my day. 

It's weird though, as I was telling her over the phone to talk to someone is different than talking to them online. Lol I don't know what it is exactly, whether its just my shyness or what (which goes away quicly enough), but I just find it to be strange. (Don't let that stop you from calling me tho =)  ) I kinda hung up quickly, but I had my pizza was ready, so don't think I cut you off! ;_; lol. After I wolfed down my food I'm back at the office. I just walked in with a snapple, so it doesn't look like I got any food after I said ""I was going out for a walk""

Haha, I so paniced Ingrid it wasn't even funny! You heard me when I was talking to her... 

[Edit! corrections!]
cellmate: ""where are you going""
Me: ""..for..i dunno..i have to go...for a walk""
cellmate: ""a ..walk?""
Me: ""yes, a walk.""

Me: ""hahaha i gotta /go/""
cellmate: ""uh...um...ok...""
Me: ""I ..will get you something, ...if i get something""


Oh man, that was some funny shit.
Well, at least now I can confirm you don't have a manly voice. Though I will still pick on you for it! XD

"event","So last night I log into FFXI expecting to lvl my BLM with my 2 favorite lolrng's. They weren't on, so I waited around for a bit, got an invite from some party in Bibiki Bay. I hate being a replacement in parties. You get to xp for like an hour and then it breaks. Midway from choco'ing, I get a tell saying that the whm that was coming out is now leaving, and there's no other whm's out there. So At the sam time I get a tell from someone else leveling there, full party but their BLM dc'd. He's like ""I'll invite you, and if the other blm comes back, I'll just tell him oh well"" Fine, that works for me an invite is an invite. It was actually a really good party. In about 2 hours time of killing Dhalmels/Gobs(couple 10 breaks for dinner) We pulled in around 13,000 xp. 6.5 an hour isn't too bad IMO for the weeknight. Party setup wasn't anything monumental, but it was really solid, and had NO dowtime. NIN,BRD,RDM,DRK,RNG,BLM (me) Drk & Rng were sc'ing light, and there were no potential links in the area, so I got to MB Aeroga III. MB'd for over 1000. Quite sweet.

So much to my suprise after about an hour and 20 minutes, I ding to 69! YES! Firaga III GET! Holy shit, I just fell in love with BLM. After they did light, and I MB'd Firaga III for the first time... I did 1270 damage. @_@v  Watching a mobs HP drop from 50% to 25% is quite amusing. I WILL be a BLM now for a while coming. Fuck a rng (no offense...I'm a lvl75 rng myself) But BLM is fun as shit right now. I'n the past two days I've gotten 39,000 xp. That's a fuckin lot. I'll be going to get more tonight. Sib and Zae, SIU you two slackers! I'm already about 4k into 69.

In non related FFXI news...

She's due back from Florida I believe. She said the 20th to the 30th, so she should be coming back sometime today...just not sure when. It's actually been a quick 10 days. Although I do miss talking to her, so I'll be glad to see her on AIM tonight/tomorrow and see all what she did in Florida. It looks like she forgot what she said what she was gonna do while down there, but oh well nothing major. I'm sure she'll mention it. A little sad she forgot though. =/ When I text msg'd her the other day just to see if all was well because of the hurricane and all, she said she was and was also enjoying herself.Which I knew she would end up having a good time. I want to see what she enjoyed in Florida, the sights she thought were amazing, and what she thought about Disney. Funny she's 21 years old and hasn't been to Florida at all. I went there 4 times by the time I was 14. I just think that every kid, has always been to Florida at least once, and I'm kinda shocked when they say they haven't.

It'll be easier to talk to her now too, I used to stay signed off FFXI to talk to her during the week. I kept AIM open in the background while playing, and when she signed on and it was her alert, I'd sign off and talk to her. Sometimes it'd be in the middle of what I was doing, but I'd rather talk to her than play. But now that I have windower installed I can tab back and forth, so I can just as easily do both. I've been a little FFXI crazy lately, I guess just cause of a lack of anything else to do, so it'll be nice to have her back again. She recently made a new character after deleting her old one. I remember her saying she'd ""never come back, ever"" to the game after quitting. But she ended up coming back, which really did surprise me. I wish she'd just bring back her old character and rename it though, because then we could do stuff together again. Oh well.

I think in my life right now, shes the only ""stable"" thing I have aside from the game. We talk on a daily basis for hours on end. While its not over the phone, and it is online, its still something. I can understand why she wouldn't want to talk on the phone, those uncomfortable silences really can be brutal. ...And I have the feeling that would happen. A lot. Just because of our whole ""history"" I guess. All the things we know about each other. Or don't know. There's still so many things I need to find out about her. I want to figure her out in the *worst* way. (Not in a bad way, just want an understanding) I know this does not come overnight, nor in a few months. But its just something I want to do. I made a promise to her a long time ago, that no matter long it took I would do come to understand her. From what she told me, that was one of the most meaningful things someone has ever told her. I can't go back on that now, even when I think the worst thing sometimes. She would be /crushed/ if I were to suddenly blow her off for everything and disappear. I can't do that to a person, especially her.

We'll see what happens later. Hopefully when I'm lvling later on, I'll hear that alert...and we'll talk the rest of the night away."

After an exhausting week of work, all I wanted to do was relax all weekend and play FFXI. Well, that's what I did. We were supposed to do a lot of shit this weekend, but a lot of it got ruined by just either bad luck, or stupidity. Saturday morning started with us getting all the prep work for CoP mission 8-3 done. At least that shit is done with. No more running around in that stupid ass garden losing thousands upon thousands of xp. I lost around 8000 xp on my blm doing that shit. We didn't get the pot BCNM done. Everyone I asked said they only do it for their LS. Of course our LS doesn't have the right jobs nor the amount of people we need to do the BC. So it looks like I'm screwed till I get either:

A) Get a new Linkshell
B) Pay people to help
C) Do random shouting in Jeuno

Well, it looks like it might be coming to choice A. After speaking with one of my contacts this weekend, looks like I might end up being in one of the ""major 4"" by next week. More on that to come. Recap of the rest of the weekend first. After finally getting the Garden of Ru'hmet shit done, which took a little longer than it should have cause I misread the map on KI, we went over to Dragon's Aery to camp our friend Fafnir. I always love how when you have nothing to do Fafhogg pops in the first 2-4 windows...and then when you want to do something, he always pops in the last window. Well by the time it was the last window, there were over 130 people in Aery. Fafnir popped, I didn't even see it pop which really sucks, because I usually see it pop yellow. R0 got, whatever, more stuff they don't need. So that was 3 hours down the tubes. 

After that, we decided to go straight to the KS99 run. It's a good thing I suggested we do that straight from Aery, or else we would have been waiting forever. Sure we got the needed people to come out after 2 hours of waiting. Does that mean we won? NOPE. We did Orage's orb first, because he said he was donating it to the LS, so if anything went wrong it wasn't anyones orb. We do the first run, went pretty smoothly. Actually, I was shocked we won. Half the people that went have never fought Behemoth, let alone KB. Somewhat decent drops, nothing too notable. Next orb, mine. Okay... first of all, why the FUCK do you have on filters for your alliance you LOLSAM!? So when it starts casting meteor around you or someone else and then you SC, and get hate you make the alliance eat it. We ate at least 10 meteors. And that's being generous. No reason to lose that battle. It's EASY. CAKE. That just shows that nobody except a few in our group can LISTEN. Oh well, 99 Kindred's lost for me. Rha's orb next. Perfect run. Dropped a Kreigsbiel. Item I wanted for RNG, whole reason I was doing run. Why couldn't it go that smoothly all 4 times? Some thf's orb next. Who was it? I don't even remember. His run was worse than mine. How do you go from a perfect run to a horrid run? It's beyond me. I need to GTFO OUT! hahaha. Went to bed after that. 12 hours of playing.

After the horrid runs, I spoke to one of my contacts in another HNM LS, after telling him it was me on my other character. He was shocked, but it was good to let him know. Good friend. He said that they were looking to start a little recruiting. Since I already have sea access and Dynamis Xarc access, that it helps immensely. I need to play with people who KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. While they may not be as large or in force as the other 3 (r0, PO,PV) I would /not/ join r0 or PO. 90% of encounters with their members have been really bad encounters. To the point where I want nothing to do with them period. Granted, there are some exceptions to this, but still. I cannot be in a LS full of people with egos. There is nothing that pisses me off more. I have somewhat of an ego, and am a little bit of an elitist,but dealing with people like that, even if we're doing camping and stuff, I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself. Which leaves me with one choice. While they may not do as much as the other 3, I know at least 25  people have sea access, which is a huge thing for me right now, I want to see what it has to offer. They try Jorm, they do Dynamis as a closed LS, and can work DL down to 30% with about 35 people. On top of which all of their members are easy to get along with. I've never had a problem with one of them. That would be fine for me. I don't need something to do *every* day, as I'd like to level with some other jobs. I have to lvl BLM a few lvls this week anyway to get in the LS, so no biggie. I was looking for a break with RNG anyway.

Sunday morning. Woke up at 9:30. Goal for the day, to get as much xp as possible for blm. Got in a party at around 10:30. Sib woke up. I disbanded from pt. Level spread was completely fucked anyway. level 63-67 lvl range? WHAT IS THAT!? Oh man. So we got a pt in Boyhada Tree. After a horrible start and some massive ego trips (being from the LS's that I mentioned) we did a 180 and got a great amount of xp. After pt disbanded, Me, Sib, Zae... back to Jeuno and reformed again. Same pt setup. Awesome party. Then they had to leave for Dynamis. I couldn have gotten my level too :(  Oh well. As soon as I'm back in Jeuno by 8 PM EST, I get another Boyhada Tree party. That one sucked ass. Only got about 5k from that one. Goddamn RDM wouldn't refresh me. Quite annoying. Anyway, total xp gained for the day, 26,000. Not too shabby. 10k xp from 69. Nice. My contact was quite happy. 

The Main reason I want Sib and Zae to come with me, is because I don't want to lose them. I've been playing this game for 2 years now, and have a lot of good friends in it, but never in such a short time have I liked two people. They came from the server shift, started CoP mission with us, and I just liked them from the get go. People who join the other 2 LS's (PO,r0) Always usually end up abandoning everyone for that LS. That makes me sad, if that were to happen. I know they want to play with good players, and do a lot of shit, so I wouldn't deny them unhappiness by any means, it'd just be sad to lose them, and as much as people always say it wouldn't happen, 95% of the time it does. I hope everything works out for the last LS remaining... all 3 of us could get in together which I want. But I also wouldn't want anyone to be unhappy. It sucks. I think I'd still join them regardless, I just don't want to see my friends disappear.

I'd feel bad about leaving Eso, but it's just not for me there anymore. I've been there since April. I've seen little progress, while other shells (including the one I want to join) are blowing past us with everything. King Behemoths, Sea, Wyrms, everything. Oh well., Back off to work. Gonna be doing but nothing but straight xp'ing BLM all week to hopefully hit 70-71 by Friday-Saturday. No LS events, nothing. Just all BLM xp. 

Sorry about being a semi bad blm yesterday. I still need to readjust to hate control.  Overnukes  :(
I'm really getting it down pat now though. Didn't miss one MB yesterday in 3rd Tree party. Starting to come back."

My PS2 is on the fritz, it can't read discs half the time, and now my Xbox this morning decides it wants to break down on me too. WONDERFUL! This is my 3rd PS2, and 2nd Xbox. I think these systems were made to periodically break down every other year or so, forcing you to buy a new one. 

And my CoP partners in crime aren't on right now, I passed up 2 xp parties thusfar. I really hope they come on soon, or this is gonna be one bad day. I want to get this over with already :("

"event","Holy Crap. SE is probably the most evil gaming company around. After making you do allllll those missions and sticking together (CoP emphasizes on temwork) They make you run around The Garden of Ru'hmet to individual towers for your races. While I knew this was coming, I had no idea what a royal PITA it would be, and how many deaths were involved. Me, Sib, Zae & Rha all decided to go together, since it'd be only 2 towers to climb instead of 5. I didn't have all night, and I know others didn't either. Nobody seemed to have a problem. Except us. I think I died about 8 times, at least. I lost 6k XP on my BLM, which kinda sucks... there goes my Demons Cloak again D: 

I guess I can kinda see the teamwork thing here...helping your buddies out to make it to the top of each tower, but Archi's idea was good, Fleeing and then re-raising. We only got done with the first half of the mission done, we got our Lights back, now we need to go ocllect some other crap, which me, Sib and Zae are doing on Saturday morning. (dentist appoint is in Sept btw, not August) And then we're gonna try to tackle the BC. I know a bunch of ppl with Sea access, so I can hopefully get us a couple sleepers to help out. 

Quote of the night (and this shit had me laughing out loud)  ""Don't give me that Jap shit"" hahaha...
I found a plug-in for Windows IME that lets you type in JP characters even if you don't have JP client. It's pretty fun, but I won't use it around JP people too much till I have a better understanding of the keyboard setup, and characters as it could get me in some big trouble. Fun to use in LS & Party chat though :)

Poor Zae lost another 4 or 5k XP... dude is gonna be level 70 soon :(  we should just take low lvl jobs in there and run around not caring. It'd be kinda hard to RR then =/ Oh well, we'll get it done! CoP is almost done with!!!! Once I have that Raja's Ring, its Ninja all the way!

Dynamis Xarcabard again tonight. Hope we get some AF drops this time ; ; We got jipped last time with 0 AF drops. Maybe we can die to Dynamis Lord tonight! XD

I didn't get to puff my herb last night. Not that I had any, but I could have gotten some in the next room, but going through that Garden wasted...probably not the best of ideas. I should try and get some later today.

"event","The last few days have just been kind of a blur. I've spent the last 4 days secluded inside. I called out of work Monday & Tuesday just because I can't stand the place anymore. The people, the greediness of others, the overall job itself. I know most people don't like their jobs, but I downright loathe mine for the most part. I had serious contemplations of just going to work this morning, packing the few trinkets I have (Spawn figure, Satan from Legend figure, Yojimbo from FFX, my radio) and going home with it never to come back. I've thought about quitting before, but it has never been this... adamant? The whole way to work I was just thinking about potential consequences and positives from leaving my job. Everything from what people would think, (not co-workers, but people in my life) a source of income, future references, and a few other little things. Granted it'd be nice to have a month or two off, and get some things done that I've been meaning to get done, but I don't think it's a good decision. Actually it'd be a really bad decision.

I've been thinking of other things I could do to get out of this place. One of the most recurring thoughts is join the military. It'd get me into some great shape and pay around the same what I get paid now. I don't know if I'm cut out to join it, but one of my friends said he's interested as well, and I know you can do that whole ""buddy"" thing now where you join with a friend and get stationed together and all that shit. So that wouldn't make it too bad I suppose, but I'm still unsure. I'd get to see a lot of places I wouldn't normally see as well, which I would like. Seeing the world abroad, something I always wanted to do. With a fully automatic weapon at that, haha. I'd have to discuss that with a lot of key people first though. Aside from my family and friends... there's her. Which I'm sure she'd want no part of that for me. It all comes down to my decision in the end, but I have a feeling a number of people would rather not have me join.

Another (far less likely) option is to go back to school full time. I hate school more than anything (aside from my job) but with school, I would at least have my job as experience, plus some schooling behind it. That always looks better. But I would need a part time job in the mean time, which probably means working in retail again, but I promised myself that'd never happen again. I worked 6 years of it, that's more than enough for anybody. Besides, if I went to a retail store now, they'd probably say some shit like ""You're too overqualified to work here"" Office jobs are full time. So that's out. I don't know what I'd do for income. I also don't know if I could stand the thought of homework and studying again. 

In FFXI news... >_>  we did Dynamis-Xarcabard for the first time on Sunday. Damas and Tencteri were kind enough to lead it for us. It was pretty damn fun. Certainly the most fun I've had in the game for a while. We got 0 AF drops. LuckyStrikes unluckyness factor continues... but I learned a lot in there. I think I died and deleved about 4 times in there. I really need a buffer on my RNG so I don't delevel every time I die. Its getting *really* annoying. I should do an ENM or something.

I also got CoP missions 8-1 & 8-2 done last night. I think all of our people with sea access have this done now. 1/3 into the way of doing 8-2 I got into a really, really bad mood and didn't want to finish this at all. It wasn't even so much as people dying numerous times, and our WHM losing even MORE xp  :( as it was just my mood overall. There were 2 times where I almost used my warp and shut the game down for the night. But I didn't want to screw over a couple people I put this on hold for. That and her few words kept me going. Thanks BTW :) You helped me finish the mission. I would have definately left otherwise. Ended up laughing a few times too... the horror. Something about a Sonic Belt and a Phone Number? >_>  I'll be working on that Kraken Club too... hahahaha. We're supposed to do 8-3 later, but I've heard that can take hours upon hours cause you have to climb multiple towers. But we're almost there. Almost done with Sea. After I have my Raja's Ring, I'll be able to take a nice deep breath. I know a few ppl that may be able to help with the pot BCNM... so that's good at least. We lack sleepers.

I think tonight I might go home and for the first time in a long, LONG time, get high. Just to help get my mind off shit. I'm so emotionally unstable these past few days, I'm sure that'll be a good help. B/w that and FFXI should make for a good night."

"event","Being in a funk truely sucks. Especially when there is something you could do about it, but you just don't because you are so used it being one way, you couldn't think of having it any other way. That's how it's been lately. I don't know what exactly triggers the loneliness, or makes that feeling go away when it chooses to, but I'm getting mighty sick of it. I choose to be alone 90% of the time. I don't want to be bothered by individuals and their problems. As much as I hate to say it, I even feel this way about family often times. This weekend there was a good example... family BBQ... I wanted nothing to do with it, so I made up some crap that I wasn't feeling well so I didn't have to go, meanwhile I played FFXI all weekend. I'm a horrible cousin, nephew, godson, friend. Why did I choose to stay home? I don't know... I couldn't be bothered going out? Is that a valid excuse? I want to sit alone and not be bothered by any other people including my own flesh and blood? I don't know.

It's terrible that I consider people online better friends than most of those that I know in real life.

I can't say there's many people who ""get"" me. Even my own parents. They don't understand why I don't want to go hang out with friends on the weekends, or go out after work with co-workers. I can't be bothered by them. As stuck up as that may sound... I just want to be alone. But when I'm alone, while I'm content most of the time, I am more sad than any person could ever know. A lot of this probably stems down to my own fault, because I choose not to be in *anyones* company, and I could easily go out to a bar or something and be around people, but I think I'd be in a worse mood then. Antisocial personality disorder? Hmmm. 

There is one person that I do want to be with, but it seems rather impossible at the moment. I just want to go to her, hold her and be there forever with her, but it's not what she wants at the moment, so I just going on dealing with it. That, and the fact that she's 4 hours from me in another state. Not like I could just go up there and see her. She'd freak. People call me insane for trying to keep at an online relationship that they see to be going nowhere. Tell me to forget her and move onto somebody that you can actually see and talk to. Do I care what anyone has to say? No. While it's true her and I have decided to stay friends, other people's opinions about the subject don't really get to me. It did once, and once only... and that almost cost me everything, but I will not be dishonest with her, and she knows that.

It's funny when the person that knows the most about you is somebody that you met online, and have had no kind of physical contact with ever. But yet, I could not see being as open as I do with any other person. She still has me so intrigued. I want to know everything about her, I want to figure her out, I want to know her inside out. I promised her that. Am I being played for a fool? No, I don't think so. I want to have complete understanding of a person, that nobody else does. I can be read by her like an open book. She knows usually what I'm thinking, when I'm thinking it and knows when something is wrong. While I can usually do the same with her, its not on the same level. I'd like it to be someday. As much as I've said I hate the ""Guess what I'm thinking without me saying a word"" I like it. I want that challenge. Somebody who just gives you everything with no questions asked... that just leaves me unfulfilled, it's boring even. Something you work hard for is so much more rewarding than something that is just handed to you on a platter.

Could I carry that on forever? Just being friends with someone online & through text messages while everyone else passes me by, just so I could figure that one person out? I can see myself doing something like that... and I can say it doesn't bother me too much, but there's only so much loneliness a person can take before breaking. Even if it's just a warm body next to me for only 1 night, it's still better than having nothing at all. I just need something. Soon. At least then, I could be content for a little while. Maybe. ....I know what I want... but I don't know at the same time how to get it, or what I can do to further prevent any more hurt from coming into me. I just keep telling myself, in a few days I'll be talking to her online again, and everything will be okay. Shes safe at the moment, but I can feel as if she is uncomfortable in the place that she doesn't know surrounded by thousands of people she doen't know. 

....My thoughts are so jumbled right now, I'm going all over the place with this. I hate it. It turns my writing into a sloppy mess, going every which direction (as if it wasn't bad enough) I think I'll just go to sleep, where I don't need to worry about this kind of thing till I wake up again in the morning."

Picked up a Iced Blueberry coffee, and that hit the spot, woke me up and now I'm raring to go. I think that's how most Fridays work. 

Anyways... I did Dynamis Beaucedine last night for the first time. Run went perfectly. Zero wipes, but I died about 5 times. =_= Including one cast of Death (!) from Angra Mainyu. That was certainly entertaining. Who says RNG's were nerfed? Any time I did Slug Shot I got hammered by the mobs. We got 2 AF drops, Valor Breeches and... something else I don't remember. No RNG ;_; But we managed to kill off Angra and get out before his dragons came back. Ligro didn't get so lucky though. Poor guy might have even had to eat an R1 due to no WHM staying behind after he got booted. I now have Dynamis Xarcabard access, which I'm really excited to see on Sunday. I'm not expecting us to beat Dynamis Lord or anything, but I just wanna see some of the stuff it has to offer.

In other news, I'm an idiot, well kinda. I had a lvl 55 belt that I wanted HQ'd into a higher 65 belt, and it's a very risky synth, and not even that much of an upgrade. It's just more status than anything. Rha told me the sysnthesis ""_____ Belt, Dhalmel Leather, an earth Crystal, and a fucking moron to risk that shit"" I was dyin. Luckily I managed to find Ahobon and he gladly did the synth, but we were both cowering in fear the whole time. We did it on Darksday too, higher chance of failing ._. Luckily it was a success. And now I'm the proud owner of a _____ Belt. lol. 

In non related FFXI stuff... She is leaving for Florida tomorrow for 10 days. I wonder how that's gonna be. I know she'll probly end up having a good time aside from what she says, but I'll miss talkin to her that's for damn sure. She also said she'd let me know that she got there safely... But how do you let somebody know when you don't talk on the phone? That's gonna be interesting. Text message? Email? I don't know, but I'm gonna be nervous till I know she got there okay. Also wondering if she's gonna remember what she said she was gonna do down there. Ah well, we'll see I guess.

This weekends goal: Start lvling WAR sub finally, so I can get to lvling NIN, and reorganize my entire CD collection. I'm NOT looking forward to that, but usually when I start it even though it takes hours because I have TONS of CD's I usually end up enjoying it because I find some CD's I forgot about or thought I may have misplaced. I'm thinking the collection is now almost up to 850 CD's. Oh yea, they need to be in alphabetical order, and chronological order. Did I mention I was anal at all about my music? 

Peace for now"

"event","Just finished watching Sin City again. I remember this movie being really good back when I saw it in theaters, but after watching it again I really can say it's one of my favorite movies. Maybe even up in the top 10 list. Funny thing is, most people who saw this movie that I ask about it usually say 1 of 2 things:

Response A: ""I didn't get.""
Response B: ""It was too violent.""

Or maybe even a response C: ""I didn't get it, and it was too violent""

/sigh. People. If it's not an easy to comprehend piece of shit movie that cost bajillions to make and advertise for, people usually don't like it. Personally I don't think Sin City is that hard of a movie to follow. Others complain about things not being explained, certain characters just doing things for no reasons, etc. First off, it was based off a graphic novel (an extremely well done one at that) And the movie pretty much follows it down to the wire. Even the cast is perfect. Mickey Rourke's marv is my favorite character in the movie. I can't wait till Robert Rodriguez puts out the other 2 Sin City movies. I'll be one of the first in line to see it. 

I'm a fan of ""smart"" movies. Movies that leave you thinking about something when you finish watching it. Sure a popcorn flick is good, but give me something with depth any day of the week. I like having to watch movies repeatedly to catch little things I may not have noticed the first time around. Some of my favorites, in no particular order: Fight Club, 25th Hour, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, ALL Akira Kurosawa movies, Mystic River (need to finish watching it, haven't seen it all) Se7en (same deal) The original Matrix, and countless others.

All those movies are friggin great. I know a lot of people that like them, but if I try to have an intelligent conversation about Fight Club with someone, it usually digresses into ""Yea I love when so and so gets the shit kicked out of him"" The movie is *so* much more than that. Same thing with 25th Hour. Ed Norton is the man btw. Most people haven't even heard of that movie, let alone seen it. If you haven't seen it, and enjoy a really good ""talkative"" type movie that makes you think, check this out.

I guess I'm just trying to say people and their simple-mindedness really just gets to me. People, open up your minds and get past the action for once, and try and grasp the story like the writer/directer intended it to be perceived. I guess that would be putting too much thought into something, and the average sheep just doesn't think that way. OMG, EXPLOSIONS = TEH COOL!

I usually end up leaving the store with about 4 or 5 things, and having spent over $100. I have a compulsive spending habit. I see something I want and I buy it. I guess I'm lucky... I don't have any real bills aside from my credit cards, which I pay off every month, but it's all from buying a bunch of stuff I don't really need.

Today I walked out of the store with:

-Sin City :)
-Samurai 7 Vol. 1 Deluxe Box Set (1st release of anime) Came with a bonus of some really nice storyboards, and a really nice box. Not an artbox though =/
-Samurai Gun Vol. 1 w/box (So begins another box set)
-Varsity Blues (Since I bought Sin City I could get any other DVD in the store half price. I didn't feel like looking around, and I happen to like football movies, so it was only 5 bucks)
- Full Impact... (wtf!?) Again since I bought Sin City, they were giving all these no name movies for free. And I mean NO NAME. I never heard of a single one. It was free though, so I can't complain. Martial Arts looking movie. I'll probly end up tossing it.
-Sin City poster (another Sin City giveaway @_@) This is actually pretty nice, I think I'll hang this up later.

Ah well, those few minutes of sun at least made me feel a little better.

Excited today. One of the best movies of the year IMO finally coming out on DVD. Sin City. That movie was so well done. Everything. Artistic Direction, plot, characters.

Dinged to 68 BLM last night by soloing Spiders/Funguars in Boyahda Tree for an hour. 250 xp in an hour. Its so terrible. Then As I was walking past Gration, I saw one of their PLD's getting beat down, so I cured him a couple times. Gration starts casting Burst. Didn't see it, I took 1200 damage, and died. There goes my lvl. Luckily, Fallenhero being the nice guy he is came out to R3 me. That's what I get for trying to be nice. Oh well, kept their PLD alive a little longer, so it's all good. I felt bad for them, they only had 1 WHM and were eating a ton of R1's =/ 

Well back off to work for now."

"event","...Did you ever just wake up one day and wish you could go back to sleep forever? Today was definitely one of those days. I know people really don't usually like their jobs, and those few that do I consider really lucky... but I despise my job. Utterly hate it. For those that don't know, I am in the mortgage business. I'm not a broker. I work for a lender. So basically the brokers send us the loans, I process everything in it and close the loans. So while the brokers are out there *RAPING* the borrowers in fees, we're in the office dealing with pushy brokers and whiny title companies all day long. 

I don't know about anyone else, but I could not charge an elderly couple (read. 70+) Over $7000-8000 in closing fees. I don't know if its because I actually have a conscience, or that I'm not a complete money hungry fuck. I would never in my right mind do that. But yet I see it every day and it just sickens me. It's decent enough money for me, considering I don't have any kind of college degree, and only have a high school diploma, so I guess I'll just have to grin and bear the shit. It beats working some garbage retail job. I did that for 6 years. Never again will I go back. I'd rather be jobless for 3 months looking for an office job than working retail again.

I should become a broker...I'd be making a hell of a lot more money than I am now, but I'd probly get fired for not making the company any money. Oh well. Anyway...

I didn't feel like logging into FFXI this morning, but after a day like today, that's all I want to do. Hell even after the best days, all I want to do at the end of the day is log into FFXI. I don't know whether to look at it as really sad, or it's just my hobby that I like to do that eats up all my free time and sometimes makes me happy. People don't think it's normal that I spend that much time on a game, but that's another post entirely. More on this later. 

~Going to login =/"

"event","In violation of a thought a long, long time ago, 
Impressive reasons fill the cabins of my mind, 
No celebrations for the peoples that I didn't know 
Convicted even though there's nothing left to find, 

It's more than I can say, 
And there's a deeper part of me, 
Won't you be my inspiration? 
Help me end my desperation, now! 

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do. 
I've fallen to my knees, 
I've shed away my tears, 
And lost my destiny. 
I sit beneath the sun, 
My hands held to the sky. 
I cannot ask a question, 
But still I wonder why! 

Poetic Justice never seems to make the world feel right, 
Chaotic voices in the darkness call your name 
You turn away from me, whenever I remind you of the day, 
The sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain 

It's more than I can say,

My hands held to the sky. 
I cannot ask a question, 
But still I wonder why! 

There's so much pain, 
There's so much war, 
There's so much hurt, 
I can take no more, 
Won't you come and take me, 
To another day, yea 
Take me far away!

"event","All I wanted to do tonight was ding nin to 37, use my scroll of Utsusemi: Ni get a little buffer, and be done for the night. What happens? Get an invite, I suggest we go to Garliage Citadel, but no, everyone wants to go to Gustav Tunnel. Fine, don't listen to the only rank 10 in your party you rank 1-3 noobs. We go to Gustav, JP THF doesn't want to pull, finally he agrees. First mob went down easy. However, thats when things went wrong, JP THF keeps pulling w/o taking mages MP into mind. So, I die, whatever, get a raise, and we try again. I get dc'd this time. 

(Off note: My wireless router is a piece of shit)

Finally get back in, same thing happens. Except this time I Mijin Gakure while they escape themselves. At this point I don't even want to continue because they pissed me off so much. Then the leader goes... ""Lets go to Garliage Citadel...""  Yea thanks asshole. Maybe you'll listen next time. 

Oh well. At least the JP thief knew how to SA/TA off me -_-;

In other news... after tomorrow, I am officially on vacation from work for 9 days. Praise the lord. Work has become a pain in the ass now. Not going anywhere, saving money for a car, and other shit but I'll just be enjoying the time away from hell.

-Peace"

"event","Well, I had a LJ a few years back, but deleted and purged it. 

Mainly gonna be a FFXI based LJ, but will toss other random crap in here as well.

So I'm back as in FFXI after about a 2 month hiatus. I just needed a break for a while. Feels good to be back. More to come!"

"event","<B>I'm No Artist, I Can't Even Draw a Smile</B>

On a night where frost dogs bit me every other step
The streets were dusted with graphite and lead
Stop lights were palettes spilling glazed light onto clay cars
They were all begging for an artist 
With the gift to create what's in his mind
But I was just another sketchy figure 
With the ability to buy what I want as mine

Sooty children walked the streets like elves in a Christmas parade
When they saw my cloudy eyes I guess they feared the rain
Or the diamonds round my neck budding from a heart of coal
If only they had x-ray vision 
They'd see my brain was molded with pure gold
It tends to weigh down my conscience 
Like laying facedown nailed to a crucifix

And when they erect my cross like a somber monument
To commemorate such a wonderful person's visit here
I'll be looming above a hundred smiling faces and warm souls
That are holding onto each other, the only possessions they own

So I've had enough of this town, I think I'll just walk home
As my eyes rain needles and the frown stitches itself across my face 
I'll be in my mansion suffocating in rooms stifled with my belongings 
Looking down on the small happy town with a gun to my heavy head

.....Oh blessed butler won't you pull the trigger?"

Not like there's a gun to my head...
Cause I've been taking you for granted...
Yeah you'll be back like all the rest...
(Your calm and quiet and I'm impressed)

You're bathing in 4 leaf clovers...
With your hair covering the clothes you aren't in...
Your body is so flawless...This is a monument to your beauty...
And this is what it's like to feel rain when there's not a cloud in the sky...

Roses will never be as beautiful as you...
(But that's something we already knew)
Violets are blue and so are you...

On another rainy Monday
You put all of your feelings in that jar,
You thought I was sending it out to a rough sea,
To prove we could take on the storm.
Sealed it with a kiss, how romantic...

...I threw it off a building,
Oh you should've seen me laughing.
And I kept one piece as a trophy.

I played the leading role in this one,
I gave out hearts on the stage to whoever would take them.
They were all clones of my own.
You thought you were getting some kind of revenge
With all your uncomfortable infidelities.

You thought you broke it.
And in fact you ripped it to shreds,
But I only gave you a paper-mache imitation.

At the risk of being another cliched killer,
I slit your throat,
With an oddly familiar piece of glass I found in my pocket.
I didn't make a big deal about it.
You would have loved the attention too much.
Be thankful there's a red spot on the tile in rememberance of you.

By Sunday I stood, unsuspected at your wake,
And was appalled when I gazed at you, no...
It wasn't really that horrendous look on the face.
It was how even with death you couldn't...
You couldn't keep your mouth closed.
It took you three beers and twenty minutes to ruin everything.
Well, it took me one day to move on."

"event","So sing me anything sweet and soft,
A voice with smooth intentions.
The requiem for them and us,
A story of sorts, to tell of a past
with starlit melodies.

So bring the intricacy of breath on frost
With a moistened exhale of relentment.
The requiem of romance and lust,
A story of sorts, to tell of a past
of moonside tragedies.

Autumn nights have never been so cold,
At least where you are you're not alone...
Before long our hearts will beat in unison, as one, 
no longer seperated by the rise of tragic days.

So serenade me with a song of heaven,
Each golden note is ground for tears.
And though they don't provide much 
comfort now, they help me believe 
you're waiting for me there.

Autumn nights have never been so cold,
At least where you are you're not alone...
Before long our hearts will beat in unison, as one, 
no longer seperated by the rise of tragic days.

Soon enough we'll always be warm together,
Living and loving in a dream world in the stars...
Dismissing the scars of the past physical lives,
Basking in the light of heavenly ambiance.

Sing me your starlit melodies, 
I'll show you a moonside tragedy."

Breathe deeper, sweetheart,
The air is much tighter here.
Don't be disappointed when you
learn it's not the air that's changed, 
it's your lungs, they are collapsing.
But I'm not the killer, the silocosis is.

You say you never saw it coming?
Look into my face and say it again,
when I say ""it's over"" i hope you know i mean it.

Drink faster, my love.
The taste is irresistable.
Don't be ill-informed when you
learn it's not the sugar that's tasteful,
it's the reaction, the blood is lapsing.
But I'm not the killer, the liquid ebola is.

You say you never saw it coming?
Look into my barrel and say it again,
when I say ""it's over"" i know you know i mean it now.

Take it from someone who's been 
taking shots for far too long.
You won't be loading that mouth
with ammunition any more.
The tables have turned, I suppose
they might say.
""Her lungs are burned!"" I suppose
they will say.
Doctor, won't you make my day?
Take this girl to her precocious grave."

always there but never inside.. and you
keep spinning around on an axis of passion,
a passion to kill me and fashion the means.
(Wear my corpse like a fashion as if it means nothing)

And I'm the statement that sticks until 
your closest friends just try to catch on
to your emotional trend, and since it's only
me and I'm just oh so ""unique"", all of those
girls will take a turn with me. (My feeling means nothing)

And it's yet to be decided 
but the fog is thick tonight,
and all my talents and ambitions 
end in the dimming glow of dead headlights.
This tree will prove quite soothing
as I wrap my car around it, 'cause I 
know that it won't push me away 
like when I try the same with you.

Everything's backwards and this isn't 
the way things were as predetermined..
So call 119 in case nobody's listening,
and I'm praying that they can't save me.

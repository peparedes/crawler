<P>Everyone must check it out, because <EM>hello</EM>, I'M A CO-MOD!!!</P>
<P>Anyway.</P>
<P>Because I'm too lazy to make up my own description of the community, here, in the wise words of Kwen (creater of the comm and my co-mod), is what we're all about: <EM>It's a place for those who 'ship the delusional 'ships. In other words, a place for anything that doesn't fall under the category of canon. </EM>((She put that as an answer to the FAQ: What is Delusional?))</P>
<P>Presenting <lj user=""were_delusional"" />, a community for all things non-canon in the world of Harry Potter! We still love canon, though, without canon there'd be no fanon.</P>
<P>Please look at the FAQ in order to further educate yourself about the community; there's nothing I could possibly say that Kwen didn't already cover. Here's the link to the FAQ: <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/were_delusional/372.html"">Delusional FAQ</A>.</P>
<P>You know you all love Harry Potter, so you will love this community, especially if you love non-canon pairings like Harry/Hermione or Ron/Luna or even Harry/Basilisk (though we don't recommend it), or if you just like plain old non-canon things like alive!Sirius or pretty!Snape.</P>
<P>Come on. Jump on the bandwagon early. You'll have great seats :-D</P>"

"event","<P>NEW FANFICTION ARCHIVE ARRIVING AUGUST 2005:</P>
<P><STRONG>The Unknowable Room<BR>aka UnknowableRoom.org</STRONG></P>
<P>Just doing my own little part to promote it ^_^ I went around the site to find spiffy icons that some of the members made, and I will post them beneath an LJ cut (they will all be credited so if you decide to take one, credit them!).</P>
<P>Anyway.</P>
<P>If you haven't already been in it, check out <lj user=""thegreatbreak"" /> for news and information concerning UR.org. It will DEFINITELY be THE PLACE to archive your fanfiction once it's up and running. And I'm not just saying that. There will be <EM>amazing</EM> authors there, so you should definitely check it out.</P>
<P>UR.org started as The Great Break (hence the name of the LJ community) to refer to ""the great break"" from FanFiction.net because of their unfair treatment of their authors. To put it bluntly, they had major crap policies and rules and they were pissing a lot of authors off so we left. TGB is by no means a FF.Net bashing community - it just started because&nbsp;a lot of authors no longer felt safe at FF.Net. And know the community is beginning to evolve into a brand new archive, and I'm so excited and I think you all should be too :-P</P>
<P>If you've got an LJ, join the community and then check it out. If you don't have an LJ, then GET ONE! Kidding. I'll probably just make another post to say ""OMG SQUEEEEE UR.ORG IS ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVVVVVVVEEEEEEE!!!"" and then you can check out the site and be a part of the revolution ;-)</P>
<P>Just FYI, here's the site URL: <A href=""http://www.unknowableroom.org/"">http://www.unknowableroom.org/</A></P>
<P>Add it to your Favorites NOW!!!</P>
<P>Tehe.</P>
<P>Anyhoo. Icons! I took the ones I loved the most (which was a lot). If you'd like to see the others, go to <lj user=""thegreatbreak"" />. More icons are supposed to be coming out soon anyway. Come on, feel the fanfiction love :-D</P>

Those of you going to SBHS next year that read this LJ (Kaitlyn, you might be the only one), comment with your course selections! I want to know who I might end up with. I'm terrified of this upcoming school year, and for so many different reasons. Le sigh. Maybe, just maybe, the School Gods will actually smile upon me, just this once. Here's to optimism! Cheers! *glassclink*</P>
<P>Course Selections:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Study Hall (duh)</LI>
<LI>Honors English 11</LI>
<LI>Advanced Composition (semester)</LI>
<LI>World Literature (semester)</LI>
<LI>Photojournalism 2 (aka Yearbook 2 - Editor-In-Chief, HELL YES!)</LI>
<LI>Spanish 4</LI>
<LI>Discrete Math (semester)</LI>
<LI>Statistics &amp; Probability (semester)</LI>
<LI>Physics</LI>
<LI>US History (Academic, because it was really either EIC or AP, and I decided that in the long run, EIC was probably a better move)</LI></UL>
<P>Yay! Please, School Gods, have pity on me and be nice to me this year. I'll make an offering of #2 pencils and college-ruled paper, okay? Oh, fine, I'll throw in a ruler too. All right, is that enough? Good.</P>
<P>Good grief, it's only 7:45 and already it's obvious that I need to go to bed. Ugh. So tired...</P>
<P>And I just recently read Kaitlyn's post where she described the after-effects of the wisdom tooth surgery and I think I'll just have to run away. I cannot deal with pain of any kind, much less nausea! I can't do it. That's it. Can't. AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.</P>

<P>Gettysburg Yearbook Experience...what an...experience. I learned what it's like to be a sleepless zombie, how to be a proper editor-in-chief, that I will definitely <EM>never</EM> attend Gettysburg College, and that Andrea, Sarah, and Jenny are pretty cool chicks and we are going to make a kick-ass yearbook.</P>
<P>We left at 9:00 Sunday morning, arrived in Gettysburg at 10:30, discovered we were an hour and a half early, then went to a diner to eat because we were all starving. Good start, eh? It gets better.</P>
<P>Registration was a fairly interesting process. You had to go to several different tables in order to complete the process - at the first table, you submitted your emergency contact form; second table, you received your name tag; third table, you got your room key and dining card; fourth table, you could purchase tickets to the Herff Jones plant tour, the Battlefield Tour, or the ghost tour - we got ghost tour tickets; fifth table, you received your t-shirt; sixth table, you picked up your workshop notebook; and finally, at the seventh table, you turned in this little card that all the counselors at the various tables had hole-punched in order to show that you'd gone to them. Sounds fun, right? That wasn't the funnest part of our first day - not by a long shot.</P>
<P>The bus had dropped us off at the registration office and then left, so all of our luggage was with us. We were provided no transportation to our dormitories, so we all gathered our various luggage - poor Andrea had several small bags plus a friggin 20-pound fan that I offered to carry for her (big mistake) - and began the trek to our dorm, figuring it couldn't be that far away if we had to drag our HUGE and HEAVY suitcases there. Oh, were we wrong.</P>
<P>What felt like 50 miles later, in the absolutely <EM>sweltering</EM> heat, we were collapsed in the air-conditioned front hall of the dormitory building. Which was the <EM>only</EM> air-conditioned part of the building. </P>
<P>I don't think it was below 95 degrees the entire time we were in Gettysburg. Air-conditioning would have been appreciated.</P>
<P>Anyway. That was just the first day.</P>
<P>The second day, I was so sick I could think of nothing I'd like better than to just go home and cry. It was awful. And what made it even more awful than it initially was was that I <EM>really</EM> wanted to be able to go to my classes and everything - this was <EM>important</EM> to me, it was something I felt I could actually <EM>do</EM> (the yearbook, that is). I felt so defeated.</P>
<P>Finally, day three came, and the angels sang, ""HALLELUJAH!"" because I was all better and going to my classes and learning about yearbook and working with my co-editors to create a kick-ass yearbook cover and it was <EM>wonderful</EM>. I was so happy that I didn't have to go home and miss out on the whole thing.</P>
<P>Jenny and I were in the same class - Beginning Editor-In-Chief - and Andrea and Sarah were both in Advanced Editor-In-Chief. Nothing notable happened in class, except there was this strange kid named Robert (he went by Tito, though - I haven't a clue why) that kept trying to talk to us. Several times Jenny and I would start passing notes in class, and suddenly, he's start passing notes to us, and we'd just give each other a Look. It was irritating. He also kept bragging about his dorm parties, asking us why we weren't there (as if we were supposed to <EM>know</EM> that he was having one) and why we were never at the pool when he was there. That was reason enough to never go to the pool, so we didn't. Naner, naner, Tito, WE DON'T LIKE YOU. Giggle.</P>
<P>The lectures we had to attend weren't all that great except for the one on photography. The guy showed us all these cool pictures and taught us about the ""seven elements of photography"", then he showed us more pictures and asked us what we liked or hated about them, and he also asked us to point out ""elements"" and whether they were used correctly or incorrectly. It was pretty cool. Andrea, Sarah, Jenny and I ended up walking around campus afterwards and Andrea asked me to take some pictures and I kept annoying them by pointing out ""elements"" and acting like I was really excited about how those branches worked as a framing device, or how that railing served as a leading line. We were all cracking up. It was a lot of fun.</P>
<P>Say hello to one of your new editors, Kaitlyn :-P I'll try to be nice to you. Hehehe.</P>
<P>This year's yearbook is going to be awesome. Just you wait and see. You will be amazed.</P>"

<P>Ok, seriously. BEST. LIVEJOURNAL. EVER.</P>
<P>Everyone go here: <lj user=""iharthdarth"" /> </P>
<P>So funny. It is pure genius. Pure comedy genius, that is. </P>
<P>In case you're wondering what it is, exactly, it's a comic series of Star Wars all about (who else?) Darth. And they are SO FUNNY. Here's&nbsp;two samples, one with Luke and one with Leia: <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/iharthdarth/4989.html#cutid1"">BANDAIDS</A>&nbsp;and <A href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/iharthdarth/7382.html#cutid1"">DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL</A>.</P>
<P>Now, GO READ THE REST OF THEM. </P>
<P>And now I need to go sleep because I have to get up early tomorrow. Call me on Friday!</P>

<P>I have joined the <lj user=""omg_harrypotter"" /> livejournal roleplaying game! Tehehe. It's very amusing. Unfortunately, by the time I found it, a lot of the characters had already been taken. But, the character I have isn't too bad, considering she's so absolutely horrible that it's hard not to like her to some small degree: Rita Skeeter. Ooooh, this is going to be such fun! *dreamy-eyed look* I can already see all of the reputations I shall butcher as a journalist...</P>
<P>Anyway, the plot behind <lj user=""omg_harrypotter"" /> is...actually kinda plotless, but basically there is the original canon characters and then CLONES of all the characters, IC! being the original characters and OOC! being the clones. I'm IC!Rita Skeeter because I couldn't really see any point in being OOC! - she's an amusing character to play either way. The reason there are clones is because of something gone horribly wrong...and it's all Voldemort's fault (though I'm not sure what it is, and also not sure if I'm <EM>supposed</EM> to know what it is...ah well. When I eventually get around to reading all of the LJs, perhaps I'll uncover more about the RP...).</P>
<P>If you really want to see my Rita Skeeter livejournal, you can check it out here:<lj user=""quick_quotes"" />. I highly recommend going to the User Info so that you can check out the other characters' journals - some are really freakin' hilarious.</P>
<P>Okay, well I just wanted to share my joy and amusement :-D</P>
<P>Ta, luvs!</P>"

"event","<P>I just got home from Pennsylvania about an hour ago. The house - well, condo - is pretty nice. I have totally claimed the room with the balcony. It rained today and I sat on the balcony, just watching the rain pour down. It brought me a strange sense of peace. Which was broken every time the neighbors came or left their condo - CJ didn't grasp the situation and thought that&nbsp;every time a&nbsp;garage door opened,&nbsp;it was Mom and Dad and Jessi. Which it wasn't.</P>
<P>Mom and Dad are still in Pennsylvania - they're going furniture shopping and will be home on Saturday. So party at the Michi Boo's ;-)</P>
<P>Except right now I'm very depressed, in that heart-clenching way where everything just seems so pointless, even though I keep telling myself that it's not and that someday, things will look up. </P>
<P>But I don't believe myself. Not in the least.</P>
<P>Jessi and I drove back by ourselves, music playing as I navigated our way out of Pennsylvania. Jessi received a phone call from her friend, so she chatted with him as she drove down I-70. I mostly tuned out the conversation, but then I heard her say ""Andy"" and ""break up"" in the same sentence so I got kinda worried and tuned back in.</P>
<P>The gist of it is that she and Andrew (the friend on the phone) had been talking about what was going to happen now that they were all going off to different colleges, and she simply said that she and Andy had talked about it as soon as they'd started dating and they'd decided to break it off once they went to college. She said that she didn't want either of them to feel obligated or tied down, so it was just better off that way. I just thought, <EM>How depressing</EM>. Honestly, she knew from the beginning that their relationship was basically doomed. She kept saying that they'll still be friends, at least they're ending on a good note, they'll be eight hours apart so it'd be hard to do otherwise, but...I don't know. Now I'm just thinking of what will happen to all of us in two years. We'll all be going through the same kind of thing - saying goodbye to each other, because what are the chances of any of us picking the same college? It just makes me feel so helpless. I already had to say goodbye to so many people this year, and soon I'll have to say goodbye to my sister and my father, though he'll be back every week for about three days or so before he has to go back to PA. Now I'll have so many more goodbyes to say in two years. Can I do it? I don't feel like I can. I don't want to say goodbye anymore. I hate it.</P>
<P>Anyway. Back to the car.</P>
<P>Jessi finally hung up with Andrew and, coincidentally, the CD we currently had playing ended. So she put in Yellowcard and put on the little ""random"" feature, and the first song to play is Miles Apart. We both started to sing along, but Jessi sang louder, and I could swear I heard her voice breaking just the slightest bit. <EM>We'll be miles apart, I'll keep you deep inside, you're always in my heart</EM>. I could tell she was thinking about Andy. I wanted to cry. I did, just the tiniest bit, when she sang, ""<EM>I'd give it up for just one more day with you, give it up, give it all away</EM>."" Andy is her first boyfriend, and they have been dating since January 15th (wow - tomorrow is their six month anniversary o_O). I can't even imagine how much this must be tearing her apart. Yeah, she knew since the beginning that there was going to be an ending, but that really can't help things at all. Perhaps it's even making it worse. And having to say goodbye to all her other friends too...it really breaks my heart to think about it.</P>
<P>I was so wrapped up in my thoughts I didn't even notice the song change. But then I heard the words ""Ocean Avenue"" and I just about had a complete breakdown. I was already mourning Jessi's love life, why must I be forced to mourn my nonexistant one? I tried to think of it as just another song, but before I could stop myself, I was thinking of a time not so long ago in the gym at school, where Ocean Avenue was playing in the background and my heart was fluttering wildly. </P>
<P>Damn him for even pointing out the song. If he hadn't, I would probably never make the connection between the song and that moment. Then I wouldn't have had to feel so horrible the rest of the way home.</P>
<P>Now I have the song playing continually on my computer. </P>
<P>Why do I do this to myself?</P>
<P>Because, as I've said many times before, I'm very good at hurting myself. I think I'm secretly a masochist.</P>
<P>Since I can't stop them, I'm just going to allow myself to indulge in the memories. I will remember. No matter how much it hurts. I don't know why, but I feel like I need to do this. </P>
<P><EM>I'm falling into memories of you...</EM></P>"

You are unique, creative, and expressive.
You don't mind waving your freak flag every once and a while.
And lucky for you, most people find your weird ways charming!</font></td></tr></table>

<P>I <EM>promised</EM> myself that as soon as vacation started, I would write. There were so many times during the school year that I wanted to just sit down and write, but I wasn't able to and so I promised myself that come summer, I would finally start up on my writing again. I've really missed writing. Writing is my passion. But now I've just gone through all of my emails and most of them were from Fanfiction.Net and I feel horrible because I hadn't even given a thought to writing since school ended. I broke my promise to myself. I need to fix that.</P>
<P>So now I'm going to go through all of the writing files on my computer, look through all of the random notes I jotted down in various notebooks during the year, and I'm going to write. Even if it's just a few paragraphs for another chapter in one of my fanfictions. I just need to write. The more I write, the more I learn about my own writing style. I need to do that - find my voice and then work with it. My writing is always so haphazard - sometimes it's deep and eloquent, other times it's witty and humorous. Kind of like my LiveJournal. I need to make my stories flow better. I'll work on that during the summer. Who knows - maybe I'll even be able to think up a really good plot, something I can really work with, and then I'll finally be able to start working on the novel I've been desperate to begin.</P>
<P>My passion for writing has been renewed. I'm anxious to see where it will all lead. Maybe, finally, I'll write something I can be proud of. Until then, I will let my mind be free, and I shall see what comes of it.</P>
<P>Wish me luck.</P>"

<P>And I apologize ahead of time for skewed sizing. Photobucket sucks and I need a new pic server, but this will have to do for now. Some are too big, some are too small. I attempted to fix them, but after a while I just gave up. Too much effort, you know?</P>

<P>So I was at Plyrics.com because I was planning to look up the lyrics of a Dashboard Confessional song because someone (can't remember who) had some of the lyrics to a song (don't know which one) in their profile, and it seemed familiar so I was going to figure out which song it was when I accidentally clicked on some band called Daphne Loves Derby. I had not yet realized my mistake when I randomly clicked on a song title - ""Hopeless Love"" - and that's when I finally realized, Hey, this isn't Dashboard Confessional. But the lyrics were really...deep, so being as bored as I was, I looked up the song online, found it, listened to it, and fell in love with Daphne Loves Derby. And now I have a PureVolume thingy up and I'm listening to random DLD songs. And they are awesome. I am already making plans to drag my parents to Best Buy so I can get their CD.</P>

<LI>See my friends as much as possible because I love them dearly and most of them are going to Briar Woods next year so I have to get in as much ""seeing them"" time as possible before the school year starts up again and we all get bogged down because knowing our luck, we'll all have sadistic teachers and will never, ever see each other again</LI>
<LI>HOPEFULLY see my FAVORITEST Nikaroo in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD because I will die if I don't see her again soon (EMAIL ME you major poo - I haven't gotten an email from you in, like, two-and-a-half weeks, and that is just too damn long)</LI>
<LI>Just have an all-around grand summer to make up for the all-around crap school year</LI></UL>"

"event","<P>LAST DAY OF SCHOOL, BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>Of course, summer vacation was ruined for me the minute I got into the car and my dad said, ""You have to clean up the poops as soon as we get home."" Yes, thank you, Dad. So tactful. Summer vacation is sure to be grand when the first minute of it has been ruined due to Poop Duty. Cheers.</P>
<P>Anyway. Exams are finally over. I think I did fairly well on all of them. I officially love Dr. Mandes because of what he wrote in my yearbook. Leaving for a cruise next Sunday. Life is pretty okay.</P>
<P>Except I just went to Jessi's graduation ceremony.</P>
<P>Suddenly - BOOM!!! It hits me. She's not going to be here next year. I'm going to be all only-child-like.</P>
<P>It's very upsetting and it shouldn't be because I'm supposed to be thinking all the happy thoughts of taking over her walk-in closet and getting to use the basement without having to worry about her and her friends using it and stuff like that. Instead I'm thinking of the few times this year we actually treated each other like human beings and I'm wishing she didn't have to go because I liked those moments and I feel like we have more the older we get (who knew? We actually <EM>can</EM> mature!) and we're understanding each other more and just...yeah. I'm going to miss her. A lot.</P>
<P>So many people will be missing next year. There will be empty spaces. Too many. I dread next year.</P>
<P>Anyway. After school, I got dressed up all prettily and then me, Mom, Dad, Jessi, Grandma, Nona, Aunt Karyn, Gramps, Uncle Bill, and Andy piled into three separate cars and drove to a restaurant called Brion's Grille where we met Mr. and Mrs. Wujick and we ate and talked and obsessed over my new camera - </P>
<P>WAIT!!! Pause, rewind, start over. I GOT A NEW CAMERA!!! (and now back to our regularly scheduled program)</P>
<P>Afterwards, we drove to the Patriot Center in order to take pictures of Jessi in her gown before she had to go inside (we got there about an hour and a half early - blegh). Mom made her pose with everyone, and at first I laughed at her and just played with my camera, taking lots of pictures in all different colors and styles, and then I was dragged into the photo shoot. Then I took more pictures, and then Jessi stole the camera and began taking pictures of herself, with the scariest faces you've ever seen. She dragged poor Andy into it, too. I'll post up pics as soon as I load them onto my computer. They're great. I'll just have to make sure Jessi never finds out that I put them on here (hehehe).</P>
<P>The actual graduation ceremony was fairly boring - lots of speeches that didn't pertain to me. But the band played very well (though why they did <EM>Independence Day Highlights</EM> is beyond me - music from a movie about aliens for a graduation ceremony? I think I missed something here...) and the chorus sang beautimously and Thao Ngo and Stephanie Copperman have absolutely beautiful voices and they sang ""For Good"" from <EM>Wicked</EM>. </P>
<P>When Jessi went up to get her diploma, I shouted, ""<EM>Way to go, Jessi!</EM>"" just to annoy her, but I don't think she heard me over the cheering of Mom, Dad, Grandma, Nona, Aunt Karyn, Gramps, Uncle Bill, Mr. Wujick, Mrs. Wujick, Auntie Ei, Al, and Andy.</P>
<P>Now Jessi's at Project Graduation along with Mom and Dad (they go every year to take pictures so that at the end of the night, they can show all the seniors a slide show, which they plan on replaying at the 10-year reunion) and it is 2:04 AM and I am tired.</P>
<P>Julie and I are speaking again. It was a very long, complicated conversation but in the end, we managed to settle a lot of things that had been blown out of proportion, so I think we're going to be okay now. She recommended two books to me before she signed offline. Glad to have you back, Julie.</P>
<P>And now, good night one and all. It has been a hell of a long day. I'm sleeping in tomorrow.</P>
<P><EM>Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in...</EM></P>"

"event","<P>Some people just think too highly of themselves.</P>
<P>The English exam was really easy, but when I got to the last essay, two of my <EM>favorite</EM> people *cough* *cough* started talking and would <EM>not shut up</EM>. I mean, <EM>God</EM>, how inconsiderate and just plain stupid do you have to be to talk so much and so <EM>loudly</EM> when people are taking an exam??? Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was common courtesy to shut the fuck up when people are testing - especially for something that counts as such a huge chunk of your final grade. Several times I almost said to them, ""Erm, yeah, hello? See me over here, pencil in hand, with my exam booklet open? That means I'm still <EM>testing</EM>. So be quiet."" Bitches. (Just kidding.) Honestly, though. Have we not all been learning since we first started testing that from the time the test booklets are passed out to the time when they are all turned in, you are not supposed to talk??? Geez. Our generation really does get dumber and dumber.</P>
<P>Someone else thought too highly of herself today, too.</P>
<P>After the exam, I was walking toward the front of the school so I could sign out since I just had Study Hall, but I saw some friends so I went to talk to them. Then I saw Megan, so I went to ask her a quick question about the Health exam since she had just taken it (I couldn't remember if it was open note or not) and Bekki was standing there, but then she left. So Megan and I chatted a bit and then she had to go somewhere so I turned to go sign out when suddenly Julie appears and says, ""Yeah, we've kinda gotta decide if we're friends or not because I want my books back.""</P>
<P>There are so many things wrong with that sentence, I have no idea where to begin.</P>
<P>I suppose I'll start with <EM>WE??????????</EM> <EM>Earth to Julie, Earth to Julie: there is no WE. There is a YOU who decided to no longer be friends with ME. There is no WE that decided not to be friends anymore. So please, use correct English. You may confuse people.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Secondly, oh, so it's ok to talk to me when Bekki's not around and when books are your concern? Oh yes, that really makes me want to be nice and actually give you your books back. I wonder why I have a sudden urge to burn them all...</EM></P>
<P><EM>And no, my books really aren't a concern to me. I don't even remember which ones you have. You've had them so long you might as well just keep them, as they're practically yours anyway. I mean geez, I didn't even get to start reading one of the books you bought for me before you took it back to your house to read. So I think I can live without them. If I really want them, I'll just buy them again. No big deal. I've got a job now, so I can pay for them.</EM></P>
<P><EM>And people aren't friends merely because of books. Perhaps you were unaware of it, but there is a lot more to friendships than books.</EM> </P>
<P>I'm very pissed off right now. I just needed to vent. I'm going to go massacre my pillow now. I'm not in a very ""people"" mood right now.</P>
<P>Bye.</P>"

"event","<P>Ok, so I'm supposed to be studying right now, but since when do I ever do what I'm supposed to do? </P>
<P>Besides, I'm going to die tomorrow, as I've got my math and AP exams then, so I really don't think updating in here for the last time will really affect my studying all that much, now will it?</P>
<P>So. Friday and Saturday I was not here, as some of you may have noticed. I was in Radford, watching Sister Dearest slide tackle soccer balls all over the Patrick D. Cupp (hahahahahahahahaha) Memorial Stadium. I got to take lots of pictures, so I was happy. Ho hum. Such fun.</P>
<P>And OMG Whose Line Is It Anyway is the BEST. SHOW. EVER. I love it. I am so marrying Wayne Brady one of these days. You know, after he divorces his current wife because he has realized his love for me. :-D I know, I'm so silly. Silly, silly me. Anyway. Last time I watched Whose Line, it was the episode where Ryan&nbsp;has to play&nbsp;Carol Channing (or whatever her name is) in Party Quirks, and his main ""quirk"" is that his head sticks to random objects. He ended up smashing the little light on Drew Carey's desk when he zoomed over towards it. It was sooo funny. He kept asking people if he was bleeding. Haha. And then the one that followed was the ""Let's make an h!"" one. Oh wow. That one brings back memories...</P>
<P>And not all good ones. Some are greatly disturbing, and I shall now have trouble sleeping tonight due to severe emotional scarring.</P>
<P>Hmmm. What else can I ramble on about?</P>
<P>Kaitlyn and I stalked Stockman today and we giggled like little schoolgirls as we walked down the hall with our arms over one another's shoulders. It was fun. Kaitlyn, I will stalk with you anytime :-D</P>
<P>Little Johnny is here right now. He's so cute. My mom asked him what he wanted for his birthday and he gave her this long list of Thomas the Tank Engine trains that he wanted, and he also listed different animals that he wanted, including a hippopotamus, an ostrich, and a mommy and daddy polar bear. Awww...</P>
<P>Ho hum.</P>
<P>I should probably actually study now. El madre is sure to sneak up on me soon and start screaming her head off that I'm going to fail if I don't start studying RIGHT THIS MINUTE. As if I need her to tell me that. Pfft. </P>
<P>Toodles. Nicole, email me soon. I really want to see you this summer.</P>

"event","<P>Ok. Now that I am all dry and smell April fresh (I never really understood that phrase - April really doesn't smell fresh, does it? It smells kind of...wet) I can finally update this thing and attempt to make up for my radio silence for however many days it's been. I had many people at school coming up to me and asking me if I'd died over the weekend (to which I always replied, ""Yes,"" just to show them how ridiculous they were being - kidding, it was all said jokingly) so I thought it was about time that I updated here so the world would know that MICHI BOO LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>*ahem*</P>
<P>The reason for my radio silence was that I was <EM>uberly</EM> sick. I mean <EM>UBERLY</EM>. It was awful. On Friday, I really did think I was dying. I couldn't eat anything and my head my throbbing and my stomach was actually in <EM>pain</EM> - it felt like I'd been socked in the gut. And doctors really are the most useless things in the world - my mom took me to the doctor on Friday (I think it was Friday...) and I described all my symptoms to him and then he did that breathing thing and poked around my abdomen a bit (I was ready to <EM>kill</EM> him - I had already told him I was in pain, and there he was putting PRESSURE on it!) and said, ""Well, it might be appendicitis..."" (I'm too lazy to see if that word is spelled correctly) and then he said he was going to run a blood test just to be sure and told my mom that if the pain got worse I was to be taken straight to the emergency room and then he prescribed some more of the medicine I was already taking that wasn't helping, mostly because I could only take it right before bed and when I'm sleeping, it doesn't really matter if I'm in pain or not, does it? Anyway, the doctor never took the blood test and instead walked us up to the desk and handed my mom the prescription, which she never bothered to get, and then he said, ""Have a nice day!""</P>
<P>The sadistic little bastard.</P>
<P>I say that to people who come shopping at Hallmark. That is NOT what you say to people that are in pain and that you gave no help WHATSOEVER to.</P>
<P>I'm glad Jessi decided to not be a doctor. I'd have to kill her when I go on my homicidal rampage later in life.</P>
<P>So I was out of school on Thursday and Friday, stayed in bed for basically the entire weekend, was also out of school on Monday, managed to keep down an entire banana nut muffin, at which point my mom declared I was finally getting better, and then I woke up today feeling a hell of a lot better, which is good, because even if I <EM>hadn't</EM> been feeling better I probably still would have dragged myself to school just so I wouldn't have to miss Field Day.</P>
<P>Yes...the glory of Field Day.</P>
<P>At first, it wasn't so glorious because we Lowly Sophomores had to be cooped up in homeroom and were forced to watch <EM>Happy Gilmore</EM>, <EM>Chicken Run</EM>, or <EM>Liar, Liar</EM>, all of which are retarded movies that actually made me want to go home and vomit some more. But I stuck it out. <EM>Field Day!</EM> I reminded myself. So while the rest of my class stared in wide-eyed wonder at the ""glory"" that is Adam Sandler playing an Anger Management dropout who has resorted to hitting golf balls around while imagining practically naked women drinking beer, I contented myself with flipping through the yearbook and being mad that the yearbook staff resorted to such a retarded title when mine ended up being an ""overused"" one. <EM>Happy Gilmore</EM> finally ended, but unfortunately, the Senior Award Ceremony thingamajig was still going, so we Lowly Sophomores in homeroom 10N moaned and groaned and begged for it all to end while Mrs. Bond did some channel surfing and finally settled on <EM>Ellen Degeneres</EM> (I love her) who was dancing with Usher. Unfortunately, our little Entertainment Hour was cut short when the SB staff decided, HEY!!! Let's play the same three movies over again!!! What a fun idea!!! So Mrs. Bond put on <EM>Chicken Run</EM>.</P>
<P>*headdesk*</P>
<P>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>I spent that hour reading and re-reading and re-re-reading the school newspaper when FINALLY, the anonymous announcement woman came on and let us know that we were ALMOST FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...to go to 7th period. But that's ok!!! I can live through an hour and a half of English if it means being able to run around under the firehose later on.</P>
<P>The bell rang (at last!!!) and I scampered off to find Megan in order to arrange a meeting place after 7th period so that I could follow her around and bother her during Field Day, and then I ran into Mia and she started screaming, ""I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!!!"" and so on and so forth so I walked with her to her band class while we caught up a bit and then I scampered off to English where my usual seat near my friends had been taken by BRYCE (ewwwwwwwwwwww!!!) so I was forced to sit somewhere else. Luckily, Mrs. Land took pity on all of us hyperactive children and didn't make us learn today - instead, we bounced around the classroom, signing yearbooks and just being generally annoying and stupid teenagers.</P>
<P>And then...</P>
<P>FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>I scampered (word of the day, folks) off to The Meeting Place, where I met up with Megan, Linh, and Siree. The four of us moseyed on outside where we gathered in a little group on the grass and began signing yearbooks. After we'd finished our signing craze (for the moment) we moseyed around a bit more at which point RIDA FOUND US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so happy that she'd found me because I would've just died if she'd gone to Pakistan before I got to see her again (luckily, she will be in PE on Wednesday and Friday, so *squee* I get more quality time with my favoritest Rida before she leaves *sob*). I shoved my yearbook at her and we both started scribbling madly in each other's yearbooks. I took up an entire page for myself :-D and then I gave her a big hug and started dragging her around with me. We all got some snow cones *yumyumyum* and moseyed around a bit more.</P>
<P>I saw him there. Walking with Lauren Hollahan (is that her last name? Can't remember) of all people. She's not the worst person in the world, but...she really grated my nerves last year and probably would this year if I shared any classes with her.</P>
<P>It was weird. As soon as I saw him I just thought, ""<EM>God</EM>, I wish I was shallow."" Not like <EM>shallow</EM> shallow, just shallow in the way that one-who-shall-not-be-named *cough**cough* manages to get over guys so easily, and just goes through crushes like I go through Kleenex when I've got a wicked cold. I want to get over him <EM>so badly</EM>, that's why I thought it. But...I would rather feel like this than feel nothing at all. As much as I hate it, I <EM>love</EM> feeling so deeply. It reminds me that I am <EM>something</EM> - I have this passion that I know others would <EM>kill</EM> to have. While I was being ripped apart inside, I flitted among my friends and I smiled and I laughed and I <EM>lived</EM>. It was quite strange to be feeling two completely different things at exactly the same time - I wanted to die, but I also wanted to just let go and be happy and have fun. Yes, I may not show it, but <EM>dammit</EM>, I have passion. It's what keeps me going.</P>
<P>Near the end of the day, I found Kaitlyn, so we ran off under the firehose and we got <EM>soaked</EM>. I really wanted to stretch out my arms and twirl in the ""rain"" but there was so many people there that I couldn't. But I still twirled a bit. And I shrieked and I laughed and I danced and I hugged several people...it was <EM>fantastic</EM>. I <EM>live</EM> for days like today.</P>
<P>Now I'm just dying for a good summer rain that I can go out in and twirl...I'll put on a pretty skirt and I'll go barefooted and I'll wear my hair down and I'll twirl and just live in the moment. </P>
<P>I'm feeling utterly quixotic. I'm waiting for my fairy tale to unfold. I'm yearning for my happy ending.</P>
<P>I know, it's childish and stupid and it will never happen. But I'm feeling happy tonight, so I'll just let it be for now, and I'll deal with real life later, when I need&nbsp;to. I'm soaring among the clouds, and I'm not ready to come down yet. Maybe tomorrow.</P>
<P>&lt;3</P>"

<P>OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>Ms. Turek is freaking INSANE!!!!!</P>
<P>Ok. Let me tell this is the exact occurence of events, as it's actually pretty funny (though my parents are evil and cruel).</P>
<P>So I had practically <EM>just</EM> gotten out of the shower when my mom walks up to me and says, ""Michele, your father and I have to talk to you."" And I responded - as meekly as possible, ""What did I do this time?"" knowing I hadn't done anything but also knowing that my parents have a way of twisting things to make it <EM>seem</EM> like I had done something wrong. So el madre replied, ""You'll see."" </P>
<P>And then I started freaking out.</P>
<P><EM>Oh my God, they're going to ground me for the rest of my life, I'll be stuck inside my room and they shall keep my alive on breadcrumbs and water...breadcrumbs aren't very filling and I can only stand drinking so much water...I'm going to DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!</EM></P>
<P>(I'm quite amusing when I'm freaking out, aren't I?)</P>
<P>So then I walked out of my room, and el madre, who was sitting in the office with el padre, said, ""Come in here,"" and I considered running downstairs and fleeing the house while I still had the chance. I peeked my head around the doorway and said, ""Do I have to?"" and el madre nodded and I decided to be brave and walked into the room. I looked at them expectantly, and then my dad said, ""You'll want to sit down for this.""</P>
<P><EM>Oh GODDDDDDDDDDDDDD they're going to kill me!!! They'll tie me to the chair and slowly torture me to death. I'm sure of it.</EM></P>
<P>But I sat down, keeping my eyes on them, ready to leap up if they pulled out some rope. They didn't. Instead, my dad started dialing a number on the phone.</P>
<P>...?</P>
<P>I'm pretty sure imminent death doesn't start with a phone call. Unless he was calling in some assassins...but he's too cheap for that.</P>
<P>I stared at the phone, wondering what was happening, and then discovered that el padre was dialing our voice messaging system.</P>
<P>Of course, that still didn't tell me what the hell was going on, so I continued to freak out.</P>
<P>My dad finally stopped dialing, and now he and my mom looked at <EM>me</EM> expectantly. I kept staring at the phone. </P>
<P>It began to speak...in Ms. Turek's voice.</P>
<P>My immediate reaction was, <EM>Crap, she's going to tell them that she thinks I'm a horrible student and that I deserve to be put in jail because I'm so stupid, and they'll keep me alive on even crappier food than breadcrumbs and water. I'd much rather serve my life sentence at home than in jail, thank you very much.</EM></P>
<P>The short and short of Ms. Turek's message was: ""Hi, I'm calling for Michele. I'd like you to be in the schoolwide social science fair.""</P>
<P>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>
<P>I immediately tuned out and turned to my parents, saying, ""She's fucking <EM>kidding</EM> me!""</P>
<P>I can<EM>not</EM> believe it. Wow.</P>
<P>So Mia and I have to go in early tomorrow morning to set our project up in the library. I guess Ms. Turek will give us more info then, because I have <EM>no</EM> idea what I'm supposed to do past setting up the board and little camp display thingy.</P>
<P>I'm convinced, though, that this does <EM>not</EM> suddenly mean that Ms. Turek likes me, but rather she knows how I hate doing extra work and she knows that I've just been <EM>dying</EM> for the SS Fair projects to be over with, so she is merely making me do this as further torture before the school year is over.</P>
<P>But lalala, I'm going to be in the schoolwide social science fair alongside my good buddy Mia, so I am happyhappyhappy.</P>
<P>*shriek* OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</P>"

"event","<P>I can't stand him. I can't stand the way he always has to take my good moods and stomp all over them. I hate it. It's like he&nbsp;can't stand to see me happy. Is it such a crime for me to be happy? Why must people always have to bring me down every time I'm actually feeling good? I just want to be happy. Can't I just be happy?</P>
<P>I babysat Andrew tonight. I thought I would be bored beyond belief but this time, I was actually there before they had put Andrew to bed (this has only happened once before, but they put him to bed before they left) so I had something to do. And my God is that kid adorable. He's such a sweet little kid. He has this impish little smile and this devilish little laugh, but then his smile will turn sweet and his laugh will turn euphoric and I just can't help but love the little imp. Of course, he made me suffer through about a million episodes of <EM>Dora the Explorer</EM>, so that made me love him a bit less. </P>
<P>When I first started babysitting for him, I would always get there after his parents had put him to bed. Then last time I babysat, I came before he'd been put to bed, but then his mom put him in his crib before they left. This time, I had to feed him and put him in his pajamas and then actually get him into bed. It turns out he didn't want to eat anything (which his mother warned me about beforehand, so I tried not to worry that he didn't eat anything), so instead he danced along to <EM>Dora</EM>, and then at seven I took him up to his room and let him pick out his pajamas and then I wrestled him into them (luckily he didn't squirm too much or I probably would have just given up and made him sleep in his little t-shirt and jeans) and then let him watch an episode of <EM>Scooby-Doo</EM> before finally putting him into his crib.</P>
<P>I'm surprised that I actually feel willing to babysit him again. I was sure I'd be ready to kill the little imp by the end of the night.</P>
<P>Maybe next time I babysit him I'll take a picture of him and let you guys see him. He's cute, in a quirky sort of way.</P>
<P>...I can't believe I just spent an entire entry talking about the kid I babysat.</P>
<P>I think I'm a little delirious.</P>
<P>I need sleep.</P>

We will rent lots of movies (assuming that my mom remembers to put my name on her Video Warehouse card) and we will get more of those little Ben&amp;Jerry's ice cream thingies (and I will make Megan eat with a plastic spoon so she doesn't chip her tooth again...you will never live that down, Meg).

"event","<P>Have you ever just stood next to someone and felt this oddly strong connection to them, having never spoken to or even <EM>seen</EM> them before? Or is that just me?</P>
<P>I know. I'm weird.</P>
<P>But it happened to me today while I was working, and it was so...<EM>unnerving</EM>, yet so refreshing. I don't know. It's hard to explain. But there I was, doing card straightening (is it really necessary to check every single card to make sure it has a corresponding envelope??? No, I think not.) and someone just came over and started looking at some cards behind me and before I'd even looked at them or heard their voice, I just felt that oddly strong connection to them. It completely overwhelmed me and I had an urge to just run away from the person. But I didn't. And I was glad I didn't because after the person left, I felt awed to have this connection to this person even though I still don't know who it was (though I did see the person and hear their voice...but I can't remember them now). </P>
<P>Strange things happen to me at work.</P>
<P>And I am very upset because Rida leaves for Pakistan in two weeks, so there will be no more fun quotes of the day to share, and no more of the ritual ""dropping of Rida's things"" in Study Hall, and there will be no one around to share my hate of Casey Mailley (I <EM>hate</EM> her!!! Thank cheese curls she's going to Briar Woods next year. Of course, so is everyone else...). I'll really miss Rida. I'll probably never see her again, as we never get a chance to see each other outside of school. I hate losing people. I'm sick of losing people. Every time someone else moves away or decides I'm not good enough for them, I lose a little piece of my heart, and I'm running out of pieces to lose. I feel like I've got these gaping holes in my heart, and I don't know how to fill them up again. It seems that for every person I ""gain"", I lose about five more. When will the day come when there's no one left to lose and my heart is completely gone and there's no way to get it back?</P>
<P>Gah. I need to stop thinking like this.</P>
<P>Heh. I was flipping through my Black Jewels Trilogy books (I forget what I was looking for, but there was just something I needed...) and I found something I found quite ironic.</P>

"event","<P>Took my History SOL today. Was surprised by how much I remembered and how much I didn't know. Blegh. Looks like it could go either way with the whole ""passing"" thing. Le sigh.</P>
<P>At least I got to miss math, eh?</P>
<P>In AP, we got to listen to each other's songs about modern day society. Two people chose ""Where Is The Love?"" by Black-Eyed Peas. There was also ""Sleeping In"" by The Postal Service (*cheer*), ""Renegades of Funk"" by Rage Against The Machine (I think - either way, I didn't like it), ""B.Y.O.B."" by System of a Down (which was okay, I suppose...that was Sab's song), ""The Curse Is Gone"" by Billy Q (I think...that one was Meredith's), and then my song, ""Sophomore Slump Or Comeback Of The Year"" by Fall Out Boy (*CHEER*). And I think that was it. My song was so the best. :-P</P>
<P>P.E. - we finally got to play tennis again, but unfortunately, we still haven't started archery. Gah. Then we played dodgeball against the Freshmen (again!!!) and I got several of them out (yay!) and then the people on the sidelines started shouting, ""Go make a basket, Michele!"" so they could come back in but I refused because I am horrible at shooting, so I tried to convince Mia to go, but she didn't want to either. So oh well. I still got people out. That's good enough for me.</P>
<P>Now I am in PJ, and once again listening to Fall Out Boy because I &lt;3 them. Fall Out Boy = Love. Tehe. And Mrs. Ellis finally gave us the brochure about the yearbook camp for the summer, so I'm going to look it over soon and figure out which course interests me the most. I may just go for a photography one. I like taking pictures, and I would love to learn how to atleast attempt to perfect my picture-taking skills.</P>
<P>I'm glad I actually have things to do this summer. I just know that if I didn't have things set out for me to do, I'd just end up sitting around the house, being bored and thinking about what a crap year this was. I don't want my summer to be spent like that (again). I'm going to make the best of this summer.</P>

"event","<P>Forgot to write yesterday.</P>
<P>So.</P>
<P>Ugh.</P>
<P>I can't keep doing this to myself. I let the smallest things get to me, and I always take the little things to mean something HUGE, but I can't help it. I get myself all worked up and paranoid and before you know it, there's nothing I want more than to crawl inside a hole in the ground and stay there for a long, long time. I know I shouldn't feel like that. But I do, and there's nothing I can do to change it. Guess I'll just have to ride out this storm, eh?</P>
<P>And if that rambling made no sense...basically, I'm talking about Java. Ok, I'll just say his name because everyone already knows who it is (including him): Jon. And if you didn't know, WHERE have you been??? (Except you, Nicole, cuz I know where you've been.)</P>
<P>Yesterday at lunch, because his math class was taking an SOL, Jon had A lunch along with me, Megan, Mia, and The People That Hate Me. (Of course it would be <EM>that</EM> day, why should the universe be kind to me and let him have A lunch on the day that I don't?) Usually, we all sit at the same table and I just talk to Megan and Mia and occasionally Kristen and Katie, but of <EM>course </EM>something had to go wrong. Linh wanted Megan to sit with her, so Megan did (I suppose I forgive you, Meg, BUT IF YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN, I WILL EAT YOU ALIVE!!!) and because Mia always sits on the opposite side of the table, right between The People That Hate Me, it's kinda hard to talk to her. Of course, that day, <EM>Jon</EM> sat next to her, making one of The People That Hate Me scoot down one. So there he was, talking to The People That Hate Me and Mia, and I was forced to sit quietly and pick at my food that I suddenly didn't feel like eating. I talked a bit with Kristen and Katie, but not much because they're usually off talking about Important Junior Things. And he kept giving me these <EM>looks</EM>, as though he wanted to ask me why the <EM>hell</EM> I was there, and would I mind going somewhere else? I wished the earth would swallow me whole. I would have just gotten up and sat with Megan, or even gone to find Rida to sit with her, but...I've got <EM>some</EM> pride. I wouldn't let them see how much I wanted to die just then. I couldn't. So I picked at my food, not even touching my cookie (and I <EM>always</EM> eat my cookie!!!) and then sat staring at the table. </P>
<P>Then a strange thing happened.</P>
<P>One of The People That Hate Me started talking to me.</P>
<P>Of course, it was about a very mild subject (she asked if I had read <U>Trickster's Queen</U> yet, which I haven't, but I am still planning to), but after completely ignoring the fact that yes, I <EM>do</EM> exist for a couple of weeks, it's just odd of her to acknowledge that I'm <EM>not</EM> merely a figment of her imagination. Somehow, the topic moved from <U>Trickster's Queen</U> to <EM>Star Wars: Episode III</EM>, and we all joined in on a fairly heated discussion of the movie. I missed that analytical aspect of her - Julie, that is. We always used to do things like that - bring up a movie we'd seen or a book we'd read and just analyze it and debate it for what seemed like hours. It was great. And somehow we just fell back into that during lunch. I was thankful for the reprieve from looking like a total social recluse in front of Jon, but at the same time, I'm left - once again - wondering, ""Where the hell do we stand?"" I have no idea. And I'm scared to bring it up. It feels kind of like she made the first move...but I'm wondering if it was more of a ""I just need to get this out"" thing rather than a ""Hey, I wanna be friends again"" thing. The latter just seems kind of...nyah. I don't know. My brain refuses to think straight (which isn't very good as I've got my History SOL tomorrow morning - GAH!!!).</P>
<P>After school, I walked home in the rain (probably not the smartest thing to do, but I just <EM>felt</EM> like it - besides, I hardly felt the rain. I was so wrapped up in just <EM>thinking</EM>.) listening to my new Fall Out Boy CD (which is the most awesomest CD ever!). I was thinking about everything that had happened that day, and remembering the way Jon looked at me and the way he talked to one of The People That Hate Me and the way she had this smug look on her face as though she'd won some battle and it just overwhelmed me and I wanted to just fall onto the grass and not move until all this had passed because I really can't handle all of this and you may think I can but I can't no matter what I say or how I act I just <EM>can't do this</EM>. That was basically my exact stream of thought when I felt my eyes get wet and I began to wonder whether it was just the rain getting into my eyes or not. I'm still not sure. </P>
<P>How much more of this can I take? I already feel like I'm at my limit. How much worse can things get?</P>
<P>Looking back on the past few years...<EM>much</EM> worse. </P>
<P>I went to the dentist today. They began talking about having my wisdom teeth pulled out.</P>
<P>Life just gets better and better, doesn't it?</P>"

"event","<P>So. My weekend. And also today.</P>
<P>Saturday I went to work and I was COMPLETELY out of it. To prove my completely-out-of-it-ness: I rang this one man up - pretty old, very sweet and all - and after I handed him his bag and said the traditional ""Have a great day!"" he said, ""You too, Michele,"" and I just stared at him as he walked away, thinking, ""How the hell did he know my name???"" And then I figured it out: I wear a fucking name tag. Duh. I told Mahum this little story and she laughed for about an hour. Le sigh.</P>
<P>Yesterday, my dad and I drove up to Pennsylvania. We left at about 7:30 AM and didn't get home until nearly 1 AM. Now, I didn't get much sleep Friday night because Mia and I got home late from the movie and then I had to get up early for work, and Saturday night I didn't fall asleep until about&nbsp;3 AM because I was doing homework and suffering (once again) from insomnia and then my dad woke me up at 6 AM, so this morning, my alarm went off and I literally rolled out of bed because I could hardly stand, I was so tired. I went to go put my contacts in, and then gave up because my eyes refused to stay open. I started to cry because I was just so exhausted (am I doomed to never get a decent night's sleep ever again?) and after I calmed down a bit I called my mom and begged her to let me sleep in for at least one more hour. So she told me to just get into school by 10, and I almost cried again with relief, then fell into bed for another two hours of sleep, which, surprisingly, helped a lot. I missed the Chem lab, but oh well. I got in and Dr. Mandes said I could just copy Sab's chart because: ""I actually like you."" *big grin* I'm a teacher's pet, but WHO CARES!!! Dr. Mandes has admitted to liking one of his students. I feel so honored.</P>
<P>I think for that song assignment in history, I'm gonna do ""Sophomore Slump Or Comeback Of The Year"" by Fall Out Boy. Perhaps. That may change between now and Thursday. Here are the lyrics...do they at least somewhat represent today's society? A lot of what I've deciphered is kinda metaphorical, or just plain stretching of the lyrics. Ah well.

"event","<P>Just got back from seeing Star Wars with Mia.</P>
<P>Holy crap is that movie depressing.</P>
<P>Yes, you already know what's going to happen, but to see it portrayed so vividly...I almost cried. And while I still think Hayden Christensen is the worst actor on the planet, he did&nbsp;a better job in this movie, mostly because, as Megan so eloquently put it, he just had to hide under his hood and look evil.</P>
<P>And I get too hopeful about things that I already know can't be changed.</P>
<P>It's like...you know what's going to happen because of IV, V, and VI, yet you can't help but to think, ""Get him, Yoda!"" or ""Don't do it, Anakin."" It just adds to the depression when you realize how retarded you're being about the whole thing. Le sigh. But wow. I think it quite possibly could be the best Star Wars movie - though there is still the possibility of a VII, VIII, and IX. Tehe.</P>"

"event","<p>Your relapses never effected me quite the way they do now. </p><p>The houseful of women you live with are not mother enough for T without you. </p><p>When I learned you were pregnant I said, ""Abort!"" Mostly because I didn't think you were ready to mother a child. </p><p>I lost out on your pregnancy because of my strong words. So please prove me wrong, this is one instance I won't feel pride in saying, ""I told you so."" </p><p>Be the amazing woman I  respect and know you have in you. Be the mother for Tristan that you always wanted ... To be. Take lessons from our mothers. Listen to your sister. It's time you gave up on your own life and started to think about the little boy you are beholden to. </p><p>We all have to grow up eventually. It's your turn to shine. Be the kind of mom that I want to brag about. I'm sick of worrying about you; even though I always will. </p><p>Don't fuck this up. </p><p>I love you dearly, or I wouldn't dare have the audacity to write this. I hope you call and scream at me. Leave me voicemails, so I can listen to them over and over. Tell me how wrong I am. Then prove me wrong. If you were mad at me forever but then became the worlds greatest mom, I'd still only love you more.  </p><p>Hate me if you must, but I don't believe you when you say that everything is fine. I think there is something not right and it makes me mad that you don't talk to me. I wish we could argue instead of lie to one another. I wish you'd whine to me about how shit sucks. It'd be a huge improvement over the plastic relationship we're barely managing to hold onto. </p><p>My life isn't dandy either, but you never press me for details. </p><p>I have to ask inane questions just to keep you on the line so I can hear your voice. </p><p>Where is my friend, and what have you done to her? Bring her back to me! </p><p>Remember when we used to talk to one another about trivial minutia? </p><p>I feel like I am losing my sanity again and I feel like you know what I mean. </p><p>Call me. This obviously needs an edit but I'm probably going to send it anyway. Write me back even. But don't wait too long, I'm not giving up and I know where you live. </p><p>Haha, that last part sounded more creepy than threatening. </p><p><lj-cut text=""""></lj-cut></p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

Which for anyone who doesn't know is a tree slash shrub common on the cape.

"event","<p>I miss friends like I used to miss drugs. </p><p><br>Is this what time passing does? </p><p>Lua is Having surgery in two days. The thing I was told I didn't have to stress about is actually cancer. I'm afraid of who I'd be without her. She's somehow managed to keep me sane while she's never failed to drive me insane. </p><p>I miss Nikita. I think whatever, if ever, I open a business I should name it after him. </p><p>Restaurant or bar it could easily be called Nikita's. Or La Femme...</p><p>I propositioned Matty tonight to become my wife. I need someone I'm not intimate with to look after me. And Lua.

"event","<p>  Dearest lj friends. I've deleted Facebook. Who knows how long I'll be able to live without it. Can you read the underwritten irony? Do you understand how difficult these past few weeks have been? I'm not sure how long it'll last myself. </p><p>It's funny, I never felt like I was able to get very personal on there. Yet I feel so disconnected without it. </p><p>Ask me sometime about my aunt Laurie. I admire her in so many ways. She has always screened phone calls and yet she's a true die hard friend to those in need of a confidant. </p><p>I'm gussy or I'd continue on this train of thought. As it is.... I'm thru for now. </p><p>Gooodnight and happy valentines</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","wow... first entery. well, yesterday was cool. I went to the great escape with some of my friends, and i went on the sky coaster. now the drop for the boomerang seems like nuthin. and i met this kid. and i think i like him. but i dont know yet. because everyyone i went with likes him, sept for my freind gina. but this kid, he has a girlfriend. And when he told us, everyone stared at me, and he still didnt figure it out. i want to see him again, but i dont think i can. and that makes me upset

today was fun, viki and gina came over. and we went swimmin, and watched the pirates of the cariibean, and it was cool becaues after , i went back to ginas and i tok all this stuff out from under her bed, and she had so mush stuff, it was so funny some of the things i found. 

this kid i met yesterday, he likes the same kinda music i do. and thats good, because i like music, and its something that i really like. but when he left to talk to his girlfreind, my heart kinda sank. but o well, life is fair, no matter what people say. you get so many good things in your life, and then you take them for granted, and when you do, then they get taken away, because you should charish every extra thing that you dont need. 

live life like you die tomorow"

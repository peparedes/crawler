and i need a jason hug right now...but he probably hates me (again) because he found out about me and spencer.  oh goodie.

but mostly i want a spencer phone call that he understands why i was acting the way i was....but i doubt i'll get that.

this just hasn't been my day.

"event","i think the shins were on to something when they said that ""caring is creepy""

i wish that i was a robot....and really had no way of expressing or receiving emotion...because i obviously suck at both.

i don't believe that love exists...and maybe i never did.  i see affection and i see appreciation...but how can love exist mutually between two people?  doesn't one get bored...or doesn't one smother the other?  i have yet to see perfect examples of love in my generation....

i mean i see my parents and my older sister...but that is so far beyond anything in my emotional capacity.  i'm happy being alone as long as i'm not surrounded by self proclaimed ""soul mates""...and even then i talk myself out of wanting someone.  because honestly....what's the point? nothing is permanent anymore. marriage is a cop out for most people...just a step up from a plateau of happiness....or a step down depending on how you look at it.  

but the funny thing is...i really wouldn't mind being married....even if it was just companionship....because then you would always have a friend....and good health insurance?  

this cynical attitude is weird and totally unexpected because i'm a hopeless romantic...FOR OTHER PEOPLE...but for me?  no way.  there is no way that a man could just show up with flowers ""because i wanted to""  or buy you some hot chocolate for no reason just because you happened to love it....that is for other people...in books and movies.  usually not for real life and especially not for me.  i would be overjoyed if a boy would call me when he said he was going to....or took me on a date once in our measely relationship that will probably end in a late night text or phone message.

and maybe the true romantic in me is still holding on for the day when i snap out of this....but 4 months of damage is going to take more than a cheap dinner and a kiss goodnight."

This post may seem cryptic because its just going to be random thoughts from my head...but if whoever reads this really wants an explanation...well maybe later beeyotch....ha ha.

Did I settle for something that I always had?  What's going to happen to us when it comes time to leave?  Will I just walk away...or will I have to be dragged?  I hate being the last to hang on...I'm so scared.  Why do I choose NOW to have such a short attention span?

I miss what I had.  a level headedness...no attachment...but i wanted this when i had no attachment.  why do i have to contradict myself?  i suck.

what did he mean when he said that?  is this all just a fabrication because ""i care""  or is there more to this picture that i won't ever see?  how does he feel when i'm not there?

uh...so no one ever reads this but madi...so i want to post here...because people can read my myspace blog...and in a weird way...that weirds me out...real bad.

so i just want to devote a whole blog to jason...because i feel like it....and it's past the time when i thought i would curse anything if i wrote about it...so i'm going to.

jason is the sweetest person I've ever met.  he really is.  and he's like a big teddybear that gives the best hugs in the world.  and i love when he holds my hand...and even though its nothing new anymore...everytime he grabs my hand -my insides do this crazy jumpy thing...that for a second feels like i might throw up...but then i chill out and realize that i am just so happy.  

i wish i could be more poetic about it...because the situation deserves a pretty explanation...but i can't....i lost that ability a long time ago.

and i used to be scared, but i'm not anymore...because i know he loves me....because he tells me every chance he gets.  and sometimes when we sneak out of choir...he gives me little cheek kisses...and i swear i must go as red as the sweater i was wearing today.  

its weird though...because i'm scared to talk to him about future things...because i don't know if he will be there.  i don't know how it will end...or when it will end, but i know that it has to.  i'm not necessarily anticipating it, because i'm so happy just living in the moment...i'm more just...uh...prepared.  like a boy scout.  but enough about that.

this is starting to turn really sappy...and frankly...quite sucky....so....

I know that seems really stupid because by the time you're 17 years old you should know whether or not you like bananas. Although, did you know that when you eat bananas you attract more mosquitoes.

""does he ever get the girl?""

i've got a life that i never knew i was so involved in.  i was floating above it all this time.  i was living a half life. where i lived from weekend to weekend when something would happen to keep me happy...and that was just being near him.  i was functioning from an outside force...a boy!  a stupid boy.  

so now i'm me again....and i feel weird.  i feel almost fake, like this isn't how i'm really supposed to be.  i don't know why...this is how i've always seen myself.  the girl that laughs at almost everything, who is always semi-awkward, with bad eyesight, and frumpy sweaters.  this is who i've always been, but it feels different because around him i only laughed when conveinent, i was confident, i never wore my glasses, and although i still wore the same old sweaters...they didn't feel as frumpy knowing that he still probably thought that i was ""beautiful.""

isn't it funny how confusion comes at times of bliss, and you only seem to be content with the lack of resolutions when you are miserable?

 i can't get you off my mind. and the fact that it isn't a joke anymore just adds to the insanity.

it doesn't help that this is the millionth time it has happened, but it was different and it was cute and wonderful and so very destructive all at the same time.

Karen and Brent talked some sense into me on Tuesday night.  Now I miss him more than ever, but i'm still just fooling myself into thinking that things would be different, but they wouldn't be.  i hate how my mind works like that, always against me.  can't i win just once???

Madi and I went and got ice cream on Wednesday to celebrate the year anniversary of our doomed relationships....it was really good, until I got the regular and ate it really fast, and then felt sick.

I saw the Spongebob movie last night, actually really funny, and very suggestive at parts...but funny none the less.

Today was Turkey day.  I dont' think that i want to get married or have babies anymore...my sisters were constantly freaking out....at their husbands, at their kids...it was annoying...and kind of awkward for the rest of us.  but they've always been like that, so I guess i can still get married, but the kids thing......still not sure.  childbirth?  no thank you!

I'm so insanely love sick and bored...bad combination.  If i could fight my boredom then i wouldn't feel so lonely or lovesick...but i don't feel like calling anyone because i have nothing to say...so i'll just sit here and relentlessly type out my frustrations.  

i want egg nog right now.  that sounds really good.

christmas is in 31 days.  i'm so excited....although my punctuation isn't showing it very well.

well....i miss my brentie...i'm so dependent on the kid...he's in Vegas, he's been gone for a day and i really genuinely miss him already.  wow...i'm crazy.

i'm tired...the musical is taking so much out of me....blah...but it's so much fun...so i don't really care.

the halloween dance was fun...i didnt' think that my dress would get quite the comments it did....but it was like i was wearing a big neon sign that said ""look at me!!!""  or i might as well have been....because everyone stared and it made me fell funny. our group was fun...i love big groups...girl choice dances blow formals out of the water!!!  hahahahah beat that scummy boys!!!

my last entry was so dramatic and i don't even know if i really felt that way...something was wrong so i attributed it to people ""breaking"" me but...um....i haven't gotten close enough to a person to be truly broken...so yeah...disreguard that crap.  it was still pretty though...so consider it a made up story about a sad little girl.

"event","so this weekend has been quite eventful...but not really all that fun.  On Friday I decided that I wanted to go to the game out in Davis....and I also (stupidly) promised Harrison that I would help him with a sign for his little brother's birthday.  BAD IDEA!  I got sucked into going down to the car wash for the Volleyball team with him...that's right just me and him.  it looked like a date...to the WHOLE volleyball team.  then we went back to his house and made the sign and then, because there was no time to take me home, i had to go with him to a spaghetti dinner...it was better because this time Taylor and his older brother Parker came...but it still looked like a date.  he even said ""this is like a cheap date!""  so then when we finally got on the road to the game...i was like ""do you really wanna go to the game?  cuz i sure don't!""  and so then we decided not to go...and we went and rented a movie called Camp  it was supposed to be ""A Comedy About Drama""  and it was...but it was sad because I was the only one there that found it really funny....so we turned it off.

then i went home....and it was only 10:25.  sad, i know.  then my mom had a chat with me about how i'm losing my ""girlfriends"" and how i hang out with boys too much...i mean seriously...the only two girls i normally hang out with are karen and madi...and they want nothing to do with football games or the boys i hang out with....so...um...gonna go for the boys right now...because its not like karen and madi want to hang with me anyways.

so on saturday i had to babysit and then i went to the mall with Scott....we were both bored and it was funny because we HAD to go into buckle...and i laughed because he bought me ""dinner"" at chick fil a....and it again, was like a date...except it wasn't nearly as awkward because i haven't currently liked scott...and the whole volleyball team wasn't there.  then i went over to beckie's...i had to beg scott to come with me...he wasn't to happy with me either...i accidentally kicked him in the face.

so we get to becky's and me and scott are the only ones to show up...but then more people end up coming, harrison tried to light me on fire...and i threatened him that if he touched me, he would be sorry.  i figure that if i'm only his sister...he better start treating me like one...and you just don't rub your sister's leg or hold her hand.  so if he even brushed up against me...i yelled ""DON'T TOUCH ME!!!!"" and it was hilarious...because it really pissed him off...he said ""I want to touch you because you are so beautiful.""  yeah...whatever.

then we played fugitive...that was really fun...and suspensful..but harrison was like my puppy dog the whole night and ALWAYS had to ride with me.  blah.  so then i went home...and it was 11:15.

so sunday...blah blah, regional conference....lots of people...
my dad talked with the mom of the boy i used to like...it was weird.
i talked to madi and karen online about their hot date.  me and madi end up in a fight...although...i don't know why.  heaven forbid people make decisions for themselves.  i'm such a horrible friend lately...but it's kind of hard to like other people when you aren't to fond of yourself.  anyways....then i had brownies....

and now it is 9:37.

this is a really long post...but i had lots to type...and i'm so bored right now.  i hate being in fights with friends...it sucks a lot.

so....devin found out who i was....not that i was trying to be secretive about it...i just didn't think he would care so much about who i was.  its funny....more people know me then i think....how?

maybe i do need to hang out with boys less....boys are dirt bags anyways...but then again...the only way i eat on the weekends is because of boys....so maybe they can stay around until i get paid by my sister.

so much money to pay!!!!  ahhhhhhhh..... school is supposed to be FREE!!!

"event","so this weekend has been quite eventful...but not really all that fun.  On Friday I decided that I wanted to go to the game out in Davis....and I also (stupidly) promised Harrison that I would help him with a sign for his little brother's birthday.  BAD IDEA!  I got sucked into going down to the car wash for the Volleyball team with him...that's right just me and him.  it looked like a date...to the WHOLE volleyball team.  then we went back to his house and made the sign and then, because there was no time to take me home, i had to go with him to a spaghetti dinner...it was better because this time Taylor and his older brother Parker came...but it still looked like a date.  he even said ""this is like a cheap date!""  so then when we finally got on the road to the game...i was like ""do you really wanna go to the game?  cuz i sure don't!""  and so then we decided not to go...and we went and rented a movie called Camp  it was supposed to be ""A Comedy About Drama""  and it was...but it was sad because I was the only one there that found it really funny....so we turned it off.

then i went home....and it was only 10:25.  sad, i know.  then my mom had a chat with me about how i'm losing my ""girlfriends"" and how i hang out with boys too much...i mean seriously...the only two girls i normally hang out with are karen and madi...and they want nothing to do with football games or the boys i hang out with....so...um...gonna go for the boys right now...because its not like karen and madi want to hang with me anyways.

so on saturday i had to babysit and then i went to the mall with Scott....we were both bored and it was funny because we HAD to go into buckle...and i laughed because he bought me ""dinner"" at chick fil a....and it again, was like a date...except it wasn't nearly as awkward because i haven't currently liked scott...and the whole volleyball team was there.  then i went over to beckie's...i had to beg scott to come with me...he wasn't to happy with me either...i accidentally kicked him in the face.

so we get to becky's and me and scott are the only ones to show up...but then more people end up coming, harrison tried to light me on fire...and i threatened him that if he touched me, he would be sorry.  i figure that if i'm only his sister...he better start treating me like one...and you just don't rub your sister's leg or hold her hand.  so if he even brushed up against me...i yelled ""DON'T TOUCH ME!!!!"" and it was hilarious...because it really pissed him off...he said ""I want to touch you because you are so beautiful.""  yeah...whatever.

then we played fugitive...that was really fun...and suspensful..but harrison was like my puppy dog the whole night and ALWAYS had to ride with me.  blah.  so then i went home...and it was 11:15.

so sunday...blah blah, regional conference....lots of people...
my dad talked with the mom of the boy i used to like...it was weird.
i talked to madi and karen online about their hot date.  me and madi end up in a fight...although...i don't know why.  heaven forbid people make decisions for themselves.  i'm such a horrible friend lately...but it's kind of hard to like other people when you aren't to fond of yourself.  anyways....then i had brownies....

and now it is 9:37.

this is a really long post...but i had lots to type...and i'm so bored right now.  i hate being in fights with friends...it sucks a lot.

so....devin found out who i was....not that i was trying to be secretive about it...i just didn't think he would care so much about who i was.  its funny....more people know me then i think....how?

"event","At the risk of sounding over dramatic and all....a question to all of those who might read this...Do you ever feel empty?  I don't mean it in a way that is so super stupid...just...do you ever feel not good or bad or even in between but you feel empty of emotions and thoughts?  I felt like that today...and it seemed like someone could have run up to me and fallen over dead and i would have just sat there and said ""oh, that sucks.""  Maybe that isn't the best way to explain it...but that's what it sure felt like.

Side note to those who have replied to me (Ryan and Madi) thanks for your comments....um....i took them into consideration...and well....i liked them a lot.


Whoever said ignorance is bliss was so wrong...can i just say that?  i mean really...in some cases..maybe.  Like if there was a spider in my room and i was asleep and it was crawling on my legs or what not...i figure if i don't know about it...i don't really care.  (as long as it doesn't bite me) ...but in other cases...like trying to pretend that something isn't there when it is...that is really hard to do...and about as far from bliss as you can get.

what else...what else....hmmmm.....Junior girls...or maybe just girls in general are SO moody...it's driving me crazy lately!!!  why can't every one just stop the crying and yelling and stressing and fighting and over-dramatizing...just STOP IT BEYOTCH!!!

okay...i'm done."

so last night sally ratted my hair and lined my eyes with really dark brown eyeliner...she decided that this was supposed to make me look like a skank, but in her eyes it made me look ""hot.""  and then she was talking about how she was jealous and blah blah blah...and my english teacher told me that i was ""beautiful"" and one time i was just sitting there talking all retarded and madi was like ""you're really pretty""  and that is nice and all and i totally love them all...but seriously....don't you think that I would at least KNOW if I was pretty...because sometimes with the aid of lots of makeup and the right clothes...i look okay...but not pretty or beautiful. and if anything the people telling me these things are prettier than i am...so i don't know what kind of drugs they are on...

anyways...i'm tired and i really should do homework...school sucks...a whole bunch."

"event","So yesterday I decided that boys just hate me and don't understand me.  Oh...sure they understand the ditzy blonde with the big chest, but they don't understand me.  And why is it that way?  Why does this world, boys included, have to be so shallow and vapid that all they can see is the outside?  I'm sure everyone goes through this phase where this question bothers them...but have they really experienced it first hand like I have?  Being ignored because you don't have the body or ""intellect"" that matches that same big chested ditz?  Or being underestimated because somebody was supposedly smarter than you. or a bigger suck up than you. or someone prettier than you.  I've faced those all...I know I'm not the only one...but it still hurts that even though I know that i'm a good person,that I still have to prove myself to everyone daily.  I have to prove myself to my best friends.  I have to compete for their approval, and i've lost too many times.  so its starting today....i don't have to prove myself to anyone...as long as i keep a firm grip on who i am...nobody should question me...worry about themselves.  i'm sick of living this life for other people and i hated the fact that i couldn't do anything about it because people always assumed that i was the one to help them with all their problems when they didn't realize that i have many of my own.  i'm not gonna be push around natalie anymore...so what if people mistake me for a bitch...that's better, in my eyes, than a pushover.  i'm not gonna go quietly...people are going to see me and know me instead of judging me as everyone else or as someone not important.


maybe this makes no sense.....i hope it does....but really....its early...so don't question me!!!"

Madi thinks that I condemn her for hating him and being bitter about it...that's not it at all...cuz she can be bitter if she wants to be...but she just can't let it control her.  once she does that...mitch, once again, has won.  oh well...she's on the way there...except i fear that all the stuff she built up this summer is going to come crashing down when he is near her in class....blah...boys suck so bad.  sally and mike broke up...and although he broke up with her...i'm still proud of her for being so strong about stuff.  and now he ignores her...which she totally doesn't deserve....but whatever.  yeah...well this is just some superficial, boring post. get over it."

I just like to type and tell things about myself and pretend that people actually care...when they don't and shouldn't because my life is so pathetically boring...but i'm gonna bore them anyways.  so this morning I was awoken by the sound of a  5 pound dog howling like a coyote...i didn't understand why...it was so weird.  then i looked at the clock and realized that it was 7:13 am....and then i was mad...but i got over it.  i've been sitting the rest of the morning watching VH1 and MTV flipping back and forth whenever a stupid rap or over popped ""punk"" song comes on....music is seriously going down the drain these days.  so registration was yesterday....nothing new or exciting...except that people called me pretty...which isnt and everyday occurance....so that was at least something semi-worth remembering.  Have you ever had a week where you aren't overly happy but you aren't really sad...you are just kind of blah?  I've had one of those weeks...and to my usual happy self...i feel really sad...but i'm allowed to not be perky 24/7 right?  sometimes people act like i'm not...like i ALWAYS have to be the optimistic, sunshiny one.  oh well...its hard for me to not be...but this week...i just don't care.  now i'm rambling about nothing...i wish i had some interesting story to tell...and i guess i do...but i'm tired of telling it..and everyone and their dog must have heard it by now.  i had a weird dream...karen was dressed up like a boy...sitting next to ted on the grass in front of Bates Elem. (our old school) and then i went and took a picture of them and then they decided that they wanted coffee...that was weird.  anyways, i miss structure to my life....school=structure.....well for the most part...  i do the ... things a lot.  oh well.  yesterday i got blamed for something i didn't even do...my friend yelled some comment about being a whore in the middle of Wendy's and then i drove to the valley and got ice cream that melted....really bad.  i have another thing about registration...but in order to keep this a decent length...i'll use another post to tell it."

I love having that level-headed feeling after getting over something that has consumed your life for the last 10 months.  seriously...i could care less if i see him again...he was a bad friend and i'm okay with never talking to him.  all the friends i need...i already have karen, brent, madi, sally, and cole.  sometimes taylor and kenzie and others too...but seriously...just those five will do.  anyways...i haven't written in a while and there are things that i've been meaning to say...but i can't remember them.  oh wait!!! i remember...i want to go the the Fashion Institute of California....I want to design shoes. and this is so far fetched for me!! my last dream occupation was a doctor...which i still want to be..but not until i'm old or something...i don't want to be so tied down when i'm still young.  i want to go to school in california and bask in the sun all the time and go to all the cute boutiques...uhhh...i'm turning into my sisters....they talk about such materialistic things for being married with kids and all...and maybe its because i've never really heard them talk...just the two of them...but it was weird to me.  for once though, i felt like an outcast in my own family.  not in a horrible way, but i just felt so different about everything in my life.  its probably the age differences, 8 years will do that to you.  i wish i could write beautifully....oh how i miss writing good poetry...now it just seems to be the same.  i mean i was never that good of a poet but before i got into this writers block thing...i can't write anything...now i sound really old.  wow...this is really long...but typing is soothing to me right now.  school registration is in a week and i wish that i could go back with something different about me...like the weight i was supposed to lose...which didn't happen...or with some new found confidence...but the only thing that will be different is my hair....which i'm getting cut tomorrow!  oh well...screw all the people who expect me to change cuz i like the way i am.  i like that i can help people with their problems but not get too involved to the point where i feel that their problems are mine...and i like that i'm not the drama queen i used to be.  maybe i have changed though and it has just been so gradual that i haven't noticed it.  yeah...well i'm gonna wrap this up cuz i really need to go to bed right now.....i'm tired.

I hate to see people cry and if for the right reasons I'll cry along with them, but does it make me a bad person if I don't cry with them?  One of my very best friends just ""separated"" from this kid that was her....unofficial ""boyfriend."" The kid (Ryan Brandom) said that the she was unexperienced and then she's failing Chemistry which is causing her to become futher and futher away from her true happiness, drama.  My other friend is very slowly losing her appetite which I think is due to the fact that she is suppressing her feelings of love for someone who very well could love her back.  People in my school are pregnant, people do drugs and people make bad decisions, but for some reason I still can't make myself cry.  Am I really so wrapped up in my problems that the only thing that can really cause me to cry is a superficial chick flick?  If so, I hate that."

One time when I was little I got hit in the stomach by the bar and I almost blacked out...it hurt really bad.  That is why life is like a merry go round...you want to be included so bad and sometimes you are and you spin around for ever and ever, but that makes you sick and so you want to get off.  Then there are the times that you try to get on, but it won't let you and it hurts you and you never want to try again because it caused you so much pain.  I have to say to everyone though, never stop trying to get on because the nausea you feel from being on it for way too long is better than the nausea you get from being rejected...trust me, I know.  So even though I say, literally, that I don't like merry go rounds, theoretically I really do and I couldn't think of a better analogy for life...well I could, but you know what I mean."

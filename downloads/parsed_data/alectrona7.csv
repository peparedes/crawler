"event","but i've finally given in to peer pressure and have gotten myself a livejournal. I've been reluctant to in the past because i don't really think that my life would make an interesting read, but hey, we'll see how we go.

before we start, i must warn you that i may contradict myself a fair bit, but i'm a gemini and am meant to think in 2 frames of mind and switch between them without notice... well that's your notice! :P

this journal will probably be a friend's only journal, so if you want to be added to my list, please post a reply to this with your details. Thanks. :D"

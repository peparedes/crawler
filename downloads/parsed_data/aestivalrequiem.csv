xthexluckiestx: ok
xthexluckiestx: im sleepy
XMaggieMoshX: read this
XMaggieMoshX: i promise you won't be
XMaggieMoshX: http://www.muslimwakeup.com/info/archives/000873.php
XMaggieMoshX: There's this whole fetish with the hymen that Muslims still have more than other communities. I know a girl whose little sister had a tricycle accident, and the parents were all worried, like, ""Does that mean she's not a virgin anymore?"" 

xthexluckiestx: sex with a tricycle...
xthexluckiestx: im sure that's someone's fetish
XMaggieMoshX: What is the Muslim attitude towards masturbation?
Well, that depends on what part of the Muslim world you're from. If you're from the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, it's totally abhorred. But if you're from the Arab world, it's not so bad. There are four or five major schools of thought in Islam, and they each have a slightly different take on the law. The ones that are more common in the Arab part of the world have scholars that talk about masturbation as a recourse for ""lonely young men."" Of course they never put it in female terms. 


xthexluckiestx: wow
XMaggieMoshX: Do women feel sexier when they take it off ?
Women who are covered up feel very sexy, let me tell you. 
xthexluckiestx: :shrugs:
XMaggieMoshX: i sorta wanna go to sleeeeeeeep
xthexluckiestx: me too
xthexluckiestx: im tired
XMaggieMoshX: where should i sleep?
xthexluckiestx: um...the guest room across the hall
XMaggieMoshX: alright
xthexluckiestx: yeah
XMaggieMoshX: i'm bringing my computer with me
XMaggieMoshX: :-)
xthexluckiestx: ok
xthexluckiestx: i'll talk to you when you're across the hall then
xthexluckiestx: if i dont fall asleep
XMaggieMoshX: alright
XMaggieMoshX: here i go
xthexluckiestx: ok
XMaggieMoshX: theres a bunch of technology on my bed
xthexluckiestx: oh
xthexluckiestx: hold on
xthexluckiestx: night dude
XMaggieMoshX: nighty night
xthexluckiestx is away at 4:48:51 AM. 
XMaggieMoshX: fantastic

Auto response from xthexluckiestx: to quote my favorite scottish person...

""your mom""

XMaggieMoshX: :-D

ahhhh. snow white and pleasant dreams."

i'm staring at my last name right now. and it seems completely foreign to me. my first thought was ""hames? whats hames? what a funny sounding word."" i feel like i'm looking at this name for the first time in my life. so i'm sitting here repeating my name over and over again. ""margaret hames. margaret logan hames"". it still looks ridiculous. maybe i identify with the logan side of me so much that sometimes i forget hames is actually my last name. i write it out of habit. hames is a silly word. h a m (as in mary) e s. like james with an h. maybe smoking so much is making me stupid. or maybe i just can't stand my last name. or maybe it really means nothing to me and i need to get rid of it. anyway, i'm hungry. but i just realized that hames rhymes with like a million things. frames, lames, shames, dames, fames, cames, games, james, mames, names, sames, and tames.
not hamies, not hamas, not ham-es, not hanes, not ames, but hames. weird."

me in the kithen. pour out what i think are french fries on to a cookie sheet. then pick up a box of what i think are chicken fingers, and pour them onto the sheet. i then realize that the first thing i placed on the sheet was in fact ""chicken fritters"" and therefore am looking at 2 different versions of the same thing. i shrug it off and decide that variety is a good thing. as i'm placing the chicken products back in the freezer, i look at hte bag of chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies. and think to myself, i wonder why there are still chocolate chip cookies in there. probably because everyone else likes the peanut butter ones. either that are i'm the only one taking cookies from teh freezer. then i think to myself: i know i would be taking cookies. i think pour my glass of milk and realize that my chicken isn't going to cook itself on top of the oven. i them proceded to place the lid to the milk in my glass to close it. i then decided this whole thing was to great to forget, and now i'm struggling to remember it. i need to go put my food in teh oven. and clean up after the party i had 2 nights ago."

"event","so classes were good today. erica found me wandering around campus lost as usual. shes so nice. after class i headed home and thats when the drama began. i got back to the house and decided to turn my tv so it faced the back room where my computer was stationed. the cable managed to get unplugged. so i went to pull out the tv and my cactus got knocked over behind the tv and i got dirt everywhere. then as i went to move the tv forward the tv fell and hit me in the head as it fell to the ground. i panicked and dropped the tv stand on my foot. so after i stopped cursing and screaming and my headache died down, i composed myself and set about fixing the connection. shortly thereafter i was electrocuted as i bumped into my fish tank. i finally got it working and decided i deserved a nap. about an hour into my nap, i had a dream that i slammed my finger in a car door. i turned out that  elliot had just bitten a chunk out of my finger. he also chewed up the egg crate thing on my mattress. then i drove to jims at a whopping 55 miles an hour due to the fact that because of 2 wide load vehicles, traffic had been reduced to one lane.

"event","so last night i went and saw jim. i was really nervous on the way there cuz as usual i was expecting the worse. but it turned out pretty well. we just lied there and held each other and talked. our relationship was kinda destined for failure from the start. he told me that the only way it could end was with him breaking my heart. cuz ultimately it comes down to the fact that hes leaving. i can break it off earlier, but it will still hurt as much as if i waited til the end. he told me to remember one thing and that was that he loves me. he told me i was amazing. that he didn't think i quite understood just how amazing i was. i told him he made me feel good about myself, that he made me feel beautiful. and he told me that someone should have told me that everyday of my life. to the outside observer, it would appear that we hated each other. but when we're alone, its perfect. we don't fight constantly, we don't argue, we just love and appreciate each other. he keeps telling me he wasn't supposed to get attached. i say its better to have loved and lost. it would be so much worse spending you life wondering what could have been. hes trying to leave now, just his loose ends so it doesn't hurt as much. but what about me? and apart from that, we all know its just going to make the whole situation worse. so now i guess we've kinda resolved to do nothing and just wait it out. enjoy each others company. this whole thing sucks. oh well. time for a smoke."

(hampton beach is full of) bitchez and hos and bitchez and hos! but all i really want is a slut!!!!"" yeah, it was excellent. so i finally drecided to get my nipples pierced and holy shit did it hurt. good god. not something i would recommend ever. infact, they hurt so bad i'm actually considering taking them out. i can't even move without being in like horrible pain. i want to walk around without a shirt on. lauren and i are both going to get tattooes on friday, so it should be fun. i'm really excited. what i'm not excited about though is the fact that i have perpetually hard nipples. thats really awkward. anyway, i need food. see ya."

"event","warped tour. sucked. but as usual, i always make the best of things. i spent the day with andrea and fatty patty.the drive there got us wicked pumped. it was really far and we were all half asleep. but we were listneing to the most random silly music ever and everyone was laughing and smiling at us. i busted out the bubbles patty gave me for my birthday and we played with those. when we got there you could pretty much tell the crowd sucked big time. we went to see big d, but it was wicked lame and i couldn't enjoy myself. so i smoked some salvia, and andrea and i bought a 30 pound bag of ice in exchange for free beer and energy drinks. once we were thoroughly sloshy we decided to play in the mud. that rapidly grew, and before we knew it, it went from the three of us to about 50 of us running, sliding, swimming and battling it out in the mud. then came the crowd participation segment where they starting throwing mud at us. we then became a unified fighting force and kicked a little ass. the kids in the crowd sucked, but the kids in the mud fucking rocked. it was so great. they were all so nice, and were just totally there to have a great time. they made my day. we had all kinds of people stopping us and taking pictures. we had magazines and newspapers making us pose for them. we even made a mud person pyramid. it was fantastic. 
oh, and my birthday. em and i went to the gym at around 10 on the 13th. then we went to the toast and everyone called me around midnight to wish me a happy birthday. i then went and bought my first legal pack of cigarettes. hooray! that day i went to work and everyone wished me a happy birthday and i felt so special! then after i went and got jim and patricia and we went back to my house and at tacos and ice cream cake with mom, jj, and myra. jj, as usual made me a special birthday drink of rum with a little coke to taste. i got all giggly and cuddly. it was so much fun. i love my friends. we took jim home and then patty and i watched lotr 3. it was one of the best birthdays ever. i just felt so cool and special. i love my friends. i know i just said that, but i really felt the need to repeat it. alright, well now i'm going to go to dinner and get pierced with lauren and boy. bye!"

her funeral was beatiful. she was too. i miss her. the funeral director gave me his hanky cuz i was crying my eyes out. shes with gram now. and her brother winny. i guess its all good in the end."

"event","so its 6 in the morning. i went to bed at 1 and woke up at 3. after 3 hours of court tv, salad, smokes, numerous trips to the bathroom and playing bubble smileon my phone, i woke up my mommy. shes taking a shower and we're going to go get breakfast together before she has work. what a wonderful lady lee hames is. speaking of work, i did some yesterday. ali called in sick and i picked up 4.5 hours. i also got a sweatshirt, a pouch and smokes. god bless dredz. lauren and i had so much fun in the half an hour we worked together. we decided to make a myspace for dredz, and had a dance party to coheed and cambria on the bubble wrap while zhanna the russian just stood there and laughed at us. then jd came in and things got lame. i had to do a ton of pricing, and the store is now stocked to the rafters with pipes, nag champa, and rasta statues. its so funny to see who comes in to buy pieces. sometimes i feel like i'm selling to my mom. its almost weirder not having to i.d. someone. i had a conversation with a 60 year old woman about getting a slide for her bubbler. oh, and lauren and i have renamed the pill snorters ""life support"". the funniest thing ever was when i heard j.d. describe their use in legal terms. ""some people have to take really big pills that they can't swallow, so they have to crush them up first."" oh man, it took every ounce of evergy in my body not to fall to the floor laughing. yeah, so i went all day yesterday without seeing senior sketchball, the old man that works at brick oven next to dredz. this dude is old enough to be my father twice over, and yet he persists to hit on me. he smiles and winks at me and asks me when i'm working next. he even remembers my work schedual. he is one creepy motherfucker. not only that, but he hardly speaks english. katie got a job working there. god have mercy on her soul. not only is she the only one who speaks english, but shes also the youngest, and the only female. the young guy that works there was doing drug deals on his celly one time while i was ordering pizza. how cute. anyway, mommy dearest is done with her shower, and now i must bid you all adeui. oh, and one more thing, does anyone want to go see charlie and the chocolate factory with me when it comes out? and lastly, the fam is all going away for the weekend, leaving poor little me alone for 3 whole nights. plans? excellent."

"event","gregory pierce is back at the beach!! he and i have hung out almost every day. i am so happy to see him again. i have so much fun when we hang out. i also forgot how much i enjoy talking with his mom. shes so nice and so funny. every time her and i talk alone shes always like ""hey maggie, what do you think of greg?"" ""you know, you're a very witty girl, you can put that boy in his place"" whenever we're together and hes not looking, she'll smile and wink at me. its so funny. last night we went to a party at patricias, it was so great. we both got wicked trashed, and ended up sleeping on this wicked obnoxious air mattress. we didn't get any sleep. we just laid there drunk as hell making jokes about the stupid mattress. then he would talk to me in german. it was hysterical. his sister katie and i are getting to know each other better too, which is great. i always wrote her off as kinda ditzy, but shes actually really cool. she got a job working at the pizza place right next to dredz. there is a wicked sketchy old man that works there that keeps flirting with me. he keeps asking me when i'm working next. icky. anyway, thats about it. don't know if i'm ever going to see jim again. oh well. its not my fault. yeah. thats all."

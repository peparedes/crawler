"event","&nbsp;I legitimately like my life now.
Who knew the fourth year would be the one where I finally had things figured out.
Who knew, who knew.
I sure didn't.

So much has happened, not just comparing last year-to summer- to this year,
a lot has happened recently, I mean.
And no one knows about any of it.
I've found that telling everyone every detail of every minute of my life good or bad 
isn't as rewarding as keeping it to myself an listening to their details for a while.
Don't worry though, I'll fill you in when the time comes, I'm not into shutting people out.

I'm so glad things are how they are though, 
because even when this week will probably be the most stressful&nbsp;of my year,&nbsp;
I'm still sane enough to stop and smile about some random little appreciated piece of my day.

This is exactly how I wanted things to be, and exactly how I wanted ME to be.
I still have my stupid bad habits, but I'm working on it.
Deep breaths are good for everything.

I know I said I wouldn't be writing in this, but it felt appropriate.
So how am I feeling?
I'm feeling a lot of things.
Good things, now.





&quot;You put me on a line, and hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I decided to go to see you
You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes
Made me realize what I could not see

And I could write a book, the one they'll say that shook
the world and then it took, it took it back from me
And I could write it down, and spread it all around
Get lost and then get found, and you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

And I could write a song, a hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me.
The streets you're walkin' on, a thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me

Oh what good is it to live, with nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive, not loving all you see
Are the streets you're walkin' on, a thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong, and you belong with me

Not swallowed in the sea, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea, yeah you belong with me, not swallowed in the sea.&quot;"

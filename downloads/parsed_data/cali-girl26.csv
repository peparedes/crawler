"event","hi, well today wasnt a good day. its really getting old how everyone thinks that im like so dumb. im out of it most of the time, but when people lie is soo obvious. I can tell when people feel a certain way and when they are lying or telling the truth. Especially when my best friends are lieing. its soo annoying. and im just getting really sick of it. ah, i always .. nvm. Well i just really had to get that out. cause its really bothering me. 

and im happy/sad cause me n matt are supposed to hang out and i dont know if we are cuase i dont know if he wants to even tho he tells me he does, it doesnt seem like it. but what ever. and now i have to go to cali, but i think me n britt are meeting up there.?! that should be fun. but i have to go there without my Matthew :-/ ahh hearbreaking!

"event","<p dir=""ltr"">All of my clothes have been gone thru, hung, folded, purged, organized as far as possible at this moment. There's a need for fabric drawers to put the lingerie in as opposed to the tote bags they've been living in. The tote bags are each assigned their own cube in the closet now, tho. They are not cluttering up the bedroom. Even pulled all my night clothes and a few other random items out of the linen closet. They've been in there so long that the black shirt I'm wearing, while otherwise clean, has ALLANAH'S fur on it!</p><p dir=""ltr"">Hint: Elspeth is 3 and a half and it.was.at least a few months before Jim could bring himself to love another cat.</p><p dir=""ltr"">I haven't worn 26/28 in over five years now. Almost all are gone from my closet. There might be a couple of drawstring peasant skirts. Most 22/24s are gone as well. Might be a sort our two left, and there's a couple of smaller cut jeans that still work. Other than that the only thing left in my closet are size 20 down to 14/16. Only one black tank, one skirt, and one sweater in 14/16 are new, bought for Jim's dad's memorial. The other 16s in the closet are 5 years old. There's still one pair of size 16 jeans I can't get into and two other pants that don't have tags, so at least I know I won't have to go nekkid when I finally managed to shed a few more pounds.</p><p dir=""ltr"">As to weightloss, I'm still bouncing between 239 and 244. I'm in mid bounce right now. But with the closet cleaned and organized I feel 20 pounds lighter than last week!</p>"

"event","My weight for the last week (now that the scale is finally working again) has stayed pretty much between 265 and 262. Assuming that my scale is not far off from the scale at the Doctor's office, that's about a 10 pound loss.

 I have not been able to go for walks the last couple of days as we have been trying to prep for the weekend. 

My glucose has been staying mostly in the 120 range.

We are going to a destination wedding this weekend. There will be considerable cheating on the new regimen. It's planned, and I will have to remind myself when I step on the scale next Tuesday that it was my own choice and to not feel like a failure. Doesn't mean I'm going to throw ALL caution to the wind, but if I can't live a little when such a special occasion comes up, what's the point, right? 

Once upon a time I was a size 26/28. That was, dunno....15 plus years ago? The last time I made an effort to lose weight i worked my way down to a definite 18, sometimes 16. When I put weight back on I settled in somewhere between 20 and 22. That's a REALLY inconvenient size because 18/20 is just too uncomfortable and 22/24 is just a little bit loose, necessitating the use of belts. 

Today is laundry day. Which means I had to grab some clean jeans for last night's outing and the handiest thing was a pair of size 22s. I spent all evening hauling my pants up from one side or the other as we trudged through the mall trying to get the last few things we need for the wedding. Basically, If I didn't keep my hand at my hip, with my fingers through a belt loop, all it was going to take was a few steps and I was going to be putting on a show for all and sundry. 

So we went to Torrid to try on some size 20 jeans. There were one or two of their jeggings that i could have worn, but I don't really appreciate seeing myself in skin tight clothing and decided that I need to take stock of my closet before I did any buying.

This morning i stated hauling out the jeans that have been sitting on my shelf for years now. The first thing, a pair of size 20 shorts, were terribly uncomfortable, though I could manage to get them buttoned.  If i'd stopped there I'd have been very disheartened, but i kept going and it turns out I have a pair of size 20 black trousers that will do just fine. Got them as a Christmas gift and never wore them as i received them when my weight was on the upswing. Glad I never bothered with exchanging them now! I've not finished, but I've also already dredged up a pair of cropped jeans and a pair of casual black pants with a pretty stitching detail on one side. I even found one pair of size 18 jeans that fit perfectly if it weren't for the huge hole in the crotch. Those are off to donation bag. 

Have to get off Facebook and finish getting ready. There's laundry to finish and packing to do before we can hop in the car (hopefully around noon) and head first to Ventura, which will be our base of operations for the weekend and then to Solvang."

"event","In recent months our apartment had been overtaken by boxes from Jim's work. Also, none of the Christmas boxes had been removed to the garage. When we got a 24 hour fire inspection notice on our door, which we discovered when we headed out to buy groceries late Sunday afternoon, the procrastination had to end. 

Most of the Christmas stuff went to the garage. What didn't go to the garage (and what had never quite gotten put away) got packed and consolidated. Jim's work stuff got sorted through and consolidated. Empty boxes that had to be kept got sent to the garage and all of the boxes that were left now reside on the dining table. 

Laundry got picked up and, once it got washed and dried Monday night, actually got folded and put away. It had to be, because it had been living on the aforementioned table. 

It's amazing how reclaiming do much space in the apartment had made me so much happier to get home in the evening.

When there's so much to do, and you just can't muster the energy to do it, your home becomes less of a haven and more of a guilt ridden depression pit.

There's still cleaning to do, and we will never be uncluttery type people, but it's so much better than it was."

"event","It starts before sunrise with everybody tracking down the other members in their group somewhere between Mickey & Friends and the Park. This early in the morning the trams aren't running so you have to walk along the tram route on foot. Lots of people stop to pose with the Halloween decorations along the way. 

Once people have found their groups they flash their wristbands at the entry gate and enter the Park, then gather on Main Street USA. (Or, like last year, Buena Vista Street in DCA) It's wall to wall people waiting to start walking. 

Individual groups may have special group tee shirts but most people will be wearing the CHOCWalk shirt they were provided at check in. 

People will be carrying signs with pictures of children on them. Signs with joyful messages about children who have been helped by CHOC and how long they've been healthy. Signs showing children in the midst of treatment with hopeful messages of support. Signs with much sadder messages about children who didn't make it. Even these are signs of hope that by walking they can help save other families from suffering the same loss. Some of the signs are much larger banners held across the fronts of large teams; of walkers.
 
There's a bandstand at the top of the street with Disney dignitaries, including Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Daisy, and Disney executives cheering people on as they are finally allowed to step off and begin their Walk. 

The Walk winds around both Parks, through most of the Lands, through some back stage areas and ends in downtown Disney. When you cross the plaza there are teams of high school cheerleaders cheering you on and all along the route there are cast members doing the same. There are even face characters sprinkled along the route to pose with and encourage the walkers. I've seen princesses riding the carousel, the three fairies on the castle, Buzz ightyear and/or Storm Troopers in Tomorrowland, Cowboy Goofy in FrontierLand, Red the firetruck in Carsland, Phineas & Ferb over by The Little Mermaid ride. More, really than I can recall.
 
Through all of that, the most amazing thing is the energy. All those people gathered in one place to make a difference in the world. The mood is buoyant. Hope, and dedication, and feeling good that here is a way that they can contribute and not just sit back and leave it all to the doctors. I don't know that I can adequately describe it. It's just amazing. 

Thanks to all of you I get to be there for the fourth time. Thank you so much for the donations and the reposting of the link. It is so appreciated!
 
I have reached 40% of my goal at $240. Can we make it to 50%? The link will follow in comments for those who are interested in helping with a donation. If you can't donate, or already have, please consider sharing this with your friends."

"event","We lost our sweet tortoiseshell M'lady Allannah Zevida Shinyturtle in May of 2012 due swiftly moving glandular cancer.  It made her unable to eat or drink and we had to make the decision to help her go. It devastated us.  I have never lived in a home without a cat, but my husband wanted time to grieve and I tried really hard to respect that.  I didn't succeed very well,  but I tried. 
In August of 2012 we saw an add from our local shelter saying they were adopting out cats for $25 dollars and that included spaying or neutering and  immunizations AND a very check up.  My husband finally agreed that we could get a new cat and off we went.  I was attached to the idea of another tortie or a polydactyl kitty since I grew up with them.  The shelter didn't have either.  My husband and I were debating whether to let it wait until a later date when I heard this scratching noise and looked down to find a black kitten in a glass front cage at floor level standing on her hind, legs scratching at the glass to get our attention!
We asked an attendant if we could hold her and she immediately started snuggling and purring and that was it.  She had chosen us and demanded to be taken home. The shelter's attending vet said she was all ready to go home having been spayed three days earlier.  The papers he gave us for her estimated get at 4 months old and,  counting backward we figure she was born the same week we had lost Lannah. The vet also started to make excuses for how shy she was which confused the hell out of us.  Turns out she IS shy and disappears every time anyone but my husband or I enters the apartment.  With us it's still all snuggles and demanding attention which we are all too happy to give her.  Today is the one year anniversary of the day Elspeth Arcana, a.k.a. Ellie, demanded to be taken home.  The first picture is from that day."

    But on the weekends I turn into something of a Magoo. I drive slow. I enjoy the day. Sometimes I make silly mistakes. 

 So today I pulled up to a light that was still green for another 2 seconds after I stopped. I don't know why I stopped early. Like I said said, silly mistake.  I decided to stay there since the light was changing to yellow by the time I figured it out.

 There's now a really pissed off woman with a dog in a little red car who not only had to gun her engine at me as she pulled around me in the wrong lane to make her right turn on red but when I pulled up adjacent to her at the next intersection turned, hand-gestured & must have been yelling at me as well judging by how wide her mouth was  flapping at  me.

All I can think is she is allowing some total stranger in a car an awful lot of power over her lovely Saturday afternoon."

"event","So. 
Most amazing moment of the con?
I have to pick between Broadway and Beyond and last night's Sherman/Menken concert. 

B&B was wonderfully dramatic and emotional as many of the songs were sung and acted by the people who sang them on Broadway. There were some very heavy songs. i.e. Easy as A Lie from Aida.

Last night. Less heavy stuff. Some duplication from B&B. All songs were sung by the men who wrote them. 

Richard Sherman. 
The man who, with his brother Robert, wrote the sound track of my childhood. 
Annette Funicello albums. Summer Magic. The Parent Trap. Winnie the Pooh. The Jungle Book. The Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room. Mary POPPINS!

Alan Menken
The Music of my Edison & Kaelie's childhoods. I guess you could call that the music of my Aunty-hood?

The Little Mermaid. Beauty & the Beast. Alladin. Enchanted. Hunchback of Notre Dame. Tangled. So many I can't call them all to memory, but also one I'm still obsessed with, and have passed the fascination down...NEWSIES!
(I've said it before but it can't be repeated enough: Disney, Please? Please please please PLEASE bring NEWSIES on a tour to the West Coast? A trip to New York just isn't in the financial cards. Please bring it to me? )

Most emotional moment last night? Richard Sherman singing Feed the Birds. You could have heard a pin drop. 

Alan Menken singing Santa Fe didn't bring tears to my eyes the way Josh Strickland did at B&B, but to hear the man who gave us that music sing it himself? Awesome. Only word I can come up with and ""awesome"" isn't an awesome enough word. 

But best moment?
At the end of the show Richard played It's A Small World, Alan sang counterpoint and the entire audience sang along.

I am looking forward to my 4th year of early morning walking thru DIsney Land, California Adventure and Downtown Disney. Between the special charachters greeting us along the route and the participants with their signs proclaiming who they honor as they walk, it's always a fun and moving experience!

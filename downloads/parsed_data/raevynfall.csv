"event","i never really know what to write in these things, cause i'm really rather a private person. there's seems to be an endless stream of things happening lately. Rather a roller-coaster effect...and to add to that i've been sick...(yeah whine whine)..not really a big deal, but it always takes so long to bounce back, because i have to do things regardless. last week the boys had soccer camp...i love being a mom...they were soooo cute. it was three hours a day, and the first two days i sat there with a 100.5 fever (managed with asprin)in 90+ weather watching. thankful that my dear boys saw to it that i had an ample supply of gameboy/zelda to pass the time. funny, i was the only mom that stayed, but that's just me, i don't want to miss things and i feel strange leaving my little ones. 

On another bit, i'm missing my friends...i've been so bad a keepin in touch, and i know some of them could really use a shoulder and ear. i guess i've had my share of 'things' going on, and haven't had much to give them. 

though things seem to be looking up, and recently i found an old friend and it made me smile. i'm always amazed at how life can twist and turn like this."

"event","All be it I haven't written in quite a while, and never really with much. There has been a flurry of activity on the home-front. Basically, ripping apart the old for the new. I can't wait for the new!! The process of remodeling a house is fun at first, and great after, but there is a bit of lag time between when things are suppose to arrive, and when they actually arrive. That's probably the toughest part. What is it they say 'keep your eye on the prize'."

"event","i never seem to have the time to do the things i want, yet i spend countless hours on projects with the intent that when they are done i can get to the things i really want to do.....somehow i keep having new projects (all be it of my own design)...it's a complex procrastination. what am i so afraid of?"

"event","It seems that the day to day issues we deal with require more deep breaths than they did when we were younger. DMV..stands for disrespecting my value."

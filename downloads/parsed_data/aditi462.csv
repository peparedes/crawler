Q: Did you check for breathing? 
A: No. 
Q: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the

A: No. 
Q: How can you be so sure, Doctor? 
A: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.

Event #1 sitting at dinner in a nice Japanese restaurant sipping cool raspberry Sake.
Discussion topic: Are all races equal? How racial discrepancies account for blacks' advantage in sports.
In times of slavery when blacks were brought over from Africa, they were sold to white men who had control over their very lives, and because they were bought mainly for work size made a difference. The larger stronger ones were worth more money, a financial bonus, for more work could be done.
When an owner of many slaves would decide to breed them, they would naturally pick the biggest/strongest male and the biggest/strongest female to breed together, therefore producing bigger/stronger offspring, worth more at the market or on their farms. This continued for many generations, one of the by-products of this little genetic control, of course, was inbreeding (genetic mutations and general mayhem). If you had good genes for strength within a certain family, why not use that to your advantage? At this time, blacks were not thought of as exactly human, so it never struck these owners that it was wrong to do that sort of interbreeding.
So today we have the descendants of these genetically manipulated slaves (not ALL of them, mind you) as part of a normal population, and the breeding of bigger/stronger produces athletic types, therefore giving black people a natural upper hand in athletics and sports.
The DOWN side to this, and the part that is going to bring me the most flak and drama, is that because of the selective inbreeding for certain traits and not others, the general population of blacks in America is startlingly less intelligent than the general white population. This would explain in part why areas of high black concentration in schools and such have lowered scores and higher crime rates, less employment and more social problems.
I want to make something clear here. I am NOT a racist, nor amd I in any way laying this out as an excuse. This is a fact that interested me and makes more sense than any other explanation I have heard.
Continuing on, the second part of this is Asian's natural preclusion to intelligence. 
As has been observed (and stereotyped) Asians are associated with hard work and innovation. We can relate the progress of any nation of people to its geographic locale and population growth. Asian countries have always been some of the most densely populated areas of the world, and in this state of high growth it stands to reason that some people would not have to work as hard as others to keep the family groups fed. In most countries/locales such as Africa the groups were much less concentrated and sparseley located, so more people had to forage and hunt for food to keep people fed. There was little to no time for activities that did not relate to survival. Therefore, energies were used for necessity and not much else. Asia had the advantage of being closely populated with larger groups of people so it took less of a group to keep the rest fed and safe, leaving more time for more people to develop other areas of thinking, such as technology and education. Simply put, there was more time to think of other things than food and shelter. Mental development.
Another reasoning for Asian development the way it has is geographical. Asian nations are mostly a sea-relating people. There is water access and therefore mostly a fish-based food supply and resource. They have been and to a good extent still are, dependant on fish. Scientifically, fish has been proven to stimulate parts of the brain to release certain enzymes that contribute to perception, cognitive processing, and memory. Hence, fish stimulates the learning centers of the brain and the more fish you eat the more you are opening your mind, in a sense. Smart Asians.

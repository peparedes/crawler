"event","Tonight is definitely about work.

I am now waiting for a conference call with my corporate headquarters in Connecticutt, at 9.15pm.

In exactly 1 week, I would have been in this company for 1 year - as a Customer Accounts Executive.... managing customer accounts and sales.

This company is majority owned by&nbsp;Pratt &amp;&nbsp;Whitney, which is part of UTC - United Technologies Corporation. The other partner is SIA&nbsp;Engineering Company. Commercial Engine Maintenance is a huge and blooming industry in Singapore, commonly referred to as MRO - Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul. 

Right at the core of the complex turbofan engine sits the Combustion Chamber - a donut-shaped space (the&nbsp;space is where the bread is)&nbsp;where Fuel and Air is ignited to create superheated gases. The company i work in specializes in repair and overhaul of the Combustion Chamber and the Fuel Nozzles (imagine the garden hose spray nozzle). My job is to market our specialized repair services to Airlines and Engine Overhaul Centers around the world.

Within 1 year in this job, I have had the opportunity to go the US twice, and to Europe once, to meet with current and potential customers. Business travel is a unique experience, with privileges of Business Class and 4/5 star hotels and fully claimed travel and food expenses, but a hectic 1-2 week schedule of country hopping&nbsp;and pressures of dealing face-to-face with new customers or difficult existing ones.

The cities I have been to in the US: - San Francisco (transit - California), San Diego (California), Atlanta (Georgia), Miami (Florida), Hartford (Connecticutt), Detroit (Michigan), Chicago (Illinois).

Other cities I have touched around the world: - Narita (transit - Japan), Frankfurt (transit -&nbsp;Germany), Hamburg (Germany),&nbsp;Stavanger&nbsp;(Norway), Zurich (Switzerland), Dublin (Ireland), Birmingham (England), Istanbul (Turkey), Hongkong&nbsp;(transit - China).


At last my call is finally over.... 10.36pm.... tired.... continue tomorrow..."

"event","GREAT!

Its only 10.57pm tonight.... I shall have a good hour if I concentrate :p
++++++++++++++++++
Ok greater still... its already&nbsp;11.30pm now....


If you must know, my dog of 8 years died early this year, while my family cat of 9 years died early last year (i think)...

So we survived on the company of plants and fish for a good while, but finally... Watami Elton was born into the home 2 weeks ago.

its a beautiful kitten, with a white body and a light brown head design and a fully brown tail like a real brush.
it was timid at first, but its curiousity has since turned him into a playful and sociable member of the family (so he feels)...
it was all good, until it pee-ed on my brother's shirt a few min ago... 
now he's got at least 1 enemy in the home... haha


So this means I probably update about my pets tonight.

PAST - PRESENT - FUTURE

Nacho was a mix English Cocker Spaniel for 8 years... RIP.... now he's probably a giant wolf chasing unwanted vampires out of dog heaven....

Misty was a true blooded Singaporean cat, at least for 9 years. if u read emily's blog, u probably know more about Misty than me by now...&nbsp; and for many more posts to come.

I also had a Silver Arowana for a year and a half... awesome prehistoric fish finally got a little too small for his huge 4ft tank... so i sold him for a $120... profit of $90.... pretty sound investment i believe.

I then got some nice Koi fish to fill the deserted tank, and fill it they did.... not with breeding, but with their size and activity... it entertains me till this day.... (only 2 have died since the beginning of the year... not too bad) ..... the two recent Parrot Fish additions have been audibly bullying Koi, so I am considering an indoor pond to better drown my 7&nbsp;Koi.

Elton is named after&nbsp;Elton John... duh. again, i'm sure (although i havent / don't read emily's&nbsp;blog) u know lots about this feline already.
Just for repeating sake, its a Ragdoll mix.... beautiful kitten, and going to be a stunning adult cat for sure. . . that is,&nbsp;if it gets its toilet habits 100% on target.

i still look forward to owning a Siberian Husky(ies), Beagle(s), Horse(s), and a Tiger (ok this has just&nbsp;got out of hand...) one day in the future.

God created animals for various reasons, and apart from eating them,&nbsp;interacting with humans was (i'm sure)&nbsp;in His plan from the very beginning when adam named the animals in eden..."

Even as i consider my plan to divide out my update into separate posts, my tired mind wanders absent-mindedly through the myriad of events, incidents, and episodes of the various categories.

I will use the next few days to update on the subjects introduced above (i just dozed off for a moment right after i typed &quot;update&quot;).... and will catch as much sleep as possible in the available hours left ahead."

"event","I was just reading through my old posts... and i realized maybe thats what blogs/journals are totally for - future reconsumption and appreciation.

Its great as a snapshot of the passing phases of one's dynamic life, which change as swiftly and certainly as the tide.

So. To create an accurate literary snapshot, I suppose I will recount my day's experiences, and thoughts (if any :D).

There's only so much one can do in 24 hrs... but i'm sure i maximized my alloted ration of time especially fully today. 

I awoke at 7.25am after a number of  false starts (namely 6.11am, 7.03am, and 7.15am).
This was due to my expectation of an early appointment with a customer, which was cancelled soon after i arose from my repose. Soon after i got up, my handphone alarms rang (7.30am)... I guess my body clock is a little ahead of time.

I left my house at 8.05am and fetched my ""little"" sisters to the MRT station at Bishan on the way to my office. Point of note for future reference: the previous night there were no available parking lots nearby, so i ended up parking in front of the car audio shop, past the bethesda child care (seemed like just 2 lots from the cemetery)... (oh parking lots i mean). So back to my point, I was only half awake while hauling my laptop and breakfast to my car, and the distance seemed particularly long to cover. Well, I should leave earlier to get to my car if it is parked so far away again... 

It was a considerably uneventful drive to the MRT. But I guess thats where the uneventfulness ceased for the day. (my goodness, this post is looking longer than intended)... (anyway who says u need to carry on reading! its for my own future consumption anyway haha)

I left bishan and turned towards Lornie, followed by PIE towards Jurong. The traffic flow on  PIE was heavier than normal today (but of course not as bad as the jam caused by the Trailer Accident!). The 'smarter drivers' know how to get through these regular congestions quickly... or rather, much quicker than everyone else. We take the extreme left lane, supposedly the slowest lane. But if u are familiar with Singapore road traffic mentality, u will realise that in heavy traffic, the slowest lane always moves the fastest. All because of Kiasu actually. So i swiftly got through past the speed camera, which obviously was not needed at all at this time, and approached the clementi exit. At this time, I was on the phone with my customer, describing some complicated steps in operating his instrument for his survey job. I guess he must have been really surprised when in the middle of my instructions, he must have heard a few jarring noises followed by a connection cut. This was nothing to do with the service providers signal strength... it was because of my rearview mirror. i had caught sight of the most feared entity on the singapore roads sweeping through the traffic behind me. Instinctively, my handphone flew out of my hand to the floor just as the Traffic Police glided past my window. whew. i didnt need such shocks to wake me up. and I definitely had enough for the day!

So anyway I called my customer back soon after i had confirmed the TP's departure from the vicinity.

I reached my office at 9am, discussed with my boss my intentions for the day, and left shortly after, bringing with me an instrument (GPT-7501) to Topcon to do a calibration. I exchanged that instrument with a GPT-6003 which i promptly brought to a customer at Nicoll Highway who is building that MRT station. At the road just before reaching my customer's site office (Nicoll Highway itself) there was another Traffic Police on the overhead bridge targeting the poor overworked souls who have to rush to make a living. (oh btw, if u rush through life, u'll finish first.) Two TP's in a day is already more than double one's tolerance of control or authority. U wouldn't belive my shock, after collecting my customer's damaged/dropped instrument, as I started off to Sentosa via ECP. YET another traffic police Wrx was parked along the expressway!! This time i was again on the phone, plus my seat belt was not or rather had not been fastened. immmediate correction of this condition was expedient, and once again, a customer was violently put on hold, for the life of my driving license.

OK i had better wrap up my 'snapshot' before i fall into heaven prematurely.

I got to sentosa cove... thats another story in itself, the beautiful houses and cars... anyway i met my customer who is building Oceanfront Condo to exchange a calibrated line laser equipment.

Then I bought a subway (cold cut trio 6 inch) for lunch, and thereafter headed to Topcon to deposit the damaged instrument and pick up the calibration instrument i had brought in an hour earlier I den went to Gul Drive in Tuas for a demonstration of the TOPCON Reflectorless Total Station (2pm. I was already hungry by this time ;p). After the positive demo of the instrument, which I will likely sell to him for about $15,000, I went back to my office in Jurong East where I trouble-shooted software problems till the official end of the working day (5.30pm). I fetched my colleague to the MRT station, and den went to school. 

Today's lecture was Company Law & Corporate Governance. Our lecturer went through review questions to prepare us for an upcoming Exam.

I reached home at 10pm feeling a severe need to de-stress. Luckily, my siblings were playing at Lor Ah Soo, where upon hearing their location, I promptly changed to sports attire and ran to meet them. Basketball.

Finally got home at 12.30am. oh my goodness its 2.30am now already. haha fortunately i'm not going to work tmr. My boss has graciously paid for my attendance of the National Achiever's Congress held at Expo, where world famous owners of personal success stories gather annually to share their tips for wannabes like the majority of us who pay to hang on their million dollar words...thats how they get more successful.

Anyway. thats the only reason why i'm still awake now. ridiculous. to stay up writing blogs. But den again, as introduced from the beginning, its for the sole purpose for future retrospect. so might as well compile it completely. Of course, this isn't complete, but there must be an end somewher"

"event","For ONCE, i'll try to put my day's reflections down on 'paper'....


WHY? because...

 1. I realised I've been rushing through life these past months, juggling many activities with a 5 and 1/2 day work week, without putting aside time to REFLECT. I understand the power of reflection. It helps you go through a day's events, analysing what went wrong/right and to learn from those experiences. I was forced to practice such during OCS (2-page a day A4 journal), and it greatly aided in re-inforcing learning. Unfortunately now that it is not compulsory, it tends to be de-prioritised among other 'exciting' / 'vital' activities... such as a glimpse into today may reveal.

2. Particularly today, because a number of events ensued which I would deem slightly out of the ordinary day's events, which triggered me to attempt such an arduous task as writing out 18 hrs of activity in one (web)page.


SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TODAY...

I woke up with a start. (That was unusual, esp without an alarm set) I looked at my watch, den at my clock on the wall. [0845 hrs] Within a split second of receding subconciousness, I realised I was late for work. (I have to be at office at 0845 hrs) First things first, I sent an sms to my boss, to inform him I would be late as I had overslept. Then I changed, got my car and drove it around to my house carpark to load up some instruments to bring to my office, before 'flying' off to jurong east. I got there at 0930 hrs. (Not bad) Its totally my fault for waking late, but it was great that my boss was not in to office yet as well, so there wasn't any uncomfortable introductions. Just for info, he later came in around 1015 hrs (he's the boss).

Reflection 1: No matter how late I sleep (around 2 am last night), if I need to wake up for an early appointment, SET THE ALARM.

I did a couple of things in office today, quite a few actually, considering I left at 1215 hrs. First, paperwork of sorting out previous day's, today's, and next week's delivery orders. Then, I completed the design and artwork for our company general catalog, and presentation folders. This includes photo-taking of the instruments, arrangements and designing on the computer software, boss' approval, and emailing to the printer (who happens to be my mom's brother-in-law). This was followed by some troubleshooting of a customers technical enquiry with my colleagues (namely my boss Victor, and a 57-yr old technician Mr Foo, whose identities shall remain hidden for corporate security). Point-to-Line, Edit-Measure, Layout Backsight/Backbearing, HSET, FS/SS.... 

I headed to my customer's work site opposite Bugis Junction to deliver some accesories ordered by the surveyor. This surveyor is a Christian, Methodist by denomination. He is very 'devoted', a fine example of close communion and fellowship with God. He is zealous to reach out to people around him, and relates God's leadings in his life to me whenever I meet him. Today was one such time. He had previously told me God had led him to tender his resignation. Today he happily informed him that God was merely testing his faith, and had given him the green light to stay on in the present construction company. He compared this trial with that of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac - he did not understand why God asked him to sacrifice such a good job. But leaving the reasoning to God, he prepared his resignation. Today, he had brought the letter to work, intending to hand it in to his boss. But when he asked God when was the right time to hand it over, God had answered him not to do so at all. Instead, to stay on in the job. Soon after this, his boss informed him of a bonus pay raise. He told me this, he said, because God wanted him to encourage ME. Our discussion moved on into how God wanted such close a fellowship with all His children, Christians. But how rarely do we see such? However, after certain past misrepresentations of God's leading in Christians, I am tempted to be skeptical. Does God actually lead His children so closely and intimately to this day? I believe he does, but only to those who allow Him to... such faith. How few we see today. 

Got home after the above-mentioned discourse at 1415 hrs, way overdue for lunch... and breakfast.(I had not eaten as I was in a hurry) Watched PROTEGE during lunch at home. DRUG addiction ruins/destroys lives. I highly rate this film, not for its morality (or the lack of it) but for the realistic truth it portrays to would-be drug addicts of lives in bondage to drugs.

I drove out again around 1600 hrs to fetch Mom and bro from UniSIM where they were touring a science lab, which they would be using for an upcoming homeschool project. Before picking them I had to pump petrol at SPC. After picking them I conducted a thorough cleaning of the inside of my 1.3L '91 Mitsubishi Lancer. (Poor overworked horse...wish...)

Yet again, I drive with my younger siblings to East Coast Park for a relaxation time. This is a popular weekend recreation hot spot (abit too popular. It was jammed.) for the mobile citizens of Singapore. We held discussions on a few topics, particular time consuming was the favorite names topic. I enjoyed the 'picnic' with 2 cannisters of potato chips, 2 bottles of iced tea (which tasted a bit like insecticide), my trusty bottle of water (code-named CLEO), and of course Kim, Em, and Ben. David joined us around 1930 hrs for blading, and this is where another extraordinary event took place.

As usual we glide over towards the Eastern end of the park, subconciously discussing various subjects. We turn back where the path ended, and started towards our start point. When we are tired, we perform a maneuver which (like the V-shaped Geese flights) lessens the energy consumption of the blading experience. This we call the CATERPILLAR. (Sounds and looks like ""Catch-the-pillar"" in front of u) Self-explanatory...I hope. Anyway here is THE event.

I fell.

Its complicated how it happened, and it took us the rest of the excursion (we were about half way back at the time of the descent) to analyse how IT exactly occurred and how IT could be prevented in the future (this also sparked my reflective mood).

I shall not start to attempt to lay out the descriptive analysis of the incident by witnesses from my rear.

First point noted: Upon entering an uphill, lower the CG of forward force to maintain even linear propulsion. 
Second: In case of collapse of formation, vector downward thrust 90 degrees from forward momentum.

SAFETY FIRST if u don't want what I got. Two scraped/grated/lacerated/bleeding knees. The sensation from my screaming nerves at the points of contact - its something I won't forget for a while.

Nevermind. Its all over now and I just have to move on *ouch!*.

OK just to round up my exciting Saturday. We ate at nearby Kallang KFC, practiced my Handbrake turns afterward at the open carpark behind the KFC (the sudden rain during dinner had nicely created a slick tarmac), and finally returned home at 0000 hrs.

Played with Ben some CS...

And took a bath *OUCH*...

And now here I stand (no, sit)(no, now lie)(no, now ...zzzzz)"

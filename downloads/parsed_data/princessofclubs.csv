I feel like we are all drifting apart, Holly I am very very very very sorry that Alyssa and I can't come to Wi. dells, we needed to go to band because state fair is less then a week away and we don't have any of it memorized yet.  We needed to go to this practice because we need to learn it.  I still think that you should come over to Alyssa's house considering that all of us do need to get together.  We would have soo much fun and I think that all of us need that once in a while.  Holly I am not shunning you out of my life and niether is Alyssa, so don't feel like our friendship is gone.  Just think about comming over after you're done with Wi. Dells.

Your friend forever

"event","**Today sucks first off I found out that we had school which really sucked in my part because I wasn't feeling real great this morning..Then my mom told me that like Joe didn't  have school today and that sucks because I wouldn't be able to see him at all or whatever**

**Today when I finally made it to school it was raining, so my hair like freaked out on me, and that really sucked, and it was icy..I almost felt like Sweets when she's so causious with the ice..it was slippery..lol..When I got into the school I immeadiitly got a fn hot flash and it sucked, because I was like sweaty and stuff, and it just realy sucked**

**When I got home to my surprise was Joe still in the shop YAY! for me..so like I was talking to Karl and stuff about school because Joe was busy and like we were talking about GPA's and stuff and how his average for all 4 years was like a 1.4 and like we were laughing and then he said that he graduated with a 4.0, I was all like hey that's pretty kool and stuff and then here comes Joe and is like ""Bull-Shit you did not"" and all like this mocho stuff..it was funny.  So I go into the office after all of this and like my mom is like you can either clean the sink or you can vacume and I'm all like ""i'll clean the sink"" so I went in there and like I was cleaning it and here come Joe and I said hi and stuff and then Karl comes in and like he's washing his hands..and like I'm telling them to like keep the soap in the sink not on the counter and stuff, and then after that we were talking about dogs and like how big we've seen, so then I'm like ""ya my friend Alyssa has a Alaskan malamute"" (or w/e) and like how big it is, and then here is Joe with this dumb ass comment saying ""oh you have friends?"" and i'm like ""that was mean"" and I'm looking at Karl and he's like ""hey I would have said the same thing""..but like was he being a jerk about it..or like being flirty, or just fn dumb..w/e**

**I went and saw the play and it was actually really good, and your never gonna believe this but Sabrina was actually really good, like her singing sucks but like her acting ability was really good like she really knew what she was doing..it was kinda cool, but sssshhhh..I didn't tell you that..**

**See you ladies tomarrow night sometime good night**"

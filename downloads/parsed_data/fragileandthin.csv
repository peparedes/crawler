"event","Sometimes it seems like the basic job human beings have is to figure out what the hell is going on. Example: Gretta Milano. What was she hiding? What was she afraid of? Why did she end things so abruptly? And her final words, ""Go with God,"" what did they mean? One never knows...down to the smallest thing. The man who catches your eye in the street; does he know you? Did you go to high school together? Or is he a stranger? Is he a homicidal maniac who hates your guts on sight, or is he thinking about robbing you, or is he just some poor creature trying to make a homosexual advance? Or was it nothing, nothing at all?"

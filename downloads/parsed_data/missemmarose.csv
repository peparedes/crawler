"event","Okie dokie, I will post a little bit for now...

So, last night was the Dir En Grey concert at St. Andrews Hall. Everything was going well; Jon and I were pretty much on schedule with everything. Jon picked me up and we went to CVS to get some foundation/powder stuff and black eyeshadow since there wasn't any good red eyeshadow. It took us like 15-20mins just to find those two things. I hate makeup! Ahhh!

Then we stopped back at my house to get the rest of the eyeshadow I forgot to bring in my bag of goodies. And I also grabbed my black and white striped shirt. Then we headed back to Jon's house to get ready.

We got to his house and started with our hair. I was going to try to make mine kind of spikey, but I am no expert in the hair department! I brought all of my hair goodies (hair glue, gel, wax, fiber gum, and hairspray). I started by wetting my hair and then applying the glue and attempting to work it through. Jon was eager to help me, so I let him! lol. It just wasn't working, so I tried making my hair less wet and blow dried it some. That didn't work. So, I just washed my hair and did it sort of messy instead of spikey. My hair was not my friend that day, for sure. Jon straightened his hair. He had to have it perfect, like always! lol. Love him!

Next, the makeup. Jon wanted to do his makeup just like Die's makeup. Here's a picture:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/missemmarose/pic/0000f1r9/""><img width=""174"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/missemmarose/pic/0000f1r9/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a>

<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b377/VampiressEm/DIR%20EN%20GREY/diemybloggi.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

Yes, Die is gorgeous! He's my favorite! *Tee hee* Anyway, Jon wanted his eyes like Die's. I was hoping to do that too, but decided not to because it would probably look like I got punched in the face. So, I just did my eyes my way and they turned out really pretty. Yeah. Jon caked on his black eyeliner and eyeshadow and I said ""Uhhh, Jon...."" and he replied ""I am working on it! I gotta put a lot on and smudge it."" I then continued on my makeup after saying okay. I got mine done and Jon got his done. Then he went out in the living room and his mom told him to take some of the makeup off. After he did that, it looked much better.

We got out tickets, coats, gloves, and directions and headed out. His mom told us not to take anything from anything (foodwise). She said she knew that we knew this, but it was her responsibility as a parent to tell us that. So, we said okay and headed out. Everything was fine. It was 4:30pm and we went to Taco Bell to get some food. Then we were on the freeway.

We were really excited and so we were listening to Dir En Grey CDs on the way. We got to the parking lot across the street and locked the doors after we got out. We walked across the street to get in line, then Jon realized something....He locked the keys in the car! I asked him where the heck he could have left the keys and he said ""In the ignition."" I said ""You ass!"" and laughed. We asked the guys that were in charge of the lot if they had a jimmy or something and they didn't. Jon tried the Roadside Assistance, but he didn't know what to do and hung up. Then he called his mom. Eventually his parents said they would bring us the extra key.

While we waited for about an hour, the guys let us stand in their little hut by the heater. One guy was a kid (16) and the other was an older man. They were really nice, although the man talked so fast and with an accent I couldn't really understand him much. But Jon and I talked to the kid. He was nice. Finally, his parents got there with the key and we told them that the guys let us stay in their hut to keep warm. Then she tipped them and said thank you. Jon and I shook the kid's hand because we didn't know where the other man went and we said thank you very much. Then we walked across the street to stand in line. It was after 6:30pm and that's when the doors opened.

We had to stand in line for about 45mins and it was sooooo cold. I wore my converse shoes and they got wet and my feet froze. Not fun. I said that was the last time I wait in the freezing cold for any band. I could hardly walk by the time we got to the doors, I kept losing my balance and had to hold on to Jon. It hurt so bad. While we were in line though, there was this lady (I think she might have been homeless) and Jon was trying to keep me warm and we were like hugging or whatever. The lady said ""Now that's true love."" Then we laughed and stopped. She said ""Now, don't stop just because I said something."" lol. It was funny, she was really nice. I mean, why are some people so mean to homeless people? There are some really really nice people out there that are homeless. Just be kind to them, don't act like they aren't there. They are people. Okay, done ranting about that.

Finally, we got inside! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! We had to wait in a little bit of another line to get out tickets checked and then we got frisked. Oh yeah, frisked. I was wearing my chain wallet so I could have it hooked to me. The woman told me that I couldn't have it. So, I asked could I get it back? And she said ""No, if you give it to me, you will not get it back. You can either give it to me or take it to your car, if you want."" So I just gave it to her. I lost my freaking chain for my wallet. Ahh, oh well. I didn't lost the wallet, or my skull belt! Jon told me the guy put his hands somewhat down his pants. Jon said ""I would have liked a heads up and I didn't know they were gonna shove their hands down my pants."" And I told him that I didn't think they were supposed to...we will never know. Then  we went in.

First we bought some merchandise. I just bought a Dir En Grey tour shirt and Jon bought a Dir En Grey dog tag, sticker, and tour shirt. Then we waited for the show to start. Oh, did I tell you it was a general admission show? Yes, it was. Oh and I forgot to mention the two girls we met in the line. Their names were Rachel and Ashley. They were really nice. We tried to stick with them the whole night, but we all got separated. That happened after the first band 'Fair to Midland' and Dir En Grey was getting set up. I even got separated from Jon. He wasn't too far from me though.

When Dir En Grey came out, everyone screamed and I screamed and cried. I was so happy that they were finally up. Die (guitarist) was nearest to me. I was in awe and pretty much stared at him like half of the night. Yeah. lol. And they had these fan things blowing on their faces (Die and Kaoru) and their hair was blowing. Awesome. Kyo (vocalist) was freaking amazing too. He was so insane! Not a surprise, but I actually got to see him in action LIVE. He ripped out a couple of his teeth and let the blood trickle down his mouth and onto his bare chest. He is one fine looking man. lol. And he did these faces and smirks and it was like ""Ahhhh KYO is so hot!"" Yeah. He scratched his chest a couple of times too. It was awesome. Shinya is such a cutie, he is the drummer. He so quiet and when they were getting ready for the show to start, he was sitting there and he looked kind of lost or timid. It was so cute! I didn't really get to see Kaoru(guitarist) and didn't see Toshiya (bassist).

So whilst Dir En Grey were playing, I got shoved up closer to the stage. It was awesome yes, but I was pinned between people the entire night basically. And my right arm was pinned behind me half the night and my left arm was on my chest because I couldn't move. So, other than being pinned between people, people basically grinding on me (not on purpose), people's sweat and hair all over me, and someone using my head as an armrest because they couldn't put it down, I had a fun time. I got to see Dir En Grey LIVE and I could see for most of the night.

So, I told you everything I remember. If I remember more, I will add it. And I just realized, I said I would share a little at the top, but ended up with the whole story. lol.

Love,

Emma Rose

"event","Okay, so I made this freakin' LiveJournal and I don't even think anyone views it. I get no response, nothing. Eh, whatever, I guess I have this more for me than anyone else. I don't know why I am getting so worked up over it. It's like a journal for me, so that I don't have to write everything down. I like the typing more. I don't know...I just thought it would be nice to have this LJ for people to see how I am feeling and what's going on in my life, explaining why I act the way I do. But I don't even think half or any of my friends have one of these LiveJournals anymore...it's so ancient I guess. What's the more ""live"" blogging/journal site other than freakin' myspace? I don't know! Whatever, I'm done ranting.

So, I made a LJ account in probably middle school. I didn't know how to really use it, so I just never came back to the site again. I figured since I am more ""internet"" saavy and all I would give it another try. For right now, I am going to be posting previous ""blogs"" from my myspace. Then when more events happen or I want to be random, I can post new. Anyway, that explains what I want to do right now. Maybe I'll have more luck with this LJ experience this time.

"event","wow. look at all of this drama. ok, finally i am going to come clean to ryan, stephen, and lea each person sepaarately about everything. i want everything straight. this may hurt some of you, this may not hurt you at all. but it will probably make me more at peace with myself. i want to let you know how i really feel. 

to ryan : to clear some things up... yes i tried to keep you from your friends around the time we were first together. i'm not going to deny this. i was young and i was jealous because i didn't know how to balance my friends and you all at once. i was jealous because every friend i had i gave up for you. i guess i wanted the same back. i was so used to being the center of your universe that once i wasn't anymore, it hurt. sometimes you'd leave me at home by myself and go out with your friends, i would have done the same but i didn't have anyone but you. i was clingy and needy. i understand i was wrong later when i had learned the error of my ways, and i didn't do this anymore. 
for a while i had been searching for someone to take me away from you. i grew tired of breaking up and making up. yes, i kissed other people, yes it was wrong to do to you, and i'm sorry. i figured if i just found that one person to get me out of our endless cycle- someone to take me away- it would be less painful to have to get away from you myself. dont get me wrong, i tried to get away on my own, i guess it was either too hard or i just wasn't strong enough. 
finally i found that person, yes i kissed him while we were together. that just kind of happened... i didn't just leave you for him. i left you for me, too. and i'm sorry i hurt you so badly about it.
if i ever thought you friends were assholes, its because they probably were. i dont ever remember thinking that about james, brian, stephen, tj or lauren. but people such as brad, kyle, and daniel? they were assholes. they constantly said rude things to me right in front of you, and you didn't even stick up for me most of the time. 
also, i know i've gotten an apology from you. but you really need to stop posting my personal life in comments or entries. think about how all those things lots of people never knew about until you said something. its nothing to get back at me with. whether or not it's common knowledge is no reason to inform the world about it. i dont hate you, ryan. i never have or will. i still love you. and i'm sorry i hurt you as badly as i did.

to stephen : when i met rob, yes i started hanging out with him every day. i started ignoring you, or not speaking. i started changing. and i was wrong for that. i'm trying to get back to where i was and it is so hard. i wish you were still here. i miss you. some of the smartest advice i ever had was from you, and i miss you being there to give it to me. it was wrong for me to drop you and pick those people. if i knew things would have been this way i would have maintained a better balance. as long as we can have back what we had before, i will be very happy. :) i love you stephen, more than you will ever know. you're one of my best friends. and those aren't plentiful.

to lea (scott & austin): ok. well i started hanging around you because i liked rob. i was ok with not doing the whole drug thing, and i thought you were so awesome. you were so nice to me. and i really appreciate how comfortable you made me feel when i first entered your circle of friends. i loved hanging out with you, it was a lot of fun. i enjoyed the good old days when leigh was still around. it was just easier then. 
i always wanted a time with rob i could actually spend the whole day with him without you being around. and i've never had one like that. everytime rob and i would have a ""date"" there would be lea, scott, and austin afterwords or lea, scott, and austin before. sometimes it would be both before and after. and that wasn't cool for me. i just wanted a boyfriend, not a boyfriend (friends included). dont get me wrong i liked spending time with you, but it stressed rob and me out all the time. i would get so upset because we couldn't spend time together. we would never have more than an hour alone before someone was there wanting to do some drugs, or play some music, or get drunk. and it was terrible for me to have to deal with it. then be attacked for being upset because, i really didn't have much of a reason to be upset since ""bro's before ho's"" was your circle's motto. while rob was gone, scott would sit there and tell me ""you know he's not thinking about you right now, i dont even want to hear that you're thinking about him too. you know what he's probably going to do in las vegas. dont be stupid."" 
it seems like there was a petition against us from the start, and it felt like rob listened to you more than he listened to his heart. that hurt more than anything. and the sexual innuendos scott always made to me, trying to get in my pants. his ""best friend's girlfriend's"" pants. wow, what a wonderful friend. my self esteem was so low, and i felt like shit about myself. i stopped going over there for a while, and i felt so much better about myself. i felt like i was actually worth something. it sounds bad, but its the truth. 
when rob and i broke up, i was clueless. come to find out, it was partly your circles fault. you are the ones who told him to leave me, you are the ones who tried to be there for me when you were the one that slit my throat and caused me so much pain. rob listens to you because you were supposed to be his best friends. if he only knew... 
for a month, i felt worthless, unloved, i wanted to crawl in a hole in die. mostly because of you. and then, look at the way you treat rob? you have parties with his parents, at his house, while he's not home and don't even mention it to him, you leave him when he needs you the most, you dont keep in touch hardly at all. of course he's going to think you dont give a shit, why? probably because YOU DONT!
you just want someone to go down the drain with you. i suppose its not enough to just go down with three people. after all who wants a third wheel? and i suppose it isn't enough to get your life straightened out, and get on the right track. the one you will succeed in. but that honestly never was my problem. you wonder why i care so much about your business with rob? because first of all, I'M the one there picking up the pieces when you hurt him, I'M the one that cares for him. and i'm just tired of both of us hurting because of you. it was fun times till life gets serious, now its serious, and you seem not to care as much as he does. which separates the men from the boys, in the long run."

tonight i have the football game. its supposed to be forty degrees at kickoff. and if you've seen the uniforms we wear, they're halter tops, and thin pants... :( i'm going to freeze my ass off tonight boys and girls. ashley says thats what you get for being eye candy. i'm about ready to quit danceline. i've already been honored on senior night. the only thing i want to do that keeps me there is choreograph the tryout routines. if i cant do that then i quit. plus i hate how cold it is out there. :\
i'm going to get dressed soon. rob and i are having words. i hope we'll be ok. i <3 him.

I think I'm getting better about my capitalization and punctuaion and such for some odd reason. Rob's stepped out for a little bit, I've been kind of ignoring him today and I dont mean to. I'm just very sick & sore. He just called. I'm in love with him. If you'd like to see a picture of my preppy potential again-boyfriend & Watson... here they be is!

I guess I should tell you about my day, I woke up this morning, so awfully tired. I didn't want to get up at all. I just threw my hair up, threw some clothes on and walked out the door. I got to school to find out that I was in Coach Gill's class this morning, instead of Mrs. Yawn's. I went in there and did some dumb worksheet on Logarithms. I had my calling at about 9:15 while reading a newspaper that was given away by Coach Gill. I read an article and an advertisement about a Day Spa and botique opening up in Thomaston. Its called Susannahs. There is one open all week days in Barnseville. I'm SO there for a full body massage, facial, and potential pedicure.
After that I went to art, I was really agitated in there. Then came lunch, Kevin (the gorgeous guy from Penn?) was sitting at my table today. He kind of annoyed me, just because I was in a ""I feel annoyed mood"". He kept pinching my fat and poking me.. It was SO godawfully annoying. I have this phobia of eating infront of people that I dont know, especially when they're not eating anything either, so I didn't eat lunch because he was there. Anyway... I could barely stay awake in German. I think that is when my aderol quits working. I made a log and a half for our German project that is Due Thursday. I suggested the idea about a school sabbath, but I dont think anyone was listening. Like always. Newspaper came, I worked all period, BY MYSELF on the Ads. I do have to say Bethany Delli-Gati did a wonderful job watching, and Heather helped a little by scratching my back and reading off information to me. I finished them all by myself. *Sigh* Anyway. I printed out my football story, and wham, I was ready to go home. 
When I got home, I chilled for most of the day, and fell asleep after a big dinner. Slept till 8 o'clock. When Sara's mom called me about Humane Society stuff... That's just another thing I have to take care of. *Sigh* I still have to post the pictures of the floats for you guys. It was neato. :) But in other news, I believe that this was a very GOOD journal update, and I will go now.

Fucking off!

"event","wow. tonight, well, it was ok. i'm thinking about someone special <3... :) and... i'm home. my grandfather is visiting. i dont get to sleep in my room for as long as he's here. i get the couch. how about that? ugh.. anyway. i wont stay home much this week anyway. it will consist mainly of getting trashed and sleeping over at someones house. homecoming rocks. i'm very excited. finals are next week too, and that so sucks balls. 

festival is tomorrow, i think that will pretty much suck. we're leaving at 9:00 in the morning and we're getting home at 12:30... performing around 2:00 in tifton... i dont know where that is, or how long it will take to get there. i try not to think about it. but atleast i will have my ashew by my side to help me through the hard times of the trip, and all the morons who are going on it with us. it sucks being the cool people. :( . so anyway, like i said i'm thinking about that special someone in my life. i wish i could talk to him. he's out doing... whatever... with friends. i hope he comes home and gets online and such. it would make my night. 

the performance at the game, we (btw) won, was awesome. i think it was my best one. although i was SO out of breath at the end because i did the whole thing full out. my high kicks aren't as high as they used to be. may as well practice for tomorrow. then we wont have practice as much. i get to choreograph the senior routines too, for senior night. 

after the game i went to scotts & met lindsey there, because there were promises made. but the promise was broken when we wound up sitting outside, in the cold, mind you! michael, scooter, billy, and eric rode up. they left again, and lindsey and i pretty much said, fuck this... and left. i have to get some rest anyway. on the couch. 

that special someone makes me smile all over, he is the sunshine in my sky, and all that corny shit. we're anteloping. :) and having kyttens. :) lol.

*sigh* my past couple of days have seemed so unreal. i feel like i've died and just lived through it at some point or another. *confused face* i dont know. i dont want to make this long, so i'll say good night! fucking off

<3 xoxo <3
love to my ho's
love to my baby
love to my best friends

today has consisted of mainly doing absolutely nothing but chatting online, stuffing my face, and getting gas for my car. its been dull, i'll say. but i redyed my hair. it looks pretty good, too.. same color though. i'm impressed because i actually did it myself. :) 
i'm waiting for rob to come back, and i'm talking to jazmine. i have to get a camera from mrs. austins room so i can take some black and white photographs with jazzybelle at the r.e. lee cemetery. but i have to develop the ones i have already done first. it has to be the prettiest cemetery there is. i'm thinking about gothing up too and getting a photo op for myself as well! 
i hate being on pseudo restriction, it's put me and my mother on edge a lot... i get so annoyed because i cant go anywhere, we had it out because i wanted to go get gas for my car this morning. it doesn't help that mrs. yawn e-mails my mom everytime i take my eyes off of her in class. and she fails to mention all the good things that i do. and i do more good things than bad things. i suppose i'll go now. i've had my fifteen minutes of fame. :) fucking off."

"event","Is it worth it can you even hear me
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I'm tired and I felt it for awhile now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free

So here I am it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this

And won't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there to so you can see
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
And we'll drink and dance the night away

As long as you're alive
Here I am
I promise I will take you there"

anyway, i did have fun tonight when i rode through the ghetto with whitney and ashley (colorguard girls). it was fun. i felt like i was "" down "" with the flow. lol. we played rap music really loud and had lots of fun. i went to the tailgate party, it was fun too. i didn't do the danceline thing, because i'm rebellious. and a black sheep.

then during the kickline, my shoe came off. i was right on the forty yard line. omg... and i was wearing my black and white striped stockings. it was really great. let me tell you about it... ugh... it was funny though. i guess that piled on top of everything else made everything suck. 

i told kevin (this really gorgeous guy from penn. that moved here last year) i'd call him tomorrow, he's really cute. he's sweet too. i think he's a bit of a charmer, too charming to be exact. i really dont have much to worry about since i'm really not in the mood to be a girlfriend anymore, but i'm watching myself. i really dont think i'll let myself fall in love again. it just hurts too much.

anyway, my friend bacardi and i are going to go now. maybe pass out. bai."

"event","I pressed my face against the glass,
smiled as my breath made some pattern or other
The world beneath unfurled before me like a sail,
glinted in gold from this rich dawn sky
Awaiting the ship they had told me would come,
quietly anticipating that which was to come

I couldn't yet see you. Still obscured by the city
A towers of glass reflected your coming
Silhouetted on the sunrise
Did I blink as I watched? Did I close my eyes?

I was not alone, I think it was the first time
Watching you rise splendid and graceful,
I cheered as you sailed, a greatness unknown
I laughed as I waved and imagined you saw me
In the streets of the city, the windows of buildings,
a million faces gazing upwards in wonder
A million faces together and cheering and smiling
You were the warmth of their hearts, you were the sum of their dreams
In the coldness of morning you brought warmth to their lives
giving this feeling of wonder I could not imagine
You unlocking these thoughts no book and no picture could ever convey
This feeling and morning had opened a door.
I stepped into a new world I watched you fly
Saw you as a friend, the spirit of dreams
I imagined a new world, lands far away,
imagined those faces as you hung in their sky

I'm leaving ground stepping into a new world.
I'm leaving ground, a new world. And watching you fly
I stepped into, I stepped into a new world
I was not alone, I think it was the first time

I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
Now I'm leaving home, leaving everything
I step into this new world leaving everything

I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
Now I'm leaving home, leaving everything that I have ever known
I step into this new world leaving everything

Leaving everything, leaving everything."

i went to the hannahs mill store and robs dad was there, and robs dad got me some gas... :S he didn't have to do that! lol, robs dad is sweet, he was telling me that he loved me and missed me being around, aw... that made me feel so much better after being left in thomaston. lol. then he said he noticed rob and i going two different ways a couple weeks before he left, and he was like, its ok though, i had these friends that broke up during college, and 11 years later, they were married and have been together 26 years. i was like... AWWW! thats so sweet... ah. anyway. nuff about that. imma go... i'll update later. mom and i are going to see a movie tonight. yay! maybe stop by barnes and nobles. book time! *shakes it fast*"

"event","am i a human? sometimes i debate that... i mean, i live, breathe, i speak english, i think i am pretty smart. i dont get why i am treated like a piece of ass a certain person. being hit on is flattering at times, but then it gets to the point where it's hurtful, and degrading. i'm tired of being a sex object... an accomplishment, a goal to reach, and it hurts.

rob's off doing his own thing and probably doesn't care that i need someone to talk to, because i cant post it here. i asked if i could talk to him later, he said ""he'd try his best"" ""busy night"".... then that's the last thing he said to me... i'm glad he's adjusting well. i love him. 

i got my nails redone today, it was great, i messed them up on the way to scotts. saw andy, michael, brandon, adam, and scott... overall it was exhausting. i need to go to bed... because i'm just really tired of today. i have a quiz tomorrow in alg/trig, over something we just learned... can we say, ""i think i'm going to bomb that shit""... something about a + bi... or something... wtf?

"event","well well... how's it hangin guys? i guess my life is ok, but, i feel so lonely. i miss rob a whole lot. today its really gotten to me how lonely i am. i mean, not to the point of tears yet, just... thinking about ""woah, he's gone, i hope he loves me"". i see all these couples on tv, maybe just a silly little authritis commercial about two couples talking about authritis... and shoot me, but i want that. i guess its only human to want to be happily married, with cute little kids. or whatever. i mean, please dont comment and say ""oh you're so young, you aren't ready for that""... i can dare to dream. 
you know, i just want to have everything planned out, i want to know what will happen when, and i cant wait to get every obstacle jumped.... i just want to hurry up and get to the part where i live... you know, i can live on my own, pay my rent, live in the city... you know, i am even afraid of that. i'm just confused... i want to have everything taken care of, but i know i'm not even ready for that. i know none of this even makes sense, but bear with me. 

today i went to school, the band took individual and group pictures after school, so i had to be there... danceline sucks this year, i dont like it. i liked last year better. but anyway, i took ash & jenna home, and then went to scotts, hung out there, came home because i didn't feel good. went to a band boosters meeting my mom made me go to, and went to get some chillis to go, and came home and ate. i was supposed to be doing my homework (big trig test tomorrow), but i told my mom to just wake me up early. *shrugs* i'm a piece of shit. no... really, i am a piece of shit. 
i <3 rob.... and all my friends!

i saw rob for 5 minutes yesterday, didn't see him the day before but saw him 10 or 20 the day before that. he's so busy, but i understand that. its funny thought how he has time for austin, lea, and scott, but none for me. i guess its the way it goes. i guess its the reason why i'm never invited anywhere with them anymore. i dont see why they're leaving me out! i have been the best friend in the world to him, i care and i'm not selfish, but i guess none of that matters."

i have to go to school today. i dont want to. i just threw up... i cant hold much down anymore... after saturday night i just cant hold food down like i used to... probably because i've been so upset lately.

"event","i'm not even quite sure what to think anymore. i called scott on my way out to see where he was, and if i could talk to him. (made sure rob wasn't there) he told me to come over there because he wanted to talk too.. when i got there the driveway was full, and guess who's car was over there? hellz yes... robs... i was so angry at scott because i thought it was just him. so i talked to scott, and he brought rob out there.... i really didn't like that. i got attacked like i knew i would be, and i should kick the shit out of myself for even THINKING i could talk to him. 

so i talked to scott, and i had to ""realize some things"", i was being selfish because i wanted his full attention... hm. i never wanted his full attention, infact, i would have been pleased to even get ten percent of it that night. the longest he ever spent around me is when i finally bedded his ass down... so anyway... finally after i talked to scott and quit listening to the same redundant statements.... i had him call rob out there. shit is straight i guess... i'm still very angry... and very heartbroken. 

but it wasn't 5 minutes after he got out there, everyone was leaving, so that means that i had to leave too. they were going (of course) to robs. and i really didn't want to go over there. so i left, still edgy. i dont think i have ever been this constantly sad for a long time. infact, i dont think i've ever been this hurt before.

so i left, drove to stephens. i stayed over there till 9 o'clock and i came home. stephen worked miracles on me, and actually talked to me like i was a human being. that made me feel so special... he made me feel like i was important, and that i deserved more than that. i'm still debating on what is good for me, and i know deep down what i should do. but i'm so scared of it.  

so here i am, after channel surfing, after a soda and chips, after all... i'm still upset, hurt, and bleeding internally. i hope that things get straightened out, because... i'm so heartbroken. i still cant believe all this shit happened. i still cant believe that i have (all day - mind you) been searching for someone to make me feel better. i guess i've completed that. i guess i feel a little better than i did before... better than crying till i threw up... 

ok rob just called, i answered, and we had a great conversation... so much better than all of them in the past 24 hours. maybe things are looking up? only time will tell..."

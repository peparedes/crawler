well, i guess that's all for now. things are going well with seth and me. i love him, he loves me, and i believe he trusts me a lot at this point. i've learned that trust doesn't come easily. i won't be letting him down again. 
hm...seems i covered an entry and an announcement all in one. talk to ya later...if you're my friend that is."

"event","hey fellas. i just had a very nice Easter. i went to church, ate ham, and watched an interesting movie. i'm going to give seth his Easter present tomorrow. i hope he likes it! i would say what it is, but then he would end up reading this and finding out! this year, i want it to be a suprise. 

anywho...there's not much going on at my house right now. zach's playing DDR, mindi's out, mom's upstairs in her room, and i'm fooling around on the computer, obviously.

you know, Easter always reminds me of when i got saved. i was sitting in church on my mom's lap. then, when the preacher stopped preaching, i started crying. it was on Easter evening, and i had just heard him tell the story of Jesus being killed. it made me so happy to know that He loved me so much to die for me, and i wanted Him to know that i loved Him the same way for his compassion. so i gave my life to Him. since then, i haven't always been the best Christian i could be, but i guess it's times like these that you think of how hard we should try to be the best we can be. thank you Jesus!!!"

"event","seems that someone is mad at me. i won't use names, but this person has been one of my best friends for a while now. she and i have been really close too. but despite this ""friendship"", i would suppose that she hates me now. sure i guess i haven't been a good friend 24/7, but i try to give everything i can and help as much as i can. i couldn't make it to her birthday jazz last week. maybe she's mad at that. but i had softball, and i ended up quitting anyways. dumb coach, but that's besides the point. i guess we haven't been that close lately though...with her life going on and my life busy since my dad comes home for weekends, it's hard to be able to do anything friendship wise. but maybe i'm not a good enough friend for her. when she needed me, i was there as much as i could be. when she was upset, i tryed my best to make her stop crying. i'll admit, i didn't have as many problems in my life as she had, but i tryed to give the best advice i could. maybe i didn't stick up for myself enough. maybe i stood up too much. maybe i just lost one of my best friends. if you read this, you know who you are. i still have your birthday present. i hope you like it. i'm not mad, but i am sad. a friend is one of God's most precious gifts. maybe he decided to take this gift away from me? who am i to ask? but who am i to know?"

anywho, not much else has happened today. i quit softball yesterday to those of you who don't know. i can't believe coach mabry sat me out for the whole double header. i still can't get that thought out of my head. i have never in my life been the kid who stood around in the duggout walking around the pole. i was the pole kid! ugh. softball means so much to me. i have spent hours out on the field. for years. i can still remember the first time i played. i was scared, and not exactly the best one on the team, but i stuck with it and look where it got me. well, you couldn't tell much from spring valley's team, but i will be playing softball, you can bet on that. but enough of my blabbing on about that. 

i guess i'll shut up now and play guitar. to those who care, love ya!"

i had practice forEvEr after school today. i'm really tired, but at least i get to play on varsity. that's a step forward! oh! i wrote a song.(and this time, i actually put music with it too) check it out:

(i don't have a name yet)

darkness seeps into the light.
it captures my memories 
and casts its shadow on my wall.
i stumble through the night.
i can't hear your voice,
and i can't see anything at all.

why have you left me?
where have you gone?
i've been waiting here so long.
how can i find my way home?

it's getting colder now,
as my breath turns white.
everything's losing it's shape.
there is no light.

where have you been now.
you said you would be there
to hold my trembling hand.
but now you are not here.
do i have the strength to even stand?

just then the dust clears,
and there's a dim light.
and in that dim light, woa.
i see you in all your glory and might!

you haven't left me.
you haven't gone.
you've been right here the whole time.
now i have stregnth to go on!

i'm going slightly mad-Queen(who else??)

When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh oh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad
Oh dear! ha ha ha ha 
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened uh huh
It finally happened I'm slightly mad - oh dear!
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast its true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad!
Just very slightly mad!
And there you have it!

"event","Teen in sticky spot after Milk Dud stunt

By CINDY F. CRAWFORD
Staff Writer

PORT ORANGE -- Luke Porto bit the Milk Dud in half and eyed the remaining chunk of gooey chocolate-covered caramel.

The 15-year-old freshman at Father Lopez High School could have finished it off. He could have thrown it in a trashcan.

But he chose another path that November day, prompting a chain of events that has landed him in juvenile court.

Luke's choice was to throw the candy out the window of his mother's moving car, hoping to get a chuckle out of his 4-year-old brother. A passing motorist claimed the hurled hunk hit her windshield and cracked it, causing $250 in damage.

Now Luke faces criminal mischief charges and state attorney-ordered arbitration later this month.

""He was goofing around,"" said his mom, Lenora Porto. ""He wanted to see how high he could throw it. He didn't (hit the car) on purpose.""

The other driver, Diane Bering of Port Orange, didn't find it funny at all. After seeing the candy hit the windshield of her minivan, Bering, who was driving the opposite direction of the Portos on Commonwealth Boulevard, turned around and pursued the family to a meat market on Nova Road.

""It scared the life out of me,"" the real estate agent said. ""I thought it was a rock. . . . I could have swerved and hit someone over a Milk Dud.""


deadly Milk Duds?!? What is this world comming to? *shame*"

<lj-cut text=""freaky""> 
<img src=""http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/hooded_monk_lg.jpg"" alt="""" /> This photograph, possibly showing the ghost of a cowled monk standing by an altar rail was taken in the early 1960s by the vicar of a church in England. At the time he saw nothing that was out of the ordinary. But his developed film showed the tall phantom monk seen here. It appears to be about three meters (9 feet) tall. The film was carefully checked by photographic experts but showed no signs of tampering.


<img src=""http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/fence_ghost_lg.jpg"" alt="""" /> this is actually a picture of a pig...obviously this guy likes his pig. but anyways...if you look closely, you can see a woman staring at him with her arms crossed near the fence on the right. there is an enlarged picture on the left, but you aren't blind...right?

<img src=""http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/fairy_grave_lg.jpg"" alt="""" /> this is a picture that someone took in a graveyard. it was taken in the summer. there was nothing out of the ordinary in the picture when she took it, or so she says. she claims that it is a fairy...but we are smart enough to know that it is a bug that unknowingly flew into the path of a blinding camera flash...~*but it IS a fairy!*~...okee dokee

<img src=""http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/tv_ghost_lg.jpg"" alt="""" /> this is a picture of a new tv that this guy took at his house. his wife was at work, and his two kids were at school. but when he developed the film, he was suprised to see that there was a little boy sitting behind him in the reflection of the tv screen. oh by the way, the tv is not on. spookey...

kelley gave me purse's present today. we'll just call it a very late christmas present. he got me a Queen shirt, which obviously got me thinking of killer queen, my favorite Queen song. and he also got me a bouncy ball, which is exactly what i always wanted... 
and he burned me a CD, i'm not really sure if burned is the correct word to use there, but who's keeping tabs on my grammar? 

i think i'm gonna go dancing this weekend. i can't dance worth a lick, but i can move around a little. and with all those looser hip hop weirdos, i think moving around a lot counts as dancing. i'm not a hip hop fan, if you didn't catch my drift. 

but i don't have much time left in this retarded class...no insult intended by using the word retarded of course. typing is so pointless. i already know how to do that. that's life i guess, filled with seemingly pointes contributions from people you'd rather miss. oh well.

i have to play a song in church on guitar for mindi sunday. i'm kinda nervous, but it's good that i have performed for people before. seth is gonna try to come too! i think that's great. i really like that he enjoys hearing me play my guitar. he really supports me now, it used to aggrivate him because that's all i do. but i think he got over that. i'm happy. 
dad comes home today! i'm excited to play the song for him. oh, by the way if there are any jennifer knapp fans out there...we are doing a little more this sunday. it's a good song. anyways...back to what i was saying. i really miss dad when he goes to akron. it's pretty far from here, but i guess it could be worse. i'm just glad he gets to come home for new years. 
we are gonna have a little party like we always do. we are gonna have seafood and watch movies. then, when the ball dropps, we all go outside and bang on pots and yell happy new year. it's kinda funny seein a bunch of highschoolers banging pots. but we've been doing that since i was really young. 
seth and josh are gonna be there. i was gonna invite amber and some other friends, but she's in new york for the holidays. all my other friends have plans as far as i know. oh well. 
i found another band that i like. they are called Long Since Forgotten. i don't really know much about them, so i don't know how old they are or anything. but they are really good, even though they aren't as hard as i would like. they are more of a contemporary rock than hard rock. but oh well. they are nice.

(if you got all that...if not, just try to keep up:) ) anyways...i went to church and i realized that i should be celebrating God all the time. not just at church or when i feel like it. even when i am feeling low, He deserves every bit of the celebrating. i know i haven't been excactly celebrating him in the past, but i really hope to change that.

"event","hey journal. i haven't written in a while, but there hasn't exactly been anything going on in my life. i have been grounded...still, so that pretty much explains it. as for the little details, i suppose i'll just spit out some random information. 
i finished my first knitting project.
oh yeah, i learned how to knitt.
i have to take the ACT test tomorrow...AgH!
i made an A on my trig test.
i found some really cool backgrounds for my live journal, 
but i don't like the one i have on it right now.
it was seventy degrees Tuesday.
it was fourty degrees Wednesday.
i have finished all of my christmas shopping. woo hoo!
i just got some extra credit by knowing how to 
draw a circle in computer class. how ironic...
i'm learning how to play dream on by aerosmith.
my best friend has a new boyfriend! horray!
i can't stand jazz band. really...

ok, this is harder than it looks. i don't have much time left in class, but i think that's about it. if not, then i guess i'll have something to write about next time i get online. :)
until then...peace out. love you all!"

"event","welp, i just got finished with my computer tech assignment, so i decided to type about my life. not much has been happening lately. i got grounded from life because i was stupid and said things that i shouldn't have. my grades are comming up in literature class. um...i don't think i have anymore pointless information to tell anyone. other than the fact that this class is so everlastingly boring. i'm gonna cry by the time the year lets out. 
dad got to stay home all last week. i really love to spend time with him. i miss him a lot when he goes to work over the week. i don't like not being able to talk with him about guitar or computers whenever i want to. for some reason, i just cryed last night. i'm not really sure if it's from all the pressure i've been under lately, or wether it was because i miss him so much. i think it was a little of both. ugh...
welp, i don't have much time left, so i think i'll leave you on this note:
be careful with what you fill your day, make it right. 

luv you all!"

"event","welp, it's over between seth and me. i mean, now it's official i guess. not that i wanted it to be at all. i mean, i apologized to him and all, but he doesn't get it. on brad's quiz, i wrote , jokingly of course, that i would..well u know from the quiz...with him. but i would never do that to seth. ugh and i wouldn't do that with purse, he's my friend. seth doesn't get that. i understand that i haven't treated him well lately, but he just doesn't understand that a guy and a girl can be friends, and that's it. 

it's been this way since he graduated. i've made friends. i had to completely rebuild my social life because i ditched them all for him. i loved him so much. i never talked with them or went out with them. and now that i do, he wants me to choose between them and him. it's a decision that i can't make. i can understand him not liking some people, but he dislikes them all. and just like anyone in this world, people change when they go to church. and i hope he knows that. not all those people he dislikes are ""bad"" like he thinks they are. 

i know i've made him out to be a jerk more than he is, but he's not normally like this. he's always been there for me when i need help, and i was there for him. ugh y did it have to be like this? y can't we even talk to each other? i hate relationships that end in hatred. just so everyone knows, i have never hated him and i never will. i really care about him, but maybe this relationship just isn't made to last. even though i wish it were. 

to all my friends who care, luv u all."

"event","welp, after hours of work...i think i have finally got my lj looking how i would like it. actually, all the credit goes to brad. he did it all. thanks pal! 

in other news...i wish someone could explain to me what is going on between seth and me. he hated me the night before last for bein friends with brad, and then he adored me last night. ugh, so confusing. i think he's gonna stop by today, so i guess we'll set things straight then. maybe he'll make up his mind. 

to the anonymous commenter: i know u think i'm a terrible person, whoever u are. u are obviously one of seth's friends. u think i'm playing him. but the thing is, i told him that brad and i were friends long before all this happened. he's the one that can't get over the fact that one of my best friends is a guy. but from that note, i'll move on.

it's a beautiful day outside! the sun is out and it's really not that cold. (well, too cold for me, but i guess for the normal person...) we put our christmas lights out yesterday. they are nice, i must say. mindi is the one who told me what to do, so the credit goes to her. hmm...everyone gets credit but me around here, brad, mindi...oh well. 

i may be ungrounded from the phone today. that always makes me happy. but, my best friend hasn't even called me since friday. so i'm kinda wonderin if she hates me. well, i guess i've been in the i don't like u boat lately. hopefully i'll hit land soon. haha, paint a picture with my words. 

welp, that's all for now. later!"

"event","oh, i feel so terrible this morning. seth and i got into a huge argument last night. it was really bad. he saw what i wrote about purse yesterday in my lj, and he completely flipped. i don't even know why. he's so stupid. he was the one i was talking about. (bad grammar) ugh, if he could only get it through his thick skull that i care a lot about him, he would realize a lot. i mean, purse is my really good friend and i can talk to him about anything. seth had no say-so in with who i hang out. it makes me so angry that he tries to run my life! and now his family hates me for what he had made me out to be to them. (if you get that) they think i'm a terrible person! why? his mom doesn't trust me and his sister(the one i can't stand)thinks that i am an idiot. ugh! they are all insane! don't they know that a guy and a girl in fact CAN be best friends? i want to slam them all on the ground and tell them that to their faces. i don't care what they think anymore...this is my life and i'm not gonna let them(or seth for that matter)make me ashamed of who i hang with. or who my best friends are. ugh, i don't even care anymore!"

"event","welp, another day...ugh. i got grounded again! (no suprise i guess) i forgot to give my mom a message from my nana last night. when i told her this morning that she had called and i had forgotten to tell her, she got mad at me and grounded me from the phone. woopdeydoo. i hate it when she does this. it's so stupid. not that anyone ever calls anymore. wow, i'm just having a pity party today aren't i? oh well, everyone can have one sometime i guess.

have you ever put everything you have into a relationship that is just doomed to fail? i mean, you care about someone so much that you would give your life for them, and then they just throw everything in your face and turn out to be exactly what you hate. what you tried to prevent for an ""x"" amount of time. like they just left you for bigger and better things. or perhaps they go back to what they had before...something they always said they never wantd again. they ditch you, leave you on the side of the road with a paper McDonalds cup and a few cold french fries...but no ketchup. how awful it is to feel this way! to those close enough to me, you know of whom i am speaking. this sucks.

on the optamistic note: (i don't know how to spell optamistic, so if it's wrong, oh well) i got to talk to purse today. he said that he's gonna stop by this evening. yay! i really like him. i wish that he'd do something with me like go to the movies or chill at java joint. just something, you know? 

welp, i think it's time to wrap up this emo train. ugh, i hate emo! to those who care...i love you all! later."

"event","today wasn't as boring as i had expected it to be. mindi and i went out shopping. i got all the stuff i need for steph's, kelley's, amber's, and katy's presents. i'm really glad. it always relives me to get it done. we went to wal mart and the mall. ugh, the mall was a mad house. it really suprised me too because it isn't even thanksgiving yet. but there were a lot of sales going on. oh yeah!

we also bought some stuff to make for people. so i have been ""crafting"" since i got home. it gives me something to do i guess. even though i'm not much of a craft person. 

seth's sister is in from texas this weekend. aahh! i can't stand her. if you only knew how much i disliked that girl. i don't usually not get along with people, but she is such a...well, i just really can't stand her. she is always sayin junk about me. ugh, that really ticks me off, especially since she knows nothing about me. 

welp, purse just called...so i'm gonna jet. luv ya all! later."

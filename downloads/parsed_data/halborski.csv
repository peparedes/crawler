It is my home now.&nbsp; I like the Bay, but I really hate SoCal.&nbsp; Everybody drives with their head squarely up their ass and people all look so stupid.&nbsp; Also, it's very very hot down south and I don't really work well in hot temperatures.&nbsp; California is very different from Ohio, but I really like it here.

Dogs
I have a couple.&nbsp; My dog is so cute she's become the avatar for my LJ moods.&nbsp; She's a giant ham, but I love her anyway.


Gadgets
I can't live without them.&nbsp; I just got a new Blackberry and built a new computer.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have a DVD player in my car and a small collection of cameras.&nbsp; On my computer desk right now there are no less than seven different gadgets.

Alcohol
Alcohol isn't a terribly important word to me.&nbsp; I'll have a drink here and there and try to keep the beer drawer in the fridge full, but that's about the extent of it.&nbsp; I've only been really drunk once in my life and only been more than a little tipsy a few more times than that.&nbsp; I do like my boozes, but they're just not that important.

Sports
I miss living in Ohio where people cared about proper teams.&nbsp; Honestly, who cares about the A's or the Raiders?&nbsp; Go Browns.&nbsp; It's also really hard to follow sports when the person you live with doesn't like to watch with you.&nbsp; I haven't really watched anything on TV since I moved out here even though the Cavs were all over national TV.&nbsp; *shrug*"

"event","I'm taking a page from <lj user=""risby"">&nbsp;, who apparently stole it from Doris.&nbsp; Anyway...<br /><br /><strong>The Good:</strong>&nbsp; I arrived in California on January 1, 2008.&nbsp; Up until then I'd always lived with at least one of my parents.&nbsp; It was the first time I've lived on my own, first time I've lived with a girlfriend, and first time I've lived outside Ohio.&nbsp; That said, it's been great.&nbsp; Things are going better with <lj user=""jyxtrant"">&nbsp; than ever.&nbsp; I love my neighborhood.&nbsp; My dog has changed for the better.&nbsp; I'm cooking more, and I've learned to make so many fun new foods.&nbsp; I've had free time and I've been able to start reading books and playing games again.&nbsp; I think I&nbsp;read something like 15-18 books in 2008.&nbsp; It's been an entirely different experience than the first 26.5 years of my life, but it's been wonderful. &nbsp;It's nice to know a long distance relationship actually works the way you hope for once in a while.<br /><br /><strong>The Bad:</strong>&nbsp; Even with all the good, there are a few bad things worth mentioning.&nbsp; When I moved I&nbsp;didn't have a job lined up for when I arrived. &nbsp;This wasn't a huge problem, as I&nbsp;had some money saved up and was up-to-date on all my bills.&nbsp; I'm working retail now, after working almost 7 years in government.&nbsp; I like the work better, but the hours have been unsteady. &nbsp;What started as 30-40 hours per week in the spring and summer has gone to 20 in the fall and sometimes less than 10 in the winter.&nbsp; This is the first time in my adult life that money has been tight for me and it's been stressful.&nbsp; I also don't have any family and didn't have any friends in the Bay area before I moved out here.&nbsp; The distance and the time zones make it harder to keep in touch with people back home.&nbsp; I was able to come back to Ohio for a week for Thanksgiving, which was really nice.&nbsp; Hopefully in 2009 I&nbsp;can do a little more, but only time will tell.<br /><br /><strong>The Ugly:</strong>&nbsp; Girlfriend's ex is still clingy and weird.&nbsp; My ex has mostly left me alone, but I still get the odd message every so often.&nbsp; I had a fluke problem with my car on the way down to Con V that ended up costing about $3,000.&nbsp; Thanks to my very awesome girlfriend and even more awesome mom we arrived in Arizona only a few hours later than expected and eventually got home without further incident.&nbsp; I meant to write a post about Con and the whole fiasco, but just never got around to it.&nbsp; It can be so hard for me to sit down and write things out sometimes.&nbsp; Even when&nbsp;I want to, I still have to force myself.<br /><br /><strong>For 2009:&nbsp;</strong> I don't believe in making resolutions, so none of that stuff.&nbsp; I'd really like to make some sort of plan or outline for myself, but it's just impossible right now.&nbsp; Girlfriend is applying to graduate school, and depending on where and when she decides to go we could be making another big move in 2009.&nbsp; Work is going well, but unless I&nbsp;can get a decent promotion (which the bosses have hinted at is pretty likely) I'll need to move on.&nbsp; It's fun, but it's not paying the bills.&nbsp; I'd like to another big KOL meet this year.&nbsp; Orecon is about 50/50 yes/no right now, and with the moving situation still up in the air it's impossible to speculate about&nbsp;Con.&nbsp; I'm building a new computer.&nbsp; So far I have everything I need to build it except the motherboard and RAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm so close, but so far...&nbsp; The girlfriend and I have been talking about the future of our relationship and it's looking like special rings and dresses might not be too far off.<br /><br />I hope everybody reading this had a good 2008.&nbsp; If you didn't, I'm sure your 2009 will be much better.&nbsp; I love every one of you, even if I&nbsp;fail to keep in touch as much as I&nbsp;should.<br />"

"event","So after years of mixing different parts lemonade, lemon juice, vodka, ice, and sugar syrup in every possible combination I finally figured out the recipe of the frozen lemon martinis I used to get at Hilarities.

6 oz Lemonade
a generous shot of lemon RUM
add ice and blend

It was called a lemon martini, so I always assumed it was made with vodka or gin.&nbsp; It obviously wasn't gin, so I always tried with vodka and it never tasted quite right.&nbsp; The rum was the key.&nbsp; It's so simple, and I'm kind of embarrassed I didn't figure it out before now.

The last day of the drive was out here terrible.  It was just up and down in mountains and through boring deserts in Utah and Nevada.  It was below freezing for most of the day and below 0 for most of the night.  It was -10 when I stopped to get a snack in Salt Lake City shortly after midnight.  It got warmer once I got down off the mountains.  On this side of Tahoe it was over 60.  I drove the last few hours with my sunroof open.<br />  Piper enjoyed her ride.

The dog has been surprisingly behaved this whole drive, until last night.  She wouldn't let me sleep.  I stopped at a hotel because I knew I could use an actual bed (and probably a shower) instead of just sleeping in my car seat a few hours here and there at rest stops.  Of course, Piper was sleeping the entire car trip, so when we got somewhere and got out of the car all she wants to do is explore.  I wasn't able to sleep for more than a few hours at a time without having her step on me, whine at somebody walking past the room, or just get up and pace around the room.  I swear, if it wasn't 15 degrees outside I'd lock her in the car.  On top of that, I forgot today was Monday and not Sunday and missed breakfast.  grr.
Anyway, things are good.  I should be able to make one more push and end up in Cali at Jyxie's house late late tonight or early tomorrow morning.  I'm gonna miss New Years Eve, but I felt sleep and resting my sore legs was more important."

I got to Chicago around 2:00am, and felt the exact opposite of tired.  I stopped around Gary just to rest my eyes for a little bit because the bright lights on the highway were stressing them out.  After resting for about 90 minutes and not really being able to sleep I decided ""what the hell, I'm gonna keep driving.""  I post this just outside Des Moines.  I've been driving for a little over 12 hours straight, and the sun is just about to come up.  I still don't feel tired, so I think I'm gonna keep going until a little after noon so I can get a hotel room without worrying about having to check out after only a few hours sleep (like if I got it at 2:00am like I planned).  Yay road trip!

I also also had a giant bag of candy that my coworker gave to me for my long road trip out in my car.  I got a craving during the football game Sunday and brought a bag full of mini boxes of Grape Nerds into my room.  I left my house on Christmas Eve to have dinner with my family and didn't even think to clean up the candy and garbage can.  She usually only fishes stuff out of the garbage that smells like meat, like if I microwave something on a paper towel or napkin or something.  Anyway, I wasn't worried too much about fruity candy.  I was wrong.

I came home to find wrappers all over the floor.  I counted 4 entire rolls of Lifesavers, 3 rolls of Smarties, and portions of 4 different boxes of grape Nerds.  I found a dog with eyes as wide as dinner plates.  This look didn't go away for another day and a half.  I had a very restless puppy that night."

"event","Christmas is almost here, and I'm finally starting to feel Christmas-y.&nbsp; I've been so busy with all the moving and christmas stuff that I just haven't had time to relax and enjoy it.&nbsp; So here's what's going on:

-2 more days work.&nbsp; I put my notice in a couple weeks ago, but wanted to work as much as I could before I took off.&nbsp; Also, working Wednesday and Thursday guarantees me holiday pay for Christmas and Christmas Eve.&nbsp; They should be pretty easy days.&nbsp; I can't really start any new projects and I've been filtering all my busy work down to my replacements.&nbsp; I think it'll just be two days of joking and flirting with the young female holiday help.&nbsp; woot.

-packing is nearly done.&nbsp; I put the empty boxes in my car to see what I can realistically fit today.&nbsp; I figured 4 boxes in the trunk, 3 in the back seat and 1 more in the front passenger seat.&nbsp; That left enough room on the floor between the front and back seats for my computer and laptop bag.&nbsp; I figured I'd need every cubic inch of space to get all my stuff and then still need to ship some more, but after packing I don't think that's the case.&nbsp; I already boxed up most of my clothes and all my books and I only used 3 boxes.&nbsp; If I can fit the rest of my stuff in 3 boxes I'll be able to fit Piper in the car.&nbsp; I wasn't planning on taking her with me in the car, but if I have the room it would be silly not to.&nbsp; A plane ticket for her is going to cost over $200, not including the cost of an enormous sized travel crate.&nbsp; My mom said she would get me a crate for Christmas, but she went shopping too late and it would have to be a special order (since stores don't carry size Enormous).&nbsp; On top of all that, I'd probably have to wait several months for her to come simply because of winter weather and flying.&nbsp; Even though it's going to make my drive more inconvenient, it'll be worth it in the long run to just ship a box or two and take her with me.&nbsp; I probably won't know what I'm doing until the very last minute.&nbsp; Jyxie, don't be surprised if I arrive with a very excited puppy!

-family stuff is good(ish).&nbsp; I'm at my Aunt/Grandma's house right now.&nbsp; Everybody on my mom's side is really happy for me and is being really supportive.&nbsp; I'm getting really excited!&nbsp; My dad has been...typical.&nbsp; When I told him I was moving he acted like he wasn't surprised at all.&nbsp; He seemed completely unfazed, even though I know it's got to be bothering him.&nbsp; I tried breaking it to him soft, and I tried hinting about it, but he wouldn't bite.&nbsp; Even though I had a stack of boxes sitting in the garage for weeks, he never asked.&nbsp; I asked him questions about the house that hinted toward me not being there, and he wouldn't bite.&nbsp; I tried leading him into the conversation, and he'd go in a different direction.&nbsp; It's obvious he knew what I wanted to talk about, but when he doesn't want to hear something he'll pretend it's not there.&nbsp; He wouldn't talk about it, no matter what I did, until I finally came out and bluntly said ""I'm moving"".&nbsp; So I did that.&nbsp; Arg.&nbsp; I really didn't want it to come to this, but I had to.&nbsp; My mom says it was the same whenever she wanted to talk to him about anything important.

I'm finally ready to go.&nbsp; Let the happiness and impatience start!"

"event","&nbsp; I guess things are going pretty well right now.&nbsp; My dad seems to sort of have things together for the time being, but I have to think it's only temporary.&nbsp; He hasn't worked steadily in over a year now, and he's still just taking things here and there and doesn't have anything long term.&nbsp; I helped my mom get into her new house.&nbsp; It's big, much bigger than one person needs.&nbsp; It's a really nice house though.&nbsp; There's still a ton of unpacking left to do, but it's mostly clothes and decorations and books and things that she can unpack herself once she figures out where it's all going.&nbsp; I managed to get her TV/DVD/Stereo/DVR all hooked up, and put her computer back together and hooked up the new cable modem.
&nbsp; Work is so-so.&nbsp; It's still busy as hell with all the old folks, but at least it's not a really stressful kind of busy as hell.&nbsp; Most days I can't get my regular work done because of it, and I've been slowly falling behind more every day for the past 7-10 days.&nbsp; I think it's about to level out though, and this morning I managed to get a little bit of my backlog done before getting buried yet again.&nbsp; I somehow managed to get my vacation approved for next month.&nbsp; It's too far off, for several reasons.
&nbsp; Relationship stuff is...&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I guess it's all good on the surface, but I'm just not feeling it right now.&nbsp; After all the bullshit of the last month I've pretty much hardened my heart to the whole thing.&nbsp; I'm not saying it's over or it won't get better, but as it is right now I have to make a conscious effort to keep trying.&nbsp; After several months of listening to how much she cares about her ex, and several months of them still kissing and cuddling after they broke up I really found it hard to keep thinking about her as a potential relationship.&nbsp; The kissing and cuddling has stopped now, after the 4th or 5th step of the breakup, but my feelings still haven't really come back yet.&nbsp; It's been hard making the distance work right now too.&nbsp; We haven't seen each other since the beginning of June, and won't see each other again until the middle of August.&nbsp; That isn't a huge problem by itself, but there's other things.&nbsp; Like, it's tough to have a personal conversations.&nbsp; There have been too many times when we'll be in the middle of something personal, and all of a sudden she has to go somewhere else, or all of a sudden she feels sleepy and has to go lay down or something like that.&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; It's getting better, but it's going to take a while."

&nbsp; So anyway, Sunday he and his wife go shopping.&nbsp; They're at the store, and she pretty much takes over.&nbsp; She starts talking to the sales associate and starts asking about different cameras.&nbsp; All the while Gene is just wandering around playing with all the other cameras in the display.&nbsp; Nearby there's another sales associate, a young girl, sweeping up the floors and cleaning up under the registers.&nbsp; Gene is taking pictures of things that catch his eye around the store with various cameras, which at this point would be the backside of the bent-over salesgirl.&nbsp; Imagine how proud she'll be when she discovers her ass all over the camera display!&nbsp; I can only hope somebody went a step further and then hit the print button on some of those photo printers that were hooked up to the cameras.&nbsp; *grin*"

"event","&nbsp; So I'm pretty convinced my boss doesn't understand the concept of laws.&nbsp; We work in a government office - one that deals heavily with accounting and is very closely governed by laws set forth by the State of Ohio.&nbsp; I don't mind so much when he makes up his own rules and does his own little thing with his business, but most of what we do involves a half-assed system of dual-control and double checks (which is also mostly ignored).&nbsp; This means every so often he'll do something that goes completely against the rules or he'll make decisions that are completely beyond the scope of our office and then ask me to sign my name to them.&nbsp; I do this, because he's my boss and I don't really have a choice.&nbsp; I try my best to cover my own ass, asking for written documentation for anything I might think is shady, and then asking for documentation to back up written statements when applicable.&nbsp; Of course, since nobody else does this I tend to come off as a bit of a hardass from time to time, but I'm okay with that.&nbsp; I'd rather allow people to be annoyed with me for doing my job properly than be dragged into court to defend our office policies because I signed my name to something that shouldn't have ever been processed (like Bob has so many times).
&nbsp; Relationship things are so-so.&nbsp; There's a lot right now that needs sorted out, but it's not possible to do that right now.&nbsp; Only time can make things clearer, and it's going to take patience and understanding from both sides.&nbsp; The biggest problem right now is we're both pitifully lonely, but it's not a good time for us to rely on each other to fix this.&nbsp; It's hard to support someone while at the same time not getting close emotionally.&nbsp; It's even harder when I need support myself and she's just not capable of giving it.
&nbsp; Ok, I go find lunch now.&nbsp; I wasn't hungry when I sat down but I am now and I don't think I can make it through another 4 hours of work without something in my belly."

"event","&nbsp; You'd think this would actually be interesting, being my first post and all.&nbsp; Truth is, I can't seem to get my body moving today.&nbsp; It's a holiday and I'm off from work.&nbsp; I was up until about 5:00am, and then got woke up around 8:00 to help my dad move a log splitter out of the garage.&nbsp; I got to go back to sleep, and I even slept for a couple hours before I went to bed last night, so it's not like I haven't been sleeping enough.&nbsp; I think my body's just crashing from the last few weeks of not sleeping/stress/etc.<br />&nbsp; Things are going mostly better with the stress things.&nbsp; Work is still busy as hell, but it's not been too bad.&nbsp; The worst part is with Bob gone everybody in the office has lost the ability to think for themselves.&nbsp; I keep getting interrupted by people asking me what they should do, and before I can answer somebody else comes in and another coworker is asking me.&nbsp; Out of the 4 people I work with, one hasn't been in for nearly 3 weeks now, another doesn't know how to actually <i>DO </i>anything around the office, another one has been completely wrapped up in her new grandbaby, and another completely wrapped up in trying to sell her house.&nbsp; Arg.&nbsp; I'm not going to lie and say I don't do the same kind of things and blow off work some days, but it's been my turn to do everything for nearly 3 weeks now and I'm starting to get worn out.<br />&nbsp; Relationship things right now are...weird.&nbsp; I guess things are closer than they've ever been to actually working, but I keep finding myself having to try really hard.&nbsp; I don't really feel like talking a lot, and I don't really feel like opening up when I do talk.&nbsp; I know what it is, and it's probably the best thing for me right now.&nbsp; I just hope I can turn it around when I'm ready."

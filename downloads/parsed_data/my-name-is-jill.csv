<P><FONT color=#330099>On another note I am extremely excited about this weekend...I get to go skiing (ever since I got to college I just don't get to ski as much as I used to)...And I get to see two thirds of my immediate family.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330099>On some other note...I am not looking foward to my three hour class that is taking place at 6:45 tonight...but on the bright side at least it's only once a week.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330099>it turns out that i really don't have much to say...so i will stop this journal entry for now and do something else...anyway have a nice day.&nbsp; goodbye!</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#33cc00 size=1>Dear one and all:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00 size=1>Happy Holidays to you and now back to ME!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00 size=1>I was told before I left school that I have to just sit down and write this entry already...there are reasons why an entry has not been posted in, well, forever.&nbsp; I started writing this entry a few other times...most of the time I didn't like how it was turning out (so I trashed it, over and over again).&nbsp; A few times I ran out of time when trying to write my entry and well that is why it has not been posted until this current time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=1>The studio final was a week and a half of quite literal HELL...yes it was go to studio, eat, go to classes, some more studio, sleep for 3-4.5 hours a night, shower, Saturday morning at 12:30 cut your finger (that is my finger), go to hospital until five to get stitches in...etc. etc.&nbsp; This hell had no interuptions...nothing fun happened during that time and HELL was there...ALL THE TIME.&nbsp; I hate that type of repetitiveness...it has got to drive a person insane (good thing I was not sane when I started the project).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666 size=1>Christmas is tomorrow...and what does that mean?&nbsp; Yes it means gifts for ME...the good little <FONT size=6><STRONG><EM><U>JEW</U></EM></STRONG></FONT> (what the F***!!!???).&nbsp; I can't wait!!!&nbsp; Although I basically picked out everything I am getting...I won't be suprised...but that doesn't mean&nbsp;I won't be happy about getting the gifts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=1>The last matter of business is the dedication of this journal entry...and since Re has stated that I have not dedicated any to her...I did tell her that none of the randomness that I have ever written was about her that it wouldn't be logical...but now here comes a time when I can dedicate this entry to her...the reasons being that she is the one who told me to buckle myself down and just write the entry...secondly she was one fifth of the people during the studio final hell that kept me entertained (for example when she said ""Oh my balls"" instead of ""Oh balls"")...thirdly I was at a loss of who else to dedicate my entry to...So for the record Re have a merry Christmas and I hope your exams went real well...and that your family is well...oh and that you get all of the great gifts that you wanted!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc0000 size=2>On that note I would actually like everybodies families to be awesome...for everybody to have done well on exams, for everybody to get what they want for Christmas&nbsp; and lastly I would love for everybody to have an awesome holiday...-Jill</FONT></P>"

"event","<FONT color=#33ccff size=2>This is the very first entry of my live journal. So I will tell you a little about...something! I hate smiley faces...so you won't be seeing them on my page. I call inatement objects by the name of <EM>COLIN</EM>. I am a neurotic person who wakes up at 9:00 AM every Saturday morning to do laundry before other people get up and decide to clean their dirty clothes. I do not like a particular architecture professor that goes by the name FORGET (and that is not pronounced like forget). I like to read books...but mostly that urge comes when I have like all nighters in studio coming my way. I want to learn how to fence...I want to go rifle shooting and archery shooting again. I'm really not that bad with aim...I know most people would want to be about a million miles away from me if I actually had anything other than a toy gun in my hand. I have named myself the official architect for the short people (people under five feet). I am a sarcastic person who will try to cheer people up by making them laugh (is there any other way?). I...I...I don't know what else is interesting to talk about right now...oh by the way September 22nd is officially named <U>ALTERNATOR DAY</U>.</FONT>"

okay now for the real update i had to put something seeing i was at six weeks so i thought i would embrace the mexican in me while i made new icons.

i am on about three hours of sleep and i was listening to my discman and i realized a second ago i never turned it on, the sad thing about this is i have had the earphones on for about two hours, i am thinking i need sleep.

i really have the urge for some nachos suddenly i wish i had some lyrics to put into this update but all that comes to mind is SOMEEETIMEEESS LOVE DOESNTTT FEEELLL LIKE IT SHOULLLD OHHH BABBBY HURTTTS SO GOOD

that was dedication to cyrus, i would say to steve but he is kind of scaring me lately i mean i know you like the cock but you do not need to show the world that in your wardrobe choice, oh yeah i am burning that hat too while i am at it.

chad has been away for hours i think he drowned in his tub, besides that i am going now bye."

i was just going to update with the cd is coming out soon blah blah blah and so on, but i think the rest of my band that actually is active has said it in better words than me

i meant to comment to cyrus' post, but too tell you the truth i was jealous that i never get any beach time with him so i couldn't live past my spite and muster a comment to give to him

kidding so maybe i just didn't want to put down my new hair pomade i was trying out and get my keyboard all sticky at the time, but i like my first excuse first

besides that i am watching devil's pond, it has tara reid in it and it is about a psycho husband who kills his father and then forces his wife to come live in the woods next to his dead father, what type of movie am i watching seriously and if that is not bad enough the guy falls asleep after sex everytime if i was her id be like psh i can find a better man, girl power you know what i am saying i would not let any man use me for sex and then force me to live with their dead father nu uh boy it ain't happening

"event","i am going to update with a story for you all so i hope you appreciate it

once upon a time a long time ago, okay maybe not that long ago, a young lad name jordan skipped off to find himself a computer, once he found this he logged onto www.livejournal.com and found himself a journal, weeks passed and even though his bandmates entertained him, he had a change in heart and mind and soon it was almost like he came to be a new person.

looking back in his entries before that time he decided to vanish them from his journal, knowing they would only bring back bad memories of who he used to be. with one press of a button, or actually a couple hundred, the magical delete key did it's job. 

he then ran off to tell his friends of his victory, writing two entries in place within the time span that followed. he tried to make his journal official, but with a couple smartass remarks he was denied and banished back to the website to write a third entry.

and really that is why you are getting this lame update, excuse me while i go off and skip hand and hand with chad to the nearest sushi restraunt and live happily ever after, bye."

"event","chad spammed me earliar and within the spammage told me to update and well i listen to chad so look at this i am here updating but i really have nothing to say i should of just offered to take him out for sushi instead and then distracted him while out so he forgot all about that update but of course i did not think of that and now it is almost one am and i am stuck doing an update because it is hard to say no to chad :-[

well after reading my friends page again i am never sitting on steve and cyrus' couch again, actually correction i am never walking into their house i refuse i do not know what they could have on the carpets and any of the other furniture and just thinking about making food in their kitchen and what could be on their counters has made me lose my appetite for the rest of the night, i really do not appreciate that at all for now on i am filtering cyrus out of my friends page and maybe steve too, actually forget that i am just going to make a chad filter because you know his face is the only one i really want to see on my friends page sorry everyone else

well that is the end of this update ps i saw a picture of me with billy martin today and i was going to make an icon out of it but i remember i hate billy so i just made another of chad and i in place, end story. bye."

"event","i should pay someone to update for me but i am already enough in debt from credit card bills so i think i am going to pass on that but i was thinking next time i might throw a bag of croutons into a room with my laptop and send chad after them, locking the door and hoping something would come out of that, but i'll probably just end up with stick keys and no update. and no you perverts i mean from the dressing not anything else.

besides that there is not much for me to update about all the rest of my band has already informed you all that we're in the studio so being repetitive would just be a pain, but i did just say it again but deal with it because i am not backspacing. also after seeing ian's update in welcome wagon yesterday i think i am partially blind now and it's really hard for me to hit the right keys so if there is in typos in this blame ian thanks

i don't really feel like writing anymore but i got over the paragraph mark so be impressed. i should go find chad now i just saw billy idol on tv and got excited about our reinactment."

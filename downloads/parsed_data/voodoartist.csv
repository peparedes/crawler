"event","Jolie and I returned to the US on Fat Tuesday, of all days. We got there just in time to rescue Nanette from a vampire gang war. There were werewolves and demons and sliced up tourists everywhere. It was lovely. Like a horror movie buffet. Please to note my sarcasm here.
As for Paris? Where to start.... I don't get it all. From what I understand of Jolie's story, a long time ago some French folk, before they were French, guarded the name of a Hellgod. I assume that's either a Hell that is also a god or a god of a Hell. Anyway, this name in the wrong hands would end the world or something. So, when the Romans invaded France, before it was France, they hid the name in someone's head. The side effect turned out to be telepathy. You can see where I'm going. Anyway, long story short, the guy gave it to his son to his son to his... etc. right on down to Jolie's dad. Now, Jolie's dad passed it onto her. So, Jolie has the name of a Hellgod stuck in her head and people will be trying to get it from her. My girlfriend just became a target. Yahoo. Please to note my sarcasm here."

"event","You know, I always figured I'd go to Paris. Not like this, though. Its been one hell of a week so far. Remy got himself clawed up by his girlfriend. I don't mean he got his back scratched up playing doctor. I mean she grew demon claws and ripped open his skin. She used his cellphone to call me and Jolie and I went to get him and call the EMTs. Jesus Christ, he looked back. Sounds okay now. 
Then Jolie gets a call from her dad. Drop everything and come to Paris. Its an emergency. No, we won't tell you what the emergency is. She was near panic. So, I went with her. I couldn't let her face whatever this is by herself.
Cross-Atlantic plane trip? Not fun. We both dropped to bed exhausted after we got there. Then I have a dream. A vision. A visitation. Erzili, my loving and kind, wonderful and bitchy Loa visits me and tells me I can't play with Lola anymore because she's bossy and mean and has bad hair. Jesus Christ, repeated twice! How do I deal with my Loa telling me I can't spend time with my best friend? Except, Jolie sort of pointed out, Lola's not. Everytime we talk we end up in a fight or, worse, frosty chilly, because for some reason I can't even talk about her love life. Erzili is right. She can be shrewish, sometimes. I had to look up what shrewish meant in the dictionary. So, at least I learned a new word. Erzili also slapped me. The mark's still there. This nice, red hand print.
I'm about to go meet Jolie's incredibly rich and cultured parents for the first time with a red hand slap mark on my face.
Tell me how this can get worse."

"event","Sure, I figured there might be other Night Hags out there. I didn't figure they'd come after me! I was in the bayou, working with Granmere Laveau when we smelled smoke. Someone had set the boat on fire. When the fire worked its way to the house we had no choice except to go outside. Then someone hit us both over the head. Granmere went out like a light. I got attacked. She was gorgeous looking, just like Dominique, and she was cruel. Just like Dominique. I managed to get her away from Granmere before she started clawing open my chest.
Then she coughed up a roach. Then more bugs. Then... I won't describe it. But when everything was done all that was left was a swarm of insects. Granmere had woken up and she was angry. She saved my life. My magic didn't work that well. The one grisgris I managed to cast went wrong and blinded me instead. Some great hougan, huh? I've just got to work harder, is all.
Meanwhile, in the drama front, Mac and I buried the hatchet. I think. We had a talk and we agreed to try to try to be better little boys. He seemed pissed when he found out Lola told me who he was, though. I guess she wasn't supposed to. I assumed it was okay - that since she knew he knew her team would know. Not that I'm really on Lola's team right now. Things are pretty strained between her and I. 
On the other hand, Remy's like a little brother. Who would have thought?"

"event","I finished figuring out the magic that's been nagging my dreams every night for the last few weeks. I call it Erzulie's Touch. It makes people feel like the first time they fell in love. You know, sweaty, butterflies in the stomach, dry mouth, totally aware of every physical flaw you have? Yeah, I can guess what you're thinking, but it really is handy. I bet if I cast it on someone/thing in the middle of a fight they'd lose focus and slip up. Its not an easy feeling to cope with. So, good gris gris. The only drawback is that in order to make it happen I have to coat my lips in this balm. A female Loa just had to go and pick me. Couldn't be a male Loa, could it?
I told Jolie the other night about the other thing that's been nagging me - the sense that I'm supposed to do something or make something happen. Gather something. I don't know and I'm trying not to worry about it. I figure it will come when it comes. I just know it'll require a lot of my attention, so I told Lola I was stepping down. I'd be there when she needed me but I couldn't be there all the time. Not right now. Lola understood, I think. Jolie was totally supportive. I love her.
We talked some about Jolie's future. I know sometimes she feels directionless - not good enough (she thinks) to make a go of her music and wealthy enough not to really need to strive for a living. I told her what I thought: Jolie was born to be a leader. She's just got that... aura around her. It makes you want to trust her and the confidence helps you believe what she's saying. I don't know what she can do with that but I'm looking forward to the end result.
One of my photographs sold. It was the one with Lola's eyes imposed on my mom's house (title: Soul of the Bayou). Five hundred dollars. Not bad. I'm starting to feel like a professional artist. 
Speaking of money, I must remember Valentine's Day. This will be Jolie's and my first one so it has to be special. Not my photography because that's something I do all the time. Not dinner, either. Not flowers or candy. I think I have an idea, though."

"event","Girls keep diaries. That's what I used to tell myself. Its also the first thing I thought of when the Old Woman told me I needed to write things down. 
'Write down yer dreams, boy.' she said to me, 'and yer thoughts. It help keep you you. It help keep you sane. Lot of folk, the go insane under the weight of the Loa. Why you think there so many follow the left handed path?'
I learned early on in my lessons. Always do what the Old Woman say. It'll hurt if you try not to and in the end you will anyway. So, journal. Here it is. 
Note to self. Hide this where Jolie won't find it. Probably my darkroom. We don't invade each other's artistic spaces.
So, let's see. The basics. My name is Luc Lafayette Lee. I'm 21. I'm originally from North Carolina but I spent most of my life in New Orleans. My dad's dead. My mom isn't and she's a beautiful woman - still hot enough that she makes the most money dancing at her club. That's not to say I lust after my mom. I don't. But a son can think his mom is beautiful. What else? Jolie.
Jolie is my girlfriend. My first real girlfriend. My second, I guess, if you count Lola. I should talk about Lola, too. Jolie first, though. Jolie is... sunshine. She's Snow White only with this secret little spot of Wicked Witch inside. I'm happier when I'm with her. No one makes me feel like she does. Considering my past, I'm damn lucky to have her. I really am. She's a telepath. I don't mean she's good at guessing what I'm thinking. She's a real telepath. She can read people's minds. Its why we don't live together. One of the reasons, anyway. We tried it but it made her irritable after a while. It was hard for her to stay out of my head spending so much time so close together. So, now we live apart and we're getting closer again. I'm glad we're working it out. I don't want to lose her. Lord knows I've almost fucked this whole relationship thing up more than once.

See, the thing is, I'm a recovering asshole. Hi. My name's Luc. And I'm an asshole. Its been three weeks since I said something assholish.

Hi Luc!

Seriously, though. This is where Lola comes into play. Lola is a girl I dated back in my high school days. I should say that I dated a lot of girls. I slept with a lot more. I'm pretty lucky I didn't catch something, to be honest. I'd screw anything female that attracted my attention. The list seems to go on forever when I think about it. Kimmie. Dominique. Lum (though she was mostly about the oral. Gypsy purity thing). Anne. I could go on. I won't, though. No point. Lola, anyway. Lola was the best of them. Sweetest. Smartest. Most fun to be with. I screwed her over hard, though. Literally, yeah, but I knocked her up. When she told me, I ran.
I'm not too proud of that. When I came back, at first, she told me she had lost the baby. Later, she told me the truth. She got rid of it on purpose. Sometimes, in my dreams, I see that baby looking at me with this dead eyes and asking me why it was never born. 
No wonder Jolie wanted to move out, if she got some of that kind of dream in her mind through her telepathy, huh?
Anyway, to make a long story short, I ran and found photography as an art. Got involved with a demoness, though I didn't know it. Found out. Ran back home scared. The Old Woman sent me to Lola. Lola, it turns out, is a Slayer. Big. Strong. Fast. Supernaturally powerful. I always knew she was special on some level but damn... anyway. Anyway, Lola saved me. She killed the demoness and she and I found some kind of peace. Worked on a friendship. There was some sexual tension but I think one last go got us both out of each other's system. Now we're friends. Its strained, at times. Mostly because of my jerk-i-tude. I fall off the wagon every once and a while. Keep trying, though.
I'm learning to do voodoo. Seriously. Turns out Erzulie, one of the Loa, handpicked me. She's the spirit of beauty, love, jewelry, dancing, luxury, flowers... in her most terrible aspect she's a wrathful snake ready to strike, in her most tragic she weeps for lost love and heartache, in her most beautiful, she is the belle of the ball, the exotic beauty married to three powerful male Loa. Oh, when she rides her chosen? She likes to dress up. First thing. I may be more sensitive now but the idea of cross-dressing, even when someone else is in control of my body, makes me shudder. 
Still, I can do real magic and I use it to help Lola, best I can. Me and Jolie both, we help Lola fight the bad. Demons and vampires and such. I'm looking for a guy named Patrick Lincoln right now. He holds the key to saving the entire city from a fate worse than Abba.

Wish me luck.

Wow it sure has been awhile since iv posted a entry in livejournal. Im thinking almost a year or more. Reading all the old entries
was really funny, brought back some good and sad memories.&nbsp;
Life has changed amencly since my last post. I still live in Chilliwack, unfortunitly. Iv done a small bit of traveling nothing to as of
what i hoped, but oh well. I am just finishing registering for school. I will be taking the nursing unit clerk @ ucfv. Im nervouse
about it and i hope im making the right choice. I am currently 22 years old.&nbsp;
I live with Cameron, (my boyfriend) Kitrenna one of my best friends, and my younger cousin Nikki.
Things are going well. Iv tried my best to say incontact with my close friends.&nbsp; Amanada, Iza, Steive, Heidi, jill and Kitrenna.
Most of which i am still pretty close with. Amanda just had her second child. Annalise. Shes adorable. She is engaged to
Pual a wonderful guy and im soo happy for her. She deserves all the best. I know iza and stevie are busy with school
and work so it sometimes can be hard to meet up. I think we are all at a age where we understand that we cant all
get together becuase we all have large responsiblites now. JIllian and i have definitly become closer. We went through a rough
patch (which seems to be documented here on LiveJournal) but i have grown up and took some responsiblites for what happened.
It was so long ago detials are scetchy anyways. We acutally have a trip planned for next month. We will all be heading to my cabin
in the states for a snag/girls night. It should be fun.
Im glad we have all grown so far into wonderful, ambiouse, lovely, careing people.
Each and every single friend i have extremly proud of, we have all started to figure out who we are, and what we want to be.
I know the journey is still a long road ahead but i think that we will all do just fine. Im very excited aobut the future. I spent a long time
dwelling and wishing i was younger and wishing things were easier...but now im glad to be growing up, moving on and doing really exciting things with my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I will hopefully update more. I know their is still tons of things that i would love to blog about~

Love Always

1) First For how the canucks are playing (no comment!)

2) Second because i cannot beleive our government
has let this annual seal hunt go on for this long.
I think its absoluty barbaric and mortifying.
i have writtin to chuck strahl our leader for conservative.
I think everyone who beleives this should write a letter too.
There answers for why they are allowing this is stupid
and they have just raised the amount of seals that can be
killed to around 300,000. Thats just outragouse!
We need to put a stop to this NOW!

"event","summer is ending, im so sad. It flew by so fast! It was werid.
2 years now since we graduated. Thats just werid. I feel old. lol
Well my cousin anthony is down. He just called me becuase he was
drifting into chilliwack. Since i live in an apartment alone i thought
i could use the company. I miss cam alot! But we talked like 12 times a
day so its all good. Its hard him being all the way in Alberta. Im sad
i have to give up our apartment and move out sometime in the next couple months. Having that apartment made me feel closer to cam. I still cant beleive we lived together for like 2 months. I felt so grown up. lol. haha i lived with a boy! (we pretty much lived trogether before anyways) But im soo
happy for cam finally doing somehting he and i am proud of. The oil rigs is a hard job, but im so glad hes finally doing something. We are saving and in Dec or Jan we are going to Mexico together. IM sooo excited for that.
Hes going to make sooooooo much money out there. I havnt figured out yet
if its worth him being so far away. Im glad i have such great friends
to keep me going. Fexy pretty much lives at my house with Dionne.
I love it beycase it makes my lonley apartment seem so livly and happy
with dionne and amnada there. Im so glad shes there. I tried once to sleep
alone in the apartment by myself but i ended up driving to my rents house
at 4:30am and crawling onto the couch and sleeping there. It felt soo comforting to sleep there again. To bad i dont have a bed room there.
But on the flip side im stoked to paint my bacement this weekend and move slowley in the next couple weeks. I am looking at a really cute car right now. Its so cheap and its 05' i love it. We are kinda of finalizing the deal this week if my dad gets approved the car will be mine hopefully by this weekend. Im so stoked. But im trying not to be to exicted because things might not go through. Sometimes i wanna just drop everything and move to Alberta with cam, the minum wage is like 11 bucks down there/ But living is alot more expensive. I feel really bad for cam becuase his dad was just addmited to the hospital again. This time for a blood clot in his lungs and Phemonia. Wow his dad is a strong person, i dont wanna talk about it much but i just wish him alll the best! Poor cam and his family!.....and its even harder with cam beibng so far away from his dad.......................
I heard Angolina and Brad pitt are in town filming a movie. Apparenty they are up chilliwack lake road. My rents drove up there but were stopped by Secruity. there is signs and everyhting. ITs sweet.
Last weekend was fun. Me and amanda meet up wiht alex and some peeps at the Mirage in Surrey and danced. It was good fun, got a little to drunk aint going to lie, might have puked. lol, i hate getting like that but sometimes it happens. Well we can just add that to my already great rep. (no comment)
anyways this all from me! maybe ill update in another 6 months. 
miss you cam!  GREEN DAY CONCERT IN 15 days yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
love Rachy"

ugggghhh .....
This summer has been so much fun so far! Last weekend i went camping with Fexy
and her family. And Andrew and Brian Drove up (they got lost and drove 2 hours past
the campsite!) hahahaha. We all got hammerd and watched the stars. Thanks to mr. Jack Danilles
i was quite hammerd. Then we ran out of alchole and decided to drive outta the campsite
and find the nearest bar/pub or alchole selling place. We were in the middle of the now
were but there was like 4 pubs and they were all closed.  We ended up getting
into a fight with a older chinnese lady who wouldnt let us into the bar!
hahahahahahahha oh god. Then we drove 45 mins to Hope, and found a country western
bar. The best thing happend. Me and fexy were like lets do Karokee. So the girl was
like no we are packing up for the night. So all sudden she puts on Shaian Twain
and hands me a cordless microphone. Well i just had to sing. I looked around and
amanda had went to the bathroom, and apparenty the girl ran into the bathroom and
handed her the microhone (cordless) So im siging my heart out, and all the sudden
Fexy emgers out of the bathroom, spot light goes on her, everyone starts chearing.
She busts in some high notes and holy hell we were awsome.
well that was a good weekend!
but ibest be off cams dad is hear to take us for dinner for his birthday.

Latley things have been really boring/dull with my life. I work, come home
wait for cams call, we chat and i do some exersize and go to bed,

Iv actutally became obsessed about it. Iv been trying to watch
everything i eat, or do. 
My pay cheak this week is going to suck, iv been taking vto lunches (volutary time off )
and coming into work at  6 every day instead one 1:00 so im losing all those hours.
I hate living away from cam, it sucks. I miss him alot.
Im kinda of excited though im getting a new car hopefully if the bank gives me a loan.
We are working on it, but its only 4000$ the guy is slasshing the price so i
really wanna buy it now. I wouldnt sell whitey to just anyone, i might sell it to Cam.
I wanna make sure it goes to someone i know. That car rules, i dont want a starnger having it.
Well anywho im going to do antoher update and add a bunch of pics from last weekends
adventure to the Mirage night club in Van. We had a alot of fun (me amand and jenna )

Kirenna passed out real early, and so did kim but im a tropper. i went to bed at like 4 or probley later then that. Fuck it kicked ass. Excpet for getting hit in the head which sucked. (my story of that is blurry becase i was pretty drunk) eww i hate saying ""i was drunk"" sounds trashy but i dont care. I got mad at cam for no reason i was so rude, i was makin him sleep on the other side of the tent..it was prety funny. then i felt bad....hahaha o well. Then we paid Cody to jump in the FREEZING river for like 30 bucks, and i was suppose to vidoe tape it with my camera. but i was prettty drunka and i had it on the wround settings, so none of it recorded, everyone waspissed. i got a hood full of moss for that one. Rob got shot in the leg (which i dont remember that happening) but i guess it was a big deal..is it cool if u dont remeber most of the night?

Thursday night i chilled wiht adam and shaun and jill and we meet up with a shit load of peeps at mc.dicks but we didint feel like going to the bailey so we just went back to my house, and feel asleep. Friday i stayed home. I was suppose to go to kiteraths party expcet my headace was killing me and it was to late for a ride when i felt better. so i stayed home and chilled. it was relaxing. last night we all drank at my house it was just me and jill, kitrenna, craige, spencer, lee, nick adam shaun brady and randy..we just chilled. (my dog tried to attack craig and nick and they screamed like lil girls) hahaha and craig jumped over my couch in fight (my dog is TINY) then We went up to a party at cluluts but we didint even go in. everyone i liked was outside so i didint see a point. just as we were leaving i saw cam and some other peeps pull up..it was werid..and sad..and odd...:(:(:(  then we went to mc.dicks which took forever but the food was so worht it. i was so hungrey. brady and randy and some other peeps (smoe guys i didintknow) came over and we all just kinda chilled. jill and kitrenna left and it was just me and randy,brady, shaun and adam and we all watched 13 the movie. everyone left and i cleaned up and passed out. so all togheter this weekend wasnt really that great. some good highlights are after jill and kitrenna jumped in the lake we saw a bunch of guys yelling. so me and jill ran over there and meet them all. they were all gross but it was funnny. then we were like ""we gotta go our rides leaving"" then one unknonw guy was like ""ill give you a ride"" then we were like ""bet you would"" okay so thats lame but thats a highlight which shows just how lame my weekend was.lol HAHAH tanya that kicked ass in ur survey when u mentioned aaron tolmey! AHHH her name just makes me mad FUCKIN CUNT hahahahahahah o god. i love you that kicks ass. I remeber strip poker with jason and all of them. o god. good times. ewww. anywho i dontknow what im doing tonight we dont have school tomorrow.

I still like him so much and i cant even believe we broke up. Its so harsh, i dont even klnow what to do. ITs sucks so much. I broke up wioth him, and it was the hardest thing i have ever done. He knew it was coming, and i think in a way hes relived. Cam just cant handle having one girl. Plus hes leaving soon, who know where. BUt he wants to get out of this town. He still wants to be best friends but i dont think i can do it. ITs just to hard, way to hard. We hugged for like 25 mins straight. He just keep saying he didnt want to let me go. It was intense. I fuckin hate this. Anywho im not to excited about spring break anymore.&nbsp; i hope everyone else had a good weekend...mine was good, expet for last night. I FUCKIN HATE SOME GIRLS, i cant belove some girls can be so harsh as to sit on peoples b/fs lap and stuff pissed me off.some girls need to know there boundres. Im ready to kick some ass.

"event","i deserve more.

i've known it for awhile but have been shoving it to the back of my mind for awhile now.

in what ways do i deserve more? i deserve someone who will care for me just as much as i care for them. someone who can bring to the table the values and priorities that i have. i want someone with the same drive, motivation and future opportunity as myself. granted, i don't want an exact copy of myself, but i need someone, at the very least, on my level.

he's simply not good enough. he's nowhere close.

as harsh, self-centered and egoistical as it may sound - he's not worth the trials and tribulations of that i've faced the past two years. there's no more 'fun' in this anymore. i shouldn't have let it develop past 'the fun'. something to remember for the future..."

"event","it used to be so simple. i'm trying to figure out when it got so complicated...

in short: i'm not happy. haven't been for a long time. there have been instances and occasions that i have been happy <i>for</i> people and the like - but it's never a long-lasting satisfaction. when the party's over, the high subsides and it's back to the real (read: unhappy) reality.

it's a far departure from my past self. i remember being the smiling optimist. happy-go-lucky, almost. i was stability, had a good head on my shoulders. i was a fucking rock. i was satisfied with my life, with everything that i had done and how it was going. then it all came crashing down. 

things weren't always like this. for awhile i was happy in this relationship. my friends didn't understand how or why, but they were supportive. i thought i had a good thing going until one of my greatest fears was realized - that i had been betrayed by someone i thought i knew, someone who i loved and thought i could trust... 

and as a result, i haven't been the same since. nowadays i'm always second-guessing my heart vs mind. i don't let myself love or trust like i did before. i can't. the rational part of my mind won't let me. i've been trying so hard for the past six months to get back to that happiness. i've tried giving it time, i've tried to rationalize it. i even tried fighting for it... still nothing.

i look at myself in the mirror and barely recognize the person staring back at me. 

am i a better person for staying in this? nope

do i have anything good to show for the past two years? nope

will i ever be happy again this relationship? ...

honestly, i don't want to keep waiting for that answer... if it hasn't come to light by now, it's probably not coming at all."

"event","i posted this a year ago - lessons from the front lines (of 'relationships')

1. tell the truth. if they don't believe you, leave.
2. long distance only works if you start out close.
3. alcohol makes everything look nice.
4. don't get involved with someone diagnosed with mental illness.
5. remember his name in the morning. remembering what he wore the night before doesn't cut it.
6. work the yellow fetish while you can
7. make sure your friends find you at the end of the night
8. don't accept another drink when you can't remember the previous five.
9. the man worth crying over is the man who will never make you cry.
10. the more he spends on the first date, the more he wants your pants off at the end of the night
11. make sure he tells the truth. if you don't believe it, leave.
12. communication is key.
13. never fall for the wingman.
14. money does not equal chemistry
15. if he can't take care of himself, how is he supposed to take care of you?
16. the ten-finger rule is there for a reason.
17. physical does not translate to emotional. and vice versa.
18. if he seems too good to be true, he definitely is. 

and the latest?

19. don't settle for anything less than you deserve."

in the past 49 days...

i have been the healthiest i've been in 2 years. i have saved in an INCREDIBLE amount of money, and have realized that staying in on a Saturday night in New York City (yes, NYC) isn't loserdom because i can accomplish SO much more than a hangover on Saturdays and Sundays (such as a 2 hr workout and getting misc shit done that i've been putting off for over a year).

but i broke that streak today with a couple glasses of white wine at the bar. harmless. 

almost harmless.

i think i'll moderate from now on. no more benders/blackouts/wastes.

with my family history, i need to look out for the long term. 

if daddy passed at 57 with barely drinking (due to a wheat allergy) and no drugs - i intend on keeping the slate quite clean. i'd like to think i'd make it past my kids' high school graduations and other assorted 'adult landmarks'. 

<hr>
the past 49 days...

have taught me a lot about myself and the people i hold close to my heart. at the risk of sounding like a hopeless sap - i know (yes, KNOW) that my life here would be meaningless without the the support of my family, the perseverance of my friends, and my dedication to living my life to the fullest of my expectations. this period of time has brought me into a state of health (and weight loss) that i haven't seen since my freeloading and money-scrapping days of NYU. 

it's truly refreshing to have that energy and stamina every morning i wake up. and to have that same motivation every night i go to sleep. 

sure - i may sound like a petty informercial or quick-money scheme on the surface...

<hr>
but i would recommend that everyone try it... stop drinking for a month. take inventory of your energy, your body, your health - physical AND emotional. take stock of who you are, what you've become, and what you TRULY want.

tell me that you're not for the better after the end of this 'experiment'.

year-end has not been kind to my family in the past. and it still proves to be the dark cloud on my otherwise happy parade of a year. 

two days ago marked the second year without my dad. and it feels like a lifetime. when i compare it to other 'two year landmarks' it is the one that feels the longest. 

i spent the day at home. when i was alone, all i could do was stare at the clock. counting down the exact minute my mom called me telling me, 'he's gone'... counting down the moment i crumpled to the wooden floors of my apartment screaming... counting down to the moment i lost half of myself. and when that moment came, it burned. the pain is a tiny bit duller, i didn't get nearly as depressed as i did last year... i guess that's progress.

and it's <b>fucking awesome.</b>

been going nonstop since the month began... and it's nice to be back in control. found my groove, and realized just how much i missed it. it's a sweet reunion. i promise i'll try not to lose it again ;)

in the process of reacquiring the 'groove', i realize i've neglected a lot this year. to those i've unintentionally alienated and/or lost touch with, i offer my apologies. i never meant to turn away or overlook your friendship. my friendships here are my family... as far as i'm concerned, we're all blood, one way or another.

to those who called the cards, saw past the bluffs, and threw out the lifesavers: thank you. thank you so much...

"event","the past wkend was a much needed break for all... the presence of the only kuya i have ever known only made the cause for partying more necessary. turns out everyone had a lot of shit to blow off from the past wk. 

thursday: kuya rolls into the apt late afternoon. after dinner at petite abeille, we chill at the apt for a few,  and i meet up with a friend for a quick drink. pat and i swing by fat black pussycat to pick up a very intoxicated tin, and we head over to off the wagon for sam's bday and beer pong madness. pat and i lose a game, then i get recruited by a towering blond by the name of frank who is desperate for a pong partner. we play.. and actually win... twice. pat ensures tin's safe ride home before crashing at the apt... i end up grabbing a slice with frank the tank, before i head home myself...

friday: wake up with hangover. barely make it to work on time. pat wanders around town and goes to macys. meet up at the apt later that afternoon, have dinner at highline with chris, kat, stan, and ed. go back to apt... keep making phone calls into late night... decide to conserve energy for partying tom night... crash

sat: brunch at tavern on the green with pat and ann, who is temporarily free from the grips of the quarter close. walk through central park. go shopping at time warner center. go back to apt. meet up with stan, chris, kat, and the paintball crowd at shake shack. pack away a couple cheeseburgers. go home. get ready. get set. pregame. patron, grey goose, bacardi, disaronno and hynotiq make an marked appearance. total headcount of 12 guys and 5 girls. walk to sway, cab to pdt, then cab again to bar 13. drink more. dance a little. notice pat go sleepy in the middle of kanye. cab home. pat's cousin's friend gets friendly. sent pat's cousin and his friendly friend home. crash at 4am.

sun: wake up, go back to sleep, then wake up again. brunch at bubby's. pack kuya up. see him off to airport. nap.

1. tell the truth. if they don't believe you, leave.
2. long distance only works if you start out close.
3. alcohol makes everything look nice.
4. don't get involved with someone diagnosed with mental illness.
5. remember his name in the morning. remembering what he wore the night before doesn't cut it.
6. work the yellow fetish while you can
7. make sure your friends find you at the end of the night
8. don't accept another drink when you can't remember the previous five.
9. the man worth crying over is the man who will never make you cry.
10. the more he spends on the first date, the more he wants your pants off at the end of the night
11. make sure he tells the truth. if you don't believe it, leave.
12. communication is key.
13. never fall for the wingman.
14. money does not equal chemistry
15. if he can't take care of himself, how is he supposed to take care of you?
16. the ten-finger rule is there for a reason.
17. physical does not translate to emotional. and vice versa.
18. if he seems too good to be true, he definitely is."

it's been a few months in the making... he's spent the bulk of this past month hanging out with a different circle of friends. before that he was away for a month of vacation. long story short - he's gotten used to being alone. and he likes it.

i can't say that it doesn't sting. but in the end, i didn't do anything, and there's nothing i could have done to salvage what was left.

YUP - seven days of texan familia, weather, and dog :)

it is always an interesting visit every time i go home. a period of time to take stock of many changes, both internal and external... it's been an ever-changing dynamic ever since i've left, and this visit back home proved no different... 

was successful in satisfying my unceasing craving for good, cheap steak and mexican food, stocking up on precious drive time, walk/runs around the neighborhood, goofy banter with familia, going out with the cousins... 

got a chance to clean up the house, have a long visit with dad, raid the fridge, dig through family pictures, art projects, papers, books, etc... found a few interesting pictures and even dug up my old stuffed big bird... he is now sitting on my bookshelf. i even snagged a book from my bro - recommended reading that combines my interests in boxing and african historical fiction...

Willstock 07 had a lot to hype to live up to after last year's festivities. although the crowd was smaller, it only fueled the boys' ambitions to continue on with the crazy antics. Will was gracious enough to rent a moonwalk, keep an arsenal of nerf guns and ammo, and feed us with the unending cooler of coldstone ice cream and home cooked italian food. we played drunken competitive wiffle ball, raged all-out nerf war in the bedroom, killed the beer, killed the food, almost killed the ice cream, and invented the most daring game i've come across in my life - to be only known here as 'Spoon'. i fell asleep on an armchair and woke up to a very drunk roy wrapping a blanket around me yeling - LIZ, WHERE IS YOUR BLANKET? I FOUND ONE FOR YOU! I AM TUCKING YOU IN, SEE? lmao... i walked out of willstock more exhausted than i arrived, and with only 3 hrs of sleep over 24 hrs... good times, good times.

Hanging with the Siddiqis/Arshipalooza was a food/sports/talk fest as well. The elusive big brother was finally introduced to us after 6 yrs of storytelling - and he kept a mean grill going. we played kickball during the day, ate and talked at night. played pool, ping pong, foosball into the wee hours of the morning. then, when we finally crashed for the night in the living room, the BOYS kept talking. who knew that guys could gossip so much! amazing the juice you find out when you pretend to be sleeping ;) after a lively round of 'Fuck, Marry, or Kill' we all crashed. we did a bit better this time - almost 5 hrs of sleep. lol.

thursday. after a madhouse day at our respective workplaces, ann and i almost miss our flight. arrive in miami ahead of schedule, and cab it to the hotel. the other girls checked in earlier that day, so we call them to let us in. no answer for 15 min. finally get to the room only to find out that they passed out from a happy hour that extended to a happy evening. ann and i grab din on ocean drive, then back to the hotel and crash. 

friday. wake up to cloudy skies. try on bikinis and heels. have pseudo modeling session on the balcony. cloudy skies turn to rain. sit in hotel all day and watch days of our lives and order dominos. ann gets a call from old college friend who rented a house for the wk in ft. lauderdale with 7 other guys. ann's friend picks us up and we all hang out at the house. we drink, laugh and be merry. ann's friend drops us off at the hotel to primp for the night. meet up with the boys again. go to mansion. drink and be merry part deux. dance till 3am. go back to hotel to pick up bikinis. go back to guys house to swim in pool. rain. fall asleep on couch.

saturday. wake up - sun finally decides to shine. go swimming with the girls in the pool. the boys pick up dunkin donuts for bfast. help clean up the previous night's party mess. ann's friend drops us off at hotel. say goodbye to the boys. walk around town. lay out. go back and primp again for the evening. hit up opium. drink and dance again. buy drinks. lots of drinks. dish fake fake names and digits. back to apt to sleep. 

sunday. wake up. sun is blasting. run down to lay out by pool. curse in front of small children while discussing menstruation, sex, and boys with aly and tin. get dirty looks. throw dirty looks back. play in pool for 2 hrs. go back to room to pack. check out of hotel and head to nikki beach for brunch. throw down amazing brunch and go lay out for the last time. get dark. finally. pick up luggage from hotel. catch flight back home.

flew in late thursday after work. caught up with the ninangs and tine, then slept for a bit and woke up early for commencement. after breakfast and more talking, the rest of the family arrived from the long drive - mom, bro, aunt, uncle, cousins, and the dog...

the ceremony was formal infused with a nice shot of humor... the deans and the speakers were cracking jokes, the graduates offering up a smart ass remark every so often... they even had a balloon drop :)

afterward, a champagne toast at alumni hall, then hanging out at tine's apt until her grad dinner. the dinner was decent enough... drinks flowed freely and lots of convo around the table. finally met ate ning's boyf (after <b>5 yrs</b> of only hearing about him)... 

after another nap, the kids go out on the town - warehouse district. i've decided that the incredibly cheap, laid-back austin scene is a welcome change from pricey pretentiousness of NYC... but the 2am close time is one bitter pill that i won't be able to swallow for awhile - if ever.

the next day, we hit the outlet malls at round rock. i roll through theory, esprit, bcbg maxazria, jcrew, and michael kors. i refuse to tell my mom how muh i spent. heavy hit to the bank account is noted in my salad diet for the remainder of the month. should be a helpful factor in these last few wks before miami. that evening, the university commencement, with one of the most gorgeous fireworks displays i've seen since the 4th of july in NY. we eat out again with the the family, go back to sis's apt to change, then hit the town again. we hit sixth street this time around... a bit young for my taste, but still fun, still cheap...

now it's sunday morning. my flight back to ny is in 5 hrs. and i've (finally) had an extended amount of time to observe the austin college scene (or what's left of it) from lil big sis... 

part of me wonders what life would be like right now if i had went to UT. it's one of the more poignant 'what ifs' i ask myself...

buy anyhoo - sis is done-zo. seeing the looks on the family's faces, we're all pretty damn proud. i think we all had a blast. and we're looking forward to the next one in 2011. when joe bro will be marching in front of the tower himself...

<hr>
it all started friday night. alyssa's bday at park. erik picked me up and we ended up walking the entire way to the park. the weather was amazing and the company decent enough :) took over an hour to get there... and surprisingly enough - my feet didn't hurt at end of the night - in 4 inch platforms, too...

a few interesting events: ran into more than a few nyu ppl - all boys. the requisite hugs and catch-up talk were in order - and all in front of erik. met a few more ppl from their crowd, danced it up a bit, drank it up a bit, then went home. 
 
saturday, alex had a bbq at the house. ann and i showed up around 4pm, partook in the burgers, steaks, hotdogs, skewers, and portabello mushrooms... played a few drinking games, smoked hookah, talked, ate again... erik showed up around 7pm, hung out a bit more, did a beer run, and eventually moved the party to baja... in jersey city.

another random bday girl - sherry - erik ended up knowing her from high school, and was also one of tin's friends. the crowd carried a heavy latin beat, and we started drinking and dancing accordingly. eventually a fight breaks out (this <b>is</b> jersey city, after all), we find out that one the guys involved was a friend of ours, and we make a quick exit shortly afterward. lugz offers to drive me all the way home - door to door service is great :)

<hr>
so the questions... started out as few and far between... now they're just downright incessant.

a few were subtle - alyssa asking me if i would stay single until our trip to miami - at the end of june...    

others not so much - ann asking me if we had 'the talk'... lugz asking for a 'status update'... jenny outright asking me if erik was my boyf... a total stranger asking me if he could dance with me - even though my 'boyfriend' was a few feet away... even my own mother is getting in on it...


it's coming to the point of annoyance. but, at the root of it all, is the lack of knowing where this could possibly go - and if it's worth pursuing in the first place.

met up with ann at southwest. started off with few glasses of wine. julius and orange met us up - then killed a few more bottles, cheese fries, chips and dip and salads (for the guys)...

spent a good chunk of the evening there - nearly shut the place down...

the views were amazing. the sunset (sooooo romantic...pfffft), the million dollar boats docked at the marina nearby, and the (almost as good as NY) skyline views of Jersey City were the finishing touches to freeflowing wine and convo...

friday night was one for the girls. shelley and ann came over for din and drinks. cleared a bottle of cab before heading over to eugene for a bday party. manage to get past the door and the obligatory frisking and bag searches in good time, but not before they nail us with cover charge... once inside, we find the bday girl, and start dancing the night away. the crowd was one of a very 'urban' persuasion - heavy rap, hip hop, and reggaeton were in heavy rotation. we all get picked off, one by one... i end up meeting a teacher named kevin, who also was there for a bday celebration. shel gets picked up by his friend, and ann disappears for a while as well... the night progresses - shelley and ann have a hilarious encounter with a bold filipino kid, then we decide to move to a more danceable environ.

shel suggests 40/40 - a mere block away. one the way over, we give directions to a guy named paul - looking for a place called room service... after a bit more convo, he soon became our new gay best friend. he ditched his party, and ended up coming to 40/40 with us. we find out that paul was born and raised in orange county, and is now working in barcelona for a company that caters to foreign students - covering everything from mobile devices to transportation. he's in nyc for a break - crashing at an apt that his boss lent him until the end of the month. 

more dancing and drinking ensues - paul is our little firecracker. he's bouncing off the walls, poaing, and cracking white gay man jokes left and right. and soon enough, we all get picked off one by one. this time, shelley gets snagged by a model, i am introduced to a towering, muscular fellow in a suit. 

in time, the lights come up - the music dims, and we all make our way home. paul and shel walk it back to union square, ann and i cab it back home. 

the next day - ann tells me that her and shel plan on telling erik that he better act fast - turns out that he may have a bit of competition. lol.

"event","there are three steps to a proper workout. the warmup, the core exercise, and the cooldown. they go in a specific order so as to prevent any injury that might result from a sudden, unexpected overexertion of the body. think of it as warming up a car during the winter, or foreplay before sex. yep. you got the idea.

every day i work out with al-fatir, he always puts me on a treadmill for 5 minutes. before any boxing, lifting, high intensity work, or core strengthening... i can always count on the five minute run the moment i walk in. that warmup gets the heart pumping, opens up the lungs, and jump starts the adrenaline push.

and at the end of the workout - the cooldown. a series of stretches that soothe and lengthen the muscles that have tightened up over the course of the workout, and ease your heart rate and breathing (and sometimes the mindset) back to a resting rate.

i've come to realize that relationships are a lot like workouts. two people get to know one another - find out about each other's personalities and interests, what makes the other person tick... if things look good - then move on to something more serious, exclusive...

... they don't ever get to see the cooldown."

"event","apparently i have a new nickname... jersey girl.

due to my newfound presence in hoboken and jersey city - i've already spent the last two wkends crossing state lines - all the new york kids are calling me 'jersey girl'.

last wkend - after a hellish commute via the PATH and light rail, finally made it to erik's place for his bday festivities. what would have normally taken 40 minutes took <b>over an hour and a half</b> due to construction... after a brief meeting with the familia, caught a ride across town and ended up at nanking - where a vermont crowd and around 40 of erik's friends gathered for the celebration. the next day is one of recovery, rehydration, and wii sports. we catch an early sushi dinner with the boys - and ann, finally recovered herself, drives us home... 

this wkend - started out early... ann and i made it out to hoboken thurs night. my expired driver's license denied entry to bahama's -<i> you have GOT to be kidding me </i>- and we ended up at black bear. met lugz, juanito and his friend, grey. erik, josh, rob and tin join us later. ann and i leave around 12:30 - grab dunkin donuts from across the street before calling it a night. 

the following night - sam's dinner party brought erik across the river :) he is finally introduced to my close crowd, and we 'bond' over pasta dinner and a very competitive round of taboo. ann drives in and picks us up and we head to bar none - in jersey, of course :P dancing and drinking ensue - we leave at 2:30 - pick up tacos, burritos, and chips and ann drives everyone back to their respective jersey crash pads. ann picks me up, with alex and rob in tow, and we head out for breakfast - but not before making a pit stop at a filipino bakery and stocking up on some soul foodin' goodness :)

then back to NY we went...

<hr>
i am soooo tired nowadays.. don't get me wrong - i have an amazing time with erik and the crowd, but the constant commuting across the river is exhausting. i honestly don't know how ann does it!

next wkend will be easy. i refuse to cross state lines :)"

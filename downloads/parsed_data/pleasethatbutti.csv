Lets see what did I do yesterday... hmm.. haha oh yeah orlando came over because he wasent doing anything lol, so we all went down to lindas house to eat.  For some reason me and orlando wouldnt stop laughing on our way there, haha we even started crackin up when the lady was praying and thanking god before we ate! lol funny shit..after eating we walked to the Safeway because orlando needed gloves lol, of course he didnt find the ""perfect ones"" and didnt buy anything, so we just walk cause orlando felt like walking haha. We watched ""eurotrip"" (which was hella funny) and ""white chicks"" lol.. 

After we took orlando home, and came home ourselfs.. some punkz wanted to talk to my brother out side, cuz Mark ass was talking shit about some female!? whats up with that my nigs, if nigga was talkin shit go talk to his ass about it! wthe fuck you doing trying to take it out on one of his friends??... Well if any of you feel the need to get peeps into other peoples shit, make sure u know who fuckin with first


Today:
I wasent gonna do anything today.. but Orlando and my bro wanted to go to the mall lol, of course we chilled here for a quick 30 and then left. While we were in the car, me and orlando started to crack up again for no reason lol, don't know why but everything just seems funny when its quite. When we got to the mall we went to go get some food, looked at some females of course, and then went out of the mall go get some drinks... what I got looked like beer so when we went back in the mall everyone was looking at me weird lol. A few mins later we saw THE cousins lol, they were just chillin with one of they're friends. When we were leaving my mom seemed kinda pissed off so we just droped orlando off at home. He WAS going to cut my hair, because he said he could? lol. Now im at home getting ready for who knows what. 

If you ever wanna chill, remember im BACK! 925 828 5704

When my mom dropped me back home I saw Orlando chillin lol, not knowing that him and my bro were gonna throw a BBQ lol.  A few peeps came over like my cousins, orlando, ray, and Ingrid! lol I didnt know most of them, but I guess they were koo? Well we had my bro make the BBQ and he burned all the food! haha. We played on the Ps2, shot hoops, and just chilled. I was going to invite peeps, so we could get it popin but it was getting late and we knew my dad was going to come home soon.

"event","Today was pretty sick, I'm back in San Ramon! fuck yah, lol my bro, orlando, and dallas went with my mom to pick me up from ""the ghetto"" lol, dallas had a pocket knife ready to stab any person haha. Once they picked me up we went to go buy some fresh fruit in the stretts (East 14) it was good shit, kinda spicy but you know its all good ha. After eating our fruits we HAD to hit up the best store in oakland... the ""1 dollar store"" haha we didnt buy anything, but we did jack some candy lol (it was only a dollar, im sure they didnt care).. It was only around 2 so we were hungry, we went to taco bell and between all of us ate 10 tacos, we sent Orlando to go buy a 2 liter of soda with the money we had left lol. It was getting late and Dallas had to get home, and also orlando had to go to work. SO we headed back and took them where they had to go. Now im just chillin in my crib waiting for tommaro so I can go out with my brother and have some fun lol. Well thats it for now...

"event","Wow today was a long day... 

First I woke up around 7 and started working out till about 9. After that I had to get ready to head down to the 9.2.5 and help Linda (my moms friend) clean her freakin yard lol. I mean who does she think I am, asking me to clean her yard! lol she probly thinks im like all the other mexicans!, but oh well shes gonna be paying hella bank so its all good. Now I see why most mexicans cut grass for a living, it pays good haha. I think I might have to go there at least 2-3 times more to be able to finish (more money for me lol, I can't wait to get paid!), lol i'll let all you know how much money I get.

My court date might come threw mail sometime this week?, so I'll let ya'll know what up with it.
""Lock'd up"" will be my song after court.. haha naw im straight, I aint gonna go to jail anytime soon...

I'm thinking about making my own CD, and start writing songs cuz im such a fucking genius, and random lyrics keep popin up in my head lol, who knows.. so lets see whats up with that.

Well thats all for today, I'll let ya'll know whats up tommaro"

But once I go back I will be attending Cal High once again, and hopefully I dont fuck up this time lol. I know all you peeps, especially you girls miss me and want me back lol. Once I go back its all gonna be ""Love in the club"" for yah. But believe it or not I will try to be commited to one special person, cause I have fucked up my relationship with her too much.. and I really like her so lets see what happens with that... I'm hella bord though, I was just talking to thomas about that whole basketball brawl that went down, I think that shit is crazy lol, but I can't even watch everything that happend cause someones always watching something on t.v in this house!, so someone record it for me... I finished Halo II today it only took me like 5-6 hours again haha, I'm a pro when it comes to video games, even though I don't play them too much..

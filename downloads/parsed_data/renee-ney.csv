Its so F*cking hot I want to kill my self.  Seriously 98 and humid... disgusting I am honestly running around NY in my bathing suit because I can't handel it.

I need a new job.  Why?  Well because I'm getting sucked into what i like to call ""Starbucks Life""  It's the point where the money is good enough and I have enough responsibility that I have to put my job befroe my carrer.  Make sense?  SO after 6 happy months I am quitting Starbucks.

Blood. (or giving blood cause I'm definatly a little pink)

Me and my friend thought it would be fun to do one of those dating service profiles since all the guys we know are more intrested in our brothers.  So a half an hour latter (yes it freakin' took a half hour) I finished and was REJECTED!  I was like ""WHAT!?!?!"" apparently they are unable to match 1 out of 5 people.  Say hello to Miss 20%!  A little pathetic...maybe I should have answered the questions a bit more truthfully.  Oh well only losers do that anyway.  Shut up.  
      So ANYWAY life is good, the weathers warmer I have a job at starbucks.  It is  suprisingly fun.  FAO schwartz hired me too and I was all excited until I found out they pay $5.25 an hour and treat their employees like a sweat shop in China.  Oh! Oh!  I totally get free coffee all the time so I am constantly on a caffeine high at work!  It's kind of amazing!  Ok I'll post again next month. Jeeezzz people call me sometimes...gawd..."

I can't wait to be home!  Seriously the past week has gone so slow so I can just imagine how slow this week will be.  I dunno, I kinda think it might be a little weird to be home after being away so long.  I'm expecting everyone and everything to be the same but obviously, in 6 months, things are bound to change.  What I enjoy the most is that I have talked to my brother and gotten to know him better since I moved away.  And my relationship with Coulby has gotten so distant that I can't even tell you anything about him. Funny. Okay, I'm off to dye my hair.

My government teacher says I have 16 unexcused absences (meaning I've ditched 16 times) EXCEPT I have only missed that class about 6 times and they were ALL excused.  Now a normal human being would be some what understanding, and maybe admit that they may have made a mistake...but no.  Mr. Flynn not only refuses to helpful but also says he is going to FAIL me if I do not ""clear up some of my absences.""  ok fine.  So I have my mom call and try to excuse days when I WASN'T ABSENT and the attendance office won't let her...ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  SO, she talks to one of the Vice Principals, possible the most stupid person on the planet, who tells my mother there is nothing he can do.  AND since goverment is a required class, if I fail it I don't graduate.  FUCK'IN A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

SO I've just spent the last twenty minutes trying to figure out how long it takes to get take/get results for the CHSPE and the GED...so that will be fun.  I'm talking to Mr. Flynn tomorrow to see if he is actually going to fail me...if he says he will than I'm dropping out that minute.

Last night was so much fun!  Instread of going to Denny's like we do after EVERY show (I'm sick of that place) WE went to Inn-m-Out.  Yummy Shakes and Fries...I turned in a job application but after how loud we were they won't ever hire me... I think me and Kevin sining a couple of lines from the Wild Party over and over didn't help (-Just tell me Berz why after seven years we have never been into the sack before?   -Kate don't bother me. -I'm just asking why -Whenwe met you were less than a DIRTY WHORE!!!)  And yeah, then a bunch of middel schoolers came and we were totaly laughing at them, they were laughing at us, and then I realized one of the little snot rags was my cousin, needless to say I embaressed him throughly!  

Changing gears...
The talent show is tommorow...yuck.  I'm going to suck, but I was okay with that before 'cause me and Coulby were going to do ""Sing"" and I was going to be in ""I wanna be a producer""  but now I'm not so I'm not looking forward to this at all.

Now off to find a new job and go shopping with Jenni!

I DROVE!!!

Anywho, thanks for not putting the vibrator in my locker morgan...I would have killed you.

I auditioned for AMDA this weeken it went fairly well.  I did my monoluges and my interview and went back into the waiting area finnaly relaxed cause it was all over.  BUT NO.  One of the audition people sat down next to me and asked me if I would sing to.  AHHHHHHHHH!!!  But I was like ""...ummm k.""  So I sang 'Not for life of me' from thouroughly modern millie.  It was... interesting.

AND I saw Into The Woods.  It was SO BAD!!!   The girl who replaced knew a total of FOUR words in the ENTIRE show... but apperently she knew more than me...stupid director.  Oh well after seeing the show I'm even happier I got kicked out because they had six people in the audience and they suxed."

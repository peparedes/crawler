It's like it's been set in stone the way in which to start a story. Give the reader something to think about. Then through the acts of the characters, the situations they get involved in, you hopefully get to the answer. Either it be by the end of a book, movie or Live journal entry. Substance is what always makes for an interesting read.

At work the other day we had a meeting. It was instigated by me because I felt like my work mates didn't like me. Because of this feeling I was acting as though they didn't, which then started making them dislike me. Things left unsaid cause ideas to formulate in peoples minds. We're not mind readers. I felt that they didn't want to work with me and because of that I projected myself in a way that made them not like me. Circles. It grew and grew so I had it brought up at work. Only one workmate really felt any animosity. It was just all a big misunderstanding.

People need to talk more. If we can bring up our issues and then move on, the world would be a more healthier place. The old saying ""the pen is mightier than the sword"". The sword can wage wars, the pen can stop them. We're not mind readers. With a bit more understanding and insight into whats bothering people we could do away with mixed signals. Away with doing something we regret or feeling things we not need to.

Life's too short for being caught up in problems we create in our own heads. If we're going to get pissed off at something at least let it be real. Not something we think somebody might have said or something we thought we heard. Fuck, that.

I came from a collection of experiences that spawned memories. I act on the memories I have of those experiences I've had. I grow from the experiences I have, which become new memories. I will grow, change and become. I am one with my universe which changes as I do.

Learn from the past. Create the future. Be happy. Boobs."

So now that I've gotten your attention... WHATS UP BITCHES!? You should check out that web-comic site. Is good.
<font size=""1"">(Note obvious plug...)</font>

NOw for some serious tone. I haven't been writing much lately because I've been working my arse off. Really. I've been working seven day weeks, 12 hours at a time. So not really in the writing mood. Though this is one vent I have neglected for far to long.

Right Side Brain: So here's my issue. I feel that people have it in for me. I'm insecure. 
Left Side Brain: <i>Wow! What else is new?</i>
RSB: Yeah thanks! Ha Ha. ^serious face^
LSB: <i>Well what is it you want to hear? How much people should be feeling sorry for you? Get fucked RSB. Suck it the</i> fuck <i> up! You know what your problem is? You don't take responsibility for your own actions. Do you really think everything is handed to you? That you don't have to earn things? Things like respect? Look I'll give you Trust. You have lots of Trustworthiness about you. One up on RSB!</i>
RSB: One up on you too. We are the same person. We just perform different cognitive responses.
<font size=""1"">(Note: This is only theoretical because I don't know for sure in the slightest.)</font>
LSB:<i>Yeah well I'm better. I'm on the left. Score!</i>

What my respective sides of my brain are saying is correct. Because I wrote it. And I know me. Well kind of. I'd like to know all my pressure points and what they do to me. I suppose now is not the time for experiments.

At this time in my life I have a lot of reoccurring states of being. I'm over taking peoples shit. The catch to that is I'm good at dealing it. I need to really think about what I say, if I should say anything.

I need to not give people reason to do/say things to me that I don't like. Because there is a reason for everything. People call you fat because you are. People call you Asian because you are. People don't talk to you about issues because you're not good at responding. People don't want to hang out with you because you're a boring cunt. It's nature. It's why cheese is yellow. Because it is.

I'll tell you the weirdest thing that's happened to me recently. I smoked some fucking good weed. I don't know if it was laced with anything. Because how I acquired this bud'ly goodness was at a club from a random's girlfriend I don't know. He told me to ask his girlfriend for some bud. And bud I got. For a nice blue tenner I got's me a good couple of grams. And it was good. I didn't touch any that night because I was already buzzing on coke and E. But the following Thursday I had some and it was good. I went to bed because I had work nice and early. Then I woke up on Friday and I was still fucked. I mean my short term memory was shot to shit and I felt like nothing was real. Every question thrown my way I tried to answer the soberest I could. But I couldn't remember what I said to whom. Then Saturday came around. And again I was feeling the same. No short term memory. Fucked sense of reality. I became really paranoid that I had fucked myself up. <font size=""1"">(Note: An effect caused by said weed. It's easier to recognize sober.)</font> I thought maybe I should take some more. Maybe that would reset my brain! AND GUESS WHAT?! It didn't ^serious face^. In fact I was fucked again for almost three days.

I was scared my boss knew (Not a huge fan). I was scared my Dad knew. Everyone was asking if I was ok.

""Yeah. Just had a shit night sleep.""

But it wasn't until after that third day that I was again ok. But pretty fucked up. And now I want to do it again. But I need a week holiday. Why these compulsions to get fucked up? The same reasons I think nearly everyday I should quit my job. Or leave my house mates and move somewhere else. Because I feel people don't want me around. Because I have this great sense of worthlessness. It's this up hill battle of trying to get things right. Is it the drug abuse? Maybe. Fuck why not! A BIG YES! Get fucked. I'm not a huge drug-o <font size=""1"">(LSB: Yeah... you're not! Pfft. ^serious face^)</font>

Ok... I'll sum it up for you. I haven't had a relationship for over two years. Even sexual intimacy has been neglected. Not even a pash for two years. Maybe more. It's getting on three. And I'm 21. But whose fault is that?

Mine.

So I have to say, I'm not writing this for sympathy. Because I'm not. I don't care if anyone reads this. But I write it because I need to vent and I have no one to vent to. Or I <i>feel</i> I have no one to vent to. I feel like every cunt hates me. Ha Ha Yeah ^serious face^.

I'm depressed. I need to hang with some happenin' bros. Go getters. Go getters fucked, they'd say. Ha.

Well I'll leave you with an old bad joke.

Q: How do you cancel an appointment with a sperm-bank?

A: Tell them you can't come."

Well where to start? HOW YA BEEN LJ?! LONG TIME NO SEE! Don't know if anyones noticed but I've been a pretty busy boy. In dot form I've:

- Moved out of Home
- Had my little brothers Deb
- Piss farted around studying my final exams to become an Electrician.

So I'm still all doing that. I haven't had much luck in love over the last year and a half. In other words I'm still single. YES! It means I can keep the little amount of money I have for me. I haven't been going out much lately either. So no one-nighters. Not that that's ever happened before. But I've certainly scrapped my chances.

Works been pretty... busy. I've been doing tonnes. Driving heavy machinery, working on cool shit and even disconnecting stuff for the Arson Squad.

So lets recap. I've:

Moved out of home. To this place here. That's my car! Which I'm trying to sell by the way.

Got to disconnect stuff for the Arson Squad. Which was awesome. The heat off this thing caused cars to melt near it. Oh it was a Car Yard Office. Which might explain the

"event","So anyhoos... I've been saving up my money for moving out for a while now. And by awhile, I mean since the start of the holidays. And by saving, I mean I haven't spent my holiday pay. And by money I meant $2000. But then things happened. Things which saw my little money pot shrink.

Like Christmas. How wonderful it was. Fucken stupid Christmas. I mean it'd be great if my Family was just that... a family. While I have Italian heritage in me, family doesn't play a huge roll. My whole Christmas involved handing presents to people I didn't want to spend time with. Alot of its my fault. I feel that way. I feel like my bastard family doesn't mean anything to me. Sometimes. I like my family, but at the same time I wish I wasn't forced into family ""things and events"" like Christmas and Birthdays. Yeah, I'm a scrooge. So that was $450 down for ""presents"". The only ones appreciated were the ones I gave to my Sister and youngest Brother. GAH!

So that left me with $1550 in the ""Moving Out Kitty"". That's ok. Well... except for the $1000 worth of bills I had over the holidays. So yeah... $550.

Then there's New Years. Which was smashing by the way. Awkward feelings and shit. Hanging around people I didn't know. Unable to adapt to the situation. My New Years was ok. I was once again naked bringing in 2007. Which was fine. Though I think spending $30 on weed was a little stupid. I had an awesome high... at 9pm 31-12-2006. Followed by paranoid delusions up until 2007. So that didn't help to the mood. Or my ""Moving Out Cat""... meow! I appreciated Adam inviting us to the shindig, but I was too stupid to enjoy it. I mean I was that smashed I was paranoid about rolling another joint. I only had one joint the whole New Years. Pretty weak. But considering I haven't smoked for ages it did the trick. And I had heaps left over.

Then went out for dinner the other night with the fellas. $20 down the sploosh. It was worth it. And now, today, I needed some petrol for my car. $89 later... I need at least $600 to move out. I have $400ish. So I'm feeling pretty good. I worked a day during my holidays so I have $150 owing to me. Which is good. So it's not that bad. But fuck... I wish it was easier. Also looking for places.

It brings me to another thing I wanted to write about. Where the fuck have I been the last few months? I mean... I haven't written for ages. I think it's due to that fact my life has become boring. I mean... around August I was promoted at work. A nice pay increase. And more responsibility. Taking full advantage of this extra responsibility meant pissing off my co-workers whose goal it is not to make money for the business, but rather get paid for doing shit all. My insistence of work ate into their ""fuck-around"" time. So yeah... I've been busy and with not alot actually happening to me.

It actually has me in quite a depressed state. It's only since holidays started that I've had time to sleep and get stoned enough to relax and enjoy a little. Also some inspiration came from reading some past blogs/comics/forums. I mean there was a time where I thought the word ""mint"" was awesome sauce. Mint. That's mint. I'm going to bring that back. ""That's mint!"". It's my mission for 2007.

Another thing I'm finding is my LJ friends aren't posting as much. Thus proving the argument ""Alot of people have lives"". But it's not just here that no body has time. It's everywhere. The end of 2006 was a hard one. Alot of careers were taking off. Most of my uni based friends had exams and were finishing off their courses. 2007 brings a new life into... our life!

So I have some goals pending my escape from the ""coop"":

- I will lose weight. My goal is 75kg. My current weight is 97.8kg.
(Funny thing though, it seems everyones goal is to lose weight. Even dangerously skinny women who are trying to become models. Different issue but.)

- Save money.
- Have fun. Enjoy the outdoors. Ride a bike. Climb mountains. Go swimming. Get out there. That's what weekends are for. (Also helps my losing weight goal)
- Meet new people. Enjoy people.
- Read alot more. Reading improves linguistics. Moving stuff is logistics. Reading gives me information to converse with people while helping them move. ;)

It's not already things I didn't have to improve in 2006 or earlier. By moving out though, I hope to be around like minded people. People who I can have fun with. Arguments with. People who will tell it like it is.

Oh man. I had a haircut today. Man I'm sexy.

Well I'm off to bed. In order for me to get into some kind of routine I need to go to work. Well... I'm helping my Dad tomorrow at his work. That way I can still slack off. And not be paid for it. Also might give me a chance to actually talk to my Dad. Which I don't do often enough.

Man been so busy with work. Not much of a life though. That's all it seems to be about now. Work. I've lost my ability to talk to people. Had my cousin over just before... I could sense the awkwardness. I couldn't find words to talk. I'm losing my grip on talking to people. My ""charm"".

I used to be able to make people feel comfortable talking to me. They'd be willing to just talk about anything. Now I can't get anything out. I'm losing my humanity.

I backed into a car not so long ago. Just realised something. I had a chance to just drive away. But I stayed and talked to the owner and tried to sort something out. I haven't heard anything back. It sort of feels like it's one black mark against my name. Because I haven't heard anything... if I do something wrong or bad then it might crop up on me. And if I drove away care free? Well I didn't notice but there was a witness. I only noticed because I stayed back. It's like there was two paths I could have taken. To drive off would mean I would still get caught out. And worse. And to stay meant that for now I've heard nothing from the owner of the car I backed into. I did something wrong and accepted that I did and I've been let off. For now. My insurance premium is something like $500... which I don't have right now. I think the lesson I've learned here is that when you fuck up... and its your fault... you should take responsibility for it. You'll learn from the mistake, learn to reverse maybe... and at least it doesn't haunt me. I think I'll be ready for the premium when it comes around. I deserve it.

I'm not making the most of everyday I have... My life has become all about routine. I need a change. I need to spice it up.

I miss human interaction. I've lost it somewhere. In my messy room..."

"event","It's been since September since I wrote in here. Wow. And it's been longer since I wrote something meaningful. What I mean by that is a post that doesn't link to something funny I've seen. Also trying to make this post at least a little longer than two paragraphs. Wow!

So I'll recap on the past few months events...

It was my younger brothers 16th birthday and my friend Okey's 21st birthday on the same weekend. 5th and 4th of November respectively.

My laptop died toward the end of October. Which then led to an impromptu trip to Sydney for 5 hours.
I have photos. But I'm saving that for later... or never. As I said... my laptop died. It was my main computer and had alot of everything on it. My photos are on my USB stick and this computer doesn't have front USB ports and is a bitch to move around. So later.

I saw an old friend this Sunday gone. She was the sister of an old friend who I don't speak to now. Just over 2 years now since I spoke to them. It was a nice catch up. Not much has changed. Or more to the point I think it reminded me of how I used to be. And it was fun. I haven't had much interaction with people since me and Karina broke up. Even less since Creeky left for good ol' England. Yeah my close mates are always there... but we all have careers to build. Time for relaxing and fun remain minimal. Sudden visits and trips are most welcome. It forces me to jump out of my comfort zone and enjoy new things. So I really have to thank CJ and Mat for here now for listening to my plans of travel to Sydney. And I have to thank Claire for the visit. Even though she was burnt out from a huge weekend of partying. It brings everything into perspective. And both counts of impromptu resulted in a good week of smiles.

I'm buying my first suit this weekend. We have a work Christmas breakup with a dress code. I'm giddy. I usually don't go out much. Theres lots of reasons. Theres one reason. I don't put myself out there. Offers come and go... and then the offers don't come anymore. But I am enjoying work. Even though life outside of work consists of sleep. Up until Christmas I'll be working 6 days per week. It's not that long to go, but Sundays is my day of sleeping in and watching shit. Or doing more work for myself. To keep the routine up. The following few weekends will be full of fun though. I have Mat's 21st to attend. Which is going to be awesome!!! The work function, SUIT UP! I have a boys night out Thursday which is going to be good. I'm going to be fucked on Friday. And then Christmas... Holidays. Moving out.

I drilled into the side of my hand today. It hurts. Lol. Just looking at it now. It's still bleeding. I can just see it getting infected like the chunk out of my knuckle. Piss me off.

Not having my laptop is really hard. Its made alot of room for sleep. Which is a good thing I think. This is a pretty full on time of the year. And to have distractions such as this can become a killer. But I really love my job. The people. The money. OMG THE MONEYZ! I have a *secret awesome* container full of fifty and hundred dollar notes. Its my moving out fund. It's going to come in handy also for my suit buying. And present buying. I'm not going to go all out for Christmas this year. Everyone can get a card. And my nephew, siblings and my parents (both pairs) can get something. Small.

Anyways... work... bed... catch peeps. I thought I'd make just a quickish one. I wanted longer but I'm fucked.

Sorry for being recluse. Lol!"

Anyhoos, I've fallen in love with a Meat Loaf song. Sad? Not really. Because this song is awesome. It tells the story of man reflecting upon his childhood. A man who made a promise of marriage so he could get some... ;) The man in this story is true to his word. He promised he would love this woman till the end of time. Alas, he is now waiting for the end of time.

It's fucken awesome. Man take girl out for some ""hey, heys"" and is ""forced"" into marriage. Years later he's regretting this. Of course no one is ever forced these days. But this was the 70's!

So for some education here is the lyrics for...

<div align=""center""><font size=""4""><strong>Paradise By The Dashboard Light</strong></font>
</div>
<div align=""center""><em>Boy:
I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Girl:
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed

Boy:
Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby doncha hear my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun

And I gotta let ya know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonley in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Paradise by the dashboard light

You got to do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely--

We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go allt he way
An tonight's the night...

Radio Broadcast:
Ok, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker
going here, two down, nobody on, no score,
bottom of the ninth, there's the wind-up and
there it is, a line shot up the middle, look
at him go. This boy can really fly!
He's rounding first and really turning it on
now, he's not letting up at all, he's gonna
try for second; the ball is bobbled out in center,
and here comes the throw, and what a throw!
He's gonna slide in head first, here he comes, he's out!
No, wait, safe--safe at second base, this kid really
makes things happen out there.
Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch--
he's going, and what a jump he's got, he's trying
for third, here's the throw, it's in the dirt--
safe at third! Holy cow, stolen base!
He's taking a pretty big lead out there, almost
daring him to try and pick him off. The pitcher
glance over, winds up, and it's bunted, bunted
down the third base line, the suicide squeeze in on!
Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close,
here's the throw, there's the play at the plate,
holy cow, I think he's gonna make it!

Girl:
Stop right there!
I gotta know right now!
Before we go any further--!

Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?
Do you love me!?
Will you love me forever!?
Do you need me!?
Will you never leave me!?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life!?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife!?
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me!!!?
Will you love me forever!!!?

Boy:
Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you my answer in the morning

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you my answer in the morning

Let me sleep on it
Baby, baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
And I'll give you my answer in the morning

Boy:
Let me sleep on it!!!

Girl:
Will you love me forever!!!

Boy:
I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god and on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!

So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you!!!

Boy:
It was long ago and it was far away
and it was so much better than it is today

Girl:
It never felt so good
It never felt so right
And we were glowing like
A metal on the edge of a knife</em></div>

And there you have it. Awesome fun. And just for completeness here is the video:
<span class=""ljvideo"">http://www.youtube.com/v/tW1N2FbaX1A</span>

For a bit of history and knowledge, because I try and ensure people take something away from my ramblings, the woman in the video is Karla DeVito. Meat Loaf and her did the stage act during tour, but the original singer was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Foley"">Ellen Foley</a>. Ellen never performed with Meat Loaf live for this track. Also Meat Loaf didn't write this song, yet it was written for him by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Steinman"">Jim Steinman</a>. Meat Loaf himself even describes this track as ""Disneyesque. Only with an R rating.""

It's playful, fun and also has a poke at conventional ""love"" songs (pardon the pun).

Pffttt!!!



Oh and before I forget... just to cover up a more serious matter with bullshit, lol, I've recieved my results from the doctor. What for? For my testicals. I found a lump about a month ago. I had it checked out, then ultrasounded and everythings ok. I now have a giant film (film as in photo ""film"" not movie film) of my balls. And my kidneys (used to test the machine?). What it was, was an oversized vein. Probably a pressure build up from under use... or, more likely, needing to get more blood flow there from over use. Lol. Flying solo! ;) It could be permanent or go over time. Either way my lads are ok and are still working. This was a scare for me and it could have been worse than it was. So just letting you guys out there know... check your balls. I know you all have them in your hands at least a few times a week, so you might as well do something productive once in a while. I say it in a joking way... but I'm serious 0_0

Have fun!

P.S. I'm thinking about making a user pic out of my left nut. Lol. The ultrasounded one. It would be awesomely funny...

P.P.S. Actually I did make something. But here's the original... Pffft!

<img src=""http://lithik.ath.cx:800/my_left_nut.jpg"">

My screen when set to white makes a good x-ray viewer. The scan didn't turn out well. But never the less... My Left Nut!

"event","Well I've finally done something on my To Do list which has been on there for the better part of a year. And no... it's not do my Re-Sits. Pffftt. I've finally cleaned out my In-Box. And not the virtual one either. My real life In-Box with actual paper and shit. Why does this make me feel good? Well... because! It's off my LIST! YEAH! So what else is still on my list...<br /><br />Justin's To Do List.<br /><br />- Get a new Doona.<br />The story behind this is, I needed a new battery for my car and Barb paid for it. She said to pay her back I'd just have to get a new doona for myself. This was at the start of the year. *sigh* lol.<br /><br />- Do backdated profiling.<br />Yeah... 3 years ago as part of my apprenticeship I need to write down everything I do. Yeah... 3 years ago. I should get on that.<br /><br />- Do Re-sits. (Due 24th April 2006)<br />Yeah... again I should get on that. I have Re-Sits to do before I can sit my final exams for my apprenticeship. Must get on it.<br /><br />- Do Trav Pictures.<br />Well me and my best mates have this <a href=""http://travolta.ath.cx"">site</a>. I manage the pictures section. Which hasn't been updated since (checks) OMFG! For 2 years now. LMAO. I really should get on that. But unfortunatly everyone is busy doing their own thing and the site doesn't get visited as much as it used to. Stupid life getting in the way.<br /><br />- Get PCPP Subcription.<br />For my 20th birthday my mates bought me a PCPP mag and gave me moneys especially for a subscription. Yeah... I still need to do that.<br /><br />- Get my bartenders licence.<br />Something I just wanted to get. I was thinking I might get a job at the local bar when I move out. Cheap drinks then. And I get to meet more people. It was an idea I'm still hoping to pursue.<br /><br />- Sign up for SES.<br />Another idea I had to meet more people. Also would fill my need to give back to the community.<br /><br />- Give Blood.<br />I don't know my blood type. And I thought this might help. Also because I know I'm one of the few people who can give blood and I hope I can help someone. Giving back.<br /><br />- Get A3 frame.<br />I have some certificates which I want to frame so I can hang them up and show off how good I am. To <em>all</em> the people that visit me. Lol.<br /><br />- Do Tax<br />This is one which will probably get done within the next week. See, for cleaning out my In-Box I sorted out all my reciepts and shit. And.... done! Well not yet.<br /><br /><br /><br />So that's my list. I also have a weight loss thing I want to do. But probably won't. Because I'm lazy. It's hard to change how I am. Lazy. No need to strive for anything. I have big ideas. I was having a convo to someone about how I'm a ""wannabe"". I wannabe more fit. I wannabe better at sports. I wannabe tidy. I wannabe someone who can offer something to someone else. But I never do.<br /><br />Aside from all that I've found this while bumming around You-Tube the other day. Interesting shit.<br /><br /><span class=""ljvideo"">http://www.youtube.com/v/GCjSwr7zYtE</span><br /><br />Night!<br />"

Anyhoos it all started many moons ago. My good friend Creek decided he wanted to go and live in England. This of course put me in a bit of a pickle. I mean it was Creek! The Man of Style. The Man of Cultural Knowledge. Simply ""The Man"". I was sad. I still am. So a weekend of awesome camping fun was orga'lized. Then the ""weekend"" became half a week. And so on the 27th of July we left. Creek, Mat, Okey, Bassett and myself. There was supposed to me many others coming with us... but Creek's not important enough to them. Lol. They hate it when I say that.

Anyways it ended up being just us. Unfortunately Okey had to return home Friday night because of other arrangements. He was missed. Bassett also left early... eh. Lol.

So Thursday began with me waking up. That was the exact moment Thursday began. Before I woke up it was still Wednesday. Believe me. I know. *cough* Anyway, I got up (you can tell this is going to be a long post. Hey, just for laughs I also have 90 pictures attached to the end of this.) and got quickly ready. My sister came over Wednesday night and I offered to take her home Thursday because it was on the way. So we drive to Brunswick around 9:30am ish. On the way Candice is commenting on how bad my driving is. I retort with the fact that ""if people did the speed limit then I wouldn't have to dodge them when I try to."" People piss me off. Crap driving is one of my pet hates. Just because everyone is driving slow and I'm not doesn't mean I'm speeding. I just trying to do the speed limit, which happens to be faster than everyone is traveling at.

We made it to Creeks place alive. Isn't that want anyone could ask for? Creek was still really tired having worked till 4am Wednesday night (it didn't become Thursday until I woke up at 9. Remember?). So we helped him pack and loaded our shit up and were out of there at 10:45am ish. I told Candice I'd have her back home in Geelong at 12. An hour was pushing it. Especially during a week day and through the city. Long story short I had her home at 12:07pm. Thats good going. I would have had her home earlier if I didn't go her crazy way through Geelong. That's another thing that pisses me off. People giving me directions when I know where I'm going. Just because my way is different doesn't mean it's wrong. Usually it's faster. I love my maps.

So with Candice out of the way I burn around to Creek's Mum's place so he can get more shit for us. Then I burn around to Bassett's place. He was already ready. Good. He asked where Creek was... I told him the trip was ""in memory of Creek"" and he was never coming. He knew I was lying. But didn't care too much. Then I burned around to Mat's place. Told Mat Creek wasn't coming either. He hated that. Bummed around there for a bit. Then Okey rocked up. Asked where Creek was. Told them he wasn't coming. So Okey has his Maccas and Mat gets all packed up and I tell everyone lets get going.
""What about Creek?""
""I told you...""
So we get out to the cars, Mine and Okey's red rocket.
""I'll meet you at Creek's Mum's Place, bye.""
Bassett and I jump into my poo-coloured rocket and we fang around to Creek's Mum's place. Bass and I beat them there and Creek is in his parent's room trying on his Mum's clothes.
<em><font size=""1"">Note: Creek trying on his Mum's clothes may not have actually happened.</font></em>
We hear Okey and Mat rock up so I suggest we hide. Creek hide's behind his Mum's bed, Bassett being a cupboard or something and I crouch in the middle of the floor. I was never meant to be a Co-op Soldier. Okey and Mat walk inside calling out to us. Nothing. So they make out like they're going to rob the place.
""Let's take all this nice stuff!""
Best prank ever! O_O

After packing all our stuff in Okey's and Mine cars we head out... TO THE GRAMPIANS!

The drive up was interesting. Because Okey was following and driving like a bitch I soon lost sight of him. I was doing the speed limit. Slow drivers... lol. So me and Creek have this idea. What if I stop somewhere and hide, let them pass and follow <em>them</em>! So for the next 30 min I'm looking out for a spot. And there it was! A side street. So I tear in there and do a U-Turn and wait. Okey and Mat cruise past never even looking our way. And after letting another car pass I pulled out and started to follow. It was a pity the car I was following was one of the stupid drivers that do 10km below the speed limit. So I go around him and I'm following Okey about 100m behind. Nothing. Not even a notice. Naughty Okey doesn't check his rear mirror often. Lol. So I call up Mat.
""Where the hell are you guys?!"" I say.
""We're doing the speed limit.""
""Bull shit. I'm doing a 100. And I can't even see you guys anymore."" I say.
""Yeah well, good for you.""
""Hey wait a minute...""
""What?""
""What's that up ahead? Hey Mat... I think... I think I've just lapped you guys.""
""Yeah ok..."" Mat looks back... ""OMG! HAH! <em>hey okey they're behind us.</em>""
""Man you guys are so slow! I've lapped you!""

Man it was funny. Anyhoos, we made a stop in Ballarat. Bassett bought a PCPowerPlay Mag and thus was unable of communication for the rest of the trip. And I made a stop into Dick Smith to try and get a GPS device. No, not a Road Nav but a GPS for co-ordinance and stuff. I'm trying to get into a ""new"" kind of ""sport"". I think I made a post earlier... hang on I'll go check.

Go here... it's here http://travolta.ath.cx/index.php?xml=Forum/General-Discussion-2006&amp;xsl=forum&amp;forumList=XML/Forum-Current&amp;offset=9

Anyways. It's called Geo-Caching. It's awesome.

So I couldn't find a GPS. But I wasn't going to leave there until I bought something. So I decided that I'd buy some walkie-talkies. $100 bucks. I figured that since we're travelling in two cars it's be nice to be able to chat considering phone reception sometimes dropped. So we left there and headed over to Subway. Yum! We played with that there until we had enough and got on our way. New toys in hand. They came in useful for roo spotting since I almost clean up a few on the way.

We're driving around and we stumble onto this burnt out dunny. The Grampians had massive bushfires Jan/Feb this year and alot of things became burnt out. This toilet used to be connected to a house. I know because the owner pulled up and told me. He thought we were friends of his and totally ruined our photo moment. Thats coming later... TOILET SHOT! He was a helpful country person. He told us that some of the free campsites have been closed due to fire. Also told us the road ahead was undrivable. He gave us an alternate route and we thanked him and went on our way.

Driving to our pre-planned camp site we came across ""Road Closed"" signs. So I pull up to the sign with Creek and Bass in the car. This was ""seemingly"" the only thing in the way of our camp site. A stupid yellow sign. And for some reason Bass became all annoyed.
""It's says Road Closed. It's closed for a reason.""
""But I want to go down there.""
""Why?! It's closed!""
""*sigh* Fine. You get out and I'll pick you up if I come back.""

And then I drove around the sign. Okey and Mat decided to stay back. And in the dark, a few meters beyond the sign was a massive tree across the road. No way around. Defeated I drove back to the road.

Bass, ""See! What was the point of that?""
""Because now I know. Now I know why it was closed. Instead of just going through life believing everything I'm told.""
""But didn't you say earlier that was the problem with humans is not listening to the advice of the people who know?""
""Yes. But I'm human. I have that problem.""
<font size=""1""><em>Another Note: This is just and idea of what was said. It's pretty much word for word, but it </em>was<em> a week ago. Also it was very heated the conversation.</em></font>

See during the drive up I told Bass and Creek about how human beings are stupid because they don't listen to the advice history tells us. And some old people. See someone who has been in a situation, say, similar to mine would tell me not to do certian things because ""this"" and ""that"" will happen. In all honesty it is good advice. But I'd continue on my path of failing and when I do fail I think ""maybe I should have listened"". And that's the problem with humans. We have to experience. If we don't actually make those mistakes ourselves then all advice goes out the window. Thus we ""evolve"" slower than we should. Alot of history is repeating. Take America occupying Iraq. England did that in the late 20's. Removed the old Goverment and nothing changed except the death toll. And that went up.

Here's one of many sites for those interested; http://www.informationwar.org/state%20terrorism/Britain_using_chemical_weapons.htm

Anyway, people don't learn. All I was doing was proving that I am infact human. I was up for the adventure. Alot of people aren't. Good on them. And thus began the shit.

With our goal burnt out we headed further out from Halls Gap. And found a nice little camping spot. It was dark and so using the lights from our cars we set up camp. Got the fire burning and had tea. Then started drinking. Sometime in the night some other convoy of people set up camp. Mat was making loud suggestions to them to leave. But nothing direct. Lol.

As the night progressed Creek and Bass went to bed and we became three. And for a while there I went to bed. But I couldn't stand sleeping when shit's going down. I usually don't sleep unless my body forces me too so it wasn't that bad. But then I couldn't stand it any longer. And while Okey and Mat were singing and talking I drifted off to sleep, worried they wouldn't know how to put out the fire properly or if they worried at all. Honestly. I was worried about proper fire etiquette. I always have this feeling that people can't do shit right. I'm usually wrong. And I was. Good boys.

Of course I woke up first. Waking up at 5am everyday on 5-6 hours sleep does that to me. So while everyone was asleep I cut some more wood and got the fire going again (which was nicely put out the night before) and got breakfast on the go. Okey came out first. Then Bass. Then Mat was up but still in his sleeping bag. And we had breakfast and packed up. I helped where I could, but I was more focused on chucking the hatchet at the trees. I'm so good. Lol.

So packed up and ready to go we headed to the National Park information centre and read about the fires. Creek got some information about what walks were open and we drove into Halls Gap. We pulled up to the Lakeside Camp Park and hooked up a cabin. Number 11. I suggested to Bass that he go home with Okey to save him some money. Also so he wouldn't bring down the mood. We asked if Bass and Okey could shower in the park and it was cool. For 10 fucken bucks. *sigh*. We went to the cabin and setup our shit. Then had showers. After everyone was nice and refreshed it was lunch time. So we headed into Halls Gap Center. After an awesome curry pie and almost getting shitted on by a magpie we headed up to the Grampians highest peak Mt. William. This way Okey and Bass could enjoy the best the Grampians had to offer. And a long walked followed.

Walking up I became seperated from the group. I found an awesome cliff I was trying to take a photo of myself on. But the ten second timer wasn't good enough. So I'm walking the track and I notice it's winding around the mountain. I figure if I take the ""dirt"" track then I'd make it to the top faster. I was wrong. It was harder. Bushes to dodge and rock's to climb. I did my best. And when I had enough I jumped back onto the track. And who do I bump into? Creek! He was taking photos also. Enjoying the view on the way up. So I suggest we could beat the others by climbing straight up. So we do some more rock climbing. Taking some awesome shots. Almost to the top I hear Mat and Okey yelling out to us. I look up and at the summit there they are... standing! Looking happy. Lol. Piss me off. I wanted to beat them up. To the top of the mountain... lol. So we make it to the top and there's a Telstra transmitter station there. And an awesome ""sun dial"". It had arrows on it and it said things like;
""The Pinnacle 260m"" M for Miles. We use Kilometers in Australia so that ""sun dial"" was old. Ha!

And after a while of awesome views it was getting cold and so we headed back down to the car. Of course Okey, Mat and Bass walked on ahead. Lol. Me and Creek took it easy and checked out some more shit. And that shot I couldn't get with the timer on my camera Creek took for me. Thanks mate!

Back down we headed back to the cabin for tea. Okey and I took up the cooking job and headed to the BBQ's in the public area armed with oil, sausages, onions and tofu. Okey didn't put the cap back on the oil, another of my pet hates, and thus he spilt it everywhere. I made sure he knew I don't like people leaving the lids off things and used the spillage as an example. Lol. He hated that. I love stirring people up. But all the same. Lids go straight back on! Two reasons. 1. is spillage as was dicussed. 2. is all about lifestyle. See the way I think, if you don't put lids back on shit it's saying to me that when you use something you don't care about your stuff or other peoples stuff. People who don't put on lids are the same people who leave CD/DVD's out of cases. Just chuck them around. I own DVD's and CD's. I hate paying $30 bucks for  either, but I do. Because it makes me respect it. I've lent a CD to my brother and the case came back broken and the CD itself was scratched to the shit house and has sauce on it. It was then that I hated people using my shit. And it's very anal of me. And I sometimes which I was more relaxed about my shit. Lids off food I'm going to eat is in the same category as the CD/DVD's. I'm anal. Deal with it. Lol.

Anyhoos after giving Okey shit we had everything cooked and enjoyed an awesome meal. 7-8pm Okey and Bass left. It was a sad moment because we'd miss Okey. And... Okeys car. Lol. Then Creek Mat and myself walked back to the cabin and got stuck into our Jim Beam's and Imported Beer. The night was full of conversation.

The next morning we all woke up. I was slightly hung over. But we got up, cleaned up and had breakfast. Had a shower and headed into Halls Gap for essentials. And Ice Cream. Came back and looked toward the surrounding mountains.
""Let's go there.""
And so we got some warmer clothes and cameras and headed to the ""Goal"". Our Goal was a Cliff/Rock (photo down bottom) which over looked the Caravan Park. There was lots of cliff climbing. I went on ahead and took some good shots of the boys climbing up. We headed then into bush at the top of the cliffs. Up and up we went until we made our goal. It was awesome! The view was good. The company great. It was then that it started to get drizzly. So we headed back down. Crossed a creek and had to walk through some paddock because we ended up the other side of the Caravan Park. Saw some roos. And just as we entered the Park it came down raining. It was awesome.

Heading back to Number 11 after a chat with the owners we go started on tea. It was about 5-6pm. Then the card games started. And the Tequila. Creek had an awesome idea to start chucking food around. Bread, then tomatoes, then flour. I got Creek a beauty with the Butter. Lol. And after collapsing and laughing, we looked around and what we saw was a wrecked cabin. It was funny. Let the CLEANING COMMENCE! And so drunkly at 1ish in the morning we cleaned the cabin. Our beds. Everything. Then after it was smick! we had a shower and to bed. We had to be gone by 10am otherwise we'd get charged a late check out fee. I went to bed and it was ""sticky"". Lol. But I slept ok.

The next morning the cabin looked great. We left a surprize for someone in the future. And we were out by 10:15am. We headed into Halls Gap one last time. And the on to some look outs. It was nice. Visited MacKenzie Falls. Some lake and it was home time.

I got back home at 9pm Sunday night. I'm still recovering. My break was supposed to be relaxing. It was in a sence, but I'm still tired. It was worth it.

So Creek to you, have fun in England buddy. Here's some pictures. And a movie.

Bewarned that there is 90 pictures and they are 4MB in total size.

"event","So I promised an update. Here it is. Night!

I kid... There is more to tell. Last night I went to a party. It was Crazy Bests birthday. Crazy, awesome bass player, fun guy and he looks like Bon Jovi. The night started at his place, me drinking some Pre-Mixed Cougars with the occasional random drink thrown in for good measure. Lots to talk about. I pretty much knew no-one there. It was good fun.

Anyhoos after lots of drinks we decided to go out clubbing. So Jacquelin, Sarah, Veg, Emma and I climbed into Veg's car while Crazy, Evan and Emmitt caught a taxi. Emma is going out with Crazy. It was an interesting car trip over because Emma was really smashed and talking about how ""shit"" she is. How she doesn't deserve Crazy and that he's going to pick up ""hot"" chicks. It was pretty awkard because I was in the back in the middle of Jacquelin and Emma, and Emma is all complaining and we're trying to cheer her up. Totally killed the mood. It's rare that I feel pity people, but I felt sorry for Emma's mindset. She was saying she was ""ugly"" and ""fat"", yet she's a very attractive woman. I know I'm attractive in my own silly way, and I felt pity because Emma was putting too much thought into what other people think. The way she spoke everything depended on Crazy loving her. It makes me sad. Because who give a fuck what other people think about you. If you're unhappy with yourself then make a change. Fuck.

Anyhoos. We drove into Melbourne City and went to this one club that was pretty cool. They had a live band upstairs which was all chinese. The lead singer kept showing her teeth. Yes, it freaked me out. I'm still having nightmares. Lol! Actually as a side note, while I was asleep in my car last night I was dreaming that I was some futuristic ninja. Details (maybe) later. Anyways at that bar/club I was having a good chat to Jacquelin. She's 22 and into traveling. Been to quite a few places actually. With Sarah. I'm jealous. They say envy is a sin. I don't really know who ""they"" are... but if that's the case, I'm a sinner <em>baby</em>! Fuck it. So anyways, we scored these awesome couches and Crazy is removing Emmas top. It was a good show. Veg told them to get a room, and so they disappeared for the rest of the night. They made it back to Crazys alright, but we didn't see from them the rest of the night. Evan was chatting everyone up. Emmitt was popping in and out of our little group.

The whole reason we went out was because Sarah wanted to party. Though she was just sitting around with Veg, Jacquelin and I. Probably disheartened by the whole Emma thing. So I told her. So then she vanished as well. We found her picking up some dude. Good fun. Then Veg decides that we should go to another place. So we begin this expedition to find Evan and Emmitt. Long story short, we found them. We we're upstairs, so Veg leads us to the Band Green Room and we sort of make our way through a couple of bands and then down the ""second secret special"" exit. It brought us to the front door which was cool. We took a right then walked about 10 steps to another bar. Ah the convenience of the city. This bar had a live band playing some great Aussie classics. So I had a bit of a dance session with Sarah and Jacquelin. Then after the band got off stage and the DJ wacked on some tunes, I had some chick in a green and black striped shirt with her tits all out rubbing up me to that ""Flaunt It"" song. It was ok. I was more focused on Sarah and Jacquelin so I might have seemed a bit cold.

Then after all that we jumped into Veg's car and drove around Melbourne and St. Kilda yelling out shit about gerbils. Well Sarah, Evan and Emmitt has this thing with perverted things you can do to gerbils. So they got me all wound up and I was pretty much the only one really yelling out gerbil related shit to random people on the street and in cars. I got some laughs. Don't if it was ""at"" or ""with"" me. But a laughs a laugh.

So we get back to Crazys apartments and Veg lets Evan, Emmitt and I out. Sarah and Jacquelin were staying at a backpackers place and Veg probably went home. So just after they left I had a good spew at the bottom of Crazys steps. And by good I mean <em>goood</em>. I woke up the next morning with Evan hitting my windows and watching Crazy and the gang drive off in Emmas car. Also the pigeons were feasting on my 4 hour old regurgitation. Nice! The circle of life; Spew, Sleep, Eat ""chicken"", Drink, Spew. If I didn't Spew then the pigeons wouldn't be fed which means the Colonel wouldn't have cheap ingredients to make my Popcorn-""Chicken"" which would mean my $6.95 reg box of Pop would cost $11.87 thus I would have less moneys to buy alchol. Which then means I couldn't afford to go out. Which then means no more KFC. As I sit here typing this I'm thinking of all the vegetarians who are upon reading this thinking ""YES!"" Look, Veggos, KFC isn't real meat. ;)

I was going to post a video about my awesome guitar playing skillz... but they're non existant. So instead meet ""Darren"" a character I'm working on. Or... was.

"event","Just a quicky.

I've had my laptop for over a year now. Maybe longer. And just then, as in <i>right now</i> I've discovered something about my laptop that could change the world!

Where I thought no USB exisited indeed one does!!! I have two USB ports at the rear of my laptop, one for my iPod and the other for my old phone. I also have one on the right which my mouse plugs in to. And now I have discovered one on the left of my laptop. Just now. I never knew it even existed! I was unplugging my iPod or something to plug in my camera. Ha! My camera is the whole reason why I found this ""virgin"" USB. Because I couldn't be stuffed loading the software for my camera I used to just pull out the Card and plug it into my All-In-1 card reader. But recently my Card Reader has been playing up. So just right then I've pushed in my Card and nothings happened. So I figure staring at it would somehow fix it, thus my faith in my own staring ability. So I pull out my Card and then lean to one side looking at it as I push it in. There is, to the top left of my reader, a little green L.E.D. So I'm watching this to see if there is any responce. While I'm watching my eyes start to wander after nothing happens, and suddenly I'm staring at a USB port. This magical port with the little USB symbol under it.

After a silent contemplation of this newly found wonder I also dismiss the whole idea. ""How could I find another USB port now?"" So to prove it to myself I had to plug something in to this... ""virgin"" port. So I unplugged my phone data lead and then pushed it into this new port. It went it tighter than my more used slots, but it gave me great satisfaction when it clunked into place. I then freaked out and had to tell someone about it. Hence I'm here. Fucken awesome.

And yes... to answer your question, this was the highlight of my day. ;)"

"event","I always enjoy coming up with random titles for these things. I don't know why. Just makes me feel good inside.

I believe in one thing. Choice. Stemming from that is responciblity. We make choices and we are responcible for them. We choose to lie, steal, eat that chocolate bar, pick our nose, laugh at those less off than ourselves. We choose to believe we are better than others and we choose to think we are worse.

Everybody has an opinion and everybody has a choice on how to react to opinions expressed by others. We can rant and rave and get blue in the face, trying to prove an opinion wrong, but opinions are neither right nor wrong. They are simply ideas. And who gives a fuck if someone thinks that walking around in nothing but socks is indecent? In a shopping centre.

Opinion noted. Walking around ""almost"" starkers makes you uncomfortable. I'm sorry. Walking around ""almost"" naked makes me feel alive. But... not really a good idea in winter. One word. Shrinkage. Not gonna pick up the ladies then. Well... I do have a hard time even in the summer. And most of the year. All of it. *sigh*

So in keeping with the short and sweet... I don't care if you call me lazy. My responce is I'm sleep deprived. Does your bum look big in that? In my opinion yes. But large ladies have bigger boobs. And boobs are the best.

O_O

I say this too much, but, do whatever makes you happy people. Its your choice. But be aware that robbing a bank has consequences which your responcible of.

I'm going to bed. Well... I'm alreading <i>in</i> bed... the joys of a laptop. Keeping my lap warm and my sperm count low.

I'm feeling alright too. Dad's doing ok at the hospital. He's still sedated, which means I'll have to wait a little longer to tell him that it's 2007 and make him think all this stuff has happened which hasn't. Am I cruel? Nah. I just want him to laugh and come home. I miss him. It's moments like these you realise that certian people in your life do alot more for you than you know. It's only now that he's in hospital and sedated that all this shit has been piling up which we need him to fix and sort out. That was his job. He was also the mental stabiliser. These thing will be here for when he comes back. In the meantime I have to be the one to get shit down around here. It's hard. But he taught me well. Paying bills, cleaning the spa, cooking tea.

Anyhoos. Just letting everyone who cares (and those who don't) that my old man is doing ok. But it'll be a couple of months before he's home.

"event","I've got alot on my plate at the moment. So I'm not really in the mood to write a huge post about all things happening in my life... because right now I'm just not in the right frame of mind.

What I will say is that I'm not really happy at the moment because my Dad is in hospital. He got a bout of pneumonia and so was admitted to the Anglis Hospital. He was going alright there too. So it wasn't a big issue. But then the other day his lungs stopped working by themselves. So they had to put him under and move him to another hospital. So now he's out cold with a breathing machine down his throat, a tube down his nose removing all the shit from his lungs and a heart monitor. See my Dad suffers from sleep apnea and he's over weight. He used to smoke but quit 5 years ago. He has an irregular heart beat and has diabetes. So all these things have sort of mashed together to make a shit situation. And they still don't know what caused the pneumonia. So the main focus is getting him stable enough to work out whats wrong with him and then treat it.

So I'm waiting, with the rest of the family, for my Dad to get over this first stage. He's a fighter though. He woke up out of the sedation so that was a bit scary.

So yeah. After this we're going on a holiday. We need it.

I just hope he gets better."

Well actually I had known him since high school. He was apart of a group of people who I didn't get along with. Caleb Agg. It's amazing how people change. It has been only 4 or so years since I left. It felt weird seeing him again. But he's actually a nice bloke. It was weird too having him in my room. Checking out my shit. I felt open to the world. I mean here I was, with a guy I didn't get along with but also never really knew, and we were talking and he's checking out my shit.

My attuide in highschool compared to now isn't really different. I always had the mentality that alot of people are very similar in their desires and thoughts. That enabled me to hang with the various groups in High School. The cool kids, the sporty kids, the nerdy kids... everyone. I knew then as I know now that everyone has a life outside of school. And everyone has friends. Even though they're in different circles they have qualitys which people of similar nature tend to recognize and attach themselves to.

As much as people try and pretend, we are all the same. We're not <i>exactly</i> the same, but we're all human. We are socialists. We form groups. And in these groups we form hierarchies. We all have a role to play. And there is always someone bigger and better than us. I'm not exempt. I sometimes need a leader to give me direction. Sometimes too I am the leader, sending someone stupid enough to listen to me to their fall. ;)

Back to Caleb. He is just one dude. Just a guy whose dating my sister. The past shapes us. But high school was petty. I find myself hanging on to the memorys from high school. But it doesn't control me. It's a comparison to the now and how things were different. Easier back then. Some people hold on to the past so much that they can't move on and see how others have changed. I've had a few run-ins with people from my past. Somewere good and others were bad. Bad because they could only remember me as who I <i>was</i> and not who I <i>am</i>. And so without even trying they either snobbed me or harrased me. Eh. Caleb was different. And it was good we could chat. It make me happy that at least some people can give second chances. To start afresh. If you keep your past shut up and locked without exploring some of it with new knowleadge from your present, then you're limiting yourself of possible friendships and experiences. That's the way I see it.

I can't wait for, and hope, that I have a 10 year highschool reunion. I'm interested in where the people I've spent a good 6 years of my life with are now in thier lives.

And hey... there might be some hotties from high school still single eh? ;)"

"event","Man I'm so tired. It's been really bad the last couple of days. I don't know what it is either. The other night I had 10 hours sleep and the next day I felt really shit. Last night I had about seven to eight hours sleep and I'm tired again. I wish I had answers to this puzzle.

My day starts pretty much at 6am. I ride to work, which takes me 20 minutes. I usually finish up around 5pm and then I ride home. And I piss fart around until bed time. I make room for tea somewhere in there. But it's usually bum around, dinner, shower, bed. At the moment I'm reading Michael McGirr's Bypass: The Story of a Road. It's a non-fiction and it's an interesting story of a man riding the Hume Highway. I get a chapter or so in before the tiredness takes control. It's a pain in the arse because I used to finish a book in one sitting. Though I suppose that life changes. I'm not at school anymore. I actually have to work. And hard at that.

Anyways, I have recieved my Telecommunication and Data Cabling Licence. It's not my electrician's licence but it does enable me to do telephone wiring and security systems. Which means I now can start up my own business and then work even more longer hours. But now on weekends ;)

As for what I want to do in life I'm still undecided. I have chosen this profession because it does interest me and it provides a fallback job incase the adventures I want to take run foul. I still want to be an actor. I still want to be a drifter. I'm not interested in ""settling"" down. Though it would be nice to be in good company during my travels.

This weekend is going to be an interesting one. It's my step-mum Barb's 50th birthday party. I get to be barman. I love drinking. I'm not an angry drunk or anything like that. I don't go skitz. I say alot of stupid things. I also get really tired. But thats just me recently. Tired.

It is something that is starting to worry me though. I don't know weither or not to go on medication or something of that sort. I'm sick of sleeping between seven and 10 hours every night and still being tired. And it's not a little yawn or anything like that. It's a ""if I sit down for two minutes I'll fall asleep"" type tired. If I'm not working with my hands and forcing myself to stay awake I'll end up passing out. Sitting down for lunch and smoke-o is done very carefully. I have to make sure I'm uncomfortable or I'll won't get up. I wish I knew what was causing it.

Also you know when you're tired and you're force to remain awake and you start getting restless and gibbering. I've got it worked down to the fact that the body needs to remain awake but is so tired that any laps in thought would send me to sleep. So I have to keep myself mentally stimulated. Which, in my case, is basically speaking what I'm thinking and to laugh at random. And alot of it's stupid.

Also, as the guys at work have suggested, it may be sexual frustration. I was talking to my Nephews Mum Jenny and she was complaining about not having any sex for about six months. So of course I was thinking about my last time. And I scared myself with when I actually had. I'm 20 years old. I turned 20 in late March. It's now June. That last time I had sex was early February <i>before I turned eighteen</i>! I got into a huge conversation with Jenny about sex and sexuality. For along time when Jenny and my brother were engaged she had thought I was homosexual. In fact her whole family did. And my brother had doubts. But that fact of the matter is I haven't put myself out there. Sex isn't the answer. But it's good. From what I remember ;)

After breaking up with Karina I've just been focusing on work. I haven't <strike>been able to</strike> got up off my arse and gone out anywhere. Alot of it's due to fear. I don't really have anyone to hang out with. And that brings up issues in itself. Hopefully my good friend Mat is moving up to good ol' Melbourne and we'd be able to hang out and experience life. The offshoot of that is that I'm really looking forward to this moment. That remains the sole purpose of moving out. But I've found it hits a chord at home with Dad and Barb. And I'm finding myself saying alot that ""I'm glad I'll be moving out soon, because your shit..."" blah blah. It hurts my Dad when I say it. And upon reflection it hurts me because I don't know where this arseholeishness is coming from. Well actually I think I do. I'm fucken tired.

Goodnight peoples."

"event","Ok so I've been thinking. Yes, it happens! Don't start the whole ""blame"" game with me. I'm sorry! Ok... so I lied. It's what people do.

Does that sound familiar? Well it shouldn't. Unless of course you've tapped into my brain somehow... hmmmm. If you're thinking I'm on drugs at the moment... you'd be wrong! But it'd be nice. I do know, however, that for the last three minutes I've had my headphones on without actually using them. So time for some music! Ok, I've put on some ELO. But that may change by the time I finish this LJ. Whatever song I finish up on will be placed into that funny little ""MUSIC"" box down the bottom there. Hello! *giggle*

I'm not on drugs! SHHH!

Now for the reason. Because everything needs a reason. A ""something happened because"" type thing. And heres mine. I've felt it necessary to point out why I'm here and how I feel life should be more than what I've been doing with it so far. Well thats the jist. Might not be completely told in full. Or coherantly. But thats just me.

So heres the smart quote of the day. From the pen of Douglas Adams, and alot of lazy people. ""Stuff Happens."" Indeed it does. Read Mostly Harmless, the fifth book in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy trilogy. Shooch! I know there can't be <i>five</i> in a trilogy. But its how it's marketed. How can I not use that. Anyhoos, getting off topic.

Stuff happens. And once its done its done. And as much as we hate it, the past isn't going to change. The consequences remain. Its how we take shit happening that writes the ""Now"". The future isn't written yet. And the ""Now"" is the pen (or pencil, whichever you prefer.) The paper shall be... the... Universe! Space! ""Now"" is the tool we use to carve into the world. The recent past was that last sentence you wrote. Your childhood was a couple of chapters back. And we keep writing until we die. Our book then becomes part of the library which is history and existance. But its usually the one hidden on the top shelf somewhere toward the back, in that part of the library which people aren't botherd to pay a visit. The Non-Fiction section. It's pretty boring. Well for everyone else, not you. The <i>writer</i>. You think you're book is the next Da Vinci Code. Bound to become a movie (MAN! BAADD pun! Lol). But to the rest of us its more of the same. You think your Dan Brown but really you're Dr. Suess. You write a bunch of crap that entertains children. Except Dr. Suess is better than you. And you can't ryhme as well. Your ryhming is as good as my spelling.

So whats the issue? Why rant and rave about this? Well... I'm not raving. Though the song I'm listening to suggests otherwise. DJ Issac - Thriller. I have no idea where I got this from. It's one of the 1628 songs in my iTunes library. I have more music on my hard drive as well which isn't logged there. Again... OF TOPIC!

The issue is perspective. Lets take one life. Mine. I am born. March 21st 1986. It was a Tuesday. I live my life. I die. My body, my vessel which I used to live my life, decays if I'm buried whole. And then during/after that the atoms used to create my body break away from it and become part of the Earth. Which then becomes part of the air and vegetation which then gets digested by an animal who dies and the cycle continues. My atoms aren't special. Infact they're recycled. What makes ""Me"" is who I am and how I interact with this existance. Thats why I referred to my body as just that. My body. It isn't ""Me"". Well not entirely. It does help mold who I am. If my body came with no nose then I'd have no experience of smell and I'd be different. I would have had experiences which shape who I am with this ""functioning"" body. Farts would be funny. But only if I heard them. Lol.

So I'm born and I die. Check. Now inbetween is filled with these things called experience which shapes my conscience. Fuck. I spelt that correctly. Con-Science. Maybe actually have a Con-Science we are actually doing that. Conning Science. Our existance of thought might be an actual soul which is against everything Science believes in. Ha, like it actually believes in <i>anything</i>. Darwin probably didn't even exist. Sciences Santa... or Jesus if you like. Darwin. Yeah... I wonder the reason behind the platypus. Maybe they evolved from Ducks. NO! Maybe a duck got the honky tonk on with a beaver's beaver (lol). You know? To better the species.

WHAT THE HELL AM I SAYING?! I agree with science. I acknowledge my death as being just that. An end of life. I don't accept it. But I'm content, enough, to acknowledge. Back on TOPIC!

The issue I have is peoples... depression. Ok... <i>MY</i> depression. I'm not actually depressed. I'm sad by what happens. But I understand somethings. Which is why I'm here writing. To, try and, explain. The past has happened. Get over it. It upsets me how people dig themselves a hole to crawl into. If you're so eager to ignore life then kill yourself. The alternative is to live. I have an issue with myself for being unhappy about having to work. Work is actually fun now. But it's annoying that it eats up time. Instead of wasting time focusing on how I'm wasting time I should be enjoying every minute I have. And accept that work is apart of learning and growing. It also makes living a bit better. If I don't enjoy what I do then I should find something else. But on that note, just because I have a bad day I shouldn't quit and find something better. Bad days are apart of life. Without bad we wouldn't have good. We need the bad days. I have to keep remembering to think like Dogbert. Life is the show. I'm the director. And everyone else are the actors. I, as the director, make the show to my liking. The best part about this show is that I'm the writer as well. Though actors being actors, they can make my job hard. But fun. Improv is fun!

The past is gone and we can't change it. Deal with it. I have issues with people. But whats happened in the past shouldn't dictate what I do in the now. It should be a footnote. But just like I have the ability to change, so do others. Second chances are very rare, but important. I think everyone should be able to have second chances. But if they come across as ""I'm never going to change!"" then a second chance is wasted. You can't dictate how you give second chances by what people have done in the past. They might have changed. It's their attuide in the now upon which second chances should be given. And its hard. A great motto is ""How would you like it if someone did it to you?"" You can live a good life living by that motto. How do I know this at 20? Well... I don't. But think about it. And not just about bad things. How would I like it if I got a kiss? Maybe I should give more kisses.

I respect people. Because I want to be respected. And I suppose thats how come I'm where I am now. At the same time I think I'm too up tight. I'm loose enough. But theres always room for more ""looseness"". Lol.

I want to make a good story. I want my life to be awesome. And it has been. But thats in the past. I'm going to have a laugh more often. And I'm going to remember that no matter who you are you're going to end up the same as me. It doesn't give me a licence to go crazy. Because my actions have reactions and those reactions may affect the people I care about. So I'm using my knowledge with caution. I open my heart to the world. I am who I am. And if people can't accept that then I can't change how they feel. Not if I want to keep my sence of self. Its this view of people and myself that has me accepting of people. I have time for everyone. But if you fuck me around then your time won't be as important as someone elses.

Enjoy. Experience. Be yourself. Go with whats right. Whats right is what you'd do for yourself.

"event","And so I begin to write another post about my life. Well maybe even about myself.

Actually cut the bs... I have a question! Well... more a statement with a question bit in it. Thingy. The statement is this: I'm thinking about posting a naked photo of myself on LJ! The question is: How many people would actually view it?

This is the thoughts that come when thinking in the shower. Very interesting. Now instead of just ""going ahead"" and doing it I've sort of planted the seed. I might leave it go for a couple of weeks. I might not actually do it. No one knows. <i>I</i> don't even know. Thats when it becomes implusive again. I <i>believe</i> it's going to happen, I just don't know when. My thought process on this matter is mainly about testing my readers and the internet. It's simple. I tell you I <i>may</i> be posing nude sometime in the future. If I gave exact dates then people would be counting down... ya know how it is. Then when (if) I post it I place it behind a cut. That way if you don't want to see it then you won't be subjected to it. And your eyes are saved. The advantage I have here is that I store my pictures I post here on my own server. My server is right now sitting about 20cm to the left of my foot. This gives me information. Information is handy. Now if I post my picture on the internet then <i>anybody</i> could just steal it. Thats a risk. But I've opened my mind to the world here so whats a bit of flesh? So while someone can ""steal"" it... I have control while its viewed here. And thats my experiment.

Getting back to the ""server"" advantage... the software that's used to make the data on my server available to the WWW... I'm <i>so</i> giving away inside information here! But here it is. By using my server any data that is retrieved from my server is logged. So while the data remains there, anyone who accesses it has to connect to my server and thus gives me their IP. Now this isn't as bad as it seems. Because otherwise all hell would break loose. I can't actually (easily) place names on IP. Unless you give my your IP and actually tell me who you are I won't know its you. But the number of IP's that have ""contacted"" my server I'll know. Also using some inside information I'll be able to find out which service provider each IP is using. So I'll be able to pretty much guess who you are. NEW PARAGRAPH!

Now with all of this I'll also be enabling commenting. The issue with LJ is, is that when you click the ""comment"" link you go to a section of LJ which <i>kinda</i> holds my whole entry. So anything behind the cut is shown when you comment. So if you comment you will see what's behind the LJ cut. I'll be sure to mention this again when I post. So if you comment I'll know who has actually seen it as well. Feel free to critize. Or something?

So why am I doing this? Well I'm hoping just from this post that people may question why I'd want to put a nude photo of myself on the web. I don't actually know why. It just seems like a good idea. I hope people have ideas. It will be tasteful though. Well... if you call a naked dude tasteful. Also I want to know if people can actually resist. Think about it. I'll be naked! And the reader will be at home, possibly alone... will utter ""social"" determination quench the <i>need</i> to see me naked? Or will the curiousity just be so over whelming that you'd have to pop a squiz? And I'll know. If someone steals it and then posts it everywhere and you actually see it then well some of my experiment is destroyed. But... well actually not really. Because viewing that way is not by choice... but the records I'll have of the access on my own server will tell me who <i>wanted</i> to see it. If I dig around. And if you comment then great... we will have shared something! Lol.

Just think about it... who can resist? I'm not saying I'm special or anything... I'm by no means great looking. Or even good. Lol. But someone is showing themselves to the world! And it is the world. Its the internet. Its the mofoing world.

Man I'm getting so worked up. I'm even curious. And even if you say log onto the librarys computer downtown or something and I never actually know who you are or if you did (from my friends list), you'll know. You'll know you saw! And that another number was added to my log. And I'll know someone viewed it. I'll know. And its scareingly good. OOOOOooooooOOOooOOooOOO!

It's not really a big deal if you want to sneek a peek. See if you measure up. Lol. But I've made it out to be. Even if I'm the only one.

Anyways... its almost 12am on a Thursday morning. And I'm fucked and have trenches to dig tomorrow. Or today? GOOD MORROW! In about 17 minutes. So goodnight people. I hope I've given you something to look forward to.

Truth be told... I might be a little flabby, but this picture will not only serve as an experiment but also a booster. It'll make/remind me to actually start up at the gym and get a bit of musle deff. Sort of a before shot. And then 6 months down the track I may show off a much sexier Justin. And people will be able to see that everyone can get into shape. If you can be fucked."

"event","Man I haven't even been on my computer for at least 4 days now. For the last 3 nights I've been coming home and going straight to bed due to the fact I have a massive cold. I'm so annoyed right now. I have a blocked nose, my eardrums are closing up, I have a massive headache and my throat is so sore. What annoys me the most is that tomorrow I have a housewarming party I'm invited to tomorrow night. It's annoying because afterwards we are all going to Espy Hotel to see some live music and its a chance to meet some women who have the same interests as I do. Heck it's a chance to meet some women. And how am I supposed to ""get on the scene"" with a fucken head cold? I'm too nice to just say ""fuck it"" and kiss some stranger and give them a cold. I don't want to give anybody a cold. And thats why this cold shits me.

So bad. I've been on so many drugs and remedys. I've been having 14 hour sleeping stints. Taking it kinda easy at work. And I don't feel any better... in fact I'm probably worse. Why now? Why <i>this</i> week? I was so looking forward to meeting some women. Yes, thats my only concern. ;) I was hoping to have a one night stand. To get lucky. I'm jealous of womans ability to be able to have sex whenever they want. Oh sure some of you women will denie it. But if you wern't so picky and had the urge then I bet there'd be any number of men willing. And thats the difference between men and women. If one woman went up to a 100 men and offered herself then 100 men would say yes. Reverse the situation and probably about 10, even less women would oblige. And I don't know if I should feel dirty being a man... or enlightened. Alot of people find sex a tooboo thing. A big naughty. I find it beautiful and fun. An activity I feel both partys should enjoy. And I try my best. But I'm so on a dry spell.

It gets back to work... and talking to the guys. One guys married... the others almost a porn star... heh. He has crazy storys. Like he had his hair cut for the great shave and the woman who cut his hair and him got talking. He ended up at her place with some other people. She was married. And her husband turns to him and asked if he wants to participate in a threesome with him and his wife. Well anyways he come to work with this crazy story even he had trouble believing. And I'm not really wanting that. Hell no. But I'm not even in any leage.

Eh... aside from my frustrations... this cold is pretty crap. I wish I was better. You know how when you get a cold and you just wish you could be normal again? Wishing you had your own healthy throat back instead of this stupid itchy one. But then when you gain your normallity back you take it for granted. Like with my ears how there getting blocked... yet I don't wear earmuffs when I'm hammerdrilling. I don't look after myself enough. Well I do... lets be honest. I try and eat the right things and I do plenty of exercise at work. I just want to live life. And having a cold brings out the worst in me. Because my senses are all fucked. I go to work and come home and go straight to bed so I am rested enough to crawl out of bed the next morning. And in my dreams and thoughts while lying in bed I've been thinking that if I add a couple of hours of computer to the equation then I'm not really differing from what I normally do anyways. So maybe this cold is a blessing. But why now on the week-eve of an awesome party? Maybe to teach me the values of partys and friends and family. Well even though I'm not going to get any sex... not that I would anyways... I'm still gonna rock up and say G'Day to Crazy and apoligize in person about not being able to stay for long. Hey I might even get really drunk anyway and it might blow away my cold. Heres hoping. I just hope I don't pass it on to anyone. Stupid immune system.

Catch peoples. Have a sexellent time!

Man I seem to have this weird twitch happening to my right eye and the right part of my lip. And my eyes look really sunken. Man I'm stuffed. But another day tomorrow. Of work of course.

I had the weirdest feeling today. I was just clipping some cables and then I felt really good. Loved even. And then I sort of remembered I'm single... so that feeling went away. And then I felt worse. I hate it when that happens. I miss having someone to cuddle.

Man I really have to have a shave and clean myself up. But it's really hard to try and find someone when you work 6 days a week and then you spend the 7th doing the whole God thing... resting. I bitch about having meaning in life and I deny myself any form of meaning. Or is it simply that I don't realise the meaning my life has? I focus too much on wondering how my life is special and not enough on actually making it special. And I get given chances glore... I just couldn't be stuffed.

I'm sort of losing who I am. Well... I was. See I'm becoming myself again. The guys at work are manly men... and I have to keep that part of myself to keep my head above the water. I still act like myself though. So I get the weird looks. I just have to take a step back... but not too much of a step that I remove myself from my life.

I'm disappointed in myself for how my relationship ended up with Karina. I miss it. But I'm so angry at myself that I didn't make it work. Instead when things get tough I quit. I really wanted a bitch slap though. Something to wake me up. But we wern't right for each other. We wanted different things. Though sometimes the same. Probably. See thats one thing. I just never knew what she wanted because there was no communication. Thats all I need. I need a woman who speaks her mind. Thats all I want. Ah well. Things happen. And once again after pushing the people I love away I'm alone. Lol.

So I'm going to make the most of it. I've got nothing to lose. Chickens!

Yeah... thats what happens when you don't line up the lights when you cut them out. You have to patch the roof, and because its in a hall you have to repaint the whole roof. Otherwise you get paint marks and it looks unprofessional. And I am in a professional business. So yeah. DAMM!!

As for the title reference... I bought some stuff.

I got meself PC Powerplay Mag... still haven't got the subcription. Don't worry fellas, your present has been deposited into my Bendigo Bank account. I just have to wait 3 weeks before I get my Visa Debut Card.

I bought myself a Zippo Lighter... because I've always wanted one. And they rock! I bought a chrome one and I'm hoping to get the ""Teabag"" and Sentorien inscripted on it. Awesomeness!!!

I also bought the entire series of Dilbert. Dilbert rocks. I have a Dilbert calender and when I saw the whole series boxset on special I had to get it. So I did. I'm a shopping whore!

And I bought some new iPod headphones. $60 but their worth it. Man the put alot into their packaging. They came in an airtight foil ""bag"" along with airtight foil bagged remote and two condom-type-wrapped sets of those black cover things which go over the earbud. Mega'la Packaging. DAMM! But I have them in my ears now listening to some AC/DC.

""she was a fast machine. She kept her motor clean...""

Anyways... catch peeps. If you don't hear from me for a while it's because I'll be watching Dilbert and/or eating. Also might be working and shit. I have to write a proper one shortly. And by shortly I mean in a few days.

After reading Mat's post about being all cool bananas now his shits out of the way... It's sort of lifted up my mood. I <i>hate</i> that! All cracking to write about something and then POW! deflated by peoples... ""happiness"". Lol. But good on him. I'm just sad about yesterday. I had work and then I had my cousins 50th birthday... so that ment I couldn't go hang with Okey and his missus and possibly Mat. It was planned for this Saturday... but I thought he ment next Saturday. Ah well... once again Okey's mystery girlfriend... who I've sorta met twice now!... is still a mystery. Lol.

Petrol... once again she has risin'. And for fuck sakes. See now its $1.30/litre. Thats the ""minimum"". Just think... one fucken year ago I was paying 90cents... 90 CENTS! A litre... not to fill up my car... lol. BUT NINETY FREAKING CENTS PER FREAKING LITRE! Up 40cents... which means because my tank holds 65 litres... I pay an extra 26 bucks per fill up. TWENTY SIX!!! FUCKEN BUCKS! Which is roughly every week... so... carry the pi... thats about a grand... ONE THOUSAND DORRAS!!! every year. And thats at the moment. What if it goes up... *gasp*. What if it climbs to... $1.50/litre! The almight lord forbid! Fuck its almost hit $1.40. You know... fuck. Like I have to rant and rave about this. I have to. See the goverment took off some tax last year which was about 4cents/litre. For a while there petrol was four cents cheaper. But see that was a year ago. Now its forty cents (deer dear...?) more expencive. We have a tax on alot of things here in Australia call the GST. Great tax. Good shit. (being sarcastic) 10% tax on the shit we buy. Petrol has gone up 40 cents... 10% of which is 4 cents. Last year the goverment removed a four cent tax... oh... but wait! They've got it back now! Don't they! Yes they do. Yes they do boo boo... schnookems! Yibbity Yibbita folks! The Goverment never loses. FUCKEN SHIT DICKS! But fuel is the basis on all economy. Yeah... see because fuel drives the trucks which transports the goods which makes our products we buy. Yeah! And if fuel goes up then the shipping costs go up. The Victorian Police force already pay an extra 2 Million/year to ""fuel"" their fleet. We pay for that! But see if shipping costs go up... then of course that fat guy who runs Safeway won't want to cop that cost. No... he'll pass it on to the customer... us. So now food costs more. Oh poor baby. See even people who don't drive fucken cars are getting ripped by fuel prices! Because... think about it. People are like... ""I'll fucken ride my bike to work... or walk!"" But how the fuck does the fucken bikes get to the bike shops? People just riding them round? NO! They get transported by fucken trucks that run on fucken fuel! Fucken! Lol. So shit like that goes up in price.

(<i>NOTE: I'm swearing alot due to frustration at this given situation... sorry fucken!</i>)

I pay an extra Grand to keep my car running every week and I do shit fuck all driving. Shit fuck all. When I'm working 7 days a week anyways. Its fucken more if I wanna catch up with my peeps. So now imagine businesses that supply a service. Like Plumbers or Electricians... They have fleets out... 3 work vans say... which do a fuck load of driving per week because they work from their vans. We fill up 3 times a week at work. THREE! We have 2 work vans. Both about 50 litres. Make it easy math. (This is for you Vanessa) So thats $3.9/litre/week/van. $7.8/litre/week for the boss man. $780/week. Ermmm... 40 Thousand per year! Spent on fuel for 2 vans on the road. I don't even earn that much! And I have one fucken car which has about 15 more litres in it. Not that I fill up as much... but even then... $20,000 dollars/van/year. THATS MEGA FUCKED UP! Thats on fuel. So you think that cost might be handed down to the customer? I would imagine so. So even if you don't have a car... even if you don't <i>NEED</i> fuel... it affects you. No ones safe. And those that do actually have a car are fucked. I have a car. I'm fucked. Well... I'm not really ""fucked"". Haven't been for fucken ages! But thats a different story! Lol.

Look working it out I spend (if fuel costs stay at $1.30) $4400 dollars every year on fuel. If petrol was below a dollar... say 95 cents... I'd spend $3200 dollars on fuel. a huge fucken saving of 1 grand! Or how about back in the 1970's when fuel was <a href=""http://www.ts.co.nz/~nicksmp/pressrel/2000/09-24.html"">8 cents a litre</a> I would have been paying $270 bucks a year. Would have been saving $4000 bucks then.

Ah its fucked. And its the cause for Wars and the way everyones economy is fucked. Our whole socitey rides on Petrol and Sex... and I can't afford either."

Its true. Well... ok, it's not. I've come to realise that things are pretty bad in the world at the moment. I mean yeah, it's fucked up. Stupid wars over oil. Stupid oil prices rising. Stupid oil burning away causing the stupid atmosphere to get cancer. Stupid tasty beverages such as cola and beer rotting my teeth and liver. Stupid liver. Stupid everything.

I got into a serious argument with a guy from work. I was just having a lend and it essclated out of control. It went from being a quiet discussion about something work related to about how I just have to argue the ""point"". Talk people down. You know, the whole ""Me so perfect, you Jane"" thing. After this dude just saying a few things, in utter seriousness, I was speechless. He put me in my place. And we continued onward to the next job. (The discussion was held in the van between jobs.)

Most of that afternoon was filled with akward silence. Usually I would crap on about stupid shit. The need I have to talk usually keeps me sane while, at the same time, driving those around me crazy. But I was silent. I know I'm an arse. But this whole time I believed I had some sort of arseholish charm. That I was smart and quick and people were in awe because of it. Finding out I was wrong was a huge step for me. And I liked it. I'm trying to learn from it. I need to keep my mouth shut. Or say things with a bit more thought, instead of mindless rambling. Slowly toward the end of the day we both got over being annoyed and conservation started, slowly. I just really want to learn from this. I'm an arguementitive person who trys to knock everyone down. I used to try and make everyone play on a level ground, cutting down those who thought too much of themselves. I was happy enough to get knocked a few rungs down myself. But it isn't like that anymore. Or wasn't. I was pushing myself up too much, and it lead to milk crated being kicked out from under neieth me. A good experience.

I don't believe in much. Having no faith sort of pulls you apart from society because our society was built on a christian foundation. Take our laws. Don't kill. Don't steal. Don't borrow peoples mail with the intent to burn it and return the black ashes to thier mailbox along with a steamer you had brewing since early that morning after eating six chillies. And for the Lords sake! make sure your taxi has a bail of hay in the boot. Otherwise <i>bad</i> things will happen *insert arched eyebrow here*.
<i>(Note: that is sort of in the ball park of an actually law somewhere. It was pulled from memory though and may not be 100% correct. Possibly 75-80%...)</i>

Anyhoos that said, due to the will of some... thing... more powerful than myself, I am now in the possesion of my trusty thrusty wallet. The one I lost many moons ago. With all my cards in there... as well as the speeding fine I got. Heh :D I left it in there. Woe is me. But I'm stoked.

Something I'm not so stoked about is that I'm not going camping with Crazy this weekend. If I haven't mentioned that I was going on here... then erase that last sentence from your mind. And this one. And that one. And this one in reference to that last one, as well as that last one. And done. Though you should probably ignore that last sentence. Why? What am I talking about? You're the one with all the answers! You with your bright purple overcoat and jaded sence of self worth. You with the huge pay and the super cool Datsun, white, with that cool knocking sound you get when it's in 3rd. What!? What was that? OH! The saucy steak pudding not good enough!? Want me to just dip it back in the frier for 5 minutes? Not heart attack worthy for ya? No? Ohhh KAAYYY Sir. My most humble apoligy.

I want to be a bar tender. That'll be cool. Somewhere with live music. Live music is the best. Anyhoos on that note I'm gonna finish up by saying that Wednesday night I went and saw the <a href=""http://www.thewhitlams.com/NEWS/""> Whitlams.</a> It was good. But for me, the band that stole the show was a little Melbourne band called <a href=""http://www.manbitesgod.com"">Man Bites God</a>. I've bought their latest CD and they rock. Fucken awesome. So if you're ever downloading stuff... make a couple of illegal ones and get some Man Bites God. Or you could search through their <a href=""http://www.manbitesgod.com"">website</a> and might be lucky enough to find some freebies. Anyhoos it was a great night and I'd like to thank Mat and Okey and Bassett for coming and letting me dance like a looney. Sorry if I embarresed you guys. But I was sober. I had to work the next morning (got to bed at 2am thrusday. 4 hours sleep is fun!)

Anyways... heres some photos... catch peeps.

I had more! and movies but my phone died in the arse! </lj-cut>Also I was going to spell check this entry but now I can't be stuffed. If you see a word try and work it out. If you have no idea of what the word could be then you might just amuse yourself trying to invent a possible answer. I know I have."

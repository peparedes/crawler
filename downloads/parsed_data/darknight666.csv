"event","......well first off this is about the people of all....not just one person in mind....i mean all people around. Well for one what do people think of when they do something.....do they think it through?...or do they stab in the dark like a night predator?....to me...well it as simple as standing back and looking at the situation you are about to go through and do. People now-a-days tend to well...be lazy.....not just in the physical aspect but in the mind set. It does take but what 5-10min. to think what if i do this...o.k. bad consequence...what if i try this way. But no they just start doing what seems natural.....""Being Animal in Human Nature"". It's like we revert to our caveman ways...i am sure...i do tend to jump the gun.....sometimes....unlike most people i actually think things through and see several ways to do it. To me we will never over bound this gigantic hurdle that always seems to be in the back of our mind ready to explode when needed like serum of sorts. In the end.....people need to learn that life IS short and take a step back calm down relax look at things more closely. Look at things in a different perspective...not just a one-way road so to speak. If anything looking at thing more inwardly has given me a better outlook on life and the human race as a whole. I suggest all people do just take time out of there day and you know......meditate....no one has no idea how much it actually does work until they actually try it. Though you know i am a no one apparently and soon you will think so too probably i know nothing...or do i?....things to think about in your own time. Everyone has 5-10 min. i don't care if you are the president of the united states or a guy working at a fast food joint....you can do it...every can. We as human being are suppose to be among the smartest things on this planet....yet look at all the things we do. Drugs....alchol....numerous thing not just the easy things like....you have anger problems right?...so go take some anger management classes instead of taking drugs and taking it out on family members and friends. The things you need to realize is that no matter what family is almost always there for you. No matter if you think they hate you or not regardless of your personally extreme aspect of them. To close this terrible rambling on my mind....well people lighten up...life is short do what you want when you want let no one get in your way....life is too short."

"event","I am finally on a path....i well assorted and very difficult path if i might say so. The fact that there are so many names to remember are intriguing to say the least. I have chosen the Egyptian path as my first path...my teacher tells me that i have decided to choose one of the most difficult one and i laughed and said of course i did. I have always had a fascination with the culture and the religion...the fact that they embrace death as being so comfortable with it intrigued me so. Egyptians sort of see it as a beautiful act and have so embraced it as such with beauty and gracefulness. I have always had a fascination with death...but who has not? Their temples are just aw inspiring to me and they treat the gods as...well it is indescribable really and i love the honor and loyalty they treat the gods with. Without my teacher though i could say i would be lost without his guidance. Since i have started a little while back i guess you could say i look back at the past and see why some of the things happen and why they need to happen. All things have a point and place for things to happen whether in the next day or next year all will come to those who wait.

The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

You were female in your last earthly incarnation.

You were born somewhere around the territory of what is now know as modern Tailand, approximately in the year 700.

Your profession was: monk, bee-keeper, lone gunman.

A brief psychological profile of you in that past life:
Inquisitive, inventive, liked to get to the very bottom of things and to rummage in books. Talent for drama, natural born actor.

A lesson that your last past life wishes you to learn in your present life is:
Your lesson -- to learn discretion and reasonability and then teach others to do that. Your life will be happier, when you help those who lack reasoning.


           sincerely,

It's nothing big, really, I just wanted to have a post for it and not only some links in the sidebar that are easy to overlook...

<lj-cut text=""Lyric/FF Journal""><u><a href=""http://hanashi-flower.livejournal.com"">Lyric/FF Journal</a></u>

So this is where I keep my fanfictions and lyric romanizations.
There aren't that many FFs so I didn't feel like making a master post for that. If anyone's interested in reading them (at your own risk >.< *hates her own writing*), feel free to make use of the 'fanfiction' tag ^^

As far as lyrics are concerned, I haven't quite finished all the information posts yet <strike>(and some of them might also be quite useless, but whatever)</strike>, however, the project list is up already, <a href=""http://hanashi-flower.livejournal.com/21713.html"">here</a>, as well as master posts for KAT-TUN/Arashi/NewS/Special Units in <a href=""http://hanashi-flower.livejournal.com/21431.html"">Alphabetical Order</a> and <a href=""http://hanashi-flower.livejournal.com/17394.html"">Chronological Order</a>.
Other groups will be added as I get around to doing their lyrics.

Please keep in mind that this is primarily something I do for myself. It's a good way of practicing Japanese and I also very likely won't promote this anywhere since there are others who have done JE lyric homepages already. I actually wanted to add links to said homepages to the sidebar but my computer died recently and with it my bookmarks, so I will have to find those sites first before I can add them <.<
You might argue that it's not necessary to have one million romanizations of JE songs because they're basically all the same. There are minor differences, however, since everyone has preferences as to how they romanize and since there <i>are</i> different systems to use and not everybody likes to use the same. And again, I do this for myself. It's fun. It provides me with lyrics in a style I feel comfortable reading, and what's best, this style is consistent since I do them all by myself. 
It takes quite some time, so I you stumble over this for some reason and find something not to your liking, don't slash away at me, please ^^;;
For more information, please refer to the various info/master posts at the journal itself.

<lj-cut text=""Media Journal""><u><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/niji_no_iro"">Media Journal</a></u>
<small>(which is actually not a journal but a community :P)</small>

This is the place where I dump my scans, mp3 rips, screencap spams, etc.
Look around and see if you find something you like. It's still quite empty, but stuff will be added as I feel like it <strike>(and I'm a pretty lazy person >.<)</strike>.
Things are uploaded to both Megaupload and Mediafire. The MU links should all still be active, but feel free to ask for a re-upload if they aren't. <strike>MF links for most of the files have expired or whatever happened to them, but I'm in the process of re-uploading those.</strike> DONE!

So that's that.
It might be weird to have three journals. But I have a problem with spamming. Or posting in general. I'm constantly afraid of spamming someone's friend list, even if it's only two or three people, so I feel better when they're seperated by use ^^;;
This journal is the main one, though, and I will probably fake-cut to the others from time to time to keep track of what I'm doing myself XDDD
</lj-cut>

Feel free to ignore this post if you don't care about it or think it's stupid or anything. ^^;;"

Anyway.

Seriously?
SERIOUSLY?!?
For weeks, heck, <i>months</i> I've been stalking Yesasia on a daily basis, more often than not several times a day, waiting for the new Arashi album to be announced, and now <i>this</i>?!?. Tonight/this morning at 2 or 3 a.m. where I live (so at about 8 or 9 a.m. in Asia) I checked and nothing was there. At 11 p.m. I see a notification from Playasia.com in my e-mails, which means two things: a) something (most likely the album) has been announced, and b) since Playasia always seems to be a bit behind Yesasia updating-wise, the album will most likely be out of stock on Yesasia already, because it's an Arashi album and the fans are insanely fast....oh, how I hate to be right >.>
Thankfully they must have only just put it up on Playasia, since the Limited Edition was still available, so I ordered from there for the first time in my life. Hope it'll work out fine and I get the right version o.O
I know Yesasia will most likely re-stock at some point. However, as I've pointed out before, their re-stocking behaviour seems a bit erratic and entirely random at times and I will not risk missing my one chance to get the LE when it's still easy to do...even though I would have preferred buying it from Yesasia, as I wanted to order something else with it...guess that'll have to wait <.<
Seriously, this is not normal. How can their albums be gone this quickly every single time?
With Popcorn I totally lucked out since I had to pull an all-nighter thanks to piled up and deadline-due university stuff, so I apparently logged into Yesasia shortly after it was put up and had no problem whatsoever, but that's been the one exception. Geez. I still remember the great 'Boku no Mite iru Fuukei' panic *shudders* *overdramatic* XP
Now I'll be all nervous until this arrives. Good thing it won't be released until the end of October T_T
<strike>On a positive side, it'll be interesting to see whether or not the parcel will get stuck in customs. I hope not, that'd be a total drag XP Also, I'm curious as to how fast it will arrive.</strike> It <i>did</i> get stuck in customs <.< And since the customs office in my area moved into the most remote part of town possible, it takes forever to get there. Also, I only had to pay 5 Euros for it, essentially making my train ticket more expensive than the customs >.> But at least I finally have my CD o^_^o It only took it 3 weeks to get here, too, so that was nice for a change :P And the LE packaging looks amazing, so stylish! *_*
I really wonder what changed for Yesasia's delivery time to be altered so drastically. My latest order from them was dispatched on the 5th of August. The poster that surprisingly was added and was sent separately on the same day arrived 1 1/2 weeks ago, within the estimated time it was supposed to take. Let's wait and see how many weeks will have passed before the main part of my order arrives XP

I graduated from university about three weeks ago, by the way :P Now I'll have to find a job. It's not that I don't want a job, I do, so I can finally get my own place, some privacy and a life in one go XP
It's just that the whole process of searching for a job is so annoying. It also seems to make me miserable, my mood swings are worse than ever >.<
Does anyone know a good method to cure being miserable? I could need one, like, now. Pretty please? ^^;;"

"event","Yay, my Endless Game CDs finally arrived today :D
Only took them two months this time! ...<.<
Well, at least I know to expect that by now. Which is kinda sad. Really, really sad. I like to think back to the good old days when I could expect Yesasia parcels to arrive after a week, two at most. Now I think it's fast if they only take a month...*sighs*
Well, at least they <i>do</i> arrive and never get stuck in customs, so that's something, isn't it :P

So, what is tomorrow?: right, Animagic!:D
I'll definitely be there on Saturday. Me and my friend managed to get some tickets online from people who couldn't go and they've already been transferred to our names and sent to my friend per e-mail, so that's awesome :)
Now I only need to wait for my friend to tell me whether or not she'll have to work tomorrow, because if she doesn't then we'll get to go both days, which would be awesome. If not, we'll need to cancel our reservation with the hotel and leave early on Saturday morning, so we'll be there for Hideo Baba's presentation :DDD (I'm really looking forward to that. Last year's was pretty amazing already, and I believe this year'll be the same. He's amazing ^^)
It would be great if we could go on both days, but I'll be happy either way, since I thought we wouldn't be going at all this year, so yaaaaaaaaaaay :DDD

And maybe my university will finally let me know (within the next week, hopefully), if I passed my BA thesis paper thingy or not. Chances are I did, but I don't know how well I did. I just wanna know and get my certificate, preferably in this century -.-
Isn't it nice that it says we have exactly 9 weeks to write it, from the day we hand in our application for it, and that the professors' correction time ""should not exceed"" 6 weeks? <.<
This ""should"" is such a nice word. I handed my paper in on May, 22nd. Today is July, 25th and nothing has happened yet. When I asked two weeks ago, shortly after the 6 weeks had passed, they still couldn't tell me anything. But they also said I didn't have to report back for the next semester and that they were planning to have me there for the graduation ceremony...which is tomorrow, by the way.
So this is really strange. On the one hand I would expect that I passed, seeing as they (the professors correcting the paper) were so sure I'd be graduating tomorrow, on the other hand the thesis isn't marked yet, so they shouldn't be able to hand me out a certificate tomorrow, even if I had the time to go there. Unsurprisingly, I'm confused @_@
I just want to know. And I just want to finish this and finally search for a job. Sure, I can already write applications and stuff, but I don't want to get too hyped up over starting to work and then be smacked to the ground if they tell me ""Sorry, you've been misinformed, you failed that thesis, you're gonna have to rewrite it"".
At least I'm not having panic attacks anymore. I'm still anxious, I'm not gonna lie about that, but other than that it's fine. In the days right after I handed the thesis in, I was a wreck XD
I hadn't slept in two days, and just barely finished, which is entirely my fault because I miscalculated on the time I would need >.<
And because I'd been up for such a long time I missed some horrible typos, which didn't help with the anxiety at all ^^;;

Still haven't watched Arafes >.<
Also haven't watched Popcorn yet. This is getting ridiculous ^^;;
I will watch them. I will. One day I'll think ""now I want to see them"" and then I'll put a DVD in and start :P
It kills me, though, that they've said there's gonna be a new album soon, but not exactly when it will be officially announced. Because of this I've been stalking Yesasia like crazy XD They'd better not announce it during the next two days, though, or I'd be so pissed >.<
Well, it would still be okay, if Yesasia restocked often enough. I still don't get that. Sometimes they restock a thousand times and the LEs are available for a very long time, and then at other times, they maybe restock once and then they are gone forever. Like with Arafes. I wanted that Lyrics booklet, dammit T_T Also, it looks weird to have a normal DVD inbetween all the special packaged ones XP
However, I'm gonna be positive about this for now, since it worked out for both of their latest albums ^^;;"

"event","These days, I can't f***ing breathe, my live sucks so bad right now. And I really wish I could blame somebody else for it, but it's a fact that this is all my fault; I'm the one who got me into this mess, and I'm the only one who can get myself out of it. I've been procrastinating and hiding and running away for more than six months now and I just wanna get out of it in one piece, at the same time avoiding everything I have to do, but there's just no way around it. In order to get past this, I have to <i>literally</i> work myself through it.
I'm probably not even making any sense. Not naming the actual problem might have something to do with it :P
But do you know the feeling of a single thought being able to take your breath away in panic? Every single day? And being unable to do anything about it? Although, strictly speaking, that's not true. Physically, I am very much able to do something about it, it's just that my frickin' mind won't comply and is instead sabotaging me into insanity. Now, ain't that awesome *sarcasm*

On another, totally or maybe not so unrelated note, I <i>have</i> to watch Arafes. It's been in my shelf for ages now, it's been released for even longer, and I still haven't watched it >.<
I intended to do so when my family went away for the holidays, because I want to watch it downstairs in the living room, on the big TV, with the good sound system, and not on my teeny-weeny-tiny television screen.
But as it turns out not only did my brother (the one that still lives with us) stay home, no, he also invited his girlfriend over. For the weekend. Or so I thought. In fact, she stayed for the entire week. And while she's nice and all, I went crazy during that week. I felt like a trespasser in my own house after a while, it was horrible. Plus, neither my brother nor she apparently are neat-freaks, and I'm not all that much either, but wherever they went in the house, they left a garbage and dirt trail, it was disgusting. If I had to chose, the most icky thing would probably be them not cleaning the toilet after her throwing up one day. Still sounds pretty harmless, so why be so upset about it? Well, I didn't know she threw up until my family came back and my mother told me...about both the throwing up and the pieces of I-don't-even-want-to-know still stuck underneath the toilet seat. Yummy. So apparently, for the last couple of days, I unknowingly pretty much sat on her vomit. Who doesn't clean the toilet after that?!? Everything needed to clean it is right next to it, so that couldn't even be an excuse. Seriously!
If she had only been there for the weekend, I could have coped with it. But it was just too long, and I was getting really pissed off at them for not being able to watch my DVD in peace and at full volume, grinning and bouncing like a crazy person. At the weekend I could cheer myself up with the thought that on Mondays my brother is always at my father's place, so I would have at least that day to myself. But since the girlfriend was here, he didn't go, so double-pissed-off me on the verge of hitting something. What was also annoying was that my brother had to work during the week, which left her staying here at home all day, wandering the hallways and being an increasingly un-welcomed presence ruining my days.
Also, if you know you are going away for a week, wouldn't you pack your own stuff to take along? She had, like, a mascara, an eyeliner and fake eyelashes. Other than that she just used my sister's make-up, her expensive shampoo, and so on, and even took along a skirt my sister had lent her, when she went back home. She had it on when she left, and my sister only found out when it was already too late. On top of everything else, she wasn't all that happy about that.
My week was crowned off by the fact that the day she went home, I got my monthly-dreaded visit by the red witch (:P), and reached into the box of tampons (feel free to mentally replace the word with you-know-what if you can't take it :P) next to the toilet, only to find it empty. I.was.so.pissed.off!
Thankfully I always have some spare ones in my bag, so that was lucky, but still, SERIOUSLY?!?
You cannot just empty that in a household that is not your own and not either replace it or at least tell me about it. I mean, come on, use your brain. There were still a few left. Not that many, but enough for me to not feel the need to buy a new box already. Seeing as there were not so many left, one might imagine that the people in this house using them might know about this, you know, having left the box like that after last time, and might expect it to still be that way when the need arises again. Also, as a woman you know when the monthly visit is due and prepare accordingly. And if you forget, you go to the supermarket and buy some.
So imagine my joy at realising that AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE (am I repeating myself?) she even used up all of the remaining contents of that box. You don't do that. It would have been okay, if she had realised she didn't bring anything and had asked if she could use them. But just taking them and pretending like it never happened even though the box is clearly empty and this is so far from being sneaky it should be funny, that's just rude.
Even more so because she and my brother haven't even been together for that long and that was, like, the second time I'd even seen her. As far as gaining sympathy points with your boyfriend's family goes, this week really didn't do her any good.

Good, got that out of my system XP
Where was I? Right, Arafes.
Need to watch it. Soon. Because I need Arashi so badly right now to get my mood into the direction of something resembling positive. Because it has both Gimmick Game and Tokei Jikake no Umbrella. Because it has Arashi as backdancers. And because it has OHMIYA SK, HOLY CRAP!!! How did I miss this?!? Why wasn't this all over everywhere?!? And if it was, where the hell was I?!?!?!?
XD
Might resort to watching it on my TV after all, though, because the chances of me having three hours to myself in this house, at a time that isn't early in the morning when I'm still sleeping, are pretty slim T_T

Need to go to bed now, because it is <i>not</i> 5:38 in the morning *denial* XDD"

"event","+ Turns out I like Rum and Coke. With just a bit of dark rum and lots of coke. Enough rum so the taste comes through, enough coke so the bitter taste of the alcohol doesn't :)
As I don't like most alcoholic drinks out there, this is pretty neat ^^

+ Am newly into Sherlock Holmes, Castle, and Criminal Minds Slash fandoms, complete with having read a week's worth of fanfiction 8D

+ Criminal Minds slash, especially when Derek and Spencer are concerned, is amazing on LJ but scary on Youtube. Seriously, every other video even remotely related to Shemar Moore and/or Matthew Gray Gubler is spammed by 13-year-olds proclaiming their undying love to the two and bitching at every woman (or human in general) who even so much as gives either of them a friendly smile...and subsequently bitching at each other over not having bitched at anyone in the first place. It's scary. And mildly disturbing. I chose to walk away. Thank you, dear LJ fandom people for being sane. Thank you so much.

+ I'm yet to find any Sherlock Holmes fanfiction that manages to characterize Holmes and Watson the way I perceive them from the TV series.

+ Castle is an amazing show, period. I always loved Ryan and Esposito and their bantering and intrusion of each others' personal space. It wasn't until I read the amazing fanfictions on LJ that I realized how much I wanted to see the bantering turn into something else ^^

+ The more time I spend reading fanfiction, the more kinks of mine come to the surface. There's various things now, among others a hand fetish, an unhealthy obsession with dimples (because <i>seriously</i> *_*), a language, a water and a submission kink.

+ I really wish I could read peoples' minds, if only for a day, or see myself through other peoples' eyes to get an honest outsider's perspective. I just get so caught up in my mind and my thoughts sometimes that it'd be interesting to see things from another point of view, be able to take a step back and really look and see what I'd find.

+ I don't like Madonna. There, it's out :P The only song of her I ever liked was Frozen back when I was a teenager and I think the main reason I liked it was because of the video and the long black hair XD The rest of her music just doesn't go with me, dunno why, it just doesn't.
Also can't really warm up to her as a person. To me she's just very ridiculous and not in a good way. I know she's somewhat iconic and her level of popularity equalled that of Michael Jackson, but I've never been a fan of liking someone and/or there music just because everybody else does. And telling myself I like her won't make it happen so there you have it, I don't. Michael Jackson was amazing, though :P Hate to know that he's dead. And people may think what they want, somehow I just can't believe that he did anything to those boys. It just doesn't fit his personality. Yeah, I know, you'll never be able to look into a person's mind and, yes, in many cases that might be a good thing, but for god's sake, the man was still halfway a child at mind. You tell me he enjoyed being around children, I fully agree. You tell me he'd ever do anything to those children to hurt them, that is your opinion but not mine. It's more society's warped mind frowning at him being carefree because he's not behaving in a way a grown man should by society's standards. All the stupid rapists who do hurt innocent children don't help the image. And there's always some low-scum people who use the publicity to try to get some money out of nothing like this, not caring what they do to the person they accuse, it's despicable.

+ How did this post turn out so serious? I may be half-drunk, but that can't be the reason because alcohol always makes me very content and happy. Unless I drink too much, then it just makes me sick and throw up XP And 'too much' in my case isn't really all that much, since I don't hold my liquor well <i>at all</i> ^^;;"

Have to write two term papers within the next two weeks, one of which I wanted to have finished a week ago and I haven't even started.
I've been procrastinating on that one for over 2 years now because I don't have a deadline, which I thought was neat at first, but is totally kicking my butt now >.<
'bad thing is, I should finish that one before the other one - which <i>has</i> a deadline by the way, hence the two weeks - so I'll be on the safe side as far as my study plan is concerned and I just CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO START WRITING THE DAMN THING, DAMMIT!
Also, these two term papers and a short report are the only things I have left to do before I can register for my BA paper so I'll be done with my studies. This should be motivation enough to just get it over with, or so you would think, but my brain seems to work in ways mysterious even to me >.>
Been having other issues for a while now too, so this whole situation is really starting to suck a lot and I just want a way out, get away from everything, but know full well that the only way out of this is to just start doing something, surprise -.-

I wanna f***ing cry and scream and rage and laugh and love and everything. Wanna do the stuff I feel like doing and not just think about doing them and stay put where I am doing nothing, which is the most stupid reaction ever, how dependent can you be, seriously? I feel f***ing paralyzed, like I'm imprisoned in my own skin and my mind is laughing at me for being such a dumbass loser and then I think 'what the effing crap' 'cause I didn't used to be that way, what the hell happened and how can I undo it?!?"

"event","Ok, this is kind of random, but my Computer had to be re-configured and upon restoring my desktop back to its previous state I found the 'Oregon Trail' game again and just had to play it.
It's sort of become a habit to set out into the west with my trusty Arashi team and by default there's usually a lot of crack involved, it's so much fun XD

So, this time I started on medium difficulty and in April.
A week later, on April 7th, I reached the first landmark, the Kansas River. I usually float over that one and the next, because anything else is a bother and it normally isn't a problem with these two rivers...well XD
This is what happened:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/hubbelbu/pic/00007z4b/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/hubbelbu/pic/00007z4b"" width=""562"" height=""386"" border=""0"" /></a>

XDDD
It just made me crack up so bad, it's so deadpan XDDD

Plus, it's a record for me, I've never lost anyone this early on the trail, poor Jun XD

A short while later Sho broke his leg. Knowing how easily people can die from broken limbs in this game, I was kind of worried ^^;; Thankfully, he stayed alive...at least until he got a fever a couple of weeks later. Then, it only took im two days and he was dead <.<

I'm still not entirely sure how the others survived, seriously XD
Shortly after Sho's death, Nino also broke his leg (again, worried :P), then got typhoid and the measles. Clearly he wasn't in shape to do anything even closely related to navigating anymore, so from this point onwards Ohba team lost the trail every other day >.<
Since Sho died from a broken leg and a fever, Nino must be the luckiest brat in the world, as a broken leg, typhoid and measles obviously wasn't bad enough already and he ended up also breaking his arm, and he STILL stayed alive XD
Aiba eventually followed the trend and finally broke his leg as well, and because that alone would have been totally lame, he also got himself a nice cholera :P
Miraculously my sleepy wagon driver Ohno got through the trip without even being mentioned once XDDD Maybe all the sleeping he did that made Arashi lose their way kept him healthy? :P

In the end, I barely made it. Half my bullets had drowned along with Jun (*snickers* XDD) and most of the other half got stolen halfway along the trail, so hunting was reduced to a minimum. Since I lost a lot of food and all my wagon axles right at the beginning, I at least could go re-buy them at the next Fort, but that left me with just enough money to pay the ferry for that one big river. Still, I somehow had enough food, with what I bought at the beginning and some minimum hunting, to get me through the trail. Had about 100-150 pounds left ^^;;
My wagon also spontaneously combusted while I was in the desert, taking away 6 of my spare clothing sets, leaving me 4, 2 of which I gave the Indian to guide me over the other river. Also, it destroyed almost all my wagon repair parts and killed an ox.
In retrospect, though, I have to admit that as far as the oxen are concerned, I was lucky. Apart from the one that died in the fire, I only lost another one that just dropped dead, so I still had I think 6 left.
When I played the game another time, I remember losing so many oxen that I reached the goal with only 1 left XD"

"event","Ok, so the album got released a month ago. It arrived at my place about 1-2 weeks later.
And I only got around to listening to it now ^^;;
But, damn, it's so good!!! Might even be the best one to this date, well, along with Boku no Mite iru Fuukei and Time, which are my all-time favourites :)
I'm totally in love with ""morning light"" and ""always"", but I also like ""Rock this"", ""Mada minu Sekai e"" and ""negai"". ""To be free"" and ""Lotus"" are loveable, too, already loved them singles :D
Out of the solos, Nino's is probably my favourite. I can't help smiling when I listen to it, it's so beautiful. ...the sap XD
I was really surprised when listening to Matsujun's solo, 'cause I really like it! oO It's the best out of all of his solos, imo, right after ""La Familia"". And after overcoming my hatred for it (and because of the performance on the con DVD, adorable is all I have to say o^_^o) ""Yabai Yabai Yabai"" kind of grew on me too ^^
When Ohno's solo started I thought it was Sho's XD
No, seriously, from the music at the beginning, it totally sounded like a Sho solo ^^;; But I kinda like it *glomps Oh-chan* :D 
Aiba's is good too. I always like his solos, cause they're so Aiba-ish XD
Stylish and fun :D
...about Sho's solo...there is just something about his solos that leaves me helpless for a reaction ^^;; I liked ""Unti Unti"" and ""Hip Pop Boogie"", but other than that I can't really warm up to his solos *bows* Gomen! >.<
It's kinda funny, because had Ohno's solo really been Sho's I might have liked it XP
T.A.B.O.O is growing on me lately, though, give me a few more times to listen to it and I'll be all over that one XP


<small>Great, I totally can't get that picture of Sho and the cat from that AnS (?, or was it HnA? oO) out of my mind, it's so cute *_*</small>"

I always wondered why other people have problems finding time to update their journals as soon as university starts again, but now I totally get it <.<
During my first semester I didn't update at all and it might just happen all over again this semester - this post excluded. The only times I ever <i>do</i> update are when I'm running away from work I have to do, like, e.g., papers <.< (I did manage to finish it, btw, after pulling an all-nighter :P, but I haven't got any feedback yet *cringe*), or reviews...it's just that I haven't written any reviews yet and apart from that guideline they gave us I have no idea what to write about that stupid text >.<
I have to write it, though, because if I don't, I'll fail that course and will have to re-do it in another semester *sighs* At least I managed to avoid having to do that speech ^_^v"""" ...^^;; ...what? I really didn't want to do it, and they gave us the choice not to, so I took that chance :P
If only the review wasn't due tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock...^^;; *fail* *fail* *FAAAAAIIIIL*
XDDD

Change of topic, please... XDD

I got myself a new DVD player, yay, yay, double-yay, triple-yay, YAAAAAYYY!!!! (Just ignore me, it will stop eventually <.<)
It's amazing. And it's region-free. Which is why it's amazing. And the reason why I bought it, duh. But it's even more amazing than that. And <i>that</i> I didn't now beforehand. It can play videos from burned discs and from USB *__* And not just videos burned on DVDs but videos burned on data discs so that I can fit more on them. It just plays them!!! *eternally happy* o^___^o
Maybe it's not even that special and everyone has that already, idk, but to me it means the world *kicks crappy old DVD player-san into the Netherworld* --> *accidentally kills Laharl and gets crowned the new Overlord* *muahahahaha*....ehm...yeah...eh...so much for that? ^^;;

The first thing I did was to re-watch Maou ^____^ It's still so f****** amazing! *___* Makes me want to watch it again XD
I really wish there was a way to revive Naruse so that I could see Ohno play him again. You know, with the hairstyle and all? XDDD *obsessed desu* XDDDDDDDDDD
Hey, it's not my fault he looks completely hot with it *drooling again* 's not that he's not hot without it, but, but sdfrkljfjaafehjahksfheiorfaweaeruasjdf, ne? XDDD
I still have to continue watching Uta no Onii-san. Am done with the first two eps and just have to get myself to continue. It's just that for some reason I've always been close to tears by the end of the eps and I have to watch them at times when that doesn't matter, a.k.a. nobody will walk in on me, and at the moment I'm always asleep when that time approaches _._

Is it just me or is that post entirely pointless? ^^;;

I'm working on new lyrics again. Maybe that will finally make me listen to all the latest singles and albums. They've been on my PC ever since their respective release dates but I seem to be stuck in the past -.-;;
Well, as soon as I'm done with the newer ones I'll have to go back to older ones anyway, so it's not that much of a problem to be stuck itp I guess...

I'm hungry... =.=

And watching my moodtheme makes me realize that I need a dose of Ohmiya. Maybe I'll be able to do my homework then.
Ohmiya makes everything better.

"event","So, ehm, I still haven't started on my paper and it's due on Monday...I'm so screwed...
And I just won't panic T__T The thing is that I need to in order to sit down and just do it (yes, I'm pathetic like that -.-;;).
I had two months to get this done and now it's four days, FOUR F****** DAYS and all I did was to start reading some books on the topic about a week ago <.<
What the hell have I been doing during those past 2 months? Oh, right, N.O.T.H.I.N.G.! Just been sitting around playing games and reading fanfiction and watching videos, going out with some friends, etc., because I always thought 'well, there's still so much time left, no problem'... *rollseyes*
I knew it would turn out like this, I just KNEW, and still... *sighs* I fail at life...

...

Well, so much for my self-pity ^^;;
At least it did have some nice side-effects, for I needed something to keep me from actually having to sit down and start working, so I finished watching some dramas (happy boys, shibatora, ryuusei no kizuna, etc.) and, more importantly, I finally updated my side-journal! 
Yes, believe it or not, tons of new lyrics are up, yaaay! ^__^ Took me four days to get them all up (=_=), but it was totally worth it ^^
It's still only Kanji and Romaji (because half a year of actual Japanese lessons certainly aren't enough to enable me to translate properly O.o), but romanizing is perfect to practice kanji, and doing so with JE lyrics provides me with lyrics to sing along to, which is kind of nice, so I won't stop and thought I might as well share o^___^o
Anyway, this means KAT-TUN and NewS' discographies are almost complete now (only missing the most recent releases of both, some tracks in NewS' case, and some of KAT-TUN's DVD Booklet lyrics that I'm still working on), and the Special Units (GYM, Tegomasu, Shuji to Akira, Yamashita Tomohisa) are done completely. I also added a few more of Arashi's lyrics, but of course they are still missing a lot >.< I hope to soon be able to buy some of their CDs of which no booklet scans have been uploaded. This way I can scan them myself and then transcribe the lyrics.
However, since most of the older singles and albums are not available anymore I'll just have to hope for somebody to upload decent booklet scans of those instead (or be really, really lucky and find those CDs somewhere for a reasonable price ^^;;).

I should really go to bed now, because I plan to go to university tomorrow to finally get some work done and if I drag this out much longer I'll oversleep again and the library will have closed by the time I'm ready to go <.<
This might sound really Do-M, but seriously, can somebody kick my ass really hard? I apparently need it XD

Ja, mata ne~

I can't believe it's been four months since the last time I updated O.o 
Time goes by so fast T_T

The first semester of my Japanese studies has ended (well, officially, it still lasts until the end of February, but whatever :P), I know I made it through 3 of 4 exams, though one of them probably won't have the best grade, I hope I also made it through the last (T__T), but I won't know for sure until the results are out, and my internet finally works again after an agonizing month without it.
Starting mid-March I will hopefully be able to enjoy my free time because the paper I have to write for Japanese History is due at that time. I do have a topic (had to hold a presentation on it and all), but for the paper I have to decide on something specific within that topic and I have no idea what to choose >.<
I should probably do the glossary first, so I'll have an overview of the people, events, etc., but at some point I will have to decide what to do, and I have a feeling that I'll be procrastinating to the point again, where I panic because I don't have any time left <.<

I still haven't updated my other journal with the lyrics. This sucks. They're all here on my computer, but I'm just too lazy to get them up *sighs*

Oh, and I finally bought a Nintendo DS ^_^v""""
I've been playing Harvest Moon DS for the past week, wasting entire days on that and driving myself insane with it XDDD
But it's so much fun! ^__^

I'm still catching up to all the Arashi stuff I missed, so that too takes up a lot of time. There are also still so many dramas I want to dl and watch >.<
I might continue to watch G no Arashi, or maybe the new KAT-TUN con now, I'll see. 

Arashi still hasn't announced any new DVD. That was okay up till now, since I wouldn't have been able to buy it in the past month, but now that I have access to the internet again I wish they would just go ahead and announce it. And not only an AAA DVD but one of the Dream'A'live tour, please! Not just because it has Ohno with Maou hair (yes, I'm still obsessed with it and currently sulking seeing as it's gone T_T), but also because it has Nino doing that amazing Gimmick Game performance, and of course many, many songs I want to see performed, dammit!

You would think I had more to write after not posting anything for this long, but actually I'm already finished for now, I guess ^^;;

I'm tired. I should go to bed. But I guess I will watch a few more videos before I do that XD

I'm stupid.
XDDD

"event","I just watched the last episode of Maou...
...
...
Honestly, I was expecting something like this. It was the most logical ending that both of them would have to die, but still...
I cried so hard >.<
That last scene of them meeting is so intense. Naruse's expressions...? You could read him like a book. The moment when realisation set in that Naoto wouldn't kill him, the desperation with which he asked, begged, screamed, <i>pleaded</i> for him to just shoot him *shudders*
Naruse never wanted Naoto to die.
He wanted him to suffer enough so that he'd kill him, but he never wanted him to die.
But the fact that Naoto didn't <i>want</i> to kill Hideo 11 years ago, that it was all an accident, and that he felt remorse for what it did to Tomoo's mother and Tomoo himself, is something that Naruse couldn't have known. He never expected Naoto to not want to kill him after all he did.
Naruse never wanted to kill Naoto. Naoto's existence was the only thing that tied him to that fucked up life of his. It's something that even Shiori couldn't do.
Sure, Naruse had already been stabbed by Yamano (the only one of them who really was crazy), but he might have made it, if he'd called the ambulance for Naoto (but, no, Naoto had to stop him *rollseyes*).
*sighs*
I missed the beginning of the episode, though. It's all TVU Player's fault for not having TBS (or any other good Japanese channel) <i>on a Friday</i>!!! O.O
So I went to TVU's forum and there, someone mentioned two other possibilities to watch Japanese channels. The first led to KeyHole's homepage (but KH sucks! It never works right on my PC) and the second to some other programme called Livestation. So I downloaded that to try it and while it was being installed searched for Japanese channels on the homepage, because you have to add them yourselves. It neither had NTV, Fuji TV or Asahi TV, BUT it had TBS *___* (and TV Tokyo, so if I ever feel like watching anything there now, I can ^_^v).
And it worked!!! I could even watch it in full view, something that I can't with TVU. It was a bit blurry, but not more than it would have been in TVU, especially when there were fast movements, but it was perfect enough.
When the channel started, the first thing I saw was Naoto's father crying over his other son's death...wtf?!? O.o When did he die? I mean, okay, he murdered Souda, his wife left him for the guy he wanted to push the blame onto and his own brother came to get him arrested, but really, there must have been some hope left...somewhere...<.<
And, <i>of course</i>, Naoto's father had to get a heart attack. I should have expected that. Why didn't I expect his brother killing himself? It makes perfect sense. With his brother gone and his father dying because of that loss, it makes Naoto and Naruse even. He knows exactly how he felt back then now. Actually, he's even worse off, because he also lost all of his childhood friends. Sure enough, we get the obligatory 'I'm-so-pissed-off-I-don't-care-anymore-I'm-gonna-kill-that-bastard!'-look as Naoto storms off to meet Naruse. And, well, we know what happened then...T_____T
And again, Shiori was the first witness, the poor thing.
I don't really understand the ending, though. I mean, it makes sense that they can't just leave it off with both of them being dead, but what's with that walk on the beach. I guess I'll have to wait for subs to understand a bit about that...or maybe there's just no point in it, I don't know.
But I want to know what she saw when she touched that harmonica, dammit. How can they stop there. I want to see that!!! *throwing a fit*
Still, I love this series to bits and pieces. It was brilliant, Ohno's acting is just asdfljkaflj <i>SO GOOD</i>!!!!!!, I could finally sympathize with Naoto at the end and it was all planned out amazingly, shockingly even, well.
<strike>I just wish that Yamano had got his fair share. His little solo performances interfered with Naruse's plan at the most inappropriate times, and there seriously is something wrong in his little revenge/hatred-consumed brain. Why did he have to kill Kasai. To complete what he had started? Killing off everybody who used to bully him? Yeah, so we get to know that, apparently, the police is searching for him, but wtf, that guy has to be locked away! *hmpf*</strike> Ok, so I do know now that he was actually shot, and that I can definitely live with *nods* ^^
I'm super excited for subs now. Firstly, because I want to watch the beginning, but won't bother to download the raw files just for that, and secondly, because, <i>HELLO?</i>, I want to know <i>everything</i>. I did understand part of it, but there's still so much I didn't get and only subs can help there. But I guess with the quick release of the 10th episode and this one's suspense and everything, I can expect subs to show up pretty fast ^^;; I'm really really thankful for that XDDD

Well, so I have to get myself ready now, because I have to leave in about 15 minutes O.o.
The kids next-door are throwing fits again. Not a day goes by without them crying their little spoiled hearts out over something amazingly unsignificant <.<
Yes, this is getting on my nerves.
I'll also have to listen to some Arashi songs because I need something happy and an Oh-chan who's alive >.<
Maybe some D no Arashi tonight? Sounds good to me? Perhaps something from the good old Ohmiya team times ^____^

Ja, ittekima~~su ^_^"

"event","I enrolled to university today! YAAAAAAY!!!! ^_____^
Because of this I had to get up at 8 in the morning =.= (which definitely is not an easy thing to do when you've been going to sleep late at night and getting up around noon for the past few months ^^;;).
Now I'm going into planning for next month when lectures start, 'cause I can't not know where to go and what to do, that would make me crazy <-- *inner control-freak just came to life full power ^^;;*

My weekend has been quite exhausting as well, thanks to 24h TV.
I actually wanted to watch the whole thing, but the fact that I was immensly tired and that I knew I had to make it through Sunday <i>and</i> get up early on Monday won over my will to get through with it *pouts*.
But I was at a disadvantage anyway, since it started at 11:30am where I live, so I couldn't exactly sleep long enough to prepare myself for a 24h-watching marathon ^^;;
If I was in Japan, I would have slept all Saturday so I could have stayed up at night and the next day.
The way it was, however, I saw <i>everything</i> of the night programme (<.<), which was pretty much weird except for the random bits of Arashi thrown into it *waking up from lethargy for a few minutes* XDDD, and when it became interesting again in the morning I had to stop _._ 
(Ok, so it was only half past one in the morning my time at that point, but I really <i>was</i> tired! My eyes were crossing every few seconds, that's how tired I was *pouting again* And also, I would have missed the end if I had stayed up longer, 'cause then I would have overslept for sure ^^;;)
So now I'm missing the part from 8:30 - 17:00 (Japanese Time). Thankfully, there are amazing people around who are uploading the whole thing O.O
The time span I'm missing isn't up yet, but at least I know I will be able to watch it. In hindsight it's maybe good that I missed that part and not the one at night, since I might not have downloaded that had I missed it. But I really want to see what happened on the second day, especially the remaining tasks.
I'm glad I at least already got to see Nino's letter ^__^. It was amazing! I didn't understand all that much (but I'm sure somebody will sub it, and probably pretty fast too, so no worries there), but the parts I understood were quite moving T__T
Arashi is amazing. It's one band where Johnny happened to have put together exactly the right people at the right time. The bond they share is impressive. It's something that is not achieved on such a level very often so they can be proud of it and I'm happy for them (if a little envious XDDD) ^_^
I hope next year will be as awesome as this one, especially with their 10th anniversary coming up.
Oh, and am I the only one who thought Oh-chan was adorable? *back to 24h TV* *glomping Ohno* I really hope he will keep his Naruse hair for a while after the drama ends (so soon already T_T). It just suits him so well *sighs* ^^ And his eyes are the most amazingly gentle eyes in this whole damn world (except for when he's Naruse in revenge mood ^^;;)!!!
Btw, Ohno+his art is always a plus (the finished balloon was so cute! ^^)
I'm so looking forward to the last episode of Maou (it's the last, isn't it?...eh...has to look it up ^^;;). I hope that subs for ep.09 are going to be released before ep.10 airs so I fully understand what's going on. Up to this point both Stormy and Sakurai-storm fansubs have been doing a great job. They're both so fast! I really appreciate their hard work o^__^o
<small>And on a sidenote: I think the choice of actors for the younger versions of each character is amazing. They actually look alike (especially young Naruse-who-is-not-Naruse-but-Tomoo...though Chibi!Ohno is still ten times more adorable than that hot guy there XDDD(who didn't look equally as good in the first episode, right? Because his hair was still shorter, it looked a little strange, but the face was already good ^^)). I approve! ^__^ <-- *dork* XDDD</small>

I will go back to watching Last Friends now. I'm already up to ep.05, yay! It's unexpectedly(?) good. I was actually looking forward to it a lot before it started, but then I got an OMG-Sousuke-WTH!!! system overload...<.< Also, I didn't like Ruka very much from both the trailer and that drama SP event with Nakai and whatever other dramas (yes, <i>that</i> event with Ryo doing archery *__*). Then I started watching and I actually like her and...eh...whatshisname...the one with the weird hair, who everyone thinks is gay? That one. ...eh *connecting start&ending of sentence XD*...the best.
But really, Sousuke is creepy! Ryo did a good job there, he's scaring the shit out of me ^^;;

Mata ne~~ *abrupt O.o*

<small>I WILL STUDY JAPANESE STARTING OCTOBER! HOW AMAZING IS THAT?!?!?!?!?!? o^___^o *ecstatic* ...the only downside is the great number of presentations coming up...but I will endure that, yes! *determined* While I'm doing them, they may be bad, but in the end nobody will remember anyway <--last hope T__T ...but, wtf, who cares, I WILL STUDY JAPANESE!!!! *beaming* XDDDD

Don't mind me...'m already leaving ^^;;</small>"

"event","The hamster died tonight.
I went down at 3am and he was still breathing. But I guess it must have been his last breaths, because I heard my mother rummaging around about 15-20 minutes later and she told me today that she went down to see if he was still alive, which he wasn't, and then covered him up and got him out on the balcony so he'd stay cold.
His owners were supposed to come back yesterday. My sister is going over to their house from time to time, but they still haven't returned, it's annoying. We have no idea how they will react when we tell them. And if they don't come back today, we will have to put him into the freezer so he won't start rotting (that sounds so cruel >.<). But we don't want to bury him. It's their hamster and their responsibility. Also, I would like to have the opportunity to say goodbye if it was my hamster.
At least he wasn't in pain. He fell asleep yesterday and the only thing that kept him alive was his heart beating. All we could do was wait and watch and make it as comfortable and easy as possible for him. It was really hard, though. Seeing him die like that. My sister was so sad, as was the rest of us. I was thankful again that the bathroom door can be locked. That bathroom is my shelter ^^;;
But this whole thing makes me fear the day our gerbil dies. I've grown so fond of him that it will be really hard for me to let go.
When my mom called the veterinarian because of the hamster, she (the vet) was surprised to hear that the gerbil is still alive. She was the one who took care of the tumor, but she thought he wouldn't live that much longer because of his age, and here he is, still running around like a madman XDDD
Thank god our guinea pigs are still so young (and get older than just 2 or 3 years).
If I should ever get myself a pet when I'm older, it has to be a dog, or a bird, or something equally long-living, since I'm no good with this whole death thing. Just thinking about it will make me tear up *sighs*.

Change of topic ^^;;
I went swimming today. And yesterday. And the day before yesterday. 1,5km the first two days and 1,2km today. Yaaaaaay me!!!! *poses* ^_^v""
The first two times the weather was bad enough so that the swimming pool was completely empty but good enough to swim.
Today I was kind of surprised, though, because the sun is shining, it's not that cold (at least not when the sun's out), and I went at 3PM, at a time when there are usually lots of people at the pool, especially with the weather being like this, but there was hardly anyone. It was amazing. I love it when the sun reflects in the water, it makes it look so beautiful. It was so much fun o^__^o
The only downside is that I'm limping now. I might have overexerted the muscles at the hollow of my left knee. It's at a part that will also start hurting when I walk long distances (and it's always the same leg). It actually started yesterday already, but I still went swimming today, despite the pain. In the water it wasn't equally as bad, I hardly felt it, but now it's back with full force T_T
Well, at least I didn't get cramps in my fingers when I stepped out of the water this time. And I could walk without my legs wobbling XDDD
It's strange. As long as you're in the water, you don't feel any of this, and then you step out and suddenly it comes crushing down on you. Kind of fascinating...^^;;
I don't know what I did different today, though. Maybe it's the additional 800m that do it...mmh...^^;;

- We're having dinner in about half an hour. I have the feeling that it will be super tasty ^__^
- I finally did the info post.
- I re-watched some Prince of Tennis eps yesterday and will continue today. I love Fuji. He's so cool when he gets mad *__* Today will be the epic Fuji vs. Kirihara match. Before that, however, they have to go to that training camp and meet up with Hyoutei, which means I will be off fangirling Choutarou again o^__^o
I wonder if I'll manage to actually finish the last season this time because there are still about 10 episodes left. I <i>want</i> to finish it, but I also have a problem with endings, they are so...final T_T
This is particularly stupid, though, because there are still the OVAs to watch, so it's not <i>really</i> ending, but still...*sighs*...maybe I should just get through with it. I know I will love them, so there shouldn't be any problem, dammit ^^;;
- Chibi!Ohno is the most adorable thing ever *pinches cheeks* <-- *random*
- I found some shoes! Yaaaay! *happy* They look exactly like the others, only that they're white with black stripes instead of beige with white stripes.
- Because we went to get the shoes at half past 2 on Friday, I missed Maou (which starts at 3) <.<
- I downloaded the 8th episode already (it was out super fast) but will wait for (Sakurai Storm's) subs of the 7th one before I watch it.
- My shampoo has run out, so now I will have to buy a new one *pouts* Unfair...

Posting is quite exhausting. Then again, it might be because I end up writing essays each and every single time -.-;;
I just can't keep it short ^^;;
I'm going to stop now <-- *announcing it again* <.<

OMG...O.O
...
It's amazing. It's...it's...*rendered speechless*
It was even better than expected *__*
Just give me a moment, please *still in the aftershock*...
...
...
OMG!!!!!
OK, so basically all scenes from the previews took place in the first few minutes of the episode XDDD
Nino's appearance was <i>so short</i> O.o, but somehow it was to be expected. Also, they put it close to the end to make Nino-baited people keep watching XP
To be honest, I didn't know a whole lot about the story. Sure, Ohno's that lawyer and Toma that policeman and Ohno wants to revenge his brother's death. But that was already about it.
When Ohno stalked Toma at the beginning I was wondering for a moment if it was him who killed the little brother but then brushed it away as impossible because he's a policeman and all.
I was so shocked when it turned out it really <i>was</i> him O.O
The scene itself was amazing, when they were replaying the murder <small>(though I still don't quite understand how Ohno made that other guy do it...I mean, he can't have been sure that it will really happen, so <i>how did he do it???</i> *confused*)</small>. Toma's expressions were really good and so were Ohno's.
I'm pretty much amazed by this. I want subs. Now! NOW! Onegai!!! m(_ _)m <small>Maa, I think I'll just have to wait patiently, ne? ^^;;</small>
Ohno is so good in that role. It's kind of creepy, actually, to see him play with the people around him that much. That scene when they were interrogating the murderer?!?! Where Ohno sat at that table right next to the person he made commit a murder and <i>right in front of the police</i> and in front of <i>Toma</i>, completely taking in the uproar that he's the cause of O.O WOOAHH!!! O.O
Amazing! A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.!!!!
I want more of this! I want explanations! I want to know how it all evolves! The past that's haunting the both of them, Ohno, who's intent to destroy everything that's dear to Toma to punish him for taking away what was most precious to him! WOOOOOAAAAAHHHH!!!!! *Tension UP!!!!*
I can't wait for next week's episode T___T
Oh-chaaaaaan~~~~~~

<small>Btw, is it sick to drool after him even when he's evil and manipulating like that? ^^;;</small>

And on another note: The soundtrack of this is AWESOME!!!! I need to get my hands on it. The music that plays right at the beginning? And whenever Ohno's up to something in general? SO GOOD!!!! *____*
Arashi's new single to-be, 'truth', is also something I'm looking forward to now. Finally we could listen to it properly without nasty preview noise and I must say, it fits, and I like it a lot ^___^

<small>Sorry for not using Ohno's and Toma's drama names, it somehow sounds weird when I say Ohno's trying to destroy Toma's life, but well XDDD You know what I mean, don't you ^^;;</small>

I will eat something now o^___^o"

"event","<lj-cut text=""This is a cut."">Waaah, I downloaded TVU Player last week but didn't quite get around to actually install it until Monday night, I guess. I never thought it would work this well, though ^^;;
Even though it 'only' has the four main channels (not that I know a thing about Japanese channels, it's just an assumption since they show up fairly often) TBS, Fuji TV, TV Asahi & NTV + some unknown smaller ones, this is already more than I could ever ask for. 

I can finally watch Arashi shows, be ultimately bored by Cartoon KAT-TUN (because, really, this weeks episode was just outright boring...or it didn't get interesting until after I switched channels XDD) and I can watch Dramas, YAAAAAYYY!!!! ^___^
The first thing I saw when I tried it out was the last episode of Zettai Kareshi ^_^
At first I thought it was just a CM for it, but when it just wouldn't stop it dawned to me that it must currently be airing *fails* XDDD
After taking the time difference into consideration, there wasn't even a single doubt that this was indeed on Japanese television <i>just at that moment</i> O.o Sugooooiii!!!!
Being behind 7 hours has the advantage that I can watch all this late-night stuff in the early afternoon and still have time to watch the series that I always do in the evening. ^_^

I'm really looking forward to Maou and Code Blue starting now, because I'm totally gonna watch them right when they are airing *is insanely happy* o^__^o
I'm so excited for Maou, I just hope I won't get disappointed. If there's one thing I learned, it is to never expect too much, because the way down is long >.<
Still, being able to gape at Ohno in suit and with black hair already makes it worth watching XDDD
I love the difference between his evil Maou face and his carefree/spaced-out/<i>adorable</i> face in real life.
And there's gonna be Ohmiya. The backstage photos from one of the magazines yuckie-chan scanned *too lazy to look up the exact title now ^^;;* nearly killed me. Ohmiya holding hands in suits and being just plain cute is definitely more than I can handle. And after all that concert action they gave us *squeals*. Ne? XDDDD
On that holding-hand page it's two completely different Ohno's. It's almost scary how much he looks like a little innocent, happy boy next to (equally young & happy looking) Nino and how different his whole attitude and image is when he's in Maou mode O.o
Kowaaaiii!!!...demo kakkoooiiii!!!! XDDD

On a different note.
I knew that Utaban was going to air today. I thought I might give it a try today, you know, see who's the guest and then either continue to watch or switch channels or do something else entirely.
Then, when TVU Player had finished loading the channel, the first thing that popped into view was Aiba's face. Then Ohno's face. Then the rest of Arashi. Singing One Love.
...
Eh? They're singing a song there today. Cool! *happy*
Then when they finished singing, Nakai introduced them as the guests.
...
EEEEHHH?!?!?!? <--- *finally got it <.<*
They are the guests today?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
LUCKY!!!!! O.o ^___^ o.O ^___^ *insert excessive fangirling and Riida-staring*
It was then that I remembered reading on the official homepage that they were scheduled to be on Utaban one of these days. I just didn't remember the date...and probably thought it would be somewhere in July.
But no, it was actually today! Yatta!!!! ^___^
I loved this Utaban.
As soon as the video is out I'm gonna make screencaps and post them along. Until then, I'll just continue to ramble about it, ne? XDDD
Ohno looked hot. As in, even hotter than usual. The hair, the <i>hair</i> *faints* It does something to his face and his eyes and his everything and renders me speechless and incoherent at the most inappropriate times. I have to admit that I never thought he could do this to me, ever. *bows to the glory named Ohno* *gets smacked by Nino-chan* XDDD
In addition to this he wore this turqoise shirt, but not just simple turqoise but, like, the with the colour fading out? *doesn't know how to explain this* ^^;;
It looked so good on him *___*
And Nakai apologized for all their quarrels (didn't he do that before, once? ^^;;), complete with shaking hands and all. Ohno looked appropriately baffled and unsure what to do about this *huggles Oh-chan*.
Still the other guy (I can't for the life of me remember his name, no matter how many times I write it down >.<) starts whispering stuff into his ear again, causing Ohno to majorly crack up. So adorable!!!! o^___^o

They went on with the usual talk then, with those cardboards where they write news stuff, etc. (I fail at explaining, I know, deal! XDDD)
Did I miss something or did they leave out Aiba and Ohno for this? Mmh...they did, didn't they? ?.?
Anyway, Sho talked about his broken thumb, Nino did some magic card trick and Jun wrote about Hanadan F which Nakai lovingly read as ""Hanaotoko F"" *lol* I love that guy XDDDD

Then they went on to some ranking kind of thing. I took notes, but I due to the blurry quality of the picture I couldn't make out some kanji, thus I have no idea what kind of ranking Nino's and Aiba's was, gomen! Somebody sub this, please! And do it fast! Onegaishimasu! m(_ _)m
Sho's ranking was ""Darashinai Hito"", something like who's the most slovenly/loose/slatternly member (I don't know which of these is the most common word to use, so, yeah? XDD;;;).
The results:
1. Aiba
2. Ohno (not so sure about these first two since I didn't look for a moment, but they talked about Aiba before they went on to the next ranking, so I assume it's this way around *continuing to fail* ^^;;)
3. Matsumoto
4. Sakurai
5. Ninomiya

Ohno's ranking: ""Nazo ga ooi hito"" --> The member who's most puzzling (or something along the lines)
The results:
1. Ninomiya (yay, Nino XDDD)
2. Matsumoto
3. Sakurai
4. Aiba
5. Ohno (well, of course Ohno would be able to figure himself out, but what about us? It's not that easy for us, isn't it? ^^;;)

Matsujun's ranking: ""Ungawarui hito"" --> The most unlucky member
The results:
1. Sakurai (now, where does he get that image from XDDD *pats Sho*
2. Ninomiya
3. Ohno
4. Aiba
5. Matsumoto (...brat...XDDD)

After the ranking they did some game. In the first round everyone had to eat something, though one of whatever it was had spicy stuff in it. The loser was to get a punishment.
Considering the result of this, Aiba should have been on a higher position in Jun's ranking XDDD Poor boy. Can't handle spicy things, can he? But his pained face is kind of cute XDDD
As it turned out, the punishment had to be carried out by all members (why do it in the first place then? XDDD).
They did their A.RA.SHI again and had to repeat it until Nakai was satisfied and their movements exaggerated enough. ^^
In the second round they had to take up binoculars and see through them. Apparently one of them had black paint on it, but they all got through safe. Nakai got the black eye instead and had to do an impersonation XDDD

After this was over, it switched to the other group that was scheduled to be on without a warning O.O. Honestly, the cutting of Japanese shows is so random!!! Even with commercials. All of a sudden they're there, then gone again, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, it's <i>SO RANDOM</i>. 
Waah, I really want the video now. Maybe it's even out already? *needs to check*
I want to do screencaps~~~ ^___^

Mah, need to go downstairs now <.<
Don't wanna >.<

Mata ne~~~ o^___^o

<small>I'm sure that when I proofread that later, there will be tons of mistakes and weird logic and all -.-;;
Well, whatever it is, I'll have to do it later ^^;;</small>

"event","Majorly pissed off gets a bit closer to what I'm feeling right now and it's getting worse by the minute.
Why?
Because some unfortunately unknown (well, fortunate for <i>them</i>) asshole kids have completely ruined my bike. 
Don't think this is something to get so upset about? Well, fuck off, because I'm not in the mood to have some people who don't know me tell me what I should think about this!
I'm not a rich person and definitely can't afford a new bike right now when I'm already struggling to earn enough money for me to be able to go to university <i>and</i> pay my part of the house rent, thank you!
And what's worse about nobody seeing it, is that no one will ever pay for this and those bastards can just go on live their destructive, careless, useless, shitty live without ever having to waste a second thought on it because no one will ever find out! This sucks so much it's not even funny anymore. Well, <i>they</i> probably thought it was really funny *twitches*.
If I could, I would hunt them down and make them get me a new bike <i>NOW</i>.
Woah, I want to punch something really badly! Thank god my pillows are Do-M and able to take it without being fucked up too.
Plus the neighbour's children have been wailing and crying ALL MORNING!!! Ever since they moved in my nerves haven't been the best because those kids are crying and complaining 80% of the time. And  for some reason the parents and the grandparents (when they're there to look after the children while the parents are at work) don't even think about taking the children <i>inside</i> until they've stopped throwing a fit but let the whole neighbourhood take part in their misery. I have stopped counting how many times exactly I have been woken up by this, during the week and on weekends. But, well, who needs to sleep anyway?!?
<i>And</i> I still have to write an e-mail back to my father who loves to use sarcasm to get his point across far too much than is good for him and behaves like a loser boy in puberty, wth?!?
I have no idea what to write back that is not outright insulting and will destroy whatever relationship we still have forever.
Life's such a bitch and I hate her for loving it so much. Go fuck up somebody else's life!

"event","<lj-cut text=""cut for length ^^"">Oh my god, I finally managed to ask my mother for permission to order KAT-TUN's Real Face Con DVD and *insert strange name* CD (the version with bonus CD, of course ^__^ (JIIIIIIN~~~~ *desperate* ^^;;)).
I could tell that she wasn't happy about me ordering something again (especially something that expensive >.<). The timing couldn't be worse, I know. We're currently moving and that costs a <i>hell</i> lot of money, I tell you -.-;;
So I can actually understand why she's close to killing me when I come at that point of time to spend even more money! But, well, it's my money, so I can do what I want with it...and even though she's paying it now, she'll get it back, so...ne? >.<
I kind of feel bad about it, though...but I wanted them so much!!! T___T And it's not my fault that they're releasing all that stuff <i>now</i>, isn't it?!? *pouts*

*sighs*

I really have to start searching for a job for summer holidays. If I proceed to lurk around at home during my free time any longer, they're really going to kill me >>.<<
And I could need some money badly. If my school wasn't from around noon until in the evening I could do some part-time work, but the way it is now...it would be too much. I need some time to do my homework after all, and at the moment that time's in the morning.

I also just remembered that I still need to choose my two topics for the oral exams, one of which I will have to present in the end. We're supposed to have them by 9th May, one on the UK and one on the USA...and I don't have a clue what to choose <.<;;
*fails when it comes to anything concerning spontaneity and/or creativity* -.-;;

Oh, and another thing: I MISS JIN LIKE <i>HELL</i>!!! T____T
I'm still not over all those random jokes people made, be it 'cause of April Fool's or due to some stupid <i>bet</i>!!! >.<
Those really killed me. And I can't understand why everyone keeps saying 'You win!', 'That's so funny!', etc. because it's <i>not</i>! T___T
I'm usually open for all kinds of jokes, no matter what they are like, but this is just...just...really mean...I could tolerate the April Fool's one because it's the day's fault and I should have expected something like this, but the second one...no, no, <i>no</i>, can't tolerate this one at all...my poor nerves...T___T

Just had to get this off my mind >.<

What else, what else...once we have fully moved - what will be by the end of next week - I won't have internet until 4th May T.T
That will be horrible. Well, the ones moving into the flat we're currently still living in won't move in until at the beginning of May so we'll leave one computer in there until then so we will at least have internet there. Otherwise I will have to use the school computers (though I don't like them, so annoying ^^;;).
But I'm already making provisions, so to speak. Yes, I know, I will be busy with school again, but I have lots, and I mean <i>lots</i> of stuff to watch during my free time, Jdramas, shows, etc, etc ^___^
Maybe I'll finally manage to finish watching Anego. I got stuck right after episode 4. But as stupid as I am, I can't manage to watch something that has Jin in it that much at the moment. 'tis about time they release something official about his return. Even if it would take longer than expected (what I don't hope), it would at least be clear then *sighs*. And I really want to watch it, so it's even more stupid -.-;;

'think I will dl some more now...and read all those fanfictions that are still on my list, waiting to be read ^^;;
I feel horribly lazy at the moment...been running around too much these past days ^^
At the same time there's lots of things I want to do, that I can't because all the stuff I need is already in my new room -.-;;
Empty rooms are boring...

<lj-cut text=""Cut immediately because of length, so...click to read? ^__^"">Ah, yatta, I managed to write another fanfic and it had the exact effect I wanted it to have: I'm all genki again ^__^
Somehow this works out almost every time. Whenever I'm depressed I just have to write it all out and then I feel better in an instant. Though, as this switch of my mood can happen very quickly, I can never make longer stories out of it.
But that's not so bad, ne? Let's go for crack instead of death! ^__^;;

My first term is almost at its end. Next week will be the last exams and than I can hopefully proceed to the second semester. But that shouldn't really be a problem as I have quite good marks ^^;;
I just hope that the texts in the exams are not too difficult and don't contain too much unknown vocabulary...^^
I'm curious what the class will be like in the next semester. If all manage to pass the exam and what new students might come in *nervous* ^^;;

Yamapi's CD arrived about 1 1/2 weeks after my last entry. I totally love the cover! And the pictures in the booklet are like O.O...XD~~~~ *drools*
I just can't get enough of his voice. ^__^

Currently, I'm waiting for Aoyagi Ruito's RokkakuMyu photoset to arrive. I'm so excited! :3
This will be my first item of the Tenimyu musicals that I own. I mean, I have the Boys Love DVD but that is just Tenimyu actors and not Tenimyu itself, ne? ^^
I had a tough time deciding whether to choose Ruito's or Date's photoset but in the end I had to choose Rui's because his photos of this shoot are just so droolworthy, I swear!!! (And there was this fanfiction someone wrote that involved the photos and I loved that one (and the photos^^) so, for me, that's enough of a reason to get this)^^

My passion for KAT-TUN still hasn't faded. In fact, it's growing every day ^^
I'm counting the days until Jin returns (though counting would be easer if I knew the exact date of his return...-.-;;)
I'm totally in writing mood at the moment. There are a lot of spontaneous ideas that seem to flow out of my mind and onto the paper. Though, the genre of the fics highly depend on my mood during the writing and idea-having process. That's also why the above-mentioned one turned out so angsty^^;; and the last one so cracky ^__^. Though I end up writing crack more than I do with angst. Even if I don't want to write crack, it often just turns out as that ^^;;
I just dl-ed several Hadaka no Shounen episodes from 2001 and 2002 and, damn!, they are all so young there! I really have mixed feelings when I see (especially) Kame and Jin being so young and happy there. They sure went through a lot of things after that and they have grown older. Time, debuting and all that has cost them a lot of their innocence. You could say that it's a good thing to lose innocence when you grow up but I miss the carefree smiles and attitudes that they had back then. 
But I guess that's an inevitable process. I don't like it at all...>.<

I also finally started watching Anego. And I have to say...OMG!!!!!! This is so good!!!!! *hugs puppy-eyes Jin*
Woahh, that kiss! When he walked up on her and just did it that went, like, straight into areas that I don't have because I'm a woman (XDDD) *drools* That lucky woman...I would pay everything to be kissed by Jin like that ^___^
And then sleeping!Jin later on when they wake up together in bed ^_______^
And I only watched the first four episodes O.o...there's still No.5-10 to go PLUS the Special (waaah, so much T__T...^___^)
I definitely have to continue watching!
But there's also the last three PoT seasons that need to be watched. Time!!! I need TIME!!!!!

Omg, I started writing this entry this afternoon at 3pm....then my friend called and made me stay on the phone for more than one hour. Then I had to babysit my little sister (^__^)...and then I called my friend again....and we talked on the phone for three hours ^^;;;;;
So, ehm...yes? I actually had to listen to a new CD after that and now it's *checks clock*...oh...1:08am...XDDD
It's a miracle that I didn't accidently close the entry page (as I always manage to do <i>while</i> writing entries and it's freaking me out because, damn, one can only be stupid like that once, right? Right???...Wrong. I stopped counting. It seems my elbow loves my keyboard and maybe they'll marry and have lots of children in the future, I don't know...like they would ask me anyways <.<

Tomorrow (actually, it's today as it's already past midnight^^;;) I'll be going to a concert of a German band. It was a present for my birthday...and somehow I wish I had told them that I want something else as a present. I mean, it's not that I actually hate the kind of the music they make but I don't really love it either.
What worries me most about it, though, is that I'm not a person who likes being around people. I feel uncomfortable. I prefer staying in private. And I'm not very much into dancing. So, basically, what I fear is that, tomorrow, I'll be the one person that will be totally underdressed, standing in the middle of a crowd of people who are all bouncing and shouting and sincing like crazy because they are fans of the band (what I am <i>not</i>), looking bored (because I am) and stupid.
It's always like that. I just like listening to the music. Why move like crazy? Maybe I could do that when I really, really like something and have someone as crazy as me with me that I can be crazy with? (o.O?)
I will be glad when that's over, really...

But what I'm really looking forward to February 22. On that day, my friend and me will go to see the show of comedian Mario Barth (the one I said I would buy tickets for in one of my earlier posts). I can't wait for that. It will definitely be awesome because he's so damn funny XDDDDDD
So, like that, I will maybe be able to forget tomorrow very quickly...it'll be so embarrassing >.<

Ne, I think I will listen to my new CD a bit more. It's so good! p^_^q

Mah, there's still some things that I have to dl (and also some stuff that I'll have to ul *sigh* how troublesome). Where to take the time from for that?

I'm finally updating again!
I think I'm a bit careless when it comes to that ^^;;
Also I've been too lazy to reply to any comments recently made, so I will do that as soon as I finished this entry ^___^

Honestly, I think my entries suck. They're so boring...<<
But if you're not doing anything exciting nothing better will come out of it, ne? ^.^;;

Studying still isn't stressful at all. Some of my classmates may think it is but if they had attended the school I was in before they would most likely feel more the way I do. ^^
Last week was a bit annoying, though, as I had to learn for two exams in subjects that you can't help but learn for =.=. I don't know how the results will be, though, so I guess I'll just have to wait....but it could be that at least one of the two marks will not be that good -.-;;

It finally is December again! Everyone starts decorating their windows and gardens and it is really beautiful! Even the main hall of the town's station has a whole bunch of ornaments now and every time I walk through it when going to school I feel really good o^_^o.
That's what I really like about winter. I don't like it getting cold and all but when Christmas comes around everything lights up just a little bit, ne? ^___^
What's bad, though, is that I have to start looking for presents now. I'm so not creative >.<
But I will get presents too, ne? ^___^
I already told my mother that I need a bigger hard-drive as my current one is way too small and a pain to my ass...I'm really looking forward to having a lot of space to store all my videos and music *____* *spaces off*

What else? Mmh, I recently got into KAT-TUN. They are so awesome and their music is really good and...and...WAAAAAHHHH!!!! They're like that, ne? ^___^
And although I've only known them for about a week now, I already want Jin to come back ^^;;

And I was finally able to rip the title song from the movie 'Legend of Gingko'! I've been searching for it ever since I first heard it but it was nowhere to be found T___T.
But now, thanks to my utter brilliance (<.<), I finally own it. It's so beautiful! *___*
In case anybody wants to listen to it as well, here are some links (I uploaded to post them in another place but thought I might share the links here as well...I mean...just uploading to post them in my journal would be kind of...senseless? There's almost nobody here anyways ^^;;):

http://www.megaupload.com/?d=P5RC9USB
http://www.sendspace.com/file/2qfpos

Want the main theme as well? Here you are ^___^:

http://www.megaupload.com/?d=Y549J61Y
http://www.sendspace.com/file/uyjqjx

I really like that movie a lot and the entire score is so awesome!


Nya, nya, so another entry comes to an end...^___^
I had actually already written it about an hour ago but just when I had finished and wanted to see the preview, my elbow slipped from my desk onto my keyboard and hit the lucky button called 'enter' <.<
In my panic I stopped the process but was too slow and it already started loading the next page which means that everything I had written was gone...Then I realised that what I did was stupid in two ways: firstly, the entry was finished, it even had a header, I had written what kind of music I was hearing, my mood and the icon were all selected, it was <i>finished</i>! Thus, it could have been posted without worries <.<...secondly, even if I hadn't finished it yet, I could have just edited the post or copied everything I've written, delete the too-early post and do the entry again...but stupid me stops that damn process in the worst moment ever....I got so mad that I had to leave my computer alone for a while and went taking a shower ^^;;...that kind of cooled me down a bit (well, it heated me up, actually^^) so I was able to try writing all of this <i>again</i>. It's not entirely the same as the original entry, but most of the parts I wanted in it I could recall from my memory, so here you are! ^^;;

Mah, boredom is horrible, isn't it? >.<

I should be learning the vocab for the test on thursday but...I probably won't be starting until tuesday ^^;; <-- lazy me, ne?

Plus, I have a number of FFs that I want to finish but whenever I think I could continue writing I find something else that keeps me away from it -.-;;
And in the end I realize that what I've been doing instead was completely pointless and I would have been better off if I'd written as I'd originally planned it. T_T
That's stupid, huh?

Tomorrow I'm going to buy a ticket for the show of a german comedian named Mario Barth (he's really funny ^___^). Or, at least, I hope so (not that he's funny, but that I'm getting the ticket^^;;). The show will take place in the end of February 2007^^ (believe it or not but all the shows before that are sold-out^^).
I'll have to take the train one hour earlier than the usual to meet up with the friend that I'm going to watch the show with....and afterwards I will have to go to school...<.< 

*sigh*

Booooooooooriiiiiiiing!!!!!!

I want to play tennis. Somehow.
I played once when I was 12 or 13 years old, for about three years. I had to stop because it got too expensive (and they wanted me to start going to competitions...and as I still have a trauma concerning that from my ballet times I gratefully accepted the price as a suitable reason to stop T_T...am I pathetic, or what?).
But lately I really want to do it again. And it didn't really help to find the Prince of Tennis Anime and the Musicals and Cinepuri that aaaaallll involve tennis and have left me desperate....I want to plaaaayyyy!!!!
I have to find one of the tennis rackets that we still have somewhere. Like that I could at least hold a racket in my hands...and, yes, I <i>am that</i> desperate!!! ^___^

I'll probably be shutting down the computer now. Maybe I can force myself to write if I do  that...if not...well, I'll find something to distract me, for sure ^^;;

Mata ne
*still bored* T____T (...somebody...entertain me!!!!)

Just wanted to post this.
I read a post somebody else made in a community that I'm too lazy to look up right now (XD), that listed KamaDate Themes. As it happens, I'm in a very creative mood right now (and can't even BE creative 'cause I have to go <.<) and thought of some themes myself.

I don't want to lose them, so I'll post them here ^^ (under a cut because of length).

"event","Hehe, I watched the Imperial Match in Winter on YouTube until 3:00 am and added it to my personal favorites.
Now I'm trying to find the song 'Ikkiuchi' everywhere but since it's only on the soundtrack of HyouteiMyu in Winter I'm searching in vain. -.-""""

BUT. Because I know now what happens I can finally watch the 'Imperial Match' in the Anime.
Yay!!!
And I want to see the match between Fuji and Jirou again (Jirou's so funny ^.^).
And I want to see the match between Echizen and Hiyoshi. Haaah *sighs*^^

So, no interruptions for the next few hours ^____^
I'm off.

Ja ^^"

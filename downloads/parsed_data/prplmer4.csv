"event","Tomorrow is my first day at Loudoun County.  Tomorrow is the big ""welcome to Loudoun County"" day of festivities to make all of us new hires to feel proud and welcomed to the school district.  Following that I have two and a half days of new hire professional development at my high school then the rest of the faculty comes back and thus the real school year begins.  Last year I was scared of school starting.  I was scared of what was to come and a lot did come.  When I was involuntarily transferred to Ballou I had no feelings.  I just didn't care but when I was hired at Loudoun County I was sad to leave Ballou.  Ballou defined me as a teacher and made me realize that I am a good teacher and shouldn't feel bad about the transfer.  The transfer was the best thing that happened to me.  It was what led me to Loudoun and to the awesome position that I now have.  Not all first year teachers get to teach AP classes and I do.  The people that I met at Ballou have influenced me and have helped me tremendously in my fight with DCPS.  My friendship with the Union Representative gave me an insight into what was wrong with DC and how to fight back DCPS.  I hate DCPS with a passion.  If they were not so bad I would still be at Ballou leading the social studies department in the ninth grade academy (which they selected me for and I interviewed the other teachers to be included in the academy and all the while I was leaving....) but now I am back at the bottom starting over.  

This time it is different.  I am at a school that wants me and sees my potential.  I know I will not be involunarily transfered and I can put my name on stuff!  I can put my name on my teacher's book and my materials.  I even get materials.  Real teaching materials!  This point last year I bought around 300.00 worth of stuff for the school year, this year, only 20.00 and this was for art supplies for myself and binders.  I can't wait for the school year to start.  I can't wait to use power point and the overhead projector and I am especially excited about slide shows using pictures that I have collected on different parks and museums.  The kids will see me as a dork.  That is alright.  I have accepted it.  

Housewarming Party Saturday.  If you are cool you received your evite invitation...see you on Saturday!"

"event","After finishing my slice of pizza and settling in to a relaxing night with my mom in my apartment, I heard drips and I looked around and saw that the fire alarm had water leaking out of it.  I put a pan underneath it and it filled almost immediately.  I called the Cloisters Maintenance hotline and no one answered.  I went upstairs to R-34 and they didn't have any water in their apartment.  Back to my apartment to the fire alarm still leaking water and now the fire alarm was going off.  I called the maintaince hotline again and no answer.  My mother began packing her bags to go stay at my new townhouse and I went looking for the maintenance men down the road.  I found them, they came half an hour later and the fiance had already left the new townhouse in order to come over and see if he can help.  The maintenance guy came, ripped (literally) the fire alarm out of the ceiling, informed me that R-34 hot water tank had ruptured in the floor between our two apartments and that the water will still be coming out for awhile and not to worry.  He would be coming back tomorrow to install a brand new fire alarm.  I am so glad that I am moving out.  This tonight reminded me why I am leaving my apartment and going to a new townhouse.  I can't wait to move.  I will miss this apartment.  It has so many memories of my new life in DC.  This is where I met new friends, had grand adventures and parties and of course where my relationship with my fiance began and expanded into a great relationship.  Sue, DC is going to be awesome for you!"

"event","I hate the District of Columbia Public Schools system.  I love where I teach now but I hate the school system.  Not only are they closing or consolidating 30 schools, they are reorganizing Ballou where I work.  I knew that something would happen with my job again after being transferred so I have already job searched and have been hired by a VA school district.  (Of course no one knows this in DC except for Ms. Iverson and Madame Roberson just in case the job in VA doesn't go through!)  The VA school district is helping me get my VA license and I have all my required documents but I need one thing from DCPS.  Today I left school early, took my students to Ms. Iverson's room to finish their projects and drove up to Union Station to park my car in the horrible expensive parking garage.  I proceeded to walk to 825 North Capitol Street NW and made it to the 6th floor HR office.  I encountered the receptionist who was on the phone when I got there and was on the phone the whole time I was talking with her.  I told her I needed a form signed by HR to say that I was indeed a DCPS employee.  She told me to leave the form with her and she would see it to the respective department and then they would send it back to me.  Now, you don't leave anything with HR.  It is like an abyss down there.  You leave something for your personal file and POOF! It vanishes!  You leave something to be signed and POOF! that has vanished.  I told the receptionist that I have no intentions of leaving anything with her because I would never get it.  She told me that the person in Verification was horribly busy today.  She was processing 14,000 applicants information alone.  I told her that I would wait until closing time and have her sign the form because this needs to be done today.  The receptionists then said that I should come back.  I asked her when, she said tomorrow, thursday maybe even as early as friday.  She was not sure when the one lady in verification would be done.  I then looked at her and said, ""Why would I expect to get any customer service here?  There is always a problem down here and no body here seems to be able to help anyone.""  I turned and left.  The receptionist started up her telephone conversation again.  It seems that now that I want to leave DCPS they are making it impossible.  To stay would be even more impossible.  This whole district sucks.  I feel so bad for the students here.  No one cares about them.  On a side note, the HR division is undergoing massive lay-offs and they are implementing an automated HR phone service.  I have a feeling that it won't be any more effective than the idiots they have working down there currently."

"event","It is the strangest thing for me to be engaged.  I was certain that I would be 30 and still single.  I would be the one going alone to the weddings or having that burden of finding someone to go with.  I am now the person that is getting married first and will never have to worry about finding a date or going alone.  Last night we talked about wedding plans and details and he admitted to me that he also thought he would be single at 30.  What happened we wondered and then realized that some things in life you can't control.  If he did go to grad school at William and Mary we would have never met.  If I didn't come to DC we would never have met.  But somehow we did met and now we are getting married in about a ton of months.  There is so much to being engaged and it wasn't until sunday night at the Grog that I realized that I was getting married.  The Grog was an Engagement Get-Together which also had one of our friends playing for the night.  When he called us to the front of the bar and had us stand right there next to him and announced that we were engaged and our wedding date was..... and then my baby kissed me and everyone clapped.  We are getting married and now all the planning and hair pulling can begin.  It is also very strange to be introduced as his fiance.  I visited his workplace yesterday and met the clan he works with and then he said, ""...this is my fiance, Liz.""  Just sounds so weird.  Back to enjoying my Spring Break!"

"event","I always knew that DCPS was in pretty bad shape with its administration and the way the HR department does business.  I knew that Ms. Clara Bowers who had the classroom space next to me would bring me bad luck.  For what I already knew I shouldn't have been that surprised that when returning from Pittsburgh (after dealing with the death of my uncle and all the problems that he left behind and spending a week on bereavement leave) I got my mail and found a letter saying that I had been transfered and that my new school starting date was today (this was saturday).  Before I left for Pittsburgh, Ms. Clara Bowers was transfered to Ballou but she was fighting with the Union over it saying it wasn't right and such.  On a side note:  Ms. Bowers is the worst teacher there is.  She does nothing in class but talk on her cell phone and yell at the kids, do you think I am stupid I hear what you are doing over there! and then she comes and does a buffet line in my classroom taking my ideas, handouts, etc and she does this for all the teachers that teach the same subject as her.  Shaw (my former school now) has been trying to get rid of her for over a year and a half now but she always stays because the Union fights for her.  So the Union fought for her again and let her stay at Shaw and had me leave without telling me.  Being transfered is horrible.  My students are upset and the whole order in the 8th grade house is over.  Ms. Bowers will be teaching all the students now and well there is going to be a lot of 8th graders that know nothing about US History and DC History.  The funny thing is, the school that I was transfered to is the worst school in the district with every problem you can think of.  With my visit today I am only going to be teaching three classes.  One Street Law which I only supervise because Georgetown Law students come in and teach that and two US History classes that contain 11th and 12th graders.  My schedule is easy and the students thus far are not that bad at all.  The 11th and 12th graders are students that want to be there and want to learn.  Ms. Bowers really did herself in this time.  This school would have been perfect for her but alas she stayed at Shaw and effective friday, the 8th grade history position will be cut due to lack of budget.  For some reason I am so happy about that because when a position is cut, you don't get a transfer but a red slip.  Justice does come through somehow.  Now I wait while applying to VA schools because I will be living there in due time....."

I moved here for my job at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with no expectations at all and that all changed by the end of September.  I loved my job and everyone that I worked with.  DC is fantastic for doing just about anything and I have done tons!  Having wednesday and thursday off are not fun but they have turned out to be not so bad.  No one shops on wed and thurs and there is never a line for any sort of business transaction that needs to be completed.  Going out on tues/wed night is great in the fact that you have the bar to yourself and the drinks are always cheap!  Good thing the Holocaust job was not one that required much thought after learning all the tours or the weekends would have been disastrous with all of us dragging in after our nights out together.  The people I have met here are awesome and I don't know what I would do if I didn't met them.  My roommate is the best I have ever have and she loves baseball which only means we have been to everyone home game possible.  Doesn't help much that she gets free season tickets from her boss at work.  I did get to attend inauguration and I didn't care that Bush was still in office but it was awesome to be there for that moment when the president (whoever it is) takes that oath.  The only real celebrity I have met is Jenna Bush and I gave her the tour of the museum so that was cool but the school group she brought with her was not so much.  This past spring brought much change.  I found my history geek in January at work and still love seeing him each day and going to all the museums and events together, he is just the perfect thing that DC has given me.  I also have found a new job here in DC.  I am now an 8th grade teacher of US History at Shaw JHS.  I have changed my license to DC and my car registration.  I now officially live in DC and probably will for a long time.  My life has changed dramatically since moving here and I love every minute of it!"

It is so weird when you are getting ready in your own apartment with your mother in the bathroom washing up and your father in the kitchen washing his face.

Well my dad has the souvenir now but that is still pretty interesting.  All in all, I felt like a true adult.  When your parents stay the night at your place and you give them break and strawberries for home, that is adult.  I love my parents and I love spending time with them all the time now.

"event","Finally home from another weekend in NYC.  Had tons of fun and was introduced to sushi, The Donkey Show, ""water"", a new term for condiments and Toxic Audio.  I enjoyed everything and relaxed.  Learn some things this weekend about myself that I really need to take ahold off.  Even if a person doesn't know you that well, I believe some things can be taken to heart.  It takes someone on the outside to identify things that I repress on the inside.  Another week of packing but no flying which relieves me.  Driving on the thruway never sounded so good after my E train experience with my big, heavy bag.  I miss Lauren and Megan this weekend so much.  I haven't spent nearly enough time with then as I should and I just started realizing how great they are and I will miss then whenever and wherever my life takes me.  Time for bed and sleep.  Just good ol' uninterrupted sleep in my own not-so-green-Kermit-like bed."

I want one weekend with no packing and no going some other place.  I just want to stay in Buffalo and hang out all day and not even shower and watch TV and eat horrible food that I bought at City Grocery.

"event","This weekend was fun.  Received my new vehicle, a mercury mountaineer and had to give up my ford escort zx2 which is very sad.  I saw some old friends and school friends who I have not seen in awhile.  I went to a father's day car show with my father today and was a judge for the car show.  That was so exciting!  Being able to judge people's interior and if they were mean or looking over my shoulder, I marked them down.  So mean but well worth it.  This is this boy that ever since I was like in 6th grade has liked me.  Every year at this car show he follows me and talks to my father about me but never talks to me.  Very odd.  This year I approached him and made some small talk to be the only one talking.  So odd.  He has gotten better looking through the years but this whole conversation thing and still not talking to me after like 10 years is a little odd.  He is about three to four years older than me so a 26 to 27 year old is still having trouble making small talk with me and I have known him for awhile.  My dad loves the boy and he does have good 'paper' qualities.  Has a good job, owns a classic car and knows how to drive a car rough and how to do burnouts.  Very big items in my book.  His parents are also very interested in me and wanting me to be around.  I think they see marriage bells and I saw no future with him.  It is nice to be liked and have someone watch you and follow you (in a nonstalking type of way) around and know that he likes you so much that he is intimidated by you.  This is not something that I encounter frequently so I must bask in the glory of it now.  Although, if any of you saw this person, my basking in the glory might not be so glorious anymore...."

I did end up with some really great books and I can't wait to use them.  I am starting at Teddy Roosevelt tomorrow and need to really go over my tour but I am going to write up some note cards real quick for the things that I am having trouble remembering.  Tonight is low key and will be viewing The Stepford Wives.  I wanted to see this movie and I am excited about it.  I am going home for the weekend and can't wait.  I am going to Canal Fest with the girls from women's rights and we always have fun at these things.  I hope it doesn't rain because I really want to see the fireworks.  Every other year it has rained and I hope it doesn't this year.  Today is a sad day, one month ago my grandma died.  I still can't believe that she died.  I never thought it would happen and I still can't comprehend it.  I still think I have to see her at the nursing home and I still collect all these little things for her and then remember that she is not here anymore.  I found a letter from her the other night and it made me so sad.  I miss my grandma so much and I am going to miss her for all the big things that I have to experience in my life.  I still can't bring myself to take down all my sympathy cards.  I really don't want to forget what happened and wish that I had more time with her even though I had a lot of time and memories with her.  I still can't believe that God let her suffer as much as He did.  It makes me so mad to think that God would let something like that happen but my mother told me that those that believe the truest are the one that suffer and did she suffer.  I will be visiting her grave this weekend with my dad and hopefully the flowers are still pretty."

It is so scary to know that this is my last summer in Buffalo and I have no idea where I am going to end up.  Tonight I got mad though, for the first time in my life I said what I felt and I got yelled at.  We were at McMonkees and I was talking to this guy who is a school counselor.  We were really hitting it off (in a good conversation way) and I was impressed by his politeness and sensibility on so many things.  All of a sudden, the girls that I was with, Lauren, Liz and Britany wanted to leave and they wanted to leave NOW.  No questions asked.  So I left, they are my ride, as we walked downstairs, they found people they knew and one hour later, we left.  I was so mad.  I put up with them talking and kissing and making out with these boys they knew and I couldn't even have one conversation with this boy that I had a common interest in?  Why do I have to give up my time to let them do their thing.  I told Lauren this when she asked me why I was upset and she got mad saying that I should go upstairs and come down when I was ready when I know that would piss them off even more.  I hate that I am so nice and can't think of myself for once.  I hate that I am just a carpet that so many people just walk over.  I have feelings and I have a selfish part to me but I am so scared that people will get mad at me that I do what they want to do.  I told Lauren all of this and she understood but her friends were definetely not buying it.  They said he wasn't cute and I shouldn't have been talking to him anyways.  I could have told them about their boys all night but I knew as they were sucking face with them that that would hurt them but they can tell me that so that can go get Jim's Steakout and leave cause their boys were gone?  Not very happy right now but didn't see my ex so that is a good, actually excellent.  I heard from Megan though that Mike is trying to see Keri and she wants to see him.  I told Megan to tell Keri that they should both go for it.  Finally they can get it on without cheating on me, they have my blessing and I wish the best for them, the unemployed casino worker and the neurotic female."

I hate how he thinks and acts as though he knows everything....believe me, he doesn't.  There is rumor that he lost his job but I don't know and that would only consist of me having to call and find out but by calling I open up another two week window of him calling me, which I don't want.  I know someone I will run into him tonight and I am dreading it thoroughly.  He thinks he is all that and cool and well he isn't.  I don't know what I saw in him two years ago at all.  I don't like the person that I am around him and I don't like him at all.  Two weeks ago he wrote me this sticky note of how much he loves me and wants me in his life.  He is a funny way of showing it by putting me down and saying that I have gained weight.  Well, I don't think he has looked into the mirror lately cause he is not a thin boy anymore.  He is huge if you ask me and he doesn't carry his weight well at all.  I don't want to see him, talk to him or even run into him tonight.  Even though I know he won't have any money and will try to bum off of me or his two idiotic friends who one I hate so much I don't want to see his face again.  Enough venting."

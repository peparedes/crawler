"event","All day I've been anxious. Not in a commonly used meaning of the word, but in a DSM definition of anxiety, anxious. I blamed my state of mind&nbsp;on cramps and bloating, hence high irritability. Which was probably the case. Nick hasn't called since yesterday morning. I'm in no way complaining, some wives have only gotten a few calls the whole time they've been gone. But his calls wake me up every day and keep me going. At times they wake me up at 4 am or 11pm, but it doesn't matter, havn't been sleeping much anyway. I remember not sleeping much in high school and being very productive. I wrote. Crap, but at least I wrote. Now I just lay there waiting for it to be April. Anyway, the day wasn't getting any better. And then I got a call from my KV. There has been a casualty and three injuries, and that's why the guys havnt been able to contact home. I wish I knew who it was. I called a few of my friends to make sure their husbands were alright. This is devastating. Injuries scare me, but a casualty... This sucks. A lot. But, as much as I hate to say it, I think we've all being waiting for it. Waiting in a sence of expecting and dreading, not anticipating wantingly.&nbsp;
I called Stella. My voice was shaky and I know I should've waited to get a grip before I called; she hasn't been dealing with this whole thing too well. So she cried and asked me why they are there. Why we have to go through this for no good reason. I don't think she expected a response and I definitely didn't have one. I'm scared. And almost equally pissed off. I don't know if it's their defence mechanisms for not knowing how to respond to an unfamiliar situation or just plain 'who gives a fuck it's not my life' attitude, but friends are turning out to not be so. People who claim to care, who have known us for years haven't asked me how I'm doing, but more importantly how Nick is.&nbsp;I'm not talking about those who generally don't call and we've lost contact with, but close friends or those I see every day. Whatever. This is a rant and I sure hope no one's reading this. Midterms are coming up and I know nothing. Reading needs to happen sometime very soon, and a lot of it."

I can't remember who exactly told me this particular story. I've heard so many. Some of these women are nasty scanks, yet others are the most amazing people in the world. They are brave, strong and always willing to give a hand if ever needed. 
I'm in 29 Palms for the weekend, finally getting rid of the house. Gov-t housing - never again. Foma and I are staying with Peck and Emily (my high school friend and his wonderful wife). They are gone for a day to Disenyland to celebrate both of their birthdays. 
When I lived here I met Brenda, she's married to an artillery marine here. They are a bit older, she's got two kids, 11 and 13. She's half Japanese and has two dpggies. I saw her today at the PX and she invitd us to dinner. Home cooked Japanese food tonight. I'm excited. It's pretty amazing how close you can be to people you've barely met. Brenda's husband also just deployed to join 3/4 in Al Qaim (Nick's unit). 
Being here 29 is harder than I thought it would be. All the little things remind me of being with my hunny. Like when he gets out of the shower and gets the whole house wet, walks around in his big blue robe like he owns the world. He's the cutest. And I miss him."

I dont at all mind the magnets themselves, in fact we have one on out car that calls you to support our marines. But people!

"event","At least I know I'm not all dandy. Emotional instability, compulsive skin picking, things fitting into compartments and freaking out about details... Like that's not enough, mild anxiety attacks have to be added to the picture. In social today, my hands started shaking uncontrollably. The harder I tried to keep writing, the worse it got. Now I'm getting all itchy... I seem to fall into patterns, and if a pattern is broken, feel great discomfort. I can't be alone. I'm dreading going to Fremont tomorrow. I look like shit. I hate going to Fremont when I look like shit. My parents seem to get a kick out of pointing it out to me. ""Have you been picking your skin?"" Umm, no ass, I got attacked by a swarm of flesh-eating bugs. I keep telling myself I'll be fine once I move. I really hope I will at least be more comfortable and stop freaking out so much. I will. Except for the hours Nick will have to be at work, and I'll be at a place with no friends and only imagination of what has happened in close proximity to where I'll be. Vietnam class. I wonder if American presidents ever take history classes. I always sit in the front row, never otherwise. I don't even sit with friends in classes because I HAVE to sit in the front. Why? I have no idea. Anyway, so we always watch videos on the Vietnam war. And I always either get really angry or have to pinch my skin to not cry. Colonel Simpson always looks at me and then looks away really fast. It bothers me when people look away from the screen when dead, mutilated bodies are shown, that's the point bitches. You are supposed to see this. Not like you'll remember after drinking beer upside down and fucking your brains out at some frat house in IV anyway. God, I'm so angry. I've been going to the gym and to the pool to swim laps. Makes me feel better for a few hours. The more I try, the harder it gets. My mom has stopped calling me every day, instead she sends e-mails. Jaclyn's been getting me through this a bit. ""i'm surprised you've lasted this long"". that's promising. I think I need to write. Not, in livejournal. I really hate livejournal, and the facebook, and myspace. And I hate i-pods. I used to want one. And it's fine to listen to music when you run or work out. But jesus people, take you fucking headphones off when you are walking in a group of people. Or just walking in general. Listen to the birds and the wind. They even take their i-pods when they go lay our at the beach. That doesn't even settle in my head. 
That reminds me. When I was a kid the concept of wind boggled my mind. I was convinces the wind came from the trees when they moves their leaves around. I just could never understand why they'd want to make wind."

"event","so i decided that i have the uggliest livejournal ever. so i majorly need to make it better in like 2 minutes.


this weekend was so wierd. 

friday- i was supposed to be in a haunted house with my friend jakie but ballet rehersals ruins peoples lives. Then i was supposed to go to ari's but  satan i mean my mom grounded me for ""challenging"" her or so she calls it. Then i was invited to go to annas house with sneha and i was able to go. Only because it would make the driving situation to dance easier on my mother.

At annas house we at hot pockets and made smores and then we gave her dog a walk. Apparently anna walks her dog every night really late for like mile and a half. While we were walking  i decided that the stars were really pretty so i impulsively started lying on the road in the middle of the street and then her dog came over and stepped on my mouth. But the stars are amazing in greenport and coram is shafted and has like no night sky.


When we got home from our walk we went into her room and anna and sneha broke her couch/bed. Then i fell asleep and woke up to celine dion ave maria blasting. I was so confused. 

The next morning we woke up and got tea at this tea place. We got the tea for two special complete with scones and sandwiches and desserts. We got cinamon and choaclate mint tea. The cinnamon was incredible but the chocolate tasted like ass. 

We left for dance and then took class. Which was such a waste of time because dimitri decides tp make us wait 23890 hours for his decision to cancel rehersals. We didnt even have to go.. AHHH

When i got home i fell asleep form like 5-9:00

i feel gross but im not showering. 

wow i need a haircut

seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaa"

"event","wow i haven't written in a long time.

I think i'll start to write regurally again.

Well today was a shitty day.

 Im at ballet in the library and children are due at any moment to come in this room and ask me questions in which the answer is obvious. Such as ""Is that a Laptop!!?!!""  ""YOUR ON THE INTERNET AT BALLET"" and stuff like that. 

So nutcracker shit has started once again. For those who know what it was like last year, it is worse this year.

Dimitris being retarted and pissing EVERYONE off. 

I am a girl at the party this year. Like what the hell. I was a boy for 3 years and now they put me as a girl. I like being a boy thank you very much. I wonder how wrong this sounds for someone who has no idea what i'm talking about.

Im in a new school this year. Longwood yup. Its a huge school with aprox 3,700 kids. No joke. Thats a huge transition. Also the students are totally different. Everyone wants sex and thats all the guys care about. Well the gangster ones for the most part.


Ha dimitri just walked in and now is talking to himself. 

Yeah its pretty funny.


Okay he is gone

So anyway. Yeah as i was saying. 
School sucks

I guess its not that bad though,

Its better than being home all day long

So i have to go cause i have to pee

eww my coffeee just got rly cold.. gerrrossss

seeeeeee yaaaa"

"event","Wow i havent written in so long but i guess ill start now.

I will start of by saying that last week was extreme torture! 
and if i said that BESFI had nothing ot do with my previous statement...i would be lying.

Being that vicki wasn't there i had no one to talk to.

at all.

Since Cherie wasn't there Blair had no on to talk with also.

Every day when i went into the dressing room for lunch (refusing to eat with the group of bitches..--no names needed---) blaire would come along and talk to me.

The first day i didn't care that much but as the days went on i was afraid that while she was rambling about some meaningless shit i would lunge across the room and begin to strangle her. I dont mean to be completely violent or anything.. but she was just really pissing me off. SHE JUST DOESN'T STOP TALKING.

I felt a little bad though because on thursday she was talking about how she wanted choclate but claims she 
can't have any in fear that she will gain weight and then she was rambling how all her friends yell at her and tell her to eat more because she is too skinny. 

My responce was a cold stare that basically said "" are you fucking kidding me?""

She was obviously rubbing it in my face and bragging about how skinny she is and shit and pretending that she hates when people say she is too thin although we both know that she loves it. 
So after she realized the look on my face and shut up for the first time in 20 minutes, i left the room.

Thank god i missed monday because four days of blair is engough.

i only missed on monday because i quit ballet....for a day

i was really honest with my mom and told her that i feel like there is nothing in dance for me and that i am wasting my time.

after and hour and a half of explaining she finally said "" if this is really what you want to do then it is your decision""

so i didnt go the next day to besfi but then when i heard her say  "" if i had the oppurtunities that she has i would never give them up...blah blah blah blah blah""

so that made me feel like crap and for some reason i feel like i can't let my mom down. and that i would be fine with quiting if she was okay with it but i cant stand the thought of her being dissapointed in me. i know it might sound weird but that is that.

okay so thats enough of the dance subject.

i have my own room for one week!! yayayayayayay! 

well only because the music room that was built for my brothers to record in is free because they are recording in LA at the moment but while they where gone for the past 2 months my brother paul used that as his room but now that hewent on vaca in dominican republic it was free and i took it.
and this is the first time i am able to have my own room.
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!

it is the best thing ever!!!!!!!!

---i saw charlie and the choclate factory. 

being that i love johnny depp and the original movie i loved the second one..althoough it was a little boring in the middle...i still like it alot.
well i have to go now because if i dont my sister will have my head.

buuuuuhhh byeesssss"

"event","Well its about 7:00 in the morning and i talked my mom into letting me stay home from school. Well im updating now because i had this dream (with you guys in it) and i knew i would forget so i wanted to post it as soon as i could.

SO this is THE DREAM:


I was on my way to sieskaya and eveything was going normal until i got in there. ALL I could remember was that my hair was all a mess and valia stared yelling at me. Then when i walked into class you guys were there visiting. But all i see is that sarah cut her hair to her chin and died it black and Elizabeth just sitting there giving everyone death looks. So after i say hi to you guys we started class but the lights were off and instead of ussing the barre we were all using the front of cars. Then out of nowhere i am in a health food store and my mom was talking with some guy and i started crying because i couldn't hear anyone. Then i ended up at the dumb besfi competition and then thats all i remembered. 


So that was my dream. And now that i wrote that down...i am going back to bed!"

"event","Yesterday was mothers day and we went out for dinner with my dads side of the family. We attempted to have a nice/quiet dinner at a awesome resturant called amici's, but when we got there and realized that they screwed up our reservation ..nice/quiet was not included in our vocabulary. My uncle was being hysterical and almost killed that manager. It was so loud in that room and we were waiting to be seated for over an hour. When we finnaly were seated they stuck the 15 of us in a corner!! First of all i am no  Mary-Kate olsen and they stuck me in a corner that not even and emaciated freak could fit in. But they felt bad for making us wait and giving us the crapiest seats ever that they kept on giving us all this bread and olive oil.


The food was really good but i wasn't feeling well and i didn't want that much to eat but i did have some salad and spinach and pasta. We left the restaurant and came home. I watched about 37042170127401 episodes of i love lucy and happy days and then i fell asleep. So that was my mothers day. Well i have to head off for school. buh bye"

"event","WOW! haven't updated in a while. Im so tired. I woke up this morning at 7:00 to go to work at 8:00 where i remained until 5:00. It is insane how much time filing medical records can consume. Im working ot make money so i can go to puerto rico, so im basically spending my whole vacation working. But i really don't care becuase id rather not have a real vacation now ,where all i would be doing is sitting home, as opposed to working and getting money to go to puerto rico. TO me...there is no comparasson. 

So the BESFI show went well yesterday. Although my doubles weren't perfect i had so much fun on stage doing gang . I coulndn't stop laughing while i was on stage because justin (one of my fellow skull gang members) took a pixie stick on stage and was snorting it up his nose as if it were cocaine. It was one of those things where you have to be there to laugh. But at the moment i was dying of lauhgter.

I stayed home from dance today because im tired from work and my stomach hurts. It hurst even worse when i eat and my momma made artichokes tonight. GEEZE LOUISE! Okay well i guess i should get back to watching seinfeld, although i hate the episode thats on. Its the one where they forget where they parked thier car in the mall parking lot. WEll buh bye yall!"

"event","So i missed a total of 3 days of school and dance. And its really strange that i want to go back to them both. I thought i would never be saying this (like EVER) but i hate missing school. Not as if i miss my psycotic teachers or anythin of a sort..i just hate missing work and having to catch up on it. This whole thing started on tuesday. Well i went to the doctors office three times this month going back each time because i had this damn cold that just wouldnt go away. So i went back to the doctor for the third time on tuesday. The last other times i went these other doctors were a little ditsy( to say the least) but on tuesday i had my normal one, who my mother and i have come to notice that shes a lesbian (but thats a whole other story). So anyway on tuesday i went to see me doctor and she said that my spleen was slightly enlarged and said that she noticed how shitty i looked and i might have mono. So she gave my mom this paper of the blood work and crap and so i had to get blood work taken from my poor arm..which by the way is still swollen from that damn needle. So when i went on wednesday to get blood taken i was scared out of my mind. And the past experiences that i had when i had previous blood work didnt help at all. So it hurt like hell and they had this song  playing ,while blood was flowing out of my viens and into tubes ,and my mother kept asking me ""michelle do you know who plays this song"" ""michelle..who plays this song"" ""michelle.. whos the artist who plays this song"" ...i mean as if i cared at all. So i didnt get the results to the test back yet and i really cant do anything until i get them back because if i do get mono i am still contagious until treated. so yeyaya..my life for the past four days consisted of lesbian doctors, wathching t.v. ,sleeping, and needles. isnt it great!"

"event","Happy Easter! Wow today was an interesting day. 



I woke up at 7:30 to my mothers voice(not a good way to start out a day) and i took a shower and got ready for church. I was planning to wear my skirt that i bought in the city but i forgot to shave my legs. So at the last minute right before going to church i shaved my legs with cream and a mysterious razor i found in my drawer. Now i have this rash from my ankle to my knee. So besides that point..i went to church and on the way there all my parents did was fight. Its like theres this spirit that comes out on the holidays that causes them to fight. I guess they call that stress but honestly, how can you get stressed on easter? Its not like christmas or thanksgiving or anything. 


So after church i came home. We got bagels but i still have no appetite so i didnt have one. Which is insane because i love bagels. Then after that we just hung out at home. I was playing with my nephew who i am so in love with! I can't take it anymore. Well while i was playing with him i noticed his breath was really really really really bad. And it has been like that for a few days now. And its not like morning breath or like just ate garlic and olives breath,...it was like something died and is rotting in my body breath. So we researched online whta could be the cause of this incredibly gross breath and one of the causes was something caught in the nasal passage. So my brother (his dad) looked up his nose and saw something green peekin out. So we assumed it was a pee and he stuck it up there not knowing it would make his breath smell like ass. So we tried to get it out with many ways but then we decided not to take matters into our own hands and bring him to the emergency room. Since its easter there were not many people there. So we got in and out in a matter of 40 minutes which is unbelievable for the ER. It turns out that he stuck a piece of green styrafoam in his nose. Yes.,.it was quite wierd the first time i heard it too. So then we ate dinner and i still wasn't hungry. But i did have some food becuase my mother thought i was crash dieting. Then we watched that show about the ""strongest boy in the world"" thing. So those were the events that took place on this strange family day."

I feel really sick. I haven't eaten all day because i have not apetite and i get nauseous at the sight of food. My chest hurts really bad also. I think im dying.(that wasn't at the least bit dramatic) Sorry to be a bitch and complain but thats what im feeling like right now. Well anyway, on a lighter note, tomorrows easter and im staying home and doing nothing. For once! Normally we make a huge ordeal and have 1723809472109 people over the house, but not this year. This year its just the 11 of us (includin devon..aka the cutest child ever) eating a normal meal (hopefully i can eat by then) at home. Actually its just going to be the 9 of us beacause Josh and Joe are still on tour. I think they are going to be in Oklahoma or something. Okay well im going to put a movie on and try to fall asleep on the couch or something. xoxo"

I swear i probabally wouldn't know it existed if it weren't for the fact that the duster is in it and im the slave of the house. Today we had czardas rehersal. News for everyone that hasn't seen the dance..you are not missing much. It is soo gay and boring. And like all of the dances valia choreographs..it starts out as us sleeping. And im a boy...and i have to wear this white fur piece of shit hat on my head. It really is pathetic. So anyways....Yesterday i was at the staller center because my brother had a piano concert there and it was so weird being there. We had a reception party in the green room and it brought back soo many memories. It was really wierd. I got my hair cut on thursday and i think its the worst one it had since i was seven when it looked like a bucket was permanently attached to my head. Its not really that bad but im pissed because the woman didn't do what i wanted. But ohh well its just hair and it will grow back eventually. Okay im tired and i think ill pay a visit to that cabinet. 
 
                                        Peace out (saying it the way kip does in napoleon dynamite)"

"event","Wow..today was the most boring day ever! I took a makeup science test and i hope i got a good grade on it. I think i did though because that's the only subject that i'm good at. I had a luch detention and some kid almost stuck gum in my hair until i turned around and gave him the nastiest look to ever exist. Then i asked the teacher if i could move and so i did and listened to my cd player and stuied the whole time. The rule in the school is that we are not aloud to buy a normal luch when we have detention and all we could buy was the gross soggy/ stale peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches. I refused so i asked erin to bring me a muffin and a spoon(yes i am the wierdest....i do eat my muffins with spoons and before today when erin made fun of me i thought it was normal) but the cafeteria ran out of muffins so i had to get a bagel. So erin snuck me a bagel it was gross. (why im explaing very detailed about my luch period?..i dont even know) My mom picked me up from school and then i came home. 

OMG..Randomness....wtf is with degrassi? Why did they turn craig like that? He was always normal until these two episodes. Its really upsetting what they did to him...I AM SOO MAD!


Well i have to go now because my mom is making me eat food in front of her because she (for some reason god only knows) thinks i don't eat enough. kkk...buh-bye"

My house smells really gross because my dad went martha stewart on me and tried to makes the house smell nice. The man put apples in the oven and he burnt them. While he was taking them out i was sitting there hysterically laughing at him. I mean what the hell. The only reason he put them in there was because this apraisel lady is coming over to look at the house. Well shes here right now and she tried to make conversation with me but i just ignored her. She smelt like she poured a bottle of bugspray on her not to mention those gigantic glasses that were taking over her face! I really need to stop making fun of people but its just too much fun! So last night valia didnt teach so shiffy took over and taught. I thought i was going to die so i just walked out and so did half the class. Then thank the lord Maria taught and the whole class came back in. It was great. So the surprise party is tonight and i really dont want to go at all whatsoever. 
Okay well i have to take a shower now becaus ei feel gross!"

"event","I just got home from school, the joy of my existance. Im having the worst chest pains and back pains of my life. Im 14 years old and im not supposed to be complaining of those things so what the hell is wrong with me. I still haven't got a haircut yet and i should be tommorow or saturday. Im scared because my hair dresser  moved to guam and now i have this other lady doing it who sounds like Kermit the frog.  On saturday my gay ass mother is making me go to a surprise birthday party for Dimitri. I really don't want to go. Vicks going so it won't be that bad but still. I mean think about it.. me, michelle rose morin, who not to mention hates dimitri has to go to a birthday party for him. As if seeing his ""large and in charge"" self six days a week is not enought. Ill buy him a ham or something, that will please him for atleat five minutes. 


So school today was really boring. It seamed like the day was never going to end. Hmmmm this is how it went


Chapel- I was writing notes the whole time until my pen exploded on me and i had to go to the bathrooma nd wash my hands. I tried to get back into the auditorium but it was locked so i just waited for someone to come but to my luck no one did. Instead of listening to some guy speak about how we ware all in sin, i got to sit on the floor waiting for the whole period.

Math- Boring Boring Boring Boring Class. My teacher looks like Joe Dirt, i came to that conclusion.

Spanish- un muy aburrida clase.. Mi profesora es loca en la cabeza.

Health- I got a zero on a test that se said i took but i was absent when she gave it to me. Ella es loca en la cabeza tampoco.

English- hmm... we read animal farm and did a review sheet. 

Science- Didn't feel like taking notes so i just sat there. 

Lunch- Took a makeup test for english

History- Took a quiz..got a 90

Computer- Took Notes

Violin- Didn't feel like going so i stayed in the computer room and played inklink on bored.com....fun freaking sweet stuff!!

so that was my day. I have to go now to drop my sister off at dance......... Buh Bye!"

I went to the cityt on friday with my parents and it was a disaster. We went to the museum of modern art and they didnt even look at anything. They just past by everything like it was a piece of shit. And i asked my mom if she sould just wait for a minute so i can look at stary nights and she didnt even wait for me. She just left and told me to meet her in the lobby. But watever shes gay. We looked at the gates. Those orange curtain things...it was a little wierd because everyone was like consumed into orange cirtains. Then i went shopping and got a few things. So that was friday and it was as bad as i thought it was going to be.  Im really happy today is a snow day! But im extremely bored. Ive been having the wierdest dreams lately. Of random people. I had a dream that i was talking on the phone with beyonce and she was giving me advice about shoes. Yea it was wierd. So i need to et a haircut really bad. If my hair grows any longer it will be like down to my butt. Its gross and annoying. My mom is being a bitch. I told her that i want a trim and she said that if i just wasnt to get a trim she is going to take me to a shity place and if i want to get it styed shell take me to a nice place. But i refuse to go to any salon that contains the words Head cutters. So im thinking of chopping it all off but that wont work with my fat face. But im really not sure. Okay i have to go take a shower now because i feel grimey."

It seems that my nephew went into my nutcracker makeup and found the outlast lipstick(that stains) and drew all over EVERYTHING! I was  flippin out. So after that i went on my moms laptop and played the sims for endless hours. I really love that game. Its soo damn addictive. On friday im going into the city with my mom and my dad but i really dont want to. Im kinda pissed at them. Well ive been pissed at them since birth. But wutev. Okay im gonna get back to the sims.

Im so  tired i can't even believe it. I have come to a conclusion that i can not stand Emily Miller. My lord does she piss me off.  
I flipped out the other day due to a little problem many call PMS. But its all good. She thinks she has to tell me what to do because she is the ""gang leader"" and im the ""gang member"". And she was bitching and saying all this crap about how she is supposed to be in the middle because shes more advanced than the gang members. And i said ""Excuse me?..Just because you may have a better part than some of us doesn't mean you get to walk all over us"" and then she said ""Well thats what valia said and i favor what she says"" and then i said ""Okay Emily"" and then i walked out the room and left. I really wish that i could have punched her or something. Well enough of that. Im tired so im going to sleep."

One second i was carying my books and my bag to leave for dance, and the next i was on my butt on the way down the stairs. I didnt go because i couldnt even walk. I still cant. Instead of sitting on my extremely uncomfortable computer chair, i made my sister drag the couch over to the computer. She felt so bad for me that she is being my maid. She brought me water and made me food. I am livin' like a queen, besides the fact that i cant even sit correctly because of the pain. I didn't go to school today because my district was closed but my school was open. So i didn't take the midterms and im probabally going to have to make them up. My b-day is on friday and im so excited.Well not really that excited but im pretty happy. On saturday my mom is forcing me to go to the burklyn audition.I really do not want to go .

"event","What a day it has been. It was one of those days when plucking out your eyelashes is more apealing than sitting in one classroom for over three hours taking a test many like to call the ELA's. The sad part is that we aren't finished with them yet and still have to waste another three periods to take this test. I don't think it can prove anything because it might just have been the easiest test i have yet to take. Maybe the second part that we are taking tomorrow is more chalenging. My mom picked me up from school and i had to go counseling. I cried again. I guess when the counselor brings up my brother i cant control myself. Its not like i was hystericall crying its just that when someone brings up a sore subject you cant help but cry. Whenever we talk about my brother, it is as if i remember everything mean he has said to me and i cant hold it in. I begged my mom for me to stay home from dance and she gave in. So i traded pirouettes and tendus for  conversation on the phone with Erin.  I guess i might go read or something. The scariest thing of my life just happened . I cant write because its too intense and i am afraid so i have to leave the room due to conflict taking place. Okay, im going and im really scared now.  I will write later, dont worry."

"event","WOW!...this was the wierdest weekend of my life!..well my mother forced me to go on this winter retreat thing with my church and it was death. I had to sleep on the freaking floor. And i had an allergic reaction to the shit they called food and fed it to us. It wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be but it was pretty bad. If i had friends there then it would have been alot better but i had no one to talk to besides my sister who ignored me the entire time. So there i was in pennsylvania with a rash all over my stomach  and arms by myself reading in my hotel room while everyone else was socializing. I slept most of the retreat and since it is so cold up there i am really sick now. I would stay home from school tomorrow but i have to take those damn ELAs. Bummer..Big huge bummer! So anyway..my layout sucks..i dont care..oh well..

This band is in my house and they are paying my brothers to record them so they are in the room im in. To bad there ugly. I threw up all over them. They are teaching my little brother how to play blackbird on the guitar and now he just wont stop playing the damn song. Hes ruined a perfectly good song because he plays the same part over and over again. SOOO mad! Okay well im dead tired and i have to throw up on the ugly kids...jk

yeah, so like um .... yeah, like so... yeah um ..... oh yeah, um oh so like yeah,  ooh yeah, like um, soo ...
okay..
okay im going to bed..xoxo"

"event","Okay so i made a new user name because some how my mother found out. She wouldnt expect me to have this screen name because she probabally thinks im satanic or something. I cant even walk out of a store without her making me show her a reciept so she knew i didnt steel anything. She is really INSANE! Were doing street people for besfi. The cast list went up today and im a Skull gang member. I get to wear fishnet stokings and   rinestones and chains and stuff like that. But i would really like to know why they are even mentioning besfi when nucracker just ended. Cant they give us a damn break for a while. Apparently not. Today at school this bitch in gym class threw a basket ball at my face. It was an accident or so she says. My nose hurts really bad and i hope i didnt break it. My mother was going to take me to the doctors because it was swollen but she was busy. Busy as in going to Fridays with her friend from some bible meeting. She is pissing me of sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Anyway....


Thet funniest thing happend. Well not really that funny but whatever. Okay so i was in the dressing room and the acd 2 girls were getting ready to go into class. This girl Jenna comes up to me and goes ""Are you depressed?"" 
and i said ""Why are you asking me this?""
and she was like ""Because you look it""

How con someone look depressed when they are sitting down listening to music and doing their homework. What did she expect me to do jump around the room laughing and giggling. wtf? 
okay so i have to go now because im extra tied. xoxo"

"event","Slack is good with the little ATV, and she's good with the GPS that generally comes with using things like (stolen) cars smaller than Reckoning.

She's also pretty good with shopping.

She's <i>not</i> that good with waiting, and ignoring the GPS, demands of her passenger, ""Are we even sort of almost there yet?"""

"event","""Why is it,"" Slack mutters, walking in through the fridge hold door inside Reckoning, arms full of puppy, ""that every time I go to Milliways and come back -- usually freezing -- it's like nobody's ever in here?""

She's addressing the air, more than anything, while Furball nips playfully at her nose."

"event","Slack is <i>freezing</i> as she slips into the top of the hatch of Dead Reckoning, still dressed in her work garb -- for her <i>other</i> job, the one that isn't driving the truck or manning the turret, <i>that</i> job -- and thus really cold.

Because this is Prince Edward Island, where it tends to be cold.

Colder, since a lot of the settlement has no power. Or air treatment. Or shelter.

""'nybody home?"" she asks, grabbing a granola bar off Prettyboy's dashboard and collapsing into a cushy chair by the fridge."

"event","Time is silly.

So it's probably early to Slack's addled brain, but possibly later in the afternoon, or it <i>could</i> just be midday ...

... Either way, she very slowly leans over in bed and pokes Po.

""Hey. Lump. Awake?"""

"event","In the last private pod of the Reckoning trailer, there's a double bed with black sheets, whitewashed walls (this is the only room that has any white in it at all), a small table with a pot of freshly-woven roses (woven as Po made them for her, they can't be picked anywhere in the wastes), and an armoir with a mirror.

Slack's space.

It may be two in the morning, but she's still up, just in a dressing gown, combing her hair in front of the mirror.

She doesn't sleep much."

"event","""I found the gum!"" Slack is triumphant, and she sounds ever-so-proud, shoving a couple sticks in her mouth and blowing two bubbles at once. It's a talent.

Where's she sitting? Behind the registry of the long-abandoned Howell's Bar on Mason Street. She found the gum, and she's also found several other things, like the cash register, some candy, breathmints, and --

""Slack, for <i>crying out loud</i>, you're looking for the medicines back there, not the candy!"" yells Riley Dembo.

""Awesome, canned food!"" exclaims the voice of Prettyboy from a back room. ""I think we scored bigtime.""

""There's, uh, there's fruit,"" stammers Charlie from another corner, ""but it's, er,""

""We don't want it,"" Motown confirms. ""Old and moldy.""

Rather, the bar <i>itself</i> could be called old and moldy -- it's definitely dustier than anyone's seen a bar in a while. Not like a bar Slack usually frequents these days.

The others just haven't seen a bar in over a year.

""You're old and moldy,"" says Slack, handing Riley a stick of gum.

""I love you too,"" he replies."

"event","""So in conclusion, we've got to find a way to get back in."" Riley Dembo placed his drink down on the crate, looking triumphant. Yes, it was cheap swill, but it was still a drink he could smack down on a crate to make himself look more triumphant.

Charlie wasn't too fond of the idea. ""Slack's been doin' fine with supplies, Riley ..."" 

""But it's not just the supplies, no matter what Slack's been able to do with this Milliways place. It's the people, there's people in there.""

""I thought,"" Prettyboy ventured, ""that we were looking to be alone.""

""And if we're <i>not</i>,"" said Slack, ""there's Milliways. If I could just get the rest of you to come with me you'd stop worrying --""

""You are all so selfish sometimes!"" Riley gave glares individually to the assembled - to His Crew, one by one - Charlie, Prettyboy, Slack, Pilsbury, Motown. ""There are <i>people</i> in the Green, still, and they've obviously got no government --""

""So one by one, we will take it over. Slack's got otherworldly friends with leadership experience, and with their guidance, we will name Riley King, and build monuments to Number 9 and Cholo and Foxy and Mouse,"" Motown laughed, making a noble proclamation in his way.

""No. We'll wheedle our way in.""

""<i>Wheedle</i>, Riley?"" Prettyboy sounded suspicious.

""There'll be people we have to get by. They want Dead Reckoning the truck. They do not want its crew, and I bet we'll have a lot of wheedling to do if we need to get around that. So we should obviously do what any intelligent leader does - send in a girl first.""

Prettyboy massaged her temples. ""Oh, Dembo, don't make me--""

""I was thinking of Slack, actually.""

Slack nearly spit her swill into Riley's face, coughing. ""Me? Riley, honey, I get where you've gotten the idea, but I am no <i>courtesan</i>, I am a <i>streetrat</i>. And all of my friends?"" She spun her arm about, acknowledging each. ""Are also streetrats. Within reason, anyway, Riley, I get you've got a decent family background, not that you'll share it. But if you want a pretty, persuasive, seductive girl?""

""Then we've got one,"" chimed in Pilsbury.

""-- yeah, okay, so then maybe you'll want me, but not if you're appealing to upper classes.""

""You do know how to tango,"" said Prettyboy.

""Like that makes all the difference,"" Slack laughed. ""I'll think about it, babe, okay?""

~*~

""If we're storming the Green to get back in, we'll need supplies.""

""Yes, Riley, I know. That's Slack's job.""

""Thanks, Charlie,"" said Slack from the divan, where she was nursing a small gunshot wound (#14 in the last two months) and giving it Looks, muttering about stenches having weapons. ""Gimme a list.""

""We need to prowl more. The rest of us are getting spoiled, not having to work as much.""

""Riley. Listen."" She grabbed his coat collar. ""You can come <i>with</i> me there, you know.""

He shook his head. ""Naw. You don't want us. Reckoning, s'our place. We belong here, not amongst people. That's where you differ from us, girl.""

""Like I said, I'm no courtesan. And my friends'd like you, I know exactly how you'd all be introduced -- Charlie, the finest sharpshooter in the land - until he meets Richard Sharpe! Motown, the second-best hotwirer in our world - Pilsbury, the <i>real</i> best hotwirer in our world! Prettyboy, the best thing with fireworks besides Jubilation Lee and Ace Hunter! And Riley, our Fearless Leader who <i>really</i> needs to get laid.""

Riley threw a shoe at her.

""I got <i>shot</i> there, Dembo, watch it!""

Flinging the shoe back, Slack jumped out of the trailer, garnered with lists. ""Off for supplies, then!""

And in she went to Milliways."

"event","""If we're stuck waiting one more minute for her, I swear I'll--""

""Is that her?""

Riley Dembo and Charlie Bates lean against a wall, looking incredibly, invariably bored. 

Really bored.

""That can't be her,"" says Riley.

Charlie cautiously looks through his gun sight. ""No -- no, Riley, I think it is.""

They'd come to check every day for a week to see if Slack had come out of what seemed to be a totally empty mall yet, hoping she'd emerge with supplies and not with a bite ... and at last ...

<i>""Charlie!""</i> The sound is a squeal, but a distinct squeal, in the voice of a very distinct person. 

Slack, followed by a man unfamilliar to Charlie and Riley, but to Slack is known as Po.

And she flings her arms around his neck. ""Charlie, Charlie -- I missed you, you idiot -- you did realize I'd been gone, didn't you?"""

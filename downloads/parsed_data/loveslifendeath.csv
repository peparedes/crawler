I'm so fucking tired of people changing how they act.

AGH.

If you think you're so much better than me and shit, then why do you pretend to be nice to me and my friends

then you flip to your other ugly fucking heart you cold hearted bitch.


Know one fucking cares about you excepte for shits who will turn their back on you. Stop pretending to be cool and get certain pleasures. 

I'm not hurt or concerned about getting hurt, just go cut yourself...it won't hurt you, you do it wrong anyway.

Go crave for attention.

No one will give you it anyway."

Current mood:  sad 


Tonight was the fucking saddest night ever. I went to the SPOM with Sarah, Chrissy and Evangeline and just so much stuff happened and all that made me so fucking sad.
So here it goes.
My dad dropped us off and we walk down to the enterance and decide to walk to shelby farms...anyway we're leaving and I see this guy that I liked SO fucking much and shit, and he just kinda looked at me and I did the same and didn't do anything. That was fucking sad. The one time I see him, he fucking hates me. I was about to cry. 
We come back and we're standing at the first stage and people are moshing and shit and I see him, and i'm just looking and I told Chrissy about it and she did like a sad AW face and It made me so angry with myself and him. 
Then we decided to sit on the ramp and he kept moving and shit and walked past us maybe 2 times and then moved to the crowd that was close to us then just left.
It was so fucking horrible. Then we went to watch the fireworks and we all we're saying how lonely and how this guy chrissy was suppose to met and shit wasn't there or we didn't see him and it made me feel so bad. 

I have no idea why I wanted to tell you guys, but it just made me feel like I have no one that loves me as much as he said he did. 
He was the best thing to me then it just went away."

"event","<P><FONT size=1>wow i hate to type a lot at 2:21am, but i must share my expierence of my first 2 days of music fest so far. Ok, so on Friday, it fuckin poured, we got wet, we saw people we knew and Switchfoot was fuckin amazing. Chrissy bawled, i teared up and wow. They spoke about life and it was just so beautiful. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Earlier today when we got there we got there at about 5 or whatever, there were so many fuckin people and it was muddy and disgusting as hell. <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> everyone was getting drunk and stoned,buy pipes, and necklaces with weed or stuff like that. So we went to see Collective Soul so we could hang out and be pretty close and stay their for Corssfade and the Killerz...wow did that suck. If it had been like the crowd on Friday, i woulda been all YAY! <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> hibbie gibbie stuff, but NO. Everyone for some fuckin odd reason kept coming. Sarah, Chrissy, Claire and myself were right by this gate that goes around the stage, <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> it turned out we were where the ""door"" was. HOLY FUCK THAT WAS STUPID. All these people came through, and were leaving, i didn't even know who the fuck Collective Soul was until we left. So first thing I see is a guy in a parachute...riiiighhttt, someone says its the lead singer and then i'm like wow landed pa retty far away. Then some chick says that he smacked some 18 year old girl over there <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> that's why it was takin so long, and all this shit, sayin they canceled. So we're waiting, pepople are pushin,shoving, movin,yellin and fuckin gropin us. I have never been touched that much in a period of 20 minutes in my life by absolute strangers. Finally, Collective Soul comes on <STRONG>&amp; </STRONG>more people are goin and comin which i'm wonderin why they're leavin, and someone said cuz of the mosh pit which i was about to be all over like lines or ruled notebook paper. We saw people gettin kicked out for surfing or whatever it's called...cough retards cough. Then there came this lady who looked like she was with her teenage girl, who looked like the one that got kicked in the face, so they music was goin and that lady was wipin the girls face lookin like she was tryin to make her happy...NO. ABSO FRICKIN LUTELY NOT. They were both so fuckin high <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> drunk i don't think they even heard the music or anything else, kinda like when you laugh extremely hard and you kinda lose your hearin during the brief moment. Then it becomes fuckin gammed back, and Claire hit the gate cuz we were bored then 20 or 30 minutes later the security guard who looked like Santa Clause, pushed the gate with all his might from the other side movin us the crowd into each other when we had no fuckin room. then he did it again! so the lady who i thought was the mom pushes back and she was really weird <STRONG>&amp; </STRONG>was dancin and grindin with Claire cuz that's how little room we had so he took her and i was kidna relieved then all these peopel kept comin so i was like fuck i can't be this close to pot smokin drunk stragners so i pushed Claire and we pused through people to get some room. It was so fuckin scary. I mean I don't wanna sound like a weiner and all, but I mean i've seen people go down in crowds and not get back up. During this there is this pretty damn fi0ne blonde haired guy right behind Chrissy and next to Claire<STRONG>&amp; </STRONG>kept watchin me and stuff and laughin at what we were sayin that made me glad. So many guys, drunk <STRONG>&amp; </STRONG>not, hit on us. Wow, i love it. :D When Sarah <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>&nbsp; i got seperated from Claire <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> Chrissy, we were walkin through the clothin area and this guy looks and me and i smile then i moved my hair, <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> since it had rained the night before i had to try my jacket in Sarah's dryer so it kinda shrunk and so my jacket went up and he goes DUH AM <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> then i look at him and he goes YOU'RE FUCKIN SEXY AS HELL then i looked back at him and walked away. The night before made me the happiest, so we all are walkin, soaked, to Claire's car, when these 2 guys in the street walk past us, Chrissy is behind me, so they walk past me and I look and kinda smile then they walk past Chrissy then Chrissy comes up to me and says Alexis, those guys said to tell you, you were hot. I was like yes yay feel gorgeous so i scream Thank you <STRONG>&amp; </STRONG>they look back <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> smile So Chrissy is just sayin how he walked past her <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> said that they wanted her to tell moi, their friend, i was hot. then I scream again I LOVE YOU SWEETHEART <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> that was it basically that happened at Music Fest that was interesingly big and shocking! Well, i gotta go and get some sleep BILLY IDOL&nbsp;<STRONG>&amp;</STRONG> CHEVELLE are tomorrow, i think i'm only goin with chrissy, definatley, that I know of. </FONT></P>"

I want someone to hold me when I'm scared, wipe my tears when I cry, and always make me laugh and smile. I've found one guy that makes me laugh and smile so much and i love it.

"event","<center> I haven't written in this for quite sometime. Man, last Friday was crunk as shit. Sarah, Chrissy, Evangeline, && myself went to the movies and saw Fever Pitch. It was fuckin hilarioous and so adorable. Chrissy was crying so hard during it. Just like someone died right next to her. Yeah, it was crunk as a mother. Sarah a.k.a Laquisha said we had to do it again when I was at Starbucks with her. Oh yeah. I'm doing my hair with some streaks in it. I put a few red in and I'm going to do black, but I am afraid it with stain my neck...I was thinking of getting a black outline of a star tattoo on my left wrist, and I still want to, I told my mom and she didn't say anything.</center>

<center> Someone needs to have a crunk party. It gets so fuckin boring when you don't have a car and when the people you know have one, they are always to far away or gone before you ask them. It makes me sad. As you <i>might</i> know, I love double stuffed oreos! They are as I said, "" My Scooby snacks. I would do anything for one."" Yes...it was awesome. People at school are really startign to piss me off. Claiming they are something and shit, god it makes me want to scream and grab them and tell them. Whatever they want to think. Well that reminds me, I'm watching Lifetime. Yeah, one of the best channels on Earth. Later</center>"

"event","yay one day until Christmas (eve w/e)
so anyway... I really don't have a lot to say,
It's pretty cold outside here (Chicago)and everyone outside is wearing fur coats
including my mom, but hers is fake. They just left to go shopping but w/e. So I'm here all
alone with Alecia, who is watching Beetlejuice. 



Nobody knows,what it's liek to be left outside alone- Anastatica


                  [I'm OK]
Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Everytime my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

It's not so easy to forget
All the lines you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day I'm afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see there

Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK
I'm OK"

 Oh, just to tell you people who don't know this already the only reason WHY all the guys or girls (?) like the ""preps"" (coughloserscough) is because they're easy and let anyone take advantage of them. Yeah okay?

"event","let me just tell all you little mother fuckers out there, I have anger problems, It may not seem like it but I DO! Okay, example: in fifth grade this girl lied and lied and LIED to everyone that she was going out with my best friend who didn't even go to our school and/or like her. She kept lying to her ""friends"" that she did and to me even though I no she didn't. She would say stuff like your jealous Alexis, why the hell would I be jealous of a girl that has to lie to her ""friends""  to make herself seem popular? So one day after school I couldn't take it i pushed her down and beat the shit outta her face. DAMN SHE LOOKED TORE UP! I even threatened her if she told I would go looking for her and would do it again and even worse and will kill her if she lies to me, infront of me or even around me. 
   Go ahead and say I'm a crazy bitch, if you piss me off I will kick your ass. Mess with me I'll mess with you right back. I'm tired of people saying shit about me, making fun of me or doing anything that hurts me inside. I will hurt you, inside and out. That girl you lied to me all those times has a messed up nose ( its crooked) and she is screwed up on one side of her brain, since i fucked her nose up. Now, you may think I'm lying and that I don't look or seem like it beacuse I go or went to your school, HA! Ask any of my friends that were there with me."

This morning about 11 i have 2 pieces of toast. Which is okay. And i didnt get full, or nothing, so i think thats all ima do for today. Maybe a little something later. But what really kinda got me down, was how hard i worked yesterday, and the scale didnt budge, due to my stupid period!! grr. i hate being a woman sometimes.Its not fun at all...well, on that part ne ways

I want to loose a few more before Friday, because we are goin to Bakersfield, and i dont wanna have to get all worried that ima put on all my weight. Cause i know well go out to eat and wat not, and i want to be able to have fun and not freak out ya know?. So its Monday. Tomorrow, ill be at Rachels, that might be alittle hard, cause we like to snack together. But i did okay last time, Then Wed. i have no clue what we are doing. And then Thurs is Gilroy day, and i might eat some there too. But i think i can do it. If i loose something tonight. ill be more motivated to do good tomorrow and the next few days.

It kinda hurts when you have cramps on an empty stomach. But i really have gotten to the point where i am ""good"" at saying NO. i havent been on ne binges in like 2 weeks, and just knowing that i am getting stronger in kicking this thing in its ass, i feel alot better you know?

Im in this Community =Longingtobethin= and i really really like it. I dont feel judged there. Its just. well Girls like me, even if they are skinny, fat, chubby, or just right, we all want to do something for our bodies. and i love it.

I think that i did good for that first real entry. So ima go make some more sites rounds, and catch back with you later tonight and seeing how well i did.

<3 Meg"

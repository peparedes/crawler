"event","I am so friggen tired. I had a game last night, one at 11:40 today, and another one today at 4:30. The one last night was against tewksbury. We won 5-2. I've played some retarted teams before but i think these guys top it. So many friggen cheap shots. It was unbelievable. It was pretty entertaining though. I hit a kid harder than i've hit anyone else this season. People in the stands kept bitching about it but i didn't get called for it. We played them again this morning and won 3-0. Again, more cheapshots. Then we played everette and won 5-1. So we've playing pretty good lately. we only have like 6 weeks left in the season and i think we're in the playdowns right now or the districts or something. i have a game like every day this week which kinda sucks but oh well. The taste of chaos tour is coming up in like a week. CAN'T FUCKING WAIT!. its gonna be so sick."

"event","Yeah i haven't updated in a long ass time mostly cuz i didn't feel like it. A lot of shit's happened but i don't really feel like typing all of it. Friday i went to the celts game with my cuz and then we went to hooters after. Then saturday i went skiing and then sunday was the super bowl. Before the super bowl amelia and desi came over which was pretty sweet. The 28th i'm gonna go to the Taste of Chaos tour with gabby, amanda, kevin, matt and probably some other people. It should be pretty sick. And by the way about that shit that people left in my other entry...for whatever reason people in arlington got this rumor that i was moving there and that i was gonna go to their school. No one really likes me there (like i give a shit) so they all left that crap. It's like why the fuck would i move there after i JUST moved to andover. Most of the people there suck too. whatever but i'd really like to know how that one got started. Anyways i'm just chillen here putting music on my ipod. not much else goin on"

"event","I got my guitar thursday and it's sweet! Good for a starter anyway and the amp doesn't sound that bad either. I've been playing around with it for a few days. Hopefull me and my bro will start taking lessons soon. I was supposed to go the movies yesterday but things changed so i didn't but i'm going today though. Two of my cd's that i ordered came yesterday and i'm listening to one of them. I got the new The Used album- In Love and Death and The Starting Line- Say it Like You Mean it. I'm still waiting for the new Taking Back Sunday album- Where you Want to Be. Christmas break starts next week. don't know what i'm gonna do yet, probably just hang around and chill, maybe go skiing if i'm lucky. So yeah i have to go get dressed and eat breakfast and shit."

"event","We actually won our game last night! 2-1 against groton. thank god. It was a pretty good game. I played defense cuz i'm starting to get into it. if the coach lets me and if i want i'll probably play defense the rest of the year. I haven't updated in a while cuz i just haven't gotten around to it. I ordered a guitar and it should be here in like three days. And i'm going to new york in jaunary. And i got a silver necklace today. These can all count as my presents for chanukah. I was out sick today. I felt like shit when i got up and then about 20 minute into science class i was like fuck this and i went home. Saturday was pretty cool. I went to the rockingham mall with colleen, emily, and bobby and we hung around there for awhile. I got some cd's, some shirts and other crap. Then bobby left and we went back to emily's and hung out there. One of her friends came over and we watched empire records. it was pretty sweet. I left my shirt there cuz i was putting on one of the ones that i bought and then i left the one i was wearing there and now i want it back. So yeah kinda feel like crap now and i'm out of it cuz i took nyquill. Oh well i'll probably be better tomorrow."

"event","Not too much happened today. Had the english test but it wasn't that hard. Washington was awesome! <3Collen. Both rides were like 10 hours but they weren't that bad. My room kinda sucked but oh well. other than that the trip was pretty good. Got a bunch of lighters and crap and morm tried to bribe a person into buying him a playboy. The hotel was pretty good. We got free HBO. I've got ashley's and rachel's bat mitzvah's coming up this weekend which should be fun. I get to see a lot of people i haven't seen in a long ass time. Had a hockey game sunday against north reading. We destroyed them like 7-1 and i got a pretty sick goal. Basically we just bitched them around the whole game. We've won our last few games. Our teams finally starting to come around. i locker boxed against stev last night after practice. i pretty much whooped his ass. now we're gonna have more guys do it so it should be pretty entertaining. Thats it for now. Pe@ce"

"event","The reunion yesterday was pretty sweet. It was at fun and games. I played video games a while. Most of the people there i knew and i saw a lot of my friends. The food was pretty crappy as usual but oh well. The ice cream was good though. We got to see the video yearbook then we got our reunion shirts. After that i didn't do much of anything else. I had the science test today which i didn't really study for so i dunno if i did well on it or not. My shoulder was killing me for some of the day. Washington in two days!"

"event","We actually played awesome at our game last night. After a few games of losing we were due. Me, nick, and stev got everyone pumped. We're pretty much the leaders of the team. We were playing nashua. Stev scored the first goal. Then i scored the last three. We won 4-0. Everyone played better than they usually do. Didn't do much today. I hung with nick and andy and then we hung at andy's for a while. Parent went out so we chinese food. And only a few minutes after being home jeff was yelling at mike. What a friggen surprise. Whatever. Got a camp reunion tomorrow which should be fun as usual."

"event","Tonight was pretty sweet. Me, marco, baroni, sylvester, newman, and mike went into the woods and we had a little bon fire. We burned a shit load of newspaper and stuff and almost started a forest fire. Newman almost lit baroni on fire like 5 times. We used a lot of fuckin lighter fluid and did some pretty crazy stuff. The parentals will probably notice how much fluid is gone but whatever i don't really care. No school tomorrow for the election which is sweet. Dunno wat i'm doing yet. Probably sleeping and lighting more stuff on fire with marco and the others. We're planning on making molotovs if we can get the right stuff to do it with. Didn't go to practice tonight cuz of my fucking shoulder. It hurts like a bitch. Oh well i'll sleep on it."

"event","Not much goin on tonight. Me and mike got the house to ourselves which is nice and we got chinese food. Stayed up all wednesday night and watched the sox game. Got my progress report today and got nothing below a b which was much better than wat i expected. Not all that much going on this weekend. Got two hockey games and hopefully the kids that are on my line will show up cuz we're pretty much the strongest line and we score most of the goals. I'm pretty surprised that me and one other kids aren't higher up but watever the teams not that bad. My cousins might come over saturday and i might go to the movies or something. Thats about it."

"event","Had a hockey game last night at phillips academy. Everyone was there so my line didn't get much ice time. We played everette and we won 5-0. It was our first shut out of the season and all the kids that never score goals scored. I'm probably going to the sad cafe tonight with my brother to see Mile23 play. It should be pretty cool. Other than that i might not do much of anything. Might see a movie or something but i dunno yet. Gonna be busy most of tomorrow cuz i got 2 games."

"event","My hockey team actually did well last night. Not only did we win but we kicked everette's ass 7-1. Amazing. Hopefully we can do that more and not get slaughtered all the time. Got practice tonight and a long weekend comin up. Oh and by the way if any of you saw that comment on my first entry (which i deleted) that was andrew efstathiou from winchester. Yeah he's bascially a complete trashy piece of shit and he's racist against jews too. So yeah not that much goin on."

"event","I got my first hockey game today with my Andover team. Hopefully they got something to show but i won't count on it. We're playing malden at hockey town. Maybe after this game if i kick some ass they'll look more into putting me on one of the better teams like the 3 or 2 teams. I really don't feel like gettint stuck on a team that really sucks. A few of the guys on the team are ok but not many. Haven't seen them in a game yet so i don't really know that well."

"event","This is my first entry on my live journal. It's friday which is good and i'm going to my dad's for the weekend. That means i can see my friends in winchester. Not like i do that much or see anyone when i'm andover. I'll proably hang out with katie a lot but i dunno. Nothing interesting happened this week. On tuesday morning when i was walking out the door i saw that my brother had written sexy beast and my car on his trunk and roof. Me and Sara thought that was kinda retarted but watever floats his boat. Had my first practice with the Andover 4 team which i just joined this week. A few of the players aren't bad but most of them suck. I don't think they've won any games yet. I had to start out on the lowest team cuz i didn't try out for andover. Hopefully they'll move me up but i'm not sure yet. We're playing malden. We're going to hockey town which sucks cuz it's a real piece of shit rink but watever. One of the kids landed on my leg in practice and it hurt my ankle. I was limping yesterday but it wasn't entirely the kids fault and my back was hurting like a bitch too. It's fine now though. I don't have that much coming up this month. Hopefully i'll see my friend julia when she visits next weekend. I haven't seen her since the beginning of june. And also a concert that i'll hopefully be able to go to on the 16th. Well not really a concert its my friends band playing at a cafe in new hampshire. Two of them are my friends from camp. They're both like 18 or 19. They're called Mile 23 and from wat i've heard they're got a lot of talent. And if i'm lucky i'll be able to go to the yellowcard/starting line concert on november 4 but it depends one whether or not Sara's going. So thats it for now...pe@ce."

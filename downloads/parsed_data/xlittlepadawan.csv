"event","<font size=1>Making a public entry, because I feel like it. Long weekend, and I'm glad. I have a bio writing assignment, so I'll probably do it tomorrow. There's nothing else to do. Everyone's busy this weekend. I might go to Starbucks and have one of my girls days with Sarah. But other than that, everything is looking a little dull.
I've made it through a month of sophomore year. I don't know if I can survive until June. 
I'm not the person I was last year. I am somewhat, but I'm different, too. A lot different. I think it's the people who've come into my life and how much of an impact they've had on me. They changed me, most of them for the better. 
So what's new? Not a whole lot. Every day is a repetition of the last. Wake up. School. Home. Wake up. School. Home. It gets boring. I can't wait until I can drive and I can go out without calling someone to pick me up or cart me around.
A lot of my friends have been fighting and ""The Sexy Six"" has fallen apart into ""The Fab Four"" for the moment. It may work out and it may not, I'll just have to wait and see what goes on with it. 
I've been having mixed feelings about a lot of things lately. I'll be pretty confident about something or someone and then somebody (usually my mother) has to go and say something to make me think. And all of a sudden I realize that I have no reason to be confident in the person that I was thinking of, because at heart, they really aren't very considerate and they don't care about me the way they act like they do. That's a wordy paragraph... but to sum it up, I'll feel good about someone and my mother will go and bust my bubble and make me realize that that person really kind of sucks.

Oh well. That's enough for you to chew on for now."

"event","i havent written in madd long...but i'm actually sorta happy for once. I realize that I dont have a lot of friends, but the friends i do have are the best and id rather have them and not risk getting hurt over and over again like in the past from other people. Jimmys finnally found a girl, the sweetest girl, and hopefully she helps him through his depression. Alex is...well still alex. I also get to see Kyle soon which im psyched about since it feels like I havent seen him in forever. And I have Kassie...my babbyy! I love her :) its been awesome between us lately...no fighting!!(which we do sometimes haha)...and it just feels real awesome. She makes me happy, makes every problem, fear, worry go away just by talking to me. anyways, i just felt like checking in since im still alive... apparently. 

oh and im gonna kill my stomach if it doesnt stop killing me... i think my appendix is gonna explode. oh well. lol"

I was thinking before/talking....and by the way shit was phrased...it seems like she thinks she was never my everything, never my first, all this other shit that I was to her but she ""wasnt"" to me...and ive said she was before...but i guess im just one big fucking liar. She means so much to me... i want her to see that, but i guess i dont show it...i guess she just thinks shes a piece of dirt compared to stacy...but shes so much more :-\...I dont even know if im overexaggerating, it just hurt. Maybe i should just step back...never fuck with them again, let them live happily ever after, even if that means ill be miserable the rest of my life...i dont give a fuck. whatever."

"event","It feels like me and some of my friends are drifting away. I hate it cause it's felt like it with one of my bestfriends who has always been here for me...i dont want to lose her, ever. I dont want Harold to be the focus of her life...i know that sounds selfish but i feel left out and I want in. I know i still am, but its her and him now, im out of the picture...for good. I need to learn to cope with this shit and try to move on, but im still in love with her....even if I have a gf(yeah i suck at being a bf). 
Also its like my other bestfriend is drifting away because he is always with his friend and gf now...and its like he doesnt have enough time for me anymore. I hate feeling alone, I dont want to be alone...ive been alone my whole life..i dont want to die being alone too. -sigh- i guess...ill just have to deal that people have other people to turn to now, and not me."

Jimmys so messed up right now..cause I mean thats pretty hard..i know what its like to loose someone close to you. I actually like Colin from the few times i actually met him. So today I basically spent most of the day working and spending time over at his house, giving him support and someone to talk to...cause i know thats one of the most meaningful things during a time like this. When I lost Sarah, I had no one to talk to...which makes ia 100x harder. Im praying Colin..."

At school today...Carla and Alex were swapping spit..kinda gross so I go up behind her and slap her ass...haha great reaction...I think she bit his tongue. hehe. After school Alex and Stacy came over to hang out with me and Harold. We watched Miss Congeniality...YES and played videogames basically, cause we are some cool kids. Carla came over later on...and it was just us home cause my parents and siblings were out... so Alex and Carla decide to go down to get some food. WELL...it was like 20 minutes later and they still werent back so me and Stacy went to investigate. I wish I didn't... they were macking it up on my couch...REALLY macking it up..like sex with clothes on...sickos. Well after we were all back upstairs again we watched the girl next door. Finally Harold was done being lazy and talking to Kassie...soo we all went downstairs to chill some more. I made dinner while they all watched some tv. Yeah im the best cook...EVER. Everyone loved it, dont deny it. I made this chicken with like sundried tomatoes and some special stuff i put in :-D...and no Alex it was not weed...loser. Anyways...now Harold, Alex and Carla are staying over because their mom isnt gonna be home tonight and even though they could probably manage at their house, she asked my mom if they could stay over...and since harold has ""special needs"" we getta take care of him...hahaha. I love you cripple. ANYWAYS...time for some scattergories...jealous..i know."

I dont know where I'm going next year, I dont know what I'm going to be when im older..i have no clue and its kinda scary. I used to always say that I wanted to grow up, be on my own get out of my house for plenty of reasons. But now my home life is turning around...yeah i still wanna experience being on my own in college and getting married. But what if I cant support myself? I wont have anyone to fall back on anymore if I'm on my own. Right now my mom's supporting me, but she can't do that her whole life. I have to stop depending on people. My whole life I have depended on various people..when I was younger it was my mom.    When my mom was in the hospital after the accident..i had no one to depend on except Bill, so yeah hes kinda not a dependable person..but i dealt with it. When my mom moved to California I had to depend on Jimmy and his family. No one ever depends on me..because im not that kinda person they turn to. 
I'm not help to anyone. I'm just here to be a burden on everyones lives. I'm sorry to everyone for being a pain in the ass throughout my whole life time. I'm especially sorry to my family and a few close friends..."

We watched Eurotrip while Harold mainly talked to Kassie...and we pulled a stunt on him and dragged him away and J and Alex were saying really random shit haha. After that we played some Family Feud and scattergories(my games...i love scattergories). After midnight me and Stacy left and went to Jimmys. Oh man, it was craazyy. Lets just say, I got drunk off my ass. Also...never play ddr drunk lmao...the hangover the next day wasnt that good though...sucks lol. Tomorrow i get my haircut...yayy!! im getting kinda shaggy lol...ive also been too lazy to shave so im all scruffy...dude im just...scrubbing... THATS COOL...
I LOVE GAMESHOWS MORE THAN HAROLD!!! :-D"

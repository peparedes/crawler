"event","Is Livejournal still a thing? I never made it to Twitter or Facebook or MySpace, and Livejournal doesn't fill a need for me any more. But here I am, typin' when I oughta be sleepin'. Maybe you're killing time too, and you wondered idly whether any of your old Livejournal contacts have posted in the last year, and what they've been up to.

I still work at the same place, in my third position there. I finally found a department where there isn't much drama, but I can't say the work is fun.

I still study kung fu, for three years now and two belts. I was also studying tai chi, but some back problems have forced me to take a break. Strangely, when I stopped tai chi, my broadsword form improved.

My friend decided to change the rules of dating. He took Japanese lessons, signed up for a Japanese marriage service, brought his new bride to Iowa, promptly sired an offspring, and just declared he'd like to find a job where he can telecommute from Japan. A year ago he was still trying to decide between two of the original six eligible bachelorettes. There was a time when I found our friendship a little dull.

For my part, I dated a young woman ten years younger than I am. I fought it for as long as I could, but you've never seen such a hot ass. You'd melt just like I did. It was during this relationship that I truly realized I am an adult.

Tommy and Audrey are three hours away now, and seeing them is a highlight every month. It's also how I get my kid time, since Caine and Raechel are so much fun (yes, and Ethan too). It's enough to make me think I could be a good parent--but most non-parents probably say that.

When I need a problem to solve, I play with Legos. I keep waiting for the right opportunity to tell my teacher how much they resemble tai chi.

Life is good."

"event","Bradley tagged me (a while back). Being tagged means you have to write six facts/things/habits about yourself. Then you tag five other people and they can't tag you back. The six things are below and my five people are Tommy, Audrey, Mr. Poush, Jolie and Chad Coon.

*I was born with a condition called metatarsis varus in which the bones of the feet curve inward. If you take off your shoes, curl your feet as much as you can, and try to walk on the outer edges of your feet, you'll have an idea of what happens if metatarsis varus goes untreated. The thing that kept me from living that life was that my older sister broke her arm, by the simple process of sticking it under an old washing machine while it was running. I was a few months old at the time, was wearing oversized sleepers that hung well past my feet, and the doctor treating her saw me from across the room and said to my father ""Frank! That baby has metatarsis varus! We have to get him in splints!"" My father's name was also Frank.

*I've been buying vegetables from an organic farmer in Waukee who has a produce, cooking and health program. I've also taken options on two chickens and a turkey. He's from Guyana but is Indian in descent, and was trained in America as a cardio-pulmonologist. His wife is an RN. While I've been eliminating bad things from my diet for a few years now, this is my big effort at eating more good things. The most entertaining part of this for me is how people seem to think I've joined a cult, when my exposure to the farm is limited to two hours per week plus the two times I've come to see how animals are butchered. My little sister thinks it's interesting but would prefer not to know where her food comes from, my meat-and-potatoes-loving mother fails to react when I mention it, and one of my friends didn't think it was funny when I reassured her that I wasn't turning into a granola-eating hippy...because LT doesn't approve of granola. I do a few things differently now (see next item), but whether his recommendations prove correct or not, the final result is that I'm eating more vegetables, less sugar and spending 60% less on groceries.

*I've kicked the underwear habit. Sorry if you didn't want to know that, but it's because I've heard from many sources it reduces the chance of prostate and testicular cancer later in life. I don't know if a thin layer of cotton can harm you that much, but on the other hand I don't really know what good it does.

*On Thursday I attended my first martial arts class. I ended up there the same way I ended up in the organic food program: by meeting the person behind it and realizing he was a living example of his own program's success. ""Come and watch a class"" has a different meaning for him than for me, because when I did he put me to work on some rote exercises. I made an ass of myself, came back two days later, enjoyed myself thoroughly, and committed to keep attending. This is also not a cult. At the moment every part of me hurts like hell.

*Lately I've been thinking about marriage--other people's, mostly. There's a phase of early adulthood where everybody you know is getting married, and I'm starting to think there's a subsequent phase where most of them get divorced. There's also the matter of my mother, whom I love unreservedly, but whose decisions I haven't consistently understood. What I desire in marriage is a partner and equal, who neither changes for me nor seeks to change me. Somebody with whom I share respect more than and before love. Somebody who doesn't think of me in terms of what she plans to accomplish--for whom I am support, sanctuary and encouragement rather than an item crossed off a mental list. Somebody with a curious and subtle mind who tends to smell like hard work. If you can't have those things, there would be no point getting married. Sorry ladies.

*I still feel shame about calling a girl ugly in sixth grade. The worst part is I didn't mean it at all."

"event","I had this really great dream last night, and I'm not sure if it counts as lucid dreaming or not. It was rife with pop culture references, so beware.

It started out inside an episode of Star Trek: TNG where members of the crew are temporarily possessed by the living consciousnesses of alien criminals. On TV they outsmarted the bad guys and flew away; in my dream they decided the bad guys weren't so bad after all, turned the ship around, and landed it on the planet. I remember being part of the crew and looking back at the ship sitting on the ground, thinking ""The Enterprise-D can't land on planets.""

It was nighttime and we were all walking toward a big tent with open sides like you might see at a carnival. People were eating in the tent, and one of them was my former supervisor Kim. She urged me to have some of the Indian food. Kim in real life knows I like Indian food. Something seemed wrong about it so I declined several times.

The next moment, as can happen in dreams, I was upstairs in the house I grew up in, and who was with me but the Joker from Batman? It was apparent that people around us were changing and acting under some organized and centralized form of possession. The Joker and I figured out that it was by ingesting certain plants that you were possessed, and that Kim had been trying to feed me one of those plants in the tent.

My house was being marched on by plant people and we had to leave. We hopped in my car and he drove, only it wasn't my car, it was subtly different. Years ago car locks were made in such a way that you could stick a coat hanger through an open window and pull the lock open. The first form of coat hanger-proof lock that I remember was a flat tab with indentations on the flat part so you could grip it. Rather than the little round things my real car has, this car had those flattened tabs. As we were driving over a bridge I said to the Joker ""Either I'm dreaming or this isn't really my car.""

Next moment we were downtown. It wasn't anywhere I've ever been, but it was the downtown of a major city with wide streets and sidewalks, now mostly deserted. An old man came up to us and asked for something that I can't remember. I had to tell him I couldn't help. Now, throughout the dream I'd been getting the feeling that there was some importance to how you used pronouns--""I"" versus ""we,"" or something--and that the plant people could tell you weren't one of them if you used the wrong pronoun. The old man started walking away, and sure enough it turned into one of those movie scenes where everybody around us turned to face us at the same time and started marching toward us.

I said to myself ""It <i>is</i> a dream,"" as I started hearing in my head the TMBG song ""The Bells Are Ringing,"" which happens to be a song about the mass possession of a society. Then, if you remember what Magneto did to the police cars in the movie <i>X-Men</i>, I started flipping people up into the air just by putting my hands palms-up in front of me and raising them theatrically. Then I'd turn my hands over, close them into fists and lower them, slamming the plant people back down to the ground. There were a couple moments where I turned my head and the plant people next to me were standing calmly on the ground, but for the most part I got to throw people around in a really cool way. Then I woke up.

The reason I think it is lucid dreaming (which I've never done before) is that the way I realized things were different was the locks on the car. For whatever reason, whenever I'm sitting in my real car and turn to lock the door, I think about the new car my oldest sister got when I was a kid and how it was the first time I'd seen those little tab-shaped locks. And I said to myself, in the dream, ""This is a dream"" and then proceeded to do something that we all know would be fun to do in real life. But compared to the way most people talk about their dreams, I remember very few images, and tend instead to sense things as impressions rather than objects--I knew it was my car even though I don't remember looking at it and seeing that it was the right color and shape to be my car. This dream was more real than most, considering I could hear ""The Bells Are Ringing"" in my head the same as if I were awake, but not that real. And I can't explain why despite my best efforts to flip everybody up in the air, sometimes I would turn my head and there would be plant people calmly standing next to me.

But what a great dream! It combined several of my favorite things: TNG, TMBG, Batman, Indian food, and throwing people around like potato sacks.

***********

Bradley, I saw that you tagged me, and I'll follow up soon."

"event","First off, happy non-denominational holidays to everybody. I hope you got what you wanted, and I hope you wanted peace and quiet. And time with your family, of course, which is what this entry is mostly about.

Most of you know the players in my annual Christmas update, and can probably glean a general idea of what my family is like. All of us are stubborn and insecure in different ways and varying degrees, but all of us feel pretty certain about who we are and what things are important to us. As a group, we argue and tease as a way of showing love, and as individuals we tend to criticize each other for mistakes or lapses of judgment that aren't really our business. Also, most of us have huge foreheads, thanks to our father. In other words, we're like most families, and most other families are shocked when they come in contact with ours and see what passes for normal. Except for the bit about the foreheads.

It's ideal that I spend about two weeks at home each year. By the end of that I'm so worn out and desperate for peace that returning to Des Moines and my job seem like a pretty sweet deal. I came in on the twenty-third, stayed at my youngest sister's house, and went with her and her husband to Fort Spolar on Christmas Eve. Mom has a tradition intended to bring together our family and my stepfather's children: she puts sixty odd gifts on a table, we draw lots and pick one present at a time, and then trade for things we want. With children and grandchildren, that averages about nine people per year. The Spolars like anything related to hunting, fishing and the movie <i>A Christmas Story</i>. The Fuhrmans as a rule don't like anything, but will put up with cookware and gadgets. And there tend to be a few, more specific things in there, because they know I'll appreciate a drawing pad and that several of us would appreciate a small Lego set.

And do you know, the gift table and the Christmas Eve dinner went spectacularly well this year. I scored an LED flashlight (LED's are now brighter and more energy efficient than incandescant bulbs), a drawing journal, and some cooking pans, measuring scoops and a set of tacky wine glasses. But what really made it work was the fact that everybody present was either more mellow than usual or distracted. Trent's kids John and Mark were very conversational about things other than the usual hunting and fishing, and his daughter Mary Fran, who is one of those people who introduces herself as ""Hi, I'm a liberal, and my name is Mary Fran,"" spent the whole evening talking to my mother in the kitchen. That might not be Mom's first choice, being militantly conservative, but she knows how to steer Mary Fran into talking about things that average out to background noise. Mary, Adam and I spent the evening happily talking to Mark and John, and Trent was knocked out by a nasty virus. No, I wouldn't wish it on him. But it was nice to avoid an unsolicited lecture about how hunting has gone down hill, the damn democrats, and the roles of minorities in society.

Adam by himself is pretty nice to talk to. He is very conservative, yet he and I tend to agree on most political and social issues. I think we would both make good Libertarians. I just vote on the democratic ticket because the democratic party scares me about five percent less than the republican party. Ironically, the only day no conversation was to be had was when he and I went to the Portland zoo and art museum--something we'd both been itching to do but couldn't find anybody to go with.

The Portland zoo is about as good as the Des Moines zoo in terms of variety, presentation and quantity of animals. The difference is, when you go to the Des Moines zoo you're compelled to say ""This is pretty good, for Des Moines,"" and when you go to the Portland zoo, you say ""This would be pretty good, if we were in Des Moines."" And the art museum had a lot of ancient Chinese, European baroque, and contemporary American art. The baroque was a seasonal exhibit and I don't like baroque art. So it was with no sadness that I realized I'd almost missed it when it was only twenty minutes before it was time to leave. I don't like contemporary American either, but I was surprised to find several that I really liked in addition to all the usual crappy garbage from unskilled hacks. So for both the zoo and the art museum, glad I went, but I had the full experience in an afternoon. Not so Powell's bookstore--we had about an hour there on a different day, and I could have spent a weekend. Never let it be said that I don't repeat myself incessantly: any bookstore that is three stories tall and covers a city block virtually demands that you enter it and lavish adoration upon its stacks until you can lavish no more.

All of these were places I asked to go in advance because I finally figured out one reason I go so crazy around my family: I can't get away from them. I had planned this time to rent a car and say ""BYE!"" on an almost daily basis, and go lounge in a coffee shop or a bookstore somewhere to decompress. It turned out there wasn't even any time for that, and I could hardly say ""No, I'm going to the zoo and art museum with out you, because I'd rather pay for a rental car than endure your lame, lame self."" So all the use I got out of the rental car was driving up to my mother's house and back on two subsequent days. Anything you've ever heard about Portland traffic is absolutely true.

It finally got to be New Year's weekend, and a sense of dread settled on us all like a bad shirt. This was to be the time of our trip to Enumclaw (in the Seattle metro area) to see my oldest sister, her husband and their three undisciplined kids. The oldest, I must say, behaved very well around me. Apparently she threw two small tantrums when I wasn't around, and her phrase ""I want my Mommy!"" has now entered our familial lexicon for use in any situation when you want to be unreasonable and immature. She's ten. But I thought she was very nice to be around. Any time she asked me to play and I said ""I can't right now, I'm talking to your parents,"" she said OK and went to entertain herself. Any time her brother bothered her she just shrugged it off.

Then there was Sam. This kid drives me nuts not because of who he is, but because of his parents. Remember the part about how we criticize each other in my family for mistakes and lapses of judgment that aren't our business? OK. Sam repeatedly did something--like pestering me to go play while the rest of us were trying to watch a movie, or kicking my leg at dinner to see what I would do--to test my reaction. I would tell him to stop. He would do it again and keep testing me, about four times, before I would snap and tell him to knock it off and behave himself. At this point he would cry, his mother would threaten a time out, and his father would finally notice something was wrong and tell him to listen to his mother. So he'd do it once more, get a time out, and then five minutes later his mother would be in his room telling him not to worry, it's OK. So why bother listening to anything his parents said? There were no repercussions, he could do whatever he wanted. I don't blame him for always being in the principal's office, since I knew it myself well enough to comment when the wallpaper changed, but his mother thinks it's funny how often he gets called down there for pestering other kids.

Anyway, I got a new set of kitchen and steak knives from Sierra Trading Post from my sisters, $150 from my mother for a new wool coat or a new set of wingtips that ended up helping to pay for my new bumper when somebody hit me in a parking lot, a tiger-themed mug and drawings of ninjas and tigers from my niece and nephew, and two early Victorian novellas that I'd been looking for that were considered major influences on <i>Dracula</i>. Plus I got a vacation that was about 75% unstressful--a new record. And I love and cherish my family. We're all just too different and opinionated to not kill each other after long periods of proximity.

How was your non-denominational holiday?"

"event","Monday night I picked up the car and have been enjoying it ever since. It's bliss. One thing I miss about the Taurus--the only thing--is that you could tell just by how hard the engine was working how fast you were going. The Accord doesn't emit any clues like that, and the difference between a neighborhood-friendly speed and blazing silver death torpedo speed is about 1/1000 of a degree on the accelerator. The brake pedal takes a similarly aggressive view of its function.

Spring has sprung, which means pleasant smells and what I take to be the sprouting of solar cells all over my skin, since I feel so much more energetic, despite early awakenings to the sound of tweeting birds. This is not a bad way to wake up.

The next project, now that Bicycle and Car have been finished, is to consider future employment and then to consider graduate school. Actually the next project is finding another country that feels more like home, but it's somewhat less likely to happen soon.

"event","There was going to be a Christmas update, like there was the last couple of years, but I worked on it and it just kept going, and all of the people this year acted like you would expect, so here are the highlights:

1) Saw Bradley. Watched <i>Deep Space Nine</i>. Drank.

2) Learned to fire a pistol, revolver and rifle with the help of Bradley and Trent. Hit a duck decoy at a distance of thirty yards, putting an eight-round clip into an apple-sized portion of its neck. Trent misunderstood my interest and invited me to hunt with him and any offspring who might be around next year. This was followed up with an unsolicited explanation of why the war in Iraq is not only justified but vitally important.

3) Experienced life on the edge with the remote possibility that a crazy person might show up at Trent's and Mom's house demanding to see the estate information for her recently deceased husband, a friend of Trent's. The information was not there, but it didn't matter; she is a parole-violating painkiller addict, and doesn't see things like you and I do. Fortunately she never turned up.

4) Was clung to by my niece and nephew. Made drawings and peeled potatoes with the niece; feigned interest in every toy the nephew owns.

5) Finished one <i>Castlevania</i> game and started another. Read a couple of books but I can't remember which ones.

6) Inhaled large amounts of fresh Northwest air; walked in the woods every so often.

7) Learned that my mother's electric bill alone would pay my rent, utilities, and gas for three weeks. Got back the canvas bags I gave her last year, unused.

8) Had an adult conversation with my mother for the second time ever.

I'm changing my screen name to Gaspar in honor of the book <i>Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal</i>, the best book I've read in a long time.

"event","I wish I'd been born a druid. Seriously. Either in the historical sense or the fantasy sense, I don't care. I want to live the imaginary, romanticized life that everybody assumes they had, not the tedious, difficult life they probably led. The smell, sight and texture of trees is wonderful. I feel more and more guilty every time I buy more crap to populate the space between my four walls. I want to wander in ground-hugging fog between gnarled trees, making up spirits that dwell among them and play tricks on my senses. I want to escape the American Dream and experience the essence of simplicity, life spent sleeping on a forest floor.

I'm writing this from my cubicle, by the way."

"event","Wouldn't it be great if every person in the United States carried a tiny device in his or her pocket, maybe the size of a deck of cards, which combined the functions of a cell phone, PDA, GPS node, music player and ATM card? Think of the possibilities...

Every person, no matter how young or old, has a cell phone which is uniquely his or hers. Each person, regardless of where, can call to let loved ones know he'll be late for dinner, forgot a needed report for work or school, or is stranded and needs help.

Every person could have access to an automated map of the continent. Supply your destination and a computer system, already sensing your location, could direct you with realtime voice prompts. Get lost or find yourself in danger, and the press of a button could bring help to your exact position.

Paper would become almost a thing of the past. Buy an e-ticket for a baseball game or airline flight and be recognized electronically when you pass through a gate. Go to the DMV and be personally paged based on the order in which you were detected entering. Have your salary automatically added to your account, your bills automatically deducted, even your taxes handled without your awareness or intervention.

Imagine the convenience of not having to carry cash, pocketfuls of coins, a checkbook, pen and calculator, or plastic cards. Walk into a store, fill a cart, and pass through a checkout portal without stopping. Scanners detect radio tags in merchandise and in your phone, and instantly deduct the right amount of money from your account--your only account. With the Federal Reserve and the Department of Homeland Security monitoring and logging every transaction, fraud and theft are virtually nonexistent. And advances in biometrics make you fairly safe from identity theft even if you do lose your phone.

The uses for such a device would be incalculable, and the technology to make it a reality is nearly at hand. Let's look at a day in the life of an average citizen, a twenty-something like you and me, who enjoys the convenience and simplicity of such advances. As Thoreau said, ""Simplify, simplify...""

*****

We'll start as you leave work one afternoon. Once you step into the elevator, which recognizes you, knows your habits, and descends without the need for any button-pushing, your phone lists all the messages that have been accumulating for you throughout the day. Your mother sends he love, adding that she and your father have finally moved out of their high-rise apartment block into a larger, more spacious high-rise apartment block with a great view of the rest of the city. Your sister the programmer says she finally finished a ""natural media"" painting program that can simulate the subtlety of a brushstroke to an unprecedented degree. And your best friend says he'll be out-of-town this weekend, vacationing at a colonial reenactment village. Four of five online opinion polls agreed that it was ""really quaint,"" so he's really looking forward to it.

Stepping into the grocery section of the department superstore, your phone senses its location and compiles a list of things you probably need. It relays a message from your home: The bottle of dish soap has reported that it's empty. The phone also notes that you may want oranges, since you go through 4.7 of them a week. As a savvy shopper you eschew the oranges that have a new, untested pesticide sprayed on them and side with an older, proven pesticide instead. A store scanner downloads your list and sends back a message letting you know about a special on dish soap. It's not your usual brand, but it came highly recommended from a leading consumer magazine, and you can read the article right there on your phone, if you want. It also reminds you of the store's time-saving, affordable delivery service, with the caveat that for simplicity's sake you can't choose the suppliers of things like oranges.

On the way home you get another message from your home indicating that a mousetrap has snapped in the kitchen, since you'll probably want to take care of it right away, and supplying a local exterminator's ad just in case. You realize you forgot to set the PVR to record your favorite sitcom and dial in to start it. But your house, having recognized your pattern, reassures your phone that it's already recording. Relaxing, you dock the phone and decide to download your favorite band's newest album. Ever since the concepts of ""media"" and ""content ownership"" were abandoned, music is up to 10% cheaper, and you can always delete older albums for space and buy the right to hear them again later if you so choose. As you drive dynamically updating billboards greet you personally, asking if you're satisfied with the topical itch ointment you bought, offering a great line of credit on that furniture set you were looking at, and speculating that you might look happier in a new luxury SUV.

Once home you watch your sitcom, the one about the sexual antics of a group of friends who all live together. After that you decide on a long, hot shower, but in the middle the water cuts out: A new city mandage has limited showers to lengths of eight minutes. And, your shower reminds you, you have a spreadsheet to finish for work tomorrow. By the time you get to your computer the spreadsheet is already open. You finish off the evening by reading multiple online reviews of the new Jerry Bruckheimer movie, vowing to see it this weekend.

When you wake up and hit the bathroom your phone communicates with your toilet. Based on your pattern to date, the time you've spent sitting, and what you've been ordering for lunch and dinner recently, the phone asks if you're constipated and recommends a popular stool softener. You're cross when you get to work because an automated police scanner saw you speeding, downloaded information from your car's speedometer and maintenance record, concluded it was deliberate, and automatically deducted your fine. But with the notice comes an abstract of a science magazine article saying automated cars are about to begin testing, thereby increasing safety and allowing passengers to enjoy themselves, and the abstract ends with an offer for a reduced-rate subscription.

For lunch you scroll through a list on your phone of your favorite restaurants, ranked for you by how often you eat at each one. Preferring something new you choose he ""show local restaurants"" option, specify a range of two miles, and select a steakhouse with a nice, colorful ad. Your phone shows you its complete menu, you preorder a sirloin, but the phone cautions that you've been ordering too many fatty foods recently and recommends the baked potato, newly back in fashion after the last diet fad. It also communicates with your scale at home and prepares a graph of your weight fluctuations over the last five years, then points out a nearby health club with lots of rowing machines, since its built-in pedometer says you haven't walked enough recently. Around you, a symphony of beeps tells you your coworkers are all choosing their lunches, but you don't make plans with any of them because if you want to talk, you can call them any time.

You grudgingly agree to your phone's suggestions and ask it to find another match for you in the online personals and set up a meeting time, since your last date didn't lead to a relationship. Noting the connection between its suggestions and your requests, it downloads a list of five handy tips from psychology and self-help experts to improve your self-image. Tip #1: Buy a new, color-coordinated jogging suit.

Your potato is ready as you arrive. UV warnings are flashed on your phone when you approach a stool by a window, so you sit in the corner instead. Nobody pays attention; they're all talking to other people, some of them in other restaurants, none of them in this one. You had already planned, though, on calling a friend in the hospital. He was injured when he failed to notice a stoplight. Good news--the hospital database says his surgery went well, he's currently awake, the hospital floral shop has his preferred flowers in stock, and he's updated his online ""wish list"" with a major virtual retailer so you can select a gift for delivery to comfort him. Unfortunately his top choice got low satisfaction ratings from previous buyers, so you gamble on a discounted retailer suggestion and finally decide to send a text message: ""DID U LIKE? LUV UR PAL.""

You finish with a game of virtual solitaire, with graphics newly updated and more realistic than ever to take advantage of the upgraded features of your shiny, new-model phone.

The best part is, all of this technology exists or is being tested; all it lacks is the infrastructure and a desire by the populace to embrace it unquestioningly. Let your money speak: Buy all of the products that will help us build a better lifestyle tomorrow."

"event","Yesterday I answered Bradley's five survey questions, the fifth falling just as the library was closing. Here is a more thought-out and complete answer, as indicated.

<b>5) As a fellow Luddite, what technologies would you keep and what would you throw away? Explain.</b>

First a list of throwaways. Some are technology, some are a product or perversion of technology:

1) Soda pop. 200 calories a can and no nutritional value. The human body just wasn't designed to process sugar this way. People don't seem to realize that sugar, calories and fat are just different stages of the same thing. Did you know only 1% of hominid fossils show signs of tooth decay?

2) Fast food. Everybody in the world should read <i>Fast Food Nation</i>, a book which illustrates not only how fast food is bad for you but how it has reshaped the American economy and landscape and how it contributes to problems like minority poverty and corporate liability-dodging. I can't wait to find a copy of <i>Super Size Me</i>, a documentary by a man who ate only McDonald's, three meals a day for a month. He gained over 30 pounds, had problems with vomiting, low energy, and mood swings, and his doctor confused his liver with that of a 50 year-old alcoholic.

3) Refined and processed foods in general. I'm not clear how washing and bleaching rice makes it healthier, how adding preservatives doesn't suck out flavor, and why anybody in the world eats Kraft singles. Lots of studies have built up a trove of at least circumstancial evidence that heavily processed foods have much lower nutritional value, meaning people must eat much more, and that they take away more energy than they give.

4) Cell phones. Not much to say that hasn't been said before.

5) RFID tages. The scariest new way for you to be tracked in the name of homeland security and to be targetted by advertisers.

6) Broadband internet. Studies show people get less done on broadband than dial-up because people just sit and look at shit instead of doing what they need to do and then moving along.

7) Cable and satellite television. How about reading a book, going for a walk, or hanging out with a friend? Network television is even lamer; <i>Friends</i> is proof of just how little corporate America thinks of people, and its ratings seem to bear out those conclusions.

8) Microwaves. There are reasons why food tastes better when it's prepared the right way. Microwaves are good for making popcorn or melting butter, and that's about it.

9) Microsoft. My feelings on this subject are well-documented, but Microsoft to me is proof of what can go wrong when a company gets too big.

10) SUV's. I. Do not. Understand. Why people. Buy SUV's. Highly polluting, in general no real interior space advantage, rollover risk negates any safety benefits. If you need something more than a sedan, you better have two kids and two dogs, and you better buy a minivan.

11) Small, yappy dogs. Since all dogs are the result of selective breeding of Middle Eastern wolves, this counts...barely.

12) Reliance on coal and nuclear. I know it will be difficult to get off of coal and nuclear, but our power output seems almost like a solution in search of a problem. It isn't that hard to not use too much power. Use good windows and insulation. Turn off lights and appliances you aren't using. Use a blanket or a fan to control your temperature. Take one of the suggestions above instead of watching TV. There are also some increasingly easy ways to get partially ""off the grid""--the solar heat generators I mentioned once before, seen in Scientific American--250 watts from one $250 generator. The most promising of all is natural methane. I've read of a midwest farm where the offal from 400 cattle easily powers 80 local homes.

13) Cars. Don't get me wrong, I am beginning to see the appeal of driving. But most people do it about 300% more than they need. Walking is such a basic natural exercise that I'm amazed people will drive to McDonald's ten blocks away and then futilely try to find ""the diet program for me.""

14) E-mail. Impersonal and prone to misunderstanding. Lacks the elegance of writing or conversation. Like I said, SASE's for everybody. When I want to get really pretentious I'll get myself a seal and literally stamp all of my correspondence--with wax.

15) Semi-automatic hunting rifles. For drunken losers only.

16) Subdivisions. Buildings used to be designed to last hundreds of years and have their own names, like Shoscomb Olde Place. Now they're expected to be torn down in 20 years to be replaced by a strip mall or a new subdivision. Why a person would sacrifice having green land and visible trees to move into a building that's identical to 300 other nearby buildings is utterly beyond me. What's more, and I'm sorry to invoke an old rant, but do we really think the trees we use to build them are always going to be there? Brick and mortar should be used as much as possible. It's more expensive, but it lasts longer and is more energy efficient when done right. And it's the epitome of renewable.

17) Public water. Is this really necessary in all locations? In a subdivision, yes, but where I grew up we got by great with a well and septic tank. In fact, the water tasted better.

18) Formaldehyde. Nothing better for an ecosystem than thousands of dead bodies that refuse to decay because they're loaded up with unnatural chemicals. One more time, bury me unpreserved in nothing more than a canvas shroud.

*****

That's all I can think of at the moment. Here's a list of technologies that can stay:

1) DVD's. Most TV sucks, but the good stuff inevitably comes to DVD. Fewer movies suck and they can be had in pristine format.

2) Video games. This is iffy--I love them but, as my recent experiences with Castlevania and Baldur's Gate have shown, there can be too much of a good thing.

3) Word processing. This is an example of a genuinely useful evolution of an aging technology (the typewriter) that actually make these fucking white boxes slightly worth owning.

4) Fire. The oldest technology. Fireplaces rule.

5) Telephones. Not my preferred method, but it makes it possible to communicate with Simone and my family somewhat regularly. Telephone banking isn't too shabby.

6) WETA Digital. Best use of computers ever.

7) Linux/OSS. The best of what socialism has to offer.

8) The printing press, loom, sewing machine, combine, et cetera. Duh, this is how we're clothed, fed, and informed. They're okay because they're analog. I only object to the social problems that lead Taiwanese children to go blind making money for Nike and Martha Stewart.

9) Screwguns. Another flawless evolution of a formerly tedious task.

10) The fermentation of grapes, the curdling of milk, and the leavening of dough. Food is great.

*****
That's all I can think of for those. An overall explanation or thesis, if one is needed or desired, will have to wait. I'm tired."

"event","I'm trying to be succinct but answering these as honestly as possible. Bradley posed the questions. This was HARD.

<b>1) How has your father's life and death impacted your own and your outlook?</b>

My feelings toward my father have gone through several stages since his death. For a long time I regretted the fact that we constantly butted heads, but after a while I realized that he would hold no animosity toward me now. I was an arrogant teenager and he knew that, and what's more, I figured out later that there are a lot of subtle ways that we both showed love and respect for each other.

Around my junior year at Drake I really wanted him to be there because I hadn't been that happy in years. I wanted him to see everything I was accomplishing but I didn't really regret his absence, because I could feel how much I was coming to resemble him, and so every little accomplishment was kind of a mini-tribute to the memory of his hard work and energy.

A year or so later I went into a lengthy depression and wished that he could be there because I had a feeling he'd had similar feelings at some point and wanted to know how he got past them. It definitely was a depression, but it's easier to call it an identity crisis. I wanted him to tell me who I was, what I have to contribute and why somebody should love me.

When I started to get out of that depression, some things my mother said made me realize something I'd never been willing to see: my father was actually a very insecure man. He had no idea why anybody should love him or what he had to contribute, and it was difficult for him to take chances. It isn't that he didn't work hard, because he worked harder than anybody I know. But he was afraid to fail.

That's me. The tail end of that depression was an eerie suspicion that I was turning into my father, for better or worse, that I was somehow bound by his example. Now I know that was ridiculous. Even saying ""I'm insecure"" doesn't begin to define me as a person. It is difficult for me to take chances, and I am afraid to fail. But I know that I am who I <i>say</i> I am, and that's something I've never known before. The pride I have in myself is real for the first time.

<b>2) Explain, in two haikus (5-7-5) how Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is the pinnacle of all human achievement.</b>

Characters dictate
the outcome of the story,
not lame stunts for sweeps

Nothing will ever
be sweeter than Defiant
ruining some shit

<b>3) Why do you continue to work for the chocolate store?</b>

The basic reason is that it's easy. Working at Windsor Heights is low-stress, offers all the alone time I need, allows me to read and play Gameboy a LOT, and I don't even have to get up early.

But with a nod to your question/my answer above, the real reason is that I still have some insecurity left. I got tired of making mistakes, which for me included Drake and the theatre program, and haven't felt like taking any chances for a while. I know what my strengths are as a person and I know that I willprobably be incredibly good at whatever I choose to do. But it will take time, not because it has to, but because I want it to.

<b>4) What keeps you interested in Amy?</b>

Revised answer: I don't want to leave the impression that I talk about this much anymore, but what you're saying is true. I don't really know. Some things just are.

<b>5) As a fellow Luddite, what technologies would you keep and what would you throw away? Explain.</b>

Most of them. This is too small a forum to come across as anything but a rant, but here goes. America was founded on good ideas by people who were just that--people. They tried to prepare for the future, going so far as to ensure a free market for all people to start and nurture businesses as far as their industriousness would carry them. What they didn't realize was that those businesses would grow to be corporations and that those corporations would eventually have most or all of the power. Every day we are bombarded by advertising designed to convince us of the things we need, the way we should live, what we should feel insecure about, and how their products can help us be just like everybody else. That is absolutely sad, because it's amazing how well you can live without most of them, and how detrimental they are to your health.

Ours is a nation of people who are overweight because they choose to eat fast food and watch Seinfeld. They choose to drive everywhere more than a block away and talk on their cell phones about their uninteresting lives (and talk on their livejournals about how things should be different).

So far I'm without television and without easy internet access, and I'm thinking of giving up having an email address. In fact, when I do, everybody who wants one gets a half-dozen self-addressed, stamped envelopes as a substitute form of communication. I think everybody should get rid of their cell phones, cable boxes, broadband internet, and the like, but those things are common complaints and my more specific ones would include things like not preserving dead bodies. I want to rot in the ground and fertilize plants, not release more chemicals into soil that doesn't need it.

The library's about to close. My goal as an adult, far beyond any I have for my career, is to live in a house that uses wind and solar power as much as possible, has a well and a septic tank to recycle ground water, has compost bins and a vegetable and herb garden, has one car and one telephone, and has no internet access. Maybe not even a computer, if I can get by without word processing. My kids won't get their own TV's or cell phones, not even pagers. We'll do our own expansion and repairs. Yes, if all goes as it is now, I'll still have to unwind with my video games. We all need our useless hobbies.

Really have to go. I may edit this particular answer.
---------
THE RULES:
1 - Leave a comment, saying you want to be interviewed.
2 - I will respond; I'll ask you five questions.
3 - You'll update your journal with my five questions, and your five answers.

"event","Last night I did something new: got so drunk I can't remember most of the evening. Apparently I had several more than I remember, insisted on taking a couple hits off a blunt that was being passed around, and fell down the stairs to call Ralph on the big white phone.

This morning as SOON as I got to work there were people waiting for me who wanted to sit down for coffee. For two and a half hours. Missionaries on their way to South Africa. One of them tried to explain to another that while ""dark European roast"" usually implies bitter, ours was really a full-bodied coffee. He and his wife had just moved from Holland, and you know how I love those Dutchies. I huddled in the back until I had to heave, then had to walk past them looking like nothing was wrong and try not to let any puking noises escape the bathroom. Now I feel better."

"event","The trip home for Christmas break began in Wilsonville, near Portland, at Mary's and Adam's new house. It's spacious and neat, with a spooky filbert grove over the back fence that takes on eerie qualities on misty mornings, but it all drives home what I'd always suspected about the two of them: that they are completely and painfully normal.

The first clue was the china hutch, which registered in my mind only as ""obstacle"" until Adam asked me to avoid toppling it while playing with the dogs. It's the kind of beautiful cherry design I'll probably really like when I'm 45--not 24, like Adam, or 22, which Mary barely is. But it nicely compliments the new table that is used only for company and holidays.

Next was the framed Winnie-the-Pooh illustrations and basket of fruity soaps and fragrant lotions in the guest bathroom. If I ever invite you to my house, and you still don't feel welcome, a basket of fruity soaps and fragrant lotions isn't going to win you over.

The final, crushing blow was when I asked Adam about their house's John Malkovich door, a little portal of unknown purpose, accessible only by a ladder set up in the entryway, and he got embarassed that people could see the door to his attic. He spoke harsh words about covering it over. Really, I don't think I could live in a house without a John Malkovich door. It's what separates us from the barbarians. Tommy has the best I've ever seen; mine only leads to plumbing.

I think if a house is functional and tidy, you've done your job. I don't understand the preoccupation with arranging your house to impress other people with how accomodating you are or how well you live. A china hutch will not change my opinion of you, and if its absence in my home unnerves you, fine, get a life. I don't mean to pick on my favorite sister, it was just jarring to see how normal she is. She still rules.

The last time Lisa, Dan, Natalie, Sam and I saw each other was at Mary's and Adam's wedding, and now there's a new member of the family. Alia was born on December 22nd and spent most of her time sleeping inconspicuously when we met in Enumclaw. Alia, it was obvious to us all, will be quite different from Sam and Natalie, a quieter and more withdrawn person, as third children often and mysteriously are. Who knows, maybe she'll write goth poetry.

At one point I opened a cupboard in search of a glass and found 50 odd spices in the mightiest rack I've ever seen this side of Pamela Anne Gordon. Dan said ""Yeah, we're a little low, I should restock."" Seriously.

Thanks to a shared interest in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, video games and Tinker Toys, I inadvertantly became Sam's and Natalie's best friend for the weekend. They insisted I play <i>Prince of Persia</i> and <i>Zelda</i> with them and judged the success of their spool-and-dowel robots against the width of my smile. When Dan wanted to watch <i>Best in Show</i> (GREAT movie), Sam sat next to me, under my arm, and kept leaning in for hugs. When we left they said they wished I could be part of their family. ""But I am part of your family!"" ""NO! Our REAL family!""

I don't think Dan and Lisa show enough consistency in their discipline, but I respect that they don't hide anything from their kids about how the world works. When Sam was playing <i>Call of Duty</i> or some such war sim I saw his crosshairs linger on a comrade. I said ""Sam, you don't want to shoot him."" He said ""I won't shoot him, he's a good guy."" Sam just turned four.

After that I stayed with mom and Trent. As many of you know, I have a great long-distance relationship with them but tend to insulate myself with books and Gameboys when visiting. I gave Trent an Ella Fitzgerald and a Louis Armstrong CD, and he loved them. He was positively energized when we listed to them over dinner. Then he ruined it by saying ""You know, this is from a time when black people didn't think of themselves as anything but negroes. There wasn't any of the anger, any of the dividing society into us and them, blacks versus whites.""

My arguments with my mother tend to go rather worse, if you can believe it. Trent is full of subjective opinions; Mom has the full range of Rush Limbaugh's carefully researched, factual analyses at her disposal. One thing I never would have learned on my own, for example, is that we don't need to worry at all about pollution, because volcanoes spew out millions of times more pollution than we ever could, and have been for billions of years. Presumably the pollutants they spit out are the same complex molecules we put into our propellants, pesticides and Twinkies, and it won't matter that those compounds basically won't break down at all ever.

During a lengthy car ride my mother painted her own masterpiece of circular arguments and used the broadest brush I've ever seen. It started when I tried to explain open source software to her.

<b>(Begin tedious explanation)</b>

I'm a little out of my element here, but OSS is a model for distribution based on the idea that information and access to information should be free. When you download OSS you get not only the program but also the source code--the guts of the program--so you can see how it works and ferret out bugs and security holes. OSS is free to get and use; the only stipulation is that if you share or modify and redistribute it you must include your source code and charge nothing. OSS works because it has grown into a cottage industry of like-minded programmers who check each other's work in their off time and are paid, simply, in respect. The only companies making money off of OSS are doing so by bundling their own original programs or by charging for the media or their own service and support plans, meaning OSS has a total cost of maybe a tenth of the upfront cost of buying from Microsoft, a company which, I explained, is evil.

<b>(End tedious explanation)</b>

Mom positively bridled at this apparently pinko suggestion. ""Oh, no, no, no, no, no, you have to follow a commercial model. Unless the goal of profitability is present, there's no incentive to maintain and support a good product."" I said ""The source code is how accountability is maintained. Microsoft doesn't believe in competition. Most of its money goes to eliminating the chance that customers will learn that there are any alternatives, not into ensuring that their products actually meet anybody's needs. It takes advantage of the fact that people are dumb and gullible to tell them what to think.""

""Yes, she said, and that's right and proper because it follows the rules and logic of free commerce.""

Later she ranted about the liberally bieased news media. Her argument: It's sick and disgusting that the news media can't refrain from adding their own opinions to straight-up facts, as the news was presented in her youth. My argument: research anything and you'll notice or be taught that every sentence, written or spoken, carries an opinion on the subject, conscious or unconscious, and that you learn as much by listening to how things are said as to what information is conveyed. It's a clue as to why I refer to homosexual love as ""ass sex."" My mother's parry and counter-move: ""They're taking advantage of the fact that people are dumb and gullible to tell them what to think.""

I'm going to let that sink in while I go look for some grape juice.

Obviously I'm paraphrasing, but not much. Two institutions, Microsoft and news. Both are concerned ultimately with dollars and take advantage of how dumb and gullible we all are. Can anybody tell me why one is okay and the other isn't?

The last stop was Montana to see my friend Simone for the first time in seven years. I have to say at this point that I really admire Simone and pretty much always have. She's put up with more shit in her life than anybody I've ever met, yet she remains happy and motivated. Part of that shit was a four year tour of duty in the Marines. Now she's a nontrad at U of M studying Japanese and planning to be a teacher or an interpreter for a transpacific corporation.

While I was there I caused her to love They Might Be Giants and she planted in my fertile mind the seed of an interest in Tibetan Buddhism. Who can say if it will flower and grow? I can not. I respect Buddhist ideals. It would be an interesting path to follow.

Simone reads this journal now, so let me say hello! Thank you again for letting me stay with you and for being the sort of friend whose dogged determination keeps us close over many years and a great distance. I don't think I could lose Simone if I tried, which I won't.

While on vacation I also read half of <i>Shogun</i>, a truly elaborate book, and FINALLY maxed out my character on <i>Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</i>, then took him and wailed on Dracula's head one last time (until <i>Aria of Sorrow</i>, that is). And after seeing <i>Return of the King</i> again in Montana, is it me or is Bilbo dressed like JRR Tolkien sometimes dressed? Maybe I'm recalling memories that aren't there. Around that time I read a review of ROTK that said ""Yes, it's a good movie, but let's face it, it wouldn't have been nearly as good without the battle of Minas Tirith,"" which is kind of like asking people to sober up to the fact that <i>Tora! Tora! Tora!</i> wouldn't have been nearly as good without the attack on Pearl Harbor.

One more story: I went to Tommy's and Audrey's last night for some Dungeons and Dragons. My character, Sovereign, a druidic elf, has a white-furred tiger named Rafnagaud as a travelling companion. Tommy patiently explained that Rafnagaud couldn't have helmet-mounted lasers after he rolled his stats, but even without them he has proven immensely powerful and valuable in combat. This and other factors contribute to my growing suspicion that tigers are awesome, perhaps as much so as sea turtles and humpback whales.

Last night I abruptly got it into my head and immediately voiced the opinion that ""It would be totally sweet if Rafnagaud could do roundhouse kicks."" Tommy just laughed and said we apparently have different images of what tiger anatomy is capable of. Then, a little while later, he figured out a way it could be done. A ninth level druid casts ""Animal Awaken,"" then my newly-sentient tiger chooses to be a monk, since monks fight using martial arts rather than weapons.

I can't wait to play with more gaming groups. ""Your tiger can do what?"""

It hinges on one point, but it explains everything--why Trent is a misogynistic, racist, self-important bonehead and why Mom not only puts up with it but appears devoted to upholding his behavior as proper and justified. You see, Trent seems to think he's Charleton Heston, and Mom must have had a huge crush on Charleton Heston when she was in high school, so now she gets to live out her fantasy of making Charleton Heston's meals and cleaning up after Charleton Heston every morning and evening and doing all of Charleton Heston's paperwork and helping Charleton Heston find his socks and pretending (I hope) to agree with all of Charleton Heston's lame-ass complaints about how things used to be.

"event","<i>The Last Samurai</i> is basically <i>Braveheart</i> if William Wallace had started out on the wrong side. It differs in that the protagonist, Tom Cruise, is a tortured soul who is looking for peace from his part in the US Army's slaughter of innocent American indians. He finds that peace in the village of a samurai, the last of his kind, one of a band of noble warriors sworn to protect the emperor of Japan and his subjects--in this case, from the influences of greed and modernization.

What makes it not work is the combination of Tom Cruise and tortured soul. Tom Cruise's acting consists, from what I can tell, of the elaborate juggling of four brow-furrowed looks: pensive, tormented, forlorn and determined. Notwithstanding his excellent work in <i>Minority Report</i>, this lack of depth to the lead character gives the movie an emotionally manipulative quality. Compounding that is the fact that the opposing army is a band of frightened, tiny young men, and it's hard to overlook the samurai's hardcore slaughter of them, however often he comments on the beauty of lotus blossoms.

Except for screwing up the lead character, though, the movie is well-balanced, to the point that you can see the gears turning in the writers' minds as they turn out <b>Plot Device A: Protagonist finds a native love interest</b> and <b>Plot Device B: That dude Tom Cruise killed? Yeah, that was Plot Device A's husband.</b> But the battle sequences are good old fashioned, melee swordfighting, and there's a sweet ninja attack that comes pretty much out of nowhere. You'd think ninjas would be too much of a B-movie staple to use in a high-profile movie, but no, they're there, armed with stars, crossbows, triplines, swords and knives, and thirty of them show up in the night to try and settle the samurai's hash. Way kickass.

"event","People have weird little sayings that they live by, like ""Look out for number one,"" ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease,"" and ""Dignity and an empty sack is worth the sack,"" and I've decided that mine is going to be ""When in doubt, whip the bejesus out of the undead hordes until you level up, then whip them some more,"" because it's worked out so well in <i>Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</i>. Every time you open up a new area you find new, harder enemies with more complex patterns, and usually it's best to go find a short stretch of familiar beasts and gain XP until you have more strength and defense, a la <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>.

I'm sure in the future my sensible mantra will be truncated to ""When in doubt, whip the undead hordes,"" but no matter. The real problem is that it's hard to find Dracula's foul minions stalking the cold earth in this more enlightened day and age. I'm sure that's part of the ""good old fashioned American values"" that Iowans always blather about but never quite nail down exactly--that we don't still for undead hordes. If an Iowan saw a werefolf skulking in the azaleas or a zombie eating his daughter's brain, he'd probably complain straightaway to the neighborhood association about his property values falling like so many stones and then tell the town council it was time to do some serious thinking about the children. A subcommittee would be formed, some environmental studies would be commissioned, and citizens would do their part by planting signs in the barkdust by the front walk saying things like ""Just say NO to lycanthropy,"" ""FISH is brain food, not BRAINS,"" ""Undead? Unwelcome"" and the perennial favorite, ""Thinking about sucking blood? Iowa votes for KIDS!"" At the moment it's ""Thinking of running for president?"" but it works for anything--""Thinking of turning into a mysterious fog by the moonlight and enrapturing beautiful young women? Iowa votes for KIDS!"" 

Even if the undead were welcomed into our picturesque community, and I'm not saying they should be without careful acclimation, they'd only be employed as gardeners and roof builders. They'd have it worse than most minorities, because I'm pretty sure the idea of an undead restaurant wouldn't fly. I mean, can you imagine a brain-shaped menu highlighting Uncooked Neck of Child and a Blood List capped off by an Extra Dry Romanian '88? Okay, yeah, so can I, and the jewel-encrusted goblets would be pretty sweet, and maybe a moldy Boris Karloff could ask if you wanted festering or non-festering, but we're talking about some serious zoning problems here, and Iowans don't sit still for that either. And that amounts to a shocking absence of undead hordes. If Americans, and by ""Americans"" I mean ""Iowans,"" don't start practicing the equality and diversity that we preach, it is we who shall suffer, for we shan't have the opportunity to whip the undead and know the joy and satisfaction of levelling up. I can think of no sadder irony."

"event","Last night I saw something sad, but really beautiful.

My friend Jolie has a few local bands she always goes to see if she can help it, and she invites me and anybody else who's interested. Some of them I don't like all that much. Ashante is a Latin jazz band, for lack of a better term, and although they're talented musicians, it just isn't my cup of tea. On the other hand, the last time we saw them it was at Somerset winery on the very last warm day in October. Just fifty or so people, sitting on a grassy hill in a warm breeze, surrounded by trees in various shades of yellow and red. I haven't been that relaxed in a long time.

One of the groups I do understand is Bob and Gary. These are a couple of older guys who play the acoustic guitar and electric guitar, respectively, and the best name I can come up with for their style is ""folksy"". Not like Arkansas folksy or <i>Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?</i> folksy, but for example, one of the famous songs they play is ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"" and they play it well. Some of the other ones I like are ""Wings,"" about giving freedom to the things you love (there's a verse about a lion in a zoo...""What's the use of having strength if you never get to run?"") and ""Fairy Story,"" about a knight who does brave deeds and is offered both of the king's daughters--but ends up staying the night with the king, ""'cause this is a fairy story.""

Last night was my third time seeing them, in a Coffee Merchant way out West on Merle Hay, and everything they played was great. Gary kind of recedes into the background because Bob does virtually all of the singing and the more powerful music, but they make a good team. Bob himself is kind of like Bob Ross. Friendly, gentle, but also like a really caring grandfather.

Bob spent the entire night taking requests but he had to refuse a few because his hands were getting pretty stiff and sore. He also missed small pieces of lyrics quite a few times--in ways obvious enough for me to notice, having seen them only twice before--and Jolie commented that she'd noticed a lot more than I had. 

Bob is one of those few musicians who can hold you rapt not just with his music, but with his presence. He's a nice, caring person. He's also at peace with himself. If he <i>were</i> your grandfather you would automatically seek him out any time there was something very wrong and you didn't know what to do. His last song of the night was about ways of showing love for other people, and it gradually wrapped into a declaration that he was showing his by creating music for all of us. I damn near cried; he's not going to be doing it much longer.

The entire night I sat behind an elderly couple with their chairs close together. Most of the time the husband sat with his arm around her shoulders, and sometimes they were holding hands. It's not a big secret that I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. Every time I see an older couple sitting in a park, holding hands, or something like that, I just have to stop, because I can't stop thinking about how long and happy a life they must have had to be able to just sit there together and be so happy. Every once in a while he'd lean over and say something in her ear. He'd lean over until the bridge of his nose was just touching her, then turn his face so his cheek was against her hair, and start whispering softly. It was a familiar touch for them both. It was comfortable. They were still in love.

By the end of the last song, nobody in the room could focus on anything but the two men sitting at the front with their guitars and microphones. Bob Cook probably doesn't have a lot of years left in him, but I'm glad I got to see him again, and to see those very content people around him."

"event","Something I've been thinking a lot about lately is the extent to which we create our own reality.

As with most things I write seriously about, it's been on my mind a while, and this journal entry about it has been written numerous times in my head and will probably go in another random direction anyway. But it's worth thinking about, for me, because of how the last year or year-and-a-half has gone.

This particular thought started this summer when I approached an old friend to help me figure out the Megan situation. And it seemed like a situation at the time. The short version: Megan turned up at a time when I was just getting over a period of being very angry and despondent. She was trying to get out of a relationship that wasn't going anywhere but subservience, and so for a few months we both took comfort in the idea that we would have a great thing once we both got over our problems. When I thought the time was right, I brought it up again, she did a huge about-face, cut off all emotional intimacy, and when I backed off too, accused me of being a bad friend.

I related all of this and said I seemed to have been in this situation once or twice before and couldn't keep up when the rules apparently changed. Angie, who is legendary for making your thoughts screech to a halt, told me I changed the rules by pushing the relationship issue, so I damn well shouldn't be surprised. Even though I was perfectly justified, I set that series of events into motion.

""So what did I do wrong?"" I asked. Turns out I didn't do anything wrong. It's all a matter of perspective, of course of course, and Megan might see things differently, but there was never going to be a relationship. She needed comfort, somebody to tell her what a great person she is when everybody else seemed to be against her, and I suppose I did too. So I can't blame her for deciding not to be in a relationship with me. What I can blame her for is trying to pin the fallout on me.

At this point it doesn't matter. I overrated Megan, but not enough that it effects my daily life a few months later. I saw her at Wal-Mart last night and felt an emotion something like distaste, something like apathy.

What does matter is the ultimate effect that it had on me. Thanks to my own inherited personality, anything which isn't a success is naturally a failure, and my own already low self-image sank even deeper. The Megan situation was just the tip of the proverbial iceberg, and the giant, fuzzy mass of it, lurking beneath the surface, was the Amy situation, which I won't even go into. But Megan took a bad situation and made it worse, and despite knowing most of my melodramatic past, is still unaware how much she hurt me.

Water under the bridge. But this summer was bad. Within the same year I had attempted to excise myself from Amy and the theatre department. However unhealthy those things are for me, they were familiar, and my lifestyle and my estimate of myself changed accordingly. At the same time I was transitioning into whoever I will be after college. Indeed, that is the person I nearly am now. I got to experience the liberal arts major panic of looking for a job in the real world, where applying post-structuralist thinking to classical mythology isn't likely to put bread on your table. And all of this was magnified by a desperate desire to be able to talk to my dad, from whom I inherited my self-critical nature. There are a lot of weird little parallels between him and me, things only I might pick up on, and I have to imagine that at some point in his life he went through the same lows I did. I can't begin to describe how important it was for me to be able to see him, to hold him, to tell him I always loved him, and to ask how he dealt with feelings like those. It's not something I have the skill to put into words. If you've been there, you've been there.

What I'm trying to do is explain how I got where I did. Everybody has to deal with stupid problems like these, but in case it wasn't obvious to those close to me (however close they get), I spent a couple of months thinking about ending my life. I never had to pull myself back from the edge while the knife hovered over my wrist, but I did have to ask myself what effect it would have on my mother just so I could break my focus on it. I cried myself to sleep most nights. I despaired at the knowledge that the day to come would be exactly like the day it followed. And yes, cutting my wrists is exactly the method I would use.

That period is passed now. I need to make that absolutely clear--inexplicably, I've gotten happier. I chalk it up to the normal swing of emotions. Normal for me, anyway. Or maybe I just like to think of myself as intense and brooding. But I can say with certainty that while I hated my life, I never hated myself. That's probably what made the difference. I'm confident in my values and the decisions I base on them. It was just a question of not understanding how I still managed to screw up so many potentially good opportunities. What can I say, I fucked up. The answers will probably come sooner or later.

As for my dad, well, that comes and goes. A person I care a lot about recently lost somebody, a similar situation. Soon after I learned that, I started carrying an old tracheotomy knife that belonged to my dad. It's really a trinket, nothing that was important to him, but it's important to me because it's something he used with his hands. He was creative, disciplined, organized, meticulous and patient. But in spite of his intelligence, for some reason I remember him in terms of his hands. His life was the things that he did with his hands. Fixing things--people and cars. 

Having seen how my mother has changed through and between two husbands, I'm pretty sure I get most of who I am from my father. The point: Even though I can't talk to him, I take some consolation, as well as a great deal of pride, in the knowledge that my dad lives on in me. In the things I create, or fix. Here's a secret: I'd really like to have a son, and I'd really like to tell him about all the beautiful things in the world, and what a great guy his grandfather was, and how I learned through him that life is pretty much what you make of it.

Oh yeah, that's where all this was going. The next step was seeing all the facades (my term) around me. Apparently I ask people a lot of probing questions if I'm not careful and they don't tell me not to. If I wanted to justify those questions, I'd say I'm just trying to get past the bullshit. Everybody seems to have a side they show the world, and then the person they really are. That's normal and natural, as any person trained in psychology would tell you right before he explained the surf and turf platter. But when I meet somebody who interests me, I think it's because I sense a beautiful, intrigueing person inside, and I want to skip right past the facade. Like I said, facades (or whatever they're called) are a normal defense. Mine got huge in the last year when I didn't want anybody to get close to me, lest I get hurt again.

But so many people put so much emphasis on the side they show the world. I love Amy, but her entire existence is spent creating an illusion that she wants people to see, to the exclusion of actually enjoying anything. The same goes for Reever and a host of other people. I'm not qualified to say there's anything wrong with that. But when you create an illusion for the benefit of others, you do run the risk of letting that become your reality. And if anybody gets past that illusion, oh man, you could really get hurt. 

Ugh...It's hard to say more without mentioning other specific people. Since I'm not writing a thesis, that's all you get.

Finally....well, it's hard to put into words. But I'm becoming more aware of how tenuous law and order are. Do you know what Stalin did to Trotsky? He usurped the inherited power of Lenin from him, expelled him from the inner council of the Communist party, expelled him from the Communist party, exiled him from Russia, and then had him killed in Mexico, all within five years. Over the next twenty he would go on to kill over thirty million other people. How does somebody just do that?

Do you know what the Russian people, by and large, did when the Soviet Union collapsed? Nothing. They were so attuned to the idea that there would be a power to take care of them without their input that they just waited to be taken care of some more. Societies function not to promote values, but to perpetuate themselves. They aren't institutions, they're more like organic beings. When push comes to shove, they'll do what it takes to survive.

Values are arbitrary. The fact that Americans have decided that cigarettes and kids don't mix doesn't stop Phillip Morris from passing out cigarettes at grade schools in Turkey. I learned that today. If you reacted with horror, ask yourself why we decided it's okay for eighteen year-olds to smoke if they choose to, but not twelve year-olds. Medical wisdom has now decided it was wrong to tell people to avoid fat for forty years--it obviously hasn't worked--because getting enough fat keeps you from being unnecessarily hungry. And a fat person who exercises regularly is now considered healthier than a skinny person who lounges. I'm just saying that meaning and knowledge are not static, and neither, therefore, are values.

I'm getting way off track, but I'm trying to say that the American values we're trying so desperately to spread to the Middle East are ultimately no better or worse than the ones already in place there. Those values we hold so dear only have meaning so long as we respect and care about them or, if necessary, fear them. What if my neighbor decides to kill somebody? In addition to slightly reducing the enormous strain on our planet, he has placed priority on his own values, which make it acceptable to kill, over those vague American values, which preach otherwise as long as it's convenient. 

In the end, the only standard by which you can judge another person's or institution's actions is your own standard. Everything else is a product of the evolution of culture, not some universal truth. This finally crystallized when I saw <i>Red Dragon</i> last week.

The thing that makes that franchise so engrossing is Hannibal Lecter. And the thing that makes him so engrossing is the choices he's made about life. By my standard, if he were a real person, he would deserve his punishment. But I can't tell you that the character of Hannibal Lecter is evil. He isn't. He didn't kill out of malice or hatred. He simply accomplished an end through a means most people wouldn't take. It was a game for him. The goal was his freedom to act as he pleased, and to get there, he would take any and every opportunity. We relate to Lecter because he's that little, primal part inside all of us that isn't constrained, that does what it really wants to do, <b>that exists only to satiate itself</b>. And if we didn't relate to him, well, the movies wouldn't be so darned popular. We are repulsed by his actions alone. But we are fascinated knowing that, even in is cell, he is free in a way that we are not.

People like Stalin and Lecter don't pop up all the time, though, because most of us are either accustomed to following the rules, or actually think they're a good idea. I happen to think it's wrong to kill, and would personally smash the testicles of every rapist with a meat tenderizer if I could. But I understand the desire for power. The power over life. It's pursuing that desire that allows some people to reshape their own reality in disgusting ways.

On the other hand, though, as much as we construct our own reality, we do construct it around fate. Meaning, we choose how we react to what we can't foresee. Here's a fun story: When I was less than a year old I went with my family to take my older sister to a doctor after she broke her arm. I had my feet curled up, which my parents had always assumed was simply a habit I'd outgrow, and was wearing sleepers that hung a foot off the ends of my toes. From across the room the doctor saw me and said ""Frank (my dad)! That baby has metatarsus varus! We have to get him in splints!"" (Metatarsus varus is an unnatural curvature of the bones of the feet.)

Do something for me. Take off your shoes and curl your feet inward as much as you can. Now walk across the room on the outer edges of your feet for as long as you can stand it. Without a truly astonishing, accidental diagnosis from Dr. Larry Cohen, that's how I would have walked for the rest of my life after my bones hardened. At the first ""knuckle"" of the smallest toe, my feet are still slightly wrong, making shoe-buying an extra chore. But hey, I can walk like nobody's business.

That's the closest I've ever been to a real handicap, but sometimes you can't help but think how your life would be different. Would people look at you with pity right before they thought ""I'm glad that isn't me""? Would you be able to find somebody who loved you? Would that person be able to be seen walking in public with you, offering you an arm and patiently waiting to get wherever while you plodded along? Would you be one of those asshole handicapped people who growl at every friendly person, or the kind who turn up on Saturday morning television and make the best of things, usually while playing with a basketball? What would you accomplish? Would you accomplish it because you cared, or because you needed to distract you and everybody else away from your disability? How would you react to what fate dealt you?

Anyway. 

I guess all of this has to go somewhere. Otherwise I'd feel like I'd failed somehow--get it? I could go buy beer and cigarettes for minors, or maybe wing somebody with a sniper rifle, but instead I choose to relate it to the last year or so. It sucked, it fucking sucked. I know my problems are only so big next to somebody else's, which is why I mostly haven't bothered you with them. And everybody experiences things like these.

Right now, though, I have no real fear about what I'm going to do at the end of the semester. I'm hardly aware that I'm a student anyway. And I'd like to fall asleep with somebody's head lying against my chest, but I'm also glad I didn't wind up in a relationship with Megan. In hindsight, she did most of the talking, and I did most of the listening. If you asked her who I am, she probably wouldn't have the faintest idea. 

Suddenly I'm not angry or afraid. It's novel. I'd actually forgotten what it was like to care about somebody, and it's happening again. Not for anybody in particular, but it's there waiting.

Maybe the reason so many people miss childhood is that when you're a kid, you're not aware of creating your own reality. There is nothing besides your reality. There are rules, but value is a meaningless concept. Grow up, and you have to align your values with somebody else's rules by constructing a reality in which you're perfectly happy being told what's right and wrong, what's good and bad, what's success and failure.

I have regrets. All of this started with a regret. A couple of years ago I screwed up, and it was a big screw-up. My self image ever since then has hung in the balance. And I didn't screw up by doing the wrong thing and acting against my better judgement. I screwed up just by being me, and that's the worst kind.

But the increasingly obvious point is, you always have the chance to address your past, if not correct it. I hope I can figure out how to do that, but if not, a sandwich would also be nice. One is just as good as the other."

"event","Margaret Bradshaw watched the morning news with a studied look of disgust. Fifty miles to the South a murder had been committed, and the details were being related as the alleged murderer was marched away before dozens of video cameras. Not wanting to believe such a thing could actually happen in this day and age, Mrs. Bradshaw crumpled the silvery wrapper from her breakfast of a low-fat cereal bar and made a sound like somebody had suddenly pushed on her abdomen.

When that failed to draw a response from her husband, she hunted around the kitchen table for the TV remote and pushed a button. The television, a nine-inch color model under a cabinet, winked off. She passed it on her way to the garbage disposal, which dealt with the remains of her daily grapefruit in its usual, noisy way, and then, for a lack of anything better to do, she sat down again.

Absently, she ran a finger around the rim of her coffee cup, an old habit. This had the combined effect of producing a barely audible squeak and smearing a dab of her lipstick even farther around the cup. After a minute, she shifted her chin on her knuckles so as to face Arthur, her husband of twenty-seven years. 

""I just don't understand how a person could do something like that,"" she said abruptly. ""I mean, what drives a person to commit murder? Arthur, would you be able to take another person's life? I sure wouldn't.""

Arthur was seated in the adjacent living room, in the one chair he had managed to keep over his wife's objections when she'd had the house redecorated the year before. He appeared, for half a second, not to have heard her, his attention being fully taken up by the newspaper unfolded on his lap. Then he brought his eyes up and looked at a nonexistent world two feet in front of his nose, through his square wireframes.

""Yes,"" he said, and lowered his eyes again.

With her morning routine completed, Mrs. Bradshaw checked her hair in the hall mirror and pulled her Mercedes keys off of a hook by the door. ""Am I capable of murder?"" she wondered fleetingly. ""How does one even know?"""

"event","Every single person in the world is potentially a murderer. But very few of us ever cross the line between what we know is moral behavior and what we suspect is momentarily, completely, utterly satisfying behavior. Most of the time it's because we've grown up being told to respect human life. Once in a while it's because we fear the consequences. Sometimes, in a far-off country, we forget the rules altogether and murder living human beings because our governments tell us they're really animals.

But every single person knows what it means to hate. To be taken aback because you've unexpectedly run into somebody who denies every idea you have of who you are. Every single person has felt reality fall away just long enough to sense, rather than see, that other person being beaten to the point of bloody unconsciousness. Every person knows what it means to somehow feel the imagined blows you deal by your own hands, taking life away in payment for everything he or she took from you. And every person has laughed long and silent at the thought of that final blow, the hand shoving the nose into the brain, or the knife sliding effortlessly across the throat. You smell the blood, you see it caked on your hands, and you laugh while you look down at the broken body that used to be a human being. Because <i>you</i> took its life away and whatever power it had over you. And for that tenth of a second, you're absolutely, completely free.

These images are a part of living. Every person has felt them, and anybody who doesn't acknowledge them isn't facing reality. Don't try to teach us that violence in any form is wrong, because you're not watching what we're doing in the Middle East. Don't try to tell us that we solve our problems with reason, because we have all the same instincts as animals, we just think they're moderated by self-awareness. Instead of teaching us to abhor and escape them, teach us to accept them and move on. Because when that moment of truth arrives, the only difference between somebody who crosses the threshold and somebody who doesn't is knowing the consequences and actually caring about them.

We all create our own reality. Mine is filled with all of the things I love and the occasional, brief, impossible but immensely satisfying image of somebody I hate in tremendous pain. But it isn't worth losing the things that I love just to escape the things I hate. If my government tells me that I must dehumanize somebody and kill him, I will do it. But I will never kill anybody out of anger. The real freedom is being able to think about it.

I'm going to go exercise intensely, then play Goldeneye. Then I'll get on with the things I love. Joseph Lieberman can lick my balls."

"event","For the first time ever, I couldn't believe what she was saying. I was reacting on an instinctive level, not relying on facts as I try to do. She couldn't look at me, and she didn't act surprised at what I was saying. She never asked ""Why would he say that,"" or ""How could you believe him?"" She just growled ""He's lying"" as she soft-focused on a root jutting up at her feet.  But what she was saying meant nothing to me.

I'll never know who was lying to me. Later he told me I was a perceptive person because I was smart enough or not blinded enough to notice those things. And he gave a much better explanation for why she would lie than she could give for him. But I'll never know for sure, even if she'll forgive me for all the times I've hurt her back.

After the argument I started to pick up new ways of managing my emotions. I've known about these ways for a long time because I've seen them work for other people. It used to be that out of a given week, one or two days would be really good, one or two would be very bad, and the rest would be a zombie-like shuffle from one obligation to the next. To improve those numbers you have to realize what's important. Then you have to switch off whatever hurt is left over.

Talking with him gave me a reason to hate. Hatred had never seemed justified but now a whole new perspective was open to me. Whenever I would see her and feel sorrow, whenever she would look at her new companion with admiration and, who knows, love, I could remember that I was superior. Superior in contentedness, superior in self-control, superior in honesty. People called me dark and brooding and I loved that. But what they may never have realized was that this was less of an act than I normally put up, not more. And the numbers were improving.

I had found a glimpse of who I really am, and what is really important to me. And then, not in a moment of weakness but one of indifference, I tried talking to her again. I tried analyzing again. If you don't ask questions you usually learn things anyway. But I asked, and felt the old ways again. It isn't worth it.

I love her. I'm in love with her. But if that doesn't mean anything to her, it won't mean anything to me. I was wrong; that isn't repression at all."

I started to write a paragraph about why I set up a Livejournal account, something about resisting the idea because people just use online journals to complain about their boring lives, but I think you can see the hypocrisy already beginning to form out of that. I don't have time to write more, because I have to go hang some lighting instruments for some ungrateful people. Hey, that was complaining."

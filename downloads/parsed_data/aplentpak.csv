"event","when life catches up to you, what do you do? is there a safe haven to hide out in until the storm passes? are there teams to help me rebuild the ruins of my own life? what have i become? what does it mean when you are unrecognizable to even yourself? people change; it's a fact of life; but like this? this isn't a change...this is mid-life crisis twenty years premature. i have spent time with some people from my past, and it's made me realize how different i am now. the idea of matching up my present person with their prior person appeals to me. i feel like i've been basking in nostalgia only to realize that it's only that--nostalgia, instead of the present here and now. 
looking back at my live journal entry from two years ago (to the day) i discovered something ironic. i won't mention it, though. i feel like i'm living in a fictional world."

"event","Do I only post negative stuff now? I don't know...maybe that's all that seems interesting enough to post right now.
Yesterday we had a guest in Ruby's that owns a bar in Atlanta. he offered for melissa (one of the other bartenders) and i to come up and work like a wed, thurs, fri every now and then--make like $800 a night. that would be crazy awesome. ironic part is that melissa and i had just been sitting down talking about how much we like bartending and how we wanted to work at just a bar; instead of a restaurant <i>with</i> a bar. ruby's bar doesn't make very much b/c it's not that cool. i feel kinda bad about serving drinks, but i love making them--it's fun--and the money's definitely better. we may go up to ATL and do that next month sometime--i can't right now b/c of class, but when school's out i may do that.
i had a horrible night at work last night. it was to the point where i stormed out the backdoor fuming, and had to control myself so that i wouldn't full on bawl. i was tearing up a bit--the first time that's ever happened there. the cooks just pissed me off soooooooooo bad that i wanted to slug half of them until they couldn't cook ever again. i was ready to turn in my 2 weeks notice at the end of the night, but then i realized i don't have anywhere else to go. i may apply at longhorn to just work the bar. or i may see about transferring down to the valdosta ruby's for a little bit. i don't know, but i need to talk to my general manager and i couldn't get ahold of him last night. 
on a good note--i went out to steak and shake with ben last night. that was the first time we've hung out just the two of us. it was nice--not awkward at all. i don't know where this is all leading, and i don't want to say anything on here in case he, by some odd-odd chance, reads it.
and finally--still haven't been getting the sleep i need. i work late tonight, but i'm not going to let myself do anything after work--straight to bed for me. and i get to sleep in a bit tomorrow before i have to finalize a paper and study for an exam in my Amer. Gov't class. eek!"

"event","i am a mess!
<b>wednesday:</b> bar shift till midnight--then melissa (one of the girls i work with) and our manager, chris decided to go have drinks at locos--one of only two ""bars"" open past 11pm on weeknights. i know, i know--i don't drink. but it was fun. i had one drink...count them--ONE. it was called a royal flush and had cranberry juice, orange juice, and crown royal. it was actually pretty good. my friend matt saw my car and came over too. it was just relaxing and good conversation. nothing out of control. then matt and i went to waffle house. i didn't go to bed till like 3:30am
<b>thursday:</b> lost my voice to the point that every third word was either silent or 3 pitches higher than normal. went to my college group--couldn't sing along with worship very well. stopped by ruby's on my way to starbucks and met up with some of my friends/guests. we decided to meet up at locos after i went to starbucks for a bit. so me, ben, josh, chris, and matt met up there. more people that night--met sophie (works with the guys); some of their co-workers were there and were completely drunk (sohie wasn't drunk). they happen to work at Target where tim (my brother) works. anyway...i had two drinks that night--i didn't care for either. from there we went to City Limits (the other bar still open) and played pool--no drinkin' there. then off to waffle house. ben and i had really hit it off (i hadn't hung out with him before)--he paid for my waffle. lol. went home--ben and i texted till 4:45am, at which time he called me. talked till 6:30am--then i had to get ready to go to class. we talked for another 1 1/2 after i got ready and was driving down to valdosta--so i didn't sleep at all that night.
<b>friday:</b> nap before work--only about 1 1/2 hours. still hardly any voice, and they were fully staffed at work, so i got off. ALMOST one $143 on ""Beat the Buzzer"" on the radio station, but the buzzer beat me! should have gone back to sleep, but went out to dinner with ben and chris--ben paid again. then we went to get his drums from a friend's house--a girl named ashley that just started at ruby's. hung out there for a while, set the drums up at chris's (he's going to try to learn to play). went to locos--waaaaaaaaaay too many people there. one drink--white russian. over to City limits--no drinking for me--just call me DD Traci :o/ then over to Daniel's. hung out by the pool--too cold to swim. went home at 5:30--in bed by 6:30am
<b>saturday:</b> up at 9:30am--got ready--went to lunch with adrielle and the college leader from tim and stace's church. starbucks--gave a <i>different</i> Daniel Adrielle's number. work--shift lead till after midnight. ben, josh, and chris came in to eat--talked to them for a while. was the only ""manager"" on the floor on a saturday night--craziness. had a lot of awful tables to deal with.  went over to josh's after work--ben, chris, josh, sophie, and a couple other people were there. ben played guitar for a while--pretty amazing on it, too. left around 7am. in bed by 7:15am
<b>sunday:</b> 1 1/2 hours later i got up for church. good message, blah lunch, good nap (2 1/2 hours) and off to work. really good shift up until 9pm when the proverbial $**t hit the fan. let me summarize in semi-rhyming form--vomit on the bathroom door, bucket of cucumbers on the dining room floor;  too many people in a sardine booth, the table next to them got cold soup. cooks don't know how to do their work, some servers being jerks. had to stay 2 hours more, and do someone else's cleanup chores. home at midnight--talked to ben for 10 mins, and went to bed by 12:30.
<b>today thus far</b>: running on low sleep as a result of my ""wild"" weekend. still don't have my voice completely back. coulda won $100 from the same radio station if i stopped in at chik-fil-a, but i didn't have time...despite the fact that i was at starbucks and they are directly across the street from each other. and my first class stunk! that's my week/weekend."

in other news, i have connor for the weekend, but since they didn't tell me till last minute that they needed someone, i set up other babysitters for when i'm at work. thanks, me! i feel like a little mommy with him sometimes, and i think i love him like that, too. my car is fixed (until the next problem it brings on)."

3.)wednesday one of our cooks--Jose (actually rather attractive)--asked me when i was going to let him take me out on a date. i don't date work associates.
4.)last night some slight aquaintances--Vicash and Omar--called me over to there table b/c a different Jose was ""admiring me from a distance"" and wanted to ask for my number. he was lame, and not really an agressive, so i told them i'd give them my number and put $5 down that he wouldn't call. haha. lamo..no thanks.

"event","I have found some major joys in some minor things lately. For example...
Tuesday at work, they quit playing the same station that's been on for weeks--some 80s stuff; not the good 80s, but the stuff that didn't make the cut. Anyway, in place of it, they were playing stuff like Jimmy Eat World, FallOutBoy, Jack Johnson, OK Go, Keane, Snow Patrol, All American Rejects, etc. I 'bout fell over when JEW came on. I couldn't believe it. Then it just got better from there. when they played OK Go, i cracked up--i love ""Get Over It,"" but they swear in it. instead of just bleeping out the word, they just copied the line that follows it, and dubbed it over it. i was giggling up at the hostess stand.
Other things that amuse me:
^adrielle and i pranked josh to the max this weekend. we ""redecorated his room""--frozen boxers, porcelin figurines to replace the shrine of ""orange crush"" bottles, a new [severely yucky, tacky, and old] bedspread, flipped furniture, tiger-stripped curtains, faux-flowers to greet him at his door, etc.
^Connor--always a riot; even when he's bad
^phone calls from ""long lost friends""--i.e. josh steinmetz
^the cooks at work
^unexpected visits from ""lovers"" j/k
^thai food--twice in one week--i'm a master chef now
^people that don't remember things that happened b/c they were intoxicated during the fact (i just laugh at them because they're stupid for doing that) i'm mean, i know
^wearing cut up shirts that look like they're from the 80s
^realizing that the awful test you have is not in fact the next day, but a week away
^12:15--the time that my art history class ends
and i'm sure there are other things that i can't think of right now. i'm in between classes, and i need to read before my composition class."

Gas prices bite! I have to drive 4 hours a week to get to school and back, and at $3 a gallon, I'll be spending like $40 a week in gas. I do not make enough money to afford that, but I obviously have to get to school. I'm going to try to find someone that commutes like me, and maybe get a carpool going on.

Tonight is our college group--The Outlet. I really, really need it tonight. I have been falling away from God in the past 2 weeks; I feel it. I have gotten caught up in work, school, and friends, and have neglected time with Him. I am feeling the depression of it all, and it bothers me--hopefully enough that I will spend more and more time with Him. You can be praying for that, too, please."

"event","When reality sets in, it is often this eye-opening experience. It doesn't have to be fun, or exciting, or even invigorating--in fact--for me, it was much the opposite. It wasn't so long ago, and I can still picture us laying there. My eyes were open--literally--and a dawning came across my face. It was too dark in the room, though, so he couldn't see. It was probably a sort of pained expression, a realization of inadequacy. However, I don't feel inadequate--not like I thought I would. I continued to ask questions, and he even encouraged them--""we are on the pursuit of best friendom...best friends are open with each other."" But I still could not believe the ease with which he answer--as if it was common. As if this sort of thing went on all across town. Maybe it does and I'm just unaware, but it seems rather odd that this time of thing would be occuring all around me while I remain clueless. Regardless, I still questioned my motives. Why was I laying there to begin with? What was the purpose of me being there? I knew exactly why, and I knew it wasn't necessary. His eyes where closed; I could feel his heart beating; his breath was coming in slow rhythmic patterns now, that lulled me into a near dreamlike state.  I pictured myself as a chess pawn--as if he was moving both sides, yet keeping them always against each other. In that same moment, though, I saw <i>myself</i> as the chess player--I'd move one of my pawns to a defenseless position--awaiting the inevitable attack--almost yearning for it; then I would wait to see how he would react. Would he allow me to advance a step, would he block me, or would he take one of my pieces from the board? Despite...looking back, I can remember a sort of calm--as if I had less to concern myself with now. I could let him ""win,"" yet still survive with a few pawns intact.

In retrospect i feel so foolish--and I told him this. How could I have let things get this far? Sure, I kept my ""key"" discretions intact--but I faltered elsewhere. I let my guard down, and now I will have <i>this</i> with me for years to come--possibly forever. Nothing really changed that night; no miracle happened; no great revelation; but I realized something...I realized I had set up the game myself. I had put the pieces on the board and asked him to play. Sure, he was a willing participant; in fact, I knew he wanted to play even before I had asked. But I was the one that took the initiative. I had begun laying out the pieces that very first night--the night we met. It seems so long ago now. I remember it very clearly, though--the awkward glances, the desire to talk to him but no knowledge of how to approach, the eventual conversation, the comfort of his presence, then her calls. What happened after that? Why are things so far from that now? Why do I feel like I have become a different person through it all? Have I really digressed to what I once was; to what I said I would never be again? Time flew by at increased speeds; what wasn't really there seemed so obvious to others--and it disgusts me now. I am not bitter; I am not angry; I am not even melancholy--I am, however, reflective. I am learned--far greater than any book could ever teach me. I am stronger through the humility of it all. I am wiser than before, but I am also more skeptical, more fearful, and just as susceptible to the very same thing. I am prone to blunder, but I am the better for it now. I am more prepared."

I tried to take the bandaids off tonight--i wanted to see the damage--but it started to bleed through the first two bandaids before i even got the first one off, so i decided to wait on that. maybe tomorrow it will be done bleeding. Stacey thought i may need stitches, and tim said i nearly cut the tip of my thumb off. yuck! i finished making dinner, though. tim cut the rest of the squash for me.

then after dinner, we went Geocaching.
Definition:   a type of scavenger hunt for waterproof containers bearing treasure using the containers' exact geographic coordinates and Global Positioning System devices.
Basically...people hide stuff, put the coordinates (using GPS) on the Geocaching website, and then other people use the coordinates w/ GPS to go find it. Most of them are just little containers with a list to sign that you've found it. Thus the photo.

Pretty much-i have sundays off, and that's about it. unless i specifically ask for a day off, which i've only done once. cristen's looking more and more pregnant--obviously--and caleb's in mexico on a missions trip. i leave for georgia in just over 2 weeks. i'll be heading down there, fixing up my room and all that, then going down to orlando with the rest of my family for the first annual ""VanSumeren Family Vacation"". *cue the theme music,please* anyway, i'm loving the edge, and don't want to be leaving that behing--it's a college-age group, for those that don't know. my work is not as fun as it used to be--i have a guy that i have to give full body bed baths, change his diapers, and all that icky stuff--he's 95. he tried to smack my butt the other day--ew! i have a woman with the most aweful altzeimers, and various other clients. it's more rough than last summer, for sure. i've been doing some long shifts--14-27 hrs. sometimes--and don't have much time to spend with my friends. i wish i didn't have to work so that i could spend time with them, but not work me no money. i missed july 4th b/c they needed someone to work--time and a half, though, baby!!! anyway, i must be off."

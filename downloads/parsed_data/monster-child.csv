"event","Do you ever feel hoplessness and void in the pit of your stomic? Like maybe your a just a pon in somone elses game of life? Like the mith of fait..is it true? Are our lifes pre-destened? Is the reason we humans have an obsession with control because we really have none? Do we strive to fill a void? A void in which we are cursed to never really control our own lives? A void in which when filled is a fake fofillment of control? Are we just marinette pupits in gods hands? Not alowed to make choice for ouself? cursed to an eternal game of chess? Being pushed acrossed the ""bord of life""? Regardless what what, or who we want to be? 
 This void, where and why is it here? Why do some feel it, but others dont feel the hopless void? Can some fill it with fake ideas? Ideas of ""control"" of people? Politics, or government bodys who belive they control the fate of ones nation? Or in christianity, and other realigions who teach of a higher power, who dosnt control us but gives us free will? If this free will is true, then why do some say..""I knwo your gunna be great somday."" Do we really want to be great? Or is it our destiny? Are we cursed to be what somone else wants? Or can we chose to be great, or not to be great. The luck, yes luck, of becoming great has high odds, stacked against us. In 200 years of being in existance only 42 people have ever had ""control"" of this country. Very few will really be remember. So what is to say that maybe, its decided ahead of time, in which case, what is the real point of living your life..will it just fall into place?"

But today i realizedt hat mychal is here to show me that maybe, i need to change some of my ways. More then just what has change, the drugs drinking, and smoking. Maybe I need to start going to church, and maybe just maybe I need to realize that god is there for me, not against me. I dont know how she mannages to get me think cuz she isnt the first to try, but the first to succeded. She is wonderfull, and if i never learn another thing from her, she has given me all I need to live, a chance to know what was wrong with me. THank you mychal, I love you! And I will love you for always!"

"event","So my aunt came down again...GREAT...I had just gottent o bed ( I worked over night (1201 am tell 8am) Been bitched at by a manger at a Food-4-less, which I will adress that store in a later entry, and had no sleep for like 26 hours. And here she come pissed off because, and I quote, Your trying to ruin my relationship with mom and dad, end quote. Yea right, she dosnt realize that basically I couldnt give a rats ass if she droped off the face of the planet. Why the hell would I care if she had a good relationship with mom and dad? OMG you dumb bitch find a new drama to live off of. I told my parents about when she got mad the last time, and that made her mad. Well I want her to understand, not that she is going to read this or anything, but at points i wish that i wasnt part of this family anymore. This family is such a crock of shit its not even funny. I hate it, I really do. If there isnt a problem make one. I came up with the family mato ""If we arnt fighting, we arnt trying."" Honestly at this point im at the point that i want to change my last name, run away and never talk to them again. Eh! I hate my family."

"event","My family has an issue...THey dont like me, I dont like them..so they can F OFF! My aunt came down today and decided that I do nothing..and the house was amess becasue ""You just sit on your butt and do nothing"" So here is what i did..I printed up a schudal thats shower in in 2 weeks i have 60 hours work in one of thoes weeks...so all I do is sit on my ass? Well if i look at it right...she is the one who only has tim to complain about what I do...so why dosnt she just shut up, and deal with the fact that she isnt going to find that im a lazy ass that does nothing..her is my sec for the next 3 days toinght i must be at work at 1201 am, and work tell prolly 8..then the next day be at work at 3am tell about 11is..now after all of this i have babysitting to do..so that I can make an extra buck or too to spend on my wonderfull gf, or on my wonderfull self. So explain where Im lazy?? I mean yea when i get home i want to clean as much as I want to go running naked though the street, with my dog tied to me..and a cat on my ass. The reason the house was a desaster was that Last night I lost somthing for work...Big deal right? Well if i didnt find it..i get fired..so what did i do? I RIPED THE HOUSE APART TO FIND IT..THEN GOT UP AT 8 TO CLEAN IT BUT NOOO LETS BE A <font size=""+6>BITCH</font> and not ask. So she said to me that mom and dad are going to be pissed when she calles..WEll bitch..beat you to it! I called first. LOL my family is one big drama! My other aunt thinks her shit dont stink..and trust me it does! IT stinky! But of corse my parents (I live with my grandparents) think she is the cream of the crop! And as for the boys..being my dad and uncle were just shit on there shoes..ITs sad...ppl who arent in my family notice it...DO YOU PEOPLE RELIZE WE ARE ONE FUCKED UP FAMILY?

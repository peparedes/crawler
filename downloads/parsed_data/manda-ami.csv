well not really, i have homework but its not that bad. i may start working again soon but not for a month or so. and all the other problems seem to deal with other peoples lives, so i guess i shouldn't worry too much.

i just want to relax and pass my classes. i think im doing a pretty good job so far.

id post pictures but its pointless since everyone has facebook.

I did RP testing today, came in late, and i thought it would be a lot of trouble beacuse i didn't sign up for and RP day in advance. But it was all good. I just told the atten. office i was RP testing and they gave me and excused note. so i still have 5 RP days left. cool.

I got into towson, so now i feeling a lot less stressed b/c i was nervous i woulnd't get in anywhere. i just have to see about penn state and MD right now. i can't wait to leave for college. 

My parents are going to visit my sister...and i REALLY want to go b/c i had so much fun last time and i miss her but i got grounded so they won't let me and im  jealous.

Being a senior is cool. I never get bothered about having a pass or not while being in the library or computer lab, and no one bothers my in the hallways either. 

i have nothing interesting to say but i felt like i should update. wow this entry is stupid,no need to comment."

"event","Today, I'm carrying my cat up the stairs with me and I fall, of course, becuase I always fall going up the stairs. Anyways, as i'm laying there, thinking of the bruise that will soon form, I hear what I think is my mom saying, ""are you okay?"" But no, she's actually saying ""Is the cat okay? Did you fall on her??"" She goes pyscho if she doesn't see her for two minutes and asks me if i know where she is. why would i know? i hate when people ask if i know where a random person is that i usually havn't talked to in ages. i've decided that i no longer like this new cat of mine. I've made an appropriate drawing to go along with this entry.

halloween is approaching...

which means i'm feeling sick because ive eaten too much candy corn already.

ryan brought a bag in yesterday, and after i ate a good amount of his, i went to CVS to buy some more and they were buy one get one free! so i mean of course i got two, and now i'm on my second bag. *nauseous*

ahhh SATs ARE SATURDAY!! anyone else somewhat nervous? i mean it's only the rest of my life. it's whatever, i'm chill(like my shirt).

sarah r told me about all of her stuff she bought at the craft store, and it got me into the making stuff mode. i havn't actually made anything yet, but i have thought about it twice.

rory zee sarah bryan on night one. david diana bryan nooooosh and jil on night 2. love those guys.
the only bad part was this morning. after everyone left my bro was like we could go out to breakfast if you want, just get the money mom gave us(she left like 40) and i could only find 15. he alreday told me how he was disappointed that i came home at 2 cuz he said he knew our parents were away but 2 is still a little too late and he thought i knew better than that. and then out of the 40 my mom gave the BOTH of us, 15 was left for us to split cuz i was all selfish and did w/e i wanted with the other 25. like just the look he had, and then yesterday he said we could hang out today or just finish HW if we need to, but this morning he was like im going to leave. it really sucked. cuz i mean my parents are always disappointed in me, and i always feel crappy around them, but then i usually call my bro or sis to get me through it and now he was the one upset with me. i really havn't felt that bad about myself in a while. 
i got the other 15 and all, and we're cool again. but man i suck."

my parents are not here so i've got the house to myself (and anyone else who wants to come over!) and i'm not feeling the constant pressure of thinking about school 24/7. :)
i made a new layout too. i felt it was time for a change. rory helped. i kinda i like it, but i'll prolly change it. 
i just found a bunch of CDs i thought i had lost and that's cool. i can't wait until i have time to get my license. only 2 weeks till the SATs. ha...i guess i think about school whether my mom is here or not.
some people are comming over and then we're going to someone's house, so that should be fun.

the awesome part of my day was going to the MD game with sarah who is awesome <3! we had realllllly bad seats so we sat in other people's and had to move like 15 times but it was all good. and plus we saw a family that was like the one from cheaper by the dozen. there was even a Fed-ex one! then we went and got food and visitied my parents who had awesome seats like 20 rows up, and there just happened to be 2 empty seats in front of them so we stayed there (it was much more fun with all of the MD students chanting and shaking their car keys).we won!

afterwards i went to old greenbelt to see garden state but of course it didn't work out so we walked around and then i left. i just don't even know anymore."

i've been working most of the summer, along with swimming, but every once and a while i do fun stuff.

on thursday...i think it was thursday...i went to pent. city with tommy and we got food and tried to go places, like into book stores but there were none, and into kb toys but it shut down. so we went to the air port and almost didn't get off at the right stop and yeah, we almost got lost like 10 times throughout the day.
rory came home friday! that was cool. i chilled with her for a couple hours and we saw a cinderella story, and i love hillary duff and of course chad MM so it was awesome..kinda.

then on sat, i did this dinner thingy at my pool, and then almost went to rory's, but then felt bad cuz i thought should be at the swim-a-thon raising money. so i went there and it ended up getting rained out and everyone left at 3 in the morning so that sucked.

i almost went to georgetown with Will and one of his friends but then i couldn't leave when he was and i didn't want to ride the metro alone so i went shopping with my sister and bought stuff since i actually have money now. so that was cool.

now im back at work. no fun. and all my friends are gone. poop."

yesterday was a lot of fun. after swim i went to cheverly pool all day and chilled with tommy, charles and danny. it was fun even though i got dunked like a kajillion times. then we went back to tommy's for like an hour and listened to music, played video games and watched some cartoon that was funny. then came Spiderman 2 with tommy and bryan. good movie..er..at least the action scenes and him flying through the city. the love part/the end was kinda stupid.  then we we got food and went to my house for a little. good good day.
so far, today has also been fun. had a swim meet, which i did really well in and after getting food (and running into nate! its so nice to see people you thought you might not see for a year or so) i hung out at the pool with all my favorite pool people. i think im going bowling later. i hope they have the flashy lights and stuff. fun. bye."

"event","today is so....i dont know...blah. my sister is comming home from college...so that's good, but i've felt blank all day. i feel like everyone is depressed, or mad at me, and then i feel crappy. i can't tell if im upset or not. like i'll be in a really good mood, but then start to think about my situation with friends, and then get depressed. ive been thinking a lot today. i dont really know what to do, cuz sometimes you do something and everything is ruined. i dont even know what im saying"

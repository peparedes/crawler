Saw things that I didnt expect.  Thats right.  I saw things.
I'm going for a cup of tea, to get my thoughts together on the night, and to have a look at the many, many photos."

If you occasionally seem<br>to display more vulnerability than your<br>predecessors, it's probably because you're more<br>openly human than they were.

"event","Cant sleep so just been 'surfing' the search engines, putting in words, phrases etc.
I ended up putting details of an ex girlfriend.

Sadly she had to go and identify her dead father, who had been missing some time.

Turns out he had died on the same Hebridian island that I - this weekend - had been planning to arrange my Honeymoon on.

Weird, or what?"

"event","Just two - Love Actually .....

Love Actually is the ultimate feel good movie and it excels with that.  The way that all the characters link together is superb, with a chain leading down from the Prime Minister (Hugh Grants best role IMO) right down to the sandwich seller Colin.  It doesnt ask for a lot but just leaves a nice warm feeling.

And 28 Days Later.....

What a totally different film with some smashing imagery, really good acting and just the whole idea is mind blowing.  The scenes set in a deserted London are just superb.  At the end of it all though, its a Zombie movie but its carried off with such style you cant ask for more.

What about the shit of the year though?

I really couldnt sit through Chicago or even Moulin Rouge, I dont believe musicals work particularly well on film - you lose the edge of actually being there that you have in a theatre as i think the participation angle is so important - Isnt Rocky Horror far better in a theatre then that turgid mess of a movie which peters out after the first 15 admittedly excellent minutes?"

Today was my last 'treatment' for now and 2 fillings and now totally descaled teeth I think I can finally feel more confident about speaking to people and that sort of thing.  You know my teeth were that bad that in my bottom set, I didnt realise that there were GAPS between them!
Now starts the business of keeping the buggers clean.

On another note, why does Katy get herself pregnant at a time when all T and I can do at the moment is talk about baby names?  Thanks Katy, you're a bloody great help! :-)"

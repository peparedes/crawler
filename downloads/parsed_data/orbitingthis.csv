"event","I met my neighbor looking for apartments. I had to move. My boyfriend lived an hour away, nobody lived where I lived. So I started apartment hunting. 

I find some overpriced hippie commune of a complex somewhere I think will make me feel different about myself somehow, so I can justify moving with the substantive qualifier of ""a new phase of life."" Lana (pronounced ""Lane-uh"" to confuse and annoy everyone) is driving my boyfriend and I around in a really shitty tiny Ford I can't remember the name of. Her insecurity bled all over us before we even got in her car to view the new apartment. ""Sorry,"" says Lane-uh, ""It's a rental. It's really awful."" Nervous laugh.

The first two apartments she showed me made me want to off myself in the most dramatic way possible. Shitty. Expensive. And SHITTY. I can see her seeing my lack of interest, and quickly she says, ""There's a space coming up in my building. It's a little out of your price range, but I think you would LOVE.IT."" (Turned out to only be $50/month more. She and I live different lifestyles. Is that shitty to say? Moving on.)

She rambles on about the wine nights she shares with other cute single girls in the building (""everyone's so friendly!""), how accepting of her children everyone was (""




Lost interest.
Point of story- I move in. This girl is the most unfriendly bitch I've ever met. What?"

I forced them (because I'm 24 years old and living with my parents... [yeah, who has the bigger problem here]) to clean it all out. I spent today going through the bulk of bullshit in the garage and came across a stack of canvas. I started sifting through it and asked my mom what it was. She moaned uninterested.

"event","Here's what's stupid.

We all spend our entire lives trying to mask the intensity of our emotions. I'm not even only talking about people who you're in love with. Or even people who you REALLY like. I just feel like we all spend so much time with the ""what does this text mean"" ""he didn't call today, maybe he'll call tomorrow"" ""when do I call"" bullshit bullshit. It's just constant. And sometimes I just really wish that we could all rip down those walls and just be honest. Even when it's a situation that's meaningless. It doesn't have to be huge or important. But sometimes I feel like I'm just so hungry for honesty - even if it's hurtful, just so I don't have to hack through the bullshit bushes of cover-ups and insecurity and this and that. 

Sometimes I think about just calling up a guy I hardly know but have some level of feelings for (for no reason)- just calling and saying, ""Hi. It's me. This is what I feel (insert feelings). And you can laugh at me, you can think I'm crazy. Because right now I'm immune to that. I'm incapable of bullshit. And this is ME being REAL. This is really what life should be. So you can laugh, but later when you're alone and you're feeling lonely I know you're going to think of all this shit I'm saying and you're going to agree. Whether you ever vocalize it or not."" 

Because we're all just the exact same. We're all searching and fighting for another person who can make us feel validated and purposeful and beautiful- not in the gay way, but the real way. And any new person who's attractive to us, who pays attention to us, always carries that hope of being THAT person who can make us feel all those things. Even when all the evidence points to the opposite - this person is BAD for you, makes you feel shitty, doesn't care about you, blah blah rah rah - even then, we'll grab onto that hope for dear life. Because that's what makes us human. Just that constant search and fight. 

I'm bored with the cover-ups. I'm trying to do the RIGHT thing and dispose of all the trash and the losers and the guys who are around for reasons that make no sense, and aren't responsive enough, or interesting enough, or interested in me enough- but I just don't have the answers. And sometimes I think if I just called, if I just was totally honest, to the point of insanity, if I just shut up and swallowed my fear and DID it that I'd find my own answer. 

But I will wash my makeup off and go to bed instead. And that's stupid."

"event","I have found journaling is critical to understanding the evolution of yourself. There are times of life, we all do it, where we become so blinded by the current- the here and now- that we become incapable of understanding our past, of how things once were, of how they could be different. Where we have forgotten what light looks like.

At times I will think back to when I was in love with everyone, or liked a job, felt accomplished, worth something. I'll track it back to the general time period in my journal and read. Instantly I'm transplanted into this other person's life, her way of thinking, her different view of the world. And where I was previously so certain that ""now"" and ""back then"" were one in the same, that I spoke the same, thought the same, felt the same about everything- I remember through these words that this person is not me today. That the future me could be anyone. If you wrote things down, you would understand this too.

And all of this to remind you that the world is everything, but most importantly it is changeable- and changing. That the comfort you've found, the days you've sunk down into, the life you've chosen that you wear like old clothes, this well-formed understanding and belief, this foundation you've constructed for yourself...that all of it clings to you with a false loyalty, like a lie. That any moment it will leave you for someone else. To become someone else's foundation. Someone else's old clothes.  It can evaporate, slowly- or disappear all at once like a nightmare. And you will be left with nothing you know but a body, heart, and mind. Unconnected to anything, unfettered and alone. Every part of it is terrifying. And you will grasp for any known thing, but all of it -in it's entirety- has left you.

All of this happening to remind you that in any circumstance life can open its doors to you, reminding you why it is beautiful."

"event","Everyone always tells you that college is the time where you discover yourself. I think that's bullshit. College is almost exactly like high school but with alcohol and no parents. Sure, you're on your own for the first time and you have more freedom, but the structure and the expectations aren't really any different. Go to class, get good grades, graduate. All that is the same.

The hard part is when the institution spits you out into the world and tells you to make something of yourself. Then all of the dreams and expectations you once had leave you confused and unfulfilled. Then nothing makes sense anymore. Everything is repetitive. And you ache for that structure you once had. That period of life where you think ""I haven't started my life yet"" so it's okay if it isn't perfect. But then you get that job, and that job defines you. You wear it like a label. And if you hate that label, you hate yourself. And soon all the labels look and sound the same. Nothing has any appeal. Everything is the same mechanical, boring loop as everything else. 

Just replace all the ""you's"" with ""I"" I guess is what I'm trying to say."

Oh my God I'm answering one of the livejournal ""writer's block"" questions. Who have I become. 

To answer the question, I can honestly say probably nothing. I don't think that answer is as bad as what I'm about to say in reference to that which is: I honestly don't care. I'd rather go home and play Sims and fall into a mind-numbing, wine-induced stupor before I waddle my way into bed at 10:30pm only to wake up the next morning to rinse and repeat. 

I'm going to start journaling more (journaling came up as mispelled... how is that not a word? And mispelled is mispelled? Am I mispelling mispelled?!)Writing has always been therapeutic for me and I find I only turn to it on days that are particularly hard. I think maybe a more daily update will help me to reflect back on day-to-day moods in order to organize my thoughts and look at myself in the bigger picture.

I can't believe I've had this journal for something like 7yrs now. I was looking at my profile the other day (basically trying to make sure anything that could possibly link this journal to me through a Google search was deleted) and I saw that I had something like 1300 postings. That's insane. It inspired me to keep them coming.

I went to the library yesterday to check out Men are From Mars and Women are From Venus. Please, stifle the laughter. It's a book that my mom has been shoving down my throat for a long time. I've always responded with a scoff full of skepticism anytime she mentioned it before. I told her about my sex life yesterday (something I had obviously been dreading for at least 400 days) and it was relieving. Sometimes just being able to vocalize your problem to a person you never thought you could is a lifted weight. Anyway, she kept going back to me reading this book. So, yes. I'm reading it. Or trying to anyway. 

Do you ever have moments where you hate yourself? Not in a suicidal, super-dark, self-loathing kind of way, but in a ""who have I become"" kind of way? That's what I felt last night as I was standing over the stove making dinner with a glass of wine and felt my eyes well with tears while on page two of the introduction of that damn book. To be fair to myself, I think I was just upset with the fact that my life has come to self-help books at 23 years old. I was kind of hoping that stage could be post marriage/kids/mini-van.

I need someone to give me some answers about my future. I feel like our generation is a mess. Our parents grew up where you started a job and then you finished it 50 years later. Our generation can't get a job, then can't hold it. Everyone changes industries 20 times. Nobody works in a job that they majored in. Nobody has any consistency or commitment to anything. We're all just gluttons. In every sense of the word."

"event","I had a heart to heart with my gynecologist last Friday. We talked about my lack of sex-drive. How I'm a 60 year old woman trapped in a 23 year old's body. When I say heart-to-heart I really mean it was an emotionally constricted conversation I was dreading for 2 days prior to the appointment that consisted of maybe 10 sentences exchanged while I tried to hide the baseball size ""need to cry"" lump in my throat. I don't even know why it's so hard to talk about this subject to the point that I feel like a complete child. Like a weak stupid little child. 

She gave me the names of an endocronologist, sex therapist, and life coach. She also told me to spend my weekend making a vision board. I don't know what that says about a person's life when their gynecologist is suggesting they make a vision board. 

I have to say the conversation with her woke me up inside and made me feel the most inspired I have in a long time. Maybe inspired is not the right word, but I felt a hopeful. She said to me, ""It sounds like a lot of things are going to open up for you in a couple of months,"" mainly in reference to my job. The way she said it made me feel alive again. This feeling lasted for maybe another couple hours, then I think I just felt sad about our talk. I never made the vision board.

I think sometimes I feel so jealous of people who just have passion for something. You don't have to be great at what you do, but just to know that there's something out there that you want, and that you're willing to fight for it... I think that's maybe a better gift than the talent itself. It's a terrible way to live- so listless and uncommitted to anything. No bigger picture and no greater goal. 

I might be overwhelmed by the idea of trying to find what it is that I want, than actually going after it once I find it."

"event","I never see famous people. Last night we went out to dinner with a friend of Kris' who grew up in no-town USA and now has this uncontainable ego because he's Mr. Something. We had dinner with the friend and Tommy Hilfiger's brother because he works with him doing some kind of job that after numerous explanations I still had no idea what the hell his job actually was. I'm pretty sure that's exactly the effect he was going for. After my $715 hamburger we moseyed into the cramped little hotel bar. I was falling asleep in my vodka tonic making the ""can we go soon"" eyes at Kris, when in walks Kings of Leon. David Spade. ZZ Top. John Mayer. Kid Rock. 

I got that little rush in my stomach that makes you feel like you're supposed to do something different with yourself. That this is your BIG chance. Pull out your cell phone, text everyone you know. Fix your hair. Don't stare. That feeling that pushes you to want to say something nobody has ever said to John Mayer before, or crack an amazing joke in front of David Spade. Or flip your hair and look sexy across the room for I-don't-know-you-but-I-heard-you're-in-the-band man. 

It was a strange environment, because it wasn't a big ""to-do"" function. We weren't on the street surrounded by paparazzi. And the bar was microscopic too. I think I brushed elbows with each of them at least once. Even here they weren't safe. People would come up to them and introduce themselves. They'd try to seem different. They'd try to get noticed. They'd try to act cooler than they were. It makes your skin crawl just watching, and it makes you feel exhausted for people who have this EVERYWHERE they go. I think about all the people I talk to at my job who want to come on the show and they all think they're different. There is nothing new they can say to me. I cannot be surprised by anything. What an awful feeling for that to be your life all the time. 

And GOD, you should have seen all the girls who were just total LA blowhards. I went to the bathroom and there were a group of them. They're all blonde (and if they aren't blonde, they're brunette and have cliche tattoos) and they all dress the same. I thought to myself in the stall listening to them talk that all the movies I had seen in my life when I thought, ""This girl is a terrible actress"" that maybe I was wrong. People like this really exist. You know they go home to their cheap Ikea/Target/Pier-1 filled apartments and pretend to be important so they can at least say they've had sex with someone who is.

Even my friend Jon was getting approached by girls like this and he admitted they were only doing it to see if he was ""somebody."" I told him to tell the girls he was a writer for The Office. He didn't comply. 

I'm bored here. I'm ready for something else."

"event","I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I am someone who will never be satisfied. I guess I have always associated the idea of personal, deep-down satisfaction with adulthood. That at a certain age you no longer question what you want from yourself and others. I mean, I understand to some degree that happens, but those little basic humanity questions are not what I'm talking about. You don't see grandparents going through phases where they wear stupid clothes and talk like someone else. Or maybe you do? I can't organize my thoughts right now.

The point I'm trying to make is, and I'm not saying I'm an unhappy person, but sometimes I feel more alive sitting on the couch in my toothpaste stained pajama shirt watching some corny movie than I do when I'm actively participating in ANYTHING in my life. Is this normal? I'm just not living right. It wasn't always this way, and it's not some horrible sad thing- but it becomes that way.

Why is it sometimes so hard to say 'I love you' to someone you love and have for a long time?

I felt like updating, but my thoughts are like popcorn bouncing around in my head right now and nothing feels settled. That's all I guess. 

I think I'll go read someone else's journal."

i went to the lacma (art museum) a few weeks ago when kris was in pennsylvania. i went by myself. i hadn't done anything like that in a long time. they had one room that had a giant replica of a wooden dining room table, so that when you walked in you were walking underneath the table and it was supposed to give you the feeling of being a little kid again. i really liked that room and i wanted to stay in there a long time. the whole experience of being there alone in that environment made me feel really safe. i want to go back there today, and not be stuck in this cubicle of frustration. 

i also got to see magritte's famous pipe painting there. i was really excited to see it, because i think magritte's my favorite artist. it's weird to stand in front of the original of something you've known and seen copies of your entire life. i think someday i'd like someone to stand in front of me and look at me like that."

"event","i think i hate my job. i think i hated it before i ever started it, and i've been too afraid to leave it because i don't have options. i know i'm going to quit at the end of this season. then i'm going on a trip to africa with my family, which will more than likely severely hinder me from getting a job right after this one. i'll freak out, and probably have a breakdown. if it gets bad enough i might move home, and have another, probably bigger breakdown.

i think it's probably time for my quarter life crisis. i'm so over this stress-about-nothing bullshit. i'm so tired of skipping out on funerals and weddings because i'm working 7 days a week for nothing. i'm tired of being talked to like i'm a fucking idiot. i'm tired of saving money to take exciting vacations and never having the time to actually do it. i'm tired of being afraid to leave for 10 minutes to go grab lunch. i want a normal 9-5, golden retriever life. 

i don't even know if i really meant that. i want something different though. i want to make a difference. and i want what i do to matter to someone."

"event","i want to go back to my high school senior year english class where i'm required to read good books and talk/write about them. i miss that. 

when i was watching the oscars tonight i got pretty inspired. even though i think this year's oscars were pretty bad. the jokes/writing was pretty putrid. but i just got to thinking how in the WORLD does anyone ever make it far enough to win an oscar. it blows my mind. it's weird just moving out to LA b/c i feel like i'm already so much closer to the industry, b/c i physically AM and also b/c people are always talking about hollywood life. and yet, i feel like now b/c i'm closer i'm FURTHER from it in some uninspiring blahblah way. i like how i couldn't think of an adjective there. or adverb. whatever that is.

sometimes i miss myself. i would say i spend maybe 5hrs/month alone. i'm always working around a million people, with my boyfriend, or with my roommate. i miss being alone. it's important to be lonely sometimes. it desensitizes you to being overly sensitized which makes everything feel bland after awhile.

i can't focus b/c i never write in this thing anymore. it's strange. i think the main reason why i stopped writing in here is b/c i started spending so much of my time around other people. but whenever i find myself alone (like now) all of a sudden i want to come back to the good ole LJ. i think it's a good thing. 

for some reason it feels better to know that no matter what you're writing about, how trivial it may be, that maybe someone else will read it. that's comforting."

"event","people always ask people what their favorite drink is. for a long time i never had an answer because i was always mixing it up. i'm like that. i've never used the same shampoo. i get excited when i'm on my last squirt so i can go buy something new. i like small changes like that. anyway, about a year ago i started ordering vodka tonics and gin & tonics the most. not because i liked the taste, because i didn't really at first. it was bitter and the mixer didn't really seem to mask the alcohol flavor. but i liked the way ordering that drink sounded. and i liked the idea i associated with the kind of people i thought ordered those kind of drinks. now that's all i drink. and it's legitimately my favorite. anything else is too sugary, or the alcohol is too heavy with flavor- like whisky or rum.

i'm rambling. but my point is, sometimes i feel like my whole life is like the vodka tonic thing. like i just pick things because i like the way they sound- and the preconceived, unrealistic notions i associate with them. i don't think it's a bad thing. but sometimes it does seem like every decision we ever make is petty and arbitrary. no matter what the reason. 

i want to watch a romantic comedy."

"event","Washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook out again. I write from the bed as I did last year. Will see the doctor Monday. ""Yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-aches and my back hurts."" ""Are you drinking?"" he will ask. ""Are you getting your exercise, your vitamins?"" 

I think that I am just ill with life. The same stale yet fluctuating factors. Even at the track I watch the horses run by and it seems meaningless. I leave early after buying tickets on the remaining races. ""Taking off?"" asks the motel clerk. ""Yes, it's boring,"" I tell him. ""If you think it's boring out there,"" he tells me, ""You oughta be back here.""

So here I am propped up against my pillows again just an old guy just an old writer with a yellow notebook.

Something is walking across the floor toward me.
oh, it's just 
my cat
this
time."

"event","I have to research child molestation/molesters all day long because of our next show at work. It's bothering me so much. 

I looked up all the registered sex offenders around my apartment, and because I live in an on-the-verge-of-being-a-lot-nicer-than-it-currently-is part of town there were like 20 registered offenders within walking distance of my house. Including one who's apartment window I'm pretty sure I can see from mine.

Also, the closest store to my apartment is ""Le Sex Shoppe"" who's back door opens up right in front of our balcony, so whenever people get kicked out we can always hear/see the fight which ensues. There are some scary fucking people getting kicked out of porn stores. I'm also pretty sure I've witnessed one guy pick up a mentally handicapped homeless man so they could fuck in his Honda behind the porn store.

I'm scared of everyone in my neighborhood. I don't trust anybody.

We got a note on our door last night about a party our new neighbors were having. Even though it was a ""Halo 3"" party I was almost too scared to go meet them because I had convinced myself they were psycho mass murderer child molestors. My whole outlook on life is warped because of my job. I spend entirely too much time here immersed in really negative shit.

"event","There was an accident on my way to work this morning. The traffic on the freeway was horrible and eventually narrowed down to one lane. When I got to the front of the line the officer asked me to stop and wait. 

I could see the white SUV flipped over and compressed from its own weight. The dead body was about fifteen feet from my car. The man's jeans and work boots were sticking out from underneath the bloodstained sheet that had formed perfectly to the shape of his body. I could see the streaks of blood where his body had scraped and rolled across the pavement after being thrown from his car. His CDs were scattered around his body like lights. 

After about five minutes the officer waved me on and for the next two miles before I made my exit for work I was the only car on that otherwise bumper-to-bumper LA freeway. 

I kept thinking about who's job it was to wash the blood off the pavement and whether there would be a stain where the man's body used to be. A stain I would have to drive over every morning on my way to work."

"event","I decided to reread old entries from past years instead of work right now. So I went back to today five years ago and it was the day my stepmom found out my dad was having an affair and she and I got into a big fight about how I was the cause of it. And as I was reading it I was remember some of the way that had felt, but what was stranger is that I couldn't really remember all of the feelings. And it doesn't seem like it was five years ago, but I guess that was the main way I could tell a lot of time had passed. That I couldn't even totally relate to my own journal entry anymore. 

I miss my family a lot, and I've been thinking a lot about moving home. I don't think I want to stay in California much past this year."

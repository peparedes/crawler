"event","so there's only 2 slash 4 days of 10th grade left, and then i'm off to juniordom.  i'm a little nervous, but really excited.  i'm the new assistant drum major, and i have alot of new responsibilities i'm gonna have to get used to.  our first car wash is the 29th, so my duties have begun.  even the few things i've done so far have put a different perspective on the entire drum major persona.  i've taken on a big position, and my devotion to this band is the thing that's going to make it all worth my while.  for everyone that's part of our loving band family, i want you to know that i'll be there for any of you if you need help with marching, music, or just wanna talk.  i'm going to do my best to make this year amazing, and have fun while we're at it.  people who aren't in something like band will probably think this sounds really lame, but it's something thats important to some of us.  oh and another thing, this year, we're gonna paaaaaaartaaaaaaaaay when it comes time.  when it's time to have fun, there's going to be plenty of it because....you all know how much i like to have fun.  so here's to a new year *CHEERS*.  on saturday, i went up to vegas with amber and H to get some instruments fixed (including my own).  it was a lot of fun...we had lunch at in-and-out and then we saw most of van helsing.  we had to leave a little early to get amber back for a church thing.  my sax plays super nice again, so all is well.  and how about that dustin boy.  i still love every minute that i get to spend with him.  he's such an amazing person, i can't even imagine what life would be like without him being there, making life seem so much more worth while.  mushy mushy haha, well only 18 days until we fly to minnesota.  i'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO excited!!!! AAAAHHHH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh.  oh well, i must be off. *smooches*"

"event","so today was an odd day indeed.  i was sposed to hang out with rhiannan but she never called *shakey fist*.  i talked to clare online and one thing lead to another and she picked me up and we got starbucks.  after that we came back here and watched how to deal (good as ever) and then she took off.  i sang and danced with my new plant a bit.  it's a ""bleeding heart"" hahaha, no emo kids room is complete without one!  i got this grand idea bout how i wanna chop all my hair off and dye it brown like mandy moores in how to deal, so having the nonexistant life that is mine, i superimposed my face on mady moores body for about 8 hours total.  the result can be seen below...

i'm such a freeeeeeeeeeeeeeak.  i also had a crazy wild mood swing tonight.  i didn't get to hang out with rhiannan, i discovered disguuuuuuusting creepy crawly wormies in my new plant so i ahd to take it out of my room, and i can't paint my room this week.  i did get my naked time shrit in though, but no one got to see it :(.  i started talkin to nick hanson again too.  bad shiz.  this time around i'm not gonna let anyone push me into stuff i don't wanna do.  it sounded better in my head during my mood swing.  it was more like...

i just took 2 emo pictures of myself.  i really do wish i could find the set date when a large chunk of teenagers became emo and depressed.  i wish i didn't sound trendy when i'm truly sad now. kids screw everything up.  everything is flying through my head right now, so this is just gonna flow thoughtwise.  i think about how nothing ever seems to go right, how nothing ever really makes me happy, yet i always seem it even to myself. why mood swings like this make me beleive stupid comments like the one that just came out of my own mouth.  why do i have to be an extremist in everything.  i was watching dr phil today and he was talking to a lady who either has addictive eating or addictive anorexia at any given time, and that sounds about like me.  i've kept it at bay pretty damn well though, maybe thats just how everyone is.  that's another thing, i'm so completely in love with dustin, but he's far to beautiful of a person to be stuck with me.  i know thats not true, but there's always the feeling of simpathy to him and the nagging fear of the day he realizes it too.  one minute i think i'm perfectly cute and smart and fun and all that good stuff, and then i think of other girls he could be with and say ""they're no good at all...what do they have that i don't"" and i rethink it...""they're skinny, and have pretty hair, and are much 'cooler'"".  but on the same token i know as much about music and stuff as anybody, and i'm always myself.  it's sooooo back and forth.  after about 12 hours i'll look back at this and not agree with any of it and it will be in the past, words not to be taken seriously.  i've never been so committed to a person in my life, and i am to dustin.  i can't see myself ever not being with him, and that idea doesn't scare me like it did even 6 months ago.  maybe i need a new me.  everytime i see scissors i snip more off my hair. it's insane i tell you.  maybe it's the birth control pills.  maybe it's the sex.  maybe it's me going a little be crazy.  tomorrow rhi and i are takign pictures in the park.  i have 2 rolls i'm willing to spare, and maybe they'll give me an idea of who i am.  or not.  i always want someone to talk to about all this shit, but no one cares, or they care to much.  i talk to alysha about the eating business.  she's the only person i've talked to that's like me about it.  where it becomes this sick game against your body to see how few calories a day you can eat, and how much you can excercise without passing out.  it's ridiculous, but it's not easy to stop.  i'm lucky i stopped when i did.  at disneyland i morphed into this person who didn't want any human contact whatsoever.  it was weird stuff.  i think i'm much moodier with the hormones and stuff. little things will get to me, and i'm more EMOtional than before.  i watched tapes from when i was 11 and 12 today, and i was the fattest kid around.  i wasn't fat really i guess, just really round.  and had huge round glasses.  i wish someone would have told me i wasn't going to look like that forever.  in fact, the next year i got contacts and thinned out and my hair finally grew out and i was actually cute.  random thoughts eveeeeeeeerrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyywhere.  i'm talking to nick right now about all the shit daniel caused everytime he didn't get his way, and then he'd play it off like i started it.  i hate daniel for changing the way i used to stick up for myself, and how he didn't treat me right and i was always blind to the fact.  dustin's shown me how i should be treated now, so that's better.  no more living in the past, only striving to life in the present.  i have people that care about me, and people that are my number one priority.  i hope they all know it.  i wish everyone would just get along.  i wish the idiots would just leave people alone, and leave us all drama-free.  but whos to say whats right.  right and wrong are only stick on labels in the great scheme of things.  i have no point.  someday i will.  this is so incoherent it's not even funny. i'm leaving now."

"event","i had this uncontrollable urge to watch a disney movie this morning, and i got my grubby little paws on beauty and the beast!!!  oh so much fun.  the previews were frickin weird though, because it said ""this 92' season disney is releasing their 41st animated movie Aladdin!!!""  that was TWELVE YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!  how weird is that?  twelve years ago aladdin hadn't even come out!  craziness i tell you.  the years are flying by.  in two years i'll be off to college.  where at? no idea. to become what? no clue. oh lord.  i'm afraid.  maybe nau...that'd be cool.  or else minnesota...that'd be soooo much fun.  i can't decide if i wanna go where i know people (nau) or where i'm in love with the town, and can start rather fresh (duluth) or if i wanna go somewhere completely new where everything can be different.  so many choices.  only time will tell.  i'm diggin this live journal thing though, so i'll be stayin here. i'm such a journal whore.  i have opendiary, xanga, and now live journal too.  the day that i update each of them is the day my life loses all meaning though.  i'm a loser.

"event","so it appears that this is my first entry!  all the cool kids are here and stuff, aka, alysha, so i decided i'd be cool too.  todays the first day of spring break and i still haven't showered.  off to a good start i'd say.  this last week we went to disney land (we being the band) and it was mucho fun.  i smell a top ten list coming on.

10) tory in her belle costume, and tory being forced to change out of the belle costume by the disney land militia for fear of her being mistaken as the ""real"" belle. hahahahaha she had pirate socks, an eye patch, a sword, and a parrot on! 

9) when people pull your legs up to your butt and then hold them there with the extreme wedgie they gave you.  yes, underwear around the feet.  pain.

8) seui freaking out on california screamin and h laughing at seui so hard that he was crying

7) crying on the ferris wheel of doom

6)the cool mime story i wasn't involved with.  they were abducted by a mime and forced to sing zippidi-doo-da and then they were given beads.  rad beyond belief.

5) being all alone in disney land and taking pictures of sparkly trees.  

4) being rejected by minnie.  that bitch.  she broke a young girl's heart. 

3) when the uk decided to send their elite force of miscreants to get timon's signature when i was approxamitly 1.5 inches away from him.  let it be known that i stood there for at least 15 minutes before i finally got tough and cut their little asses off.  i'm to kind.

2) bill being so damn excited about the roller coaster hahahahaha

1)  the conversations the occured on the way home.  including rhinos flying out my vagina, me being jesus, the updated version of the bible, kyle and bill teaching me how to talk shit, bill inventing penis flowers, me choreographing a broadway show for the penis flowers, kyle abusing me with the seat back, and much, much more."

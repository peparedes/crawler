"event","OK so this is a thing that people have been doing I guess. I don't have an mp3 player at the moment, unless you count my phone (which would just result in a lot of Wedding Present and a song whose words are ""Dup Dwee Do Dap Do Dwee Dah"", or something pretty similar (bonus point for picking that - shouldn't be too hard)), so I'm gonna chuck up a playlist in foobar of everything on my computer, put up the words to the first line of the first 20 things to come up on random, and you have to tell me who and what they are.

1: OK right off the bat we have the theme from <i>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</i>. This has vocals I guess, but I most of them are sort of grunts or prolonged ""Ahhh""s. I guess you could guess ""Ah-e-a-e-a... wah weh woh"", but I'll be fair.
1, part 2: Strawberry fields banana trees. Banana fields strawberry trees.
2: Under houses. Under houses. Under houses.
3: Sitting up late. The ash in the grate. (according to the site I looked this up on 'cause I couldn't hear it clearly enough. Sounds more like ash on the ground to me).
4: The frickin' Conet Project. I have no idea what the Czech lady is saying. Or that she's Czech, I'm just getting that from the filename.
4, part 2: You're not punk, and I'm telling everyone.
5: Put that gun to my temple. Put that gun to my heart. (for the sake of clarity, I'm listening to the version of this song with the shorter title. Much clearer).
6: <s>Who took the bomp? Every day and night</s>. Le Tigre - Deceptacon <lj user=""cadaverique"">
7: <s>Eighteen thousand lira. Eighteen thousand lira. </s>18 000 Lira - Art Brut <lj user=""cadaverique"">
8: I looked into the light, I couldn't find a single place I knew but then it's been that kind of year.
9: All my life I have wondered why life's tragedies seem to pass me by.
10: Lately you seem like another language.
11: Go! Been so long. Forgot what it's like.
12: <s>I'm leavin' here, gettin' out of this place.</s> British Sea Power - How Will I Ever Find My Way Home? <lj user=""frankenchokey"">
13: I called you up the other day to see if you would come to play.
14: A sound clip from the Simpsons. Must've had that one for a while.
14, part 2: An instrumental.
14, part 3: I'll tell you this. I'll tell you for sure. We have a future.
15: Rains for days so you stay inside and lock your door.
16: One more coffee one more cigarette. One more morning trying to forget.
17: This was Halogen's ""Caught Me"", but I can't figure out what the first line is.
17, part 2: Skies falling down. I feel ashamed.
18: <s>My name is Jonas. I'm carrying the whale.</s> Weezer - My Name is Jonas <lj user=""frankenchokey"">
19: Another instrumental.
19, part 2: <s>The reception's gotten fuzzy. The delicate balance has shifted.</s> The Mountain Goats - Dilaudid <lj user=""cadaverique"">
20: I'm pretty sure this isn't in english, even though I found english lyrics for it on google. Anyway, it's My Little Airport with ""Song of Depression"".
20, part 2: <s>Turn around. Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you never come around.</s> (this version is a cover, and I don't think it spoils the game too much to tell you that I'm listening to Boyracer, because A: they've covered everything, and B: It's pretty easy anyway). Total Eclipse Of The Heart <lj user=""cadaverique"">

Man, ridiculous. There's actually three of those that're by the same act (one was instrumental though), and two by another act. Which makes me wonder a bit about foobar's random function. Also there's a song in there that's by a band formed by a former member of a band with another song in there. Though it seems unlikely foobar would make that connection."

"event","So I've been listening to Paris 1919 by John Cale a bit lately. It's on the CD in my car, and it's too hard to change disc while driving, so I hear it about once every 80 minutes that I'm in my car. Which is depressingly often.

Anyway, I've been thinking about what it's about. I'm going to attempt to write about it from memory, since as you can see I'm listening to a one minute and forty-one second song about David Gedge for the period of time it takes to write this, including when I walk downstairs to get either a beer or a coke in a minute (and when I check my diary to make sure I don't have work in the morning). I got beer and coke. Aw yeah, livin' the life. I certianly will not be checking a written copy of the lyrics.

I figure it's about some historical event, but maybe that's because I've been listening to a bit of the Lucksmiths' <i>The Green Bicycle Case</i> album lately, which has a historical title and at least two historical songs in it (speaking of which, I got a copy of <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> today). My initial thoughts had to do with the justice system, on the basis of the line ""I am the judge and I've come to claim you with my iron drum"". I obviously don't know much about the French justice system. My current line of thought has to do with Ghosts. ""I am the Church and I've come to claim you with my iron drum"" seems sort of sensible. Plus I'm pretty sure the word ""Ghost"" appears in the song.

Is the line ""On Mondays she'd be there, but on Tuesdays not at all, just casually appearing from the cock across the hall""? I'd say probably not, but even if we assume that when John says ""Cock"" he means ""Clock"", that's not right. Although ""Cock"" raises the interesting and upsetting possibility that the song is about ejaculate, in which case the Church is probably coming for some kind of decency related behaviour. A ghost appearing from, or through, a clock seems to make more sense.

Alright, time to look up the words. Actually first I'll listen to the song again, but don't tell the music thing that. The only other thing I can remember without reference is pleasant sounding French place names in JC's voice. Oh yes: Grief. Fridays she'd be there, Mondays not at all. Hear a ghost. La. It all comes back. ""William William William"" seems like kind of poor lyric writing. ""I am the mission""?

Maybe it's a metaphor? Time to actually look it up this time. Apparently I'm almost all wrong. Wednesdays not at all. Bloody hell."

"event","So my pal Jhonny and I were on our way to the big day out back at the start of the month, and as we're on the train in the station a Channel 9 cameraman comes over. We figure it's some thing about crowds of young people thronging to Claremont or whatever. Anyway, the guy's to Jhonny like ""Just talk on your phone a bit, mate"", which he does. The guy films.

That evening, Channel 9 screens a report on people talking on the phone on the train, or something. I haven't seen it, being as I was at the BDO (and also because Channel 9 is locked in desperate battle with 7 for the title of worst TV station in the country and I don't usually watch their news anyway). But the word is, Jhonny was on the TV, and Channel 9 was lying about his being an example of poor train etiquette. Posed news! So weak."

"event","So it's been a big week for me. My band broke up last sunday. Apparently I was on get shows and organise recording while everyone else is out of town duty. The shows fell through and I didn't get around to the recording research. Not that it likely mattered much, since we can never manage to get everybody in one place at once unless we're at a BBQ or something, which is inappropriate time for band practice/recording. There's more to it than that, I guess. Wasn't my decision, so how would I know.

I guess it's kind of a relief, in a way. Hope nobody was hangin' out for Fireflies shows, 'cause it's too late now. Ben and I have another thing on with Kenta, hopefully to start shows before too long. I think we have one on Feb 8th at the Hydey. Jazz might take this chance to join El Cid, I don't know (guys I'm pretty much joking here, unless that actually is your plan. Like I say, I don't know).

The other thing is I bought a car. It's pretty sweet. 2005 Camry, 'bout 26K on the odometer. Not really used to driving a sedan, and I guess now it's possible someone'll decide to break into my car if I leave it lying around, but still. Is good. I've never spent so much money all at once before. I feel so grown up."

"event","So one day of living alone and already I've injured myself. God! I forgot to turn the fan over the stove on and managed to set off the smoke detectors. I muted the first one ok, but forgot that I had two, so I thought that I'd just managed to reduce the volume somehow. Spent a little while wrestling with it, managed to take the battery out to no effect, which confused the hell out of me, then decided to just bury it in bedding and towels to muffle the sound. So I set off down the hallway, where the sound just got louder, and that's when I realised there was a second detector (I don't set them off very often, and I'm just going to assume that my flatmate was doing the weekly checks to make sure they were functioning. Tonight proves they were, anyway). So I moved a chair into the hallway, got up on it and silenced the second one. Couldn't get it loose to take out the battery (just until the smoke cleared, of course), but luckily it didn't set itself off again. I turned on the fans and opened the windows and it all cleared up. Meanwhile my food got pretty burnt. I'm not sure if that's ironic or not.

Anyway, the injury: Just now I set off down the hallway from my room to the kitchen. The light was off. Suddenly, something struck my shins! I'd left the chair there! Down we both went! I managed to get an arm to the ground and not fall completely, but I hit my shins, one of my forearms, and managed to get a poke in the ribs from one of the chair legs. So there I was, rolling on the floor thinking about that episode of 30 Rock where Liz almost chokes to death alone in her apartment. But I'm ok now."

"event","So my flatmate moved out yesterday. I am living alone! But not for long. Hopefully. I need to find someone to go into the other room. Anybody know anybody? I had a friend actually just get kicked out of his place, who attends Murdoch uni (just around the corner, really), and is in all ways perfect for the room, but alas, he's decided to temporarily go back to his parents' and save up some monies.

Anyway, the result of the move out was that I suddenly had no tea towels or cooking utensils. Which I didn't realise last night until I was already halfway into cooking dinner. It was like, how am I going to do anything with all this stuff I just stuck in the frypan? How am I going to dry these mushrooms I just washed? Not to mention my hands! So today it was off into Fremantle to buy replacement stuff. Also I got some eggcups, which weren't a replacement as we didn't have any before.

There's a lot of people in Freo on a sunday! Especially on a day like today when there's some kind of parade going on and the streets were closed to cars (I parked like a million miles out of town, but I would've anyway 'cause I'm too cheap to pay for parking). Plus there were these big banging sounds that I'm pretty sure were explosives of some kind being set off, like every five or ten minutes for ages. No idea what that was about. Hopefully we weren't being invaded. I'd feel a real tool if I just carried on my commerce while the town was being took over.

Anyway, on my way out of Freo I found myself crossing Norfolk Street at the intersection with South Terrace (I think that was the intersection, anyway. The one where the Norfolk Hotel is). There was me, a woman pushing a pram, and a dude on crutches waiting to cross. This is a pretty bad intersection, I think, mainly due to how much foot traffic it gets and the way the lights change. I very nearly hit someone in my car once when they stepped right out in front of me when I had a green light. Luckily I was in a car with pretty good brakes and stopped just short of them. Anyway, today me and this couple didn't have the green pedestrian light, but we jaywalked halfway across to the island when there was a break in turning traffic off South. At this point I looked over at the light for the westbound traffic on Norfolk (the lanes I was about to cross) and saw that, although the light to go straight was red, there was a green arrow to go left. So I looked left and saw that there was a car coming up in the left lane planning to turn. So I stopped at the island. The woman with the pram and the guy on crutches kept going. Luckily, the driver of the car was paying attention to her surroundings (unlike these two pedestrians) and managed to stop without hitting them or their pram. These two carry on to the other side of the street.

""Lucky she stopped"", say the woman. ""Asian driver""

""Yeah, they usually don't"", says the man.

So, in the spirit of Amy's blog in the spirit of Jess and Az's blogs, I present the following:

Dear Woman With Pram and Man On Crutches,
Why don't you pay some attention to what you're doing when you cross the street with your baby? How dare you make racist remarks about the woman who just saved your baby's life, which had been endangered by your own stupidity? If that car had hit you or your pram, it would have been entirely your own fault for crossing against the lights. If you want to endanger yourself, well, whatever, but you have no business involving your innocent child, not to mention the emotional trauma the driver would have suffered had you not been so lucky and her so competent. You should be ashamed.

I kind of wish I'd said something, but I wussed out. I'm pretty sure I could have outrun them both if they really took offence (which I'm pretty sure they would have)."

"event","So I think the most important part of teaching yourself to cook through trial and error is to not use any ingredients which have the potential to poison you if cooked incorrectly. With that in mind I guess the sausages tonight were a mistake. But I think I can manage sausages. If I'm sick tomorrow I guess we'll have been shown otherwise. Anyway, tonight's dish:

<b>Bangers and mash (and asparagus)</b>

OK, this is obviously a fairly easy one. But I put other vegetables in the mash! So it's complicated a bit?

Preparation time: The length of the first thirteen tracks of the Mountain Goats' <i>Protein Source of the Future, Now!</i> compilation (appropriate, I guess, since there's soy in this, but also not all that appropriate since there's lamb).

Ingredients: Lamb and herb sausages (4 (quantity and type of sausage open to variation)), potato (2), carrot (1), asparagus (3 shoots), onion (1 half), butter beans (however many are left in the can), garlic (some), soy milk (some), water (enough), the finest olive oil (a bit).

Implements: Knife, cutting board, fork x2, pot, steaming pot (or whatever it's called, it goes above the other pot and has holes in the bottom), pot lid, kettle, frying pan, bowl (microwave safe), stove (I used gas, but it probably doesn't matter too much), plate.

Method:
1. Boil the water in the kettle (in my mind this is quicker than doing it on the stove). While that's happening, cut the potatoes into little bits (leave the skins on).
2. Transfer the water to the pot, put it on the stove, set stove high enough to keep it boiling. Add the potatoes to the pot, stick the steaming thing on top and chuck in the asparagus (I kind of suspect the asparagus may have turned out better boiled, but who knows)
3. Start cutting the carrot, onion, and garlic into little tiny pieces (this is probably not the right way to use garlic, I don't know). Try not to cry. You haven't cried more than a drop or two in like ten years, and now is no time to start.
4. Put the frypan on the stove with some oil in it and the stove on. Add the sausages.
5. At some point add the carrot, onion and garlic to the frypan. Leave the sausages in there, having all that vegetable matter in there will make it easier to get them to sit where you want.
6. By this time the potatoes are probably done enough. Pick a piece out with the fork, run it under the cold tap for a second so it doesn't burn you and put it in your mouth. Is it soft enough? Now do you realise that running it under the tap will cool the outside but won't help with the boiling temperature inside?
7. If the potato is done, take the asparagus from the steaming thing and put it on a plate or something, then use the steaming thing to strain the potato. Efficient! Whack the potato back in the pot you boiled it in and start mashing it with a fork because you don't own a potato masher (weak).
8. Somewhere around here chuck the butter beans into the frypan, along with that gross fluid they come in. Stir, obviously.
9. Stick some soy milk in the bowl and put it in the microwave for a minute or so (this is probably better done in a pot on the stove, but you're not made out of pots) (apparently adding cold milk to mash will muck it up. Whatever), then add it to the mash. Stir it in. If you got the quantity right, you'll get a nice creamy mix. If, as is more likely, you put in too much, you'll have something that looks kind of like soup. In this case, turn the heat back on to steam it out a bit and hope for the best.
10. Right, the sausages are probably done by now. Cut one in half to be sure if you want. Looks good. Take them out of the pan and onto the plate. Stir the vegetable stuff around a bit.
11. Add the vegetables to the mash. Stir. Looks a bit less soupy now, right? Better turn off the heat.
12. Scoop some of the mash onto the plate. If you're living the lonely life and only cooking for one, you've probably got way too much mash. That's cool. You can stick it in the fridge probably and then maybe forget to eat it until it goes nasty.

Results: Man, these are nice sausages. Cooked exactly right, too. Damn! The asparagus hasn't really come off as hoped, although that one piece was really nice. The mash is a bit odd. Dunno if that's the fault of the soy milk (the too much soy milk, that is, your previous experiences with soy mash have been pretty great) or the beans. Or something else. Maybe you should have chucked in some margerine or something. Anyway, there are no poisonous components, so you should get away with it.

Update: Turns out the mash, once chilled, is way nice. Sweet!"

"event","So I'm looking into nursing in Canada. I guess I'd like to go somewhere, and I guess Canada seems like a pretty good place to go. I'm thinking maybe do a year there, that sort of thing. That way, when someone says to me, ""What's that accent of yours?"", I can say ""Oh, I lived in Canada for a while."", which is a much better answer than my current ""I think I watched too much TV as a child."". Also, maybe I'll run into Scott Pilgrim over there.

Anyway, I don't really know a great deal about nursing in Canada (or, when you really get down to it, Canada itself). Hence the research, I guess. The main thing I wanna know right now is what's the typical nurse/client ratio (obviously there are factors involved in this - when I was working wards, my typical ratio was one to four-six, where when I was in high dependency, it was one to one-two, and in a high school I was in recently it was one to thirteen hundred, if you want to consider every student to be a client). I've heard from nurses from other countries that you often get like three times as many patients overseas, which is a bit daunting but presumably counteracted by differing ways of running a hospital.

From the looks of it, to get a Visa I need to have a job lined up. To be eligible to work in Canada I have to pass an exam and then arrange registration with the governing body of whichever part of the country I want into. It looks like to do the exam you have to be in the country already. There's a limit of three attempts, but I tend to be pretty good at written work. Guess I'd have to study first, figure out how it all works over there. It'd be a shame to line up a job, make the trip, and then not make the grade to be able to work.

Anyway, I guess we can consider this entry a declaration of intent. I would like to travel with my work sometime, preferably not too far into the future, and currently I'm looking at going somewhere cold. Of course, I'm just doing this nursing thing until my <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thehundredthousandfireflies"">band</a> takes off, so if I'm a rock star before all this happens, I guess that'll put the kybosh on the whole thing.

Meanwhile, I'm listening to Star Time. James Brown makes some pretty good music, but I don't know if I really need five hours of it at a go. Also, the man can be hilarious. ""Red, man, what kind of horn you play?"". ""I'm not gonna ask you to play, Jack, 'Cause your horn is too big. Man, you got too much horn over there."" I wish I could run a band like that."

Wound up walking a big chunk of it, though. I was on the way back home and I found myself at the bottom of a big hill and I just couldn't see myself cycling up it. Nice walk after that, though. I saw a man sitting with a dog. The dog's looking away and the guy reaches over and grabs this black thing away from the dog. Since the dog has black fur I hadn't noticed the object. The dog starts running around trying to get it back. The guy looks over at me and smiles. It was nice.

On top of that, I found a dollar on the ground, and a copy of Gauntlet Legends for N64 that was out on the street for roadside collection.

"event","Dad came around today to take away the bathtub. A new one's coming in this week. While he was here he pointed out his dissatisfaction with how we've been upkeeping the place, which is fair. I've been lazy. He also pointed out a tree visible through one of the windows, and how nice it's gonna look come spring and how much it's grown since he was living here. It got me thinking about autumn, despite it being the opposite of spring. I guess it was the skeletal tree that did it. Anyway, the way that this kicked in was a desire to play an autumnal video game. Sad, I know. I guess that maybe stems from firstly it not being autumn at the moment, and the fact that as an adult I can't interact with real autumn the way I did as a kid. There's probably a difference in how I interact with games, too, but I guess there's an opportunity to reexperience the exact same thing with something static like that, unlike the real world.

Anyway, the game that first sprung to mind was <i>Soleil</i> for the Mega Drive. That's pronounced So-Li-El, by the way, not So-Lei or however you'd spell out the correct pronunciation, because when I first got the game I was not particularly familiar with the idea of French. Actually I can remember the day I bought the game. Got it from Target in Fremantle. Also the first day I had mango Hubba-Bubba bubble gum. That was in winter, I think, or at least it was overcast, and I have a feeling it was a thursday morning, so it must've been school holidays. Anyway, the part of the game I'm thinking of I suspect was actually a winter bit, but it had the right feeling. Also there may have been a change of seasons? I replayed Soleil maybe a year or two ago. To my surprise, I found myself playing through the whole game in one sitting. I guess it's just that good.

I'm sure there've been other games that felt autumnal to me, but I can't think of any. Google didn't help, though I probably just can't think of the right search terms. ""Pixel autumn"" turned up a few things, but nothing like what I wanted."

I'm really bad at ironing.

I had a sore throat for a few days at first and I thought maybe I'd damaged it singing on thursday night (which would have been totally worth it because we were t3h r0x0r on thursday night).

Anyway! In my defence, one of the fast food meals was leftovers (pizza), and most of the others were in company, before or between movies. Still. Badly in need of a trip to the shops.

Meanwhile, I don't suppose anyone's read a comic (probably online somewhere I think) which takes place at a rock show and features a scene in a lav where an angel or something tells the singer that God really doesn't like the band's music? I think the band was about to break up anyway? I'm trying to remember who it was by, what it was called, etc. OK edit: I found it. World End Solution, Bryan Lee O'Malley."

I don't really like food shopping. When I go to the checkout, I feel like people are gonna be thinking ""Man, look at how that dude lives! Shocking!"" or some such. Of course, as a fortune cookie once told me, I'd worry less about what people thought of me if I realised how little they did.

My upstairs neighbours (I think, it's hard to judge direction through the walls and floors) woke me up again last night with a litany of curses and grunts that I'm pretty sure were the byproducts of the physical act of love. Much worse than their music, but slightly better than the night before when I was awoken by dreams of being covered in ants. Still though, there's a privacy issue, partly in that I guess I involuntarily invaded theirs, but more so in that they invaded mine, even unknowingly. You've got to be considerate when you live in apartments!"

I've put one Kaki King song in the ""Music:"" box, but in fact the song I'm listening to is ""Life Being What It Is"". I listed the other one because its name appears as a line in the film. I assume Kaki is referring to the movie, but perhaps they are both referring to something else. When I first heard ""Life Being..."" I thought, ""My God, a Cannanes reference!"". Then I looked it up, and in fact it appears that both the Cannanes and Kaki King are referring to Paul Gauguin (The Cannanes song in question is called ""Owerwhelmed"" (not a typo, that's how it's spelled in the packaging), and is very much recommended)."

Had all the makings of a pretty rubbish shift: Sunday afternoon, for one thing, when all rational minded people are not at work, up the end of the ward that's been a madhouse all week, the morning nurse I took over from (who has sometimes almost yelled at me for not doing tiny things) apologising for the stuff she'd not had time to get to (I perhaps should have reminded her that that excuse didn't seem to work for me when she was the afternoon staff and I the morning (or perhaps of the time she was angry that I'd not given antibiotics at eight o'clock that hadn't been prescribed until twelve forty-five), but I guess that's just not how I roll), I had to give an enema, the cafeteria was closed by the time I got to my dinner break so dinner was a vending machine biscuit (supposedly they close at three on weekends, but I've worked a lot of saturday arvos and rarely brought my own food), I didn't actually finish until twenty minutes past my scheduled clock-off (which is to say, nine hours and ten minutes before my next scheduled clock-on), but I actually finished up in a good mood. There's just something about my job. On paper it looks naff, but once in a while it all goes right, even when it's all going wrong, and makes you feel nice. Maybe it was one of the patients at the other end of the ward telling me she wished I was her nurse tonight instead of who she had, maybe it was when one of my patients insisted I do her dressing before I go because she didn't want it getting done by someone else later (I honestly would never have expected people to prefer to have me over someone else as their nurse, so it's all very shocking and quite an ego boost), but when it comes down to it, the highlight of my night was another man's poo. What has my life become?"

"event","So I more or less by accident bought a keyboard today. Musical keyboard, I mean. Well, I tell a lie. I've been in the market for a keyboard for a while. I was driving along around five o'clock thinking ""I need to get out of this traffic"" when I noticed I was near a music shop. Being in the market for a keyboard, I went to take a look. Suddenly I found myself buying something. I think I did it just to spite the sales assistant, whose ""assistance"" seemed designed to prevent purchases. Quite a sneaky sales pitch, I must say. I very much doubt he was actually spited by my patronage.

So, my new keyboard. Here's a top notch pitch from the manufacturer's website: ""It will fill the gap of the particular hardware for composing cell phone ring, which has the market of billions of dollar."" Sweet! I want a piece of that pie!

I had no idea when purchasing the device that it was intended for use as a mobile phone ring tone composition device. You'd think that would be a bit of a niche market. Anyway, the keyboard itself is four octaves long and about an inch wider than the keys, which means it fits pretty much perfectly in the top drawer of my desk. Unfortunately I don't think it'll be practical cable-wise to keep it there, but I may be able to figure out something. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be used as a MIDI controller, but it's also got a built in tone generator and speaker. Basically I was looking for something I could use to mess about at home that wouldn't take up too much space, and it seems to fit that category."

As it happens, they offered me the two places I nominated as my first preferences. So I accepted the offer.

The combined best/worst thing about this is that both of my placements (Population health and the OT) are office hours. No more working every weekend (I've had two saturdays and two sundays off since november, and never in the same weekend). But no more penalty rates. Goodbye, income."

Killing time at the moment. I start on night shift tomorrow evening, so I'm gonna stay up until four tonight and sleep until hopefully mid afternoon so that I don't collapse on the job. Not sure if it's going to work or if I'll just wind up more tired. I got up at eight this morning after going to bed at one and not sleeping well. I had an appointment for nine o'clock to pick up my fancy earplugs (they're crazy: everything goes quiet, but sound is otherwise unmolested. Of course, won't know for sure until I try them at band practice). I made the appointment for nine because I knew I was going on nights this week but didn't realise it wouldn't be until thursday. I figured I could pick them up after work.<br><br>Since my shifts don't start until thursday (they don't really need the extra night staff until friday, so what my manager did was put two of my first week's shifts this week (friday and sunday) and move the other two over into next week, so that I was doing seven shifts in eight days (and eight in ten), which is well naff. I complained, which is why I start on thursday now, but it's still not a great roster) I actually had four days off in a row (if you count tomorrow), a first since october. This was somewhat ruined by having an interview about my ward placements for my second year of work being on tuesday, stressing me out for the first two days off. I'm trying to recapture the aimless slackery I used to get up to in my uni days. I don't know if it's full time work that's draining or if it's the shift work nature of it (lately I've had the bad habit of collapsing into a nap after morning shifts, waking up feeling awful and then not being able to get to sleep so that the same thing happens the next day). I guess the constant feeling that there's something I should be doing. Even today was a pretty successful slacking day but I accomplished a few things: got my bike, got my earplugs, paid my car rego, sorted some stuff with the bank. I think I did laundry, too (what I didn't do was the shopping, which is gonna be a bit difficult when I'm sleeping all day. Better do it tomorrow).<br><br>Anyway, back to the bike. Man, I'm not in good shape. Which is a lot of the reason I wanted to get a bike. The bike's pretty large (as is the helmet, which I had to get the bike shop to get in special for me 'cause my melon is so big), but the bulk of the weight comes from me. I guess it'll get easier with time. I rode it from the bike shop back to Mum's place, less than a kilometer, and boy howdy was I stuffed when I got off it. Embarassing, really (in my defence: mostly uphill, pretty hot today).<br><br>Assuming I stick with it, I guess I decrease my risk of death from heart disease and so on (in the long run. In the short term, though it's still unlikely, I've probably got a better chance of the ticker giving out on me if I start working it more), but I increase my chance of injury, too. Man alive, I do not want acquired brain injury. Or spinal injury. Or degloving injury, the most horrific concept I've become aware of lately (degloving injury can be, but is not necessarily, what it sounds like)."

It's the after hours doc for the evening, and he tells me he's got a page about something which I won't go into because confidentiality/whatever. It's the first I've heard of it, so I tell him I'll find that patient's nurse. Alright, he says, and could you tell that nurse that when they page a doctor they should stay near the phone? And he says it like this nurse has commited the most grievous sin imaginable. First off, for all he knows the nurse is standing next to me. Second off, it's not anything I did, there's no need to take that tone with me. Third off, ok, you can categorise pages you send to doctors into two types: emergency and non. So if it's not an emergency, you might hear back in ten minutes, or two hours, or never. So you're not gonna sit by the phone for a call that might never come. If they call, someone'll get it and find you. If it is an emergency, you're not gonna sit by the phone, you're gonna deal with the emergency. So what I'm saying is, get stuffed, you stuck up doctor, you. We were busy tonight, and we don't have time for your bullshit impatience. I'm sure you're busy too, but at least I was polite. Of course, what I actually said was ""yeah"" and then I kept the message to myself when I found the nurse (who was about ten metres away).

Ah, whinge whinge whinge. We had an emergency about ten minutes after I was due to clock off, just as I was finishing the last thing I needed to do before going home (like I say, busy tonight).

Since I changed wards three weeks ago (fifteen shifts) I've been sent to different wards for the shift four times. It is t3h 5ux0r. What I get for going to a ward with too many staff in a time of not enough staff, I guess. I've actually been sent to the same ward three times, and I'm starting to get used to the place and know who a few of the other staff there are, so it's not too bad, though that's where I went today and it was rubbish. The main problem being that I had to spend two hours on something for the benefit of all patients, which meant I was neglecting my patients for that time. Never really caught up. Or got to my first tea break. Weak!

Anyways. Living in new digs now. Out of home at the grand old age of twenty-four. Go me! Is not too bad. I miss the drum kit, of course, but I feel kind of like a grown-up. As a housewarming gift to myself I got <i>The Complete Calvin and Hobbes</i> (italics for book titles? Pretty sure), which is perhaps not so grown up, though not as bad as the fact that when I moved in roughly half of my luggage was DVDs, books, and video games. Actually aside from clothes, food, and a few items of furniture that's still pretty much all I've got. Really must get around to bringing over my CDs.

I'm thinking of getting a bicycle. I gave blood last week and they almost didn't let me 'cause my resting pulse was so high. I think it was mostly nerves about the needle (I can dish it out, but I can't take it back), but my heart does seem to be going a bit faster than it needs to most of the time. Better get in shape. The area I'm living in now isn't too hilly. Last time I tried to cycle it was really hard, but I was going uphill and it was a bike I got for I think eight bucks that probably hadn't had any maintenance in years. I figure under better conditions I may be able to get myself into a condition where I can tolerate some exercise.

Sort of figure out some new thing I can't live without everyday. Today, sitting on the couch with a drink, I realised I need to get some end tables. Or a coffee table, I guess. Before we can get a coffee table though we need to get something to put the telly on up off the floor."

I didn't actually realise until I was in the Cashies carpark about to set off home that the <i>God Hand</i> cover is an imitation of the classic cover of <i>My Hero</i>. Most Master System games have pretty questionable covers, to be honest, but this one is right on. Actually, pretty much everything about <i>My Hero</i> is right on. It's so damn good. I was well chuffed to find it for five bucks.

I've not actually played <i>God Hand</i> yet, but from what I understand of it, it's pretty similar to <i>My Hero</i>. You hurt a lot of people, and the game is tough as nails. I was surprised when reading the <i>My Hero</i> manual today to find that the game has frog and remote controlled car enemies. Guess I never got that far. Also, the hero's name is Steve. I kind of liked him better anonymous, though.

It's a shame that the manual doesn't list the staff, since there's no way I'll ever make it to the credits sequence of <i>My Hero</i>, so I can never find out if they had the same cover artist.

Fun fact: I attempted a while ago to get my ROM hack on and convert <i>My Hero</i> to <i>My Heroine</i>, basically by changing the sprite tiles a bit so that the thug would kidnap the boy instead of the girl at the start, and then the girl would go rescue him. But I couldn't find the tiles for anything except the title screen, so it never really got going. I don't actually know how to hack ROMs.

The black bar is there because it's a pretty awful photo, especially cut like that. Admittedly, this hair was achieved by driving around with the windows open (the air con's died again), but it was all a bit much. So I went to a place, and this happened:

I also got a copy of <i>The Big Issue</i>, the only magazine I buy with any regularity, which I get pretty much whenever I see a vendor with an issue I haven't got already. Today though I went out of my way to find one so I'd have something to read with lunch. Unfortunately I didn't take a photo of my lunch (fast Chinese food), or the vanilla coke I had with it, so you'll have to use your imagination there. As you can see, it was a big day for games. Two more for the Master System, another beat-em-up and a DS game. Plus some Astroboy!

I realise this is probably kind of a dull entry. Sorry. To make it up to you, I'll remind you to check the alt text of the first picture (I know alt text isn't supposed to be used for titles, but I just copied the code over verbatim from the image hosting place, and I guess they're not up on their HTML specifications. Matter of fact, I'll go back and fix that, making this aside somewhat out of date). Pun not intentional, believe it or not, but leaving it there certainly is, because it's an awesome pun. So there."

"event","So I have, arguably, two jobs. Go me! A big step up from years of no jobs.

<b>Nursing</b>
Nursing is kind of tough. The hours are no fun, there's a lot of responsibility and pressure, the pay could be better (though, as a person who's been broke since he was fifteen, it's pretty good), you've got to deal with upsetting situations, smelly situations, frightening situations. There's some stress involved. The hospital always seems to be short staffed, so sometimes we've got more patients to look after than we should, and sometimes they bring in staff from agencies or on overtime who don't do full length shifts so the regulars have to make up the difference, sometimes you hit the off button instead of snooze and only wake up when the coordinator calls you at home half an hour after the start of the shift to find out where you are and by then traffic's bad and you get in an hour and a half late (that would be this morning - oops). It seems like, on my ward at least, a lot of the patients have chronic conditions that aren't going to get better, only worse. So they start out coming into hospital for a short while then going home for a long while, and gradually it reverses, and then you don't see them anymore. Though I've been at it less than six months, so I haven't really seen that much of that.

Rewarding, though, right? Well. I don't know. Sometimes. I'm pretty sure I like the job. No plans to quit. It chews up your life, though. Shift work and all. You do get some interesting stories out of it. Gotta be careful telling them, of course. Confidentiality. And, most of them are about poo. I have seen some impressive poo at work. 

But then the other day we had a patient about to be discharged, and she was telling me how great all us staff were. Kind of embarrassing, really, but that was pretty nice.

<B>The Hundred Thousand Fireflies</b>
This one's a bit different. I guess the stakes are somewhat lower, and I'm maybe a bit higher on the food chain in this organization than at the hospital. There's a lot less money in it (actually tomorrow I'm going instrument shopping, might get a new guitar (though I like the old one), and looking at drum kits, either of which would cost more than the band's brought in in total, making it a negative money-maker). Can be stressful. It's a bit nerve-wracking to bring in new stuff at practice. Perhaps more so on stage. We opened with a new song at our last show (for all of twelve punters), I thought I was going to have a heart attack. But it's pretty great too. We seem to be past the point where practices involve shouting matches, which is nice. I guess we get to be creative. When I'm old, I'll have the photos. And videos.

The two jobs kind of conflict, unfortunately. I've spent every weekend since november (I think) in the hospital, which hasn't allowed much time for practice, which can usually only take place on weekends because of the others' schedules. Still, people keep telling us we're playing better at each show. Weird."

"event","So I'm trying to start up a thing on the MySpace. I have admittedly got one already, but that's for my band. This one's for my me. Actually I'm doing it as an artist thing (though I feel uncomfortable calling myself an artist, and double uncomfortable applying it to a lot of other ""artists""), the plan being to put up some stuff that the band isn't using, either because they rejected it, because it's not suitable (that is, if it's 30 seconds long and is bass guitar/voice only and I like it that way, etc.), or because I haven't had a chance to take it to practice yet and I'd like to put it somewhere where the others can get an idea of it first.

Anyways. So I go to the site, and I hit signup. And I'm wondering, where's the bit where you choose whether you're a person or an artiste? Turns out you've actually gotta start from a different part of myspace to get that. How user friendly. So now I've deleted my personal profile, but it won't let me start a new one because I'm trying to use the same email adress and they haven't sent me the email to confirm that I want out of the personal profile yet. A cooling off period, I guess, to give you a chance to reconsider the terrible mistake you're making (the email they send when you join I got immediately). Except now it's stopping me from making the terrible mistake of signing up again.

Thank the lord I don't have real problems to deal with.

This next bit I wrote a while ago, then wrote off. But when I went to write this entry it asked if I wanted to restore, and I did. Enjoy:

Holy Moley, Billy Bragg. Coming to the big day out, which is one part awesome, one part aww man now I gotta go to the big day out. So anyway, Levi Stubbs' Tears. First Billy Bragg song that I noticed, I saw the video somewhere, was struck by the fairly unusual man and electric guitar only thing (plus trumpet at the end). There's also what sounds like a tambourine and some kind of hand drums on the album version, but I think they're not in the video. Anyway, I got the compilation of the first few releases somewhere along the way, was kind of disappointed to not find the song I'd seen on it (not knowing the name of the song at the time). But gosh darn, A New England, etc. Anyways, maybe a week back I got Talking With The Taxman. It is, in fact, more difficult than the earlier stuff, bizarrely because it's got more instrumentation. When I say more difficult, the first time I listened to it I was a bit disappointed, and then about two listens later I was like God Damn!

Anyways. Yesterday I stuck the song Levi Stubbs' Tears on repeat for a while. Each time it ended I thought maybe I should listen to the rest of the album now, but then it would start over and I'd think maybe next time. The narrative is slightly confusing, mainly in the first verse. What accident? The thing where her husband put a hole in her body where no hole should be (I read somewhere that the line was inspired by an old cop show, but I can't find the reference now) doesn't sound like an accident."

Making a mix tape to relax a bit. Also because I'm a bit tired of the one in my car at the moment.

I think I'm more nervous about this one, because I expected the campus band competition to go badly (it did, by the way, in the sense that we lost, but on the other hand I thought the performance was ok, they just didn't get us (maaan)). This show's gonna have the sort of audience that we've got the best chance with (i.e. a fair number of them will be people we know). 'Course, I say I was less nervous, but I stalled my car twice driving to campus bands, which I haven't done in a long while.

"event","So: I start at the hospital on Monday (btw, you will now refer to me as ""Jim, RN""). I had my last shift in pizza delivery a few nights ago. Meantime, I'm having a big Saturday night in on teh intirwubs. Hooray!

Anyways, I thought I might take this chance to pass on what I've learned as a pizza guy, in an entry I'd like to call ""How to order delivery pizza without being a jerk"" (though the subject line of this entry will remain blank).

<lj-cut text=""How to order delivery pizza without being a jerk""><b>How to order delivery pizza without being a jerk:

On the phone:</b>
  - Speak clearly. Obviously. Exceptions if you've got a reasonable reason for not speaking clearly, like if English is your second language or you've recently had dental surgery.
  - Be polite.
  - Don't complain about the price. I don't set the price. If it's that much of a problem just lie about having a coupon. On the phone, I can't actually see whether you've got a coupon or not. Of course, whoever delivers the pizza might make a fuss. You've got to take your chances.
  - Figure out what you want before you call. Nothing better than standing there for four minutes while you ask everyone in the house what they want.
  - Figure out where you live before you call. Shouldn't be that hard.

<b>In your home:</b>
  - Don't rob me. I hate being robbed. Actually the only time someone tried to rob me, I was like ""No way"", and then a crowd of people came along the footpath and he backed off. But he was totally a jerk.
  - Have your street number clearly displayed where it can be seen by someone approaching in a car from either direction at night in the rain. This is the most important thing, aside from don't rob me. I don't know why people even bother to put up a number when it's behind a tree, an inch tall, the same colour as the wall it's on, and has a light behind it so that you can't actually see it at all anyway. But at least once I've gotten out of the car and walked up to it and shined a light on it I know I'm at the right place before I knock on the door.
  - Answer the door. Seriously, I'd like to know I'm at the right place, even if you haven't got the money ready yet.
  - Have the money ready. I've got other people to deliver to than you, and I don't appreciate being on your doorstep while you get two bucks from everyone at the party.
  - Don't argue with me over the price. They told you what it would cost on the phone. Anyway, I'd like to see you prepare a meal and take it to my door for less than $20.
  - Don't insult my intelligence over vouchers. I don't want to get into an argument with you, and if you just don't mention the voucher I probably won't even ask for it. Don't tell me you really do have it, you just don't know where it went, 'cause I'll get offended and start acting like a jerk myself, and insist you pay full price. And don't try and bribe me. If I wanted to steal from my employer, I could say that people who paid full price had vouchers and the difference would be mine. Your offer of two dollars tip is not enough for me to sell out my non-thiefing principles, and again, I'm offended.
  - If you knew the intercom at your gate didn't work, and you never answer the phone, how exactly did you expect me to get past the gate and deliver your pizza? So I leave a message on your voicemail and head back to the store. When I get there you're on the phone to the manager. When he gets off the phone, he says ""What a moron. But we'd better get them pizzas back out there."" 
  - I'm not a pizza boy. I'm 23 years old, and I have a beard. I am a pizza man (I was a pizza man, now I'm a murse).
  - Don't be racist. Actually pretty good advice in most situations.
  - If you're in a shop or other business, tell us the name of the business as well as the street address. Believe it or not, the ten foot tall letters over your door are easier to spot than the street number that you don't have displayed.
  - If I'm late, it's almost certainly not my fault. We're busy, half the staff called in sick, someone in the store put mushroom on when you said no mushroom and we had to remake the pizza, you gave us the wrong address and I've had to drive here from your old place three suburbs over after calling you on my mobile (at my own expense), you haven't got a number on your letterbox or anywhere else, someone stole the sign for your street, you didn't leave a light on, etc, etc. If I'm late, then I'm already having a bad night and I don't need you to let me know about it. Sure, sometimes I'm the one who messed up, but usually it's beyond my control.
  - Tip. Not strictly necessary (though I've heard that in more primitive cultures you're supposed to tip because service isn't included, or something), but I'll forgive many transgressions for a few dollars more.

Also, this isn't strictly related to pizza delivery, but you basically never actually need to use your high beams when you're driving, at least in the suburbs. Sure, you turn them off when you see oncoming traffic, but in the time it takes to do that I'm already blinded. And if you're behind someone and you turn on the beams, they go straight through the rear windscreen into the rear view mirror which efficiently directs them straight into the driver's eyes. This also happens if you're in a car whose lights are positioned high enough to go straight in, especially if you're tailgating. Don't drive like a jerk, and get a smaller car, you tool.

Also again, if you ever start working at a pizza store, remember to keep the pizza box horizontal while it's got pizza in it. I know that on SBS's <i>Pizza</i> they carry it under their arm on its side, but if you do that in real life it'll collapse in on itself, or at least the side with the toppings on it'll fall against the lid. You would think it was obvious, but a lot of people ruin a pizza this way when they first start."

"event","Well sir or madam, it has surely been a while, but I return in the spirit of continuity, and with video(!).

Last I wrote I mentioned the upcoming ruinage of a new year's party by the band what I'm in. Am I being too harsh on myself (and the others)? YOU DECIDE!

So here we have four songs, on video, taped on the evening. Sound quality is surprisingly good, but I can't say the same for the video, on account of it was pretty dark and I cut the file sizes down to five meg or less and compression has not been kind. I've tried to watch these in three programs; they looked pretty alright in Media Player Classic on the other computer, kind of not so great in Winamp on my computer and there was no visual, only sound in MPC on my comp. Make of that what you will. I know very little of digital video. The starts of songs are missing because the cameraman was pausing between songs.

So: we have
<ul><li type=circle><a href=""http://www.arach.net.au/~cherylbovell/alpha.wmv"">Alpha</a><br>Alpha's about beer ads and men's magazines and those Lynx (Axe overseas, I think?) ads, which I think the song predates. Basically I'm not into that kind of masculinity. It was the second song we played, and the first that didn't involve shouting ""I hate you with a passion baby"", and I'm not really used to being able to hear myself sing (borrowed a PA for it), so my voice is awful, and breaks amusingly at the start of the second verse. The second verse is still kind of underwritten.<li type=circle><a href=""http://www.arach.net.au/~cherylbovell/Don't.wmv"">Don't</a><br>Don't is probably the best song as far as the instrumental parts go. We bought new hi-hat cymbals the day of the show, so it sounded better probably than ever before. I guess this is the one I recommend if you're thinking ""should I even bother?"". <li type=circle><a href=""http://www.arach.net.au/~cherylbovell/sob.wmv"">Sob Story</a><br>Sob Story is about an argument I had with a guy. I wrote it the next day when I was still pissed off. Kind of seems excessive now. It's called Sob Story 'cause the guy kept telling me he didn't want to hear my sob stories. Arsehole. I screw up about four times in this song, at least. It's pretty obvious when it happens, but if you're not sure, the screw-ups are when I cut out halfway through a line and swear off-mic.<li type=circle><a href=""http://www.arach.net.au/~cherylbovell/line.wmv"">Line</a><br>Line is a song that I always kind of thought of as filler but which actually ended up being not that bad. Camera was on pause for the first verse, so that's missing.</ul>
I haven't spoken to the other guys (Az, aka <lj user=""frankenchokey"">, and my brother Ben, who also has an LJ but I don't read it for privacy reasons or whatever, so you'll have to find it on your own) about putting these up, so maybe they'll be upset. Sorry Az (Ben, in theory, won't be reading this). I guess it goes without saying that, even if you really want to, we'd appreciate it if you didn't steal our stuff.

Also: if the links don't work, try going <a href=""http://www.arach.net.au/~cherylbovell/index.html"">here</a>. Probably won't make any difference, but it might."

"event","First performance in very close to a year at the Doctor's boxing day BBQ last night. First with new line-up, original songs, etc. New line up is actually subset of old line up. Current name: The Hundred Thousand Fireflies (thankyou Stephin Merritt). Complete shambles. We did about four songs, pretty much all badly, before this woman's all swearing at us about how her sick kid hasn't slept in four days and we aren't helping. So we stopped. I feel bad about the child, but I think the language was unnecessary. Apparently they'd yelled at us over the fence first. Didn't hear it.

So yeah, we did four numbers that I remember, being I Hate You (orig the Monks), Don't (one of our own), I Wanna Be Your Dog (Stooges (I'd have rathered done more of our own, less others', but I Hate You's too good to not open with, and Dog is what we used to be known for)), and Not That I Know Of (another of ours). Next up was Alpha, our song about gender (obviously you're supposed to write about sex, not gender, but I'm a prude) and advertising, but we were interrupted. Prolly for the best, we were shocking. Way too much drink down the hatch already. Admittedly, I've been drunk every time I've ever played the guitar in public, but this was my first time singing as well, and the other two guys are usually fairly sober, I think. When you screw up Dog, that's a bad sign.

Actually I think I may be the worst guitar player ever, but that's life, etc.

I'm awful glad that we didn't arrange any kind of recording.

On the plus side, we got an offer to play at a new year's party. Possibly as a joke, I don't know."

"event","Been a while. Sadly, nothing much to say.

My CD player is basically dead. Makes terrible noises as the discs spin up and I worry it's scratching them or something. Even when it does start to play without incident it usually gives out partway. I guess the thing's about eight or nine years old, so maybe I should expect it to be on the way out. Hopefully the replacement'll be able to handle the Buff Medways' <i>1914</i>, which seemed to be beyond the powers of the old beast even a few months ago when I got it (the CD, not the player). Perhaps I'm too much a sentimentalist, but I don't like to throw away old stuff, even when it doesn't work. My usual method is to stash stuff somewhere then leave it behind moving house or something. Don't move very often, though. Plus I can't afford a new CD player just now (gotta have a tape deck too, of course, most important, plus I guess something to play vinyl'd be nice), thanks in part to spending sixty dollars getting drunk on friday. Can't for the life of me remember spending the last twenty, but it's gone, along with my stein. Other than that, I remember somehow winding up with a gin/pepsi combination and also maybe making out with someone for a while. Pretty vague memory, that. Female, I'm pretty sure, kind of soft but quite forceful with the tongue. I think. Nobody said anything about it in the morning, so maybe it didn't happen. Hopefully it wasn't someone I know, because that can only mean awkwardness in the near future.

Not getting a lot of work done at uni. Not actually at uni, in fact, off for the rest of semester aside from assignments and stuff. But those too need to be done, especially the one due friday. I've broken my work ethic, I guess. Uni library tells me I've got a book overdue. I think I returned it over a month ago, but my memories of doing so are pretty vague, it being over a month ago and not exactly a huge life event. Can't find the thing, anyway. I called them up, they'll check if they've got it but if it doesn't turn up in three months I'm liable. I can't believe they really give you three months! Absurd. Maybe in three months I'll have somehow scraped together enough cash to afford to be liable."

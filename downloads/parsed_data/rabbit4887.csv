I don't know, I really feel frustrated and very trapped. One day I swear to God himself that I will get the hell out of here. Until that day I'll just put up with it. Ciao.

"event","Today was good I suppose...No drama...my mom now knows im friends w/asher (btw asher we met in Tower Records) and she isnt too freaked out by it...which is good. I got to see a movie in Bham and it was funny as hell! Today's quote came from it. I'll give whoever guesses it $10!! I am also planning a night out for my parents on sunday for their anniversary which was a few days ago. I dont want anyone to mention it so shhhh!! 

       At the end of the night i watched my mom, little bro and my cousin doin (or trying to do)  pilates which amused me a lot. I also read Harry Potter which is really quite good. I miss my bf a lot also :(. Oh well one day i shall see him. G'night mate.

"event","Ok i had a totally fun weekend like no other! On saturday i went to the electronic music festival and it was fun as all hell. I like that scene, the ravers are now my peoples! after my brother handed me over to my dad we went to sommerset and he let me just wander around and i went to the speedo store where i have a tiny little crush on a guy that works there and i just hung around and talked to himm a bit. After that i got home and relaxed for a bit then went to bed.

      That was Saturday btw. Today i did nothing in the morning except make chocolate-chip pancakes (which were damn good i might add!!). At about 7:00 i went to one of my cousin's wedding where i had a whole lot of fun and hung out with my cuzins and all soo i guess that is all i have to say... Thanks for Listening :)

"event","Today was awesome as all hell. I made $20 babysitting my neices and i had a lot of fun with them while i was doin that, then i went with my older brother Jason and my oldest neice to the movies to see ""Holes"" which was actually quite good. Then after the movie we went next door to a VERY small fair. After all that excitement we went to Jay's house to see his fiance and his soon to be daughter-in-law, and the pets they have. Finally we drove home and i found out that i am soo wired that i cant sleep. On Saturday me and Jay are goin to DEMPH (is that how its spelled?) in Hart Plaza! I cant wait!!

"event","Ok i am having a shitty time at school and some troubles that i need help with but i dont know who to turn to... Basically the fact that i cant make friends pisses me off a lot. It's hard for me and i dont know why. Take that added to my mom always bitching at me and giving me a 20 question quiz about people i dont even know about everytime i get picked up by her after school. And there is one more thing that is annoying me, i cant make contact with my friends on messenger! My sister and her husband ALWAYS stay up late on the weekdays so i never get to talk to the people who are on there... oh well i guess they'll just have to wait...

Afterwards i went to the Palladium in Birmingham (MI not Alabama) to see the Matrix which was truly sweet as all hell. Afterwards we walked to our car and then my mom tries to give me ""advice"" on how to make friends and she annoyed the hell out of me and i dont know im just sick of her...Oh well i hope that i will learn to make friends and be ""a cool guy"" oh well...

"event","this was my first week on WW and I lost 4.8 lbs! I didn't think I'd lose that much the first week bc I wasn't living a horribly unhealthy lifestyle before....but i'll take whatever I can get!

I just went to Publix and bought lots of WW friendly food (including WW ice cream bars, YUM).  The best time for me to shop is right after a meeting bc I'm very motivated.

Yay for successes!"

My bridal shower was today and I got lots of great stuff including a Senseo coffeemaker and really ugly towels and sheets. Thanks grandma, that's why registries were invented. I mean, Travis loves the pink towels. 

We have a mini Christmas tree with lots of ornaments made by everyone at the shower. It's adorable,
This weekend is the bachelorette party and another party/shower. Oooh-weee I'm popular.

Oh, now i must go enjoy our newly installed cable. No more rabbit ears for this gal."

"event","When old Dashboard comes on Itunes radio, something is different about this day. Everything is different about this day. It is drizzling and I am cold and warm all at the same time. My coffee won't stay warm but still burns my tongue. No one is in the office, yet everyone distracts me. I have time, but no motivation. Why do I always have one or the other?

I want my apartment to be less cluttered. But I know that I will clean it out and promptly fill it with new things. I crave candy and bread but really need to eat vegetables. And water. I need water. 

There are so many things that tire me. I am done with being tired. Tiredness is the bane of my existence. It squashes good intentions and well-laid plans. It trades time full of possibilities for restless sleep and poor moods upon waking. 

Where should I go to grad school?

What should I give my bridesmaids?

"event","It's been far too long to go too far back, so I'll just start from now, or about now.

We have a place to live!!!!!!! Woooooooo! Starting July 1st, Amy Stewart-soon-to-be-Greene will live at Signal Pointe. Yes, that's the one with the lighthouse on Howell Branch.

We started the apartment search a couple of weeks ago, thinking we had plenty of time and options. The deal is that I'll live in the apartment by myself from July til December and then Travis will move in after we get married. That way we can take our time setting the place up and I can work more on making it cute. 

We thought it would be easy to find something reasonably priced (under or around $700 for a 1 bed, 1 bath) since we had a pretty large radius that we would be willing to live it.  We actually started the search at Signal Pointe, but thought the price might be a little too high. After two full Saturdays and one half Friday of looking around the area, checking prices and availability, Signal Pointe looked mighty appealing. Nearly all the places were full. The ones that weren't were too expensive. Some places didn't have anything till February 2009 (well, thereabouts...) and some places scoffed at how early we were looking (""August?!? There's no WAY we could know if we'd have anything in AUGUST!"")  So back to Signal Pointe it was, seeing as it covered most all of our criteria: good location, pets allowed, co-signers allowed, not ridiculously priced). We ended up with the smallest of their 3 one bedroom floorplans, so at 690 sq feet, it's no palace, but we really love it.  The property has a lot of big oak trees and room for doggies to play on. Oh, and our apt is really close to the pool, laundry and mail, so that's nice. 

I think I may be 22 going on 37. Oops. 

Recently, the things I have been preoccupied with include: real estate, bridal showers, registries and paychecks. How adult am I? 

Let's be honest; all I want to do really is drive to North Carolina listening to good music and eat ice cream on a porch somewhere. I want a puppy that takes minimal responsibility and will sleep in my bed without peeing in it. I want to be at camp and not do the hard part of the job. I want to take naps when and where I want to. I want to eat what I want (candy and bagel chips) and lose weight. I want new clothes and more money. I want to live at the beach and drink margaritas every night and watch movies till 3 am. 

Yeah, that's me, honestly. 

I drove home this morning and surprised my dad for Father's Day. I could tell he was really surprised and pleased that I had driven from Orlando. It was really nice just to be with my family, even for a couple of hours. I know my dad has alot on his mind lately, with his brother and wife divorcing after 26 years of marriage. I could hear it in his voice when he called to tell me the news earlier this week. I decided that I need to do all I can to show the people in my life how much I love them and care about them.  I need to do that more often than I do. I need to think about myself far less and others far more. 

That's where I am. 

Tomorrow, I will return to 11 six year olds with the attention span of gnats, who have to pee every 3.5 seconds and throw blocks at each other and don't know how to tie their shoes. But then they'll me funny stories and draw me pictures and be so ridiculously cute and say ""miss amy, miss amy, miss amy"" and I will forget how tired they make me. 

But that's tomorrow. 

Now is writing a support letter on why people should give me money for interning this fall and perhaps reading another bridal magazine. mmmm delicious"

"event","I like The Fray. 

Today had been a not-Amyish day. Let's review: I joined a gym and went tanning. Well actually, I joined Planet Fitness cause it's $10 a month and $5 more for unlimited tanning. Since I'm graduating I don't have access to UCF's gym and I need, need, NEED to be working out so that I can be a hott, buff bride come December 29th. The tanning is something I have thought about doing for awhile. Oh, ando no one should try to convince me out of it. Yes, I know I'm a fair-baby Irish girl. I WANT TO BE TAN! or at least darker than I am. 

I really like Planet Fitness. They have this ""no-judgement zone"" policy. You have to sign a contract saying you won't drop weights or grunt and if you do, they can cancel your membership. Ahahahahahaha. Well at least I can finally use the weights and weight machines without being gawked at or made to feel uncomfortable. 

I'm done with college. Undergraduate at least. And I did it in 3 1/2 years. Ha SUCK IT Wake Forest. No no no animosity towards good ol' WFU, but c'mon. I rule. 

These past two weeks were SOOOO stressful and made me think twice about my decision to take 18 credit hours this semester. I had approximately 5 papers (one looooong one), 4 tests and 2 projects, all due like the same day.  I don't know how Travis/my roomates/my family put up with me. Luckily I was far too along to back out, so i had to just stick it out. I already know I have at least 2 As, so that's great. Even if I get a couple of Bs or even a C, finishing up this semester was so worth it. 

Now I have the summer to just work, work out, play with the fiance and enjoy summer life. 

Oh PS is it ok that I like Kenny Loggins?!?"

"event","It's been a ridiculously long time since I've written in this thing. A lot has changed since...wait let me check, January 15th. Tomorrow is MARCH 15th aka my 22nd birthday. So 2 months since I've written here. Let's get the basics sorted out first:

-Travis and I are engaged! February 8th baby. Gettin' hitched: December 29th, 2006. 

-On a similar note, my life is thus consumed by wedding planning. Ceremony and reception place and my dress are all picked out. Those are the major things that I wanted to get done ASAP as they need to be planned many months in advance.

-I graduate in May. No, I have no certain employment plans. I'm going to work this summer (pretty much whatever I can get), then intern with Wesley in the fall, get married in Dec, and get settled into married life and full-time work in January.

Yes, it IS weird. All of it. I still get waves of surreality every so often. I never thought I would meet the man I would marry this year. I never thought I would fall in love and get engaged so fast. I never thought I would get married so young. I'm okay with being proved wrong though. Especially when I know that God's sovereignty is the only hand that could have guided the last 6 or so months of my life. 
It's hard to explain that to some people. What's frustrating is that the people I need/want to be most supportive have been less than such. I know that I've always been known as the ""fiercely independent, rarely dating anyone"" type. I thought, perhaps naively, that I could be more than one thing, deeper than one dimension. Apparently (according to some), having an independent spirit and desiring earthly love are mutually exclusive. I think that couldn't be further from the truth. I have always been a hopeless romantic. I have always known that I wanted to get married and to have a family. Not everyone has to date for exactly 2 years and 2 months before they get engaged. I've always been unique, always blazed my own trail; why shouldn't my love story look different too?

I'm not really angry or hurt per se. I understand they're just trying to protect me, to look out for my best interest. I hope that they can see the truth in Travis and I's relationship; I hope they can see how in love we are. It's such a wonderful thing and I would really like to be able to share it with them

So yeah, my life is great. Right now is Spring Break. Chip and his friends are coming over soon and we're cooking up some grub. Tomorrow is my birthday and we're going to the beach and I get to see Travis (finally!) and celebrate with my wonderful family and friends. Ahhh bliss."

"event","Let's be honest: I'm impatient. I'm impatient for the things that I feel God has secured for me and is giving me glimpses of each day. Yes, yes, obviously, I understand the necessity of biding time and such, but C'MON.  I feel like I've been a semi-adult for far too long now and while being a real adult does scare me more than I'd like to admit, I am also ready to dispose of the uncertainty and limbo of right now. Onward and upward.

We had date night tonight. Went to Mimi's Cafe where I ordered the 2nd ridiculously spicy thing in 2 days and promptly drank half of Travis' rootbeer. Saw Bobby and Anna and Phil and Ashley on a double date which made us realize that we want to go on double dates. Then we saw Pride and Prejudice at the surprisingly-not-shady Picture Show at Altamonte. Yes, he wanted to see it too; i didn't drag him there. Oh wow, it was so good. I've always known that I am really Elizabeth Bennett in the wrong century, but this movie just confirmed it. Mr. Darcy, oh, Mr. Darcy. Every girl dreams that her life is a Victorian love story, right? Not that I don't have a pretty amazing love story of all my own....:)

Oh yes, Big News. I am currently typing from my new compy: a 12"" Powerbook. I think it redefines the word ""fabulous"". If I could marry a piece of electronic equipment I would soon be Mrs. Apple Powerbook. But for now I will just be obsessed with this perfect little machine and be a cliche yuppie with my Mac, Ipod and Starbucks coffee in one hand. Dear Consumer America, You have sucked me in, congratulations. 

Because all of my music is on my old computer still, I have slowly been putting on my CDs on here. Alas, right now I have like 6 done and so I have rediscovered the glory of cry-cause-you're-such-an-emo-kid Dashboard Confessional. Yeah, I realize their ridiculous kitsch. But I also don't deny that I sometimes sing along to them at the top of my lungs and want to make out with Chris Carrabba. Just hypothetically....

Christmas is over. Vacation is done. Life is slowly returning to normal. I want to make a greater effort to not let this semester pass me by like I feel like I did this fall. Not that it wasn't an amazing semester; I just don't want to fall into my normal pattern of letting months slip by unnoticed. I want these ones to soak in. 

I really love my classes so far. I think I may like my schedule, as a whole, better than any other semester.  My Senior Seminar is called ""An Interdisciplinary Study of Paul"" and the prof is a pretty famous Christian theologian and writer. This is his first class at UCF and I thought (from reading some of his works) that he would be pompous and that the class would be far more intimidating. Oh, don't get me wrong, he's crazy smart and I do thing the class will definitely be challenging. But, Crossan is not pompous in the least. Instead, he is a small Irish man that speaks with eloquence and in a manner that is insightful and not the least bit condescending or convoluted. So far, so good. 

Ugh, I have to get up in like less than 7 hours. So much for catching up on sleep during the weekends. 
Peace homies."

OH AND BOOK TICKETS FOR NEW YORK CITY!!!!!!!!!!!
It's official: January 20th-23rd. NYC   Courtney   me= par-tay. If anyone has any accommodation recommendations or general tips, send 'em my way. 
So, Thanksgiving is over and Xmas time is soon. I really really really love Xmas, but sometimes it just takes me awhile to get warmed up to the season. I think it has alot to do with having money to buy presents for people. 
Here's my official want list (yes yes I am a nerd and/or a senior citizen):

-a new watch (bc I ""lost"" my fave Swiss Army one in England)
-a subscription to the Sunday New York Times
-a subscription to Real Simple magazine

That's it. Maybe some nice makeup. or a puppy.

Me and Travi did the whole ""meet the family"" thing this weekend. I think it went really well. I beat both his mom and him in Scrabble and I think I earned lots of points for that. I mean, they're a smarty-pants family and I held my own. Thank you Jesus for triple word squares.
My parents def liked him. I mean, he is so much more quiet than all of us and coupled with the normal first time jitters, he was extra quiet. And then my friends...well we're overwhelming regardless of who you are. We talk over each other and talk about people from like 1994 that we all know. He laughed alot though. I think it'll get easier each time too. It was nice to have him in Tampa and show him my life there and all that. And it's just nice to see where he came from too.

So in the span of just this Saturday, I went to an engagement party for one of my best friends and ANOTHER one got engaged that morning! Yeah there are like 8 of us girls and 2 are engaged, one is def going to be soon, 2 of us have boyfriends....seriously WTF??? Beth Ann's wedding is in June and I bet Val will get married in August. And me..I was planning on going on some bike rides and making some crafts. Wife? no no no m'am. Maybe I AM ready to be a wife, i just don't want to realize that yet. I'll just go ahead and be 21 for now. Ok good.

also, saw lots of movies
RENT: amazing Xs a thousand
Walk the Line: so surprisingly good. i wanted to see it, but it was even better than i thought it'd be. 

Now: law school apps. 
One more week of classes. 

Dear Maury Povich, 
your show is bad for our souls. You should quit. 
thanks so much."

"event","Being home (even for a little bit) is so so so sooooooooooooooo amazing. I love my family and my house and my dog. Monica (my sister) is living with my parents for a bit while her kitchen and bathroom are renovated. And therefore, Penny Lane (her beagle) is also here. Aka I steal her and keep her in my room and play with her. She likes me. It's so great to have all 4 of us in the same house. It's been like 7 years since this has happened. And even longer since the circumstances were happy, good, normal, etc. So, yeah, life is good, on all accounts. 
What is also good is my parents' desire to spoil me when i come home. I sure don't fight it. We're going shoe shopping soon and to Target. Yes m'am. Maybe I won't overdraw my account this month. yessssssssssssssss.

I am more convinced of my quirkiness simply by the beginning of one of my playlists on Itunes. It reads as follows:
1. Medicine- Guster
2.Golddigger- Kanye West ft Jamie Foxx
3. Sand in my Shoes - Dido
4. Wedding Dress- Derek Webb
5.Part of Your Body is Made of Rock- Piebald
6. 49 Bye-Byes- Crosby, Stills & Nash
7. Girl Inform Me- The Shins

I ain't gonna lie...it's fabulous. 

Yesterday I went to camp for Crosstrainers to ""help""...which consisted of playing with like the 2 camp kids that I knew and talking with Courtney for 28071247 hours and skipping out to Ramshackles for lunch with Courtney and Eric. Oh, and somehow I still got stuck folding a million dumb t-shirts (which I do EVERY year). Of course, Laura and I went to Grumpy's for ice cream before we left Leesburg and they had peppermint stick ice cream (which i always have to get if a place has it during a not Xmas time). It's funny. i have so many memories and emotions attached to camp. Most of them are wonderful, but some aren't so good and/or remind me of a time in my life that's not fun to remember. I've realized that camp will always be a part of me; it's formed who am i today and i like that person. My feelings toward camp will constantly be evolving; i am not stuck with a bad taste in my mouth because of any certain person. They do not, and should not, summarize camp for me. If I let them, that's my own fault. So yeah, that's incredibly freeing and exciting. 

The weather outside is beautiful, it's almost Thanksgiving (and therefore, almost Christmas), I am totally head over heels for this one boy and I get to sleep in AGAIN tomorrow...amen and alleluia."

"event","If I were to be addicted to anything, it would definitely be coffee and cigarettes. Oh wait, I'm pretty much there with the coffee; and cigarettes and I have shared a few moments...Ah well, that's neither here nor there. Sometimes I just think it would be romantic somehow to be a brooding writer with my cigarette smoke curling out my Boston apartment window while I slave over one page or another, coffee rings encircling the discarded drafts. Not that I've thought about this much, this is just what comes to me when I have to go to class so ridiculously early.

I wish there was a videocamera in the room that me and Loi share. No, not in a creepy way. Maybe just a tape recorder would do the job. We both talk in our sleep. Like when I come home and she's been asleep for like 2+ hours and so she's really passed out and mumbles things at me. I always mean to write them down so I'll remember in the morning but usually I just chuckle to myself and go to sleep. And I know I'm pretty ridiculous in the early morning hours. Like this morning for instance. When my alarm went off at 7am, I hit the snooze button and felt obligated to say ""LOI! it's 7!!!"". I mean, yes, she usually wakes up earlier than I do, but what if she has a different schedule today and wanted to sleep in? Which was definitely the case. Bahahahahaha. I hit the snooze button go off approximately 4 more times and each time the alarm rang, Loi jumped up and hit her clock. We're amazing, I know. 

I am feeling that I like this year more than I have nearly any other. It is so much of what I could have never expected or predicted or even known to hope for. And that's the best thing ever."

If you find yourself here on my side of town
I'd pray that you'd come to my door
Talk to me like you don't know what we ever fought about
Cause I don't remember anymore
I just know that she warms my heart
And knows where all my imperfections are
And she said that I was the brightest little firefly in her jar </i>

When I look back on this weekend, I realize that I haven't done very much; I've only even left the house a handful of times. Friday we did nothing but laze around the house and read and watched <i> City of God </i> and brought a blanket out back to watch the stars come out. He made me philly cheesesteaks and they were amazing. Then we went to Marble Slab and to see <i> Mirrormask </i> which was odd and wonderful and beautiful. 
Saturday was good slow and then Travis brought over a canoe and now it's in our backyard, taunting me to drop everything and take it on the lake tomorrow.
but alas, I must be semi-productive and such.

side note: Watch <i> City of God </i>. It's amazingly well done and gritty and real in the way that only truth and real life can be. 

I am so content with life right now. and i don't want to think past tomorrow. whether this is good or bad matters not. it is simply where i am."

And we are watching COPS in which a man keeps yelling ""CINDY CINDY CINDY"" and the cops put handcuffs on him to which he replies ""you better take these cuffs off me before you get arrested for false arrest"". then they decide he's on drugs and take him to jail. We never find out who Cindy is.

Can we talk about how i have alot of HW but don't even care bc there's this amazing boy that is so good to me and pretty much can't get enough of me and I of him? 
So I might get a C this semester or at least a lot of Bs. And i don't really mind.

This weekend was Fall Retreat. Steve and Randel talked about relationships and sex and everything in between. There wasn't really anything that they talked about that was a huge revelation to me, but it was still good to hear it all and know that Travis and I are in a good place. A really good one. There's something to be said for just receiving wisdom and thinking about things before you actually have to face them.

I have been wearing the same pair of ripped jeans for like 2 weeks now. It's great because you can never tell if they're dirty. I don't really wear them like every day...but pretty much.

There will be record lows tonight. They're saying 40s. dang dang DANG son. I love that.
Soon it will be cuddle up movie time forget about everything and know only the place and time of now before too much is here and you can't sprawl on the couch with sweet tea and laughter.

He writes about me like I've always wanted to be written about. He says what I never knew   to expect. We sat on the porch in the rain with icicle lights and talked about the lion that roars in the forest. He says that there could be more than one lion and I said no, there's one and we only know it when we hear it. Love in metaphors is easier than being looked at intensely. We ask big questions and want big answers but really all i want is to tell him things that I think will make me seem intriguing. But somehow he already does and so we eat Mexian food and laugh about our voices. 

He says he knew I liked him because I ate his leftovers."

"event","Writing a paper about environmental racism is making me too angry. I think I just like to get all up-in-arms about things. Not to discredit the things I'm passionate about; I'm just easily instigated. For example, Miami-Dade County has 4 times as many Superfund sites than in the rest of Florida combined. Coincidence that it also has the highest population of migrant workers? You tell me.

It seems like there are so many injustices to even handle. How can so many people be mistreated and people not know or care or be moved to action? Is it the sheer number of issues, or the overwhelming helplessness that one feels when trying to tackle such things? Is is really apathy? Could people really not care? Please, please, don't let the world be like this. 

Life in bullet form....ready...GO:

-On Saturday I was so crafty. I recovered the windowpane with new-to-me fabrics from the Aloma rummage sale and made a jewelry hanger. Now I can actually see the top of my dresser cause it's not covered with necklaces and such.  I have so many decorating plans in the works. I totally took over the house, sorry roomies. 

-Our dog, Buckwheat (or Buckerstein, Buckquita, Buckerface, Buckisha, all are appropriate) still runs away every day. 

-I need a job, but don't really want one, as exemplified by the fact that I do little to remedy my unemployment.

-Aloma Rummage Sale=love of my week. Old dusty copy of Jane Eyre. Old men's striped polos. Assorted kitchenware. Plastic beaded 50s jewelry. T-shirts...mmm yes. 

-Status was amazing last night. I feel bad about having so many preconceptions about Status in general bc they were all so wrong. Yes, all the kids that go are way too stylish for me and so scene and emo and all the boys spend far too much time on their hair, but that doesn't mean that Jesus doesn't move there. Cause He definitely does. We've been the past 4 weeks straight and every week has been equally moving and relevant and grown me in new ways. Last night was about worship and experiencing worship using ALL our senses, not just (cheesy) worship music. dang dang dang. 

-Yes, there's a boy. Yes, he's amazing. Yes, we're dating. or official or whatever terminology is correct. All I know is that it's good and fun and normal, which is saying alot for me. yeah, so I'm pretty happy. Scratch that, i'm incredible. Travis=great. 

I'm ready for fall weather and sweaters. Oh and to not have to write this paper anymore. I'm such a procrasterstein.

Saw <i>Broken Flowers </i>last night with Travis at the Enzian. As much as I love Bill Murray and his pathetic escapades, I just felt it was lacking. Some movies end unresloved and it's ok, but this one ended annoyingly unresolved. There was nothing in the movie that made you want  to continue watching it. Like at all. Sometimes I feel like indie movies are too out of the box for their own good. Like they try too hard or somesing. Ah well, I had a  great sandwich and Travis' hummus was yummy. 

We lost our Wesley IM football game AGAIN yesterday. And of course it poured from halftime onward, so we had to go home frustrated and soaked. I have to remind myself that it's just intrmurals, but I get so dag competitive. If we could just win ONCE, our moral would be in such better shape.

I have rediscovered Siler's Bald today. They are pretty much making my morning amazing. 

Oops how I'm on campus but skipped 2 classes. I'm so studious. 

I should be working on law school apps. I have to write down all my ""academic achievements"". Is it bad that I don't have any of those in college?

No job yet, I told Briarpatch no bc the shifts were ridiculously long and early. Next step is to try University Carillon UMC cause I know they need help in the nursery.

Tonight is the first jOURney at Wesley. It's the first night of the new
arts ministry and the theme is community. It's set up so that as you go
though, the viewer actually interacts with the works and has a tangible
sense of what the artist is trying to convey. It's hard to explain, so
maybe you should just come and see. 7pm University Carillon, upstairs
(there will be signs). All you need to bring is an open mind and heart
to let Jesus speak to you in new, unique ways. <br>

So that was my plug. I have so much more to catch up on, but time is
short and we all know i can be long-winded. Another update soon kids. <br>"

Right now I want nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep for 12+ hours. I've had a pesky headache all day and it's just drained all the sap out of me. Alas, I have to go take a practice LSAT from 9-12:30 tomorrow morning. Bahhhhhhhhh. 

Haruki Murakami blows my mind. I'm almost done with <i> The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> and it's just as amazing as his other books I've read. It may be my favorite yet. If you've never read anything by him, go do so. NOW.

Katrina

""Missing the personnel is the big thing in this particular event. We need our people."" 


- Lt. Andy Thaggard, a spokesman for the Mississippi National Guard, commenting on how having so many troops in Iraq is hampering relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 


Source: The Washington Post 
 
Perhaps it isn't PC to begin with a quote like this, but let's be honest, we all know that I threw out that worry a long while ago. While the issue that this quote addresses wasn't even my radar, when I read it, I sank back and sighed. What else? How many circumstances for pain and suffering do we need to put the people of our country until we say <b> enough </b>.  While I realize that these troops could not have prevented nor weakened the storm, it comes as no surprise how circular effects of previous decisions by our government are rearing their ugly heads. But now I'm getting ahead of myself. 

The most I knew of the storm before it hit was that it was big and it was aimed at the coastal regions of Louisiana and Mississippi. We don't have cable in the house and my TV watching is spotty at best anyway, so the information that I accumulated over the early part of the week was mainly from the internet, word of mouth and the few glances of TV I would see walking through certain buildings on campus. On Tuesday I picked up the New York Times in the education building and had to sit down in order to really grasp what the headlines and graphic pictures were telling me. First it was, ""Well lucky New Orleans was spared the worst of it"" and ""It could have been so much worse"".  I rallied behind those words for comfort and reassurance that everyone was ok for the most part and chalked most of it up to media sensationalism. Then the levees went. When I heard that most of the city was flooded, that water was reaching all the way uptown, I knew it was as bad as anyone could have expected. 

I tried to call my friend Cindy who goes to Loyola in New Orleans multiple times on Monday and Tuesday. Of course, all of the circuits were  down. So Tuesday afternoon I called her mom in Tampa and was told that she was safe and had evacuated to Destin before the storm hit. That qualmed my fears, as Cindy was my only direct link to the city. Not direct selfishness, but of course, like most of us, I concerned myself with what affected me directly. I am sickened by this because I know it is the same self-centered mindset that left the 28% of New Orleans population that lives below the poverty line to literally die in their own homes and neighborhoods while the rich and well-off drove their 2 or 3 cars to safety even days before the storm hit. Yeah, why didn't they evacuate??? Last time I checked the city bus routes dont provide for fleeing a doomed city with your family and belongings. Must we really mock these people by asking why they didn't evacuate? They did the damn best they could. They went to the Superdome, as directed, where they faced more mistreatment and injustice. How is anger not the natural reaction? All they sought were human basics: safety, food, shelter. Can we really sit in our air-conditioned living rooms and scoff, ""It's their own fault. The authorities did the best they could.""  I refuse to believe that this was the best that America could do. It speaks volumes of who we value. Reinqust died Sat night, and by Sun. flags flew at half-mast. They had not flown that way days earlier for the thousands who died a painful and degrading death. They had not flown for the babies and the elderly who we failed to protect in time of crisis. But heaven forgive that a flag would not fly at half-mast outside the precious capital for a bitter old man who probably had never lived a day in his life for anyone but himself. TWO DAYS. Today begins TWO F'ING DAYS of cermemonies for the deceased judge. We can put everything on hold for that long and spend God knows how much money on ONE funeral, but somehow, SOMEHOW, we can fail to realize that thousands of people are in the New Orleans convention center when THAT'S WHERE WE TOLD THEM TO GO. Yeah, that seems logical. They'll just chill there; food? Nah. Condy needs to go shoe shopping. 

Dear W, 
When you go to disaster-stricken areas, don't talk about your good ol' days partying in the Big Easy. Nobody cares how drunk you got or even how much you enjoyed the city. The people who lived there enjoyed the city too. Hell, they enjoyed having houses and jobs and food and knowing where their families and friends were. They enjoyed thinking someone in their government cared about them, maybe even wanted to do something to help. Good job ruining that for them. Maybe if they weren't so black, so poor....
Clinton has shamed you once again. He has visited and STAYED in those areas. He has spoken with poise and empathy. He has seen the core of human suffering; and he has reacted APPROPRIATELY. 
get some class, 
Amy
oh. PS. Tell Cheney he might actually have to postpone his vacation. I hear there's some sort of national emergency. But whatev, I mean, I guess it could wait."

She was one of those teachers that you're not really sure why they like you so much but just have a special affinity for you and you can't help but feel the same way. She is crazy intelligent but since she has to teach all the boring, technical stuff, her brilliance gets stifled. Life and time has worn her down and made her bitter and it makes me sad. I can picture the woman she was when she started teaching: passionate, excited, had cherished books that she longed to share, bursting with insights. But painfully unaware. And remarkably defensive. She just shut down. It happens so often. Her sickness hit me so hard bc I can see her dying that way: just giving up. And she's so much more than that. there's so much more she needs to say."

"event","I'm currently in the computer lab at Univ of Cambridge, trying to crank out my paper for summer school. It's on modernism, Virgina Woolf, Paula Modersohn Becker and the dichotomy btwn the self and the outer world. F-ing ridiculous and yet somehow, really fun and interesting. I'm just totally not in the writing mood. Actually, I'm in the sleeping mood, as it is raining and has been all day looooong. 
I can't decide whether or not to go into London this Saturday. It's our last weekend, so part of me would really like to just tool around Cambridge and see the Fitzwilliam Museum and peek into all the little churches I always walk by and maybe go to some of the other colleges. But then there's London and it's grandness. I mean, would I be stupid to be this close to London and not even go in for a day? I have been there already, but of course, would love to go again. If I don't go, I'd probably save money. Oh man, but if I go, we'd prolly go to a play. If I stay, I could go to another Shakespeare in the Park play. Dang dang dang. 

Emily called me yesterday, right in the middle of an almost-breakdown moment. It was such a God-send. I've been having on-the-edge moments quite a lot recently. It's the strangest thing; I mean, I've travelled a lot by myself and consider myself relatively good at thriving in situations like this. I suppose it's the combination of a series of events and people that contributed the aforementioned fragile state. I'm trying to push through it, relish the time, take it all in, etc. I want so badly to be at Jesus' side, in His mind, to be at an intimate, comforting place, but I find that I can't let myself.  Is it shame or fear? or both? 
That distance combined with the lack of people that know know KNOW me and I could bare my soul to...ah it just makes me ache a bit. 

Things really are going well though. Rainy days sometimes bring out these diatribes. Oh and Virginia Woolf doesn't help either. 

Prayers if you think about it. Wisdom and love shot my way would be great. 

Of course, like always, music and books console me like no other. Thank you thank you thank you Robert Smith and James Joyce (though you still confuse me) for distracting me and fascinating me."

It was close. Debit/credit cards are dangerous things in these hands. 

I have to talk about what an amazing week I had at camp last week. Like SO amazing. I was an AF for high school and Chip ended up being able to come (a day late ha!) and taught a small group with me and David Claytor, who is the new funniest person I know (let's just say he drew a stencil of a robot cooking hot-dogs over a trash can fire which he dubbed ""Hot Bot"").  Therefore, our small group ended up being so funny and ridiculous. And somehow we managed to actually have some really great, honest conversations with them. Thanks Jesus, cause that was totally not us. 

It was so great to see all the homies on team and meet new team (who, by the way, are all AWESOME). Being an AF has so many perks like going on the guard boat whenever you want, skipping breakfast to sleep in and being able to skip the boring/hard parts of being a counselor and go to all the fun parts. Fun parts= the 80s dance/rollerskating party where Chip wore a real cute jumpsuit and I looked like I should teach jazzercise on a cruise ship. Also, we picked out some dang cute costumes for the girls for Midsummer Retreat. They got CUTE.

I got to see camp in such a new light and appreciate all the things that I think I sometimes missed while I was on team. And who doesn't love sharing a pretty Le C room with Miss Sarah Campbell? It was great that we were both having the same feelings about camp so we could sort through them together. We'll have to see what this next year brings, but I'm so glad that camp is once again an exciting choice in my mind and heart. 

Went out on Sat. night with Courtney, Chip and Jill, who was in town for the weekend. SO much fun, Dubliner, McDintons and 3:00am Steak N' Shake. Yes m'am. 

For the next 2 weeks I'm doing a ""system cleanse"". Chip and I went to the health food/vitamin store yesterday. Among other things, the creepy guy there told me I am a ""blessED person"" and advised Chip on how to get rid of back fat. We both about peed our pants. He knew what he was talking about in the herbs and vitamin department though. I'm excited bc this cleanse is a good start to any vitamin introduction and health program. We'll see how it goes. Hopefully I don't spontaneously combust from all these plant extracts. 

Pier 1 is having a fabulous sale. No, I didn't buy several unneeded pillows. But what if I did? 

July 4th festivities start Thurs night at the beach. All are welcome, though there may not be sleeping space for everyone all weekend. 'Rents may come out, but probably not till Sat. Until then, as my dad put it, ""You're 21, do what you want""....(!)

Awake around 9-10ish. Read the paper/have breakfast and talk to my parents (one of my favorite parts). Watch assorted Dawson's Creek reruns/read/walk Sophie. Chip usually calls around lunchtime. We then think about the random (1) important task we <i>have</i> to do that day. Sometimes this includes outlet malls. He picks me up and then we tool around for the rest of the day. Nights usually include Sonic and Blockbuster, which we spend at least 45 min, being mutually indecisive, until we settle on a movie that used to scare us when we were little (Watcher in the Woods, The Neverending Story, etc). 
Last night we went to Thailand (south of Gandy, yes m'am!) which was fabulous and brought the total times I've eaten pad thai in one week to a whopping 3.

This past weekend was Jen and Eddy's wedding. Talk about surreal. Eddy is wonderful and I know their marriage is pleasing to God, so that's all good and such. But c'mon, I really don't feel ready for my friends to be getting married on me. Aren't we still 12 and afraid of boys? I liked that. Speaking of that, I've officially decided to be afraid of boys for at least the next 3.5 years. Then I'll be too busy anyways. So pretty much the only way that I'm going to date/ever get married is if a boy throws pebbles at my window in the middle of the night and serenades me. Then I'll be sure he likes me and won't have to guess. Guessing=lame. 

But back to the wedding festivities. Yeah, super fun. Minus the confrontation that was about a year in the works. Good thing Amy had to open her big ol' mouth at the most inopportune time. I'm good like that. I still don't regret what I said; I know that it was the Truth, and the Truth is not always pleasing and it is often offensive. And for that Truth I am willing to have my friend(s) mad at me for a bit so that they know how important it is. Still, I need to be over-intentional to make sure all that I said was said in love. Otherwise, my words were in vain.

(Maybe this isn't a good thing, bc now I lean on my default, ""get-by"" level of performance which doesn't produce any new skills or fruit). But good grades regardless. My internship was unarguably the best part of my semester though. Steve has asked me like 4 times to come back next semester/year. Kat even told me how much more enjoyable the office environment is with me there and how I always had such great insight. What a compliment! I was so floored. I though I was just the youngin' that made smart-ass comments in staff meetings. 

Um Death Cab for Cutie was on The OC tonight, confirming my love affair with both parties.

It's a fact. I WILL go to the beach this weekend. 

Right now I'm reading <i> Anna Karenina </i> and understanding why it is indeed a classic.

Someone find me a good used bookstore right now. and take me there.

In homage to my hippie roots and to celebrate Earth Day tomorrow, i'll leave you with these:

<i>Good heavens, of what uncostly material is our earthly happiness composed... if we only knew it. What incomes have we not had from a flower, and how unfailing are the dividends of the seasons. </i>
<b>James Russell Lowell</b>

<i>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin. </i>
<b>William Shakespeare</b>

<i>Earth laughs in flowers. </i>
<b>Ralph Waldo Emerson</b>

<i>I thank you God for this most amazing day, for the leaping greenly spirits of trees, and for the blue dream of sky and for everything which is natural, which is infinite, which is yes.</i>

I feel so small and wild 
Like the ramblin' footsteps of a wanderin' child 
And I'm lonesome as a lonesome whippoorwill 
Singin these blues with a warble and a trill 
But I'm not too blue to fly 
No I'm not too blue to fly cause 

The littlest birds sing the prettiest songs... </i>"

Lately I feel like my life has been changing so quickly that I haven't even had time to grasp all the changes/write it all down/talk it through. The frightening part is that I feel like my feelings and moods are so fleeting that something I am passionately concerned about or wrapped up in one day is of little interest the next. I mean, of course there are constants. But there are also things that demand obedience, even when the emotions aren't there. Like my prayer life...and friendships. And responsibilities that I previously committed to. 
I'm just in flux.
I'm moving in 3 weeks. That's when I'll be done with my junior year of college. A week after that, the first of all of our friends is getting married. Then I'm going halfway around the world for 3 weeks. 

Totally changing my life right now: Mae, ""Destination Beautiful"" and Copeland ""In Motion""

Just finished: <i> White </i>, book 3 of Ted Dekker's Circle Trilogy. These books changed my mind on Christian fiction. 

Next up: finished Bob Dylan's <i>Chronicles</i> and Jim Wallis' <i>God's Politics</i>.

This weekend I made an Ipod cover out of some material from my blue and white striped Dickies engineer overalls and some dinosaur fabric. Then it struck me: I am a nine year old boy in a 21 year old girl's body. And I like that. 

I can't wait to decorate my new house. It's going to be amazing. I hope my roomates don't mind me totally laying decorative claim. 

The Wesley/Aloma fashion show was this weekend. I have to say, it was a great time. I discovered that, along with my knack for recreating the 80s, I am also quite talented at being Jessie Spano from Saved By the Bell and an old woman from a retirement home with a pretty amazing puff-paint sweatshirt. Afterward, it was bonfire time at the boys' house. I love that smell and the conversations that arise whilst fireside. I told the WalMart story. Chase and Lindsay, you'd be so proud.

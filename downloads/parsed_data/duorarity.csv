I then meant to find the certificate after we moved to Madison so that I could give it away, but somehow it got misplaced... but today, while packing for our move to SF, it finally turned up. I actually put it in an obvious/easy to find place, but the envelope it was in managed to get shifted and stick to the side of the container so that it was very difficult to see (I even checked that *&$!@ box a few times looking for it). Anyway, so I'm offering up this gift certificate to anyone who would like it. 

As I've already mentioned, it is for four (4) half (1/2) hour guitar lessons at Avenue N Guitars, but the catch is that it expires on 12/15/08, just a couple of months from now, so you'll need to use them soon-ish. 

This was a very nice gift from E that I'm sad I never got the chance to enjoy, but I'd really love to see someone else benefit from it. Let me know if you're interested."

"event","The e-mail below was forwarded to me by a good friend (going to her wedding next month), who received it from their good friends from Alaska. I know how suspect that sounds, but according to <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/kilkenny.asp"">Snopes.com</a>, the original e-mail message about Sarah Palin being forwarded in it is indeed real, so I'm passing it on just as I run out to hit the gym before the little girl wakes up on this busy Saturday morning:

Hi Everybody-
Last Saturday, before a wedding, Michelle and I stood next to our van (with Alaska plates) in the sunshine outside a beautiful church, waiting for the bride to arrive. Nearly all passersby stopped to ask us about Sarah Palin. Those who know I'm from Alaska ask about her within the first few seconds of conversation, which is to be expected and is a great conversation-starter. Not only am I Alaskan, but Michelle and I lived in Wasilla when Palin ran for and became mayor of the little town. When pushed about my opinion on her politics, my response has usually been a benign, ""I don't share her political views."" Well, it goes deeper than that. I'm a bit frightened by the possibility of her as president.

So lately I've been wondering (quite reluctantly) if I should take a more proactive approach. I'm glad someone with more specific knowledge than that which I possess has done so. While there are undertones of some small-town bitterness in Anne's letter, much of what she says rings true in my opinion and experience as a resident of Wasilla. The letter seems to have been spoken from the heart as much as possible. At the very least, Anne raises issues which should be seriously considered. I hope the firestorm this letter is creating will be investigated more fully so the ""small-town bitterness"" argument is put to rest.

Forgive me for cluttering your inbox, but it seems that this is important information. Hope you are all having a wonderful fall! Hope to see you soon.

cheers,
Jon

A note to all by Anne Kilkenny

Dear friends,

So many people have asked me about what I know about Sarah Palin in the last 2 days that I decided to write something up . . .

Basically, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton have only 2 things in common: their gender and their good looks. :)

You have my permission to forward this to your friends/email contacts with my name and email address
attached, but please do not post it on any websites, as there are too many kooks out there . .

[This was already posted on Washington Independent comments area, with a controllable hotmail account, and
was obviously meant by the author to be read.]

Thanks,
Anne

==========

ABOUT SARAH PALIN

I am a resident of Wasilla, Alaska. I have known Sarah since 1992. Everyone here knows Sarah, so it is nothing
special to say we are on a first-name basis. Our children have attended the same schools. Her father was
my child's favorite substitute teacher. I also am on a first name basis with her parents and mother-in-law. I
attended more City Council meetings during her administration than about 99% of the residents of the
city.

She is enormously popular; in every way she's like the most popular girl in middle school. Even men who think
she is a poor choice and won't vote for her can't quit smiling when talking about her because she is a ""babe"".

It is astonishing and almost scary how well she can keep a secret. She kept her most recent pregnancy a
secret from her children and parents for seven months.

She is ""pro-life"". She recently gave birth to a Down's syndrome baby. There is no cover-up involved, here;
Trig is her baby.

She is energetic and hardworking. She regularly worked out at the gym.

She is savvy. She doesn't take positions; she just ""puts things out there"" and if they prove to be
popular, then she takes credit.

Her husband works a union job on the North Slope for BP and is a champion snowmobile racer. Todd Palin's kind
of job is highly sought-after because of the schedule and high pay. He arranges his work schedule so he can
fish for salmon in Bristol Bay for a month or so in summer, but by no stretch of the imagination is fishing
their major source of income. Nor has her life-style ever been anything like that of native Alaskans.

Sarah and her whole family are avid hunters.

She's smart.

Her experience is as mayor of a city with a population of about 5,000 (at the time), and less than 2 years as
governor of a state with about 670,000 residents.

During her mayoral administration most of the actual work of running this small city was turned over to an
administrator. She had been pushed to hire this administrator by party power-brokers after she had
gotten herself into some trouble over precipitous firings which had given rise to a recall campaign.

Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a ""fiscal conservative"". During her 6 years as Mayor, she increased general
government expenditures by over 33%. During those same 6 years the amount of taxes collected by the City
increased by 38%. This was during a period of low inflation (1996-2002). She reduced progressive property
taxes and increased a regressive sales tax which taxed even food. The tax cuts that she promoted benefited
large corporate property owners way more than they benefited residents.

The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration weren't enough to fund everything on her
wish list though, borrowed money was needed, too. She inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with
indebtedness of over $22 million. What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for? Was it the
infrastructure that she said she supported? The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked? or a new library?
No. $1m for a park. $15m-plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex which she rushed through to
build on a piece of property that the City didn't even have clear title to, that was still in litigation 7 yrs
later--to the delight of the lawyers involved! The sports complex itself is a nice addition to the
community but a huge money pit, not the profit-generator she claimed it would be. She also supported
bonds for $5.5m for road projects that could have been done in 5-7 yrs without any borrowing.

While Mayor, City Hall was extensively remodeled and her office redecorated more than once.

These are small numbers, but Wasilla is a very small city.

As an oil producer, the high price of oil has created a budget surplus in Alaska. Rather than invest this
surplus in technology that will make us energy independent and increase efficiency, as Governor she
proposed distribution of this surplus to every individual in the state.

In this time of record state revenues and budget surpluses, she recommended that the state borrow/bond
for road projects, even while she proposed distribution of surplus state revenues: spend today's surplus,
borrow for needs.

She's not very tolerant of divergent opinions or open to outside ideas or compromise. As Mayor, she fought
ideas that weren't generated by her or her staff. Ideas weren't evaluated on their merits, but on the basis of
who proposed them.

While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian
refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed. City residents rallied
to the defense of the City Librarian and against Palin's attempt at out-and-out censorship, so Palin
backed down and withdrew her termination letter. People who fought her attempt to oust the Librarian are on her
enemies list to this day.

Sarah complained about the ""old boy's club"" when she first ran for Mayor, so what did she bring Wasilla? A
new set of ""old boys"". Palin fired most of the experienced staff she inherited. At the City and as
Governor she hired or elevated new, inexperienced, obscure people, creating a staff totally dependent on
her for their jobs and eternally grateful and fiercely loyal--loyal to the point of abusing their power to
further her personal agenda, as she has acknowledged happened in the case of pressuring the State's top cop
(see below).

As Mayor, Sarah fired Wasilla's Police Chief because he ""intimidated"" her, she told the press. As Governor, her
recent firing of Alaska's top cop has the ring of familiarity about it. He served at her pleasure and she
had every legal right to fire him, but it's pretty clear that an important factor in her decision to fire
him was because he wouldn't fire her sister's ex-husband, a State Trooper. Under investigation for abuse
of power, she has had to admit that more than 2 dozen contacts were made between her staff and family to the
person that she later fired, pressuring him to fire her ex-brother-in- law. She tried to replace the man she
fired with a man who she knew had been reprimanded for sexual harassment; when this caused a public furor, she
withdrew her support.

She has bitten the hand of every person who extended theirs to her in help. The City Council person who
personally escorted her around town introducing her to voters when she first ran for Wasilla City Council
became one of her first targets when she was later elected Mayor. She abruptly fired her loyal City
Administrator; even people who didn't like the guy were stunned by this ruthlessness.

Fear of retribution has kept all of these people from saying anything publicly about her.

When then-Governor Murkowski was handing out political plums, Sarah got the best, Chair of the Alaska Oil and
Gas Conservation Commission: one of the few jobs not in Juneau and one of the best paid. She had no background
in oil & gas issues. Within months of scoring this great job which paid $122,400/yr, she was complaining
in the press about the high salary. I was told that she hated that job: the commute, the structured hours, the
work. Sarah became aware that a member of this Commission (who was also the State Chair of the
Republican Party) engaged in unethical behavior on the job. In a gutsy move which some undoubtedly cautioned
her could be political suicide, Sarah solved all her problems in one fell swoop: got out of the job she
hated and garnered gobs of media attention as the patron saint of ethics and as a gutsy fighter against
the ""old boys' club"" when she dramatically quit, exposing this man's ethics violations (for which he was
fined).

As Mayor, she had her hand stuck out as far as anyone for pork from Senator Ted Stevens. Lately, she has
castigated his pork-barrel politics and publicly humiliated him. She only opposed the ""bridge to
nowhere"" after it became clear that it would be unwise not to.

As Governor, she gave the Legislature no direction and budget guidelines, then made a big grandstand display
of line-item vetoing projects, calling them pork. Public outcry and further legislative action restored
most of these projects--which had been vetoed simply because she was not aware of their importance-- but
with the unobservant she had gained a reputation as ""anti-pork"".

She is solidly Republican: no political maverick. The State party leaders hate her because she has bit them
in the back and humiliated them. Other members of the party object to her self-description as a fiscal
conservative.

Around Wasilla there are people who went to high school with Sarah. They call her ""Sarah Barracuda"" because of
her unbridled ambition and predatory ruthlessness. Before she became so powerful, very ugly stories
circulated around town about shenanigans she pulled to be made point guard on the high school basketball team.
When Sarah's mother-in-law, a highly respected member of the community and experienced manager, ran for
Mayor, Sarah refused to endorse her.

As Governor, she stepped outside of the box and put together of package of legislation known as ""AGIA"" that
forced the oil companies to march to the beat of her drum.

Like most Alaskans, she favors drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. She has questioned if the
loss of sea ice is linked to global warming. She campaigned ""as a private citizen"" against a state
initiative that would have either a) protected salmon streams from pollution from mines, or b) tied up in the
courts all mining in the state (depending on who you listen to). She has pushed the State's lawsuit against
the Dept. of the Interior's decision to list polar bears as threatened species.

McCain is the oldest person to ever run for President; Sarah will be a heartbeat away from being President.

There has to be literally millions of Americans who are more knowledgeable and experienced than she.

However, there's a lot of people who have underestimated her and are regretting it.

CLAIM VS FACT

*""Hockey mom"": true for a few years

*""PTA mom"": true years ago when her first-born was in
elementary school, not since

*""NRA supporter"": absolutely true

*social conservative: mixed. Opposes gay marriage, BUT
vetoed a bill that would have denied benefits to
employees in same-sex relationships (said she did this
because it was unconstitutional) .

*pro-creationism: mixed. Supports it, BUT did nothing as Governor to promote it.

*""Pro-life"": mixed. Knowingly gave birth to a Down's syndrome baby BUT declined to call a special
legislative session on some pro-life legislation

*""Experienced"": Some high schools have more students than Wasilla has residents. Many cities have more
residents than the state of Alaska. No legislative experience other than City Council. Little hands-on
supervisory or managerial experience; needed help of a city administrator to run town of about 5,000.

*political maverick: not at all

*gutsy: absolutely!

*open & transparent: ??? Good at keeping secrets. Not good at explaining actions.

*has a developed philosophy of public policy: no

*""a Greenie"": no. Turned Wasilla into a wasteland of big box stores and disconnected parking lots. Is pro-
drilling off-shore and in ANWR.

*fiscal conservative: not by my definition!

*pro-infrastructure: No. Promoted a sports complex and park in a city without a sewage treatment plant or
storm drainage system. Built streets to early 20th century standards.

*pro-tax relief: Lowered taxes for businesses, increased tax burden on residents

*pro-small government: No. Oversaw greatest expansion of city government in Wasilla's history.

*pro-labor/pro- union. No. Just because her husband works union doesn't make her pro-labor. I have seen
nothing to support any claim that she is pro-labor/pro-union.

WHY AM I WRITING THIS?

First, I have long believed in the importance of being an informed voter. I am a voter registrar. For 10 years
I put on student voting programs in the schools. If you google my name (Anne Kilkenny + Alaska), you will find
references to my participation in local government, education, and PTA/parent organizations.

Secondly, I've always operated in the belief that ""Bad things happen when good people stay silent"". Few people
know as much as I do because few have gone to as many City Council meetings.

Third, I am just a housewife. I don't have a job she can bump me out of. I don't belong to any organization
that she can hurt. But, I am no fool; she is immensely popular here, and it is likely that this will cost me
somehow in the future: that's life.

Fourth, she has hated me since back in 1996, when I was one of the 100 or so people who rallied to support the
City Librarian against Sarah's attempt at censorship.

Fifth, I looked around and realized that everybody else was afraid to say anything because they were somehow
vulnerable.

CAVEATS

I am not a statistician. I developed the numbers for the increase in spending & taxation 2 years ago (when
Palin was running for Governor) from information supplied to me by the Finance Director of the City of
Wasilla, and I can't recall exactly what I adjusted for: did I adjust for inflation? for population
increases? Right now, it is impossible for a private person to get any info out of City Hall--they are
swamped. So I can't verify my numbers.

You may have noticed that there are various numbers circulating for the population of Wasilla, ranging from
my ""about 5,000"", up to 9,000. The day Palin's selection was announced a city official told me that
the current population is about 7,000. The official 2000 census count was 5,460. I have used about 5,000
because Palin was Mayor from 1996 to 2002, and the city was growing rapidly in the mid-90's.

"event","We miss Chicago. Madison is a nice town, but I'm afraid that it's just too small for us. Combine that with not really having any friends here, weather that has routinely denied us from being outside on most weekends (although the last couple have been mostly okay) and the fact that we can't really settle in because we know we are relocating to SF in the not-too-distant-future, and you have one mildly unhappy and often very bored couple. 

That said, we are going to Disney World for a week's vacation in a couple of months. We bought our tickets and made reservations this past weekend. While we're there, we are going to take at least one day to see some of her family and another to visit the parks with friends, but mostly we will spend the time together just relaxing and enjoying ourselves. We tend to take vacations that have always included seeing family and friends, which are great actually, but this time we wanted to make sure we had plenty of time where there was no outside pressure on us to do anything. You know, like a real vacation where you get away from it all.

She is going to be visiting home early next month for a wedding. He decided not to come this time, mostly because it would have been a very busy (aka: stressful) and extra expensive weekend if we bought tickets for both of us to go (since we were not able to find frequent flier seats). So just she is going and he is going to be left alone in exciting Madison for the holiday weekend :(

However, not long after that trip, he will be in San Francisco for a week on business, but with time free on the weekends to see the family, especially his ailing grandparents. The company will be putting him up in a very nice hotel on Union Square, so we used some frequent flier miles to get a ticket for her to come for one of the weekends and enjoy the city with him. This time around, we're hoping to see more of the local ""scene"" (maybe going to a club on Friday night). Maybe we'll also get a chance to explore a bit more of the Bay Area to help us decide where we want to live when we move there. Should be fun!

So that's the rough update. Going to try to post more often on here moving forward, but no promises ;)"

However, your favorite duo will be returning Friday night to our beloved Windy City.  We know you've all missed us dearly and will be more than happy to help us move our shite Saturday around noon.  Pizza and beer will be provided.  

Who's in to help us?  Seriously we will love you forever.

"event","After yesterday's awesome purchase of all seven seasons of Buffy for $35, I thought I'd stop by and check on how all the other moving sale DVD stuff was selling, and since nobody had decided to buy the first three seasons of Alias yet, I grabbed those this morning for $15 (I've heard it's good, and I figured for that cheap, why not). The big question though is whether or not I bother to get the first (and only?) four seasons of the Buffy spin off show Angel? Any thoughts on that show? Is it even worth the $20? After we've watched Buffy, are we going to regret not having bought this show, or is it better to just let the world of Buffy go when the series is over?"

"event","So at some point in the last couple of weeks, Outlook stopped being able to send e-mail . Receiving mail worked fine, but try to send a message and it would fail to reach my e-mail server. I decided to look into it (in the meantime, web-mail still worked for sending messages, so clearly not everything was broken). I contacted the ISP that hosts my domain name and where I have my main e-mail accounts and they had me run a few tests where we determined that port 25, the port used by their SMTP server for outgoing mail, is being blocked by Comcast, my local ISP. WTF?!? I tried using their alternate ports and those are blocked by Comcast as well. So now I have to contact Comcast and see if they will unblock those ports for me so that I can once again send outgoing e-mail through my ""real"" e-mail accounts. I hate shit like this! Yes, I'm sure that infected computers are a problem on their cable modem system, but instead of figuring out who is actually sending out spam on their system, they instead implement a blanket solution and block everyone from using standard outgoing SMTP e-mail ports. If they don't unblock those ports for me, I'm going to be one extremely unsatisfied customer."

At the moment my mood is swinging back and forth between exhaustion and something akin to a 23rd wind (high energy spurts for a few minutes here and there, probably thanks to the free Redbull I drank all night). I keep getting random ideas/thoughts like:

""Hey, I should totally go to the gym!!!""

followed by:

""If you even manage to find the place in your current state, you will hurt yourself horribly if you go anywhere near weights right now.""

followed by stuff like:

""Hey, since I should just stay up until my normal bedtime tonight, I should invite everyone over for like a huge party or something!!!""

followed by something along the lines of:

""Dude, if you really want to throw a party, you can, but you'll have to take care of it all because I have to go to bed soon""

at which point I can't help but wonder who the hell I am talking to... :P

"event","She has been looking for a job going back to pretty much before she even moved here, but nothing great was turning up, and frankly there was no rush or need for her to get one, although I know that by the time a month had rolled around she was getting antsy to get one anyway. So, in a sense, she settled and interviewed with an educational organization she wasn't really all that interested in, but which paid fairly well and was probably the very stable/smart thing to do... but after her second very successful interview, she called me and basically expressed how she was so completely NOT interested in the job (which they offered her btw), at least not at heart or in the ways you ""should"" be interested in a job; while she could totally do it, and probably do it  very well, it was not at all a challenge, not at all a thrill, and not anything along the lines of what she really wanted to do or have become a career. So I told her that it was fine with me if she didn't accept the job, but that she should go home and start applying for more jobs that she did actually want. And guess what she did?

My baby frack'ing (BSG reference) came home and started cold calling companies in the field she wanted to work in! That's right, she was so driven that she found a long list of places she wanted to work at, contacted a good portion of them inquiring about jobs, and was actually turned away by almost all of them, but then finally came across one where they were looking for someone with a lot of potential and aptitude (and her experience and well written resume also helped I'm sure), but who, at the same time, was also willing to start at the bottom, work their way up quickly and basically prove themselves... After talking to them on the phone for almost an hour, they scheduled her to come in the next day for an interview, which she aced becuase they offered to start her the very next day!

So basically she found the dream job that she wanted, and not one that just fell into her lap either; she made it frack'ing (BSG again... yeah, I'm a huge dork...) happen on her own, and now, to reach her current goals, she just has to earn what it takes to get to the next level at it! I personally have no doubt she will do just that... and more. 

She is truly amazing. I am extremely proud of my baby.

"event","ON Tuesday at work the drain from the roof which passes through the wall partially failed and we had about two inches of water flood several offices, so we scrambled around for an hour or so moving critical equipment out of them and making sure the power was turned off in those areas. But much worse off was our building next door where some of the other teams reside which had the toilets going in reverse and flood half the building with <b>raw sewage</b>. A look outside explained why this was all happening, as there was literally a geyser of water shooting out of the man holes in the street (seriously) and the Deep Tunnel (which runs directly under our building) vents in our parking lot were shooting water up twenty or so feet in the air like Old Faithful. It was crazy! Later, after the rain had stopped, I walked over to the river and it was up well over eight inches from where it had been earlier. That was the second biggest rains storm I've ever seen, the biggest being one in Brazil that felt about that intense but that went on for two days and flooded the streets a couple of feet high. I'm really glad that my own place didn't suffer any flooding downstairs.

So yesterday we had several industrial fans and dehumidifiers running all day in our office area (the dehumidifiers soo reminded me of Dune as the literally sucked the moister out of the air and filled large plastic garbage cans with water, many feet of water I might add) while the building next door had the carpets and the first eight inches or so of all the walls and insulation removed because it all literally reeked of shit. I'll take roof water over that any day! 

Luckily the rain storm that hit yesterday was much less intense than the previous and we didn't experience any further flooding."

"event","The latest news on one of my favorite shows:

""Meanwhile it's official. Executive producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick issued a joint statement confirming that ""Battlestar Galactica"" will end after the upcoming fourth season. 

The pair reiterate that it was their decision to close the series, and hinted that it was a struggle just to get the renewal for this final season.

A two-hour episode will air in November, followed by the 22-episode fourth season to screen starting in January on the Sci-Fi Channel.""

That sucks that it will come to an end next year, but the up side is that at least they know it is ending and can actually wrap things up properly. So many shows I've liked never had a chance to do that, so in a sense that's good news."

It turns out that Saturday night some vanilla friends are doing a b-day thing in Wicker Park that will probably leave us too full of drink to hit GD, and Sunday evening, weather permitting, is a BBQ with some other vanilla friends or maybe dinner with some very cool people from Milwaukee. So is anyone else planning to be at GD on Friday?

I so can't wait to see her."

Boooo!

We've officially decided to work this Saturday, but at least we are making it a normal eight hour day instead of the twelve hour ones we're doing during the week. I'm thinking that I'll probably go out and grab a beer with office mates that night then.

I hate the weather here sometimes. As I walked out of my front door this morning to go to the gym there were these white puffy things drifting around in the air. I thought they might be pollen, but nope, they were snow flakes. Winter just won't seem to quit!"

"event","I haven't seen the data cables for either my digital camera or my MP3 player since I flew back from the Canary Islands two weeks ago :(. I've looked all over for them multiple times, but I've finally accepted that they are gone. I suppose they are in some airline's lost and found or still on that topless beach in Tenerife. Now the MP3 player is relatively new, so I'm looking into getting a replacement, but the camera was so very very old, and I've actually been waiting... no, hoping for it to break so I could get a shiny new toy to replace it. I think no longer being able to actually get the pictures off the camera counts as being broken don't you? :P"

"event","Okay, this weekend was a blast. Drinks with friends/coworkers on Friday night after a long day (we  went straight to the bar and got there at 11PM) and even longer week, then I meet up with a girl I've been talking to for awhile for lunch on Saturday, and although we didn't have the right kind of chemistry with each other, it was still interesting talking with her; she gave me some insight into this whole other group in the local scene from b.com. Anyway, so later I went to meet up with <lj user=""sweetainsley""> and <lj user=""introdom""> at the SEDs meeting where a panel discussed kinky conventions around the globe, the in-and-outs of them both good and bad, and by the end I was really excited about SINSations in two weeks, excited enough that I decided to get a room at the show rather than commute back and forth from Chicago. I really didn't expect the SEDS meeting to be so interesting, but poeple had a lot of very useful information and insights, so I'm glad I went. After the meeting ended, <lj user=""sweetainsley"">, <lj user=""introdom""> and I headed back to my place to drop off their stuff (they stayed the night) and we headed out in search of food.

Given that it was a Saturday night, a lot of the good restuarants in the area were packed already, so we ended up eating at an Asian place I'd never tried. I generally avoid Asian places, or in other words places that mix up cuisines like having Chinese AND Japanese dishes on the same menu, but this one actually turned out to be pretty good, at least for the price, which was very reasonable. After we finished eating, we were off to the party they had come into town for.

Okay, so I knew pretty much everyone at the party was going to be kinky, but for some reason I didn't put two and two together, so I was actually surprised when I walked in and saw that people were dressed up and playing. But of course I was immediately like ""Yay, people playing!"" and settled in to enjoying the fun. I really enjoyed it and I'm totally glad I got to see the ""machine"" at work on four different people.

We didn't get back to my place until after 4 AM and then my body clock woke me up around the usual time, so I was pretty wiped on Sunday. Hitting the gym hard only made it worse, but I still managed to get some errands run and do taxes. Then <lj user=""introdom""> and I watched part of Casino Royale, which was actually suprisingly good, that is for a Bond movie. Much darker than any they've done before and I found myself really liking the character.

Anyway, so I tried several times on Sunday to get in touch with the hotel where SINSations is happening because I wanted to get a room, but had no luck. Finally today though I got through and made my reservation, so I won't have to leave the convention the whole weekend. AND I was able to get my company to let me take that Friday off so I'll get to be there from start to finish. I'm fucking stoked!"

"event","Listening to a blog entry about fortune cookies on LJ a minute ago, I found myself remembering one of my own... Back in the 90's, right as I was about to embark on a year long series of raves, I got a fortune that simply said ""You will go to many parties"". 

I took it not so much as a prediction but as an order that was absolutely imperative to follow. I'll post a picture to prove it at some point when I'm not at work on a Saturday."

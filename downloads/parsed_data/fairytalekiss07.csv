"event","&nbsp;It's been a long time since I last blogged, which kind of already says that I was busy with so many things. I felt like I was holding my breath the whole year for the college entrance exam results. I just am glad that I passed my dream school, Ateneo :D <br /><br />I can finally breathe. <br /><br />At last, hard work has finally paid off :)<br /><br />I'll write my whole story about the college entrance exams whirlwind when I get some free time. Right now I'm in the middle of writing a paper about <em>Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo</em>.&nbsp;"

"event","Yesterday, I felt like the most horrible person in the planet. For the past 5 years I've been almost too sure that things would turn out how I wanted them to. I did not care about the dirty little mischief trying to creep itself in every now and then, nor did I care to take a second glance at the pile of dirt that<em> we've</em> mastered to keep hidden. I did not care because I was just too sure.<br /><br /><em>We</em> always thought that we were perfect the way we were, and if we just kept on finding something to cover up the hole, we would be able to keep going forward. Maybe it's because<em> </em>we were in denial, or maybe because this was the only thing we knew how to do. <br /><br /><em>We </em>smiled without knowing the truth, we laughed thinking everything was perfect. Oh, only a fool can over-look that. <br /><br />It could be pride and a whole lot of insensitivity that kept my eyes closed in this track. I've held captive of a belief that we all started from the same point in the race, so there is not a justifiable reason to stop and wait for the other. I always thought that it worked that way, and for once, my belief has failed me. <br /><br />I can see the puppet master laughing right now. Softly and discretely I wish I could talk to him and ask him for just one favor.

"event","I woke up just as I would wake up on a normal school day. Things were going... well, smooth, i guess. I didn't wake up late, my breakfast arrived on time, and my bag was all ready. First days usually give me the most anxiety - new people, new surroundings, and a lot to get used to all over again. Despite the timidness, I managed to eat my breakfast, walk in the shower, and put on my clothes. I looked at myself in the mirror and that's when I said <em>Wow, I can't believe I'm a senior. </em>It's quite funny how I used to pity the seniors a lot. I&nbsp;have this huge fear of growing up, and it hasn't disappeared until now. Sometimes I'd wish that everything is just a dream, I'd hope to scratch my eyes and wake up 4 years ago. To add to my sentimentality, the teachers still had to say that this year will be the fastest year we'll ever have. If I could, I would have stood up and said, <em>Please take it back</em>, but I couldn't. They were right and I just had to swallow it. <br />"

My family sat down to help me choose. We started with the ones under Diliman, since it's the obvious first choice. I placed several asterisks beside the courses I could possibly take then I had to pick my first and second choice...<br /><br />Scenario 1:<br /><br />Guia: Mom, I graduated grade school 2007 right?<br />Mom: Didn't you graduate 2006?<br />Guia: No, I'm sure it was 2007! See, 3rd year ended 2009, 2nd year - 2008, 1st year - 2007, soo grade 7 - *uhhh* ooooops!<br />Mom: Okay, slash off the math courses!<br /><br />Scenario 2: <br /><br />Guia: Mom, I think I really want Psychology already<br />Mom: Okay, go ahead!<br />Guia: Wait, how do you spell <em>Psychology</em>?<br />Mom: Slash off the English courses :|<br /><br />Scenario 3:<br /><br />Brother: Guia do you like Science?<br />Guia: hell no<br />Brother: Then stop choosing Science courses!<br />Guia:&nbsp;oh. <br /><br />Scenario 4:<br /><br />Guia: HMMM Broadcast Comm, sounds really interesting!<br />Mom: Yeah, that's a pretty good course. I think that's Gabby's second choice.<br />Guia: What do they do? What do they become?<br />Mom: Well, you know... Korina Sanchez, etc. etc.<br />Guia: Oh, nevermind. But it's cool though. <br /><br />Scenario 5:<br /><br />Guia: Okaaay, tourism! Traveling!<br />Brother: You sure?<br />Guia: Why? What do they do?<br />Brother: Become a tour guide?<br />*both look at our mom with big question marks*<br /><br />Scenario 6:<br /><br />Guia: BA or BS?<br />Brother: Definitely BA<br />Guia: I think I want BS<br />Brother: You sure?<br />Guia: Why not?<br />Brother: Take BA<br />Guia: No I&nbsp;want BS!<br />Brother:&nbsp;Fine. Take BS<br />Guia: No, okay, I think I want BA.<br /><br />There's a lot more but it would be too long and tiring. Haha!&nbsp;Story of my life.

Between the thin sheets I lie.
Between the thin sheets you lie.
That's what we have in common.
You speak with your mouth closed,
I hear with my ears shut,
Yet between the thin sheets we lie.
You stood at the end.
I walked to the end,
Knowing words we spoke of won't deny.
Now, we are still lying,
Both with grayed hair.
There was never really nothing except what we had in common -
Between the thin sheets we lie.

 In case you still don't get it, it's about a husband and a wife living a monotonous marriage. No love, just marriage."

"event","Stolen from Tiff. Usually I ignore these kinds of stuff but I&nbsp;can't seem to disregard this one.&nbsp;Here it goes:<br /><br />She&rsquo;s the one you call when you&rsquo;re bored because she makes you laugh. She&rsquo;s the one you talk to when you&rsquo;re feeling down because she&rsquo;s willing to lend an ear and be a friend.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s not the one you call when you need a date to your company&rsquo;s Christmas party, or to go dancing with on a Saturday night. She&rsquo;s the one you spend time with between girlfriends, before you find &quot;The One.&quot;<br /><br />You know, the one who you keep around in the meantime.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s not one of the guys, not a tomboy, but you don&rsquo;t look at her as a &quot;real&quot; woman, either.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s not bitchy enough, moody enough, or sexy enough to be seen in that light.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s too laid-back, too easily amused by the same things your male buddies are amused by.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s too understanding, too comfortable &ndash; she doesn&rsquo;t make you feel nervous or excited the way a &quot;real&quot; woman does. But she&rsquo;s cool, and nice, and funny, and attractive enough that when you&rsquo;re lonely, she&rsquo;ll do just fine.<br /><br />You don&rsquo;t have to wine and dine her because she knows the real you already, and you don&rsquo;t have any facades to keep up, no pretenses to preserve. You&rsquo;re not trying to get anything of substance out of her.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s not easy, but you know that she cares about you and is attracted to you, and that she&rsquo;ll give you the intimacy you need. And you know you don&rsquo;t have to explain yourself or the situation, that she&rsquo;ll be able to cope with the fact that this isn&rsquo;t the beginning of a relationship or that there&rsquo;s any possibility that you have any real romantic feelings for her.<br /><br />It won&rsquo;t bother her that you&rsquo;ll get up in the morning, put on your pants, say goodbye, and go on a date with the woman you&rsquo;ve been mooning over for weeks who finally agreed to go out with you. She&rsquo;ll settle for a goodbye hug and a promise to call her and tell her how the date went.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s just so cool... why can&rsquo;t all women be like that?!<br /><br />But deep down, if you really think about it (which you probably don&rsquo;t because to you, the situation between the two of you isn&rsquo;t important enough to merit any real thought), you know that it&rsquo;s really not fair. You know that although she would never say it, it hurts her to know that despite all her good points and all the fun you two have, you don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s good enough to spend any real time with.<br /><br />Sure, it&rsquo;s mostly her fault, because she doesn&rsquo;t have to give in to your needs &ndash; she could play the hard-to-get bitch like the rest of them do, if she really wanted to. But you and she both know that she probably couldn&rsquo;t pull it off.<br /><br />Maybe she&rsquo;s too short, or a little overweight, or has a big birthmark on her forehead. Whatever the reason, somehow life has given her a lot of really great qualities but has left out the ones that men want (or think they want) in a woman. So she remains forever the funny friend, the steadfast companion, the secret lover, and you go on searching for your goddess who will somehow be everything you ever wanted in a woman.<br /><br />You&rsquo;ll joke to her that she should be the best man at your wedding, and she&rsquo;ll laugh and make a joke about a smelly rental tux. She doesn&rsquo;t captivate you with her beauty, or open doors with her smile. Mainly she blends in with the crowd. She&rsquo;s safe. She doesn&rsquo;t want to be the center of attention and turn the heads of everyone in the room. But she wants to turn someone&rsquo;s head. She wants to be special to someone, too. We all do.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />She has feelings. She has a heart. In fact, she probably has a bigger and better heart than any woman you&rsquo;ve ever known because <strong>she&rsquo;s had a front-row seat to The Mess That Is Your Life, and she loves you anyway.</strong> She obviously sees something worthwhile and redeeming in you because although you&rsquo;ve given her nothing, absolutely no reason to still be around, she is. Anyway, yeah, I once was a Meantime Girl. Been one more times than I care to admit. I don&rsquo;t know the reason, really, and at this point I don&rsquo;t even care. I just want to let every guy know who&rsquo;s ever had the good fortune to have a Meantime Girl that we may be a lot of fun, but we cry, too. A lot.<br /><br /><br />"

Philosopy: &quot;It is what it is not and it is not what it is. It can only be defined negatively, which is also the only positive definition of it.&quot;
&nbsp;It appears as though everything that I have studied for didn't really come out in the test. 15+ names is it? 50+ words is it? Over a&nbsp;&nbsp; hundred phrases?&nbsp;

English: I wish I studied more, but I don't really regret dedicating the whole afternoon for Physics :D I&nbsp;can't believe I wrote a whole script for Les Miserables and not remember the name of the author :|&nbsp;

I&nbsp;can't understand why so many people think that it was boring or something of that sort. For the first time, I participated in so much activities.<br /><br /><strong>Day 1</strong><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fairytalekiss07/pic/00001t2y/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fairytalekiss07/pic/00001t2y/s320x240"" /><br />Nats.Den.Me.Karen (Our Marshall)<br type=""_moz"" /></a></div>The Zobel Raze! It was like a mini Amazing Race but only in the school area. It was 9:20 when we arrived at the first location. We were anxiously waiting for Cha and the rest of the crew. At 10:15 the race started, with our first mission to go find Gerard at the CPA balcony. The sprint from the vougerard to the CPA was beyond my capacity. I felt like I was gonna faint, and that's when I realized how unhealthy I am. I never do these sort of things - I don't run for fun nor do I exercise on a daily basis. Yeah, I was sure I was unhealthy at that moment. I had to keep going though because I&nbsp;didn't wanna fail the team. We were asked to run up and down the main building and back to the CPA finding and solving for the next clue.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were caught up in the 6th task, which was &quot;Wordoku&quot;. I've managed to solve a Sodoku before but I was completely held off guard with that puzzle. We were doing just fine until we only had one more box to fill up. That's when we realized that we were wrong. We didn't know what to do so we erased everything and started from scratch. There were two teams left, us and a team from our batch. 6th to be eliminated, not bad at all. Our marshall even said that she didn't reach that far when she joined before. We took out the Wordoku paper, sat outside the building, and finished it. It was the most satisfying thing in the world. We later learned that none of our batch mates placed, which was kind of frustrating but it was okay considering we were up against the seniors, who are also btw athletes. So technically, there was no match. It was all cool. The rest of the day we just watched others participate in their own activities like the WOW Bulaga, 5 Minutes of Fame, Are You Smarter than A 5th Grader, and lastly, The Battle of the Bands. All in all, it was an amazing day.<br /><strong><br />Day 2<div style=""text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fairytalekiss07/pic/00002yk5/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fairytalekiss07/pic/00002yk5/s320x240"" /></a></div></strong>I spent the whole day with my barkada's booth. POSE&nbsp;is the most hilarious booth ever. If they choose not to bail, they'd have to pick a random pose from the POSE box and pose for 5 minutes without moving. If they move, they'd have to start all over again. When they ask what booth we are, we say it in the scariest way possible to make them bail. Alphonse &amp; I were actually talking about this whole catching &amp; bailing thing. We both agreed that it's a form of Extortion but wth, it's fun. And what would the zobel fair be without booths, right? The highlights of the day were the most awaited STOMP and COMMUNITY CONCERT. Our batch mates did great during Stomp! We didn't win but they were awesome. On the other hand, the Community Concert was uuuh-mazing!<strong>&nbsp;</strong>At least, aside from the terrifying tasks our teachers make us do, we finally got to see a different side to them.<br /><strong><br />Day 3<br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fairytalekiss07/pic/00003fqg/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/fairytalekiss07/pic/00003fqg"" /></a></div></strong>We've been cheated, been mistreated, when will we be loved?<br />This time! :) Batch 2010 got to take home the 2nd place for the cheer dance competition. I have to say, I didn't expect it, but they were so amazing! I'm so proud that their hard work finally paid off. Congrats Juniors! I love you!&nbsp;:)"

Everybody Knows - Dixie Chicks

Tell me now if you came sneaking up behind
Would you know me and see behind the smile?
I can change like colors on a wall
Hoping no one else will find what lies beneath it all
I think I hide it all so well

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

Looking through the crowd
I search for something else
But every time I turn around
I run into myself
Here I stand
Consumed with my surroundings
Just another day
Of everybody looking
I swore they'd never see me cry
You'll never see me cry

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows
Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows

You say I'll pay the price
That's the chance that I'll take
Though you may think I'm telling lies
But I just call it getting by

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can't erase from my life
Everybody knows

Standing out so you won't forget my name
That's the way we play this game of life
Everybody knows I am just barely getting by"

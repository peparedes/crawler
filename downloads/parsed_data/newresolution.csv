"event","This weekend I am going back to Houston.  Man, it feels like it should already be thursday or friday.  I hate weeks that go by slow especially when it's only tuesday afternoon.  Last night evey and I drove to Wichita Falls to visit Dano and meet his new puppy.  It was a very fun adventure and he made us dinner.  Passing through small towns makes me sad for some reason, and passing by porn shops that dot the highways with their seductive neon lights serving as a beakon for lonely truck drivers who haven't been with a woman in years makes me just plain depressed...not to mention kind of creeped out.  I can't believe that it's already October.  The weather is still unseasonably warm and humid.  Hopefully this will all give way to cold, autumn nights in the next few weeks.  Sometimes my stomach gets all twisted into knots for I don't even know what reason and I feel like I can't move until the feeling passes and I just stand there alone and take it all in.  Alright this is the end of the most pointless entry ever."

Now im scared thats how id like to be 
All these faces none the same 
How can there be so many personalities 
So many lifeless empty hands 
So many hearts in great demand 
And now my sorrow seems so far away
Until i'm taken by these bolts of pain 
But i turn them off and tuck them away 
till these rainy days that make them stay 
And then i'll cry so hard to these sad songs 
And the words still ring, once here now gone
And they echo through my head everyday 
And i dont think they'll ever go away 
Just like thinking of your childhood home 
But we cant go back we're on our own"

I hate nights when you just lay there in bed and think about how every minute that passes marks less and less time for sleep.  So I got back from math this morning and went back to sleep until about noon.  Then evey and I ate lunch and I went to history.  I have a test in there on friday.  Fuckin shit fuck.  That feels much better.  Sometimes unnecessary cursing is all it takes to brighten my day.  Why the hell am I so tired?  I have felt weird lately.  Not really tired, not really sick.  Don't know what that's all about, but as I always say ...this too shall pass.  I didn't really ever say that very often in the past, but I do now so get over it.

"event","Tonight Evey and I walked around campus for a while and sat on top of a big brick wall.  The air outside it actually getting cool, so it felt nice to sit there and bask in nearly autumn weather.  This song reminds me of last november to the extreme.  My life was so different then.  Weird.  Sorry that I've been writing a lot lately about songs that remind me of things, but if you don't like it then don't read my journal.  Sorry, today is overly confrontational day.  Yesterday my luck turned around when I found out that I got the student government internship that I applied for, but that's not enough to save the misery that will come with failing math.  It's alright though, I'm over it.  I wallowed in self pity for a while yesterday so I'm good now.  Tonight evey and I went to a church group on the night that they were discussing abortion because I wanted to be open minded to hearing the conservative side.  Well everything was fine and good, but then about twenty minutes before it ended the guy basically talked about why abortion is wrong and evil and if you are pro choice you should rethink why you believe that because there is no standing in the arguments for that side.  It was pretty absurd.  I guess I forgot that this was a Christian nation and we don't have separation of church and state.  I'm not even going to get into it, but I learned my lesson.  Don't go to church related functions on a night when you know that their opinions will piss you off.  I actually think that I am becoming increasingly less tolerant, should probably work on that.  What the fuck ever.  No I shouldn't.  Anyway I have class in a few hours so I guess it's time to fain some attempt of sleep.  Damn naps and the sleeplessness that they incite."

"event","So last night turned into a big giant adventure.  Before it all began Evey, Chris, and I went and ate Korean food at a restaurant that we found on campus.  It was really good and the guy there was really nice and he gave us a roll of japanese sushi for free.  After that we returned to our dorm room and got ready to go out for the night.  We got to the frat house around midnight, stormed their liquor supply, and drank, and drank, and drank.  After we drank we had to go visit Keith.  So we stumbled out the door of the frat house and went on our merry way.  When we got to Keith I had a distorted political conversation with his suitemate (lesson: alchohol+politics=bad.  Then we had to walk chris home so we left Maple Hall and began the trek across campus to West Hall where chris lives.  Once we left chris we decided that we needed to swim in a hot tub, so we walked down the street until we got to a friendly looking apartment complex and we found ourselves a pool.  Of course, it was locked up, so we kicked at the lock until it came open and we went inside.  Well the hottub wasn't hot enough for us so we left and began walking back across campus to go back to the frat house for some sweet delicious jello shots.  When we finally got back there were no jello shots left, but somehow I was whisked into an intense political conversation, yet again, with one of the brothers who is a senior and a finance major.  Again alchohol+politics= very very bad.  I don't even know how I got into that one though.  Oh yea I do.  I walked up to him and another one of the brothers that he was talking to after they commented on Evey's antibush pin and called bush a war mongering oil whore.  hehehe anyway it was interesting but the guy started to get a little touchy feely towards the end so we wrapped it up and I went back in the house to find evey.  Next thing we knew we were in the living room hanging out with some friendly folks we had met there.  It was all fun and games until this really drunk guy told me and evey that we either had to make out with each other or with him.  Needless to say we got freaked out and it was about 4:30 in the morning at that point anyway, so we left and went back to our dorm.  It was a fun night, and hopefully tonight we'll have a similar adventure."

I got to use the words goddamed and fuck in an ENGLISH paper, and the whole thing is about a night that I went binge drinking to wash away my failures in life.  It will be glorious.  My professor is so great.  It's weird how if I had written the same paper a few months ago and turned it in I probably would have been suspended, but in college they encourage that sort of thing.  Fucking brilliant.  So tonight Evey and I are going to our first UNT frat party.  Let's hope it doesn't result in anyone getting raped.  It's a fraternity that our friend is pledging for so it should be all fun and games.  It's so bazaar actually staying here for a weekend.  Like not anticipating leaving after my 1:00 class is over, but it feels good to know that I can just take it easy for a weekend.  Besides I have a math exam on monday that will be the demise of me if I don't study like I've never studied before this weekend.  Well that about sums it up.

"event","Today the weirdest thing happened.  I was walking out of my dorm building and I smelled a smell that I swear I haven't smelled since I was a kid, and it was so distinct.  It was the faint smell of lake water mingled with stale cigarette smoke.  It reminded me of when I was younger and I would go to my grandma's friend's lake house and her friends would smoke and play cards on the dock while my brother and I played with her grandkids.  I was so happy those summers.  I wonder whatever became of them.  When I went to my grandparents house last summer they told me that her house had burned to the ground and I didn't really believe it until I stood on the ashes and looked down on the view that we used to see from the screened in porch.  I walked down to the dock and it was all broken up and in ruins.  I could have cried then, but I didn't.  I just thought for a while and then left without a word.  I hate seeing that town and all of the people and places that make it so familiar fall to pieces with age.  I don't even know why I'm writing about this.  It was just that smell."

I haven't been in a thunderstorm in a long time.  If it rains I want to go run through the field in it and roll around in the grass.  I remember one time when Evey, Erin, and I played in a thunderstorm.  We had just gone running and right as we got back to my house the bottom fell out and it started to pour.  It was one of those thunderstorms where there's constant lightening and thunder and every time you think it might strike you, but the cold rain feels so good that you can't pull yourself out of it. In that moment you feel so close to everyone.  You feel like you'll be young forever and nothing will ever change.  I wonder if I'll still play in the rain twenty years from now.  Hopefully I will because if there were ever a time that it was raining and I didn't feel compelled to go out and play in it I think I wouldn't be the same person anymore.

In highschool you feel so rushed and confined while you walk to class.

Adding their breeze to the summer nights 
Outside, water like air was great

We sat in the grass today for a long time.  It was cool outside and in the shade the grass felt fresh underneath me, and it was comforting on some level.  I slept last night which was a relief.  Perhaps it was the 48 hours of sleeplessness that preceded last night, but anyway I slept more peacefully than I have since I got here.  It's the dreams that keep me up all night usually.  Every time I find a few moments of rest on comes either a really horrifying dream or a really bazaar one, but they always pull me out of sleep and leave me laying there for hours.  I remember driving in the backseat of evey's car when it was still cool outside listening to this song with all of the windows down leaning my head out of the window.  I felt so alive right then.  Everything seemed in it's right place, and the world looked so beautiful right then as the sun was setting in a perfectly clear sky with everything washed over in purples and golds.  I could have stayed there forever right in that single moment when I felt so free.  I want to feel that way again, right now.

God, I've never felt like this before.  Sometimes I feel completely numb and sometimes I feel like my stomach is going to crawl right up my throat and into my mouth.  I try so hard to hold it in until my eyes are blurred with tears that stream down my face with each inevitable blink.  This isn't me.  This was never me, and I hate that.  I feel like I'm staring down a road that goes on for miles and all I can do is crawl down it until I get to the end.  I can leave on the weekends, but the weeks that fall in between could kill me.

I realized that you can't really define one precise moment that made you especially happy because our lives are more or less lived in eras.  Each stage of life is an era that passes from one to the next without us even really realizing the changes in ourselves.  I also decided that I will not know which was my favorite era until the day I die because then I will have lived them all.  I guess I'll have to wait until then.

"event","Today I applied for a freshman internship into the student government.  I think it would look really good on my transcript.  Other than that all I had today was english class in which we introduced ourselves, had a short discussion and then we were let out after a little over half an hour.  The class was supposed to be an hour and a half.  I guess that's the cool thing about college though.  I hate sitting idle.  When I sit idle I think about things and when I think about things I get sad, and when I get sad I get mad at myself for being sad.  I don't know why I feel sad because it doesn't seem like anyone else does.  This is college.  This is what I have been waiting for ever since freshman year of high school, so why do I want to go home so badly sometimes?  It's weird because when I don't think about it I don't feel sad at all, but in the evenings I start to feel the feeling creeping in.  I guess it's different for me because I didn't have it bad at home.  My parents let me do pretty much whatever I wanted as long as I told them who I was with or where I was going.  It wasn't like I had a need to escape some sort of tyranny.  I think I also have a need to cling to youth and childhood.  As ridiculous as it sounds when I think about it I feel like I can see myself aging and suddenly I am 80 yrs old wondering where all the time went.  Since childhood is over I think I worry that I am almost out of my youth.  It's dumb.  I know.  I wish I wouldn't think so much about stupid stuff that makes me sad.  I'll just have to wait it out.  This too shall pass."

"event","Tonight when I was walking back to my dorm I felt invisible.  I scanned every person that passed me by as if the still, night air concealed my staring eyes.  I wanted to see everyone from an angle that I couldn't make out in the daylight.  As I passed one man I gave him a slight half smile just to see his response because normally when you pass people by at night you both stare at the ground and keep to your business.  Well, he exchanged my timid smile with a look back as if I had actually spat in his face and told him that his illegitiment son is a gay prostitute.  I guess some people don't know how to take a friendly gesture.  At least not at night when every suspicious figure that passes is a potential threat.  I guess the only person I really need to be analyzing anyway is myself.  Sometimes I don't recognize myself.  This girl who once shuddered at the thought of tears and had infinite hopes for the future because that is exactly what it was.  The future.  Every once in a while a memory will dance into my head and coax a lump in my throat to rise until I can't breathe and silent streams of tears roll down my face like a two year old left for the first time at day care.  When the feeling of nostalgia and abandonment pass over me I am still standing there in the same place I was, before the memory swept me into thought, feeling utterly ridiculous with my salty, glistening cheeks."

Everyone else seemed so determined to carry out their tasks for the day, and all I wanted to do was lay in a field of grass and watch the day pass me by without pulling me into it's current.  I always have this need to be outside on these days that aren't hot, but just warm enough to make you feel lethargic.  I woke up this morning and couldn't believe it was only Tuesday.  I couldn't sleep well and in my dreams at least a week had passed me by.  If I could sleep for a week I might just never wake up again."

"event","I finally started class today.  I was ready to begin, and feel productive.  Last night I couldn't sleep really.  I kept waking up and everytime I would fall back to sleep I would have a dream more bazaar than the last.  So all of my classes have been good so far.  I can feel the 4.0 within my grasp.  I have been reading The Bell Jar and I really like it so far.  I read this one part today that really struck me.  She was talking about how she feels like she is sitting in a fig tree with all of her options in life sitting there waiting to be plucked, but she can't choose just one without the others slipping away so they all just rot.  That's how I feel most of the time.  I want so many things in life that I don't know which is the best.  I can't have everything that I want without losing something else that is important to me so I just sit there and watch everything slip away.  I don't want to do that anymore.  I was sad leaving Austin yesterday.  Not like a saddness that I have ever felt before, this one was sharp and harsh enough to leave me paralyzed.  I don't know why I cried so hard.  I guess it was the feeling I have been coping with lately of the loss of a place and a feeling I can never go back to.  I guess I need to pick a fig before I starve to death or go insane.

"event","So evey and I have been getting ourselves into this whole college thing.  I can't wait for us to find cool people to hang out with because so far I have seen a lot of stupid sorority wanna-be looking people, but also a good number of cool people.  I want to become friends with the cool people.  I can't help but miss home sometimes and all of its annoying familiarity.  This is the first step into a world that I don't know anything about, and I think that really scares me when I think about it.  Growing up suddenly goes from this slow monotonous routine and all of the sudden you're going at it full speed.  I am ready for classes to start because that will make it a lot easier to meet fun people because we can really see what they are like instead of these random conversations where you ask the same questions.  What year are you?  What's your major?  Where are you from?  I guess it works because you can always talk about those things without worrying about anything being weird or awkward.  We met this really awesome guy from Washington state named Keith that we have been hanging out with so hopefully there are lots more people like that waiting to be befriended."

"event","Tonight was one of those nights where you feel both extreme joy and extreme sorrow all at the same time.  I have these sporadic memories of random people and events from all of my years here in Copperfeild and it makes me so happy and sad at the same time.  I feel so lucky to have the friends I have and to have had the experiences I have had.  There are so many things I need to say to so many people, but I have such a hard time putting my feelings into words.  Like if I said everything that I feel it would somehow makes it seem less meaningful, or I wouldn't be able to translate what I feel to others.  I realized that I keep feeling like I am going to miss this life, but there is no ""this life"".  It's my life and there are just different parts to the whole.  There is no now and then.  Just experiences and moments that dictate who I am.  It makes it easier.  Realizing that and coming to terms with the proverbial coming of age experience.  Life can seem so complex, but  all of the grey in between the black and white really isn't so blurred if you sit down and think about it.  I guess that is what really defines us.  Not the black and white but the grey in between.  The hidden messages that we overlook because we are so caught up in everything that we are trying to accomplish.  That is what I need to work on in the future.  Reading between the lines."

"event","So last night was really fun.  I hung out with Erin and Sara and around midnight we went and sat in the parking lot at Langham.  I think we all needed to see it one last time and be in it's presence.  It doesn't seem half as foreboding when you know you don't have to wake up at 6 in the morning to be there by 7:30.  Anyway I think we all needed some kind of closure.  It was like a ritual.  It was almost as though if we hadn't sat outside of it and talked about our excitement and fear of the future we would have been right there this morning with the rest of them going on with the first day of school.  You would think that graduation would finalize everything, but you don't really feel how final it is until that old life starts the yearly grind and you are left for those few pivotal weeks to watch it all as a silent observer before you go on with your new life in your college town.  I have been thinking a lot lately about how strange it will be to be in a whole new setting in a whole new town full of new people.  Last night I really, for the first time, felt ready.  It's time to move on and see what I can make of myself."

I mean I do have enough time, but everytime I open a closet or a drawer in my room I find myself promptly shutting it and trying to forget that it's contents exist.  I hate rumaging through clutter.  Sometimes it's fun to look at old letters or toys and whatnot, but lately I just haven't wanted to take on the task.  It's annoying because I really need to.  There are too many things to do.  There are twelve days left until I go off to school.  It's weird that in twelve days I will be moving out of my house.  That seems like such an adult thing to do.  I know everyone does it and going off to college isn't exactly stepping into the real world but just the idea of moving out of my parents house is weird.  Exciting, but scary.  I don't feel like an adult at all.  I don't think that I ever will, honestly."

Sometimes you just have to make yourself look presentable even if there is no real point in doing it.  My car is going to finally be ready today.  It was supposed to be ready yesterday but they accidentally painted the bumper the wrong shade of red so they had to go back and do it over.  I wanted to go back to school shopping today but I don't want to have anything to do with tax free weekend.  Battling crazed soccer mom's for a parking spot only to throw myself into the mosh pit of bargain shoppers is not my cup of tea.  I'll wait until next week I guess.  Time for a lazy day parade."

"event","I got back from florida today.  It was a lot of fun and I loved getting to see my cousins and aunt and uncle because I don't ever get to see them.  Airplane flights are so weird.  Every time I fly it's the same damn routine.  I get comfortable on the runway.  No big deal we will just take off and get there and everything will be fine.  Then it slowly rises in me. It's that sickening fear of impending doom that I tend to get every so often.  Anyway, we take off and I watch the world slip out from under me and I have this need to get the hell off, but I know that is unrealistic so I shut my eyes in vain to try, in some meager attempt, to trick myself into falling asleep.  It never works.  Once the plane levels off I am fine for the rest of the flight.  I don't know what it is about those take offs, but they twist my stomach into knots every time.  I love landing though.  Landing is so peaceful.  There is something almost holy about the whole ordeal.  You watch the movement of the tiny insignificant objects below and you feel like you know something that they don't.  You have some detached knowledge about each tiny picturesque suburb from that height.  I guess these thoughts come over me when I know I am looking at things from a different angle.  I wish I could get an aerial view of the world more often.  I want to ride in a hot air balloon.  When I was a little kid every saturday morning there would be masses of all different hot air balloons rising from behind our fence and ascending into the sky to go anywhere but those blank fields that are now lined with even more blank houses filled with even more blank people.  At least those balloons added some color to this place.  Now it all seems so bland."

"event","So much to do today.  So much to do that I don't want to do.  God I really just want to lay in bed all day and never have to get up again.  That wouldn't be life though, so we get up every morning and carry out some sort of routine so that we can remember why we are alive.  I always feel uneasy the day before I fly anywhere.  I can't really explain it.  Summertime has rendured me utterly lethargic and I don't know exactly how to shake this feeling.  I guess that everything amasses and I just got burried.  There are life changes that are about to sweep me away and I still feel, on some level, like I'm fighting the current.  Ok I am getting up and moving out now.  I am a functional human that does my part in society.  Alright.  


Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

"event","I leave day after tomarrow to go to Orlando.  I hate flying.  I wish there was another way.  Who had the brilliant idea that it would be neat for a giant machine to hurl through the air going hundreds of miles per hour to carry innocent civilians from one location to another.  One sick fuck that's who.  Actually I guess it was two of them.  Anyway it's a fear I need to get over.  Today I didn't really do anything.  We just hung out and ate chinese food and watched discovery specials on shark attacks.  That would be a horrible way to die.  One minute you are swimming in the ocean and the next thing you know a massive fish type animal with razor sharp jaws of death is devouring you alive.  Regardless of that set-back I still love swimming in the ocean.  When we were at St. Thomas I swam out so far.  I couldn't even decipher between shapes on the shore, and it was just me that far away.  No one else ventured that far off shore and I made a few attempts to swim to the bottom.  The water must have been fifty feet deep there, but it was so clear I could see the bottom the whole time.  I want to swim in the ocean again come to think of it.  I have unreasonable fears.  The sight of a tiny red insect will send me into hysterics, but when it comes to things that I really should fear I seem to be oblivious sometimes.  School is going to start in little over a month and we move in less than a month from today.  This summer has been crazy.  It seems like certain events took place years ago, but the whole damn thing has gone by fast over all.  I am excited for school but not ready to leave my friends at the same time.  Things will work out though.  They have a strange way of doing that."

"event","oooooooooooooh boy.  what a weekend i could have had!  THursday I was all set to go see the Our Lady Peace concert - and didn't because my parents suck - they said i couldn't got to something like that until i got my grades up - but of course were not inclined to inform me of this until moments before i walked out the door.  Friday I was going to go to a punk show with a friend of mine, saturday i was going to chill with my friend colleen and go out for ice cream, and sunday i was invited to chill with the guy that i like.
but no!  my parents decided it would be so much fun to drag our entire family to see my aunt and uncle and cousins in long island.
it sucked.
ok, admitedly i did catch a mets game, which was pretty cool (mets beat the marlins 5-4, and piazza hit a sweet home run in the sixth or seventh inning - it was a really good game, 4 double plays) but still - honestly i really wanted to be able to just chill with my friends this weekend.
oh well, life goes on, or so they tell me.  i have yet to see.
maybe he'll wanna get together next weekend? i'll keep my fingers crossed, but i'm not holding my breath.  
sooooooo - my schoolyear draws to a close, and i can't wait for summer - liberation in the form of a license.  
they say that it is an ill wind that blows no good - my mother is that ill wind.
more on that later
peace, love, happiness, freedom, and un-privatized water rights to all of you

"event","so summer has finally graced her presence upon central new york, and the trees burst into leaves in thanks.  i'm shocked at how beautiful it is after so many months of misery!
only this morning it was a lazy gray drizzling rainy day until about 2:30 - just in time for me to get out of school.  then i rode the bus to my friend colleen's house, singing inside at the blue skies, and the warm breeze, and the birds, and the flowers, and everything!!!!
i felt like a character in the first half of an early disney movie.
colleen and i took a very long walk up a very steep hill to get some very good ice cream. and i felt like a kid again!!  most of my summers are spent like that, just chilling with colleen and my sister.  we're like a little threesome - it's actually really cool.  if god had had any sense way back in the early to mid eighties colleen would be my sister. 
but i'm not in the mood to discuss god - in fact, i'm not in the mood to sit at this computer anymore. ciao you all! i'm gonna go play run the bases in the beautiful sunshine!!
peace, love, happiness, and FUN!!!

"event","Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

so that kinda sums up my mood for today.  a whole shitload of stuff is going on - and i don't really have the slightest clue as to what it all means.Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A.

i mean - what the hell does that all mean?  don't get me wrong - i love bob, but - -  just how stoned was he when he wrote this???????
i've never been that stoned that i remember - or at least i've never written anything while being that stoned. 

so anyway - this kinda sums up my day - and lemme explain why - i woke up pretty early, 'cause there was this picnic thing at my church and we were helping set up, so we had to go to an earlier mass.
during mass the windows are open and two pigeons fly in during the second reading (although this seems to have no effect on anything else - just remember it - it has bearing later on, i promise)

so after mass i help set up and all that - then i go to help my friend sarah set up for the talent show she's running during the picnic thing.  i'm on general kid control, sound control (with mikes and music) and basic prop control.  (this seems like a lot - sarah was really stressed out, and due to my upbringing i can handle a lot without wigging out.)
so anyway - then we run the talent show - which was a circus, a zoo, and a semi-organized protest all rolled into one.  then i eat (by this time i'm starving) 
now comes the really really wierd part
we have to chase the pigeons out of the church.

so i'm leaping and running around this big, beautiful old building filled with stone arches and stained glass, and gilt-worked edges throwing tennis balls at the goddamn birds.
this building is where i've gone to mass ever since i can remember.  i learned to pray here, i  made my first reconcilliation, my first communion, my confirmation here.  I've sung here countless times.  this place is always quiet, reserved, sacred, beautiful.
except just then.
it was surreal - it's all i can say.
and in the end, the goddamn pigeons are still in there, probably crapping all over the tabernacle and making nests in the rose window.
god made pot - then he tried it - then he made pigeons (taken from my grandmother, and slightly paraphrased)"

"event","ok, i just wrote a little while ago, i know, but i'm bored, gimme a break.  I'm supposed to be doing chores, practicing the guitair, doing the labs i owe for the regents, taking my brother and his friends for a walk down to mobil so they can skateboard and buy candy, and a thousand other things - but i'm not, i'm sitting here and typing.

this seems to be happening a lot lately.

at least there aren't any old men imming me.  my sister is home (oh joy) she likes to lord it over me that she's an inch and a half taller than me, while two years younger than me.  she is pop-cultures dream come true.  she can't honestly think for herself, she acts only so that her friends will admire her - she is shallow.

well - that is the image that she sends.  for real, like, inside, she's not like that, but for some reason she thinks its cool to appear that way.  this really bothers me.  how can a person like that be my sister? i mean - she listens to dream and vitamin C and pink (triple yucks) and thinks that the biggest problem she'll ever face is what shoes to wear with a black mid-thigh skirt.  how is it that she and i came from the same parents, while my cousin and i (who resemble each other in every way besides looks) are not even blood relatives?

i hate it when people say that we look like twins, if i wasn't a pacifist i'd probably smack 'em in the face.

oy

my aunt called yesterday - she wants me to spend august down there as a live-in sitter, like i did last year (x-cept last year i spent all of july and August)  i agreed - it was actually pretty fun, and i made money, and jenny and philip - if a little stubborn and opinionated, are good kids, so i'm doing it.

well - i better go before the day is gone without me doing anything constructive, before another perv ims me.

peace, love, happiness, and productivity (if applicable) to you all

"event","last night i'm online, minding my own buisiness - and it's pretty late, like 12:30 or something, so very few of my friends are on (my aol buddy list y'see)  so i'm just kinda chillin and messing around, and this guy ims me.  He put a search of profiles for single females in the town that i live in, so he ims me saying, ""so you're home on a saturday night?""  and i'm like ""uuh, do i know you?""  and he's like ""not yet"" i'm sure, thinking he's all smooth, a real ladies man.  so i'm like, ""um ok, what does that mean?""  he goes, ""i'm in town for the weekend, i'm looking for some company""
i go, ""UUh, how old are you?""  he goes, ""30""
i almost fell out of my seat laughing, picturing this buisness man, with a hairy back and a little bit of a beer belly, a receding hairline, and WRINKLES!!!!
i felt bad, though.  
of course, what kind of a lifeless wierdo searches PROFILES to find a date?  it's too risky, especially for the poor chica he ims!
can you imagine?  he actually thought i was gonna meet him for drinks or something!!  
society sure trains men for certain expectations, yuck.  how could somebody be so damn sure of themselves like that? it grosses me out.  
but anyway, it gets better.  when i tell him that the 14 year age difference would be a problem in us ""being company"" he says (and i quote) ""Oh, you're not interested in older men?""
again, i fell out of my chair laughing.
so i say, ""Oh, sure, but older as in like, 18, or possibly 19 - not and never 30""
now i have a 20 year-old imming me.  i don't know how my profile (newly perfected) makes me so appealing!!! i mean, it's pretty obvious (at least to me) from my profile that i'm a teenager. here, lemme show you:Member Name:	Kate
Location:	New York
Sex:	Female
Marital Status:	single
Hobbies:	theater (acting), talking, singing, writing, laughing, talking, listening to music, attempting to play music, did i mention talking? chilling with my friends, however, remains my favorite thing to do, so sarah & colleen, don't say i never appreciate you!
Computers:	""In solitude, when we are least alone."" (my marital status) i take it to mean that when you're single, you're the least alone.
Occupation:	smoker, joker, midnight talker,  professional doors fan, and general good-time-haver - i make no $, so send me some, please?
Personal Quote:	""The wait is long but the end is near, already the fiesta has begun."" ~Bob Dylan   ""What's my age again?"" ~Blink 182   ""Laughter is the music of the soul""  ~ anonymous  ""I don't feel I have to explain my art to you, warren.""  ~Empire records
and here's my other one:
Name:	Katie
Location:	syracuse, ny
Sex:	Female
Marital Status:	single & lovin it!
Hobbies:	having a hell of a great time with my sisters: AA, SF, CG, and JS and all my buds - - theater, singing, writing, listening to music, attempting to skate without falling on my ass, playing music
Computers:	""in solitude, when we are least alone"" ~Byron (just 'cause you're single, it doesn't mean you're alone.)
Occupation:	student @ ludden, babysitter, and professional smile
Personal Quote:	""When you ain't got nothin', you ain't got nothin' to lose"" ~Bob Dylan     ""A life without laughter is no life at all"" ~anonymous    ""To be a martyr to the cause, you must first live for the cause."" ~anonymous

so - doesn't it seem like there's too many pervertd old men in the world? or maybe i'm just being naive, and my profile is a magnet to perverts.  that's entirely possible.  i don't see how though, i mean, i don't say like, ""I'm a 16-year old who loves to party, but can't keep her legs closed.""
now this 20-year old wants to meet me.  I'm a little wierded out.  ok, so much for my celebration of profile perfection - maybe i should put in that i'm a 60-year old woman with cats who spends her friday nights knitting.  oh well - please comment on this if you can tell me why my profile is so appealing to old(er) men.
my naivete is depressing me. i'm going to get some chocolate.
peace, love, happiness to all of you.

"event","so, ok, another evening wasted i suppose.  ok, don't get me wrong, i love my friend (we'll call her Cindy) Cindy, she's one of my best friends, she's like my sister, but sometimes she just makes me nuts!  
tonight, we were supposed to get together and do something, so my sister decides we'll go to the mall.  she doesn't want to, so we decide to go see knights tale.  fine, cool, i don't care all that much, i've been dying to see knights tale anyway.
so then she calls, she can't go to the movies, she has to go to the mall with one of her other friends.  yeah, no shit, and you think that's bad?
just wait

so she says she'll have us over after she gets back, we'll sleep over there.  but then we can't because the house is full (her three older siblings are all home for the weekend) ok, that's not a big deal, she can't help that her sibs are home, she can always sleep here. 
but then, later, no, she can't sleep here, she has her cousin over, and has to stay and chill with him. so anyway, long story finished, i sit here typing in my fucking journal instead of chilling and watching chick flicks and having fun.
ok, i'm so unbelieveably pissed.
peace, love, happiness to you, even if i can't have it.

"event","""Mes yeux sont les fenetres de mon ceour(sp?)"" somebody important said that, (my eyes are the windows to my heart) but i disagree. to me, my profile is the window to my heart.  my aol profile, i mean - and i finally perfected it.  with the exact right blend of inside jokes, shoutouts, miscillaneuos quotes, and assorted me-ness, i have acheived profile perfection, and i firmly believe that somebody who reads my profile, and has never met me, will know ""me"".
this is a very important thing, in my opinion - especially with all these sudden on-line romances.  i could certainly do with a romance or two right about now.  (of course, when couldn't i?)  
anyway - i feel that this is a time for celebration, so here i sit with a code red mountain dew (never as good as the original, but what the hell?) a carmel-dripped chocolate-frosted brownie, and listening to shaggy's ""angel"" (not my typical music genre, but nonetheless a damn good song - better than the original)
a lot of work faces me this weekend.  i have a whole shitload of labs i have to do for the regents, i have to run a couple of errands, i have to go see knights tale with my chica sistas, there's a talent show i'm playing in on sunday, so i have to re-tune my guitair (i've been practicing more often lately YAAAY ME!)  i have to attain inner peace and spiritual completion - no, just kidding - i'll never get there at this rate.
but am i doing any of the things i desperately need to be doing? nope! i'm typing this inane journal entry so that all the world can see my deepest thoughts.  my priorities are only the teeniest bit fucked up, doncha think?
ok, well, my mountain dew is almost gone, and my celebratory mood is a little dampened by the reminder of my responsibilities - so i'll tty another time.
peace, love, and happiness to you all!

"event","ok, i'm not gonna re-state my bio, but this is my first entry, so just bear with me. :-)  I'm Katie - as the top of this page states, as of now i'm 16 years old, i'll be seventeen in a month and a half (Hence, my b-day is in July, in case you want to send me an e-card, feel free) I don't have my liscence.  this is one of the many points of argument between me and my parents.  I have my permit, but no liscence.  I'm kind of a tomboy, and i consider myself to be down-to-earth, unlike the majority of girls my age.  one of the greates compliments i ever got was from a friend of mine, I'll call him ""Bob"" we were discussing another friend of ours who's parents had come into money, and now was acting really stuck-up.  ""bob"" says, ""He thinks that just 'cause he's got a big house and everything he's better than us."" I say, ""yeah, but that's not all of it, I mean, I have a big house."" and ""bob"" responds, ""yeah, but you're Katie, even if you was fuckin' bill gates, you'd still be the same""
i was touched.
so that's what i like to consider myself to be, a good person (knock on wood) if a tad superstitious.

ok, so anyway, i had an encellent day today.  i got away with stealing the log (my bio teacher's mascot) and we (me and my ""merry"" womyn"") wrote the funniest ransom note.  it was all cut out of magazines and newspapers, and it said 
     ""If you ever want to see your log again leave 70 shiney 1967 pennies on the 2nd seat of bus # 189.""   
unfortunately, he (my bio teacher) didn't think it was nearly as funny as we did.  oh well, he got the log back, and without even paying the 70 cents
so what else was so good about today? oh yeah, i served a detention (i'm booked through the week) and got to wander the halls the whole 30 minutes.  I got a great grade on my math test, i played pitch, and almost won, in french, and in religion had a long chat with one of my very good friends.
plus i spent the after-school time with a good friend of mine who i think i like.  You know what i mean, you're not quite sure but you like being around them, and they're fun, so you wanna kinda see how things turn out?
well - that's what it's like for me, and he's already heard that i like him, so it's not like i'm fucking with anybody's mind.
oh yah, i ate at burger king for dinner (instead of attempting to digest my mother's food) [don't tell her i said that, it's sad & mean, but true - she can't cook]  and my dad took me and my sis's to the park to play catch - which i haven't done with him in the longest time.
yeah - it's a little girl thing, i know, but i'm a daddy's girl (and not in the dirty way) through and through.  when i was in europe i had to go 11 straight days without talking to him, and you can ask the girl i roomed with, i was completely wigging out.  
because me and my mom don't get along at all, my dad is like my favorite person in the world - but don't tell him i said that, he can be such a jackass sometimes.
we-ell, i think that's all i've got time for today.  so there ya go, there's some of me.
peace, love, happiness,

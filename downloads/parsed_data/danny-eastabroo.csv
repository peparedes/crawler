"event","Why cant I get a girl that i actually like??? And a girl that actually likes me for me??? The only girls that like me are fake girls that like me for the simple fact that I have long hair, I skateboard, and I play guitar. Im really sick of it. I think I am destined to go out with someone I dont like. I havent had someone to hold in so long I think I might just go out with one of those girls. Lord knows there is like a thousand. I know what everyone would say. They would say, ""You'll find that girl one day. Just be patient."" Fuck that. If I thought I already found her and she doesnt feel the same then what the hell? Am I not supposed like ""that girl"" or something? I WILL get a girlfriend that I like. I dont know how but I will never stop trying. Never.


Thats really pathetic how guys like girls and the girls they like, like another guy. Yet they never stop trying. Really pathetic."

has been an ok day at work. Still at work late but this is ok keeping the mind off of that which is driving me crazy.  Need to work on review for work over the last year not just the last two months. 
I am thankful to just have the job after my personal stuff kinda stop life for a week or two still miss erica but I am doing my best not to call her would be great to hear from new people. Or even just others Have to admit that some really great people have step up to the plate and have helped out greatly. So I am not taking any one out at this time Other then my self ego goes up and down finding that I still care for all the different parts just that I wish I could let go more then I have they may not be a possible but that I will make it on to the next day. Strange dream or waking dream I have had the last Two days. Holding someone in my arms and watching children play on the play set in my back yard, the Strange part is that the Play set is Brand new in the Dream state and very peaceful with whom I am holding in my arms.  Well maybe just a vision of Peace for the mind with all the other events going on.

Well at least I have work :) system is down for a bit here this morning so I have a chance to update what has been going on. not that there is much other then sellling house and wondering where I will be after that. Jeri and I seem to talk less and less as the days go by. no realy supprise there. Finding that talking to others seems to keep my head out of the depression that hides around the conner. Keep smilling and I am working on it, New friends just moved into house sounds great, Other great people keep a house of Three going strong WOW I should take a hint. Well mikey has made it on my own before will do again. With some realy great support from friends. :) THank you to all of you !!! for that other wise I would not be here.  Ramboling time for Michael... Party time Saturday YEAH !!!"

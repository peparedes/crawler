"event","well i definately havent updated in like 2 months. the last two months have been ok i guess. school started. its ok i guess. actually it blows. ojt was really gay for like 5 weeks until mr. v finally showed up. now its bombass. math sucks. english is ok. i really like my psych class at bcc. i have a lot of fun with that.

i bought a mustang about a month ago i guess. i love it. its pretty quick and everyone knows that the car being fast is the most important thing. 

ive been hanging out with shaun, jamie, jeremy, and josh lately. its pretty coool. last night me, shaun amd jeremy went to price's party. it was pretty cool. i had a good time. this dude steve made me laugh like all night. probably because of the 6 kaluas he had. there were some sweet cars there too. there was a blue acura, a blue civic, and silver civic with a vortech supercharger, and a badass black trans am that put like 450 to the wheels. oh yeah and there was my mustang putting like 280-290 to the wheels. it wasnt the slowest car there but it wasnt that trans am either. the party was real fun all together though. even though the strippers didnt show up. 

well i guess ill stop writing now...and ill write again probably in a month or two...

Brad and I went and watched Saw at the movies theatre last night. Can you say FUCKED UP? man that movie was insane. I was shocked. it was ri-goddamn-diculis. I saw Allison there...she didnt even look at me. I guess shes pretty mad. I hope she knows that Im really sorry.

Tomorrow is school. i really dont want to go. I dont want to hear people asking me about why i broke up with her and things like that. Its gonna be GAY. but i will get to have lunch with preeti again...that will be nice.

Ive decided that mustangs are cool now. i didnt used to like them but i do now. and i think im gonna buy one. or two. well see what happens.

"event","today was really good. i hung out with allison for a long time today. it was really nice. shes a real sweetheart. 

i went to youth group tonight for the first time in a long time tonight. it was cool. we talked about politics and the war. it made me realize something...Bush is just another president. everybody sais that he sent our soldiers over seas to die...that hes killed innocent people in Iraqi towns, and things like that. I guess nobodys realizes that a lot of our other presidents have done the same thing. in the 40s over 400, 000 people died in WWII. America dropped nuclear bombs and two japanese cities, killing thousands. Nobody talks about that anymore. people just say that bush is a bad president because he sent troops to Iraq. They only say that because its happening now...just like they said when it happened in the 60s with Viet Nam. Operation Iraqi Freedom is the Veit Nam of our generation."

By far the greatest thing to happen lately has been me and Allison goin out. Its awesome. I like her so much. Tuesday we went on a double date with Josh and Melisa. We went to the movies, then out to eat, then to Cocoa Beach at night. It was really nice. There was a nice breeze and a full moon. It was wonderful. What better place than on the beach, at night, under a full moon to have your first kiss, huh? It was perfect."

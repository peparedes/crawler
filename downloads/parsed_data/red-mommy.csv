"event","This economy sucks!  I've been trying to find a job in Salem for almost 2 months.  I had one interview that I thought went perfectly, they called me back in for a second interview which consisted of me actually working for the day!  It was so much fun.  It's a receptionist at a, get this, water birthing center!  Amazing place, I could also do post-partum care when they needed someone because I have a CNA.  The only bad things that I could foresee were having major baby fever from all of the squishy cuteness and having birthing jealousy from all of the perfect water births going on.  Anyways, i thought it went very well and they told me they would let me know by the end of the week, which would have been Friday.  Well, it's Monday night.  I called on Wednesday and left a message to let them know that I enjoyed myself very much and thought I would be perfect for the position.  I'm kind of pissed about it because they were supposed to pay me for the day I worked.  I think it's incredibly rude to say you're going to call and not.  Especially when it's something as important as a job.

I've been thinking today that I should just go back to school.  Josh is making enough money that if we lived frugally and I got some sort of assistance we could make it.  If I busted ass and got a Bachelors in 2 years I could get a job and Josh could go to school for his MBA, which is what he really wants to do.  It could work.  

Oh yeah, I'm divorced officially!  Yay!!  I should be getting 16,000 within the next couple of months, then 4,000 by the end of the year.  And I get to claim Rowyn for my taxes again this year.  That will help a lot."

"event","Okay, it's been a while and a lot has changed.  

Still not divorced.  Not even close.  Jason wants to get away with giving me 20% of the sale of the house and have Rowyn for a week every other month.  20% would not even cover the part of the bills I have to pay and I need a new car. I still think a week is too long for her to be away.

This is never ending.

New job.  I'm a certified nursing assistant.  I work in a super nice, super expensive retirement home.  I like it and I'm good at it.  Can't decide if I want to go to nursing school or if I want to move to Bellevue to go to ultrasound tech school.  I don't know how I would survive not living close to my parents, but I would much rather be an ultrasound tech.  Maybe there will be a way.

New boy.  Name's Oliver, I really like him.  We've actually been dating for about 5 months.  I just met his whole family this past weekend.  His brother got married, it was really nice.  Rowyn loves him.  Speaking of Rowyn...    She's really tall and beautiful.  She talks all of the time and pees in the potty some of the time!  She's being very picky about eating but we're working on it.  

I think that's it"

"event","So, I talked about the guy I liked in a post before and I still like him, but maybe not as much now.  We've only been seeing each other casually for a little over a month, and by casually I mean we only see other once a week or so.  It's completely different dating when you have a child, especially living with my parents.  If I lived on my own at least he would be able to come to my house after Rowyn was asleep or something.  Anyways, we don't see each other much and I'm already bored.  I feel like I have to push him into asking me over.  For example: Instead of asking me when Rowyn is going with her dad, I have to tell him, ""Oh, by the way Rowyn's leaving on Monday.""  Then he says ""Well, you can come over if you want.""  Ugh!!  That's not an invite!  I know I should probably just talk to him about it, but I feel like such a high schooler.  I'm really attracted to him and like spending time with him, but I want to feel like the person I like spending time with likes spending time with me too!

Another boy problem:

I went on a couple dates with a different guy (I know, crazy) and we seemed to be hitting it off.  I wasn't super attracted to him (we never even kissed), but I liked talking to him and things were going well.  The last I heard from him was Tuesday last week.  He sent me an email asking if I wanted to plan a trip to the coast and he mentioned that he really liked getting to know me and thought I was intelligent and beautiful to boot!  I sent an email back saying the normal, I feel the same way, yes let's plan a trip to the coast.  Never to hear from him again!!  What is that?!?  Do guys think it's okay to leave us hanging like that?  No big deal if you just decided you didn't want to hang out or met someone else, fine.  JUST LET ME KNOW!!  The weird thing was the really nice email he had sent saying how much he liked me, then nothing.  

Jason problems:

I want to put Rowyn in a Montessori School.  Jason doesn't want to spend the extra money, he wants to put her in a home daycare so she'll still have social interaction.  I'm not comfortable with that.  If she's going to be in someones home, it's going to be my moms home.  I know what my mom feeds her, I know how she disciplines her and I know that nothing weird is going on.  Jason found a home daycare on Craigslist that he is raving about.  I called the lady and she was way too accommodating.  It made me wonder what the hell Jason told her about me.  She said she wouldn't charge for the days that she doesn't have her, she wouldn't charge me for picking her up late (she closed at 6, I wouldn't get there until 6:30)she would even feed Rowyn dinner.  Who does that?  It was fishy.  If he cared at all about Rowyn he would want her to go to Montessori School and start out with a really good education.  Especially while we can afford it.  What's he thinking?

Rowyn (not a problem!):

She is so cool!  She has a toddler bed and she loves it.  She climbs in it randomly to lay her head on the pillow and read a book!  She talks a lot now.  Sometimes I have no idea what she's saying, but we have conversations anyway.  Her Grandad is still her favorite person, they lay on the couch together and play and learn about new things.  She's getting a little picky in her eating habits, but I expected that.  She still loves carrots and peas.  She runs full speed now and is accident prone.  She's always bumping her head or chin or knees.  She doesn't cry about it, though, she's pretty tough.

Okay that's it!"

"event","So, the new boy kind of sort of asked me to be his girlfriend.  He's really sweet.  I had a date with someone else and told him about it and he told me he didn't like the feeling he got when I told him about my date.  I told him if I had known that he wouldn't like it then I wouldn't have gone and he said well, now you know.  I told him I wasn't sure about being a girlfriend, yet, but that I wouldn't see anyone else if he wouldn't.  So there you go!  

I love this feeling!  I had forgotten all about it.  I hope to find the person some day that gives me this feeling all of the time.  Usually it goes away after the newness of the relationship wears off.  My mom swears that she still has that feeling with my dad.  I don't remember ever having that feeling with Jason, I'm sure I did, though.  I remember it in all of my previous relationships, especially Josh, I can't believe I still think about him.  We had the perfect relationship, I loved him so much.

On another topic, Jason (stbx) and I had a very good conversation last week!  We talked about Rowyn and how we both want the best for her.  We talked about the visitation and what is working and what's not working and how we can try to fix it.  He wants to consolidate his visit to one full week of her down in California with him.  I'm a little wary of that but may offer 5-6 days because I worry when he has his visit up here and they stay in a hotel.  One consolidated visit might be best for her, I'm just not sure I'm ready (or Rowyn's ready) for one whole week.  He said he can't afford the Montessori School that I picked out and wants to keep looking.  I really want her to go there, I'm pretty sure it's my choice and he has to pay.  Hopefully I don't have trouble with that.

I've been feeling really good lately and am happy with the way mine and Rowyn's lives are headed.  I hope to be moved out of the parents house by the end of the summer and living in Portland close to work.  I also hope to be divorced by then!!"

"event","I like a boy.  I have never felt this way about anyone.  I've been talking to this guy on the internet since January, I met him 2 weeks ago and I'm falling hard.  He came over and met Rowyn on Sunday (I know fast) and they loved each other.  They kept giving each other eskimo kisses, I almost died from the cute!  He helped me put her new big girl bed together.  We had to go to Ikea because I forgot to buy the slats that go with the bed (shouldn't they come with it? ridiculous) and when we were walking inside Rowyn was holding my hand and she reached up to hold his too.  It was cute.  I might like him too much.  Geez, I'm still married.  

I have that giddy feeling that I almost forgot about.  Usually it takes me a while to start being attracted to a guy after I meet him, like he has to grow on me or something, but this one I liked from the beginning.  He makes me laugh and feel really good about myself.  He thinks I'm pretty and tells me it.  He told me he adores Rowyn and already has a nickname for her (Winnie).  He's educated (Masters in Microbiology) and young (30).  He's interested in the same TV shows I am, we're both Big Brother fans and we both want Ryan to win and think Josh is an asshole.  

Ahhhhhh, I like him!!!"

"event","Rowyn likes my mom more than me now.  It's sucks.  I wish I could stay home and be with her all of the time and kiss her owies and listen to her say new words.  A few weeks ago I heard her say ""Nigh-nigh baby"" and I was like oh my goodness she said her first sentence that's amazing and my mom said oh she's says that all the time.

The other day she fell down and ran to my mom crying when I was right next to her.  It made me cry.  I also think she's ready to be potty trained because she wakes up dry almost every morning, but my mom doesn't have the patience to do it.  I never even get a long weekend at work to do it.  

I'm going to check out a Montessori school on Teusday.  If I like it, Rowyn will go there from 8am-5 and my mom will pick her up and feed her dinner so I can spend some time with her when I get home at 6:30 and put her to bed around 7.  Isn't that ridiculous?  I'll get half an hour in the evening to see my daughter.  

I hope I have the money to rent an apartment in Portland by summertime.  I think it'll be a lot easier.  I'll be able to get up around 7 and spend a couple of hours with her getting ready for work and daycare, then pick her up at 5:30 and be able to get home in just a few minutes.  My mom likes to tell me that I'll be miserable without her help, but I absolutely cannot stay here for much longer.  I'm going crazy, I feel like I'm 15 again.  When Rowyn was with Jason last weekend I stayed the night out one night and my parents freaked out!  Like I'm a kid."

Why can't the judge or the police or her family make her go into a mental hospital?  The pictures of her are so scary, she's laughing in some of them and smiling at the people that have tied her to a gurney.  You'd think she'd be a little upset.  I hope her kids are okay. Can you imagine what they're thinking?  Being woken up in the middle of the night, scratch that, they were probably still awake, but they must have been terrified to see all those strangers and flashing lights.  It makes me sick.  She has to be seriously sick to be allowing her kids to be in this situation and not want to them to have a normal life.  I'm gonna go throw up.

On a good note, I'm getting a promotion!  On another bad note, I'm in the office by myself today and getting a little overloaded, that's why I decided to post, I needed a little break.  Okay, back to work.

Be more independent. ( I CAN be alone)
Be more outgoing so I can meet new friends.
Lose 10 lbs to get down to 130. (This means I need to eat healthy)
Either move up in my job or have a better job by 2009.
and the most important:
Be a patient and loving mother to my baby. (This will be hard because she'll be 2 this year!)

I can't believe my child will be two this year, and I'll be 25. Yikes!

easel from Ikea ($20!) and markers, chalk, and sticky picture things to go with it
a stool to sit on and draw on the easel
a stepstool for the bathroom
a redhead cabbage patch doll
5 wooden puzzles (from goodwill, no pieces missing)
a stuffed elephant for her jungle themed room)
a jungle playset thing that I can't explain but will put a picture of it later
a tunnel tube thing she can crawl through
a barbecue and lawnmower for summer (goodwill)
a kitty cat thing on wheels that she can pull around

and there's a ton of presents from my parents under the tree that my mom won't tell me about. Probably clothes.

Jason is coming to get her on Wednesday and will bring her back on Sunday.  I'm sure they got her tons of stuff, too.  I know they got her a play kitchen.  I really hope she does well with him.  She hasn't seen him in 2 months, so she'll be scared at first. We'll see how it goes."

Jason claimed to be the primary parent ever since Rowyn was born and the judge said that he found it hard to believe that the stay at home mom for the first seven months of her daughters life wasn't the primary parent. He also said that there was no way he was ordering a psychiatric evaluation with no proof. So all is good. Now we wait for the next hearing, which will be about money."

There's a hearing on Wednesday.  My lawyer very much doubts that he'll get custody of her as he has no proof of me being a drunk or lazy and we have actual proof that he has lied to the judge in a previous order.  But I'm scared to death.  

I had Erin and Sammi and various other friends and family write statements for me.  He had his mom, sister and best friend write the most ridiculous stuff.  Stuff that wasn't even exaggerations, they were all out lies.  His best friends wife even wrote stuff about me and I hardly even knew her.  I tried to be friends with her, but we just didn't mesh, you know?  Some people have completely different personalities that just don't go together.  She has a four year old daughter and went through a lot of marriage problems last year, she actually cheated on her husband.  I just wish I could ask her how she would have felt if he had decided to leave her and tried to take her baby.  She actually was an alcoholic and had depression problems so he may have succeeded.  Why would one mother do this to another mother.  I'm not surprised at his moms, sisters, even his best friends letter but I was very surprised at hers.  

I blocked her from my myspace, I was afraid that if I didn't I would send her a nasty message and they would use it against me.  Writing this made me feel better, though."

"event","So Jason called me yesterday at 4pm and said I flew all the way up here from California let me see my baby now!  I said I was at work but maybe after work if he gives me some money (still haven't seen a child support payment) He got upset and I heard his mother in the background screaming and cussing so I said no sorry you should have given me a little notice before jumping on a plane. What am I supposed to do? Leave work?  

When I got home I had a change of heart, called him and told him he could come see her. This is what he said ""I just sat down to eat dinner, I can't come now.""  Um, WHAT? Get your ass up and come see the child that you haven't seen for a month. I explained to him that it was his only opportunity as he is leaving tonight and I work all day so there's no way he can see her today. And he said he was busy eating dinner!

He wanted to go to moms today to see her but my mom is uncomfortable having him over when I'm not there. Totally understandable.  

If he had freaking called me and let me know what was going on I probably would have let her spend the night with him and all day today.  It would have been nice having a night off.

Does it make sense for him to show up unannounced and expect me to bow down to him?  I don't get it. What the hell is he thinking?"

I don't know if I can do this.  I have a feeling that Jason isn't giving me any money for Rowyn because he wants me to be miserable without him so I'll come back.  And I'm really close to doing that.  I was driving a nice, new SUV, I wasn't working, I was living in a beautiful house... I had everything, but I was miserable.  I think I'm happier now (working my ass off away from my baby all day just for all of my money to be spent on a stupid broken down car)than I was when I was with him.

She told me I need to make a list of the foods that I don't want her to have.  I already told them that she doesn't get juice or cows milk.  I never would have thought that I need to add pumpkin pie with whipped cream to that list.  

When I enrolled Rowyn in that daycare the director made a point to tell me that they have very nutritious foods.  She also gave me a months worth of menus and nowhere did it say pumpkin pie.

"event","So, Rowyn started at the new daycare on Monday.  Monday night and Tuesday night she woke up with bad tummy cramps.  I don't know what it is.  
The daycare fills out a form listing everything she ate and drank, and lists her dirty diapers.  Nothing has been unusual.  The only thing I can think of is that they have been giving her cows milk and juice, which I specifically put on her allergy list.  They are only supposed to give her water.  

Also, last night when I picked her up and brought her home, she was incredibly hyper.  I have never seen her act the way she acted.  She was thrashing around when I was feeding her dinner and after dinner she did about 15 laps around the coffee table.  That makes me think they gave her juice because she's never had a lot of processed sugar.  She's usually very calm and relaxed, especially after 6 pm.  

This morning I made sure to tell her teacher again that she is NOT to have juice or milk.  I hope she doesn't get another tummy ache.  I think I'm going to look for an in home daycare this week.  It's so hard trying to find the right person to watch my baby, though.  I wish I could stay home.  Maybe I can find someone that will pay me $2000 to watch their kid, that would be fun.  Maybe I should start a daycare.  Hmmm, maybe not.  LOL, I though about it for a minute!

It seems ridiculous that I'm paying $1050 a month for this daycare and my baby's getting cramps at night.  For $1050 a month I should be VERY satisfied (and my kid shouldn't be sick!)."

"event","Halloween was a lot fun.  R was a chili pepper!  She was adorable.  We went to the mall and entered her in a costume contest for babies.  She made the semi-finals but got beat out by a really cute pig that only won because she crawled across the stage showing off her costume!  Then we walked around and got stopped about a hundred times by people telling us how darn cute our little pepper was.  Then we went home and handed out candy.  Can't wait until next year when R will be a little more excited about dressing up."

"event","We had a lot of fun on our anniversary trip.  We drove to Moro Bay and Cambria, and saw Hearst Castle.  The weather was beautiful.  The kid was amazing, everyone loved her.  On the Hearst Castle tour everyone commented about how quiet she was.  She slept great in the hotel and woke up in her usual happy mood.  She loved walking around in the mei tai.  
Jason got me the Juicy Couture diaper bag that I had my eye on and I love it.  It's beautiful.  
I've been scrapbooking lately and I'm getting together a really cute baby book.  
I got the baby leg warmers in the mail yesterday and they are so cute.  I can't wait to use them when it starts getting cooler."

"event","So, my baby's a flirt.  I went out againwith my parents to some open houses and she batted her eyelashes, smiled big smiles, squealed in delight, then hid her head in my shoulder.  It was adorable.  Everyone loved her.  When we were eating lunch, the whole table next to us were talking to her and making her smile, they just laughed and said that she made her day.
Jason has been gone all day so I took the chance to clean the whole house.  It looks really nice.  It feels good to have the house to myself with the baby asleep so I can have some alone time."

"event","Today was a good day.  My parents took me and R to dinner and she was good the whole time.  SHe didn't make a fuss, she just looked around.  Everyone was saying what a darn cutie she is!  
My parents are trying to buy a house here.  It's really nice and they'll still be close enough to go over there whenever I need help or when I'm bored.  
I'm looking forward to going to a halloween party, but I'm nervous to leave the babe.  We're planning on putting her to bed around 6:30 at my parents house and then leaving.  We should be back before her usual wake up time.  I'll leave a bottle just in case, though.
It'll be our first time leaving her for more than an hour or so and we'll be about an hour away.  SHe's almose five months old, so I'm sure she'll be fine.
I guess I shouldn't worry."

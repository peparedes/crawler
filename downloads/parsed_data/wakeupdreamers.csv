"event","it's monday and boy am i tired, but i know that if i go to sleep now there is no way i'm going to be able to go to sleep tonight.  tonight is a movie night too so there is no way i can go to sleep.  it's only 5 days til i get to see Reagan and i'm so freakin excited.  it's going to be perfect. . .i hope, if all goes to plan it will.  anyway i think i'm going to just chill out for the rest of the night.  the band i'm in The Night For Kites is playing this friday in arkadelphia so i hope that goes well and i hope all the people that go enjoy it.  well i guess i'm out.  til next time keep dreaming of flying kites of stars in your eyes. . ."

"event","well i woke up rather early today because my mom was coming into town and we went out to eat.  pretty much we just hung out but it was freakin awesome cause i got a lot of food cause we went grocery shoping.  i went to my friend's dad's house to watch the season premiere of the Sopranos cause we don't get HBO around here, really sucks if you ask me. . .well after i got back my friend got online and i was so worried that the girl i talk to everynight wasn't going to be on cause i really love to talk to her.  it's the highlight of my day.  i can't wait til this saturday i'm supposed to drive up to memphis to see her.  i'm so so excited it's going to be the greatest.  just to be able to see her again.  well i think that's pretty much it.  so til next time keep dreaming of kites in the stars of your eyes. . ."

"event","well it's like 5 in the morning and i'm just hanging out on the internet talking with people.  well today was rather uneventful since o wait i slept all freakin day so nothing important happened or that i was awake for at least.  i pretty much spent all night talking to one of the most awesome girls that i've met and oh man am i crushing hard on her. . .she's really amazing the way she talks and her personality, and she is absolutely beautiful, everything about her makes me happy.  well it's like 5 in the morning and she just got off so i think i'm going to get off myself so that i can get a little sleep cause my mom is coming into town tomorrow.  well i guess i'm through posting for the moment, so til next time, simply dream of the kites that are flow in the night sky. . ."

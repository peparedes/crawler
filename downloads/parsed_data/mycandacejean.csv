I have been wanting to do this for a long time, but I can <i>finally</i> say that my journal is moving to a new home. I admit, there are some things about livejournal that I find I will miss, but at the same time I am so tired of it. I've been wanting my domain journal to be ready since I first set it up a long time ago.

It was a bit of a headache, making everything look right and function properly because it runs completely differently than any other html dashboard, and I'm sure I spent much longer holed up in the art room than necessary if only I knew what I was doing.. but I'm DONE!

From now on, please direct your links to my new journal <a href=""http://www.candacejean.com/journal"" target=blank/>*here*</a href>. It is simply: candacejean.com/journal. I've also updated the links on my website to re-direct to my journal's new home, and I didn't even break anything! I also am quite proud of the teeny, cute little favicon I added to my website and new journal. Can you see her on your tabs?

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/journal%20smalls/face.png""></center>
My new journal is also a bit more interactive, has many more links, features and a pretty rotating header, and you can even join my newsletter mailing list there. (Also something I've wanted to initiate for some time.) 

Head over there to read about a new series and new piece that I finally finished, and tell me how you like the place!

Sometimes when certain energies inside take charge for the time being, I can get cranky.
Cough cough.

I don't mean to be rotten. Public apologies to Austin, again. I'm sure my mini bouts of lost temper and pocket-sized fits of silently throwing stockings and stamping my way to the next room are just plain silly, but I do feel bad afterword. It never helps that the moodiness is coupled with the pressure of a deadline and time commitment. IE; ""be to the extended family's house by 5:30 sharp"". 

Have all day long to prepare chocolate cake and pine-nut couscous for a dinner party? No problem.
Out the door (without forgetting anything) and completely ready by the time planned? Hah.

A lot of that frustration had to have come from wondering where the heck my day went and being a bit upset that I had not much in the way of productivity to show for it, and besides.. I wasn't even ready when I should have been, being given the whole day long to do so. Anyway. This all leads me to admitting here that yes, I did not ever post anything to the shop that I had planned on posting before it got to be the holidays. Me, late? Never. (<---- highly sarcastic.)

I had grand ideas all lined up in my brain and on a million stickies and scrap notes that fill my purse and art room. Did I finish any of them? No.. no I didn't. 

Did I finish anything? Well, yes.. in a way. 

I posted a few items to <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/candacejean"">the shop</a href> over the weekend and.. ahem.. just now, that I have been meaning to do for some time. I took some mini-frames with prints inside to Beehive, all strung with ribbon, and found they did very well. So, I posted three to my shop; Charlie, Adele, and The Big Apple:
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/framed_charlie1.jpg"" img size width=200 height=260 style=""border: 4px white solid;""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/framed_bats1.jpg"" img size width=275 height=260 style=""border: 4px white solid;""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/framed_apple2.jpg"" img size width=200 height=260 style=""border: 4px white solid;""></center>

A Big Apple brooch (*swoon*) made it there as well, and so did a mysterious little 'eggsperiment'. 
More oddities to come I'm sure. Someday.

Before picking up Alden from school, Austin and I sneaked off to Toys R Us and grabbed some things for Alden for Christmas. I get so happy just imagining his excitement upon opening his gifts; I can't wait! 

Once at home we got out the Christmas box from the garage and started to unpack everything. I really, <i>really</i> wanted a new tree this year; I felt that in a new, nice house my little, four foot 'shrub' of an artificial tree just wouldn't cut it. Sadly, the tree I had my heart set on was too expensive for now, and sold out before I could even muster a way to afford one. So, we set up the old, tiny tree on a side table. 
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/decor04.jpg"" img size width=300 height=435></center>
<br>
Poor little tree.. it's tried so hard all of these years... I suppose it will be fine again for at least one more. After all, it is the tree Alden has grown up with.

<center>******</center>
While we put everything out I played Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker in the background. 

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/tchaikovsky20-20web20larger.jpg""></center>

I actually <i>despise</i> Christmas music (sorry to sound like a scrooge), but the score of The Nutcracker is so lovely, and while it's associated with the Holidays it isn't over-played or over-sung on the radio and in every last store starting Thanksgiving Day. 

Did you know that Tchaikovsky didn't really want to write The Nutcracker at all? Though he accepted the commission from Ivan Vsevolozhsky, it was a daily chore for him to work on it and he actually really detested the score. 

(I for one feel quite opposite about the outcome of the piece and am certainly glad he finished it.)

Well, our house now smells of pine and cinnamon and even mistletoe. It sparkles a bit with glitter, candles and white twinkle lights. The stockings are hung by our chimney with care and everything feels so cozy. Austin even turns the tree on if he beats us home; he knows seeing it as I pull in the driveway makes me happy.

I love this time of year.

I've been daydreaming a lot lately. Too much, probably.. I've got a ton of work to do and I can't really focus.

I've been trying to figure out what to get Alden for Christmas.
He was telling everyone that he was getting a Nintendo DS. Pfft. Not if I can help it.

""Alden,"" I said, ""A DS costs too much money.""
And he, in his know-it-all tone responds:
""Mom, the elves <i>make</i> them.""

SO, I went about telling him the truth in a non-direct sort of way; how they still cost money to make and he's a little young for a DS, etc etc.

In this daydreaming about what to do for Christmas (yes yes, late late late), I've been daydreaming about things I wish I could get, too.

Sadly, and so very girlie cliche of me, I wish I could get clothes. Lots of pretty, nice new clothes.

This lovely little cranberry dress from <a href=""http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/catalog/category.jsp?navAction=jump&navCount=7&id=CLOTHES"">Anthropologie</a href> would do the trick:

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/930114_060_b.jpg""></center>

And I'm adoring these cruelty-free Elegan heels from <a href=""http://www.veganchic.com/"">Vegan Chic</a href>:

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/eleganvegandressshoe_veganchic.jpg"" img size width=450 height=300></center>

I also wouldn't mind sitting around (in my cranberry dress and vegan shoes) on a bright day and doodling with a pack of smencils (which I discovered at <a href=""http://www.stubbypencilstudio.com/"">*this*</a href> perfectly cute, eco-friendly kid's art supply site).

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/smencils.jpg""></center>
<br>
On that bight day, after doodling with cherry and spearmint smencils (in my new outfit), I would get surprised by the vintage-looking images my new little Holga produced.

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/holga.jpg"" img size width=250 height=200""></center>

I'd end the day with a cup of April's tea and leafing through John James' incredible imagery compiled in one edition or another of a very large, hardback copy. 
Preferably used, and aged.. with that lovely ""old book"" smell.
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/birdsofamerica.jpg""></center>


Sounds perfect to me. If I were rich I'd buy the whole lot. But alas, I am not.. and will save daydreams for another day. 
When there is extra time to add more things to the list. 
Like... well I won't start. ;)

I've had this little girl done for a while now, but haven't made time to share her with you yet:

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/reindeer-girl_for-web.jpg"" img size width=550 height=340></center>
<br>
I really like her; especially her eyes. She's my second attempt at digitally painting one of my girls. (<a href=""http://mycandacejean.livejournal.com/48006.html"">Little red hat</a href> was my first.)

I know there is ""a thing"" with people putting antlers on their illustrated characters (<i>everybody</i> is doing it), and I've also wanted to do this for some time (I'm just constantly late in the game). I figured too tying the idea in with the holidays and hanging some ornaments would be a good idea. I'm sure I'll be back with more antlered beauties in the future; mixing animal and human traits has always interested me.

My friend Heather gave me this eraser years ago because she knew it suited me. I have yet to use it to erase anything.. I don't want it to go away. 
Eraser knows my catch phrase.
Eraser sums up perfectly how the last few weeks around here have been.

I was so busy I didn't ever even get to say how excited I was that I was invited to be a part of <a href=""http://www.patinamarket.com/"">Patina</a href> (thank you Nichole and Justin for having me!) or back to vend again with <a href=""http://www.thebeehivebazaar.com/index.html"">The Beehive Bazaar</a href>. I've been super busy trying to prepare product for both venues while at the same time trying to make time to hang out with Austin (I've been more of a hermit lately), take care of my Alden (who unfortunately got sick again!), and look after the creatures and house <i>after</i> long days at work. *WHEW*.

Now that both shows are over (and-- my fault-- my participation went unannounced, gah) I'm trying to refresh my inventory with some new things, and have many items stashed away in the depths of my art room just <i>waiting</i> for me to pull them out and finish them up. I have so many ideas I'm excited for! (I say that often, and funny: hardly get around to making them happen.)

A few of the projects I couldn't wait to make was a new batch of hair pins (all sold out; thank you!):

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/hair-pins1.jpg"" img size width=400 height=300></center>

And some lovely little brooches (I loved each and every last one):

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/brooches1.jpg"" img size width=400 height=300></center>

Again, I thank everyone for their support and help while I worked on these shows, and of course for everything people I've never even met did that made the shows successful for me. 

Before I prepare to get ready for whatever show comes next, I'll let you in on a few of those 'stashed away' creations that soon will be brought from hiding and finished (so says I!):

<dir>- Garnet and Snowdrop and a dark-eyed beauty<br>
- Wooden egg originals and tiny satin boxes<br>
- Secret admirer notes from curious messengers<br>
- 1956 classics with 500+ pages of buried surprises<br>
- An infamous jar represented in box form with a tiny bit of hope at the bottom <br>
- A highly anticipated dinner-date on a perfect, firefly filled night <br>
</dir>
Ah anticipation! I should wager against myself how much I can get done before the new year.
Be sure to come back and check on me!

I can't <i>believe</i> how fast time is flying. Before I know it I'll be scrambling to set up for my next show at the <a href=""http://thebeehivebazaar.com/index.html"">The Beehive Bazaar</a href>!

Well, I won't say how far past my goal date I went to finally get these cards completed, but now that I have a few pictures I'm a little happier about I thought I would share them with you.

<center><p style=""font-size:large;"">""The Nutcracker Suite""</p>
...a set of holiday cards...

My favorite one is Clara and the Prince. I also like how the Snowflakes came together, and I do like the Mouse King in his little mouse hat.

I've added sets to both my <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/candacejean"">Etsy</a href> and <a href=""http://candacejean.bigcartel.com/"">BigCartel</a href> shops. I plan to also have some at <a href=""http://www.patinamarket.com/"">Patina</a href>, an adorable little venue I've completely failed to mention, and some at the <a href=""http://thebeehivebazaar.com/index.html"">Beehive Bazaar</a href> as well. I hope people out there are late like I am and haven't yet bought Christmas cards!

Happy Friday the 13th!

I couldn't help myself, and for the fear of my brains exploding took a personal day. I didn't go to work, I shut myself in my room with the bright sunlight coming in and I was <i>productive</i>. It felt SO nice to have the only noise here be exactly the music I wanted to listen to. A lively mix that is happy, and as soft background sounds it inspired my creativity. 

With zero interruptions I drew and colored, colored and drew, and I got one little guy all the way finished up. He's part of the Christmas cards I mentioned on Wednesday that I am so excited about. I'm anxious about getting the rest of the set completed ASAP-- not only because I've been wanting to tackle this idea for months now, but because I'm terribly behind! Everyone else had their Christmas stuff out weeks ago. Sigh. 

Well, here is a squeak-- err-- sneak peek:

A Happy 11-11 to everyone that knows what I'm talking about, and for the rest of you.. perhaps you should know that I have a ""curse"" that I've learned to just-- well, <i>embrace</i>, I guess you could say.

I've been tired lately, an early-onset of the cold, dark weather 'sighs'. But today was a better day. 

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/savethescruboak.jpg"" img size width=350 height=375></center>

I remember years ago driving with my grandparents through a canyon, when my grandma suddenly screamed ""LES! I saw an acorn! PULL OVER!"" 

How she saw one little acorn on that forest floor with us bouncing down that windy, dusty road the way we were, I will never know.. but she hopped out of the truck and ran back to get it. She came back with a couple of acorns, a small twig, and an ear-to-ear grin. My grandpa let her bring home the mountain findings and she planted them. 

I think it was right then that I grew my love for little mountain scrub-oak.

My dad knows I've been wanting some for my yard, but couldn't afford the potted ones found only at expensive landscape suppliers. I think he was really pleased to call me at work with the following news:

He was on an east-side job and found a little baby scrub oak sapling that, in the midst of some serious excavating and construction, was uprooted. He told me he buried the root again off to the side in order to keep it moist and help avoid shock, so once I left work Alden and I drove up to rescue it. Cute tiny little thing... hardly a foot tall. Apparently it lost its last autumn leaf during the upheaval; its last bit of true 'scrub-oak identity'.

I put it in a pot and plan to let it winter over in the garage. I hope it survives and comes back in the spring. 

Alden and I then went to the store for a few things, where we ended up in checkout lane 11, purchased eleven things, and the cashier even let Alden help her ""scan the stripes"". I love Harmons.

And as far as that announcement my entry title advertised... I have Christmas card sets on the way! I am so far behind, but I am eagerly trying to finish these up and have them available soon. I am so excited about the idea behind them too, and really can't wait to see them done. Please stay tuned!

Literally every living creature in here besides myself is male. Minus the plants.

I'm feeling like I need a little more estrogen in this place. 
I adore all my boys, but I think I wouldn't mind being ""mothered"" for a change, for a few days anyway.

PS.. Can I ask when the vacation is? I feel like I've been at the office for too many days straight. I'd love to go see someplace warm and green. I haven't done that in a <i>long</i> time.

I am continually surprised at how many nice people I meet while doing local shows. Everyone is always so friendly!
The Piper and Chloe show went really well; I greatly appreciate everyone's support and can't say thanks enough!

I have always wanted to take a book for people to sign their email addresses inside and just never did it until now. WOW what a response! I had more people join my mailing list than I originally thought I would. And that all by itself is <i>very</i> flattering. 

This show snuck up on me as well. I think all shows will do that-- just by default. Never enough time to plan, never enough time to finish and be fully prepared. And while some evenings were spent down in the art room (versus just at night), Alden hung out with me and helped me get ready. He sees me making and packaging multiple prints of the same piece, and so, being a sweetheart, made me a few all by himself:
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/redhatgirlcluster.jpg"" img size width=700 height=300></center>

He was in a hurry because it was his bedtime, and as he ran off to get his pajamas on he yelled over his shoulder: ""you can sell the originals if you want."" Haha. They are ""the red hat girl, but with a bluebird on her head, for the art show!"" he told me. (How cute!)

One drawback to doing these local shows is that I can usually only take myself. My trunk hardly allows room to fit anything, and because I have a coupe I can't fit much more in the back... so I usually set up and take down solo due to all of my seats being filled with <i>stuff</i>. This time I was lucky though and able to bring Alden along for take-down. He was such a big help, so we stopped at a gas station for treats before the drive home. He got skittles and a water bottle. Me, a cherry pepsi. We mixed it up with some Elvis, a little Journey, Georgia Gibbs, The Monkeys, The Beatles, and of course The Beach Boys. I can't contain myself when Alden sings along; especially to ""Help Me Rhonda"". 
OH, and let's not forget Uptown Girl. 
No no, the Billy Joel version. 
Oh yes. 
It was a party.

Besides a good show the last few weeks have also brought a few other nice things:

*Carrie hanging out with Alden so Austin and I could go on a date; we saw Bright Star. <i>Sad</i>, but I liked the movie.
*A mini Wolverine, a 40's moviestar, and a 'poor sport' met an adorable flapper for a Halloween dinner
*Cups of warm, vegan hot chocolates cooked stove-top, complete with brown sugar and whip
*The Yankees won the series (most nights, Alden, Austin and I wrapped up in blankets and watched the games together)
*Planted a few more bulbs for some springtime surprises
*And... more things I'm sure. I've had the fidgets about finishing a series of small pieces before it gets too late in the season, and I've actually started adding color to one today... so I'm off to do that. 

More later!

I've never done a <a href=""http://piperandchloe.blogspot.com/"">""Piper & Chloe""</a href> show before, so I'm excited to have been included and can't wait to give it a shot. I've heard nothing but good things about it!

The show takes place up north, in Farmington for those who live in Utah.

I sat down in my art room some time ago with this image in my head, and decided that I would try to fully illustrate the portrait digitally rather than my traditional way. So, I did.. and I'm happy with the way she came out. 

<br><center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/redhatgirl.gif""></center>

I used Photoshop completely. And of course my trusty Wacom that Austin got me for Christmas two years ago. I've never painted a portrait that way, and couldn't wait until the little cards I outsourced came back from the printers. I like how her hat and bow are more of a design element than fully rendered, and want to incorporate more of that into my work on future pieces.

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/redhattags3.jpg"" img size width=400 height=400></center>

I've turned these little cards into multi-purpose tags; sets will be available in packs of 12 (non-punched and no string), and also sets of 8 tags, each on a 14 inch strand of black+white baker's twine. 

I figured each set could be used in different ways and the little cards could act as miniature notes, gift tags or whatever else people could think up. 


<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/redhattags1.jpg"" img size width=400 height=330></center>

I received a message that Graeme has selected my print for his daily ""Vote Etsy"" contest, and I'm so flattered. There are only three pieces to pick from; how cool is it that I made the cut? 
Thanks Graeme!

The contest ends today, so if you make it here on TUESDAY THE 27TH and wouldn't mind clicking your mouse a few times, I would sure appreciate the votes.

I started this poor little girl immediately after I started Charlie, and that piece has been done for a while now. Years maybe. In the meanwhile this bluebirds girl has been waiting and waiting while I get revved up about another new idea and then another, leaving her high on a shelf for another day and often forgotten about.

Austin though, remembered her more often than I did and brought her up multiple times. ""Finish up your bluebirds girl"", he would say, and ""why don't you work on the blonde one? She's almost done,"" so, <i>finally</i>, I did. 
At the rate I was going, I really don't know if I would have ever finished her if Austin hadn't of kept me in check.

So, here she is.. ""Brie and the bluebirds"", back from the photographer's studio and ready in print form:

This last week or so, like normal, has been busy.

- Alden lost his first tooth! (He got ""a whole dollar"" from the tooth fairy, and then two days later lost his second tooth. Pulled them both out on his own. Hah.)

- Cleared out all of the annuals that have finished their season in my flower bed, and made room to plant black tulip, king daffodil, and tiny little muscari bulbs. Alden helped so much! We'll put in the pink crocus on another clear day. I can't wait for them to come up next spring!

- More magnets and ""Taken by Bats"" prints have made their way to Lounge Salon for resale.

- Giant harvest vegetable and not-chicken pot pie baked up for dinner
  (provided yummy leftovers for lunch at work for three days!)

- Working on Este Pizzeria menu board layouts 
 (taking over for the beer supplier who seems to be having trouble getting it ""just right"")

- Finishing up a few custom orders on <a href=""www.candacejean.etsy.com"">""the girls""</a href> side of my shops (thank you for your requests!)

- Gearing up for another show.. more details to follow

- Saw 'Where the Wild Things Are'
  (<i>Not</i> a family-friendly feel good kid-type movie like I was expecting. As Austin put it, the trailer was better than the film. It was creative, and I understand where they were going with it, but I assumed it was made for kids and a child is not going to catch on to what Max is experiencing, learning. Plus, for some reason.. keeping bits of the original story text was slightly embarrassing. It felt forced in to the movie. For being only and hour and thirty-four minutes long, it dragged and dragged. An hour and thirty minutes of it was full of hostility, depression and tension, and the only four silent minutes of the film was the normal, comforting part. I'm sad I took Alden to it. I feel like it left a bad taste in his mouth for the classic story.)

- Baked a batch of chocolate chip cookies (while Alden stood by, licking the beaters, of course)

- Took a (finally) finished piece to a local print and photography studio for reproduction (will be available in the shop soon!)

- Ryan (Austin's brother) went back to San Diego today. He spent about two weeks with us here again, guest-spotting at Goodtimes. I fully plan to mention his arrival when he actually arrives next time, rather than at his departure, so you locals can see his work and schedule an appointment. He's really a great artist.

- Received an email today that I've been included in a treasury again; this time a lovely, haunting, right-in-time-for-Halloween bats-themed treasury:

Well, whew! More just keeps coming.. I'll be back!

Art Market went really well; I'm thankful to have been invited to participate. Carrie came over and stayed up late with me, helping me package last-minute things (I really need to not let shows sneak up on me anymore!). Alden helped label some items with prices as well, and I was pleasantly surprised at how successful the show was for me seeing as it was only one day. Thanks again to everyone for your support!

After setting up for the show on Saturday Alden, Austin and I hit the road for an afternoon in Park City. We visited the outlets for a while, picked up some new Vans for Alden, then stopped for an early dinner at Whole Foods. I really love being in Park City, <i>especially</i> in autumn. We went back down to clean up the show and spent a quiet evening at home. 
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/stickyrolls_roundcorners.gif"" img size width=400 height=300></center>

Sunday morning I made warm, vegan sticky rolls with a sweet, cinnamon glaze. They are so suiting for this Octoberish weather! 

Poor little Alden, though.. had a really rough night with an upset stomach and fever, so he never got to enjoy any. He had another rough night on Sunday, so I stayed home to doctor him up on Monday. I dropped off a note and his homework to school while he slept at home, and once I got back Austin went to work and I resumed ""taking guard"". I sat outside Alden's bedroom and waited. He continued to sleep, so I went and pulled my old hardback copy of Heidi off my nightstand and read. Soon I dozed off (when Alden has a rough night I do, too), and woke up not much later to Alden stirring. He was uncomfortable from his fever.

Off and on Alden was fine and then felt lousy.. off and on as his medicine kicked in and then tapered away. I felt so bad for him, but he was being so polite and sweet during the whole ordeal. We even finished his 'Flip' homework together. 
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/fliphomework1.jpg"" img size width=350 height=450> <img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/fliphomework2.jpg"" img size width=350 height=450></center>

(Flip is a little frog that each child in his class gets to take care of for one week. You make a journal entry after the week is over of ""everything you and Flip did"", and turn the book over to the next child for their turn with Flip. Alden was <i>so</i> excited for his turn.)

Luckily, by the end of today Alden was doing much better and still got to go to his Halloween party with Cabrielle. While he was out painting pumpkins and making trick-or-treat bags, Austin and I went to see ""Zombieland"" with my dad and brother. It wasn't a total disappointment; I laughed quite a bit actually.

<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/withflip_bikeride.jpg"" img size width=400 height=300></center>

I was really worried about Alden over the weekend, being as sick as he was. Especially after another H1N1 news spot on cable. 
But, he's back to being his adorable, funny, sweet little self, and we hope to keep it that way for a <i>long</i> time.

I've mentioned it before, but this summer's <a href=""http://www.craftlakecity.com/home"">Craft Lake City</a href> opened up a whole bunch of new opportunities for me. Within a day or so of that show ending, I received multiple emails inviting me to participate in other local art and craft markets. I've been so grateful for those invitations!

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/artmarketheader.gif"" img size width=575 height=116></center>


The next show I am participating in is <a href=""http://utahartmarket.com/gallery.html"">Art Market</a href>. The show is one day only; <b>this Saturday, October the 10th</b>. I won't physically be there, but my booth (and lots of other neat ones) will be from about 10 am (I think?) until 6 in the evening, at the Sugar House rose garden pavillion. (You can click <a href=""http://utahartmarket.com/events2.html"">*here*</a href> for more information.)

Thank you to Nanette for having me along, and for including two of my pieces (Abigail necklace and the Big Apple) for Art Market's ""preview gallery""! 

If any of you Utah locals can make it, you should check this show out. I've heard many a great things...

<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/takenbybats_forwebsnip.jpg"" img size width=500 height=425></center>

I figured there was no better time to finish it up than the Halloween month of October.
I used about every medium I have available in order to finish this one, except digital, and I'm really very happy with the way it turned out. And the number of bats? Haha.. it was absolutely, 100% <i>not</i> pre-planned. I'm just stuck with the eleven thing.

I woke up Saturday morning and rather than going down to my art room to paint like I planned, I spontaneously got on my computer and started compiling pieces together for website pages. 
<br>
<center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/screenshot.jpg"" img size width=600 height=425></center>

Believe it or not, by late Saturday afternoon I had up a completely new site with multiple pages. 

Believe it because, well.. it still isn't complete and certainly isn't anything fancy. It's a pretty simplistic cluster of pages that were obviously tossed quickly together. 

And don't believe it because.. haha.. html and I do <i>not</i> get along.
In fact, I spent all of today ironing out kinks and straightening bugs. There are still gallery ""buttons"" that don't function due to the fact that I don't actually have a gallery, and because the whole thing is sliced, I doubt an internet search will retrieve anything linking back to my new site. Which, if someone wanted to find my work, is not a good thing. 

And poor Austin, patiently sat outside my art room for the last two days watching the Yankees game, waiting for me to finish nerding out. 

I suppose it's good that I randomly decided to try and tackle my site while Alden spent the weekend with his dad; I hardly came out of my room for lunch. BUT-- at least it's closer to something I'm happy with, offers a few more links and a bit more information, and it's <i>done</i>.

The weather here--with its big, black rolling clouds-- seems it may put a damper on gallery stroll tonight. 
But, it's still warm and the air is calm, and it may not rain at all. 

A little salon downtown called Lounge recently started participating in gallery stroll. Last month, in fact, was their first night open for the stroll. And, lucky me, I was invited to participate. 

(<a href=""http://www.craftlakecity.com/home"">Craft Lake</a href> not only provided me the opportunity to meet tons of very friendly people, but I was presented with a handful of business cards and requests for custom orders, as well as invitations to vend in a bunch of different shows and various wholesale/consignment arrangements. This is how I met Erin.)

Erin manages (owns?) Lounge, and she introduced herself to me in my booth at Craft Lake. She asked if I would want to sell my art in her little boutique that she set up in Lounge, and of course I was thrilled and very interested. 

So, if you go strolling, you can now find candacejean stuff at Lounge (as well as a bunch of other neat handmade things). 
It's a cute little salon/spa..

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/lounge5.jpg"" img size width=275 height=425></center>

..and everyone there is really nice. I like how Erin stuck my magnets up on the decorative chicken wire that's hung on the boutique walls. 
You should go and see! <i>(*Edit: Lounge is located on 451 East and Broadway downtown. Thanks for reminding me, Trevor.*)</i>

(And don't forget about the Oh Sweet Sadie show.. tonight was the 'official' opening and tomorrow is the last day. Live in Salt Lake? Check it out!)

This afternoon I drove out to set up my space for the 'Oh Sweet Sadie' show. It seems like it's going to be <i>big</i>; the space they are holding it in is pretty gigantic, and there were all sorts of vendors with very professional displays. I was feeling a little embarrassed of mine; a simple folding table with a bedsheet covering and not much to set on top. BUT-- I do have some secret ideas of how I want mine to look for Art Market (coming next month) and hopefully the Beehive Bazaar in December. I just didn't have the time to better enhance booth asthetics for this show, and there is only so much you can pack in a coupe.

Off topic completely-- guess what <i>I</i> got to do this evening?
Bookorders.
I was <i>so</i> excited; I used to love bookorders when I was in school and I often find myself missing them even now. There is just something about the thin, newsprint catalog, checking those boxes, and then having your teacher call you up to get your package once all the books arrive.
Alden put a star next to the books he wanted, and once we looked over the catalog front-to-back and bottom-to-top five times over, narrowed it down to a decent handful. I was even happier to see awesome classics!
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/giving_tree-1.jpg"" img size width=210 height=275 style=""border: 4px white solid;""> <img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/il_fullxfull_51365353.jpg"" img size width=215 height=275 style=""border: 4px white solid;""></center>

Alden seemed really excited about the whole idea too.

And in another swift change of subject.. I finally got a new phone.
(My old one flatlined about three days ago, and I've been without since.) 
I hate picking phones. I hate <i>switching</i> phones. They stick you in a contract for two years, so you are stuck with this little device that is outdated once you leave the store. You get used to the way it works, and so once it comes time for a new phone you have to re-learn everything, nothing is as it should be, it does things you don't want it to and won't do what you want, and the whole ordeal just makes you grumpy. 
At least it always has to me. I don't know why.

But <i>this</i> phone.. this phone so far is swell.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/t-mobilemytouch.jpg""></center><br>
It's the MyTouch from Google and T-mobile. I was considering an iphone, but I love having my '5 faves', and the rest of my family is with this carrier so I can talk to them for free. This phone <i>will</i> send and receive picture texts also. I've heard the iphones still can't. 

I like the size of the phone, I like how the touch-screen feels, I like the interface and ability to download applications, I even like the package it comes in. Plus, the apps are very cool. Like Pandora.

So there is all that. 

And in sum, taking it back to art, I have some tiny little cuties in production now at the printers that I'm very happy about. They should be on my front porch within a week, and very soon after posted here and in the shops. To be continued!

Alden went to be with his dad for a few days, so Austin and I took the Labor Day weekend to touch base with our ""Uh-mehr-eh-kun"" roots.
We wandered way out into the desert with Jordan and Johanna to shoot guns. 
Yup. 
Just hang out.. and... shoot beer bottles with guns. 
Can't imagine me doing it? Well.. haha.. my whole family and Carrie all said the same thing. But lookit:

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/candace_shotgun.jpg"" img size width=435 height=350></center>

A <i>shotgun</i> even, ha! Pretty much as long as I am tall, and darn near kicked me back onto my butt in the desert dust after each shot.
<br>
Austin, Jordan and Johanna would shoot bottles out of the air after someone tossed one up. 
Well, try to anyway. Jordan was successful. (I didn't even bother trying.)

<br>
And <i>then</i> we got out the little black Glocks. 
You know, I really used to <i>hate</i> guns, and they still make me incredibly nervous.. and I don't think I'm interested in ever owning a gun.. but something about these Glocks.. dunno. They command respect. And yes, though I've hated guns, I still have always admired the black Glock.

(Caught the shell in that last frame.)
And those Glocks and I.. we got along well. 

Here am I, standing there in all of my 5'2"" unassuming, straight-faced timid nature..
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/candace_glock2.jpg"" img size width=470 height=350></center>
<br>
..but they told my family I was ""a better shot than everyone"". 

I earned the nickname ""Killer"" that day.

Ah yes.. I took the heads off each bottle; one after the other, all in a row...with the base still standing.
<br><center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/brokenneck.jpg"" img size width=393 height=300></center>

And here is pizza box with my bragging rights. 
<br><center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/braggingrights.jpg"" img size width=393 height=300></center>
<br>
At the end of the day we stopped on the way out of the desert and visited my family. They were at Five Mile riding four-wheelers, so to top off our (insert rough, southern trucker voice) ''rugged, man-made'' Labor Day, we rode around on four-wheelers, too.

It was a good, laughable day.

I tend to get attached to each piece of art I complete and end up not wanting to let them go. But, I've decided that I'll be ok parting ways with my ""Springtime"" original. It needs a good home to be displayed in, versus spending it's days zipped up in a portfolio.
<center><br>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/Springtime1.jpg"" img size width=430 height=330""></center>
<br>
I completed the piece on soft bristol stock measuring 11x14 inches with ink and watercolor. I was daydreaming one February afternoon last year about the soft, antiqued tones that spring will soon rise with from the grays of winter, and the idea for this piece popped into my head.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/Springtime2.jpg"" img size width=430 height=330""></center>
<br>
It is signed and dated the month of completion, and will come with a certificate of authenticity. I decided that my Etsy shop has a larger audience at this point (versus my BigCartel), so I've listed her there.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/Springtime3.jpg"" img size width=430 height=330""></center>
<br>
I've also discontinued this piece, and while some open edition prints have been set aside to sell at local shows, I have only about six left that will be available online.

I've been invited to participate in a few more shows before the year ends, so as I try to prepare for them I draw when I can. 
Here are a few sketches from a piece in progress:
<br>

<br>
A chimney swift and a little boy. I know you are wondering why I've got him just standing there with his arm in the air, but he is going to be holding the swift's shoulder. I'm messy when I work; I always drag my hand through the pieces as I lay out a pencil drawing so the whole thing ends up black. I knew I'd have a lot of re-working to do on both of these characters, so I drew them separately in hopes of preserving some detail and planned on knitting them together once I was ready to lay out the painting.
I'm thinking now I'll have to move the boy's feet some so it doesn't look like he's still standing about once I have him on the swift. 
Anyway. There you have it... ""On Swift Wings"" parts one and two.. more coming soon (I hope!)

Alden is zoned to go to a different elementary school, but I think its ghetto. It looks old and dark and scrappy. Plus the test scores aren't so good, and the student-to-teacher ratio is poor.. so I got him into a school outside of our boundaries. Ha!
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/firstdayofschool7-1.jpg""></center>
<br>
It wasn't easy, I'll tell you what. We aren't even in the <i>district</i> we're zoned for, but I pulled some moves and spoke with the principal. Got him the last available spot in Kindergarten.

We went back-to-school-shopping over the weekend and got some new clothes, as well as the norm... pencils, erasers... sweet baseball notebook, etc.
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/firstdayofschool6.jpg""></center>
<br>
I've back-to-school shopped a million times for my own self (even while <i>not</i> in school-- I just love getting paper and pencils and crayons for cheap!), but I've never done it for anyone else. Was fun!

We went to back-to-school night and found his nametag frog, met the teacher, toured the school (its nice!), ate some snowcones...

..and today I took him for his first day of school. I have to admit, I got a little emotional when I started packing his backpack. I can't believe he's starting public school already, and I know that from now on time will <i>fly</i> and he's going to be in high school before I know it. And sassing off. And getting girlfriends. Ah!
Seems like yesterday he was kicking me in the ribs from inside my tummy.
<br><center>

Hooray for you, Alden! Gosh I'm proud. I love you!!

I finally set up a make-shift shop on Big Cartel, so now there is no need for you to log in to Etsy to make a purchase. I plan to expand it and make it a little better in the future, but for now it works.

You can find it <a href=http://candacejean.bigcartel.com/>here</a href>.

I've added a few new items both to Big Cartel and to Etsy that I haven't mentioned yet here, so I'll start now:

First: Way cool raven decals. 
<center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/raven-decal2_forweb.jpg"" img size width=400 height=400></center>
<br>
I went through a printing company to have them professionally silk-screened onto clear vinyl. They are six inch circle stickers, and suitable for outdoor use. They work awesome for car windows!
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/ravendecal1.jpg"" img size width=400 height=320></center>

Next, I made a bunch of really great magnets for Craft Lake. They sold out completely, so while a few have been uploaded to Big Cartel, I plan on putting them up on <a href=""http://candacejean.etsy.com/"">Etsy</a href> and available in a few more options as soon as I get another batch completed.
<br><center>

<br>

Finally, I made bookmark sets for Craft Lake as well. They also sold out, but I have another small bundle of them  started and ready to go. These were outsourced as well and professionally offset-printed; currently available in both shops.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/bookmarks1.jpg"" img size width=400 height=320></center>

One of the bookmarks features a new print (also currently available in both shops) that I also haven't announced here (caught up on entries? Pah!), but plan to write about next time.

That's that for now.. I'm off to clean up the art room. Good day!

We got a cat.
<br>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/my-shoes--cat_curtains.jpg"" img size width=500 height=390>
<br>
He's the new family member I mentioned previously. A little blue-point Persian. 
Or, rather..  a Himalayan, to be 'politically correct' I suppose.
<br>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/cat-nap.jpg"" img size width=375 height=290"">
<br></center>
He's definitely a ""daddy's boy"". Austin wrapped the kitty up in his shirt on the drive home, and stayed up late with him while the cat figured out where he was the first night here. The next day when we were home from work, the kitty tailed Austin <i>everywhere</i>, and if Austin happened to get out of his sight the cat would start to cry. He'd wail so much his stupid eyes would well up with tears; I mean it. It was an adorably frustrating and cutely pathetic stunt.. crying like that.
He's warmed up to Alden and I by now though, and he does play very well with Alden. 

He's still not at all good at holding still for pretty pictures though.
<br><center> 
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/blurry-cat.jpg"" img size width=290 height=375>

{See what I mean.}

I only got the close-up above because I snuck up on him during a cat nap.

Here are some low-res iphone snapshots Austin and I managed to take:

<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/catiphone1.jpg"" img size width=250 height=340 style=""border: 8px white solid;""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/iphonecat2.jpg"" img size width=250 height=340 style=""border: 8px white solid;"">
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/iphonecat3.jpg"" img size width=250 height=340 style=""border: 8px white solid;""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/iphonecat4.jpg"" img size width=250 height=340 style=""border: 8px white solid;"">
</center>
Looking like a fluffy bunny next to his mouse toy, snuggling on Austin (a usual occurrence), faux-hawk after a bath (boy was he <i>mad!</i>), and putting on his big eyes when it comes time for ""The Late Night Winston Show"". (He goes crazy. You should see it.)

And.. <i>maybe</i> Winston. I've been referring to him as 'Cat' and 'Kitty' here because anything else we call him sounds funny and doesn't seem to fit. We can't seem to pick a suitable name. Justin came up with Winston... stuffy, too-good, non-sociable Winston. An 'old-man' name.. old money even. Sounds like a Persian's m.o. 

Well, there you have it. (I'm feeling caught up on entries!) Any name suggestions for this little guy??

While I was hoping to round up my sketch of Mary Lennox to share with you here, she's gone missing from the move four months ago! I am hoping she will turn up soon; I'd love to finish her portrait and place her in the white vintage frame that Carrie bought for me.

In the meanwhile, I'll share with you how my garden grows:

<br>
Rose of Sharon, lovely vibrant hibiscus blooms every day, the scent of corsican mint... candy-colored hollyhock blossoms and adorable pink balloon flowers!
Never you mind the construction zone behind Alden's hummingbird feeder, and though the last image is a bit scrappy that little tree will soon fill out. I have <i>always</i> wanted a weeping blue cedar atlas pine, and while Austin doesn't like them at <i>all</i>, especially for the front yard, he let me get one anyway. We planted it just recently, and so far it's doing well. I love bringing home favorites and wishing them well out in my yard, letting them be to grow and prosper and see them succeed!

Last weekend we piled on Austin's Vino and scooted a quarter of the way up the block to a park that is right on our street. While the boys practiced fielding grounders and carried on conversations like the following:

""This is the heater. I <i>dare</i> you to hit it,""
""What, you think you're better than me?""
""I <i>know</i> I am,""
""Prove it!""

.. I gathered up pretty little pieces of nature and put them in my notebook.

I try to stay away from thrift stores anymore; to be good and not bring home a bunch of random things. 
BUT-- I happened across some free time after work one day a couple of weeks ago and suddenly found myself parking in the lot of a local shop downtown.. so I meandered inside.

Naturally, on the one day I go, they have <i>so</i> much good stuff I couldn't carry it all in my arms and a nice gentleman brought me a cart as I started dropping everything.
(No.. that's bad. It's better that they don't have anything.)

But look what I found!
<br>
A cute old cup to put new paintbrushes in. Foxgloves? Delphinium? Awesome!

<br>
An incredible old silver jewelry box; <i>real</i> silver and with a blood red velvet lining inside. So intricately detailed!

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/jewelry-box.jpg"" img size width=400 height=290></center>

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/kitty-bowls.jpg"" img size width=400 height=290></center>

A whole slew of great hardcover books..

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/shlewoldbooks.jpg"" img size width=400 height=300></center>

<br>
Including this lovely, thick book entirely about butterflies. Just butterflies!

(<i>That</i> will definitely come in handy for future art projects. And I am very excited about the 'Exploring Nature with Your Child' book!)

<br>
And finally, this incredible old polaroid camera. It's <i>big</i>. I've always wanted one of these!

Just a quick and simple post to say how wonderful the show went. Austin stayed up late with me the night before finishing packaging all sorts of things, and Carrie came over early the day of and loaded <i>her</i> car with all of my stuff and then sat with me all day.. and a bunch of friends stopped in to show support and say hello during the event. It was so nice!

I was on the receiving end of a tidal wave of encouragement and kind words, and it meant so much to me. I really hope to dedicate a bit more time to my online shop and paint more often than I do; I really am flattered that people enjoy my stuff and I honestly want to make more for them to pick from. New stuff for them to see. Everyone I came in contact with the day of the event was incredibly kind, and my face ended up hurting mid-show from smiling so much. I had a blast. Never have I had such a motivational and successful show; so thank you to everyone that played a part!

Holy smokes have I been behind! Like.. weeks and <i>weeks</i> behind.

Ryan came for a 14 day visit and Alden started his late summer season (after an awesome early summer season) of t-ball, <i>annnnd</i> we've added a new addition to the family. Cough. More on that later; until then... suspense!

I've been motivated and non-motivated, battling the norm, every-day inconveniences and I admit: also have been given plenty of free time (but didn't always take advantage of it) to prepare for an upcoming show : 
<center><a href=""http://www.craftlakecity.com/"">Craft Lake City</a href>.</center> 

After months of anticipating the news on accepted vendors post a pretty serious application process, I was thrilled to receive this email:

<i>""...We had over 120 submissions from artists across the Wasatch Front and have narrowed our selection to 60 participants. SLUG Magazine brought in five judges to make the difficult decision of determining which artists would showcase at the festival, and we feel the outcome has a great balance of all categories and really represents the innovative and creative artists in this region. Congratulations! You have been selected to participate in the first annual Craft Lake City Alternative Arts & Crafts Festival!""...</i>

Hooray! 

So while I'm thrilled to be a part of this and hope I can do it again next summer, I've bitten off a lot in trying to get ready. I do this thing I've mentioned a million times, where I get all excited about new neat things and stray from project to project. It's a bad habit. BUT-- I have two all-new prints ready for this show that are of limited edition. I'll have more necklaces, plenty of cards, neat stickers, magnets and bookmark packs. Come and visit Carrie and I at my booth!

I uh... I adopted some popples. 
Yeah... popples. 
Inside-outable furry neon creatures from the eighties. 
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/popples2.jpg"" img size width=390 height=300></center>
<br>
Did you guys ever have these when you were little?
I did. And I loved mine. Somewhere during childhood the one I had disappeared..
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/popples3.jpg"" img size width=390 height=300></center>
<br>
From what I discovered they started making popples again. Pfft. I wanted the real deal, and stumbled across these three on ebay. Straight from 1986. And so cute!
I was hoping they would arrive while Alden was home, but he's gone to see his dad. I may have been secretely wanting to instill my love of them into Alden and encourage him to like them as much as me. Ha.
When I opened the package and saw their mismatched little bodies I got smashed in the face with a million memories of being little; it was so surreal. The popples look just like I remember they always did. Only difference is they're much smaller now that I'm big. Well, bigger. 
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/popples1.jpg"" img size width=390 height=300></center>
<br>
When Austin sees this post he's gonna say ""why the heck do you need popples?"" and I'll say ""because they're stupidly cute and they make me happy and perhaps because I'm getting older I need to surround myself with childhood memorabilia for some sort of strange psychological stabilization, like a quarter (versus mid) life crisis only very mild? Cough."" 
Then he will say to me ""too much stuff"" in somewhat of a discouraged tone, and I'll agree with a ""yeah..."" sigh...
And then maybe I'll try to show him how awesome the one little popple is because she still has her original swing tag; the front says 'what is small, purple and catches flies?' and the back answeres 'Pretty Bit Popple when she plays center field!'.. and Austin will probably just shake his head. He's a minimalist.

Anyway. They are way cute, and I've already started applying my bad habit of anthropomorphism. Little inanimate <i>toys</i> are like a handful of kittens. Pah.

<br>
My house is <i>covered</i> in paper airplanes. 
Somebody here makes new ones every... single... day. <i>Multiple</i> new ones. Usually out of homework. 
His name is Alden.
<br>
<br>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/andhisplane.jpg"" img size width=375 height=505></center>
<br>
<br>
It's fun to see all his different techniques as he trial-and-error folds the various planes. He also tests all my different papers; drawing, text, cover, cardstock.. and he's pretty fast. He whips those things up right quick. 
Sometimes during dinner at restaurants, too. He knows he can get teeny boomerang planes from my little notepads.

And speaking of going out to dinner... 

We went to Bombay not long ago. It's a very nice restaurant with ethnic feel and Indian cuisine. Many of the waiters wear what look like to me (though I don't know anything about them) Sikh turbans. 
After our waiter (who was wearing a turban) took our order, Alden asked in all honest curiosity (but a bit too loudly): ""Is he a genie?""

And again, at Vertical restaurant, when three very <i>large</i> men passed our table on their way out, Alden stated matter-of-factly: ""Um, I just saw three guys who don't really exercise.""

And a last one for the Alden quote book:
I was upstairs baking in the kitchen with Alden's help. Ryan was in town and in the basement with Austin. Though I'm sure they could smell it and hear my mixer going, I thought taking down a plate of warm cookies would be a nice surprise. 
Once the cookies went in to the oven Alden wandered downstairs. As soon as he was there, Austin asked:
""Hey Alden, what's your mom making?""
Alden, with enthusiastic excitement replied ""cookies!""
Then his little brow furrowed a bit... he scrunched his nose... and in a sad tone continued.
""Wait.. it's a surprise. I'm not supposed to tell you. <i>Why</i> did she tell me?!"" Then slumped upstairs seeming a bit defeated.
""Mom,"" he said, ""I accidently told Austin about the cookies.""
""Aw honey, how come?""
""I really don't know.""

We all had a pretty good laugh.

When we first moved in this spring Austin and I went and picked out a full, well-rounded little Japanese maple tree for our new house. It was the 'red dragon' strain; a lace-leafed ornamental dwarf, and I love it. I have always wanted one.

We decided to plant it to the side of our garage. This required digging up what was already planted there:
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/maplebed_before.jpg"" img size width=450 height=335></center>
A neglected little bed with wild seedlings, milkweed, and a mystery shrub. I definitely had my work cut out for me. 

I decided to make the beds symmetrical, since there were two, one on either side of the garage... so this meant going back for another red maple. As it was now late in the season, there was one little red dragon left; and he was <i>small</i>. Alden loved it though and wanted to bring it home anyway, and we figured the little tree would fill out in due time.

We then went to a rock yard where Alden and I gathered up some very pretty black beach pebbles..
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/alden_beachpebbles.jpg"" img size width=325 height=450>
</center>

..and blanketed both maple beds with them. 

<br><center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/alden-in-the-maple-beds.jpg"" img size width=450 height=335></center>

500 pounds of beach pebbles later, and with a touch of chartreuse Irish moss, the trees were planted and the beds complete.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/maplebed_after.jpg"" img size width=325 height=450></center>

Now we have two little red dragons standing guard in front of our garage.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/maplebed_after2.jpg"" img size width=450 height=325></center>

It was a <i>lot</i> of work. Hauling all that stone, bringing in good mulch, and digging out the rocky clay of the old beds wasn't easy, but I really like the way they turned out.

We finished them quite a while ago... more catch-up-journal-archiving to come!

The month of June holds the first day of summer. Our month of June held a few firsts in our new house, and not to mention a few repeats... and I've been feeling like this summer will be <i>awesome</i>.

I was working out in the front flower bed one Saturday morning, and I could hear a bird <i>purring</i>. Yes, purring.. over my right shoulder, behind me in the bushes. It was a quail for sure, but making the strangest of noises. 

I went over to see what was going on, and there were two quail chicks in the gutter. The mother and father were up near the sidewalk in the bushes, calling down to the babies, who were much too small to climb up themselves.

I lifted one and placed him in the bushes, and after Austin snapped a few quick pictures I put the second little guy back with his family.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/quail-chick.jpg"" img size width=400 height=300></center>
<br>
That evening I was doing the dishes and just outside the window I could see the quail family relocating across the open lot next to us; Mother running first, Father pulling up the rear... <i>eleven</i> babies darting along in the middle. Austin said they ""had enough kids to spare; you should have kept one"". I told him not to say that, because I really did want to. I <i>love</i> quail.

Two days later I went into my art room and could hear a peeping through my open window. A quail chick had fallen in to the  window well. I went outside, jumped down in and scooped him up. We went for a little walk around the house, the lot next door, the trees across the street... I couldn't find any other quail that could have been looking for him. In a hurry to make my orthodontist appointment, I put him in a box with shavings and placed a heat lamp over him until I got home. I didn't want the neighborhood cats to get him.

Austin said it was that same 'eleventh chick' come back for me; sought me out to be my own little bird. That's about when I started getting attached. 

I picked up some poultry starter feed at a farmer's supply store on the way home and placed it in the box with the chick. There are so many cats wandering near here the little guy would never stand a chance on his own, so I didn't want to just put him out in the dirt and expect him to make it. So, we sat on the lawn for a good half-hour; me assuming the chick's little peeps and chirrups would bring his parents around.

No luck.

While I was out with Carrie Austin tried the same thing; letting the baby chirp and chirp to see if the adults would return, but again, no results. Austin went inside and left the box in my art room below the open window so the peeping could be heard outside. 

But, when I got home that night the little quail had gotten so cold that he lay sprawled in the shavings, motionless on his side. 

We thought for sure he was dead.

I scooped him up in my hands feeling so sorry for the tiny bird, and suddenly he gasped for breath. I immediately went under the heat lamp and gently rubbed his tiny body over and over until he started to fluff back up and get to his feet.

Austin found a syringe in the medicine cabinet and filled it with water. While I held the chick Austin carefully, and one drop at a time, gave the bird a drink.

We were up until two am with the little thing making sure he was warm and hydrated. Once he bedded down with tired eyes we let him be. 

The next morning while I was at work Austin took the chick up the street where a quail family was finally found and so the little bird was released.

He was so cute... I hope he's now one of the bigger quail I see running around.

It really isn't all that often I get to sit down and concentrate on a sketch.

Sometimes I can start, but I never get to finish as I'm pulled away for one reason or another.

But I did sit down and I drew this, and then sent it to Austin while he was at his softball game.

Besides that we're in a little township called ""Millcreek"", besides the quail that run around the yard, besides the fact I actually have an entire room dedicated to all of my art stuff..

... I think that one of my favorite things about this house has to be the key to the front door.

Yup, that really truly is my house key. I love, love, <i>love</i> it.

We were told that the front door is original still from 1929.

Isn't it the neatest door you've ever seen? Still alive and well and functioning with a <i>skeleton</i> key for goodness sake. 
Can't get much better a door than that.

The potted wonders brought home from nurseries keep lining the east wall of our garage and the west side of our patio as I unload someone new from my car almost every day after work. 
I need to get them in the ground, but first need a plan and a mountain of stepping stones.

In the meanwhile, a few details to share:

If the image in my <a href=""http://mycandacejean.livejournal.com/37789.html"">other entry</a href> didn't give it away... I chopped off all of my hair.
<br><center>
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b231/razelimitations/haircut.jpg"" img size width=540 height=405></center><br>
To have it done I went and saw Nicole, my old friend from junior high and high school.
We used to be band nerds together. Seriously.

It's been a couple of weeks now and it still feels weird. She cut off my pony-tail and set it on the counter in front of me, and still had a few inches left to go before she was finished. My hair was <i>long</i>.

I thought it would be a nice change and definitely good for summer. 
Plus, it was for a <a href=""http://www.locksoflove.org/""> good cause</a href>.

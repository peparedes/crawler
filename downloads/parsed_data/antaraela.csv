I was wondering if I'd ever run into him again.

"event","Glory be.  I've finally finished my fourth go at flight training.  I'm really hoping this is final.  It seems so unfair that I have been transferred like this.  I miss you, baby!  I know the day is nearer that we'll be together, but why is hope like this so futile?  Or so it seems futile when I have worked my hardest every day to deal with the difficulties of our occupation?

You told me that I'll be the only one in your eyes and that we will not have to be parted ever again.  I have only doubts that things will be so splendid, it seems like there is so much more work left to be done.

I feel as though I have tried to bide my time in every way possible, but I still have no riches, barely any beyond my stipend.  We know I take little comfort in material things, but you're so far.  I hit a glitch in transit to d'Sci, and a few of the gifts you gave me were lost.  It was all I could do to accept that I'll never see those things again, and to keep faithful that I will again see you.  

And it's been no trouble staying celibate and all.  I feel colder than 0 Kelvin.  Am I dead?  I don't know the answer to that question anymore.  I thought I was made to be alive, and still I feel only as an automaton preforming my duties as I put a facade over my struggle to do the best I can."

"event","I've been marooned on the lunar base since like, 7 forevers.
This sucks.
Encryption failed on a few of our communiques and we had to re-employ two mercenary agents.

It aches my head.
I got to see Cameron about a month ago, and he got to see me.
We were both in decompression from deep sea research.  Our voices were all fucked up.  I didn't believe it was him because his hair grew out.  I didn't even realize he was an officer because of his composure.  I thought he was just some biology student from one of the research teams.

He was so exhausted.  He looked a few shades of blue.  He explained that he was testing experimental technologies, section 8 classified, so we couldn't talk about it but he could explain it to me using telepathy.  I hadn't had a telepathic connection in 5 years so it was overly exciting.  My discharge was accelerated, much to my disappointment, and he didn't seem surprised.  It's just that I still require eye contact for that protocol to be effective, and that made the romantic part of our equation terribly frustrating.  

Adults are not supposed to blush like that.  Especially not professional adults.

Base is cold and motionless as usual.  And since the gates are all broken, it has had no repair in like 17 or 18 years.  The food left from rations is truly disgusting, and I've lost a bit of weight.  I'm constantly fatigued.  There are only 3 other people manning right now, and I can't return to the labs until I go up for review in a month.

I've been so tired of returning to training.  But that was better than this, even when it was repetitious.  I'd rather be stuck in a game that I can beat than be isolated in a decaying station looking over my own work and awaiting the results of my review.

There's only one other officer here right now, and the other two administrators here are civilian.  We're at minimum staff right now, and there have been rumors that the station will be abandoned permanently because of the expenses being rerouted to the gate controls.

Par d'Scivianni looks like a palm tree... the loneliness here is not fun.  The other officer here is only section 6, and she is in charge of data integrity.  I hate being reduced to the point where I am jealous of those ranking lower than me just because they get to work.

There are no more animals here, and plant research has dwindled.  Eating freeze dried neopolitan ice cream doesn't make me feel the sweetness of anything at all.

The botany professor here has been talking about horseback riding.  I haven't done that in close to 15 years.
I've ridden a camel, and an elephant even more recently.

The simulators that were originally operating here were long ago exported to Battery and so all I can do is attempt to focus my imagination.  I've just been so depressed.  I can't even play a drum.  I can't read or listen to music anymore.  All I can do is put in my 15 hour shifts of pretending that I am not exhausted and anemic.  S6 Officer Yvon knows that I'm faking.  I admire her prudence in not attempting to discuss the reason for my enstationment.   I'm in a lot of pain so I have to cut this short.  I want to say more but I can barely form the sentences.

I love you and Jon.  Cameron says after my review we'll get to visit in a nicer part of l'Par."

Recieved from: The Office of Section 7 Counsel Liaison to the Crown Amzoa

Recipient: Dr. Cameron J. Scienti c/o Raine Scienti
Transcript as follows:

Babe, I'm so stressed.  Right when it seemed certain that I was done with my flight training, I got caught up in a fucking identity loophole with one of the tracers.  I am trying not to panic right now, but when Jin isn't around, I get totally worried.  

I was informed that I have to waive my 24 minute test flights permanently.  If that wasn't enough of a disappointment, I was reassigned in the middle of my auditing to act as a Liaison for the queen, and some of the reassignment procedures wiped you in the process.  Now that the office has the info they needed from Section 6, I've got to go back to munitions, catch up on about 9 generations of remote-controlled dynamic surveillance equipment, and have my eyesight corrected all over again.

Since I am no longer eligible for 24 minute test flights because of the bargain, I'm stuck with relays and TK leases until my next leave.  

I hope we can get together soon.  It's been weeks since I've caught a dreamscape of you.

I hate touring munitions.  I hate having my eyesight corrected.  And I really hate the decontamination process us cyborgs get forced to go through.

Raine got the postcard from one of my leases into Seattle.  Last time I spoke to her, she said you got it, and that you were seeing what you could do with gramps about extending my next leave.  I have the analogue tracing students currently verifying the timeline for Kaibaze Section 9.

I have to go.  I love you.

i got transferred again, i bypassed section 8, can you fucking believe that?  wooooooooo!!!!
anyhow, it is so nice to see you there.

i missed you too!

what, i didn't hear that.  pick up your reciever.

raine: seeing you this clearly is such a relief.  it feels like 15 years since i've seen you last.

oh.. feels like more than that to me, but you know how it is when you start training for deep space.

raine: ya baby.  cameron got transferred to MIT while you were gone.

wow, that's incredible.  how long has it been since you recieved a broadcast from me?

raine: about 3 years, hun.

damn, cause it's only been half a day for me.  i hate being pushed around the accealis system on short notice, because you never know what they're going to sneak into your ""bonus"" contract they hide behind your objectives.  i had to return to flight training 3 times since i left california for reunion.  they had me going through multiclassified crap like you have no clue, and they had to start doing genetic modifications to me.  by the time i got through the third sequence, i got put back in a clone of my original body and it felt fucking awful.  i mean, all my tattoos were gone.  i had plain hair again.  i wanted to go back to being a machine.. and i hated myself for it.  how dare they make me give up my tattoos! gawd, the promotion crap is insane for girls.
you're so lucky cameron's a boy.  he won't have to lie to you like i have to lie to 99% of the time to 90%  of my family just to live with myself.  i just hope he doesn't get too distracted.

raine: well, that's not going to be possible.. he is in the department of interior with ricky now.

are you shitting me?  oh yeah.. a lot can happen in three years.

raine: that good word you put in was why we ever had to get transferred out of parswig in the first place.  we were actually on vacation when we met you.  it was pretty funny seeing you in a real body after we'd only known your adult form from working on simulations together.  you were so adorable, really.  how old are you right now?

i uhmm.. god, i'll have to ask.  its been so long since i've worked on gregorian time that i can't calculate it automatically anymore.  hold on.

raine: k

##

alright, they say that i'm turning 21 on august third.  shit i mean 22.  23?  gawd.  they said they had to change my birthdate every time i went through flight training.  i'm missing two years.  my original sequence would have me turning 22 on a different day this year but one of the broken portals corrupted some junk and so on.

raine: don't i know it.  i actually get to talk to ricky and cameron about 5 or 10 minutes a day, and they can send me faxes too.  can you believe that?  faxes.

shit, faxes... i haven't sent a fax since my first flight training.

raine: hahaha i know!  but i'm in butt-fuck, egypt you know?  satellite or copper line.  i can't afford a special link and even if i could, i can't have one.  im in a subsidy right now.

for real? a subsidized boat?

raine: this isn't a boat honey.  it's a fucking treehouse.  isn't that cool?

a house made of trees?

raine: no.. a house built in a really bigass tree.  or cluster of trees.  we had to have the bunks and fixtures set up this way to conserve space.  but being up in the tree makes it easier for me to adjust the satellite or keep an eye on the forest traffic, shit like that.

damn, where are you?

raine: i can't say because of the stupid protocol.  right now it's just classified as a tribal autonomous zone in north america.  it's in the rocky mountains.

man, i wish i could recieve smell via uplink.  i haven't smelled mountain air since i was 17.  and that was like 20 years ago for all i care.

raine: it's nothing special.  it's actually not far from a freeway, and all the usual par'd'civiani congestion.

it's not pronounced par d'sciviagni anymore?

raine: pop culture fucks everything up, what can i say?

hahaha.  shit.  well next time we get to have leave together, i'm going to dress up fucking 100% hoity-toity, smoke very long cigarettes, wear expensive looking synthetic furs, and spit on people who mispronounce it in front of me, except for you and your family of course.

raine: only if i can smoke very long pipes, wear expensive looking synthetic leather bikerslut clothes, and glare at people worthy of your spit.

hahahaha i don't have leave for another year and a half.  i can't wait to visit.

raine: neither can i.. your leave has been scheduled to correlate with ricky and cameron's promotion in par'd'civiani so i really look forward to it.  in fact, ricky and cameron managed to get ahold of some postcards and relay them to me, and it looks like you have a letter from katie and nicole.  want me to read it to you?  it's from around the time of your third flight training.

oh my god.. i totally forgot about them.. 

raine: but they never forgot you.  they were really sad you were only at their school for a month because they thought that your little band would be the best thing ever.  when you got transferred on a section 9 emergency, they were totally dumbstruck.  you'd only been close for three weeks and never even got a chance to record anything.. they didn't manage to track down a contact for you until 2003.  it's 2005 right now.

oh okay, read me the postcard, woman!

raine: heh.. okay.
<i>man.  your little cult of boys is going nuts without you.  it's starting to make us sick.  not as sick to death as we are missing you, with how you were forced to leave abruptly and all.  but we're really happy to learn that your promotion went well and look forward to seeing you after the lameine of 2006.
it's been pretty hard not to think about what you've been having to put yourself through in that department, but the silly boys keep talking all this espionage guerrilla warfare shit like it's no tomorrow and they don't even watch the news.  they talk about it like you're a hero and some shit, and they don't even listen to us anymore.  they had you all wrong, and the stuff you managed to get through to jon, benny, and elfstar totally went through the sieve.  jon is in prison, benny ignored your advice and enlisted in the army [but he regrets it some, he wishes that he had remembered and feels sorry that he wasn't able to return the favor you did him].. and elfstar is dead, but i think you know that.  he exchanged a pact with some other guy so that it wouldn't get lost to the wind..
anyhow.  hope you get this soon.  -katie and nicole-</i>

i miss seeing katie's handwriting.

raine: she typed the postcard.. they never have the time to write anything by hand anymore.  they got placed in one of the gate protocol auditor's offices, and they're working their asses off developing the evacuation harbors.

oh <i>wow</i>, all i can think of when i think of them is how much fun we had dressing each other up and tearing up the garage with acoustic instruments.  that was the best semester that i ever flunked more than one class, in all of my life.  hehehe..

raine: and look where it got you.  you can't even see your own boyfriend until you return to section 7 to audit your fourth level of training.  isn't that sad?

shut up, haha.  that's not fair.  they wiped his face from my memory too, you know.  i can only visualize him when i draw cartoons, and it winds up looking like the undead.

raine: oh. sorry, i didn't know what security you were in.  i assumed you were at the base, your transmissions are chronologically fucked, you recall?

i thought they'd have fixed that by now.. raine, the base has been destroyed by a runaway judicial ship

raine: that bypassed an update transmission we sent to kaibaze section nine when we lost the final gate.

oh my fucking lord.  i didn't want to believe that rumor was true.

raine: they can't verify it on your coordinates yet because half of your staff is in suspended animation-

oh.

raine: -including you.  except you have the ven5 nexus implant which allows interior at ourobouros to manipulate your state of suspension, and that's why they were able to let you operate through clones.  you're really the crowning achievment, no.. that's not quite the right way to put it.  

yeah, i was going to get defensive there.

raine: you're the most successful experiment in consciousness that the laboratories still keeps under tight wraps.  you know, all your clones have been terminated successfully, but there was a problem.  your organic body didn't survive, and instead of making you lease into a clone next time you have leave, they're going to put you into a new genetic body.

i don't care, as long as i get my tattoos back.

raine: hahahaha, at least you have your priorities straight.

you're going to have to help me on that.  i don't know what's happening between now and 2006, much less what time it is right now at any given moment.

raine: don't confuse yourself.  it's still march of 2005.  you won't have all of your tattoos back though.  just the ones that eric manages to draw for you while you're living close enough to visit him.

oh oh.. shit, i have to leave reno?

raine: don't worry about that yet.  you're still in the station right now?

yeah... and my leasor is dedicated right now.  it has been a very long time since i could get a full connection like i have now.

raine: okay.  well, just go ahead and enjoy yourself for now, don't sweat it too much.  i don't think they're going to be transferring you abruptly for a few years, and hopefully forever.  it was really rough taking your clones out of the timeline.

don't i know it..

raine: yeah.  it was fucking rough for me because a couple of the clones resisted because they didn't stick to protocol and found out about their legal status.  and one of them was lost in asia for a very long time.  the clones that resisted had to be taken out by ricky, and it was really rough on him.  he couldn't talk to me about it until cameron got transferred into his department.

oh my god.. i can't imagine.  i can't imagine.  i wish the termination process could've been more hardwired, but that's just reality..

raine: well, he got over it by overseeing your accealis procedures every time you got sent back to flight training, and it helped keep him on track for the harder things he and his unit have had to do about the miedier family.

god, i miss her.. how are her kids?

raine: not so good.  they had to be evacuated from the mountain because the volcano started to smoke and it was making everyone sick.

okay..

raine: they're actually not far from here, but the clergy all had to return to interior at ourobouros too.  so that's really been the majority of ricky's work recently.  taking care of kids by proxy.  it's easier than you'd think.  most of them take care of each other, and cameron hired some college kids to help make it easier on alicisima.  

so cameron's been getting more vacation time than ricky?

raine: departmental regulations instated since your enlistment.  they changed the legal age of a minor to 25, unless they have filled out their draft card.  cameron enlisted while he was still under 18 by appointment from ricky's commander, and that meant that he would only be able to work 3 months a year until he turns 25.  it's really hard to explain because it doesn't make sense to me even after seeing ricky's work and your work firsthand.  you know everything else is completely ordinary, except for the occasional visit to the post office.  

oh yeah, you live in a tree.

raine: don't say it like i'm a monkey, girl.

oh, really, i wish i could join you, but i don't know how to climb trees anymore.. 

raine: that's a shame.  there is an elevator though.  well, a pulley system.

oh, how cool.

raine: we're only about 15 feet off the ground.  it seems like a lot if you're indoors but 15 feet is nothing.

ah.  rainey, i'm getting tired.. but i'll talk to you as soon as i can.

raine: don't sweat it tara.  just relax and enjoy the retreat.  it'll be wonderful if you can just be patient with the rest of the process.

it's hard to be patient sometimes.. 

raine: then drink to it.  write to me by hand next time.  katie misses your handwriting.

she said that?

raine: no, but she'll be happy to see that you're alive and breathing, so draw her some freaky shit so she knows that it's really you.

awesome, see you later.</lj-cut>"

"event","i got a better lease, i should be able to get this translated more quickly.

so for a month now, i've been chasing the tail of this bizarre letter which was originally recieved in the following context:
<i>oh boy yu du the way you fe'ling
in my living gentle breathing du decieve
i'll recieve u my skeletal flux cia vision
lades mianag geir ril gehlvianas
dormainagasenasiva selcev miadelva

''l'sshini'cia mau'li'ci'adori'n'mau.. graci.</i>
now, as you can imagine, we immediately thought it was scrap, but because of its signatures verification, we double checked with linguistics like i said before.  one of the guys on the shift happened to work as a translator for primarily asian dialects and was raised in a latinist and germanic family.  but he also happened to be raised on a navajo reservation for a part of his childhood, and said that the message was most likely recieved in the wrong alphabet altogether.  so we had it compared to other alphabets in the language simulation q&a system and it wound up returning a multiplicitous result, which is highly unusual.  it apparently read several possible translations from different alphabets, all of which made sense [at least poetically speaking], but the syllables were really bizarre.  so that one specialist from that shift got assigned temporarily to assist on my case because this was taking a lot of time out of my flight training.. and i was getting pissed that i was the recipient whether it was intended to be me or not.

raine, everything that you ever told me before you got sent to the witness protection program with ricky, it's making me sick how true it was, and i had no idea.  i really didn't think anything of your placement because the cases in the papers seemed like the perfect explanation.  but the fucking cutoff clause, shit.  i had no idea and i am sorry i didn't explore it further.. i enlisted with such enthusiasm because of your brother's death.. please forgive me.. i know you do but i want to dream it that you are assuring me you do..

well.. what you said about the lunar interchange corruption cover up.. it was worse than you had discovered, much worse.  it wasn't only three gates that broke.  all of the gates but one were left!  there was a bunch of interference from a runaway judicial ship from kaibaze section 9 that bypassed an update transmission during a breach.
they decided to start doing biometric energy mining, and it was far more elaborate than the scenarios you guys came up with 11 years ago.  it's hard for me to talk about it and my leasor is about to be terminated.. so hang on there, and make sure cameron gets home safe.. i saw one of the postcards when i was in flight training so, tell him i'm here to watch him make section 5 in record time.  i think i put in a good word for him with the director of ccciii-analogue.  the dimensional expansion process is being successfully counteracted, at least by our measurements, and you should be in one of the nicest hideaways by now, and i'm sorry that he had to be transferred to section 2 for that long.  no one likes having to go back to that and look at the stupid creatures who can't think as fast as you, but all you can do is hope the acceleration works on your enstationment.

i miss ricky,  give him two hugs and a cheek kiss for me.  talk to you soon.  i should manage to get a visual feed next time so that i don't have to send the boys in blue to you."

"event","raine.. you won't believe what happened! well, aside from the sheer incredulity of recieving a letter from the future from an alien.  witnessed by freaking government officials.  but that's beside the point, and i apologize for my terrible panicked composition but i think you understand me for real..

i was in my weekend review at the station when i came upon a semi-encrypted letter that was misaddressed to me, or so i thought.  i brought it to linguistics and they realized that it was a decasonic cipher and had it matched with some of the solid runic codes, came up half blank and half unnatural.  for the past week i've been in par d'sciviagni inland terminal, totally lost.  when the people in rinault were talking about how this city is the most extraordinary clockwork, they really weren't kidding.  i didn't have any idea, even after visiting the tourist simulations, how immense and alive this city is.  they had me on a special time slot when they transferred me to the city, and i didn't know that meant that i would be going to a literal different timescale synchronos.  i really didn't understand that could be possible on the same planet, but now it all makes sense to me.  sometimes i wish that i didn't do the clean enlistment.. if i had gone through the federation of sandiavin to train as a specialist, this wouldn't have fazed me at all.. but enough boohooing from me.

i've been lost for like, two weeks here, trying to figure out where i was supposed to recieve the downlink so i could return to my base, and i was transferred directly to the department of interior at halcyon koronos.  i fainted.
shit, you will recieve the broadcast again in a couple minutes, i ran out of dataspace."

"event","just when i thought that i was prepared for the first 24 minute test run, i came upon a clause in one of the alternate language footnotes.
apparently every life form up to the 7th dimension is protected by halcyon nonform treaties.  no wonder you have to be at your fourth yuga in karmic servitude before you can bridge manifestations.

as i was being briefed for my next 10 minute [the musicians in my bunk room refer to it as the TK...] deployment during my 6th month training period, i kept getting the drone baritone and it was bugging me to nuts.  i had to re-read the damn cleft notes for my 305 pathways to translate the aquiesence of the vibrado encrypcions.

i've actually put in a lot of top notch work and this is my first leave under section 7 clearance.  i'm happy about my promotion and everything, even if it means that i'll be a eunuch until karmatic execution.  i'm satisfied with the work my afterlife kids got done, especially the ones that grew up with katie's friends.

oh, the TK.  one of them was sitting around, listening in on the latest Kennedy gossip that made it through the Recombinant Resort [And Carrier Hotel] that serves as the primary freeway between the belt of Orius [not Orion, some other dude that isn't a constellation..] and Section 10.  Section 10 is the stupidest misnomer there ever was in the intraversal structure.  Ten is incorrectly signified as being that which comes after Section 9.  Section 10 is the base ""0"" and the first bit in a galactic mandala.  It is additionally one of the Decasonic Macroterrastruct of a planet in linguistic isolation from other intelligent life forms.  people who read your work think this stuff is happening on Earth but they don't even know they aren't even born yet.  it's lame.  stupid idiots.  adios.

i still haven't gotten briefed on the cloister seal sequences since i haven't finished my test ""flights"".
but um, TK means a googleplex of things, many of them conundrums or mirrors.  ti que, a-t-k, @?, tele/kines, touras kronos.
the reason they are ten minutes long, is because you have to go through a finite sequence of cognitive immersion ""trances"" [i really can't figure out the right words to use, even scientifically avoid].. before both your transdimensional metagnosis can pass in electromagnetic transparency without affecting the ""bubbles"" of regions in spacetime: & you've gotta have your course determined by the signatures you develop as a division unit.  

i feel pretty guilty for all the stress i've been putting on katie for what, with-all.. disturbing rene's spacetime on accident because i failed to catch a signal unit from signa-ouroscienti-6.  i should probably withdraw early even if i am on leave.  see you in a few weeks, SO6.  fixing the mistakes is way fun when it's only test runs ^_^"

"event","i'm still reading the manual on gate bypass protocol TORTUGA but it's *so* thick.  i can't stand this shit.
it's all part of the contract that i must forego direct download and direct client connection transfers when it involves information this sensitive.  i have to walk into the motherfucking mothership, read the thickass book once, <b>memorize it</b> in one damn take, and hope that my body remains intact.
it's just like veruca salt in charlie and the chocolate factory.  but it's more about attitude than timing.

katie's eating mommy's baked chicken right now.  jeez, it smells so good.  i can't wait to gain access to the physical senses though.  it's really hard being present in the world having only sight and smell and conduits that do with us what they please.  

i can't agonize about being a ghost, but a lot of the other kids do.  that's why they keep dying in combat.  it makes me sick to my stomach so i'll try to permanently avoid that topic.

eric's been playing xenosaga like crazy, it's almost annoying now, because he won't stop acting like Jin.  sure, Jin's katie's favorite male hero ever, but Jin isn't eric eric.  but he loves being in Jin's body, making me be Shion so he can be in battle with Katie Kosmos as much as possible.  some boys hide it so well, but eric doesn't bother.  he's too badass to hide stuff like that.

anyway i still only have 10 minute leases to transmit at my current rank, so i've got to return to duty.
xoxo brothers and ..!., >_< ,.!.. rudeboys."

"event","the initiation procedure is complete.
finally, as i am welcomed aboard, i feel the hint of completeness hit me like a lead slug in the gut.
but my body aches as crushed steel in my legs as i come out of shock."

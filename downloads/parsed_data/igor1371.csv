"event","What is an ""ANGEL""? Many have asked this question and many more have pondered its meaning.

But, really what is an ""ANGEL""?

First off, let me go into a little background about myself.  I am or was I should say a United States Marine Corps Reservist from the state of Washington and now am on active duty stationed somewhere in Iraq on an airfield.  I am working outside my MOS (job speciality) on this airfield's flightline, and doing a damn good job. We send out and recieve everything from troops to cargo destined for all parts of Iraq, Kuwait, for Army, Navy, AirForce, and Marines.  I've seen so many uints come in and out over the past 3 weeks.  And seen so many faces...  But, enuf of that and back to the question at hand.

The church or ""chruches"" define ""Angels"" as; ""Beings of light and wisdom, with long flowing white robes, large spread wings and the occasional halo.""  But, I ask you this; Has anyone ever seen one?

Well I have...
Only their description differs quite abit from what would be expected...

In my dealings with the troop movements on and off this airfield I have seen 3 ""Angels"" over the 3 weeks i have been here.

Let me explain...
An ""ANGEL"" is a term that we use to describe the body of a Soldier/Marine that has paid the ultimate price to give freedom to people that derserve it and given his/her life in the line of duty.

I myself have the honor of being part of the honor detail that watches as the Angel gets placed aboard an aircraft heading back to the rear areas and then back home 3 times.  And was both honored and humbled by the experiences....

So if asked the question; What is an Angel?  My responce would be; An Angel is one that is carried to an aircraft by a team of 6 in a flag drapped coffin and placed onboard beneath a flag hanging from the center of the cargo area to rest for the long journey home, for their job is done and service complete.  On behalf of a greatful nation I salute you, and thank you for your sacrifice."

and all the crazy things you do
the way you like to make me laugh
and cheer me up when I am sad
the way you tell me how you feel
I know its meaning is for real
the way you look in my eyes
the way you never told me lies
I thought and i walked
and I thought some more
until I realized I was at your door
and when I saw your smiling face
I knew why I come to this place
I come to tell you how much I care
and need to do it while were here
together standing face to face
I know how much I like this place
and looking deep into your eyes
I have come to senses and realize
it is your love that keeps me strong
I should have known this all along
and now I see it in my mind
I'll be with you till the end of time"

"event","What is LOVE? Such a mysterious word LOVE.. four letters two consonants and two vowels put together in an almost hodgepodge.. I have spent some time trying to ponder this...what is LOVE?  Is it the feelings two people share when they deeply care about one another? Is it the feeling of want when something has been there but now is gone? Is it the feeling one gets when the other is away and can't stop thinking about the other?  Is it the act of lovemaking?  Is it hoping for something that could happen but might not?  Is it having something that doesn't actually need to be had?  Can love be blind? Can love see? Can love conquer all? What is love... Can two people love eachother, yet not have as much trust in eachother as they did in the beginning? Can that trust be brought back? I certainly hope so. Does it have to be earned? Or can it just grow back? Can time away from physical LOVE strengthen a relationship?  What if one strays from love? All these questions.. and many more have come up.. alot of which escape me at present. Perhaps I may have said too much? Or maybe too little? 

Someone very dear to me gave me something a while back... and I'm not sure she remembers...or if she even knows I still carry it everywhere I go? Its a little cast aluminum coin of sorts...nothing really fancy...alomst the size of a quarter...but written on it are the most deep words i had read at the time.. and have read in a while...

..The front reads: Love is Patient. Love Is Kind. Love Never Ends.

..And the back reads in bold:  TRUE LOVE WAITS

All I know right now.. is I love.... and the one I love is having doubts. She may deny it to me.. but I can sense it..she has had doubt before.. but together we overcame those doubts.. but now she is away and I can feel her doubts again, and I don't know what to do.  One of my ""friends"" says I should move on.. but every bone in my body is saying....hang on...I'm trying... but i don't know what else to do..."

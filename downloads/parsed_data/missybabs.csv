"event","alright tonight has to be one of the best nights ive had in a while! tonight i also went with a special kid to the hockey game.  we were soposed to go with sondra but she brought along someone she knew i didnt get along with so i decided to let her be with them.  after the hockey game we didnt know what to do so we went to go and get another friend:) we picked him up and got some dunkin donuts which was soooo good. we stoped at the rest stop on the highway which sounds a little fishy but it was alright because it was the only place u can just sit there and talk without getting questioned.  so we did that, as we were leaving we got followed by another creepy guy. this is turning into a habit with these things. after that we went driving and just talked.the ""other friend"" that we had along wa bugging me on who i liked because i would never tell him...but he definetly did know.  the driver knew because it was him but the passanger made him swear on his grandpas soul if he knew who it was and eventually he cracked.  it kinda feels better because now it is somewhat out in the open but noone really will know until something happens with another couple then the world will know. i really hope it is soon tho because i just keep falling for him...but i like it:)...well i will most likely see him tomorrow so ill write back then!"

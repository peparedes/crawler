"event","So everything has been going pretty steady lately. NIN is next month!!  Converge is in November. Depeche Mode is going on tour again....what? oh yes! I will be waiting an eternity for those tickets and tour dates to be released. 

Work is work and going as well as it can. We were robbed...but they caught him. He tried to steal 8 dvds...this being his 3rd attempt or so..they finally got him. Moron. Apparently he can really run.

Front 242 show in Ybor City also in November..totally looking forward to this for two additional reasons:
1. Visit Sandi hopefully while down in Fla!
2. The Castle!!

Friday- Corpse Bride with the siblings. 
That night...anyone up for something? Let me know! Im actually off that entire day!And dont work until late on Saturday.

912-656-1465..but most of you know that.

Today was a bust...Patrick dropped me off at school and my first class was canceled. So I go downstairs to ask the secretary of the english department if I can use their phone cause I needed to call my ride. She said it could not be used for any public use and she was sorry....Sorry? You canceled my class and are now telling me out of your ridiculous rule, I cant call my ride to come pick me up??? wtf? I asked her again and she said absolutely out of her hands.What a bitch. And there aren't any pay phones...so thanks college for once again beating me down and letting me know how much you really care..I didn't want to go to German anyway today."

"event","So My city is having a small crisis....WERE OUT OF GAS!!! 

Today is supposedly the last day to get gas for the next 3-4 days. We get our gas from the gulf coast and well most of the oil riggs are destroyed and floating happily along the flooded land..or some crazy end of the world shit like that. So thankfully I drive an SUV. God I was really worried there for a second! 

People are lined up in EVERY gas station in town..It took me 40 minutes to get gas. 

You know what,,,


FUCK YOU BUSH..this is ALLLLLL your fault..you stupid motherfuckin hick. We'd have enough gas...but oh no...you know Im not even going to get into this.."

"event","So the process of ACTUALLY moving in is slow...and I havent really gotten the chance to hang out with anyone. But I am hoping to make that up tonight. I start work today. 330-close. If you get bored come see me. Those who can come see me anyway. Oh Barnes and Noble you silly thing you...but it should be good, I really like my job. 

My last few days has been filled with trying to get my computer fixed, buying books for classes, dying hair, getting my car air fixed, putting new stuff in the apartment, trying to deal with my mom who hates the idea of me doing anything I really want that doesnt involve her. Like moving...

As for anything else..I'm trying to keep uo with people and am just sort of waiting for NIN...god it's going to be a long 2 months. And so far as been a REALLY long week. Sorry if I'm not as around as usual yet."

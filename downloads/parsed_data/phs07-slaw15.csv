First of all, Cross Country is a KILLER!! haha...It is so painful and stressful...I am so sore from practices and meets...

I love my girls! I don't know what I would do without them!! 
-Running make you lose control!
-Floor dancing!
-G,G,G, Nite!------> HAHAHA
-There is too many to list! haha

That is really all that I feel like writing at the moment!

First of all, the beach was wonderful! Too bad that we couldn't have stayed longer! I love the beach...I wish that I could live there! haha

Cross Country has officially started! It has been so hot and we have ran so good. We have been running at 4:30, but that's how it's gonna be at meets...

We already are on Heat Schedule. We heard on the radio today. It lasts up until Wednesday...then we get out at 12:00 for Kid's Day. I am so excited about that.

Friday there is a football scrimmage and I am excited just for the fact that it's football season. I am so excited about cheering! haha

I can't believe that my Junior year is finally here. We will be getting class rings next week and it blows my mind. I can't believe that my high school years are drawing to an end...okay, enough of the sad thoughts.

On another sad note though, the 20th I am going up to Va. Tech with Justin and his family for move in day. I know that it is going to absolutely kill me, but I know that he will be in every weekend to see me, and that will make it even more special! 

I am so glad that I have been getting to see my girls! You don't know how much I have missed them! I love 'em!!

I love all of my new school clothes that I have bought. That is my favorite part about school starting back!!

I put some photos on my photo page.

Leave me some love!

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Yesterday was mine and Justin's 19th month anniversary. So, to begin the day, we shall start with that morning. First of all I went to church with Justin and then went home with him afterwards. Then we hung out for a while and ate. His family grilled out and we had hotdogs. Then we went inside and watched some t.v. and played with his cousin, Trevor. After that, we went outside for a while and then Justin decided that he wanted us to go to the top of this hill and pick some blackberries. So we did that, and it was really fun!&nbsp; So then we came back home and ate so of em and watched t.v. I was laying down and ended up falling asleep for about 45 minutes. Then at 5:40, Kristina and Rach came and woke me up and told me that I needed to start getting ready. So I got ready and then Rach and Kristina, and me and Justin went and saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I really liked it minus the Oompa-Lumpa's(I know that isn't spelled right so nobody laugh!! haha) Anyway, so then that ended and my mom came and picked me up. And then of course I went home. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Today I'm going to work and today I have a late night. It will be a long day! haha....After I get off work Rach and I are going to run on our own because everyone else is running at 7:00, but I don't think that I will be off in time to run at 7:00.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>I am so pumped up about cheerleading camp. We leave on Thursday and then I come home and Saturday, and we leave Sunday to go on vacation. Justin is going with us, so I'm so excited! Justin is going to Tech on Wednesday and coming home Friday. He is going up there for orientation. I know that he is excited, but I am so dreading when he leaves. I just know that I won't be able to accept the fact that is 18 years old and going to college. Speaking of 18, I need to think of something to get him for his birthday. Okay, enough rambling! haha........leave me some love!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Thursday we had cheerleading practice and we practiced what we're going to do for camp. It is too cute! With one practice we have it down so good. After that we stayed and ran for Cross Country...we ran to Napa and then we ran to the Town Hall and played basketball for a little while and then ran back. It was fun.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Friday I worked until about 1:30 and then I came home and got ready and picked up Rachel. Me, Rachel, Sara K., and Katelan went to Megan's aunt's house, Martha. We swam from about 3:00 til around 5:00. It was so nice cause we had pizza, chips, and cookie cake for Megz birthday. It was so fun to just get out and do something! haha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>After that I met Justin at 6:15 and then we went and ate at Yamato's. After that we went back to his house and then Josh called and wanted us to go up to Joseph's house and play Poker. So we went up there until about 10:00 and then we came home. When we got there Justin discovered that he couldn't find his wallet, so we all started looking for it. Finally, he called Josh and asked if they would look for it and call back if they found it, and like one minute later they called back and had found it! haha..........When we got home we decided to watch the video ftrom Florida! I have honestly never laughed so hard in my life!!! My mom came and picked me up about 11:00.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>Today I'm going to work til about 1:30 or so and then I'm going to come home and lay out in the sun for a while. Rachel is having her birthday party tonight at 6:00, so I'll have to get ready for that. </FONT></P>

"event","<P>Well, it has been a while since I have updated this thing. Florida has come and gone. I absolutely LOVED it!! I wish that I could have stayed longer.</P>
<P>We started out at about 11:15 or so on Friday. We traveled until about 10:00 that night. Then we got up and left around 9:00 Saturday morning. We drove the rest of the way and arrived around 1:00 and then we went to Magic Kingdom. As we were starting to leave it started pourning the rain. Sunday morning we got up and went shopping because it was supposed to rain a lot that day and ended up not raining that much at all. Monday morning we got up and went to Epcot. It started raining later on in the night. We watched the fireworks at 9:00 and they were so pretty. Tuesday we went to MGM and we watched this cute little show...it was so funny! haha..We didn't get to ride Tower of Terror because they had to close it done for the day because a girl went unconcious after riding it. Wednesday we went to Cocoa Beach and then we were going to watch the shuttle launch, but they ended up not having it cause something was wrong with the fuel tank. Thursday we went to Animal Kingdom. I loved getting to see all of the cute little animals. Friday we went to Universal and I loved it!! We rode the Hulk twice and Dueling Dragons. I liked them both surprisingly enough! And they were both pretty big roller coasters. We rode some water rides too because it was so hot!!! Saturday we started out at about 9:30 or so and we drove til about 12:15 or so where we met Mike, Vicki, Kelsey Jo, Mikey, Trevor, Shirley, and Ernie and ate lunch with them. We left the mall at around 1:30 and then started back out. We stopped at around 8:00 and ate dinner at Fuddruckers and then kept on coming home. I arrived home at around 12:00 or so. I was so tired! Rachel was so glad to see me and I was so happy to be home. I really missed it. </P>

"event","<P>Well everyone, it has been a while since I have given an actual update. I am getting ready to go to work, so I figured that I would update while I waited.</P>
<P>First of all, I get my licenses on Thursday. I am so excited about it!! My mom said that I had to wait a week or two before she would let me drive to Norton/Wise.. but just so I get to drive! haha</P>
<P>Softball tourneys are this weekend at Coeburn. I hope that it isn't so hot that it's miserable!! We have practice today at 5:30 and I'm really not too sure how long that it is going to last. We have a game at home tomorrow vs. Clintwood. Clintwood, Lee County, and us are the only three teams in our District! So, that shouldn't last too long with three teams.</P>
<P>Work is going good. I have really put in some hours this summer! A lot more so this summer so far than last. </P>
<P>I am VERY excited about going to Florida with Justin and his family. We leave the 8th and come back the 16th....We are going to drive 3/4 of the way on the 8th so that on the 9th we only have about 4 hours to drive, so that we will get to do something that evening. I made a list of all the things that I will be needing to take on the trip last night, so I need to start getting a very things every time that I go to Wal-Mart. I also found out that I needed some shorts because I only have one pair of blue jean shorts. I don't ususally wear shorts, so that would be the reason! haha</P>
<P>On Friday I went to the BFF with Kristina, Rach, Audrey, Jessi, and Alex and then we went back to Kristina's house for her birthday sleepover. We stayed in the hot tub most of the time and it was HILARIOUS!! haha...Then Saturday, Justin went with my family to the Breaks and that was fun. We went to the pool, went to some lookouts, rode the paddleboats, and grilled out. That evening, Justin and I met his parents and we went out and ate and then we went back into his house. We got in the hot tub and it was soooo hot. It was up to 103 degrees and we had to turn it down to 95 but it only got down to 101 when we got out! </P>
<P>I will put some pictures on here as soon as I get them developed.</P>

At his house, we took more pictures and we were done with that by around 6:00. After we finished taking pictures, his mom fixed us some chicken nuggets. They were so good! We left to go to the hotel around 6:55 and arrived there around 7:05. We then took pictures until 8:00 when everyone went in. Justin and I had to take our picture at 8:05, and I really liked our picture. Prom inside was so pretty and I loved it! Then at 11:30 it was the Grand March. I was so cold outside!! I complained the whole time because I was freezing! haha...After that, we went to Justin's house and changed and then went to Katie's after prom party. We stayed there til around 2:00 or so and then we went to his house. After we got to his house, we watched Men In Black. I love that movie and I forgot how much I liked it til I watched it again. I left at like 9:00 the next morning and then I came home and we got ready to go to Norton to exchange a dress that I had bought, go to the grocery store, and then pick up Rachel. I am really sad now that it is over because it just hit me yesterday that it really was over! Now, I have graduation to cry and whine about! 

I am so glad that school is almost out. It saddens me to think that I will be a Junior, but I am so glad that summer is here and I don't have to worry about doing homework or getting up at 6:45 every morning. I love summer because I can sit at home and eat and sleep and catch up on Days! 

We have our first tournament game tomorrow vs. Powell Valley at Powell Valley. I really hope that we do really well and win. It would be wonderful!

Then we had a game at Haysi, which wasn't bad at all. The final score was 5-2. The last time that we played them, we didn't play that well, so it was an improvement. Before the game we stopped at Hardee's and got something to eat. On the way home, we stopped and got Pizza Hut which made me very happy. 

Prom is getting so much closer. I am so excited! Friday we are going to Cheddar's to eat and then we want to go to the mall or do something else afterwards but that is still undecided. Saturday I pretty much have a busy schedule. Justin went and ordered my flowers yesterday because I had absolutely no time to go with him. With softball games everyday, there is like no time for anything really. Well, yesterday 5 of us were asked to play with 5 P.V. girls on this travelling team for about 3 weeks. I said yes and I am really excited about it!

For starters, softball season is almost over. That makes me so sad because next softball season, I will be a Junior. I can't believe that this school year is almost over! It's like my high school career is almost over, so I am going to make the best of it! We did get yearbooks and I have almost got everyone to sign mine.

School is going good right now. Things are getting a lil wild since we are ending the school year. We have an Algebra 2 SOL soon, and that really worries me because I am finding these practice tests really hard!

Wednesday I had the stomach virus! What fun, huh?!?!? After I got to feeling better that day, we went to the Glass Slipper to pick up my prom dress! I absolutely love it and can't believe that prom is in 6 days! The dress is honestly a little too tight, so this week I really need to do some good eating and exercise. I am so excited about prom! haha

The District Track Meet was Friday night at P.V. It came a downpour!! We had to wait forever to be able to run! Kristan and I got caught in the bathroom and had to stay in there for like 30 minutes. Then it was 12:15 before we got home! I was so tired, but I got up and went to work the next morning anyway.

Yesterday I met Justin at five and we went and ate at Shannon's. Then after that we took Rachel, Kristina, Jessie, and Audrey to the JIB Pageant and we went to his house. Then I went 4wheeler riding for the very first time! Justin and I rode his uncles, and his parents rode a friends. We went several places, and I kind of had no idea where we were at one point in time. Everytime that we were close to a mud puddle, I would make Justin speed up so that it would splash all over us! Needless to say, we were a mess. At some points I was scared out of my mind! haha

After we got back, which was about an hour and 1/2 later, we changed back into clean clothes and then we watched T.V. until my mom got there. Kristina spent the night last night, and we went to bed pretty early! We were all just so tired!

I am going to put the lyrics of a song that I really like on here:

YOU AND ME


What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

What day is it?
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive

I only stayed until 10 and then me and my mom went to Wendy's and got something to eat. After that I came home and got on the computer for a while and then I went to bed around 1:00 or so. 

Sunday morning I went to church with Justin and I was at his house until 4:00 and then we came home and I went to the batting cage and then he came with me to my Awana Banquet. After that we got home around 8:00 or so and then he left around 10:00.

Yesterday, we had a game at Coeburn and it was such a good game! The score was 3-0(us) in the bottom of the 7th. There were two outs, and then I don't remember what happened, but I do remember that they started coming back. They ended up tying it 3-3 and we had to go into 9 innings. They ended up winning 4-3. I hate that! I was so upset because to me, it hurts worse to lose that way!

Today we had softball practice in the rain and we worked on defense the whole day. I really like when we do this! We play Burton Thursday at Burton! I think that it will be a good game and I am so excited about it!

Tomorrow we have practice and then we are supposed to have a track meet at P.V. We usually go to Coeburn, but we decided to go to P.V. this week for some reason.

Prom is approaching and I am so thrilled about it. Last night, Justin told me that they couldn't get the tux that he wanted, so we have to go and order another one! I feel sorry for him because he really wanted that one too! I think that I have to get my hair done at 9:30 that morning, which is completely too early, but oh well! I will have to get my make-up done after that and then my nails done. I love to have my nails done!

"event","For starters, we won our game last night which was really good...in the bottom on the 2nd inning, it started raining a little, but we kept playing. Then all of the sudden it came like a complete downpour. Both teams ran in to get in the dugouts to attempt to stay dry. Melissa, Julie Kay, and me had to go down to the baseball field with Coach Shortt to get some Diamond Dry. The bag started breaking because they were soaking wet. On the way back up the hill, Coach Shortt stopped to talk to someone and then his truck wouldn't go, so Mel, Julie, and me were screaming because we were afraid that we were going to go flying off the back of his truck. We finally made it up there though! haha

After the game, my family and Justin went to Pizza Plus and ate, and then we came home. Justin and I watched the draft thing, which was kind of cool. haha

Tonight we have a game at home against Rye Cove and then I have to run and Justin is going to run with me and then come back to my house. 

Tomorrow is prom and I am so excited even though I am not technically going. I have to do the registration and James is doing it with me. About 9:30 or 10:00 Justin is going to pick me up and then he wants me to go to his house. I just love him to death!!

Keisha hurt her knee and I was really worried about her, but she informed me on Friday that she is alright and could possibly be playing on Monday against Appy.

Today we had the NPI meet at P.V. and I was there from 10:00-5:30! haha...what a long day! I got 5th in the two mile and Meg got 4th and I would put what everyone else got, but I don't remember! haha...Everyone did really well!

Tuesday we had a softball game against Clintwood and almost lost to them! They have improved so much since last year!  We came out of it and won 6-3.  Our defense looked awesome! I know that some of it was my fault because my pitching really sucked that night!

Wednesday I didn't go to softball practice because we had our first Track Meet! I was ready for it, but my time for the 2-mile was HORRIBLE! I don't even want to go there with that one, and I'm praying that it drops....A LOT! 

Thursday we had a game against Coeburn at home.  They have really improved since last year as well.  We lost that one 12-1. We really need to start hitting the ball better as a team. Defense is still really strong for us right now.  After that I had Justin to run with me at the track and then we picked up our order from Pizza Plus...which was wrong, but that's okay.haha

Friday we had practice outside from after school til about 5:45. After that I rushed home and took a shower and then Kris and I went to the movies to see the Ring Two. I still got so scared even though I had seen it before.  After that we went to Huddle House and ate which was good.

Today I am going to work and then I have to run and then Justin will be coming over about 6:00.  He'll probably stay until about 11 or so.

*randoms*

Tomorrow Justin is going to Johnson City with my family.
I am so glad that it is finally Spring.
We have a meet on Wednesday and the NPI on Saturday.
Pound's prom is like really soon! haha

Last night, I went and saw the Ring Two with Rach and Kristina and it scared the crap out of me and there was so much butter on our popcorn that I was up half of the night with an upset stomach which wasn't fun at all!

Today was our last day of Spring Break which really upsets me!  Kris and I got to spend some quality bonding time together on Saturday! haha...That game took forever!

Tomorrow we have a game against Clintwood if it doesn't get rained out! I hope that it doesn't because I really want to play!

Today I went to Haley's house and we worked on our poetry pack for about two hours!

Right now I am trying to review some homework and try to go to bed early.

Yesterday-
I went to Kingsport with the family to Rachel's Bible Quizzing for church.  Then we went and ate at Cheddar's and went to the mall in Johnson City.  There I met Justin and his family who I then went with because it was his mom's birthday, so we went to Outback to eat.  At the mall I saw a ton of people that I knew.  To name a few, I saw Luke, Kegan, Cody, Mrs. Houchins and her family, Julie Dotson, Jeff Baker, and more.  Then after we got done eating, Justin brought Kristina and me home, and Kristina spent the night.  WOW! Was it interesting?!?! haha

Today-
I am going to go to church with Justin, again..haha, and then go to his house for a while and then he is going to bring me home later today.

My birthday is next Tuesday.  I am so excited because I will be 16!!  Saturday, my family and Justin, is going to Pikeville to eat at this steakhouse for my dad's birthday(Tuesday) and mine(a week later)!  

For my birthday, I think that I am just going to have the girls up for a while, and just have a girl's night out and catch up on everything!  On my actual birthday, my family and Justin is going to eat birthday dinner, don't know what yet, and just hang out I suppose! haha

I am overly ready for Spring to be here, and I can't wait for the summer.  I just hate the thought of knowing that I have to go to school, do homework, and all that good stuff! haha

I almost forgot the most important thing, POUND DOESN""T HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE!!! That makes me so happy, that you just don't know because I feel very strongly about the situation (well, felt very strongly) but I won't get into that on here! haha

Tomorrow for softball, we are probably going over to Clintwood to practice with them!  Weater permitting that is! haha

My prom shoes should be in in a few days, so I will get to go and try on my prom dress again and then see if it needs to be altered in length. It looks so much prettier than I thought that it would because I wasn't sure what it would look like in turquoise, but I was very happy with it....

Softball practice is going really well....we look pretty go, from what you can tell in a gym...we have a scrimmage March 8 against Wise, and so that will let us see what they have, and see what we need to improve on for the regular season!

I need to start running for track whenever I can! haha

They are calling for more snow, so hopefully we won't go tomorrow either!

Friday is Norton's football banquet, so I am going to that with Justin!

I am so excited about prom! I really need to find my jewelry and how I am going to wear my hair...My mom told me that for my birthday, that she was getting me a gift certificate for a manicure and pedicure...I had one last year and LOVED IT! haha

Today is mine and Justin's 13 month anniversary! (We have been talking/together 15 months today!!!) It is so hard to believe that we have been together for 13 months and never fight! Are we normal?!?!?!?haha...just playing! I honestly do love him more than ANY guy that I have ever been with or talked to, and he knows that! He has told me time and time again, that just becasue he goes to college next year, that will change NOTHING! So, that always makes me very happy to hear!

Saturday night Justin came over to fix the computer..well, as you know, it was pretty much a down-pour! So Rachel had Jessie over and they wanted to spend the night together, so my dad took them to Jessie's house..he came back and said that the roads were too bad and asked Justin if it would be alright if he stayed the night..so we called his parents and they said that was fine! So Justin slept in my sis' room and I slept in my room, and we woke up about 9:30 or so on Sunday and my dad got us Hardee's to eat for breakfast and then Justin went home about 11:00! 
That night, I requested that we watch ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and so we did...then after that, we watched SNL!

Last night, I watched the NFC game and the AFC game with my mom! haha...we had no clue what was going on!

Today we have a game at Coeburn so, I will be attending that tonight to watch!

Meghan and Kristan have been so helpful this week! (Well, what few days we went to school! haha) Meg always carried my backpack to the next class, and rode the handicapped chair thing with me! Kris asked Meg if she could ride it once, so she did as well! I love them to death!!!!! and I don't know what I would do without 'em! I promise that we are going to do something soon gals!

Justin came over last night because he left this morning to go to state... I was so upset that I couldn't go and watch him! I miss you!!!

He is coming back tomorrow night so we will be able to do something on Sunday...so that is always good!

Tomorrow I have two games in Tazwell and then we are going to Pigeon Forge, so that should be fun!

Tonight I have some plans, but I'm not sure that they will go through because I feel like a ""tag-along""..and I hate to feel that way!

Right now I am getting ready to go to basketball practice..I will update later tonight...

Basketball is going good right now! We have a game against Haysi at home tomorrow and I really hope that we do good...we have played two games right now and we have lost them both, but the first game we only lost by one point!

I was so happy that Tennessee did good against Auburn last night! haha

Well, yesterday I went to the kid's Christmas Brunch at 8:30, then I went to Justin's game that started at 1:30, we went to the parade afterwards, we went to Monterrey to eat after that, and then I went to Justin's house!

I honestly do love him and I know that he loves me! So, we are a ""match made in Heaven""......(Meg and Kris...that one was for you two! haha)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Yesterday was also had our first basketball scrimmage and I think that we did very well considering that it was the first time that we had ever played a game together against another team! After my game, I&nbsp; left and had to go to work and I worked from 10:30-5:15 and then I came home and got on the computer for a little while and had some dinner and then Justin called and I talked to him and then I went to the batting cage and then I came home and called Justin back...busy day! haha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Today I am going to Justin's house about 5:30 because we are eating at 2:00 and then I have to go to work from 4-5 to do kennels...Justin and I decided that we were going to watch Elf and then we are going to watch this movie that I watch EVERY year on Thanksgiving....I watched Sweet Home Alabama last night and when I woke up this morning I put in The Grinch and watched it! I have been watching a lot of movies lately!haha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I can't wait to get out the Christmas decorations and being decorating! Christmas is my absolute favorite holiday! I have already started listening to Christmas music and watching Christmas movies!</FONT></P>

Now I am looking forward to getting out for Christmas break!haha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Tomorrow we are going Christmas shopping in Johnson City....I have 11 gifts to buy and I know what I am getting everyone except for Justin...It would make is sooo much easier if he would just tell me what he wanted, but we won't!haha...so I talked to his sister about it and she said that we would casually bring it up and ask him what he wanted and then tell me! I would buy him a shirt, but that it what I have bought him that past few holidays and I don't want to buy him that same thing!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Right now my back is killing me! I don't know why though!

Tomorrow morning we have a basketball scrimmage and then we possibly have practice later tomorrow evening so that we don't have to have it anymore over break...which I personally would LOVE to do! haha

We have practice tonight from 5:15-6:45 and then Justin is coming over since we won't really get to do anything over break...

Friday I am going to Johnson City to get some of my Christmas shopping done and I am looking forward to that as well! haha

Well, I have decided that I am not going to update anymore until I get more than like one comment per entry because I find it useless because it makes me think that people don't read it, or that they find it completely boring...So, I will have to see how that goes!

I am so glad that we only have to go to school two days this week because I really need a break from school at this moment! I am just looking forward to knowing that I don't have to go to school for five days in a row! 

Friday night we had the Midnight Madness at the high school...it was over by like 9:45 and then after that we went to Pizza Plus and ate!

Yesterday, was Norton's first play-off game, so I went to watch Justin...they won over Hurley 53-6...it was a really good game and I found out that Hurley are some really big rednecks! Honestly!

It is so hard to believe that we have been dating for almost 11 months! I honestly love him so much and I know that he loves me and I know that he would never cheat on me and he knows that I would never cheat on him, so we never fight...well, maybe over where to eat, or who loves each other more!...ha ha

Tonight, Rachel had a 7th-8th grade game at Norton...I won't go there! ha ha...

After the girl's game, Justin and I went to Taco Bell and I got a Southwest Steak Border Bowl cause Jaymil told me to get it because it was good, and I loved it! 

My mom told me that I couldn't kiss Justin tonight cause he was sick, but I did anyway! ha ha...she was just joking though! ha ha

Well, that is all that has happened to me because I live a rather boring life! ha ha
I will update when we get back from state, or if everyone is lucky, before I leave!

Leave me some love!
*Much love!"

Last night at the game I saw my great aunt from Illinois(??)....she is in for a class reunion and she is doing wonderful! I wish that I got to see my family from Illinois more so than I do...

Well, we won our game! 34-0! I was so proud because they played a really good game!

After the game my mom and I went to Huddle House to meet Kristina and Justin..we got home around 12 or 12:30 or so..Kristina is going to help me to make a shirt for the football game tomorrow...the shirt is for Norton's Senior Night, and I really dread that night coming because I know that I am going to cry my little eyes out because I get teary-eyed just thinking about him leaving...I love Justin so much!

Well, Justin is coming over to hang out tonight and he should be here in a few minutes so I am going to end this update!

*Leave me some love!

I never had no one that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life

It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend

You're my best friend
You're my best friend"

"event","Well, this morning you could say that I was abused! ha ha...literally! AK and Luke like tortured me ALL morning! I honestly thought that I would be bruised from head to toe, but I'm not surprisingly enough! ha ha

After that, the day was really good....Meghan, Melissa, and me had to run our mile in gym today and we ran it in 7:30! IT WAS SOO COLD!!! ha ha...after that we went to the weight room and then went back to the gym and played DodgeBall..

Today we had to do speed work at the little school, and it was so bad because I had already ran a mile earlier that morning! 

After that, I came home I finished my Biology...well, kinda, then I watched some TV, made Rachel a bracelet, and did some laundry, and know I am on here updating journal...quiet the busy day today, huh?

Leave me some love!

*Much love!

"event","<P>Well, quiet a bit has happened since the last time that I took the time to update! ha ha</P>
<P>Homecoming week was finished out with:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Wednesday-Cowboy &amp; Cowgirl Day</LI>
<LI>Thursday-Rival Day</LI>
<LI>Friday-Spirit Day</LI></UL>
<P>It was so much fun! ha ha.....Well, we didn't win the door, the spirit stick, or the cheer, but we sure gave it our all! We came in 2nd for everything! Even the game that we played! Next though, hopefully we will start working on it sooner so that we won't have to be rushed, cause it was so frustrating working on it at the last minute and I'm sure that we all agree on that! ha ha</P>
<P>We lost our Homecoming game to Coeburn! It wasn't really the best game that I had ever seen(I'm not meaning this to offend anyone on the team)I was hoping that we would get them from the start, or if we were down, that we would do what we did against Appalachia, but it just didn't happen!</P>
<P>After the game was the dance! I acted so CRAZY! I really wonder where I get all of this energy from! ha ha</P>
<P>Yesterday, we had to go to Marion to run a Cross Country race! I actually did better than I had anticipated that I would do! I ran my best time of the year, so that made me very happy! After the race, I came home and took a shower and then went to Powell Valley to Justin's band competition! They won the whole thing which made everyone happy! Well, from Norton that is! ha ha</P>
<P>Well, last night Meghan and Brandon, Shawn and Kristan, and Justin and I were all supposed to go to the movies. Well, for a minute Justin and I thought that we wouldn't be able to go because they might have been throwing a surprise party for the seniors. So Justin told me that I should at least go and eat with them! So I went to Shannon's at the designated time: 7:45! So I saw that Samantha and Jordan were in there, so I asked them if they had seen them, and they said 'no', so I sat with them until they got done eating and Justin got back because no one ever showed up! I went to eat with his parents and him at Monterrey and then we went back to Justin's house! He made me cry last night....not in the 'he hurt me way' but, well I guess you could say it was in that way! We were lying in his floor watching T.V. and for some reason we were talking about college. We he looked at me and said 'I love you' with this little look on his face...I lost it! It made me so sad because I thought about only getting to see him on the weekends, and him being 4 hours away! He tickled me and I started laughing and he was like""That is the Sarah that I want to see!"" So, I quit crying! </P>
<P>Leave me some love!</P>
<P>*Much love!</P>

"event","Well, today was just an ordinary day at school! As usual! ha ha...This week is Homecoming week, so today was P.J. Day! Homecoming week makes me very happy! ha ha...Tomorrow is Twin Day, so I can't wait to see everyone's twins! ha ha

We(the cheerleaders) are working on what we are doing for the pep rally on Friday! We had practice today after school and we have it the next two days as well, so I have to run after cheerleading because Jen said that we couldn't cheer Friday if we miss practice! 

I was supposed to go up to Rachel's after cheerleading, but we didn't get done until 6:30, so I really hope that no one is mad at me,(the Sophomores that is) because I do know it! ha ha

Norton's open week is this week, so he gets to come to the game and the dance with me! It makes me so very happy! ha ha...We are matching and it is gonna be the cutest thing ever! I am going to see if he will come to my house before(cause they don't have practice) and take a few pictures! ha ha..I am such a dork!

I am so pumped up about the pep rally because Sophomores are SOOO gonna win it this year! What we are doing is AWESOME!

We are supposed to have a J.V. football game on Wednesday because of the parade on Thursday, so that is something to look forward to! ha ha

Yesterday I bought the Rascal Flatts cd and it made me so happy!

Leave me some love!
